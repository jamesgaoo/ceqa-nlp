2 allege as follows:

3 INTRODUCTION

4 1. a This is a public interest environmental justice lawsuit to protect petitioners' and the

5 public's rights to a clean and safe environment and to the Board's compliance with the California
6 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code ("PRC") section 21000 et seq., the San

7 Diego County General Plan ("General Plan") and Zoning Ordinance ("Zoning Ordinance"), and the

8 Planning and Zoning Law, Government Code section 65000 et seq. Petitioners bring this action to

9 challenge the Board's approval on August 18, 2021 of Major Use Permit(MUP") PDS2018-MUP-18-

10 022, Preliminary Grading Plan, a Site Plan, a Fire Protection and Mitigation Agreement, a Mitigation

11 and Monitoring Program (*MMP"), CEQA Findings including a Statement of Overriding
12 Considerations, and Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") PDS2018-ER-18-22-001 and all

13 related approvals ("Project Approvals") for the JVR Energy Park ("Project"), an enormous solar energy

14 project roughly one square mile in size that would partially surround, visually dominate, potentially

15 dewater and profoundly and adversely impact Jacumba, a remote, poor and rural village in eastern San
16 Diego County whose community, economy and quality of life stem from and are based primarily on its

17 extraordinary natural beauty, serenity and enjoyment by residents and visitors alike of its historic and

18 culturally significant hot springs.

19 2. The Project would diminish or destroy all of these natural amenities, effectively pulling
20 the historic, cultural, aesthetic, economic and spiritual rug out from underneath this tiny village. Worse,

21 many of these impacts are unnecessary, because far less acreage is needed than claimed by the developer

22 to generate the target energy production of 90 megawatts ("MW"). The County's own documents reveal
23 that technological improvements since this Project was originally proposed enable the use of double-

24 sided solar panels that receive sunlight on both sides of the panel, increasing efficiency by about 40

25 percent. Despite this indisputable reduction in the acreage needed to achieve the developer's financial

26 objectives, the County arbitrarily approved a needlessly destructive Project, turning CEQA on its head.

27 3. Petitioners seek this Court's declaration that the Board's actions violate

28 CEQA, the County General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, and the Planning and Zoning Law, and this

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 2 -

- Court's writ of mandate ordering the County to set aside and vacate its Project Approvals. Finally,
2 petitioners seek an injunction forbidding all activity on the Project that could result in any change or

3

4 alteration in the physical environment until the Board has taken all actions necessary to bring the Project

5 and the Board's Project Approvals - into compliance with CEQA, the General Plan and Zoning
Ordinance, and the Planning and Zoning Law.

6 VENUE AND JURISDICTION

7 4.

8 This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP")
sections 526 (injunctive relief), 1060 (declaratory relief), 1085 (traditional mandate) and 1094.5
9 (administrative mandate), PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5 (judicial review under CEQA), Government

10

11 Code section 65009(c)(1) (judicial review under the Planning and Zoning Law), and Article VI, section
10, of the California Constitution.

12 5.

13 Venue is proper pursuant to CCP sections 393(b) (actions against public officers) and 395

14 (actions generally) because the Board is the legislative body for and has its office within San Diego
County. This petition is timely filed within all applicable statutes of limitations.

15 6.

16 This action is timely under CEQA because it is filed within 30 days of the Board's posting

17 of its Notice of Determination ("NOD") with the San Diego County Clerk (PRC § 21167(b)) on August

18 20, 2021 as extended by CCP sections 12 and 12a, and timely under the Government Code because it is

19 filed and served within 90 days of the Board's approval of the Project on August 18, 2021 (Govt. Code
§§ 65009(c)(1)).

20 7.

21 a copy Pursuant to CCP section 388, petitioners are serving the California Attorney General with

22 of this Verified Petition and Complaint, and consistent with PRC section 21167.5, petitioners

have served the Board with notice of this suit.

23 PARTIES

24 8.

25 Petitioner SAVE JACUMBA is an unincorporated association of concerned citizens

26 residing in the remote rural village of Jacumba in eastern San Diego County who will be directly harmed

27 by the Project. Save Jacumba and its members are vitally interested in proper land use planning and

28 management in order to maintain and enhance the area's ecological integrity, scenic beauty, wildlife,
recreational amenities and natural resources, and protect its residents and visitors from health hazards.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 3 -

1 Their small community of Jacumba is home to many particularly vulnerable communities including
2 poor, elderly, minority and medically at-risk residents who are especially sensitive to the Project's

3 adverse social, economic and health effects. Save Jacuma's members reside in and near Jacumba and

4 respectfully use and enjoy on a sustainable basis the area's natural resources, including naturally heated

5 ground and surface waters, for aesthetic, scientific, historic, cultural, recreational, and spiritual
6 enjoyment. Construction and operation of the Project threaten to harm the quiet use and enjoyment of

7 the area's unique and vulnerable public resources by Save Jacumba's members and the public at large.

8 9. The Project and its associated energy infrastructure including high tension power lines

9 threaten to cause harm to Save Jacumba's members and other nearby residents by degrading and

10 destroying the area's extraordinary visual resources, bulldozing and obliterating over 600 acres of

11 wildlife habitat, consuming and potentially dewatering the area's groundwater resources, erecting a vast
12 array of reflective surfaces that pose a significant hazard to aviation and mislead migratory birds into

13 crashing onto what they perceive to be a lake, creating a high risk of wildfire in an arid, windy and

14 wildfire-prone region, impeding wildfire suppression by installing electrified facilities that would block

15 and impede wildfire response, exacerbating flash flood risks by constructing massive berms in flood
16 hazard zones that would redirect flood waters into adjacent residential areas, and constructing a huge

17 swath of highly reflective and intrusive solar panels that would replace the area's existing scenic

18 wonderland with an ugly and depressing industrial landscape. As citizens who own, use and/or enjoy the
19 bountiful natural resources in the Project area, Save Jacumba's members have a clear and present right
20 to, and direct beneficial interest in, the performance by the Board of its public duty to comply with the

21 provisions of CEQA, the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, and the Planning and Zoning Law. Waste
22 Management of Alameda County v. County of Alameda (*Waste Management of Alameda County")

23 (2000) 79 Cal.App.4th 1223, 1233-1239. Save Jacumba was duly authorized to and does bring this
24 action in a representative capacity on behalf of its members.

25 10. Petitioner WE ARE HUMAN KIND, LLC ("Human Kind") is the owner of the Jacumba

26 Hot Springs Resort, a unique destination resort that provides its guest with safe and healthful access to

27 and enjoyment of therapeutic mineral springs in Jacumba. Human Kind provides physical therapy and

28 spiritual rejuvenation in a natural, rustic and tranquil setting. Construction and operation of the Project

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 4 -

1 threatens to harm Human Kind's ability to continue to provide its guests with a serene setting and
2 reliable access to consistently hot spring waters. Human Kind therefore has a clear and present right to,

3 and beneficial interest in, the performance by the Board of its public duty to comply with the provisions

4 of the County General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, the Planning and Zoning Law, and CEQA. Waste
5 Management of Alameda County, 79 Cal.App.4th at 1233-1239.

6 11. Petitioner a JEFFREY OSBORNE is a resident of Jacumba and a partner and manager of

7 Human Kind. Mr. Osborne is vitally interested in protecting and restoring the historic resort village of
8 Jacumba and its commercial heart, the Jacumba Hot Springs Resort, to achieve a vibrant, diverse,

9 culturally enriched, aesthetically enhanced, environmentally safe and economically self-sufficient

10 community.

11 12. Petitioners have authorized their attorney to file this lawsuit on their behalf to vindicate
12 their, and the public's, vital interest in securing the Board's compliance with the CEQA, the County

13 General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, and the Planning and Zoning Law, in connection with its review

14 and approval of the Project.

15 13. Respondent SAN DIEGO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS at all material times
16 has been and is the governing legislative body of San Diego County and is authorized and required by

17 the California Constitution to regulate land use within all unincorporated areas of the County, including
18 the Project site, in compliance with CEQA, the County General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, and the

19 Planning and Zoning Law. The Board is the lead agency for the Project under CEQA. The Board issued
20 the Project Approvals on August 18, 2021. The Board filed its CEQA Notice of Determination ("NOD")

21 for the Project with the San Diego County Clerk on August 20, 2021.

22 14. The true names and capacities of respondents DOES 1-100, inclusive, are unknown to

23 petitioners who therefore sue such respondents by fictitious names pursuant to CCP section 474.

24 Petitioners will, with leave of Court if necessary, amend this verified petition when the true names and

25 capacities of said DOE respondents have been ascertained.

26 15. Real party in interest JVR ENERGY PARK, LLC is a Delaware domestic limited liability

27 company, which incorporated on December 18, 2017 (File Number 201735710049) and registered in

28 California on December 18, 2017 (Entity Number 21-C61566). Petitioners are informed and believe that

2 its office address is either 17901 Von Karman Avenue, Suite 1050, Irvine California 92614 (the address

3 shown on the County's NOD) or 18575 Jamboree Rd., Suite 850, Irvine, California 92612 (the address

4 shown on the California Secretary of State's website). Its registered agent for service of process in
California is CT Corporation System, whose registered address is 330 N. Brand Blvd., Suite 700,
5 Glendale, California 91203. JVR ENERGY PARK, LLC is the Project proponent and developer, and
6 according to the County's NOD, the sole applicant for the Project Approvals.

7 16.

8 Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of real parties in interest DOES

9 101-200, inclusive, and therefore sue such real parties in interest herein by fictitious names. Petitioners

10 are informed and believe, and based upon such information and belief allege, that the fictitiously named

11 real parties are entities or individuals who have a direct and substantial economic interest in, or are the
recipients of, the Board's Project Approvals. When the true identities and capacities of these real parties
12 have been ascertained, petitioners will, with leave of the Court if necessary, amend this verified petition

13 to insert such identities and capacities.

14 HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

15 17.

16 As approved by the San Diego County Board of Supervisors on August 18, 2021, the JVR

17 Energy Park Project in Jacumba, California would include (1) the grading, leveling and fencing of five

18 parcels aggregating approximately one-square mile within a 1,356-acre site on the eastern boundary of
the Village of Jacumba, (2) the installation of approximately 291,000 single-axis, double-sided
19 photovoltaic solar panels or modules up to 12-feet high and expected to have a power capacity of 90
20 megawatts (MW), (3) the installation of a 90 MW battery energy storage system, (3) the installation of
21 inverter/transformer platforms, (4) the installation of an underground electrical collection system, (5) the

22

23 installation of a collector substation, (6) the installation of a switchyard, (7) the installation of an

24 overhead gen-tie line, (8) the installation of several miles of security fencing, (8) the installation of five

25 steel poles ranging from 70 to 115 feet in height, and (9) the construction of internal vehicular access
ways throughout these facilities.

26 18.

27 The Jacumba area is blessed with a world-class upwelling of natural mineral hot springs

28 that have long been recognized as one of California's outstanding natural resources. It provides both
therapeutic healing for those with special medical and spiritual needs, and recreational opportunities for

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 6 -

1 local residents and visitors alike. Beginning over a century ago, this extraordinary hot springs combined

2 with untrammeled vistas of stunning mountain and desert landscapes, pristine mountain air, abundant

3 wildlife and a quiet, remote and serene setting fostered the growth of one of the region's finest

4 destination resorts. To enable increased public enjoyment of this unique natural phenomenon, in 1919

5 rail service was completed between Jacumba Hot Springs and the City of San Diego. The resulting
6 increased visitation led to the construction of a premier hotel, the Hotel Jacumba, in 1925. By the 1930s

7 Jacumba a grew to a population of more than 5,000, ten times its current size. Jacumba remained a highly

8 desirable and treasured regional destination for several decades.

9 19. Following World War II, increased competition from hot springs in Murrieta and Palm

10 Springs combined with dwindling visitation to the Salton Sea and the construction of Interstate 8 two

11 miles north of the Old Highway 80 (which had brought visitors directly into Jacumba) resulted in

12 decreased tourism in the area and ultimately the closure of many of Jacumba's formerly thriving roadside

13 businesses, including the Hotel Jacumba, which closed in 1985. In 1986, in response to strong local

14 support for restoration of Jacumba's illustrious past success as a regional destination resort, San Diego

15 County adopted Specific Planning Area that covered most of the 1,356-acre Project site, a designation
16 that envisioned development of a variety of uses to revitalize Jacumba. Notably, that designation did not

17 allow preemptive development of the site by a mammoth, industrial-scale solar energy development.

18 20. At the same time that Jacumba residents were awakening to the potential for revitalization

19 of their community and its potential rebirth as a destination resort, advances in technology and
20 economies of scale have propelled the advent of economical roof-top solar panels coupled with battery

21 storage units. This evolution in the efficient local generation and delivery of energy does not just
22 provide power directly and economically to the consumer. Equally important, it eliminates reliance on

23 remote, industrial-scale energy projects and their associated long-distance transmission lines and
24 cascading and often catastrophic environmental impacts. Those impacts include degraded scenery, loss

25 of habitat and heightened risk of wildfires in arid, wind-swept rural regions such as eastern San Diego

26 County. The Project needlessly adds to this wildfire hazard and undermines ongoing efforts to increase

27 the installation of roof-top solar in the urban areas where energy is most needed.

28 21. In recognition of the local community's desire for protection and enhancement of their

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 7 -

1 extraordinary natural amenities to achieve economic self-sufficiency and long-term stability as a rural

2 village, the San Diego County General Plan places 1,307 acres of the site within the Village Regional

3 Category. The remaining easternmost 38 acres of the site are located within the Rural Lands Regional

4 Category.

5 22. In 1986 San Diego County approved a General Plan Amendment which designated most

6 of the 1,356-acre Project site as Specific Plan Area with the goal of generating renewed interest in the

7 Jacumba Hot Springs area by providing regionally attractive recreational opportunities, as well as
8 housing, facilities and services for both residents and visitors. The Specific Plan Area designation is

9 applied to areas that require the preparation and adoption of a comprehensive Specific Plan. According

10 to the County Planning Commission, "[a] Specific Plan envisions a multi-use concept that may contain

11 residential, commercial, industrial, public institutional and open space uses." San Diego County

12 Planning Commission Hearing Report for the Project dated July 9, 2021, at 3-8.

13 23. San Diego County published its NOP for the Project on March 7, 2019, and its Draft
14 Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") on October 8, 2020. Reflecting the growing widespread public
15 opposition to the Project, scores of written and oral comments were submitted by local community
16 residents including members of Save Jacumba objecting to the Project and requesting consideration of

17 alternatives ranging from rooftop solar to relocation and downsizing of the Project.

18 24. In an abrupt about-face that thwarted full disclosure and public understanding of the

19 Project's long-term environmental impacts, after assuring the public in its NOP that the Project would
20 require a General Plan Amendment and Rezone, the County abruptly dropped those requirements when it

21 released its DEIR. The County had initially maintained, correctly, that "[t]he Project originally included

22 a General Plan Amendment, Rezone, and Major Use Permit (MUP) for an up to 90MW energy [sic]

23 solar energy generation and storage facility as described in the Notice of Preparation (NOP) for the EIR.'

24 Id. at 3-3. But "[s]ubsequent to the NOP public review period," all that changed. Id. Rather than

25 provide the full analysis of the Project's long-term impacts as applicable law requires, the County
26 claimed in releasing its DEIR that "the General Plan Amendment and Rezone applications were

27 determined [to] not be needed, and therefore subsequently withdrawn." Id. The Planning Commission

28 stated:

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 8 -

H

2 "[f]or purposes of the environmental review under CEQA, the Project is considered an interim use rather than a permanent use in the EIR because the solar facility will be required to provide :

3 bonded agreement to ensure decommissioning and will be conditioned to remove all of its components after its operational use. ... Since the Project is considered an interim use, it is

4 allowed in the Specific Planning Area Land Use Designation upon approval of an MUP and a General Plan Amendment and Rezone are not required. Therefore, the Project in the Draft EIR only included an MUP.'

5 Id. (emphasis added).

6 25.

7 In particular, the Planning Commission asserted that "[p]ursuant to Section 2888(a) of the
County Zoning Ordinance, a [sic] MUP may be granted on this site for any use pursuant to a bonded

8 agreement,

9 such as a decommissioning plan, that ensures the removal of all structures and associated
electrical components within a specified amount of time ...." Id. (emphasis added). Based solely on
10 this provision of its Zoning Ordinance, the County effectively sought to bypass the requirement for a

11 General Plan Amendment that is imbedded in the fundamental hierarchy of California's Planning and
12 Zoning law. As a general law jurisdiction, San Diego County's planning, zoning and permitting

13

14 decisions must comply with the state Planning and Zoning Law (Government Code section 65000 et

15 seq.). That means that the County may not evade its duties under its General Plan by relying on contrary
provisions of its Zoning Ordinance. As elucidated in a landmark ruling that has been settled law for
16 nearly four decades:

17

18 To view them in order: a use permit is struck from the mold of the zoning law ([Government Code section] 65901); the zoning law must comply with the adopted general plan (§ 65860); the

19 adopted general plan must conform with state law (§§ 65300, 65302). The validity of the permit process derives from compliance with this hierarchy of planning laws. These laws delimit the

20 authority of the permit issuing agency to act and establish the measure of a valid permit. A
permit action taken without compliance with the hierarchy of land use laws is ultra vires as to any defect implicated by the uses sought by the permit.

21

22 Neighborhood Action Group v. County of Calaveras (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 1176, 1184 (emphasis

23 added); accord, Government Code section 65860(a) ("County or city zoning ordinances shall be
consistent with the general plan of the county or city by January 1, 1974.").

24 26.

25 This reformulation of the scope and depth of the environmental and planning review
required for this Project sidestepped all analysis of the Project's long-term impacts. Suddenly, based on
26 this recasting of the Project as merely a "temporary use,' a the County thought - mistakenly - that it was

27

28 able to end run the contrary requirements of both the Planning and Zoning Law and CEQA.

27. The Project would preclude restoration of Jacumba's once-thriving local economy and

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 9 -

1 community in several ways. First, it would remove all remaining dairy and ranch structures from the

2 site's historically productive farmland. Second, it would preempt the site's development for uses

3 compatible with revitalization of Jacumba as a self-sufficient community that protect, enhance and

4 promote its natural scenery, wildlife habitat, hot springs, and recreational opportunities by walling it off.

5 Third, it would instead bulldoze, de-vegetate, and enclose within a high security fence the site's former

6 agricultural and adjacent lands with an ugly, hazardous and wildlife-intolerant industrial landscape.

7 28. Despite overwhelming opposition to this Project from Jacumba's residents who are

8 directly impacted by its approval, on July 9, 2021 the San Diego County Planning Commission brushed

9 aside the wishes of the local community and voted 5 to 2 to approve the Project. On August 18, 2021,

10 the Board of Supervisors likewise ignored the pleas of dozens of community members who traveled to

11 San Diego to express their concerns and informed opposition to the Project, and voted to issue the

12 Project Approvals. The Board then filed its NOD with the San Diego County Clerk on August 20, 2021.

13 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

14 29. The Project will permanently alter future development of the Jacumba Valley,
15 transforming it from an extraordinary scenic treasure that has drawn visitors from throughout the world

16 to enjoy its healing mineral waters and serene bucolic splendor, into an ugly, foreboding, industrial

17 eyesore. The Project's industrialization of a fertile plain with abundant wildlife and stunning vistas of

18 surrounding and still largely unspoiled mountain ranges conflicts profoundly with the County General

19 Plan's reservation of this unique rural site for a comprehensively planned community that would
20 implement the Jacumba community's consistently expressed desire for a small-scale, self-sufficient,
21 environmentally-friendly village seeking to restore its previous success as a regional destination resort.

22 30. The Project's impacts on wildlife are significant, and yet inadequately examined and

23 mitigated. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW") timely advised the County in

24 writing of "a number of shortcomings in the Project's approach" including the County's failure to abide

25 by its "Planning Agreement .. signed at the end of 2020 between the County, CDFW and [the United

26 States Fish and Wildlife Service] regarding review of interim projects while preparing the North and

27 East County NCCP/HCP [Natural Community Conservation Planning/Habitat Conservation Plan]

28 Plans." Letter from CDFW to San Diego County dated August 18, 2021 at p. 1. As CDFW explained, it

1 "had recommended that focused surveys be performed for any and all California species of Special

2 Concern (SSC) that may be present on the Project site." Id. CDFW pointed out that the County had not

3 conducted the surveys, nor provided the mitigation measures required under that agreement for several

4 species of concern that are either known to inhabit, or that may inhabit, the Project site, including the

5 tricolored blackbird, a California Threatened Species, golden eagle, burrowing owl, northern harrier,
6 yellow-headed blackbird, San Diego black-tailed jackrabbit, and the federally endangered Quino
7 checkerspot butterfly. Id. at pp. 1-3.

8 31. For example, the Project would destroy at least 593 acres of potential foraging habitat for

9 the tricolored blackbird. Letter from CDFW to San Diego County dated December 7, 2020 at p. 7. Yet

10 the FEIR claims this impact is "insignificant," based on the premise that other habitat would remain in

11 the area. This premise ignores the fact that the most common reason a species such as the tricolored
12 blackbird becomes imperiled is loss of habitat, and thus any substantial reduction in habitat is a

13 significant impact on the species. The loss of nearly 600 acres of habitat is plainly substantial.

14 32. For a second example, the Project would result in the permanent loss of 96 acres of desert

15 saltbrush scrub, which provides habitat for numerous special status plant and wildlife species. Id. at p. 2.

16 This loss is not reduced by the Project's placement of 100 acres of similar habitat in an offsite open

17 space easement, since there is still a net loss of nearly 100 acres of this habitat.

18 33. For third example, according to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (*FWS"),

19 "[s]everal utility-scale solar projects in the Mojave Desert have reported significant avian mortalities,
20| including waterbirds." Email from FWS to San Diego County dated December 7, 2020 at p. 1. This is

21 primarily due to the "pseudo-lake" effect of solar energy projects whose large solar panel arrays appear

22 to be a water surface to migratory bird species, who attempt to land or forage on what they perceive to be

23 a lake and suffer "immediate death due to fatal blunt trauma" or in the case of waterfowl, even if they

24 land safely, they are unable to take off and "succumb to heat exhaustion" stranded on the hot surface of

25 the solar panels, which the FEIR admits can reach temperatures of 158 degrees Fahrenheit. Id. at

26 attached report to FWS at p. 8; FEIR Global Response GR-2 at p. 1.

27 34. The Project threatens to impede wildlife connectivity between the adjacent Anza-Borrego

28 Desert State Park Wilderness to the north and the mountainous wildlands of Mexico to the south, and

survival. Letter from California Department of Parks and Recreation to San Diego County dated
3 December 7, 2020 at p. 3.

4 35.

5 The Project's impacts on cultural resources are likewise significant and yet inadequately
studied and mitigated. For example, the Manzanita Band of the Kumeyaay Nation, a federally-
6 recognized Self-Governance Indian Tribe, timely objected in writing to the Project on August 17, 2021.

7

8 It pointed out that "Jacumba Valley (Jacume/Hametaay) is a village site extending from its center near

9 the Jacumba Hot Springs several miles in all directions, including the project area . Jacumba Valley

10 is the central location of a Kumeyaay origin story," and includes "several types of important resources

11 such as village sites, sacred area, and plant gathering locales, trails, ceremonial sites, cremation, burials,

12 and other significant resources .. . ." Letter from Manzanita Band of the Kumeyaay Nation to San Diego

13 County dated August 17, 2021, at pp. 1-2. The Manzanita Band objected that "[t]he County has not fully

14 and meaningfully conducted adequate government-to-government consultation" with the Tribe. Id. Due

15 in part to the County's failure to engage in adequate consultation, its environmental review of the

16 Project's impacts on cultural resources is woefully deficient. The Manzanita Band objected, for
example, that:

17

18 "The EIR contains no consideration of the cumulative effects on this area and these sites. Cultural resources are non-renewable resources, and destroying any of them is erasing our history.

19 We are very concerned about the research and information used by [the consultant that prepared

20 the EIR] to [r]each their conclusions in favor of the developer rather than the protection of cultural resources."

21

22 It is our firm belief that the EIR is severely technically flawed, inadequate to approve the projects,

23 and heavily weighted in support of the developer[']s proposal. ... Not only are real and potential impacts to cultural resources amnd tribal cultural resources minimized, their analysis is segmented to further reduce and negate any impacts.'

24 Id. at pp. 2-3.

25 36. The Project's impacts on agricultural resources are similarly significant and yet
26 inadequately studied and mitigated. For example, the Project would destroy 275 acres of Prime

27

28 Farmland, 143.4 acres of Farmland of Statewide Importance, 4.3 acres of Unique Farmland, and 35.3
acres of Farmland of Local Importance, as designated by the California Department of Conservation.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint
for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees 12 -

1 The Project site has been used for dairy farming since at least 1918, and more than one-third of the

2 Project site has soil that supports irrigated cropland. The evidence of the Project site's past farming use

3 and substantial acreage of farmland of both local and statewide importance as measured by the California

4 Department of Conservation is indisputable. Yet the FEIR asserts that the Project's elimination of

5 farming on this site for at least the duration of the Project, and the Project's conversion of the site's

6 extensive acreage of high quality farmland are not significant impacts, and based on this plainly

7 erroneous premise, fails to provide the mitigation that is required to avoid or reduce these significant
8 impacts.

9 37. The Project's impacts on aesthetic resources are immense and undeniable. They include

10 massive industrial development adjacent to the County's designated scenic highway, Old Highway 80,

11 which the Project crowds on both sides for nearly one mile. The County's applicable Subregional Plan
12 includes the goal of establishing a network of scenic highway corridors within which scenic, historical

13 and recreational resources are not only protected but enhanced, and Old Highway 80 is one of the named

14 scenic highway corridors protected by that goal. The FEIR admits that "Old Highway 80, which

15 parallels the Project site for approximately 1 mile, is also included in the County Scenic Highway

16 System (County of San Diego 2011a)," FEIR at 2.1-8, and "Old Highway 80 is a designated California

17 State Historic Route. In 2006, the state legislature granted this designation in recognition of the

18 highway's 'outstanding natural, cultural, historic and scenic qualities." FEIR at 2.1-13. The FEIR also

19 concedes, as it must, that the Project would have significant impacts on those traveling down Old
20 Highway 80 or who live near it. Id.

21 38. And yet, despite this concession, the FEIR arbitrarily concludes that the Project is
22 consistent with the Subregional Plan's policy of protecting and enhancing the very corridor it admits the

23 Project significantly degrades because "there are no current local regulations governing development of

24 lands along I-8 or Old Highway 80." Id. But the Subregional Plan does not state that it is only when the

25 designated corridors are also governed by some other regulations that the goal applies. Equally
26 illogically, the FEIR attempts to justify its conclusion that having a significant visual impact on views
27 along : State-designated scenic highway corridor is nonetheless consistent with the Scenic Highways

28 Goal of protecting and enhancing these highways by arguing the County could still establish and

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint
for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees 13 -

1 designate Old Highway 80 as a scenic highway, even though the views which make it scenic would be

2 gone. FEIR at p. 2.1-73, Table 2.1. To the contrary, destroying the scenic resource that prompted

3 designation of a scenic highway obviously destroys as well the reason for designating it. Moreover, the

4 FEIR ignores the County's duty to comply with its Subregional Plan goal to protect and enhance this

5 designated scenic highway. The FEIR's claim that the Project is consistent with the Scenic Highways

6 Goal of the Subregional Plan is plainly contrary to fact and irrational.

7 39. The Project's impacts on public safety due to its dramatically increased wildfire hazards

8 are likewise significant and yet inadequately studied and mitigated. Letter from Boulevard Planning
9 Group ("BPG") to San Diego County dated April 7, 2019 (and attached to BPG's letter dated December

10 7, 2020) at p. 5. Solar energy projects cause a "significant increase in wild fire ignition sources and fire-
11 fighting impediments/hazards." Id. This Project "has the potential to ignite wildfires through attraction
12 of lightning strikes and/or through electrical faults or other malfunctions in project components . . ..

13 Battery storage represents additional sources of wildfire ignition and hazardous/toxic fumes generated by

14 burning lithium ion batteries and thermal runaway events." Id. at p. 24.

15 40. Not only do photovoltaic energy projects create thousands of electrical connections that
16 transfer enormous quantities of electrical energy in hot, arid areas prone to wildfire ignition, they also

17 impede the suppression of wildfires that occur near or within these high energy fields. For example,

18 "[f]ire fighters will need to wait for a fire to burn out of the project area to avoid potential electrical/toxic
19 fumes/hazards, thereby allowing a fire to potentially increase in size o[r] blow out of control." Id. at p.
20 5. Two of San Diego County's most destructive wildfires over the past 20 years - the Witch and Pines
21 fires - were caused by power lines in remote rural areas. According to the California Department of
22 Forestry and Fire Protection ("CalFire"), at least 29 fires over 10 acres in size have occurred during the

23 past five decades in the extremely high fire hazard zone in which Jacumba is located.

24 41. The Project's impacts on groundwater are likewise potentially significant and yet

25 inadequately studied and mitigated. Groundwater is the exclusive source of water for residential,
26 agricultural, and commercial uses in the Jacumba Valley. Yet in listing the uses in the Project area that

27 rely upon the local purveyor of groundwater, the Jacumba Community Services District ("JCSD"), the

28 FEIR omits entirely the Jacumba Hot Springs Resort, which like all the other uses in the area, is solely

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 14 -

1 dependent on JCSD for the water that serves its resort and its visitors. Although local residents have

2 experienced sharply fluctuating groundwater levels in recent decades as global warming increases
3 temperatures and decreases precipitation, no groundwater management agency oversees groundwater

4 management in the Jacumba Valley Groundwater Basin on which Jacumba Hot Springs Resort, Jacumba
5 residents, other Jacumba businesses, and if approved the Project would as well, rely. The absence of any

6 regulatory authority to assure that groundwater pumping for existing and future uses is managed is properly
7 heightens the need for careful and comprehensive examination of the Project's impacts on the Jacumba

8 Valley's essential but vulnerable groundwater supplies. But rather than provide the information vitally

9 needed by the public to evaluate the Project's impacts on groundwater particularly during construction,

10 the FEIR glosses over the potential for shortfalls by providing only a gross estimate of total aquifer

11 storage in the area and dismissing impacts on water availability on the asserted grounds that construction

12 of the Project would use only 1.6 percent of that estimated total storage. FEIR at p. 2.7-35.

13 42. The Project's impacts on the adjacent community of Jacumba are similarly significant and

14 yet inadequately studied and mitigated. The Project as approved would needlessly occupy over 600 acres

15 of land, more than six times the area occupied by the adjacent, existing community of Jacumba roughly

16 100 acres. The Project proponent insisted throughout the approval process that it required at least 600

17 acres for its solar modules to generate what it characterized as its financial bottom line: a sustained

18 generation level of 90 MW.

19 43. But careful review of the developer's representations - on which the County uncritically

20 relied - reveals that far less acreage was in fact required to generate the target electrical output. Other

21 similar solar energy projects require far less acreage to generate comparable levels of energy. For

22 example, the Viking Energy Solar Project in nearby Imperial County generates 150 MW on just 604

23 acres - a ratio of 4 MW per acre. The Aramis Solar Project in the Livermore Valley generates 100 MW

24 on just 410 acres- a ratio of 4.1 MW per acre. Applying these ratios yields an acreage required to

25 generate the developer's desired 90 MW of just 360 to 375 acres (4 MW/acre times 90 MW = 360

26 acres).

27 44. Using the County's own figures likewise confirms this to be the case. According to the

28 FEIR Appendix V, and the Planning Commission's July 9, 2021 Hearing Report at page 3-3, this Project

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees 15 -

1 uses 540-watt photovoltaic panels. Multiplying the 291,000 panels approved by the County times 540

2 watts yields 157,140 watts, or 157 MW direct current ("DC") capacity. Appendix V, Table 1 incorrectly

3 states that the resulting DC capacity is between 110 MW and 115 MW, a plain arithmetic error.

4 Converting this direct current energy into alternating current (*AC") typically requires about 1.25 watts

5 of DC current to yield 1 watt of AC current. Letter from ZGlobal to San Diego County dated August 17,

6 2021 at p. 1. Dividing 157,140 MW by this 1.25/1.00 ratio yields an AC current capacity of 125,712

7 watts, or 125 MW. Thus, the developer's stated number of solar panels - 291,000 - times the stated

8 wattage capacity of each panel - 540 - yields an AC current capacity of 125 MW, far more than the 90
9 MW target.

10 45. To derive the number of 540-watt panels needed to generate the target generation of 90

11 MW, one simply multiplies 90 MW times the same 1.25 ratio to calculate the AC current equivalent,

12 112.5 MW, and then divide by 540 watts to yield the number of panels needed, 208,600. Id. at p. 3.

13 Thus, this Project requires only about 208,600 panels, not 291,000 panels, to produce the target
14 generation of 90 MW.

15 46. Converting this reduced number of needed panels - 208,600 - into the reduced acreage
16 required to support them is likewise a simple mathematical calculation. Id. at p. 5, Table 2. Instead of a

17 need for more than 600 acres as the developer erroneously claimed and the County mistakenly accepted,

18 and allowing for all the clearances and dimensions claimed by the developer, only 396 acres are actually

19 needed to produce the target generation of 90 MW. Id. Adding in a "security factor " of 20% yields a
20 maximum acreage needed of just 475 acres, not the more than 600 acres claimed by the developer and

21 approved by the County.

22 47. In effect, the County was hoodwinked into approving development of a much larger

23 acreage than was actually needed to produce the target generation of 90 MW. This is a critical error, a
24 because the County relied on the developer's contrary representations to reject consideration of far less

25 impactful alternatives that would dramatically reduce the acreage required for this Project. A much
26 smaller footprint would allow much greater setbacks from the Village of Jacumba, vastly reducing the

27 Project's adverse environmental impacts.

28 48. The Project's claimed reductions in emissions compared to fossil-fuel-powered energy

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint
for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees 16 -

1 sources are likewise exaggerated. This is So because they overlook three salient facts. First, the

2 alternative of generating comparable electricity with roof-top (and similar urban solar sources utilizing

3 existing buildings or structures such as parking garage roofs) yields greater power at less cost because it

4 avoids the tremendous loss of power that occurs when it is transmitted over long distances as is the case

5 with this Project.

6 49. Second, the FEIR ignores the massive greenhouse emissions that result from wildfires

7 caused by power line ignitions. Many of the worst wildfires in California history such as the Witch and

8 Pines fires in San Diego County, the Camp Fire in Butte County that incinerated the town of Paradise,

9 and most of the fires that scorched hundreds of thousands of acres in Sonoma and Napa counties during

10 the past two decades were caused by power lines in rural areas. The carbon emissions from these fires

11 caused smoky skies over much of North America for weeks, dwarfing the life-time emission reductions
12 claimed for the Project. Yet the FEIR ignores this fatal flaw in its greenhouse gas emission calculations.

13 50. Third, the FEIR also fails to calculate the lifecycle emissions of the Project, which include

14 not just emissions associated with Project construction and operation, but also the manufacturing and

15 transporting of the Project components, and the decommissioning of the Project and attempted
16 restoration of the Project site.

17 51. The Project places a high energy electrical generation and storage facility nearly one

18 square mile in size in the middle of an historical flood plain in which the FEIR admits flood heights

19 could reach six feet, substantially higher than the 4.5-foot high (and erodible) berms on which solar

20 equipment would be placed. FEIR at p. 2.7-6. The Jacumba Valley flooded as recently as the summer of

21 2014 on the Project site. Yet the FEIR erroneously asserts that the Project is not located within a 100-

22 year floodplain or other special flood hazard area. FEIR at p. 2.7-41. The FEIR inconsistently states that

23 the Federal Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA") has not analyzed the project as a flood hazard

24 but then states that this analysis should be done before approval of a grading plan, squarely placing the

25 approval cart before the analysis horse. FEIR at p. 3.1.8-9.

26 52. The Project locates solar arrays on three sides of the Jacumba Airport runway, within the

27 striking range of glider winch/towing cables that may be jettisoned during emergency situations, and

28 counts the narrow corridors between solar arrays in claiming that planes in distress have room to land in

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 17 -

H

2 the solar arrays. The absurdity of placing an electrical facility posing an extreme fire hazard next to and

3 at the end of an airport runway is heightened by the fact that this airport is frequently used by gliders,

4 that require for take-off a winched cable that may be jettisoned over the solar arrays, and that require
repeated circling to determine wind speed and direction before landing, resulting in flight paths that are
5 unpredictable and impossible to conform to the Project's solar arrays, which are fixed in a north-south
6 configuration that conflicts with the east-west orientation of the most common flight paths.

7 53.

8 The Project would have a detrimental "heat island" effect in which ambient air

9 temperatures are raised significantly due to the fact that the solar panels would attract and hold heat from

10 the sun, reaching surface temperatures as high as 158 degrees Fahrenheit. Email from FWS to San

11 Diego County dated December 7, 2020, attached report at p. 8.

54. The Project allows land use admittedly inconsistent with the County General Plan and
12 Zoning on the false premise that it is merely a "temporary" rather than permanent use, ignoring the facts

13

14 that first, the Project creates potentially unstoppable momentum in favor of renewing the Project's 35-

15 year ostensible permit life (or simply replacing this facility with an upgraded version of itself), and
second, this 35-year duration would outlive most of the current residents of Jacumba. The FEIR admits
16 that the Project is not consistent with the Zoning Ordinance, stating that "[a]fter decommissioning, the

17

18 land would have to return to a land use that is consistent with the County of San Diego zoning ordinance
at the time of decommissioning." Id. at p. 1-21. Confirming its pre-ordained permanence, the Project
19 includes a large Switchyard that will be turned over to San Diego Gas & Electric ("SDG&E") after its
20 construction, establishing an industrial-scale renewable energy utility within Jacumba's rural village

21

22 boundary in perpetuity that will invite, if not mandate, the continued operation of the Project long after

23 its ostensible 35-year permit life. The County planning staff admitted in their Hearing Report dated
August 6, 2021 that before its permit expires, the applicant could apply for and receive approval of an
24 MUP modification to authorize continued use of the site as a solar facility. Id. at p. 3-15.

25 55. The Project needlessly uses 75 shipping-container-sized potentially flammable lithium

26 batteries that are

27 prone to runaway fires and contain toxic materials rather than the iron-flow batteries

28 currently in use at the SDG&E I MW solar facility in Campo. The FEIR admits that because of their
toxicity and difficulty in extinguishing, should they catch fire the County "would let the batteries burn in

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint
for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees 18 -

1 place." Id. at p. 2.6-47. In July 2021, the flames that resulted from large lithium-ion battery explosion

2 in Australia took three days to be extinguished. Given that the prevailing winds in the Project area are

3 frequently from the east toward the village, toxic fumes from burning batteries would drift toward

4 residences and endanger the health of their occupants.

5 56. The Project approves an 8.1-acre Switchyard Facilities ("Switchyard") that is completely
6 unnecessary, as it duplicates an existing switchyard located less than three miles to the east at the East

7 County ("ECO") Substation. Letter from ZGlobal to San Diego County dated August 17, 2021 at p. 7.

8 This new Switchyard will upon completion be transferred to SDG&E and be removed from County
9 jurisdiction, as regulatory control will then shift to the California Public Utilities Commission

10 ("CPUC"), effectively creating a permanent industrial facility whose sole purpose is to transfer electric

11 energy from new industrial-scale energy projects in the middle of the Jacumba Valley, refuting the

12 County's disclaimer that the approved Project is a mere "temporary use," and divesting the impacted

13 residents of Jacumba of any direct land use control over this use.

14 57. The Project is not needed to meet state and local climate action goals as there are already

15 many less impactful renewable energy projects in the existing approval pipeline, including six projects
16 with a combined capacity of 2,918 MW within the general area of the Project that are requesting

17 connection to the existing ECO Substation less than three miles east of the Project site. Letter from

18 ZGlobal to San Diego County dated August 17, 2021 at pp. 2-3.

19 58. The developer prematurely entered into a Power Purchase Agreement ("PPA") with San
20 Diego Community Power to justify its claimed need for a 90 MW facility, in conflict with the DEIR's

21 representation that only a project "up to 90 MW" was sought.

22 59. In sum, the County needlessly approved a Project that will have the following severe
23 adverse impacts on the environment generally and on the Jacumba community specifically:

24 - It would dwarf the adjacent tiny community of Jacumba by leveling, fencing and converting to
25 industrial use an area six times the size of Jacumba, destroying the community's rural, scenic
26 environment and foreclosing future restoration and use of its historic hot springs resort.

27 It would eliminate 275 acres of Prime Farmland, 143.4 acres of Farmland of Statewide

28 Importance, 4.3 acres of Unique Farmland, and 35.3 acres of Farmland of Local Importance, as

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees 19 -

1 designated by the California Department of Conservation.

2 - It would destroy over one square mile of wildlife habitat including habitat vitally needed by

3 several rare and unique species of concern, and prevent future wildlife migration.

4 - It would create a highly intrusive mile-square zone of reflective surfaces visible from miles in

5 all directions from the surrounding mountains including those within the adjacent Anza-Borrego Desert

6 State Park, severely degrading the visitor experience.

7 It would create a source of wildfire ignition and spread in a huge area of East County that a

8 CalFire has classified as a High to Extremely High Wildfire Zone.

9 It would create a enormous attractive nuisance that migratory birds would mistake for a lake,
10 resulting in their injury and death.

11 It would result in the removal of large quantities of groundwater from an overtapped aquifer

12 that is the sole source of potable water for thousands of residents in the surrounding rural communities.

13 - It would place high energy electrical generation and storage facility nearly one square mile in

14 size in the middle of a documented flood plain in which the FEIR admits flood heights could reach six

15 feet, substantially higher than the 4.5-foot high (and erodible) berms on which solar equipment would be

16 placed.

17 - It would place solar arrays on three sides of the Jacumba Airport runway, within the striking

18 range of glider towing cables that may be jettisoned during emergency situations, and counts the narrow

19 corridors between solar arrays in claiming that planes in distress have room to land in the solar arrays.

20 - It allows a land use admittedly inconsistent with the County General Plan and Zoning on the

21 false premise that it is merely a "temporary" rather than permanent use, ignoring the fact that the Project

22 constructs a permanent 8.1-acre high-energy Switchyard and creates potentially unstoppable momentum

23 in favor of renewing the Project's 35-year ostensible permit life, a duration that will outlive most of the

24 current residents of Jacumba.

25 - It would needlessly use 75 shipping-container-sized and potentially flammable lithium
26 batteries that are prone to runaway fires and contain toxic materials rather than the iron-flow batteries

27 currently in use at the SDG&E I MW solar facility in Campo.

28 It needlessly occupies a 604-acre footprint when the County's own documents confirm that only

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 20 -

H about 400 acres are needed to generate the target energy production of 90 MW.

2 -

3 It approves an unnecessary and massive Switchyard that creates needless infrastructure that

4 duplicates an existing switchyard with ample capacity for this Project that is located less than 3 miles

away.

5 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

6 60.

7 Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to the filing of this Verified

8 Petition and, to the extent required, have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies.

61.

9 Petitioners have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law,

10 within the meaning of CCP section 1086. Unless this Court issues a writ of mandate ordering the Board

11 to set aside and vacate its Project Approvals, the health and environmental interests of petitioners and the
public will be substantially and irreparably harmed. No monetary damages or other legal remedy could
12 adequately compensate for the harms to petitioners and the environment that would arise if the Board's

13 unlawful conduct were allowed to stand.

14 62.

15 Petitioners are also entitled to injunctive relief under CCP section 526 because the Project
threatens irreparable environmental harm. Unless enjoined, the Board and the real parties in interest will
16 implement the Project despite its lack of compliance with applicable laws, causing unlawful and

17

18 unnecessary environmental degradation, impacts to public health and safety, and related socio-economic
impacts including impaired property use and enjoyment and diminished property values, to community
19 members. Petitioners would thereby suffer irreparable harm due to the Board's failure to take the steps
20 required by law to adequately protect the environment. Injunctive relief is thus warranted under CCP

21

22 section 525 et seq. and PRC section 21168.9 to prevent irreparable harm to the environment.

63.

23 An actual controversy exists between petitioners and respondents under CCP section
1060. Petitioners contend that respondents have acted in violation of applicable laws, including but not
24 limited to CEQA, the County General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, and the Planning and Zoning Law as

25

26 alleged herein, and must therefore vacate and set aside the Project approvals. Petitioners are informed

27 and believe that respondents dispute this contention. A judicial resolution of this controversy is

therefore necessary and appropriate.

16 disclosure provisions of CEQA" when it "omit[s] any meaningful consideration" of a potentially

17 significant environmental impact identified in the record. Bakersfield Citizens for Local Control v. City

18 of Bakersfield (*Bakersfield Citizens") (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1184, 1208. Contrary to CEQA, the

19 FEIR omits meaningful consideration of the following potentially significant environmental impacts:

20 The EIR Fails to Meaningfully Analyze Numerous Significant Environmental Impacts

21 67. The FEIR fails to acknowledge, let alone analyze, the fact that the Project will
22 permanently alter future development of the Jacumba Valley, transforming it from an extraordinary

23 scenic treasure that has drawn visitors from throughout the world to enjoy its healing mineral waters and

24 serene bucolic splendor, into an ugly, foreboding, industrial eyesore. The Project's industrialization of a

25 fertile plain with abundant wildlife and stunning vistas of surrounding and still largely unspoiled
26 mountain ranges conflicts profoundly with the County General Plan's reservation of this unique rural site

27 for a comprehensively planned community that would implement the Jacumba community's consistently

28 expressed desire for a small-scale, self-sufficient, environmentally-friendly village seeking to restore its

1 previous success as a regional destination resort.

2 The EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze the Project's Impacts on Wildlife

3 68. The FEIR fails to adequately disclose and analyze the Project's impacts on wildlife. The

4 California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW") timely advised the County in writing of "a

5 number of shortcomings in the Project's approach" including the County's failure to abide by its
6 "Planning Agreement . signed at the end of 2020 between the County, CDFW and [the United States

7 Fish and Wildlife Service] regarding review of interim projects while preparing the North and East

8 County NCCP/HCP [Natural Community Conservation Planning/Habitat Conservation Plan] Plans."

9 Letter from CDFW to San Diego County dated August 18, 2021 at p. 1. As CDFW explained, it "had
10 recommended that focused surveys be performed for any and all California species of Special Concern

11 (SSC) that may be present on the Project site." Id. CDFW pointed out that the County had not
12 conducted the surveys, nor provided the mitigation measures required under that agreement for several

13 species of concern that are either known to inhabit, or that may inhabit, the Project site, including the

14 tricolored blackbird, a California Threatened Species, golden eagle, burrowing owl, northern harrier,
15 yellow-headed blackbird, San Diego black-tailed jackrabbit, and the federally endangered Quino
16 checkerspot butterfly. Id. at pp. 1-3.
17 69. For example, the FEIR glosses over the fact that the Project would destroy at least 593

18 acres of potential foraging habitat for the tricolored blackbird. Letter from CDFW to San Diego County

19 dated December 7, 2020 at p. 7. The FEIR claims this impact is "insignificant," based on the premise

20 that other habitat would remain in the area. This premise ignores the fact that the most common reason a

21 species such as the tricolored blackbird becomes imperiled is loss of habitat, and thus any substantial
22 reduction in habitat for an imperiled species is a significant impact on the species. The loss of nearly

23 600 acres of habitat is plainly substantial. Protection of biological resources is a fundamental policy
24 incorporated into CEQA. Public Resources Codes section 21001(c) declares that it is the policy of the

25 state to "[p]revent the elimination of fish or wildlife species due to man's activities . . . . The FEIR's

26 failure to recognize that this substantial loss of habitat for the imperiled tricolored blackbird is a

27 significant impact contravenes this statutory command.

28 70. For a second example, the FEIR erroneously claims that the Project's removal of 96 acres

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 23 -

-

2 of desert saltbrush scrub, which provides habitat for numerous special status plant and wildlife species,

3 is rendered insignificant by easement mitigation. Id. at p. 2. The significance of this loss is not reduced

4 by the Project's placement of 100 acres of similar habitat elsewhere in an offsite open space easement,

5 since there is still a net loss of nearly 100 acres of this habitat. Courts have recognized that the loss of

6 discrete acreage of: defined resource cannot be mitigated through programs that prevent other losses of

7 that resource elsewhere, correctly reasoning that such attempts at mitigation do not change the bottom

8 line that at the end of the day, there is still a net loss in the acreage of the resource in question. Thus, in
King & Gardiner Farms, LLC v. County of Kern (2020) 45 Cal.App. 5th 814, 875, the court ruled that
9 requiring conservation easements over off-site farmland did not provide effective mitigation for the

10

11 impact of converting farmland to another use. The court reasoned, correctly, that a conservation

12 easement does not create new farmland to replace the land being converted, and thus does not offset the

13 loss of farmland resulting from the project. Likewise here, the creation of a conservation easement to

14 ostensibly protect similar habitat elsewhere neither creates new habitat, nor restores the habitat that this
Project will destroy.

15 71.

16 For a third example, according to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service ("FWS"),

17 "[s]everal utility-scale solar projects in the Mojave Desert have reported significant avian mortalities,

18 including waterbirds." Email from FWS to San Diego County dated December 7, 2020 at p. 1. This is

19 primarily due to the "pseudo-lake" effect of solar energy projects whose large solar panel arrays appear

20 to be a water surface to migratory bird species, who attempt to land or forage on what they perceive to be

21 a lake and suffer "immediate death due to fatal blunt trauma" or in the case of waterfowl, even if they

22 land safely, they are unable to take off because waterfowl require long stretches of open water to achieve

23 flight speed. Consequently, they "succumb to heat exhaustion" because they are stranded on the hot
surface of the solar panels, which the FEIR admits can reach burning temperatures of 158 degrees
24 Fahrenheit. Id. at attached report to FWS at p. 8; FEIR Global Response GR-2 at p. 1. The FEIR

25 wrongly dismisses this well-documented impact on the grounds that "there is little scientific information
26 available regarding the a pseudo-lake effect, and a detailed discussion of the impacts would be

27 speculative." FEIR Response A4-1. In fact, as the FWS explained, and documented with the report it
28 attached to its expert comment, there is substantial not "little" - scientific evidence confirming this

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 24 -

1 effect, and thus the detailed discussion of this serious effect that CEQA requires would not be

2 "speculative" as the FEIR claims.

3 72. The Project threatens to impede wildlife connectivity between the Peninsular ranges of the

4 adjacent Anza-Borrego Desert State Park Wilderness to the north and the continuation of those ranges in

5 the mountainous wildlands of Mexico to the south. Loss of this connectivity would prevent seasonal

6 migration and ultimately impair genetic diversity, harming and potentially extirpating mammals such as

7 the Peninsular bighorn sheep that require this migratory corridor for their survival. Letter from

8 California Department of Parks and Recreation ("California State Parks") to San Diego County dated

9 December 7, 2020 at p. 3. Therefore California State Parks advised the County that "environmental
10 review of this project must include the wildlife connectivity through the Peninsular Ranges between

11 Mexico and the Untied States." Id. In response, the FEIR asserts that "the comment does not raise an

12 issue regarding the adequacy of analysis contained within the Draft EIR; therefore, no further response is

13 required." FEIR at A3-16. Instead of addressing the need to provide for north-south migration of

14 wildlife across the Project site, the FEIR denies that there is any need at all, "since wildlife is not
15 constrained to travel through the area." Id. Blocking off north-south wildlife migration through the

16 Project site's one-mile-wide flood plain on the grounds wildlife can go elsewhere repeats the same lack

17 of logic the FEIR displayed in dismissing the Project's reduction in the tricolored blackbird's habitat on
18 the grounds it has other habitat elsewhere. Each loss of habitat or connectivity matters.

19 73. The Project would have a detrimental "heat island" effect in which ambient air
20 temperatures are raised significantly due to the fact that the solar panels would attract and hold heat from

21 the sun, reaching surface temperatures as high as 158 degrees Fahrenheit. Email from FWS to San

22 Diego County dated December 7, 2020, attached report at p. 8. Although the FEIR touches on this issue,

23 the specific impacts on vulnerable birds and the insects on which many feed are not adequately

24 addressed.

25 The EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze the Project's Impacts on Culural Resources

26 74. CEQA was amended in 2014 to require EIRs to specifically address impacts on "tribal

27 cultural resources," which are broadly defined to include "sites, features, places, cultural landscapes,

28 sacred places and objects with cultural value to a California Native American tribe." Pub. Res .C.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 25 -

1 §21074(a). Courts require strict compliance with these requirements. Save the Agoura Cornell Knoll V.

2 City of Agoura Hills (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 665, 687 (rejecting city's dismissal of comments by cultural

3 resource expert as mere "speculation and unsubstantiated opinion"). Although the Project's impacts on

4 cultural resources are likewise significant, the County's FEIR fails to adequately study and mitigate

5 them, and to respond in good faith to the expert concerns expressed by a California Native American

6 Tribe. The Manzanita Band of the Kumeyaay Nation, a federally-recognized Self-Governance Indian

7 Tribe, timely objected in writing to the Project and its FEIR on August 17, 2021. It pointed out that

8 "Jacumba Valley (Jacume/Hametaay) is a village site extending from its center near the Jacumba Hot

9 Springs several miles in all directions, including the project area .. . . Jacumba Valley is the central
10 location of a Kumeyaay origin story," and includes "several types of important resources such as village

11 sites, sacred area, and plant gathering locales, trails, ceremonial sites, cremation, burials, and other

12 significant resources . Letter from Manzanita Band of the Kumeyaay Nation to San Diego County

13 dated August 17, 2021, at pp. 1-2. The Manzanita Band objected that "[t]he County has not fully and
14 meaningfully conducted adequate government-to-government consultation" with the Tribe. Id. Due in

15 part to the County's failure to engage in adequate consultation, its environmental review of the Project's
16 impacts on cultural resources was woefully deficient. The Manzanita Band objected, for example, that:

17 "The EIR contains no consideration of the cumulative effects on this area and these sites. Cultural

18 resources are non-renewable resources, and destroying any of them is erasing our history.
We are very concerned about the research and information used by [the consultant that prepared 19 the EIR] to [r]each their conclusions in favor of the developer rather than the protection of cultural
resources."
20
It is our firm belief that the EIR is severely technically flawed, inadequate to approve the projects, 21 and heavily weighted in support of the developer[']s proposal.. Not only are real and potential impacts to cultural resources amnd tribal cultural resources minimized, their analysis is segmented
22 to further reduce and negate any impacts."

23 Id. at pp. 2-3. In response, the County refused to reopen government-to-government consultation with

24 the Manzanita Tribe on the grounds that the Tribe had missed one of two deadlines for consultation and,

25 although it admitted that the Tribe met the other one, it considered the Tribe nonresponsive to the

26 County's requests for meeting dates and therefore unilaterally terminated the consultation, claiming that

27 as a consequence, "formal consultation is not required." FEIR at Response T3-4. Thereafter, the FEIR

28 essentially dismissed each of the Tribe's detailed substantive objections and requests for information

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 26 -

H

2 while at the same time repeatedly stating to the contrary that "[t]he County looks forward to working

3 with Manzanita should consultation be required." Id. at T3-4 - T3-29 . Comparing the Tribe's

4 comments and requests with the County's dismissals of them, it does not appear that the County has
complied with the letter and the spirit of CEQA's requirements for detailed examination of this Project's
5 impacts on cultural resources.

6

7 75. The EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze the Project's Impacts on Agriculture

8 The Project's impacts on agricultural resources are similarly significant and yet

9 inadequately studied and mitigated. Courts recognize that the loss of farmland is a significant impact
under CEQA. King & Gardiner Frams, LLC, supra, 45 Cal.App.5th at 875 (holding that requiring
10 conservation easements over off-site farmland did not provide effective mitigaiton for the significant

11 impact of converting farmland to another use). Here, the Project's impacts on farmland are
12 demonstrably significant. The Project would destroy 275 acres of Prime Farmland, 143.4 acres of

13

14 Farmland of Statewide Importance, 4.3 acres of Unique Farmland, and 35.3 acres of Farmland of Local

15 Importance, as designated by the California Department of Conservation. The Project site has been used
for dairy farming since at least the 1950s, and more than one-third of the Project site has soil that
16 supports irrigated cropland. The evidence of the Project site's past farming use and substantial acreage

17 of farmland of both local and statewide importance as measured by the California Department of
18 | Conservation is indisputable.

19 76.

20 Yet the FEIR asserts that the Project's elimination of farming on this site for at least the

21 duration of the Project, and the Project's conversion of the site's extensive acreage of high quality
farmland are not significant impacts. FEIR 3.1.1-15, 3.1.1-18. The County's asserted basis for this
22 conclusion is that its newly developed LARA (Local Agricultural Resources Assessment) model rated

23 the site's climate, water and soil quality to be of just "moderate" quality, and although two of the
24 "complementary factors" were rated "high, the third - land use consistency - was assigned a "low"
25 rating. Id. at p. 3.1.4-61. But in the absence of the required specific plan for this site, there is no basis

26

27 for assigned its land use consistency a failing grade. Indeed, the County admits elsewhere that the

28 Project itself is not consistent with the planning and zoning classification for this site, as noted above.

77. The County's conclusion that the loss of 600 acres of farmland recognized as high quality

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 27 -

1 by the California Department of Conservation is arbitrary on its face, and flatly contradicted by the site's
2 long-standing successful farm use. The FEIR ignores at least 75 years of successful agricultural land use

3 (1918 to 1945 and intermittently thereafter until at least 2012), including the creation and sustained

4 operation of the largest dairy farm in southern San Diego County, the Mountain Meadow Dairy and
5 Creamery's Sunshine Ranch. Letter from Save Our Heritage Organization ("SOHO") to the County

6 dated July 8, 2021 at pp. 1-2; letter from Mountain Empire Historical Society ("MEHS") to the County

7 dated August 8, 2021. Based on its erroneous premise of "insignificant impact," the FEIR fails to
8 provide the mitigation that is required to avoid or reduce the Project's significant impacts on these

9 outstanding and irreplaceable farmlands.

10 The FEIR Fails to Adequately Analyze the Project's Wildfire Impacts

11 78. The Project's impacts on public safety due to its dramatically increased wildfire hazards

12 are likewise significant and yet inadequately studied and mitigated. Letter from Boulevard Planning

13 Group (*'BPG") to San Diego County dated April 7, 2019 (and attached to BPG's letter dated December

14 projects cause a "significant increase in wild fire ignition sources and fire- 7, 2020) at p. 5. Solar energy

15 fighting impediments/hazards." Id. This Project "has the potential to ignite wildfires through attraction

16 of lightning strikes and/or through electrical faults or other malfunctions in project components . . . .

17 additional sources of wildfire ignition and hazardous/toxic fumes generated by Battery storage represents

18 burning lithium ion batteries and thermal runaway events." Id. at p. 24.

19 79. Not only do photovoltaic energy projects create thousands of electrical connections that
20 transfer enormous quantities of electrical energy in hot, arid areas prone to wildfire ignition, they also

21 impede the suppression of wildfires that occur near or within these high energy fields. For example,

22 "[f]ire fighters will need to wait for a fire to burn out of the project area to avoid potential electrical/toxic

23 fumes/hazards, thereby allowing a fire to potentially increase in size o[r] blow out of control." Id. at p.

24 5. Two of San Diego County's most destructive wildfires over the past 20 years - the Witch and Pines

25 fires - were caused by power lines in remote rural areas. According to the California Department of

26 Forestry and Fire Protection ("CalFire"), at least 29 fires over 10 acres in size have occurred during the

27 past five decades in the extremely high fire hazard zone in which Jacumba is located.

28 80. Notwithstanding the Project's indisputable wildfire hazards as summarized above, the

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 28 -

H

2 County deemed them only "potentially significant." FEIR at 2.12.3.2. The FEIR considered as potential
mitigation measures the enforcement of routine fire code requirements and the usual "defensible space"
3 restrictions, but never seriously considered the far simpler, safer and more efficient means of obtaining

4

5 the Project's primary objective of supplying renewable energy to San Diego's urban areas: rejecting the

6 siting of this dangerous industrial-scale solar energy facility in a high-wildfire hazard zone requiring

7 scores of miles of transmission lines through remote, arid, inaccessible and wildfire-prone mountains in

8 favor of programs to promote the installation of far safer roof-top solar panels in the urban areas where
the energy from this Project would be used.

9

10 The EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze the Project's Impacts on Groundwater Supply

81.

11 The Project's impacts on groundwater are likewise potentially significant and yet

12 inadequately studied and mitigated. Groundwater is the exclusive source of water for residential,

13 agricultural, and commercial uses in the Jacumba Valley. Yet in listing the uses in the Project area that

14 rely upon the local purveyor of groundwater, the Jacumba Community Services District ("JCSD"), the

15 FEIR omits entirely the Jacumba Hot Springs Resort, which like all the other uses in the area, is solely
dependent on JCSD for the water that serves its resort and its visitors. Although local residents have
16 experienced sharply fluctuating groundwater levels in recent decades as global warming increases

17

18 temperatures and decreases precipitation, no groundwater management agency oversees groundwater
management in the Jacumba Valley Groundwater Basin on which Jacumba Hot Springs Resort, Jacumba
19 residents, other Jacumba businesses, and if approved the Project would as well, rely. The absence of any
20 regulatory authority to assure that groundwater pumping for existing and future uses is managed properly

21

22 heightens the need for careful and comprehensive examination of the Project's impacts on the Jacumba

23 Valley's essential but vulnerable groundwater supplies. But rather than provide the information vitally
needed by the public to evaluate the Project's impacts on groundwater particularly during accelerated
24 pumping for construction, the FEIR glosses over the potential for shortfalls due to excessive pumping by
25 providing only a gross estimate of total aquifer storage in the area and dismissing impacts on water
26 availability on the asserted grounds that construction of the Project would use only 1.6 percent of that

27 estimated total storage. FEIR at p. 2.7-35.

2 82. The EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze the Project's Needless Impacts on Jacumba

3 The Project's impacts on the adjacent community of Jacumba are similarly significant and

4 yet inadequately studied and mitigated. The Project as approved would needlessly occupy over 600 acres

5 of land, more than six times the area occupied by the adjacent, existing community of Jacumba - roughly

6 100 acres. The Project proponent insisted throughout the approval process that it required at least 600
acres for its solar modules to generate what it characterized as its financial bottom line: a sustained
7 generation level of 90 MW.

8 83.

9 But careful review of the developer's representations - on which the County uncritically

10 relied - reveals that far less acreage was in fact required to generate the target electrical output. Other

similar solar energy projects require far less

11 acreage to generate comparable levels of energy. For

12 example, the Viking Energy Solar Project in nearby Imperial County generates 150 MW on just 604
acres - a ratio of 4 MW

13 per acre. The Aramis Solar Project in the Livermore Valley generates 100 MW
on just 410 acres- a ratio of 4.1 MW per acre. Applying these ratios yields an acreage required to

14 generate the developer's desired 90 MW of just 360 to 375 acres (4 MW/acre times 90 MW = 360

15 acres).

16 84.

17 Using the County's own figures likewise confirms this to be the case. According to the

18 FEIR Appendix V, and the Planning Commission's July 9, 2021 Hearing Report at page 3-3, this Project

19 uses 540-watt photovoltaic panels. Multiplying the 291,000 panels approved by the County times 540

20 watts yields 157,140 watts, or 157 MW direct current ("DC") capacity. Appendix V, Table incorrectly

21 states that the resulting DC capacity is between 110 MW and 115 MW, a plain arithmetic error.

22 Converting this direct current energy into alternating current ("AC") typically requires about 1.25 watts
of DC current to yield 1 watt of AC current. Letter from ZGlobal to San Diego County dated August 17,
23 2021 at p. 1. Dividing 157,140 MW by this 1.25/1.00 ratio yields an AC current capacity of 125,712

24

25 watts, or 125 MW. Thus, the developer's stated number of solar panels - 291,000 - times the stated

26 wattage capacity of each panel - 540 - yields an AC current capacity of 125 MW, far more than the 90
MW target.

27 85.

28 To derive the number of 540-watt panels needed to generate the target generation of 90
MW, one simply multiplies 90 MW times the same 1.25 ratio to calculate the AC current equivalent,

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 30 -

H

2 112.5 MW, and then divide by 540 watts to yield the number of panels needed, 208,600. Id. at p. 3.

3 Thus, this Project requires only about 208,600 panels, not 291,000 panels, to generate the target
generation of 90 MW.

4 86.

5 Converting this reduced number of needed panels - 208,600 - into the reduced acreage

6 required to support them is likewise a simple mathematical calculation. Id. at p. 5, Table 2. Instead of a

7 need for more than 600 acres as the developer erroneously claimed and the County mistakenly accepted,
and allowing for all the clearances and dimensions claimed by the developer, only 396 acres are actually
8 needed to generate the target generation of 90 MW. Id. Adding in a "safety factor " of 20% yields a

9

10 maximum acreage needed of just 475 acres, not the more than 600 acres claimed by the developer and
approved by the County.

11 87. In effect, the County was hoodwinked into approving development of a much larger
12 acreage than was actually needed to generate the target generation of 90 MW. This is a critical error,

13 because the County relied on the developer's contrary representations to reject consideration of far less
14 impactful alternatives that would dramatically reduce the acreage required for this Project. A much

15 smaller footprint would allow much greater setbacks from the Village of Jacumba, vastly reducing the
16 Project's adverse environmental impacts.

17

18 88. The EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze the Project's Greenhouse Gas Emissions
The Project's claimed reductions in greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil-fuel-
19 powered energy sources are likewise exaggerated. This is So because they overlook three salient facts.

20

21 First, the alternative of generating comparable electricity with roof-top (and similar urban solar sources
utilizing existing buildings or structures such as parking garage roofs) yields greater power at less cost
22 because it avoids the tremendous loss of power that occurs when it is transmitted over long distances as

23 is the case with this Project.

24 89.

25 Second, the FEIR ignores the massive greenhouse emissions that result from wildfires

26 caused by power line ignitions. Many of the worst wildfires in California history such as the Witch and

27 Pines fires in San Diego County, the Camp Fire in Butte County that incinerated the town of Paradise,

28 and most of the fires that scorched hundreds of thousands of acres in Sonoma and Napa counties during
the past two decades were caused by power lines in rural areas. The carbon emissions from these fires

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 31 -

1 caused smoky skies over much of North America for weeks, dwarfing the life-time emission reductions

2 claimed for the Project. Yet the FEIR ignores this fatal flaw in its greenhouse gas emission calculations.
3 90. Third, the FEIR also fails to calculate the lifecycle emissions of the Project, which include

4 not just emissions associated with Project construction and operation, but also the manufacturing and
5 transporting of the Project components, and the decommissioning of the Project and attempted

6 restoration of the Project site.

7 91. The Project places a high energy electrical generation and storage facility nearly one

8 square mile in size in the middle of an historical flood plain in which the FEIR admits flood heights

9 could reach six feet, substantially higher than the 4.5-foot high (and erodible) berms on which solar

10 equipment would be placed. FEIR at p. 2.7-6. The Jacumba Valley flooded as recently as the summer of

11 2014 on the Project site. Yet the FEIR erroneously asserts that the Project is not located within a 100-
12 year floodplain or other special flood hazard area. FEIR at p. 2.7-41. The FEIR inconsistently states that

13 the Federal Emergency Management Agency ("FEMA") has not analyzed the project as a flood hazard

14 but then states that this analysis should be done before approval of a grading plan, squarely placing the

15 approval cart before the analysis horse. FEIR at p. 3.1.8-9.

16 The FEIR Fails to Meaningfully Analyze the Project's Impacts to Aviation

17 92. The Project locates solar arrays on three sides of the Jacumba Airport runway, within the
18 striking range of glider winch/towing cables that may be jettisoned during emergency situations, and

19 counts the narrow corridors between solar arrays in claiming that planes in distress have room to land in

20 the solar arrays. The absurdity of placing an electrical facility posing an extreme fire hazard next to and

21 at the end of an airport runway is heightened by the fact that this airport is frequently used by gliders that

22 require for take-off a winched cable that may be jettisoned over the solar arrays, and that require repeated

23 circling to determine wind speed and direction before landing, resulting in flight paths that are
24 unpredictable and impossible to conform to the Project's solar arrays, which are fixed in a north-south

25 configuration that conflicts with the east-west orientation of the most common flight paths.

26 The EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze the Project's Impacts on Land Use

27 93. The FEIR fails to address the fact that the Project allows a land use admittedly inconsistent

28 with the County General Plan and Zoning on the false premise that it is merely a "temporary" rather than

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 32 -

1 permanent use, ignoring the facts that first, the Project creates potentially unstoppable momentum in

2 favor of renewing the Project's 35-year ostensible permit life (or simply replacing this facility with an

3 upgraded version of itself), and second, this 35-year duration would outlive most of the current residents

4 of Jacumba. The FEIR admits that the Project is not consistent with the Zoning Ordinance, stating that

5 "[a]fter decommissioning, the land would have to return to a land use that is consistent with the County

6 of San Diego zoning ordinance at the time of decommissioning." Id. at p. 1-21. Confirming its pre-

7 ordained permanence, the Project includes a large Switchyard that will be turned over to SDG&E after

8 its construction, establishing an industrial-scale renewable energy utility within Jacumba's rural village
9 boundary in perpetuity that will invite, if not mandate, the continued operation of the Project and
10 potentially others like it long after its ostensible 35-year permit life. The County planning staff admitted

11 in their Hearing Report dated August 6, 2021 that before the permit expires the applicant could apply for

12 and receive approval of an MUP modification to authorize continued use of the site as a solar facility.

13 Id. at p. 3-15.

14 94. Even where the Project's impacts on land use are indisputably significant, as they are on
15 aesthetic resources, the FEIR strains credulity in its efforts to understate those impacts. For example, the
16 Project's impacts on aesthetic resources are immense and undeniable. They include massive industrial

17 development adjacent to the County's designated scenic highway, Old Highway 80, which the Project

18 crowds on both sides for nearly one mile. The County's applicable Subregional Plan has a goal of
19 establishing a network of scenic highway corridors within which scenic, historical and recreational

20 resources are not only protected but enhanced, and Old Highway 80 is one of the named scenic highway

21 corridors that is subject to that goal. The FEIR admits that "Old Highway 80, which parallels the Project

22 site for approximately 1 mile, is also included in the County Scenic Highway System (County of San

23 Diego 2011a)," FEIR at 2.1-8, and that "Old Highway 80 is a designated California State Historic Route.

24 In 2006, the state legislature granted this designation in recognition of the highway's 'outstanding natural,

25 cultural, historic and scenic qualities." FEIR at 2.1-13. The FEIR also concedes, as it must, that the

26 Project would have significant impacts on those traveling down Old Highway 80 or who live near it. Id.

27 95. And yet, despite these concessions to reality, the FEIR arbitrarily concludes that the

28 Project is consistent with the County's land use policy of protecting and enhancing the very scenic

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 33 -

1 corridor it concedes the Project degrades because "there are no current local regulations governing
2 development of lands along I-8 or Old Highway 80." Id. But the Subregional Plan does not state that its
3 express goals only apply when the designated corridors are also protected by some other regulation.

4 Equally illogically, the FEIR attempts to justify its conclusion that having a significant visual impact on

5 views along State-designated scenic highway corridor is nonetheless consistent with the Scenic

6 Highways Goal of protecting and enhancing these highways by arguing the County could still establish

7 and designate Old Highway 80 a as a scenic highway, even though the views which make it scenic would

8 be gone. FEIR at p. 2.1-73, Table 2.1. To the contrary, destroying the visual resource that prompted this
9 highway's designation as scenic obviously torpedoes the basis for designating it in the first place.
10 Moreover, the FEIR ignores the County's duty under the Planning and Zoning Law to comply with its

11 Subregional Plan goal to protect and enhance these scenic highways. For these reasons, the FEIR's
12 claim that the Project is consistent with the Scenic Highways Goal of the Subregional Plan is contrary to

13 fact and irrational. It therefore violates as well the County's CEQA duty to "discuss any inconsistencies

14 between the proposed project and applicable general plans, specific plans and regional plans."

15 Guidelines §15125(d).

16 The EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze the Project's Use of Lithium-Ion Batteries

17 96. The FEIR erroneously assumes the need for the Project to utilize a type of battery storage
18 that iS particularly dangerous due to its propensity to ignite, the difficulty of extinguishing its fires, and

19 the toxic fumes it would emit during a fire. The Project proposes the needless use of 75 potentially
20 flammable lithium batteries that are prone to runaway fires and contain toxic materials rather than the

21 eminently feasible and much safer iron-flow batteries currently in use at the SDG&E I MW solar facility

22 in Campo. The FEIR admits that because of their toxicity and difficulty in extinguishing, should they

23 catch fire the County "would let the batteries burn in place." Id. at p. 2.6-47. In July 2021, the flames
24 that resulted from a large lithium-ion battery explosion in Australia took three days to be extinguished.

25 Given that the prevailing winds in the Project area are frequently from the east toward the village, toxic

26 fumes from burning batteries would drift toward residences and endanger the health of their occupants.

27 The EIR Erroneously Assumes a Compelling Need for This Impactful Project

28 97. The FEIR assumes a need for the Project that is actually met by other renewable energy

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 34 -

1 projects in the approval process. The Project is not needed to meet state and local climate action goals as

2 there are already many less impactful renewable energy projects in the existing approval pipeline,

3 including six projects with a combined capacity of 2,918 MW within the general area of the Project that

4 are requesting connection to the existing ECO Substation less than three miles east of the Project site.

5 Letter from ZGlobal to San Diego County dated August 17, 2021 at pp. 2-3.

6 98. The FEIR likewise assumes need for the Project's Switchyard that does not exist. The

7 Project includes an 8.1-acre Switchyard that is completely unnecessary, as it duplicates an existing

8 switchyard located less than three miles to the east at the East County ("ECO") Substation. Letter from

9 ZGlobal to San Diego County dated August 17, 2021 at p. 7. This new Switchyard will upon completion

10 be transferred to SDG&E and be removed from County jurisdiction, as regulatory control will then shift

11 to the CPUC, effectively creating a permanent industrial facility whose sole purpose is to transfer electric

12 energy from new industrial-scale energy projects in the middle of the Jacumba Valley, refuting the

13 County's disclaimer that the approved Project is a mere "temporary use," and divesting the impacted

14 residents of Jacumba of any direct land use control over this use.

15 The FEIR Fails to Consider a Reasonable Range of Alternatives

16 99. The FEIR fails to consider a reasonable range of alternatives for several reasons. First, it

17 rejects projects with smaller footprints because it erroneously assumes that far more acreage - more than

18 600 acres - is needed for this Project to meet its objective of generating 90 MW than what the facts

19 support. In fact, as demonstrated in the County's own documents, only about 400 acres (or about 475
20 acres if a 20% "security factor" is included) are needed for this purpose. Letter from ZGlobal to San

21 Diego County dated August 17, 20231 at pp. 3-5 and Tables 1 and 2. Reducing the Project's footprint by

22 over 120 acres would provide much larger setbacks from the community of Jacumba as its residents have

23 requested, and allow for the creation of adequate wildlife migration corridors through the Project, among

24 other substantial reductions in the Project's adverse environmental impacts.

25 100. Second, the FEIR fails to consider less impactful alternate locations for this Project
26 without adequately examining the full range of alternative sites, based on the developer's false narrative

27 that only this highly impactful site meets its financial and temporal constraints. The facts reveal to the

28 contrary the availability of other less impactful sites for this Project, and indeed, there are many other

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 35 -

-

2 less impactful renewable energy projects already in the approval pipeline within the region.

101. Third, the FEIR dismisses the alternative of promoting roof-top and similar distributed
3 renewable energy projects within the urban areas where energy

4 demand is greatest on the grounds the
developer in entitled to set the County's agenda as to what renewable energy projects it may consider by
5 limiting the range of alternatives to those that are "utility scale." FEIR at p. 4.1. But limiting the range

6

7 to alternatives that involve massive, industrial-scale projects defeats CEQA purpose of forcing agencies

8 to expand their horizons by considering better, less-impactful means of achieving the basic objectives of

9 a proposed project - in this case, the generation of renewable energy for use not locally in Jacumba, but

10 rather in distant urban areas such as San Diego. As noted above, there is overwhelming evidence that

11 such distributed renewable energy programs hold the potential to more than meet this Project's

12 renewable energy objectives at far less environmental risk and impact. But rather than perform its

13 CEQA duty to identify and assess them, the County limited its - and the public's - consideration to just

14 two action alternatives that were both essentially the developer's proposed Project at slightly reduced
dimensions. The County missed the forest for the trees.

15

16 The County's Environmental Findings Including Its Statement of Overriding Considerations Are
Not Supported by Substantial Evidence

17 102.

18 Because the County conceded that the Project would have significant unmitigated

19 environmental impacts, including impacts to aesthetics, biological resources, tribal cultural resources
and wildfire, among others (FEIR at 2-1), it could not approve the Project without detailed findings
20 explaining why "overriding considerations" compelled approval notwithstanding these significant

21

22 effects. Pub. Res. C. § 21081; CEQA Guidelines § 15093. That statement of overriding considerations

23 "shall be supported by substantial evidence in the record" showing that the benefits of the Project

24 outweigh its unmitigated environmental impacts. CEQA Guidelines § 15093(b).

103.

25 In particular, if a project will have "significant environmental effects," CEQA requires the
agency to make "one or more written findings for each of those significant effects, accompanied by a
26 brief explanation of the rationale for each finding." Guidelines § 15091(a). There are three "possible

27 findings:"

28 //

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 36 -

1 (1) Changes or alterations have been required in, or incorporated into, the project which avoid or substantially lessen the significant environmental effect . . . .
2
(2)
3 Such changes or alterations are within the responsibility and jurisdiction of another public agency and have been adopted ... or can and should be adopted by such
other agency.
4
(3) make
5 Specific economic, legal, social, technological, or other considerations . infeasible the mitigation measures or project alternatives identified in the final EIR.

6
Guidelines §15091(a); PRC § 21081(a). The findings "shall be supported by substantial evidence in the
7 record." Guidelines § 15091(b). Where, as here, an agency approves a project with significant 8
environmental effects that "are not avoided or substantially lessened," the agency must "state in writing 9

10 the specific reasons to support its action." Guidelines §§ 15093(b), 15096(h), 15064(a)(2). This

11 "statement of overriding considerations shall be supported by substantial evidence," Guidelines section

12 15093(b), and is in addition to the findings required under section 15091. Guidelines 15091(f).

104.
13 Requiring such findings and, when necessary, a statement of overriding considerations,
ensures that the agency carefully considers the proposed action's environmental effects and makes its 14
decisionmaking process transparent. The "intended effect is to facilitate orderly analysis and minimize
15
the likelihood that the agency will randomly leap from evidence to conclusions." Topanga Assn. for a 16
Scenic Com. V. County of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 516-517. Since they lay out the agency's 17

18 rationale, findings also help courts to police agency compliance with CEQA's required procedures. Mira
Mar Mobile Com. V. City of Oceanside (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 477, 496 (noting that "findings must 19

20 *bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and ultimate decision,' so as to allow a reviewing

21 court "to trace and examine the agency's mode of analysis') (citation omitted).

105. "A statement of overriding considerations .. offers a proper basis for approving project 22

23 despite the existence of unmitigated environmental effects[] only when the measures necessary to
mitigate or avoid those effects have properly been found to be infeasible." Uphold Our Heritage v. 24

25 Town of Woodside (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 587, 603 (quoting City of Marina v. Board of Trustees of
California State University (2006) 39 Cal.4th 341, 368) (emphasis added). Where an agency's record 26

27 "does not support [its] finding that all of the alternatives included in the EIR are infeasible, the

28 [agency's] statement of overriding circumstances is necessarily invalid." Uphold our Heritage, 147

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 37 -

-

2 Cal.App.4th 603. Thus, where, as here, an agency's findings and statement of overriding consideration

3 lack substantial evidentiary support, the agency has violated CEQA. Id.; PRC §§ 21081.5; Guidelines §§
15091(b), 15093(b).

4 106.

5 The County attempted to comply with the foregoing CEQA requirements, but its effort

6 failed to pass CEQA muster. It adopted a Statement of Overriding Considerations as part of its Findings

7 Regarding Significant Effects Pursuant to State CEQA Guidelines ("Findings") dated August 18, 2021,

8 at pp. 61-66. But those Findings, including their Statement of Overriding Considerations, are not

9 supported by substantial evidence. They repeat many of the errors and omissions that plague the FEIR

10 and which are identified and discussed above. Many of these errors and omissions bear on and

11 undermine the County's recitation of the Project's claimed benefits, while at the same time they ignore
or understate the Project's adverse impacts. Consequently, the County's Findings, and its Statement of
12 Overriding Considerations, violate CEQA.

13 107.

14 For each of the foregoing reasons, the County's Project Approvals violate CEQA, and

must be set aside.

15 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

16

17 (Writ of Mandate and Declaratory Relief to Set Aside the Board's Project Approvals as Contrary to the Planning and Zoning Law, San Diego County General Plan and San Diego County Zoning Ordinance)

18
108.
19
reference. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by

20

21 109. Petitioners bring this Second Cause of Action on the grounds that the Board's adoption of

22 the Project Approvals was ultra vires and must be set aside because the Project would violate the

23 Planning and Zoning Law (Government Code section 65000 et seq.), the San Diego County General Plan

24 and the San Diego County Zoning Ordinance as alleged below.

110.
25 As a general law jurisdiction, San Diego County must assure that its planning, zoning and

26 permitting decisions comply with the state Planning and Zoning Law. That requirement includes

27 complying with the County's own General Plan and Zoning Ordinance. As explained in Neighborhood

28 Action Group v. County of Calaveras, supra, 156 Cal.App.3d at 1184, a county may not approve a use

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 38 -

1 permit such as the Major Use Permit it approved for the Project here, unless that permit complies with
2 both the county zoning ordinance and the county general plan:

3 To view them in order: a use permit is struck from the mold of the zoning law ([Government

4 Code section] 65901); the zoning law must comply with the adopted general plan (§ 65860); the adopted general plan must conform with state law (§§ 65300, 65302). The validity of the permit process derives from compliance with this hierarchy of planning laws. These laws delimit the
5 authority of the permit issuing agency to act and establish the measure of a valid permit. . . . A permit action taken without compliance with the hierarchy of land use laws is ultra vires as to any 6 defect implicated by the uses sought by the permit.

7 Id.; accord, Government Code section 65860(a) ("County or city zoning ordinances shall be consistent

8 with the general plan of the county or city by January 1, 1974."). Where a general plan policy is

9 "fundamental, mandatory and specific," the local government must strictly comply with the policy.

10 FUTURE v. Board of Supervisors (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1342. It has no discretion to interpret

11 away a specific mandate contrary to the general plan's plain language.

12 111. Courts do not defer to local government interpretations of general plan mandates that

13 contravene their plain meaning. Lindstrom v. California Coastal Commission (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 73,

14 96 ("because the meaning of the relevant provisions of the City's [plan] is plain, we need not resolve the

15 issue" of "what degree of deference, if any, would be appropriate"); California Native Plant Society v.

16 City of Santa Cruz (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 957, 637 ("deference to the City's interpretation of its

17 general plan" was unwarranted because the city's interpretation of the term "coordination" as used in a

18 general plan mandate requiring mitigation "designed ... in coordination with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife

19 Service" was contrary to the term's plain meaning); Cleveland National Forest Foundation V. County of
20 San Diego (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 1021, 1041 (in interpreting General plan, courts "begin as always with

21 the statute's actual words;" quotations and citations omitted).

22 112. Furthermore, where a county approves a project in its quasi-adjudicatory capacity, as the

23 Board did here in issuing a use permit, it is that government's burden to demonstrate through findings,

24 and with evidence in the record supporting those findings, that the project in question - and the use
25 permits required for that project - are consistent with the relevant general plan and zoning ordinance.

26 CCP § 1094.5(b) ("Abuse of discretion is established if the respondent has not proceeded in the manner

27 required by law, the order or decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported

28 by the evidence"). The Supreme Court explained the importance of findings in a seminal 1974 case as

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 39 -

1 follows:

2 [A] findings requirement serves to conduce the administrative body to draw legally relevant sub-

3 conclusions supportive of its ultimate decision; the intended effect is to facilitate orderly analysis and minimize the likelihood that the agency will randomly leap from evidence to conclusions.

4 Topanga Association for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles (*Topanga") (1974) 11 Cal.3d

5 506, 516. Thus, pursuant to CCP section 1094.5, judicial review of the Board's Project Approvals

6 extends not only to whether the Project and Project Approvals are consistent with the County General

7 Plan and Zoning Ordinance as a matter of law, but also to (1) whether the Board made the requisite

8 findings, and (2) whether those findings are supported by the evidence.

9 113. Here, because the Project does not comply with the County General Plan and Zoning

10 Ordinance, and because the Board failed to make the requisite findings of compliance supported by

11 substantial evidence, the Board lacked the authority to approve the Project and its Project Approvals

12 were ultra vires. Any "permit action taken without compliance with the hierarchy of land use laws is

13 ultra vires." Neighborhood, 156 Cal.App.3d at 1184.

14 114. The Project would violate the County's General Plan and Zoning Ordinance in several

15 ways. First, it violates the County General Plan's designation of the Project site as a Specific Plan Area.
16 According to the County Planning Commission, "[a] Specific Plan envisions a multi-use concept that

17 may contain residential, commercial, industrial, public institutional and open space uses." San Diego

18 County Planning Commission Hearing Report for the Project dated July 9, 2021, at 3-8. But no Specific
19 Plan authorizing the Project has been adopted for this site. Hence the Project's approval is premature

20 and ultra vires.

21 115. Second, it violates the General Plan's requirement that at this site at this time, at least two
22 additional approvals would be needed - a General Plan Amendment, and a Rezone. The County openly
23 admitted, at least initially, that these additional approvals are needed. The County had maintained,

24 correctly, that "[t]he Project originally included a General Plan Amendment, Rezone, and Major Use

25 Permit (MUP) for an up to 90MW energy [sic] solar energy generation and storage facility as described

26 in the Notice of Preparation (NOP) for the EIR." Id. at 3-3 (emphasis added). But "[s]ubsequent to the
27 NOP public review period," all that changed. Id. Rather than provide the full analysis of the Project's
28 long-term impacts as applicable law requires, the County claimed in releasing its DEIR that "the General

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees . 40 -

1 Plan Amendment and Rezone applications were determined [to] not be needed, and therefore

2 subsequently withdrawn." Id. The Planning Commission stated:

3 "[f]or purposes of the environmental review under CEQA, the Project is considered an interim

4 use rather than a permanent use in the EIR because the solar facility will be required to provide a bonded agreement to ensure decommissioning and will be conditioned to remove all of its

5 components after its operational use. . . Since the Project is considered an interim use, it is allowed in the Specific Planning Area Land Use Designation upon approval of an MUP and a General Plan Amendment and Rezone are not required. Therefore, the Project in the Draft EIR 6 only included an MUP.'

7 Id. (emphasis added).

8 116. In particular, the Planning Commission asserted that "[p]ursuant to Section 2888(a) of the

9 County Zoning Ordinance, a [sic] MUP may be granted on this site for any use pursuant to a bonded

10 agreement, such as a decommissioning plan, that ensures the removal of all structures and associated

11 electrical components within a specified amount of time . . .." Id. (emphasis added). Based solely on

12 this provision of its Zoning Ordinance, the County effectively sought to bypass the requirement for a

13 General Plan Amendment that is imbedded in the fundamental hierarchy of California's Planning and

14 Zoning Law.

15 117. As a general law jurisdiction, San Diego County's planning, zoning and permitting
16 decisions must comply with the state Planning and Zoning Law (Government Code section 65000 et

17 seq.). That means that the County may not evade its duties under its General Plan by relying on contrary

18 provisions of its Zoning Ordinance. As explained above, it has been settled law for nearly four decades

19 that

20 a use permit is struck from the mold of the zoning law ([Government Code section] 65901) [and]

21 the zoning law must comply with the adopted general plan (§ 65860). .. The validity of the permit process derives from compliance with this hierarchy of planning laws. . . . A permit action

22 taken without compliance with the hierarchy of land use laws is ultra vires as to any defect implicated by the uses sought by the permit.

23

24 Neighborhood Action Group V. County of Calaveras, supra, 156 Cal.App.3d at 1184 (emphasis added);

25 accord, Government Code section 65860(a) ("County or city zoning ordinances shall be consistent with

26 the general plan of the county or city by January 1, 1974.").

118.
27 The County's attempted reformulation of the scope and depth of the environmental and

28 planning review required for this Project sidestepped all analysis of the Project's long-term impacts.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 41 -

1 Abruptly and unlawfully, based solely on this recasting of the Project as merely a "temporary use, the

2 County attempted to avoid the contrary requirements of both the Planning and Zoning Law and, as noted

3 above, CEQA.

4 119. Even if the County had authority to brush aside the requirements of its General Plan SO

5 casually - which it manifestly it does not - its attempt to do so here would not withstand scrutiny. For one,

6 the Project is not a mere "temporary use." As explained previously, the Project creates a permanent

7 Swichyard for the transfer of large amounts of energy from industrial-scale renewable energy projects.

8 Upon completion, that Switchyard will become the property of SDG&E, and be subject solely to the
9 jurisdiction of the CPUC. It will remain on site indefinitely, and there is nothing the County can ever do

10 to unravel its unlawful creation of this permanent industrial use within the Jacumba Specific Plan Area.

11 Consequently, it is indisputably a permanent, not "temporary," use.

12 120. For another, the Project would set in motion over the next 35 years a series of land use

13 changes whose effects would not end just because the Project might be decommissioned at the

14 conclusion of that period. These land use changes - like the proverbial bell that cannot be "unrung" -

15 will be permanent and will effectively preclude restoration of Jacumba's once-thriving local economy

16 and community in several ways. First, the Project would remove all remaining dairy and ranch structures

17 from the site's historically productive farmland. Second, it would preempt the site's development for

18 uses compatible with revitalization of Jacumba as a self-sufficient community that protect, enhance and

19 promote its natural scenery, wildlife habitat, hot springs, and recreational opportunities by walling it off.
20 Third, it would instead bulldoze, de-vegetate, and enclose within a high security fence the site's former

21 agricultural and adjacent lands with an ugly, hazardous and wildlife-intolerant industrial landscape.

22 121. For another example, the resulting wholesale displacement of wildlife caused by this

23 Project's massive construction will not suddenly end just because the Project might be decommissioned

24 more than three decades in the future. The record reveals that 500 construction workers would be

25 simultaneously engaged in the task of eradicating all vestiges of the existing environment with a mile- a

26 square zone of topographic reconfiguration, leveling, grading and miles of exclusionary perimeter

27 fencing. No wildlife habitat will survive that concerted onslaught. Wildlife use of habitat, migration,

28 and survival are not static events that one can turn on and off like an electrical switch. For the imperiled

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and Attorneys' Fees - 42 -

1 species, their continued downward spiral toward extinction would be hastened, not placed on hold, by

2 the removal of this huge swath of habitat. They cannot wait 35 years for the opportunity to once again
3 graze, drink, nest, reproduce, migrate with the seasons, and use their habitat in all the complex and

4 interrelated ways that they do to survive. They require continued access to the Project site each and

5 every day, not just 35 years' hence.

6 122. Likewise, the Project's destruction of the scenery along Old Highway 80 that prompted its

7 a designation as a Scenic Highway as discussed previously contravenes as well the County's duty to

8 comply with and implement its Subregional Plan's designation of Old Highway 80 as a scenic highway.

9 123. Further, the Project violates the County's General Plan Conservation and Open Space

10 Element. That element provides in Policy 18.3, entitled "Alternative Energy System Impacts, " that the

11 County must "[r]equire alternative energy system operation to properly design and maintain these

12 systems to minimize adverse impacts to the environment." Id. (emphasis added).

13 124. Contrary to this General Plan requirement, the County's approval of the Project does not
14 "minimize adverse impacts to the environment." For example, the Project eradicates all habitat on the

15 one-mile square of the Project site. And, as noted above, it poses immense wildfire risks, both by
16 increasing the risk of fire ignition and by impeding wildfire fighting. These impacts violate the County

17 General Plan's mandate that alternative energy systems must "minimize adverse impacts to the

18 environment."

19 125. Finally, the Project violates the County Zoning Ordinance as the County admitted in its
20 approval documents. The FEIR, like many other County reviews of the Project, concedes that the

21 Project is not consistent with the Zoning Ordinance, stating that "[a]fter decommissioning, the land

22 would have to return to a land use that is consistent with the County of San Diego zoning ordinance at

23 the time of decommissioning." FEIR at p. 1-21 (emphasis added).

24 126. For each of the foregoing reasons, the Project Approvals violate the Planning and Zoning
25 Law. Because the Project does not comply with the County General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, and
26 because the Board failed to make the requisite findings of compliance supported by substantial evidence,

27 the Board lacked the authority to approve the Project and its Project Approvals are therefore ultra vires

28 and must be set aside.

22 I, Stephan C. Volker, am the attorney for petitioners in this action. I make this verification on

23 behalf of the petitioners because they are absent from the county in which my office is located. I have

24 read the foregoing Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive
