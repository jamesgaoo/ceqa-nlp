VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

Petitioners and Plaintiffs INTEGRAL ASSOCIATES DENA, LLC (*Integral") and
2 HARVEST OF PASADENA, LLC (*Harvest"; and collectively, "Plaintiffs") allege as follows.

3 INTRODUCTION

4 1. This action challenges the recent amendment of the Municipal Code ("Municipal
5 Code") for the City of Pasadena ("City") to allow more than one cannabis retailer within a city

6 council district and to reduce the number of feet within which a cannabis retailer can be established

7 of another cannabis retailer ("Zoning Code Amendment"l). Plaintiffs seek to enjoin its
8 implementation and enforcement, to invalidate it, and to require environmental review under the

9 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").

10 2. The Zoning Code Amendment is in flagrant disregard of the will and intent of the

11 voters who passed Measure CC. Measure CC repealed the City's ban on commercial cannabis
12 activity. It also limited the number of commercial cannabis businesses to 6 retailers. Furthermore,
13 Measure CC only allowed one dispensary in each city council district, and required a minimum of
14 1,000 feet between cannabis retailers.

15 3. In adopting the amendment, the City found that the project - that is, the Zoning Code
16 Amendment - was exempt from CEQA review. However, in so doing, the City erred as a matter of a
17 law in applying those exemptions, failed to evaluate and consider significant environmental impacts

18 of the project, and failed to make findings supported by substantial evidence.

19 4. The Zoning Code Amendment is contrary to the voters' understanding and intent
20 when they passed Measure CC, which was designed to avoid overconcentration of commercial

21 cannabis retailers in any one council district by requiring them to be spread throughout the City.
22 Allowing the Zoning Code Amendment to take effect and be implemented violates the specific
23 expressed intent of Measure CC and defeats public policy and constitutes grave injustice to the

24 public.

25

26
The amendment changed 3 sections in Title 17 of the Municipal Code (i.e., the Zoning Code), and 27 also changed 1 section in Title 5 of the Municipal Code to grant applicants for a cannabis permit an a additional twenty-four (24) month period to secure such a permit. Plaintiffs object to the change in 28 Title 5, as well as the changes to Title 17 in the Zoning Code.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

5. Plaintiffs have obtained all necessary permits and licenses to operate their cannabis

2 retail stores in the City pursuant to the original commercial cannabis regulations enacted in the
3 Municipal Code pursuant to Measure CC. Integral has opened its store, and is conducting business
4 in Council District 7, while Harvest is completing the build-out of its facility and will shortly open
5 its dispensary for business in Council District 3.

6 6. In obtaining their permits and licenses, Plaintiffs complied with all of the original
7 commercial cannabis regulations enacted in the Municipal Code pursuant to Measure CC and relied

8 on them in good faith. Plaintiffs invested significant financial resources in the process, including

9 but not limited to, going through rigorous City procedures to obtain the requisite permits and
10 licenses, acquiring real estate for their retail stores, providing social equity benefits to the City, and
11 defending themselves and the City from numerous lawsuits directly related to the City's cannabis
12 program.

13 7. The Zoning Code Amendment deprives Plaintiffs of their investment-backed
14 expectations of being the one and only cannabis retailer in their respective Council District, and of
15 being more than 1,000 feet of another cannabis retailer, and has deprived Plaintiffs of the
16 opportunity and right to operate their stores accordingly.

17 I.

18 THE PARTIES

19 8. Plaintiff INTEGRAL ASSOCIATES DENA, LLC is a California limited liability
20 company that is in the business of commercial cannabis retail and has obtained a Conditional Use

21 a Permit ("CUP"), a commercial cannabis permit, and a building permit for its retail store in the City.

22 9. Plaintiff HARVEST OF PASADENA, LLC is a California limited liability company
23 that is in the business of commercial cannabis retail and has obtained a CUP, a commercial cannabis
24 permit, and a building permit for its retail store in the City.

25 10. Defendant and Respondent CITY OF PASADENA is a Charter City in California.
26 Defendant and Respondent CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF PASADENA (*City Council"),
27 comprised of seven elected members and the elected Mayor, governs the City and is responsible for

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 passing ordinances, among other things. Collectively, these defendants and respondents are referred
2 hereinafter as the "City."

3 11. Plaintiffs are unaware of the true names of DOES 1 through 25, who are also

4 responsible for and proximately caused the matters alleged in this Petition and Complaint; therefore,

5 Plaintiffs sue those Defendants and Respondents by fictitious names. Plaintiffs will amend this

6 Petition and Complaint to allege their true names and capacities when they are ascertained.

7 12. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that at all times
8 mentioned in this Complaint and Petition, DOES 1 through 25 were the agents of the City, and in

9 doing the things alleged in this Petition and Complaint, were acting within the course and scope of
10 that agency. The City, and DOES 1 through 25 are collectively referred to as "Defendants."

11 II.

12 JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND RIGHTS AFFECTING PUBLIC INTEREST

13 13. Pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure § § 1085 and 1094.5 and Public
14 Resources Code §§ 21168, 21168.5, and 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of
15 mandate requiring review and compliance under CEQA and to invalidate the Zoning Code

16 | Amendment.

17 14. Venue is proper in this Court because the environmental impacts of the Zoning Code
18 Amendment will impact the City, which is within the County of Los Angeles. Cal. Civ. Proc. Code

19 § 393. Venue is also proper in this Court, because the action is against the City, which is in the
20 County of Los Angeles. Cal. Civ. Proc. Code §§ 394, 395.

21 15. This Petition and Complaint is timely filed within 35 days of the City's Notice of
22 Exemption, filed November 9, 2021. Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 21167(d).

23 16. Plaintiffs have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant action

24 and have exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law under Public Resources
25 Code § 21177. Plaintiffs and/or other individuals raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in
26 this Petition and Complaint orally and/or in writing during the City's decision-making process.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

17. The violations by Defendants as alleged herein have affected the beneficial interests

2 of Plaintiffs. The relief sought in this Petition and Complaint will redress these beneficial interests
3 and the likelihood of future injury and interference with Plaintiffs' interests.

4 18. Plaintiffs have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
5 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require the City to comply with CEQA and
6 to invalidate the Zoning Code Amendment. In the absence of such remedies, the City's decisions

7 will remain in effect in violation of CEQA to the detriment of Plaintiffs.

8 19. This proceeding involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public

9 interest. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition and Complaint will confer a significant
10 benefit on the public, including citizens, residents, businesses, and taxpayers of the City, and will
11 result in the enforcement of important public rights by requiring the City to comply with CEQA and
12 other legal requirements applicable to the Zoning Code Amendment, by setting aside and
13 invalidating the approval of the Zoning Code Amendment, and prohibiting Defendants from taking
14 further actions with respect to the Zoning Code Amendment until the City has complied with those
15 legal requirements.

16 20. Plaintiffs are entitled to recover attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
17 § 1021.5 if they prevail in this case. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement of these
18 public rights entitles Plaintiffs to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees.

19 III.

20 GENERAL SUBSTANTIVE ALLEGATIONS

21 A. CEQA Framework

22 21. CEQA a is a comprehensive scheme designed to provide long-term protection to the
23 environment. In enacting CEQA, the California Legislature declared its intention that all public
24 agencies responsible for regulating activities affecting the environment give prime consideration to
25 preventing environmental damage when carrying out their duties. See Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 21001.

26 22. The California Supreme Court has stated that CEQA is to be interpreted to afford the
27 fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors of Santa Barbara Cnty. (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 563-

2 64.

3 23. Generally, CEQA applies to discretionary projects. A "project" is an activity

4 undertaken by a public agency "which may cause either a direct physical change in the
5 environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment." Cal. Pub.
6 Res. Code § 21065. Amendments of a zoning ordinance may fall within the statutory definition of
7 "project" triggering CEQA review. Union of Medical Marijuana Patients, Inc. V. City of San Diego
8 (2019) 7 Cal.5th 1171, 1191-92.

9 24. If a public agency proposes to approve a discretionary project, the agency's activity
10 may nonetheless be exempt from CEQA by legislative command. Other classes of projects are
11 "categorically exempt" from CEQA pursuant to administrative regulation because they do not have
12 a significant effect on the environment. A "[s]ignificant effect on the environment" is "a substantial
13 or potentially substantial, adverse change in the environment." Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 21068.

14 25. Whenever : project may have a significant and adverse physical effect on the
15 I environment, an environmental impact report ("EIR") must be prepared and certified. Cal. Pub.
16 Res. Code § 21100(a).

17 26. The EIR has been described as the "heart of CEQA." Citizens of Goleta Valley,
18 supra, 52 Cal. 3d at p. 564. "Its purpose is to inform the public and its responsible officials of the
19 environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR 'protects not
20 only the environment but also informed self-government.' " Id. (emphasis in original).
21 Specifically, an EIR is an informational document which shall be considered by every public
22 agency prior to its approval or disapproval of a project.

23 27. The purpose of an EIR is: to provide public agencies and the public in general with
24 detailed information about the effect which a proposed project is likely to have on the environment;

25 to list ways in which the significant effects of such a project might be minimized; and to indicate
26 alternatives to such a project. Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 21061.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

B. Initial Consideration of Zoning Code Amendments Affecting Commercial Cannabis

2 Activity.

3 28. On November 13, 2019, the Planning Commission considered the City staff's

4 recommendation for an ordinance reducing the distance required between cannabis retailers from

5 1,000 feet to 450 feet, and increasing the maximum permitted cannabis retailers per council district

6 from 1 to 3. The Planning Commission voted 6-1-1 (Commissioner Donald Nanney abstaining) to

7 recommend no change to the existing language allowing only one cannabis retailer per council

8 district and requiring 1,000 feet separation between cannabis retailers. In announcing her vote,

9 against the motion to amend the ordinance, Commissioner Blair Miller commented that as passed
10 by the voters, Measure CC "clearly [had] an intent to spread them [the cannabis dispensaries]
11 around." Commissioner Steven Olivas supported the view of the other commissioners that the
12 proposed language went too far when he stated, "This notion of voter intent is really difficult . .. I
13 do think the council district requirement is very clear I have a problem with three of them being
14 in one district."

15 29. Despite the Planning Commission's November 13, 2019 vote, on November 25,
16 2019, the City Manager recommended that the City Council direct the City Attorney's Office to
17 prepare an ordinance to amend the Zoning Code consistent with the proposal to allow up to three
18 cannabis retailers per council district, and to decrease the required distance between cannabis

19 retailers from 1,000 feet to 450 feet.

20 30. The November 25 Report asserted:

21 Based on the applications that have been received from the top-six, if the two
22 amendments are adopted, there could be three code [compliant] locations in Council District 3, one at 169 W. Colorado Boulevard, another at 70 W. Union

23 Street and a third at 827 E. Colorado Boulevard. There would also potentially be . . . one location in Council District 7 at 908 E. Colorado Boulevard. The

24 closest distance between retailers based on these locations is between SweetFlower Pasadena (827 E. Colorado Boulevard) and Integral Associates Dena, LLC (908

25 a E. Colorado) at a distance of approximately 475 feet.

26 31. The November 25 Report also stated, when considering the Zoning Code
27 Amendment, "[s]ome members of the Planning Commission expressed concerns . .. about making
28 changes to regulations that are voter approved. In this regard, it is important to note voters

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

authorized the City Council to make changes to these regulations in the manner in which other
2  ordinances are amended."

3 32. With regard to the environmental analysis of the Zoning Code Amendment, the
4 November 25 Report stated that "the amendment of a zoning ordinance will not constitute a CEQA

5 project unless it also may cause either a direct a physical change in the environment, or a reasonably
6 foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment." Specifically, as applied to the Zoning
7 Code Amendment, the November 25 Report claimed:

8 Because the baseline condition provides for six retail locations, and the location

9 requirement changes set forth herein are relatively minor in terms of potential for a significant environmental effect (but important changes nonetheless), the

10 proposed action is exempt from the CEQA pursuant to State CEQA Guidelines Section 15061(b)(3), the common sense exemption that CEQA applies only to
11 projects which have the potential for causing a significant effect on the environment. Even if the changes proposed herein were considered a "project,'
12 the changes are exempt from CEQA pursuant to State CEQA Guidelines Section 15301 "Existing Facilities" (Class 1). . . . Given the built-out commercial and mixed

13 use areas of the City where these uses may locate, and the fact that the changes proposed herein do not expand those areas, it is virtually certain that such uses will

14 reoccupy existing structures. Beyond the controversy that may surround this particular use, for environmental analysis purposes it is simply a retail use, and there

15 are no unique circumstances that would exempt these changes from a Class
exemption.

16 33. The November 25 Report concluded: "The proposed changes to the ordinance may
17 result in additional cannabis retailers than would otherwise be allowed under current regulations.
18 This would likely result in additional tax revenues from Measure DD in the hundreds of thousands
19 of dollars."

20 34. At the November 25, 2019 City Council meeting, Councilmember Kennedy

21 expressed serious reservations with the proposed amendment that would allow up to three cannabis
22 operators in any single council district, and Councilmember Wilson stated his concern that the
23| proposed changes would result in an overconcentration of cannabis operators. Councilmember
24 Gordo spoke about the importance of the separation requirements, which he believed contributed
25 greatly to the adoption of Measure CC. Councilmember Masuda stated his strong preference to
26 maintain the one cannabis retailer operator per council district limit. Accordingly, the City Council
27 did not recommend changes to the regulations at that time, but directed City staff to return to the
28 City Council after three stores were operational.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

C. Renewed Consideration of the Zoning Code Amendment

2 35. In the April 12, 2021 Agenda Report from the City Manager to the City Council, the
3 City Manager once again recommended that the City Council vote for the Zoning Code
4 Amendment, characterizing it as a "fair and equitable way of . . . carry[ing] out the will of the votersi

5 and would allow the remaining two applicants to move forward and obtain cannabis permits."

6 SweetFlower Pasadena, LLC ("SweetFlower") and The Atrium Group, LLC ("Atrium") are the
7 remaining two applicants. The City Council agreed to send the matter to the Economic
8 Development and Technology Committee of the City of Pasadena ("EDTECH").

9 36. The City staff's memorandum dated July 15, 2021 noted that the changes in the
10 Zoning Code Amendment would allow the remaining two applicants, SweetFlower and Atrium, to
11 locate at their proposed locations.

12 37. At its July 15, 2021 meeting, EDTECH considered the Zoning Code Amendment,
13 stating that the City's distance separation requirements "far exceed the state requirements and were
14 established several years ago before any legal dispensaries were operating." EDTECH noted that
15 the two dispensaries that are operating in the City "have not resulted in negative impacts or any
16 code compliance violations," and concluded that "it may be appropriate to amend existing
17 regulations to align with the state requirements."

18 38. At the July 21, 2021 meeting, EDTECH voted unanimously to recommend the
19 Zoning Code Amendment to the full City Council.
20 D. City Council's Decision to Adopt the Zoning Code Amendment

21 39. In the August 9, 2021 Agenda Report to the City Council (*August 9 Report"), the
22 City Manager reiterated the recommendation that the City Council vote for the Zoning Code
23 Amendment. The August 9 Report also recommended that the proposed actions be found exempt
24 from "the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section

25 15061(b)(3) (Common Sense Exemption); and 15301 (Existing Facilities); there are no features that
26 distinguish this action from others in the exempt class, and there are no unique circumstances."

27 40. At the August 9, 2021 public hearing, letters and emails in support of and in
28 opposition to the City staff recommendation were distributed to the City Council.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

41. The City Manager, the City Director of Planning and Community Development, and

2 the Chair of the EDTECH made presentations to the City Council.

3 42. Comments and suggestions were also provided by individuals representing cannabis

4 permit applicants and by City residents.

5 43. Councilmember Kennedy expressed strong concerns with the staff recommendation,
6 describing the work as "shoddy," resulting in the possibility of three cannabis retailers operating in
7 City Council District 3 and an overconcentration in that district. Councilmember Kennedy
8 advocated for cannabis retailers to be permitted throughout the City rather than concentrated in one

9 council district. Councilmember Masuda echoed concerns raised by Councilmember Kennedy and
10 opposed the recommendation that would allow for more than one cannabis retailer per city council

11 district.

12 44. At the close of the public hearing, the City Council voted 5-3 to adopt the Zoning
13 Code Amendment. The Zoning Code Amendment changes, among others, the following provisions
14 of Chapter 17.50 of the Zoning Code:

15 a. Section 17.50.066.D, subsection 3, is amended to provide "[n]o more than three

16 (3) retailers may operate within a city council district at any one time" instead of

17 the prior limit of one (1) retailer within a city council district at any one time;

18 b. Section 17.50.066.D, subsection 5, is amended to provide that "[n]o retailer shall

19 be established or located within 450 feet, measured from the nearest property

20 lines of each of the affected parcels, of any other cannabis retailer or within
21 1,000 feet of any cultivation site, or within 500 feet of any testing laboratory"

22 instead of the prior limit of "[n]o retailer shall be established or located within

23 1,000 feet, measured from the nearest property lines of each of the affected

24 parcels, of any other cannabis retailer or cultivation site, or within 500 feet of any

25 testing laboratory."

26 45. The Findings for the Zoning Code Amendment included the following:

27 a. "The General Plan encourages that sufficient land is available to provide a broad

28 range of uses within the City's commercial corridors and there are diversity of

10

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

I uses offered. Cannabis retail is a retail use that is allowed in five different zones

2 of the City. If a location is proposed that meets the applicable code provisions

3 the cannabis retail use is in conformance with the General Plan as a retail use,

4 and it introduces a new land use to diversify the retail landscape within the city's

5 commercial corridors which is specifically encouraged in Policy 4.2 (A Diversity

6 of Places) and Goal 25.1 (A Diversity of Uses)."

7 b. "The proposed amendments are consistent with various policies in the Land Use

8 Element of the General Plan. The proposed changes to the location

9 requirements do not change to allowable zones for the retail cannabis use

10 which are the CO, CL, CG, CD, and IG zoning districts, and the amendments

11 also include clean-up to language that was codified incorrectly related to distance

12 requirements for lab uses only. The amendments do not change the overall

13 number of locations allowed in the City and they do not change any other

14 distance separation requirements including the distance to sensitive uses and

15 residential zoning districts. The amendments do not change the permitting

16 process or any other operating requirements contained in the Municipal Code that

17 will regulate a cannabis retailer that is successful in securing a Cannabis Permit.

18 Therefore, the proposed amendments would not be detrimental to the public

19 interest, health, safety, convenience, or general welfare of the City."

20 46. In the Ordinance Fact Sheet dated October 25, 2021 (*Ordinance Fact Sheet"), the

21 City Attorney characterized the proposed ordinance as modifying "the distance separation and limit

22 per district of cannabis retail sites," correcting "distance separation errors in the Zoning Code
23 applicable to cannabis labs," and increasing "the time to obtain a cannabis permit."

24 47. The Ordinance Fact Sheet further states that "[t)his legislation is needed to allow for
25 additional potential sites at which a cannabis retail use may be established. The decrease in
26 separation distance and the increase of up to three sites per council district will open up additional
27 potential sites. The cap of six permits across the city will remain, SO that the absolute potential
28 number of retailers will not increase. This legislation is also needed to correct an error in the

11

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

distance separation from cannabis labs and other cannabis uses, to make them consistent with other
2 similar separation requirements. Finally, this legislation is necessary to increase the time within

3 which an applicant may obtain a cannabis permit given the time it will take to process applications

4 at the increased potential sites."

5 48. On October 25, 2021, the City Council conducted the First Reading of the "Cannabis
6 Ordinance Amendments," which effectuate the Zoning Code Amendment. The First Reading passed

7 on a 5-3 vote.

8 49. On November 1, 2021, the City Council conducted the Second Reading of the

9 Cannabis Ordinance Amendments. The Cannabis Ordinance Amendments were adopted by the
10 City Council with a 5-3 vote.

11 50. On November 9, 2021, the City filed a Notice of Exemption (*NOE"), stating that
12 the "project" - that is, the Zoning Code Amendment - is exempt from CEQA pursuant to
13 Categorical Exemption 1 (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14, § 15301 (existing facilities)) and the Common
14 Sense Exemption (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14, § 15061(b)(3)).

15 51. The NOE asserts: "Cannabis retail and cannabis laboratories are conditionally
16 permitted uses, subject to a separate environmental review once a proposed code-compliant site is
17 identified. No physical changes to the environment are proposed as part of this amendment."

18 52. The NOE further states: "There are no features that distinguish this project from

19 others in the exempt class; therefore, there are no unusual circumstances. . . . A Conditional Use
20 Permit application is required once a proposed location is identified, at which point the proposed
21 locations will be evaluated. Finally, the proposed project would not contribute to any significant
22 cumulative impacts that have occurred as a result of successive projects of the same type in the
23 same place, over time."

24 53. The NOE also claims that there is "no possibility that the activity in question may
25 have a significant impact on the environment. . . [where] the proposed zoning code amendment,
26 which is limited to correcting a previous error and changing the distance separation requirement
27| between cannabis establishments, without allowing for any more cannabis establishments citywide
28 that [sic] currently allowed."

12

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

54. The NOE concludes: "[T]he proposed code amendment would not entitle any
2 cannabis uses and adoption of the amendment, itself, would not result in any physical changes in the
3 environment, as cannabis retail and cannabis laboratories would remain conditionally permitted

4 uses, subject to a separate discretionary approval and environmental review process once a
5 proposed code-compliant site is identified."

6 IV.

7 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

8 VIOLATION OF CEQA; ZONING CODE AMENDMENT DOES NOT COMPLY WITH CEQA

9 55. Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 54, as though
10 fully set-forth herein.

11 56. CEQA, Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq., requires the lead agency for a project
12 to prepare an EIR, initial study, or mitigated negative declaration that complies with the
13 requirements of the statute. The lead agency also must provide for public review and comment on
14 the project and associated environmental documentation. An EIR, initial study, or mitigated
15 negative declaration must provide an adequate project description and sufficient environmental
16 analysis such that decision makers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when
17 acting on the proposed project.

18 57. CEQA also requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of the project be
19 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. See Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 21168.5.
20 CEQA further requires that a lead agency provide an explanation of how evidence in the record

21 supports the conclusions it has reached.

22 58. The City violated CEQA by determining that the Zoning Code Amendment, that is,
23 the project, was exempt from CEQA review pursuant to Categorical Exemption 1 (Cal. Code Regs.

24 tit. 14, § 15301 (existing facilities)) and the Common Sense Exemption (Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14,

25 co 15061(b)(3)), rather than conducting a sufficient environmental analysis, including but not limited
26 to, analysis of changes in patterns of vehicle traffic from the cannabis businesses' customers,
27 employees, and suppliers, and of patterns of urban development in the City. These exemptions do
28 not apply as a matter of law.

13

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

59. The City further violated CEQA by adopting findings for the Zoning Code
2 Amendment that are inadequate as a matter of law as they are not supported by substantial evidence
3 in the record, including but not limited to, the following:

4 a. The finding that the "proposed changes to the location requirements do not

5 change to allowable zones for the retail cannabis use which are the CO, CL, CG,

6 CD, and IG zoning districts" is not supported by substantial evidence because

7 there are no longer any CO, CL, CG, CD, and IG zoning districts under the

8 City's General Plan;

9 b. The finding that "the proposed amendments would not be detrimental to the

10 public interest, health, safety, convenience, or general welfare of the City" is not

11 supported by any evidence, let alone substantial evidence. The City failed to

12 provide any explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions

13 it has reached.

14 60. As a result of the foregoing violations and others according to proof, the City
15 prejudicially abused its discretion by exempting the project, i.e., the Zoning Code Amendment,
16 from environmental review under CEQA, and by approving the project in reliance thereon.

17 61. a As a result of the foregoing defects, the City also prejudicially abused its discretion
18 by making determinations or adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA
19 and approving the project in reliance thereon.

20 V.

21 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

22 WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

23 CAL. CIV. PROC. CODE §§ 1085 & 1094.5

24 62. Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 61, as though
25 fully set-forth herein.

26 63. A writ should issue requiring the City to: (1) complete environmental review in
27 compliance with CEQA; and (2) set aside and invalidate the City's Ordinance approving the Zoningl
28 Code Amendment, because the City has proceeded in excess of its jurisdiction by applying two

14

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

inapplicable CEQA Guideline exemptions, and making findings in support of the Zoning Code
2 Amendment that are not supported by substantial evidence.

3 64. Plaintiffs have beneficial interest in setting aside and invalidating the City's
4 Ordinance approving the Zoning Code Amendment and findings in support of the Zoning Code
5 Amendments. These decisions interfere with Plaintiffs' beneficial interests in the CUP, commercial

6 cannabis permit, and building permit for their retail stores in the City and Plaintiffs' vested right to

7 operate the stores without another cannabis retailer in the same council district or within 1,000 feet

8 of its location.

9 65. Plaintiffs have exhausted the available administrative remedies required to be
10 pursued. Plaintiffs do not have a plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law,

11 and therefore writ relief is necessary.

12 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

13 Wherefore, Plaintiffs pray for judgment as follows:

14 1. For a finding that the City violated CEQA;

15 2. For a peremptory writ of mandate commanding the City Council to set aside

16 and invalidate the Ordinance approving the Zoning Code Amendment as well

17 as the Zoning Code Amendment, and to require the City to complete the full

18 CEQA environmental review and public comment period as required by law;

19 3. For an alternative writ against the City;

20 4. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and

21 permanent injunctions enjoining the City and their agents, employees,

22 officers, or representatives, and all persons acting in concert or participating

23 with the City, from taking any action to implement the Zoning Code

24 Amendment, unless and until the City fully complies with CEQA;

25 5. For costs of suit and attorney's fees pursuant to California Government Code

26 cop 800, Code of Civil Procedure § 1021, Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5;

27 and

28 6. For such other relief as the Court deems proper.
