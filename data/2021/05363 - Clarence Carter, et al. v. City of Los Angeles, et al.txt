First Amended Petition & Complaint

ad Plaintiffs and Petitioners Clarence Carter and the Venice Neighbors Coalition
2 (collectively, "Plaintiffs") allege:

3

4 1. FACTS APPLICABLE TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION

The Project and Plaintiffs. This case concerns the City of Los Angeles and its
5 subsidiary entities' ("the City's") plan to eliminate an affordable neighborhood Ramada Inn in

6 the Los Angeles special coastal neighborhood of Venice and replace it with a homeless shelter
7 be licensed for a minimum 55-year period. Hereafter, this proposal is referred to as "the to

8 Project." The City has inappropriately labeled the Project as an "emergency" response to the

9 COVID-19 pandemic and the alleged homelessness crisis. However, the pandemic emergency is
10  now over, and the City's Mayor has directly asserted that the protracted situation of homeless
11| individuals residing in Los Angeles is not an "emergency," and there is no justification for
12 attempting to exempt the Project from the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), the
13 Coastal Act, or other applicable laws.

14 2. Plaintiff Clarence Carter is a resident of Venice, a member of the Venice
15 Neighborhood Council, and a member of the ad hoc neighborhood group Families First Venice

16

17 and the subsequently-formed Venice Neighbors Coalition ("Coalition").

3. Plaintiff Coalition is an unincorporated association comprised of some of the
18 more than 400 local neighbors and businesses who opposed this proposed Project based on the
19 significant impacts to aesthetics, public safety, and public and environmental health effects from
20 the facility, and from the inevitable homeless encampments that will sprout up around the 33-
21 room facility, with the concomitant predicatble increase in crime including violent crime, fires,

22

23 and unsanitary conditions based on the community's experience from another Venice shelter
operated by the same service provider.

24 4. Plaintiff Carter and more than 400 members of the community were individually
25 identified and listed as appellants on the administrative appeal heard before Respondent and
26 Defendant Board of Public Works on April 14, 2021. Plaintiff Coalition was subsequently
27 formed to include these commenters pursuant to CEQA, Public Resources Code section

28

First Amended Petition & Complaint 2

21177(c), to the extent that section applies. Plaintiffs and the local community who will be
2 impacted by this Project overwhelmingly oppose it.

3 5. Plaintiffs bring this action on behalf of the neighborhood and the general public,
4 and act as a private attorney general to confer a significant benefit on the general public or a
5 large class of persons under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

6 6. The City considered this Project in March and April of 2021. It filed its Notice of
7 Exemption with the State's ceqanet database on April 28, 2021, and this case is therefore timely
8 under CEQA in compliance with Governor Newsom's COVID-19 emergency Executive Orders

9 N-54-20 and N-80-20, which applied because the Los Angeles County Clerk's Office was closed
10 and the County Clerk was legally required to physically post notices "in the office of the county

11 clerk" pursuant to CEQA, Pub. Res. Code § 21152(c) and Guidelines 15062(c)(2).

12 7.• The location of the Project is at 3130 Washington Blvd., Los Angeles, CA. 90292,
13 at the former site of a Ramada Inn. Using taxpayer money, the City paid for the purchase of the

14 Ramada Inn for use as a homeless shelter pursuant to various agreements with Real Party in
15 Interest, People Assisting the Homeless ("PATH'),. Pursuant to one of those agreements, PATH
16 was supposedly to repay the City for the purchase of the property, although the terms of that
17 repayment, which the public and taxpayers clearly have an interest in seeing, are nowhere
18 recorded. The City also awarded PATH a long-term contract worth many millions of dollars to
19 operate the facility.

20 8. The Ramada Inn is located in the working class, diverse residential neighborhood
21 of President's Row and the Oxford Triangle. This neighborhood is full of families, children,

22 senior citizens, and disabled persons, and home to two elementary schools and five preschools.

23 9. The City did not engage in any community outreach or notify the local
24 community prior to its purchase of the Ramada. Members of the community only learned of the

25 Project after a contractor hired by the City or PATH mentioned the a Project to a local resident the
26 contractor happened to know.

27 10. On or around January 2021, Respondent and Defendant City of Los Angeles'
28 Councilman Mike Bonin's Deputy Chief of Staff, Krista Kline, completed an application for a
First Amended Petition & Complaint 3

F Coastal Development Permit ("CDP") on behalf of the City. With almost no public notice,
2 Respondent and Defendant Bureau of Engineering then approved the CDP. Plaintiff Carter and
3 Families First Venice filed an administrative appeal, and Respondent and Defendant Board of
4 Public Works then upheld the CDP without even giving notice to the appellants. Despite the

5 lack of adequate public notice, community opposition to the City's proposed Project throughout

6 the administrative process was overwhelming.

7 11. Throughout the administrative process, the City engaged in multiple and repeated
8 due process violations to the detriment of Plaintiffs and the public at large.

9 12. Respondents and Defendants, and Real Parties in Interest._Defendant and

10 Respondent City of Los Angeles is a municipal corporation which has sponsored the Project.

11 City is also a Real Party in Interest.

12 13. Defendant and Respondent the City of Los Angeles Bureau of Engineering is the
13 first entity which reviewed the proposed Project.

14 14. Defendant and Respondent the City of Los Angeles Board of Public Works was
15  the entity to whom Plaintiff Carter appealed this matter, by and through Families First Venice,
16 and those associated with that entity.

17 15. Collectively, these City entities and the City are referred to as the City.

18 16. Defendant and Respondent California Coastal Commission (sometimes,
19 "Commission") is an agency of the State of California which is required by the California
20 Coastal Act to protect and preserve coastal resources. Plaintiffs appealed the City's
21 determination on the CDP which the City issued for the Project to the Commission, but the
22 Commission rejected the appeal on the supposed ground that the Project did not require a CDP
23 based upon the wording of California Health. & Safety Code section 50675.1.1(g). The
24 Commission's refusal to hear the appeal was an abuse of discretion and its reading of section
25 50675.1.1(g) fails as a matter of law, because by its terms, that subdivision only exempts housing
26 projects from review for conformity with "any applicable local plan, standard, or requirement,"
27  whereas the Coastal Act (and local agency actions to implement it such as Los Angeles
28 Municipal Code section 12.20.2) represents a series of State mandates.
First Amended Petition & Complaint

1 17. Plaintiffs exhausted all administrative remedies by appealing this matter to the

2 Board of Public Works and then the California Coastal Commission. Plaintiffs either were not
3 required to appeal the City Council's determination that the Project was exempt from CEQA

4 because they were informed that the City Council had already passed upon the exemption, and

5 because the City Attorney informed them that no appeal was necessary, or Plaintiffs did appeal

6 this matter to the City Council through a request for an appeal to the City Attorney's office.

7 18. Respondent and Defendant City of Los Angeles itself is also a Real Party in

8 Interest, as is the entity to which the City deeded the Ramada Inn, PATH.

9 19. The Situation in Venice. _The Venice neighborhood in which President's Row is

10 situated already has a significant homeless crime problem. Just between late October of last year

11 and mid-March of this year, there have been at least three murders of senior citizens in Venice at

12 the hands of the local homeless population. Violent assaults are a near daily occurrence.
13 Additionally, fires related to homeless encampments in the Venice area have increased

14 exponentially in the last 18 months, including a structure fire on Ocean Front Walk on January

15 13, 2021, and a fire in the Ballona Wetlands in which five acres of saltwater marsh and riparian
16 habitat for the endangered Belding's Savannah Sparrow and the El Segundo Blue Butterfly were

17 lost. The local, national, and international media now consistently report on the violent and
18 dangerous conditions the City has allowed to occur in Venice.

19 20. The homeless encampments include makeshift structures and piles of garbage on
20 the sidewalks that are crippling local businesses. Trash and human waste are pushed into

21 sidewalks, streets, and gutters, but the City has failed to study or assess the adverse
22 environmental impacts. Even the the U.S. EPA has noted that the City has failed to act with

23 proper urgency to address these serious environmental issues.

24 21. The massive buildup of shanties, garbage, and property of homeless individuals in
25 encampments around other City shelters have made the sidewalks impassable, and the City has
26 done nothing, despite its legal obligation to keep sidewalks clear for public use. The

27 encampment areas are now SO dangerous that local residents will not allow their children to play
28 outside.
First Amended Petition & Complaint

- 22. The City is well aware of the public nuisances and dangerous conditions affiliated
2 with shelter projects in Venice, but it refuses to abate those nuisances or protect public safety.

3

4 With its proposed Project, the City intends to recreate those unhealthy and dangerous conditions
in another residential neighborhood.

5 23.

6 As Plaintiffs and others noted in their comments, the proposed Project follows on
a failed larger facility known as "A Bridge Home Pacific Sunset"' licensed by the exact same
7 operator, PATH. In fact, there were approximately 114 calls to 911 from the Sunset Bridge

8

9 Home in just the first six months of operation of that facility. Nearby in Culver City, another
facility in a former Rodeway Inn motel was cancelled and its residents were returned to the street
10 after crime increased massively in the facility's surroundings.

11 24.

12 Despite the City's promises to the local community around the Sunset Bridge
Home to clear out encampments and keep the neighborhood clean and safe, the number of
13 encampents in the vicinity of that fäcility exploded, and the City has permitted crime and
14 violence in the area to persist without abatement. Moreover, the City and PATH permit residents
15 of the Sunset Bridge Home shelter to keep beds inside the facility, and maintain tents in the
16 encampment outside on the public sidewalks, beach, and other public right of ways.

17 25. This is not surprising, since the City requires that PATH may not require its
18 tenants to accept services, get sober, or be subject to criminal background checks for violent
19 offenses. Nor may PATH evict residents of the shelter for engaging in conduct detrimental to
20 the community at large or for criminal conduct offsite.

21 26. Venice is a very small community, only 3.1 square miles and a total of about
22 40,000 residents. In Council District 11, Venice accounts for 5% of the land, but 49% of the
23 homeless population.

24 27. Venice currently has 1,445 low income and supportive housing units, the highest
25  number by far, in Council District 11. Not including planned projects, Venice has nearly 3.5

26 units of affordable housing per 100 people. Adding Thatcher Yard (98 units), Reese-Davidson
27 Project (140 units), Rose Ave (34 units), Lincoln Apartments (40 units), and the Venice Bridge

28

First Amended Petition & Complaint & 6

1 Home-Sunset (154 beds) - Venice already has nearly 2000 low income and supportive housing

2 units.'

3 28. By concentrating its homeless services and shelters in Venice, the City has caused
4 the homeless population in Venice to explode over the last two years.

5 29. According to a January 2020 homeless count by the Los Angeles Homeless

6 Services Authority ("LAHSA"), there were 1,981 homeless individuals residing in Venice,
7 representing a 57% increase from 2019.2 The actual numbers of homeless living in Venice are

8 likely even much higher than captured in LAHSA's count, and those numbers have increased

9 drastically over the last 18 months, with no intervention by the City. According to this data,
10 approximately 1 in 40 individuals living in Venice are homeless. Outside of Skid Row, Venice

11 has the largest homeless population in Los Angeles.

12 30. While homelessness in Venice has increased by more than 60%, the homeless

13 population in the rest of Council District 11 has dropped significantly, including a 77% drop in
14 Brentwood, a 59% drop in Pacific Palisades and a 42% drop in Westchester/Playa Del Rey.3

15 31. Much like Skid Row in downtown, the City of Los Angeles is using Venice as a
16 containment zone for the homeless problem on the west side of the City.

17 32. Venice has more current and planned homeless housing projects than all of the

18 communities in Council District 11, combined. Despite this over-concentration of services and

19 homeless housing in Venice, the homeless population and related public safety issues have

20 skyrocketed.

21 33. The proposed Ramada Inn homeless shelter project is approximately only 1,000

22 feet in one direction from yet another shelter development, the 40-unit Lincoln Apartments/SPY

23 project, and another approximately 1,000 feet in another direction from the proposed Thatcher

24 Yard, a 98-unit development. And, the Marian Place Prop-2 Housing project is also just is steps

First Amended Petition & Complaint 7

P away. Concentration of these projects places an undue burden on the President's Row and

2 Oxford Triangle neighborhoods in terms of impact on public safety, quality of life, and

3 diminished home values.

4 34. The City's de facto policy to to use the Venice community as a containment zone
5 has resulted in a dramatic decline in the livability and safety of the neighborhood. The deplorable

6 conditions tolerated by the City in Venice are not permitted in other neighborhoods in the City.

7 This is a matter of fundamental fairness; • what is a City-wide problem should not weigh

8 disproportionately on a low-income working-class 'neighborhood. The City should be prohibited

9 from abandoning a single neighborhood, in an apparent effort to spare other neighborhoods the
10 burdens that confront the City at-large.

11 35. Venice, always a community of tolerance and compassion, is now blighted; its
12 sidewalks are unsanitary, unsafe, and often impassable. Open-air drug sales and other criminal
13 activity, plus crowds of drug users and sidewalk-blocking tents, pervade and threaten the health
14 and lives of all of Venice's residents. The conditions now prevailing in Venice constitute a
15 violation of the fundamental civil rights of those residing and working there.

16 36. The City's containment policy has exacerbated the dangers and harms to those

17 who live, work, and go to school in Venice, and it threatens to do so for years to come. The
18 City's proposed Project is yet another example of such containment policy and unmitigated
19 dangers being foisted upon the Venice community.

20 37. Defendants have arbitrarily determined where homeless encampments, shelters,

21 and services may or may not be located and what communities should be affected, without
22 following their own respective procedures and in violation of both state and federal law. This

23 has placed a disproportionate burden on persons, communities, and businesses in Venice over

24 others.

25 38. Violations of CEQA. The California Legislature enacted CEQA with two
26 primary goals in mind: environmental protection and public participation:

27 If CEQA is scrupulously followed, the public will know the basis on which its
28 responsible officials either approve or reject environmentally significant action, and the public, being duly informed, can respond accordingly to action with
First Amended Petition & Complaint 8

.

1 which it disagrees. The [CEQA] process protects not only the environment but
2 informed self-government.

3 Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (1988) 47 Cal. 3d 376, 392
4 ("Laurel Heights P').

5 39. Plaintiffs allege and alleged before the City - that there are innumberable
6 potential impacts to the environment that the Project may have.

7 40. Despite these impacts, the City filed a Notice of Exemption under CEQA with
8 respect to this Project.

9 41. Defendants' Notice of Exemption is fundamentally incorrect because it relies on

10 two sources which provide no support for this Project.

11 The Notice of Exemption relies on state CEQA Guidelines section 15269(c), which is an

12 exemption for "emergency" projects. The present Project does not constitute an

13 emergency under the Guideline.

14 The Notice of Exemption relies on Public Resources Code section 21080(b)(4), which

15 also states that it is for "[s]pecific actions necessary to prevent or mitigate an

16 emergency." The present Project is not an emergency under the statute.

17 The Notice of Exemption relies on Health & Safety Code section 50675.1.2. However, to

18 qualify for the exemption from CEQA there stated, the Project would have to be "funded

19 pursuant to Section 50675.1.1." The present Project is not so funded, as the funds used

20 for this purchase did not come come from the State. The State has no record identifying

21 this project as one of its approved sites, and the City Administrative Officer has

22 confirmed that the City did not apply to the State or use State funds for this purchase, as

23 required by section 50675.1.1.

24 42. The City therefore completely failed in its duty to conduct any CEQA review
25  whatsoever for the Project.

26 43. Plaintiffs have exhausted their administrative remedies under CEQA by appealing

27 the Bureau of Engincering's decisions to the Board of Public Works and then, to the extent it was

28

First Amended Petition & Complaint 9

necessary, to the City Council through the City Attorney's Office. The City Council failed to

2 act.

3 44. Plaintiffs are providing notice of this First Amended Complaint to the Attorney

4 General herewith.

5 45. Lack of Compliance with the Coastal Act or the Los Angeles Municipal Code.

6 The City has also failed to comply with the requirements of the Coastal Act and its own

7 Municipal Code implementing the Coastal Act. Plaintiffs exhausted all administrative remedies

8 before the City by appealing this matter to the Board of Public Works, and they timely appealed

9 this matter to the California Coastal Commission. The Coastal Commission abused its discretion

10 with a pure error of law in electing not to hear Plaintiffs' appeal.

11 46. Failure to Conform to the Los Angeles City Charter. The City's approval of the

12 Project also violated the Los Angeles City Charter, which clearly provides for an "Early Warning
13 System" by which the Venice Neighborhood Council should have received notice of the
14 proposed Project before the City Council acted upon it in December 2020. Further, the City
15 Council's approval of the Project violated Los Angeles Administrative Code section
16 22.810.1(f)(2) for the same reason, as well as the Department of Neighborhood Empowerment's

17 Plan for a Citywide System of Neighborhood Councils, Articles VII and VIII. The Charter,

18 which was enacted by the City's electorate, forms the City's "Constitution," and any ordinances

19 which conflict with the Charter's mandatory provision for an Early Warning System are void.

20 47. Disregard for Procedural Due Process. The City's approval of the Project
21 further violated the provisions in the State and federal Constitutions for due process including
22 procedural due process because the City repeatedly neglected to inform the residents in the
23 affected community about the Project or the City's process on the Project, because the two
24 "hearing officers" for the initial and "re-do" hearings before the Bureau of Engineering were
25 project proponents on behalf of Real Parties City and PATH, because the Bureau of Engineering
26 officer who signed the agency's Final Staff Report then prosecuted the CDP application before

27 the Board of Public Works and was advised by the Bureau of Engineering's prosecuting
28 employee in that process, because the prosecuting Bureau of Engineering employee apparently
First Amended Petition & Complaint 10

1 drafted the Board of Public Works' decision, because the City failed to inform the Plaintiffs, who

2 were the appellants of the hearing on their own appeal before the Board of Public Works, and

3 because the City Council had already passed upon the Project, meaning that the results of all
4 subsequent hearings were predetermined.

5 48. Failure to Comply with California Constitution Article XXXIV. The City's and

6 Coastal Commision's actions to approve the Project additionally run afoul of California
7 Constitution, Article XXXIV, section 1, which provides that:

8 No low rent housing project shall hereafter be developed, constructed, or acquired

9 in any manner by any state public body until, a majority of qualified electors of the city, town or county, as the case may be . . . approve such project by voting in
10 favor thereof at an election to be held for that purpose.

11 Cal. Const., art. XXXIV, § 1. The section defines the term "state public body" to mean "this
12 State, or any city, city and county, county, district, authority, agency, or any other subdivision or

13 public body of this State." Id. The City did not take the Ramada Project to the voters for

14 approval. The electors' approval of general obligation bonds in Measure HHH did not constitute
15 the approval of the Ramada "housing project."

16 49. Gift of Public Funds. Finally, the City's payment for the Ramada Inn site, and

17 subsequent agreements with PATH, some of which should be but are not matter of public
18 record, constitute an illegal gift of public funds.

19 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
20 FAILURE TO CONDUCT CEQA REVIEW
(Against All Defendants)
21 50. Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through 49 above.
22 51. Unless a project is statutorily or categorically exempt, a public entity such as the
23 City of Los Angeles and its subsidiary entities must determine if there is any substantial evidence
24 that a project may have a significant impact on the environment, and if there is, it must prepare
25 an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"). As alleged previously herein, the Project was not
26 statutorily or categorically exempt, and the City failed to prepare an EIR.
27

28

First Amended Petition & Complaint 11

1 52. Even if there is no substantial evidence of a significant impact, a public entity
2 such as the City of Los Angeles and its subsidiary entities must prepare a negative declaration or

3 a mitigated negative declaration. The City failed to prepare a negative declaration in this case.
4 53. The City must be ordered to comply with CEQA and to invite the public
5 participation, pursuant to CEQA, which it failed to invite thus far.

6 54. Plaintiffs exhausted all available administrative remedies. Their suit is timely

7 because the initial Petition and Complaint in this action was filed within 35 days of the City's
8 filing of a Notice of Exemption with the State's Office of Planning & Research, which filing was

9 one of those required for the Notice of Exemption to be valid under Governor Newsom's
10 Executive Orders N-80-20 and N-54-20.

11 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

12 VIOLATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL ACT & LOS ANGELES MUNICIPAL CODE SECTION 12.20.2

13 (Against All Defendants)
55.
14 Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through 54 above.

56.
15 The City's proposed Project and the City's actions to approve the Project violated

16 multiple substantive provisions of the Coastal Act, including, without limitation, California
Public Resources Code §§ 30001; 30001.5; 30003; 30004; 30005; 30006; 30007.5; 30010;
17

18 30105.5; 30116; 30210; 30211; 30213; 30214; 30222; 30223; 30231; 30253; and 30604. The

19 City's Project also violates multiple provisions of Los Angeles Municipal Code section 12.20.2,

20 enacted by the City under the requirements of the Coastal Act.
57.
21 The Project constitutes "Development" pursuant to Los Angeles Municipal Code
section 12.20.2 B and Coastal Act section 30106 because it represents a "change in the density or
22
intensity of the use of land."
23
58.
24 The City's proposed Project eliminates an affordable visitor-serving hotel and

25 discriminates against diverse and lower-income tourists in violation of the Coastal Act's and

26 Municipal Code's mandates that such should be preserved and protected.

59.
27 The proposed Project also decreases access.to and along the coast, fails to protect

28 the marine environment, and fails to restore the overall quality of the coastal zone. Spillover

First Amended Petition & Complaint 12' •

1 encampments from the City's and PATH's other locations in Venice have led to significant

2 crime and violence, which deter tourism and public recreation, and lead to trash, urine, feces,
3 drug needles, and other contaminants and biohazards running into the storm drains directly to the

4 Pacific Ocean. No studies have been conducted concerning these impacts or what can be done to
5 mitigate them, and no academic or scientific experts have been consulted as required by the

6 Coastal Act.

7 60. There also will be additional noise, pollution, garbage, and water use from the

8 laundry, food service, and kitchenettes due to full-time maximum occupancy. Nothing in the

9 CDP addresses these concerns, which unquestionably constitute a change to the density and
10 intensity of the use of land. The City failed to address or consider these significant changes

11 when it approved the CDP.

12 61. Municipal Code section 12.20.2 A(c) states that its goals are "to promote the
13 public safety, health, and welfare" and "to protect public and private property." However, the

14 CDP includes inadequate conditions to address the safety, security, cleanliness, encampment and

15 crime abatement, or other safety, health, welfare or property concerns of the surrounding
16 neighborhood. The Regulatory Agréement on file with the' deed to the land specifically states

17 that PATH must ensure that tenants will not face a loss of housing, ineligibility, or termination
18 from the program due to their inability to stop engaging in risky or harmful behaviors. Without

19 any remedy to deal with shelter residents who create a public nuisance or commit crimes in the
20 local neighborhood, the City has failed to comply with section 12.20.2 A(c).
21 62. The City and the Coastal Commission failed to protect a special coastal
22 community in allowing the Project to proceed, because Venice has been designated as a special

23 coastal community. The City and Commission failed to consider the cumulative adverse impacts
24 of this proposed development, when considered with past, current, and future similar projects, on
25 tourism, beach access, public recreation, public safety, the marine environment, and the special
26 coastal neighborhood in which the Project is located, in violation of the Coastal Act.

27 63. The Coastal Act mandates that the public has a right to fully participate in

28 decisions affecting coastal planning, conservation, and development, and that such planning
First Amended Petition & Complaint 13

should include the widest opportunity for public participation. Here, contrary to the Coastal Act
and other laws, the City engaged in repeated due process violations including providing

3 inadequate notice within the community, violating the Municipal Code, violating the City
4 Charter, conducting biased hearings, and failing to notify the Plaintiffs and other members of the
5  public - who were the appellants - about the Board of Public Works' appeal hearing on April

6 14, 2021.

7 64. Among other things, the City failed to mail notice of the hearing to the list of
8 property owners within 100 feet of the boundary of the site of the development as well as

9 occupants of all residences within 100 feet of the site's boundaries at least ten days in advance of

10 either the first, January 29, 2021, hearing, or within 150 feet for the second, February 11, 2021,
11 hearing as required by Los Angeles Municipal Code sections 12.20.2 E and F. In particular,
12 there was apparently no mailed notice to actual residents as opposed to property owners. And no

13 effort was made to give notice to "all persons known, or thought to have particular interest in
14 the application," which would have extended well beyond the 100-foot radius the City utilized,

15 "and all other persons requesting notice." All of the neighborhood residents who requested to be

16 on the "Interested Parties List" from the first hearing were left off the "Interested Parties List"

17 for the second hearing. In other words, they requested notice and did not get it.

18 65. Additionally, the City failed to post "At a conspicuous place, easily read by the
19 public and as close as possible to the site of the proposed development" notices of either the first
20 hearing or the second hearing on February 11, 2021. Los Angeles Municipal Code § 12.20.2 E
21  ("Notice - Posting"). The notice for the first hearing was obstructed by a construction fence

22 PATH erected around the property. And with respect to the second hearing, the City left up four
23 notices of the January 29, 2021 hearing which had already passed, creating substantial
24 confusion for members of the public who might have wanted to participate, and then it posted
25 one notice behind and above the construction fence on the less-trafficked Harrison Avenue side

26 of the site, on a sign a located approximately 7.5 feet above ground level, roughly three days
27 before the second hearing. This notice was illegible to passersby.

28

First Amended Petition & Complaint 14

1 66. The City's notices were further inadequate substantively, because they did not
2 include the following items required under section 12.20.2:

3 A statement that the development was in the Coastal Zone,

4 The date of filing of the application and the name of the Applicant

5 A description of the general procedure for the public hearing and the City's

6 actions

7 A description of the process for City and Coastal Commission appeals

8 A statement that an interested person must request to be on the mailing list for the

9 development in order to receive notice of the written determination and in order to

10 appeal to the City.

11 67. The City's application for the CDP violated Municipal Code section 12.20.2 D.1,
12 which provides that the application shall include a project description including "any feasible
13 alternatives or feasible mitigation measures. which would substantially lessen any significant
14 adverse impact which the development may have on the environment," because the application

15 did not contain any such alternatives or measures.

16 68. The City's process on the CDP did not provide the community with fair, objective

17 and impartial hearings as required by section 12.20.2 G and H for reasons stated hereinafter in
18 more detail, i.e., the individual representing the City with respect to the application before the

19 Bureau of Engineering was also the hearing officer, with the only other hearing officer being the
20 Executive Director of PATH, an interested applicant, and the same individual who signed the

21 Final Staff Report represented the Bureau of Engineering before the Board of Public Works.
22 Further, the Bureau of Engineering never provided Notice of its Decision, but only a non-

23 appealable Final Staff Report. Finally, the Board of Public Works and Bureau of Engineering
24 refused to provide the hearing procedures for the appeal to the Board of Public Works in advance
25  of the Board of Public Works' hearing on April 14, and the Board specifically rejected a request
26 for a continuance of that hearing.

27

28

First Amended Petition & Complaint 15

F 69. The City's January 29, 2021 hearing violated Municipal Code section 12.20.2 F
2 because that section requires that interested persons be afforded a "reasonable opportunity to
3 testify and present evidence," but:

4 The City refused to make the CDP application available until January 26, less

5 than three days before the meeting, and

6 The City (actually, private entity PATH's Executive Director) limited public

7 comments to two minutes.

8 70. The City's proposed development will also violate the rights of private property

9 owners in violation of the Coastal Act and the California Constitution because such Project will
10| significantly diminish property values, which effectively constitutes a taking by the government,

11 The Project will also diminish the quiet enjoyment of residential properties in the surrounding

12 area.

13 71. The City's proposed Project also violates the Coastal Act because it involves long
14  term costs to the public. To the extent that Plaintiffs have been able to learn about this Project,
15 which research has been hindered by the-City's refusal to respond to Public Records Act

16 requests, it appears that taxpayers are obligated to fund continued maintenance, services, and

17 other costs associated with this Project for at least the next 55 years.

18 72. The City's proposed Project also vialates the public safety provisions of the
19 Coastal Act as the Coastal Development Permit ("CDP") the City issued provides inadequate
20 conditions to address legitimate concerns about crime, violence, and other public safety issues.

21 73. This Project is not exempt from the Coastal Act.

22 74. The Commission's refusal to consider a timely appeal based on Health & Safety
23 Code section 50675.1.1(g) is an abuse of discretion reviewable by this Court as a manifest error
24 of law in violation of Plaintiffs' rights and the rights of others similarly situated.

25 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
VIOLATIONS OF LOS ANGELES CITY CHARTER AND ADMINISTRATIVE CODE
26 (Against Defendants City of Los Angeles, Bureau of Engineering, and Board of Public Works) 27

28 75. Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs through 74 above.
First Amended Petition & Complaint 16

:

1 76. The Los Angeles City Charter, as readopted by the electorate in July of 2000,
2 provides that the City is to adopt "procedure for receiving input from neighborhood councils

3 prior to decisions by the City Council, City Council Committees and boards and commissions,"

4 SO as to create an "Early Warning System," such that there shall be "notice to neighborhood

5 councils as soon as practical, and a reasonable opportunity to provide input before decisions are

6 made." Los Angeles City Charter, section 907. These provisions are implemented by Los
7 Angeles Administrative Code section 22.810.1(f)(2) and the Department of Neighborhood
8 Empowerment's "Plan for a Citywide System of Neighborhood Councils." None of the City

9 Defendants here complied with these directives: Neither the City Council, nor the Bureau of
10 Engineering, nor the Board of Public Works provided the required prior notice to the Venice
11 Neighborhood Council of the proposed Project.

12 77. To the extent that the City's Administrative Code section 22.809(f) attempts to
13 eliminate these notice requirements by providing that actions may not be invalidated based upon

14 lack of notice to the relevant neighborhood council, that provision is ultra vires as it conflicts
15 with the clear requirement of the Charter. Accordingly, the City's approvals of the Project are

16 void for failure to comply with the City Charter in notifying the Venice Neighborhood Council

17 in advance.

18

19 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION VIOLATION OF DUE PROCESS (U.S. Const., amends. 5, 14; Cal Const., Art. 1, §7)
20 (Against the City, the Bureau of Engineering, and the Board of Public Works)
78.
21 Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through 77 above.

79.
22 Both the federal and California Constitutions require a minimum level of fairness
in an adjudicative public proceeding such as that which occurred on this Project. "Due
23
process
24 always requires a relatively level playing field, the so-called 'constitutional floor' of

25 "fair trial in a fair tribunal;' in other words, a fair hearing before a neutral or unbiased decision

26 maker." Nighlife Partners v. City of Beverly Hills (2003) 108 Cal. App. 4th 81, 90 ("Nightlife")

27 (emphasis in original), citing Bracy v. Gramley (1997) 520 U.S. 899, 904-905, Withrow v. Larkin

28 (1975) 421 U.S. 35, 46. This requires "an appearance of fairness and the absence of even a

First Amended Petition & Complaint 17

1 probability of outside influence in the adjudication." Nightlife, 108 Cal. App. 4th at 90
2 (emphasis in original).

3 80. In Nightlife, the hearing officer for the City of Beverly Hills chose an assistant
4 city attorney for the City to advise him as to whether the petitioners' adult entertainment permits

5 should be renewed. The assistant city attorney had also been an advocate for the City in

6 skirmishes with the petitioners on the renewal issue prior to the hearing. The Court of Appeal
7 wrote that "Thus, when, as here, "counsel [] performs as an advocate in a given case [he or she]

8 is generally precluded from advising a decision-making body in the same case,' Nightlife, 108

9 Cal. App. 4th at 92 (emphasis in original), citing 2 Am Jur. 2d Administrative Law, § 313,
10 "Separation of Prosecutorial and Adjudicatory Functions," and concluded that an "objectionable

11 overlapping of the role of advocate and decision maker occurred," 108 Cal. App. 4th at 94, such
12 that the petitioners should have been granted a new hearing. See also Dept. of Alcoholic
13 Beverage Control v. Alcoholic Beverage Control Appeals Bd. (2006) 40 Cal. 4th 1, 10-11, citing
14 inter alia Howitt v. Superior Court (1992) 3 Cal. App. 4th 1575, 1585, Nightlife, supra, 108 Cal.
15 App. 4th at 94, 997-98, English City of Long Beach (1950) 35 Cal. 2d 155, 158-159.

16 81. Here, the case is even more pronounced, because it was the employee
17 representing the City as applicant who actually presided over the Bureau of Engineers' hearing,
18 and drafted the Final Staff Report approving the Project's CDP. Well, actually the situation here

19 is worse yet: the other "hearing officer," who held the many public commenters to two minutes
20 each, was the Executive Director of PATH, the private applicant for the Project. There was
21 nothing impartial about this hearing, and all decisions that flowed from it must be reversed.

22 82. Plaintiffs were denied procedural due process in other respects as well:

23 The individual who purported to sign the Bureau of Engineering's Final Staff

24 Report actually represented the Bureau in the hearing before the Board of Public

25 Works, and she was apparently advised in preparing that argument by the

26 prosecuting employee/hearing officer from the Bureau of Engineering's hearing;

27 that prosecuting employee/hearing officer also apparently wrote the Board of

28 Public Works' decision.
First Amended Petition & Complaint 18

1 Plaintiffs were not given notice of the hearing date for their own appeal before the

2 Board of Public Works.

3 Plaintiffs were rot given advance notice of the procedure before the Board of

4 Public Works.

5 The outcome of all these hearings were predetermined, for the City Council had

6 already passed upon the Project and granted the funds for it before any of the

7 proceedings in the lower tribunals, such that the Project was a fait accompli.

FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
2 NONCOMPLIANCE WITH CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION, ARTICLE XXXIV (Against All Defendants)
3

4 83. Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through 82 above.

5 84. California Constitution Article XXXIV, section 1 provides that

6 No low rent housing project shall hereafter be developed, constructed, or acquired

7 in any manner by any state public body until, a majority of qualified electors of the city, town or county, as the case may be ..  approve such project by voting in

8 favor thereof at an election to be held for that purpose.

9 Cal. Const., art. XXXIV, § 1. The section defines the term "state public body" to mean "this
10 State, or any city, city and county, county, district, authority, agency, or any other subdivision or
11 public body of this State." Id. The City did not take the Ramada Project to the voters for
12 approval. The electors' approval of general obligation bonds in Measure HHH did not constitute
13 the approval of the Ramada "housing project." The City's electors have not voted on the
14 Ramada Project, and it must therefore be invalidated as unconstitutional.

15 GIFT OF PUBLIC FUNDS

16 (Against Defendants City of Los Angeles, Burcau of Engineering, and Board of Public Works)

17 85. Plaintiffs incorporate paragraphs 1 through 84 above.

18 86. California Constitution Article XVI, section 6 provides that "[t]he Legislature
19 shall have no power to give or .. to make any gift or authorize the making of any gift, of any
20  public money or thing of value to any individual, municipal or other corporation whatever." Cal.
21 Const., art. XIV, § 6, cl. 1. California Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP") section 526a permits
22 private individuals or entities to bring an action to "obtain a judgment, restraining and preventing
23 any illegal expenditure of, waste of, or injury to, the estate, funds, or other property of a local

24 agency." CCP section 526a applies against charter cities as well as all other local agencies.

25 87. Plaintiffs are residents of the City of Los Angeles and/or own property or
26 businesses therein and pay income tax, sales tax, property tax, business license taxes, and other
27 taxes, and therefore have standing to bring an action under Section 526a.

28

First Amended Petition & Complaint 20

1 88. The City used taxpayer money to fund the purchase the Ramada Inn, with no

2 public provisions for repayment by PATH, a private entity, in violation of the California

3 Constitution, the City's Charter, Article III, section 385, and CCP section 526a.

4 89. Further, the City spent in excess of $10 million on the property, and has obligated

5 taxpayers to spend many millions more over the next 55 years in a manner that constitutes waste

6 and misuse. The City's proposed Project is incapable of the ostensible goal of addressing the
7 homelessness crisis in any significant way.

8 90. Plaintiffs seek no damages hereunder and submit this claim for equitable and

9 injunctive relief only. Accordingly, Plaintiffs were not and are not required to comply with the
10 Tort Claims Act.

11

12 WHEREFORE, Plaintiffs pray for judgment against all Defendants for:

13 The Court's peremptory writ of mandate setting aside the CEQA Notice of
14 Exemption,

15 The Court's order that the City must comply with CEQA with respect to the Project, including preparing an initial study, and then an EIR if such an EIR is in
16 fact required,

17 An injunction or writ of mandate prohibiting all steps forward on the Project until CEQA has been complied with, and requiring the City and PATH to maintain the
18 status quo on the Project site,

19 The Court's order mandating a return on the writ once the City has complied with the Court's other orders,

20 For a judgment enforcing the duty imposed by CEQA to adopt a feasible
21 environmentally superior alternative to reduce impacts in any subsequent actions taken with respect to the Project,

22 Provisional relief, including without limitation, a stay on any construction or
23 development related to the City's proposed project unless and until such time that the violations set forth in this First Amended Complaint have been fully resolved,
24 An order requiring full compliance with the California Coastal Act with respect to
25 the Project prior to any further steps being taken therefor,

26 An order prohibiting and reversing the City's grant of funds for the Ramada site to PATH,
27 An order prohibiting the City from making further expenditures of public funds
28 on the Project,

First Amended Petition & Complaint 21

1

2 For costs of suit including attorney's fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and other provisions of law, and

3 Such other relief as the Court deems just.
