13. The procedures and findings for the Project are governed by Ordinance No.
2 178,063 ("Eldercare Facilities Ordinance"). The Eldercare Facilities Ordinance defined
3 Eldercare Facility and its various component uses (Senior Independent Housing, Assisted Living

6 14. The Eldercare Facilities Ordinance authorizes the Zoning Administrator to issue

an Eldercare Facility Unified Permit authorizing deviations from the use, area or height
8 provisions of the zone, or of any "Q" Condition only upon making required findings: (1) that the
9 strict application of the land use regulations on the subject property would result in practical
10 difficulties or unnecessary hardships inconsistent with the general purpose and intent of the

22 Procedural History
23 15. On March 31, 2020, an application was filed to develop the Project requesting an
24 Eldercare Facility Unified Permit and Site Plan Review pursuant to Case No. ZA-2020-2164-

16. On February 9, 2021, Associate Zoning Administrator ("AZA") Jonathan Hershey
2 issued a determination ("Letter of Determination") which conditionally approved the Eldercare

3 Unified Permit and Site Plan Review and found that the Project qualified for a Facility
from CEQA. 4

The Letter of Determination included findings addressing the six enumerated categorical exemption

6 findings for issuance of an Eldercare Facility Unified Permit for a Project requesting deviations 5 17.

from applicable zoning regulations. In its findings, the Letter of Determination accepted the
8 conclusions of a financial analysis submitted by the Project applicant and concluded that the 7

infeasible to build such a facility 9 deviations "are necessary for the proposed Eldercare Facility to enable a financially viable
10 eldercare facility; without such deviations it is impractical and

11 on the subject property." The Letter of Determination further included findings addressing ® +1Z06 d77 *dnoJo Mel jeuueuo 12 neighborhood compatibility, street capacity and General Plan consistency.

# euns "pAla EJIYSI!M £8€8 14 applicable zoning regulations in Condition 8(a) through 8(f): (a) a maximum of 80 guest rooms 13 18. The Letter of Determination approved the following deviations from the

16 5.06:1 in lieu of the otherwise permitted 3:1 FAR; (c) a maximum building height of 58 feet in
17 lieu of the otherwise maximum 45 feet; (d) a continuous width of the exterior walls fronting Holt

19 otherwise required 20-foot front yard; (f) 6-foot side yards in lieu of the otherwise required 8- 18

20 foot side yards; and (g) waiver of the long-term bicycle parking requirements otherwise required.

21 On February 22, 2021, seven neighbors of the Project, including two members of

22 Holt Partners, timely appealed the AZA's approval of the Project. The appeal challenged 19.

23 Conditions 8(a), 8(b), 8(c), 8(e) and 8(f) and contended the AZA's findings were clearly
24 erroneous and lacking substantial evidence. Among other contentions, the appeal argued that (1)
25 there was no legally sufficient hardship to justify the deviations; (2) the finding of compatibility
26 with the neighborhood was learly erroneous; and (3) the finding of no impact on adjacent streets

1 was clearly erroneous.

2 20. On April 27, 2021, the Central Area Planning Commission denied the appeal,
3 determined that the Project was exempt from CEQA, approved the Eldercare Facility Unified

4 Permit and approved Site Plan Review.

5 21. On June 2, 2021, Councilmember Paul Koretz introduced a motion in City

6 Council to, pursuant to City Charter Section 245, assert jurisdiction over the April 27, 2021
7 action of the Central Area Planning Commission on Case No. ZA-2020-2164-ELD-SPR-1A. The

8 motion stated:
9 Legitimate questions relative to the approval of the project have been expressed at
10 the public hearing, and specifically, concerns relative to the project's height,
11 massing, reduced setbacks, and shade/shadow impacts, which opponents have 8
UNS Channel Law Group, LLP L4Z06 12 noted are not in keeping with the envelope of this community, because at it is

15 22. On June 29, 2021, the City Council asserted jurisdiction over Case No. ZA-2020-
16 2164-ELD-SPR-1A and remanded the decision back to the Central Area Planning Commission.
17 23. On August 10, 2021, the Central Area Planning Commission denied the appeals,
18 determined that the Project was exempt from CEQA, approved the Eldercare Facility Unified
19 Permit and approved Site Plan Review.
20 24, On September 9, 2021, a member of Petitioner timely appealed the determination
21 that the Project was categorically exempt from CEQA pursuant to Public Resources Code
22 Section 21151(c). The City has not yet acted on the CEQA Appeal, and it remains pending.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
(VIOLATION OF LOCAL ZONING)
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 1094.5) 3

25. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
5 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

26. City abused its discretion in finding "that the strict application of the land use
regulations on the subject property would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships
inconsistent with the general purpose and intent of the zoning regulations." The Letter of
Determination reviewed each of the deviations and asserted that strict application of the

10 regulations would result in unnecessary hardship by rendering the project financially non-viable
11 based on a financial analysis submitted by The Concord Group dated August 14, 2020. However, 8 d77 Group, MET jouueuo 4LZ06 SIl!H L 0  VPIE SI A P R CE Beverly 12 Petitioners allege that financial viability - determined by commercially competitive profits - is
13 not the proper legal threshold for determining unnecessary hardship for speculative development.
14 Even if financial viability could be the basis for hardship, the purported hardships in this case -
15 height, yards and massing consistent with adjacent buildings - are not inconsistent with the
16 purposes of the zoning ordinance. Petitioners contend that some of the hardships, such as the
17 extent of common open space in the Project or high price paid for land, are self-created. Finally,
18 the findings looked outside the scope of the law and distorted the proper considerations of
19 determining unnecessary hardship by considering the Citywide need for senior housing.
20 27. City abused its discretion in finding "that the project's location, size, height,
21 operations and other significant features will be compatible with and will not adversely affect or
22 further degrade adjacent properties, the surrounding neighborhood, or the public health, welfare
23 and safety" and that "that the project provides for an arrangement of uses, buildings, structures,
24 open spaces and other improvements that are compatible with the scale and character of the
25 adjacent properties and surrounding neighborhood." The Letter of Determination inexplicably
26 concluded that the Project's components were compatible with its surroundings notwithstanding

extensive analysis of the Project's incompatibilities by Petitioners during the administrative

2 process. These incompatibilities include; the fact that the Project resembles an institutional
3 healthcare use that is inconsistent with adjacent small- to mid-scale multifamily residential
4 development; that the Project's combination of three adjacent lots to develop one structure
5 results in an out-of-scale development; that the Project's height of 58 feet is an incompatible
6 height compared to the generally two- and three-story development on adjacent properties; that
7 the Project's height and reduced yards result in shade/shadow impacts on adjacent parcels

8 including residential garden plots and yards; that the reduced front yard is inconsistent with
9 adjacent development; and that major deliveries and ambulance visits would interfere with the
10 residential character of the neighborhood.

11 28. City abused its discretion in finding "that the project shall not create an adverse 8 d77 Group, MET ¡PuueuO LIZ06 L S  A PNE IU SI AA B OB SIlH AueAea 12 impact on street access or circulation in the surrounding neighborhood." In fact, the
13 administrative record is replete with examples of residents documenting the precise
14 circumstances of the Project, the narrow width of Holt Avenue, the fact that blind driveways
15 result in vehicle collisions and other examples of how the Project's delivery and ambulance trips
16 would adversely impact street access and circulation.
