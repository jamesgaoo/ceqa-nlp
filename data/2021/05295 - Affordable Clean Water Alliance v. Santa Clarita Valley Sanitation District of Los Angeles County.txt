Pasader 14 2.

15 Contrary to SCVSD's February 25, 2019 Resolution statement through

16 which SCVSD claimed to have abandoned or rejected its multi-million dollar, rate payer-

17 funded "Recycled Water project," Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon

18 alleges, that the District is proceeding with the Recycled Water project, and is doing so in
violation of CEQA.

19 3.

20 Among other things, SCVSD, in violation of CEQA, continues to: (1) make

21 capital expenditure improvements for the Recycled Water project; (2) supply new recycled
water for various uses; (3) enter into new contracts or other obligations to provide recycled
22 | water; (4) receive contract revenues from the sale of recycled water; (5) provide or commit
23

24 to provide increased recycled water allocations for end users, including FivePoint/Newhall

25 Ranch; (6) conceal its actions for the ongoing Recycled Water project through the

26 deliberate use of obscure and incomplete descriptions of capital expenditures and other

27 projects, including with the Santa Clarita Valley Water Agency ("SCVWA") and others;

28 and (7) understate the scope of authorized and funded capital improvements at the
Valencia Water Reclamation Plant as part of its ongoing Recycled Water project.

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

- 4. This suit challenges SCVSD's attempts to violate and otherwise avoid
2 CEQA compliance as to its Recycled Water project, which project will have significant,
3  unstudied and unmitigated environmental impacts.

4 5. In 2014, the District adopted a Resolution committing to the provision of

5 Recycled Water to the Castaic Lake Water Agency (now the SCVWA).

6 6. Because of the 2014 Resolution, the District became eligible for Proposition

7 84 grants, including the 2014 Drought Grant and Round 2 Implementation Grants

8 disbursed for capital projects, to meet regional long-term water supplies and reduce
9 dependence on imported water.
10 7. On or about February 25, 2019, the District adopted another Resolution by
8 APC 11 which it claimed that it had "abandoned" or "rejected" the Recycled Water project.
tOSL-LOLL6 VO 'euepesed North Marengo Avenue, RA IOS SA 12 However, the February 2019 Resolution in fact re-affirmed the District's commitment to

13 the Recycled Water project, but illegally purported to shift its CEQA lead agency duty to a
14 different agency.

15 8. The District's actions and misleading statements have violated countless

16 assurances made to the public and this Court as to the District's provision of the Recycled

17 Water project, including the District's claim that the Recycled Water project could be
18 studied independently from the larger Chloride Facilities project, and that the District
19 would prepare an EIR for its Recycled Water project.
20 9. As part of and in furtherance of its Recycled Water project, the District for
21 years has improperly collected tens of millions of dollars from rate payers for the Recycled

22 Water project that the District now asserts it has abandoned or rejected. Yet the District
23 has kept, and not refunded, tens of millions of dollars for its ostensibly abandoned
24 Recycled Water project.

25 10. Petitioner alleges that if the District's so-called abandonment is found to
26 have legitimately occurred - after years of collecting tens of millions of dollars from rate

27 payers it - then SCVSD's actions would constitute an illegal, wasteful and fraudulent

28 collection and expenditure of public funds in violation of Code Civ. Proc. § 526a, in

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

F a addition to a violation of the common law prohibition against government expenditures

2 and actions that are fraudulent, collusive, ultra vires, or that involve failure by the
3 governmental body to perform a duty specifically enjoined.

4 11. Despite its February 25, 2019 Resolution purporting to have abandoned the
5 Recycled Water project, SCVSD has continued to collect, and further increase, these

6 rates/taxes since 2019 until the present time. Petitioner is informed and believes, and

7 based thereon alleges that it the District - had it in fact abandoned the Recycled Water

8 project which was promised to rate payers in return for rate increases - had to have
to stop collecting the rate increased and to refund 9 adopted a concurrent resolution in 2019

10 to ratepayers the rate increases. The District has failed to do so.
8 8 12. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the
POSI-LOLLS pE 'enueAY obueJE YUoN WHIA MYI NIBLSAE ATOS SKE 12 District continues actively to pursue its Recycled Water project including by producing and 11

13 providing recycled water; that it has no proper CEQA document to support its current and
Pasadena, 14 ongoing Recycled Water project; that it continues to sell and obtain contract revenues from
15 the sale of recycled water; and that it continues to approve funding to build infrastructure
16 to allow the increased production of recycled water, as contemplated since at least 2013
17 when its rate increases began for, and as part of, the Recycled Water project.
PARTIES 18

13. Petitioner Affordable Clean Water Alliance is a California unincorporated
20 association which, along with various of its members and supporters, seeks SCVSD's 19

21 compliance with its legal obligations, and supports greater creation, retention and use of

22 recycled water for the Santa Clarita Valley community's beneficial use, while also

23 requiring SCVSD to comply with all applicable laws, including environmental laws. It is a
24 coalition of environmental, property owner, residential and business interests in the Santa
25 Clarita Valley and surrounding areas concerned with water supply, quality and cost, as

26 well as with governmental transparency and accountability issues.
Petitioner and its members have substantial interest in ensuring that
28| SCVSD's decisions are in conformity with the requirements of law, and in having those 27 14.

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

requirements properly executed and the public duties of SCVSD enforced. Petitioner and

2 its members will be adversely affected by impacts resulting from SCVSD's actions and

3 approvals, and is aggrieved by the acts, decisions and omissions of SCVSD as alleged in

4 this petition. Petitioner is suing on its behalf, on behalf of its members, and on behalf of

5 all others who will be affected in the Santa Clarita Valley and Los Angeles County areas.
15. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that
7 Respondent Santa Clarita Valley Sanitation District of Los Angeles County is a special

8 district operating in Los Angeles County that is responsible for the collection and treatment
of wastewater within its jurisdiction and the discharge of treated wastewater, and is the
10  agency responsible for the decisions at issue herein.
APC on 100H4 g 'enuery oBUBJEW YYON GIZ 11 16. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names of the respondents sued herein as

1 MVT SILVERSTEIN POGL-LOLL6 VO 'euepesed 12 DOES 1-20, inclusive, and therefore sues said respondents by those fictitious names.

13 Petitioner will amend the petition to allege their true names and capacities when the same
14 have been ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that

15 # each of these fictitiously named respondents is in some manner responsible for the

16 wrongful conduct alleged in this petition. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based

17 thereon alleges, that these fictitiously named respondents were, at all times mentioned in

18 this petition, the agents, servants, and employees of their co-respondents and were acting

19 within their authority as such with the consent and permission of their co-respondents.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 20

21 17. Jurisdiction over Respondents, and each of them, exists because each of the
22 Respondents named in this litigation are present and operating within the jurisdictional
23 limits of the County of Los Angeles.

24 18. Venue is proper because most or all of the acts and omissions complained of
25 in this litigation took place within this judicial district.
GENERAL ALLEGATIONS 26

27 19. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of

28 Paragraphs through 18 inclusive, of this petition.

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 20. On October 28, 2013, the SCVSD Board of Directors approved a Chloride

2 Compliance Facilities Plan and certified its EIR ("Facilities Plan" and "2013 EIR,"
respectively). The Facilities Plan included two phases: (1) constructing and expanding
4 facilities at the Valencia Water Reclamation Plant ("WRP") to produce chloride-compliant 3

5 recycled water ("Chloride Compliance"); and (2) designating/providing part of that
6 recycled water to CLWA (now, SCVWA) for municipal reuse to meet the projected

7 increase of recycled water from the current 375-500 AF to 3,050 by 2020, and 9,600 by
8 2030, 15,600 by 2040 and 22,800.
21. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that in all
10 historic CEQA documentation since 2013, except for the 2017 Recirculated EIR, SCVSD 9

OdV 100[- 11 has not distinguished Recycled Water as an independent "project," but referred to it as a
GE 12 co-equal "objective" or component of the Facilities Plan, and used the description of MYT PO9L-LOLL6 13 "Support for Municipal Reuse of Recycled Water" to identify the Recycled Water phase. 8 North Marengo avenue, Pasaden NSASNENTS SK 14 | However, for purposes of this petition, and because the Court has conditionally allowed for
15 the District's representation regarding a separate Recycled Water project, Petitioner shall
16 refer to the District's recycled water plans and program at issue herein as the "Recycled

17

On or about July 7, 2014, the SCVSD Board voted to approve sewer rate Water project."

19 increases for a six-year period from fiscal year 2014-2015 through 2019-2020 in order to 18 22.

20 help fund the construction of facilities to produce chloride-compliant recycled water and

21 provide recycled water for municipal use, as contemplated under the Facilities Plan. The

22 rate increases in the 2018-2019 fiscal year would amount to about $83 more for the
and in the 2019-2020 fiscal year, would amount to about $100
more for the average family rate payer. The increased rates to non-residential properties, 23 average family rate payer,

24

25 e.g., office, commercial and retail, is typically substantially more.

26 23. Also on July 7, 2014, the SCVSD Board adopted a resolution committing
27 the District to assist CLWA (now SCVWA) and other agencies by production of recycled
a water as a local water supply. (*2014 RW Resolution.") The 2014 RW Resolution, along
- 6 - 28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

with multiple SCVSD officials' and staff comments at the public hearing extolling the

2 recycled water benefits of the Facilities Plan, were made in an effort to "sell" the rate

3 payers on increased rates to pay for the Facilities Plan and its promised recycled water

4 component (now Recycled Water project).

5 24. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that part of

6 the funds acquired with sewer rate increases was designated and used for purposes of
7 environmental studies to support the provision of the Recycled Water project for municipal

8 reuse.

9 25. On or about February 23, 2016, the Los Angeles County Superior Court, the

10 Hon. James C. Chalfant, ordered the setting aside and invalidation of both the 2013 EIR
APC 11 and the Facilities Plan approvals, and further ordered SCVSD to refrain from taking any
POSV-LOLL Floor ue 'enuany oBuaJeM YuoN WAA MY AS 12 steps to carry out the Facilities Plan until and unless SCVSD had fully complied with

ö 13 CEQA, all other applicable laws, and the accompanying writ. The judgment and writ that
Japesed 14 issued resulted in invalidation of the 2013 EIR.

15 26. In March 2016, SCVSD certified a Supplemental EIR (*2016 SEIR") to
16 address brine management (disposal of the by-product of chloride removal). ACWA
17 challenged SCVSD's 2016 SEIR, and the 2016 SEIR was also subsequently invalidated.

18 27. Both the 2013 EIR and 2016 SEIR describe the provision of Recycled Water

19 for municipal uses as one of the Facilities Plan's fundamental parts and objectives.

20 28. Blaming the Department of Fish and Wildlife ("DFW") and ACWA for

21 delays in SCVSD reapproving its Facilities Plan, SCVSD attempted to sever out recycled

22 water from the Facilities Plan.

23 29. On June 2, 2016, the Hon. James C. Chalfant, identified SCVSD's serious

24 problem of "piecemealing" in violation of CEQA, given SCVSD's then attempt to sever

25 out recycled water, and informed SCVSD that it must, inter alia: (1) provide "evidence"

26 that the chloride compliance and recycled water components of the Facilities Plan are "in

27 fact, separate", and provide "real evidence that" they "are severable"; (2) "give the public a

28
- 7-
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

chance to comment"; and (3) "rebalance the impact of taking the Recycled Water

2 component out as a project objective on its choice of project alternatives."

3 30. To address the Court's criticism, SCVSD announced that it would prepare a

4 Recirculated EIR ("2017 REIR") to analyze the "separation" issues and separability of the

5 Chloride Compliance and Recycled Water components of the Facilities Plan. Also, on

6 August 4, 2016, SCVSD issued a Notice of Preparation of a Supplemental Environmental
7 Impact Report for Study of Impacts to the Unarmored Threespine Stickleback [UTS] Fish

8 Under Reduced Discharge Conditions from the Santa Clarita Valley Sanitation District's

9 Water Reclamation Plants. ("2016 Recycled Water SEIR".)

10 31. On August 30, 2017, the SCVSD Board certified a Final 2017 REIR, which
ANESIS 201u af enuaNy oRuRiey (ION SAZ THE SILVERSTEIN LAW I 11 incorporated and readopted the previously-invalidated 2013 EIR and 2016 SEIR, both of
POGI-LOLL6 12 which reaffirmed and restated that the provision of recycled water was an integral part of

8 13 the Facilities Plan. At the time of certification of the 2017 EIR, SCVSD repeatedly
Pasadena, 14 assured the public, other public agencies such as DFW, and the decision makers that its
15 Recycled Water project's impacts were being reviewed under the separate but parallel
16 2016 Recycled Water SEIR. The 2017 REIR characterized the separation out of Recycled

17 Water as merely an "operational change."

18 32. The 2017 REIR incorporated by reference the first six sections from its 2013

19 EIR, which included Section 6 on all four Alternatives, without any change. The District's
20 2017 REIR indicated that the Recycled Water objective from the 2016 EIR objectives

21 remains valid and was only "deferred" and the environmental studies for the Recycled
22 Water were separate but parallel to the 2017 REIR.

23 33. On February 25, 2019, SCVSD adopted a resolution purportedly to cease its
24 Recycled Water project, withdrew the Notice of Preparation of the 2016 Recycled Water

25 SEIR, appeared to express a prediction that SCVWA will act as lead agency for purposes
26 of SCVSD's Recycled Water project, but yet simultaneously reaffirmed its 2014 RW
27 Resolution commitments to the Recycled Water project. (*2019 Resolution.")

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

- 34. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that SCVSD

2 has not rejected or abandoned, but rather continues to pursue, the Recycled Water project,

3 and that SCVSD continues to produce and sell recycled water and derives revenues
4 therefrom, as reflected, inter alia, by SCVSD's operating budgets for 2019-2020 and 2020-

5 2021, published in SCVSD's June 15, 2020 Meeting Agenda, i.e., after adoption of the

6 2019 Resolution.

7 35. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that

8 SCVSD's current chloride-compliance construction activities at the Valencia Water

9 Reclamation Plan ("WRP") and funded contracts are in furtherance of, and a continuation

10 of, SCVSD's Recycled Water project.

11 36. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that SCVSD
DOSL-LOLL6 JOOU HES JPRUROE WHH MVINIELSHSATIS 3HI North Marengo 12 with its Saugus RWP and Valencia RWP - is the only existing local source of recycled

8 13 water production and provision, and thus, is the only legally authorized lead agency for
Pasaden 14 required CEQA review for the Recycled Water project, which project SCVSD continues

4 15 to pursue.
16 37. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that while
17 two other future sources of recycled water are contemplated (Vista Canyon Water Factory
18 and Newhall Ranch Water Reclamation Plant), those sources are intended as part of their
19 underlying developments, will operate as a recycled water source only upon full buildout

20 of a significant number of units when the ultimate flow will materialize, will be limited in

21 capacity, and may not be able to meet their own recycled water needs in full.

22 38. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that on
23 August 9, 2018, SCVSD approved $17 million contract with Myers & Sons Construction,
24 LLC ("Myers"), which includes the addition of Ultraviolet (UV) Disinfection Facilities and
25 ancillary systems that would allow for further treatment of the influent wastewater. In
26 addition, Myers' work consists of a ground-up installation of several structures, including a
27 Flow Diversion Structure, UV Wetwell, UV Reactor Basin, and multiple junction

28

1 structures. Construction is anticipated to start in November of 2018 and take

2 approximately 24 months to complete.

3 39. The Contractor's description of the work scope specified: "The Valencia

4 Water Reclamation Plant reduces Los Angeles County's dependence on costly imported

5 water and helps to replenish a large percentage of the groundwater used by the region.

6 Due to the plant's important role in protecting public health and the environment through

7 innovative and cost effective water infrastructure, we are proud to have been chosen to
8 modify critical plant structures and systems."

9 40. SCVSD's description of the same item failed to mention the additional work
10 that Myers would perform, including the ground-up installation of flow diversion

11 structures and replenishing of water supplies, but merely focused on UV disinfection

20 of the UV equipment and the selected contractor will purchase the

21 equipment from the selected supplier at the cost previously agreed

22 upon." (Agenda, August 9, 2018.)
Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that SCVSD
24 has purposely omitted from its agenda descriptions the additional scope and purpose of 23 41.

25 work undertaken by Myers at the Valencia WRP, and others, in furtherance of the

26 Recycled Water project, in order to conceal SCVSD's ongoing Recycled Water project and

recyclables, and energy)." (Emph. added.)

8 43. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that on or
9 about January 31, 2019, SCVSD approved an $87.3 million contract with OHL USA, an

OdY Floor 10 Irvine Company, to engage in the expansion of the Valencia RWP, including but not

15 44. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the $87
16 million funding was for expansion of the Valencia WRP and creation of the Advanced

17 Wastewater Treatment Facility ("AWTF") to allow increased recycled water production at
18 the Valencia WRP as part of SCVSD's ongoing Recycled Water project.

5 recycled water from SCVSD's Recycled Water project, including as shown and
contemplated by SCVWA and others in various water plans.

48.

7 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that SCVWA

8 continues to rely on SCVSD's Recycled Water project, but without any required CEQA

9 documents in place. For example, SCVWA's April 1-30, 2020 expenses (in SCVWA's
July 7, 2020 Agenda) show an expense line for recycled water in the amount of

49.

13
SILVERSTE POSL-101L6 VO 'euepesed orth Mareng Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that

14 SCVWA's projected recycled water demand and supply relies on SCVSD's continuation

#% of its Recycled Water project, and is distinct from and exceeds any contribution from the
15 Buena Vista and Newhall Ranch recycled water amounts. Thus, even though SCVWA

16

17 currently receives up to 458 AF of recycled water from the SCVSD (as of 2019), its

18 projected water supplies from SCVSD are: 5,606 AF (by 2025), 8,077 AF (by 2030), and

19 10,054 AF (by years 2035 through 2050), further supporting that SCVSD's Recycled

57. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the

2 Newhall Ranch development includes the creation of the Newhall Ranch WRP to meet

3 only a part a of its recycled water needs and only at a later stage, whereas the remaining

4 larger part and from the beginning will be met by the SCVSD's Valencia WRP and the
ongoing Recycled Water project.

6 58. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that Newhall
7 Ranch and SCVSD renewed and reaffirmed their agreements for "Joint Sewerage Services
8| Agreement" in November-December of 2017, which restarted Newhall Ranch's various
9 projects, and that such agreements have not been revoked to date.

10 59. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that since

11 2018, Newhall Ranch - under the supervision of SCVWA - has actively pursued the
n APC WHId MYT NIESSHATIS 3HL $ 12 construction of pipes and recycled water tanks under the design-bid-build approach and in

8 North Marengo Avenue 13 reliance on the Recycled Water from SCVSD, without any environmental document in
'euepesed 14 place to support SCVSD's provision of recycled water to Newhall Ranch.

15 60. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that SCVWA
16 authorized and funded the constructions of infrastructure to support Newhall Ranch,

17 including the recycled water pipe and piping, independent of SCVWA's pre-existing plans,

18 without mandating environmental studies.

19 61. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that

20 SCVWA's continued funding to Newhall Ranch to create the infrastructure to

21 accommodate recycled water to be received from SCVSD and to support 22,000 units is
22 known to SCVSD and will be a catalyst for the actual development of 22,000 units.

23 62. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that between

24 SCVWA and SCVSD, SCVSD is the proper lead agency to approve the Recycled Water

25 planning activities of Newhall Ranch in the creation of infrastructure for recycled water to

26 support the 22,000-unit development.

27 63. The exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine does not apply in this

28 case as SCVSD continues to pursue and operate its Recycled Water project, and the 2019

3 Resolution, which was a ruse and artifice, did not change that fact. As such, there has been

4 no "abandonment" or "rejection" of the Recycled Water project. SCVSD is under an

5 ongoing obligation to comply with CEQA, and no exhaustion requirement exists or is

6 unsatisfied as to that. Moreover, SCVSD has repeatedly misled the public, and the

7 doctrine of equitable estoppel would apply to bar SCVSD from being able to defeat its

8 CEQA obligations through such artifices. Finally, to the extent exhaustion may apply, then

9 Petitioner alleges that it and others have exhausted all necessary issues.

General as required by law.

THE SILVERSTEIN LNCAIERNA POSL-LOLL 12 Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy available in the ordinary

17 (Violation of CEQA And CEQA Guidelines at to the Recycled Water Project.)

19 Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of
Paragraphs 1 through 65, inclusive, of this petition.

67.

20 i.e., the "project." Guidelines § 15151.

21 68. CEQA requires "good faith effort at full disclosure" of the planned activity,

22

23 CEQA requires public agencies: (1) to inform governmental decision

24 makers, other public agencies, and the public about the potential significant environmental
effects of proposed activities; (2) to identify ways that can avoid or significantly reduce
environmental damage; (3) to prevent significant avoidable damage to the environment by
25 requiring changes in projects through the use of alternatives or mitigation measures, and
26 (4) to disclose to the public the reasons why a governmental agency approved the project

27

28 in the manner it did. Guidelines § 15002(a)(1)-(4).

- 15 -
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 69. CEQA compels an interactive process of assessment of environmental

2 impacts and responsive project modification "which must be genuine." Petitioner alleges

3 that SCVSD's actions as described herein, including adoption of the 2019 Resolution by

4 which SCVSD falsely claimed to have abandoned the Recycled Water project, precluded

5 the interactive process of assessment of environmental impacts by the public, by public

6 agencies, as well as the enforcement of CEQA by the Court. Petitioner alleges that
7 SCVSD's 2019 Resolution was a contrivance meant to provide SCVSD with "cover" to

8 continue its Recycled Water project, while evading required CEQA review.
9 70. Petitioner alleges that SCVSD's ongoing Recycled Water project may have
10 significant, unmitigable impacts, including to biological resources, land use consistency,
APC g 11 air quality, GHG emissions, water supply, public services, traffic, noise, construction-
DNETACY NIELSHBATIS 3HL 91101-150 'enueny oBuaJeJ YION SIZ 12 related impacts, and cumulative impacts, which SCVSD itself has admitted through its
13 2016 Recycled Water SEIR NOP, but yet that SCVSD is currently violating CEQA by
Pasadena, 14 failing to prepare an EIR for its ongoing Recycled Water project.

15 71. As alleged more fully above, SCVSD, in violation of CEQA, continues to,
16 inter alia: (1) make capital expenditure improvements for the Recycled Water project;

17 (2) supply new recycled water for various uses; (3) enter into new contracts or other
18 obligations to provide recycled water; (4) receive contract revenues from the sale of
19 recycled water; (5) provide or commit to provide increased recycled water allocations for

20 end users, including FivePoint/Newhall Ranch; (6) conceal its actions for the ongoing

21 Recycled Water project through the deliberate use of obscure and incomplete descriptions

22 of capital expenditures and other projects, including with the Santa Clarita Valley Water

23 Agency ("SCVWA") and others; and (7) understate the scope of authorized and funded
24 capital improvements at the Valencia Water Reclamation Plant as part of its ongoing

25 Recycled Water project.

26 72. Petitioner further alleges that SCVSD deliberately omitted references to the

27 Recycled Water project in its approvals for new construction and expansion work for the

28 Recycled Water project, and also has sought to conceal payments therefore, including as
16 -
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

M reflected in SCVWA's check register payments for "Sanitation District No. 32," in order to

2 evade public disclosures and public scrutiny as to SCVSD's ongoing Recycled Water

3 project, and to subvert CEQA's mandates.

4 73. Petitioner ACWA as well as other members of the public will suffer
5  irreparable harm if the relief requested herein is not granted and the Recycled Water

6 project proceeds without proper CEQA review, including a full and adequate EIR, and

7 absent compliance with all other applicable provisions of CEQA and other laws.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 8

9 (Violation of CEQA And CEQA Guidelines For Attempted Illegal Designation of

10 Different Lead Agency and Improper Purported Shift of Lead Agency Duties.)
JoY 11 74. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of
POSL-LOLL 12 Paragraphs 1 through 73, inclusive, of this petition.

13 75. Although SCVSD's 2019 Resolution was of no force or effect in terms of 8 ,C 'anuary oBUeJeN (ION SIZ THE SILVERSTEIN LAW FIRM, Pasadena, 14 SCVSD's purported abandonment or rejection of the Recycled Water project, by said 2019
15 Resolution, SCVSD also illegally sought to shift lead agency duties under CEQA to the
16 SCVWA. Such action was void ab initio because there is only one correct lead agency for
17 SCVSD's Recycled Water project, i.e., SCVSD, because only SCVSD can produce and
18 make available recycled water. But further, the ostensible transfer of lead agency role and
19 responsibilities also would have had to comply with specific requirements under CEQA,
20 which cannot be shown by SCVSD.

21 76. CEQA imposes its mandates first and foremost on the "lead agency." "The
22 propriety of a lead agency designation is a question of law as it deals with statutory
23 interpretation." Planning and Conservation League y. Department of Water Resources
24 (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 892, 905-906.

25 77. Guidelines § 15051 provides criteria which govern the process of
26 designating the proper lead agency "[w]here two or more public agencies will be involved

27 with a project." Guidelines § 15051(a) provides: "If the project will be carried out by a
28 public agency, that agency shall be the lead agency even if the project would be located
• 17 -
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 within the jurisdiction of another public agency." Petitioner alleges that the production and
2 provision/sale of recycled water to SCVWA or FivePoint/Newhall Ranch (or Other entities)

3 will be carried out by SCVSD only, as SCVSD is the only agency which owns the
4 recycling water plants and will use its own facilities to produce the recycled water and

5 make it available for sale to others. The inquiry should stop there.

6 78. Guidelines § 15051(d) also provides: "Where the provisions of subdivision

7 (a), (b), and (c) leave two or more public agencies with a substantial claim to be the Lead

8 Agency, the public agencies may by agreement designate an agency as the Lead Agency.
9 An agreement may also provide for cooperative efforts by two or more agencies by

10 contract, joint exercise of powers, or similar devices." Petitioner alleges that Guidelines §
J00i APC WälS MVT IELSHHATIS 3HL 11 15051(a), (b), and (c) do not "leave" SCVSD and SCVWA each with a substantial claim to
Pasadena, I Nerta dAatanga SYE018, POSI-L01L6 12 be the lead agency. Petitioner further alleges that, at the time of the 2019 Resolution and at

13 all times relevant herein, SCVWA had not made any substantial claim to be the lead

14 agency, nor had SCVSD secured any agreement with SCVWA to ensure that SCVWA

15
% agreed to undertake lead agency duties for SCVSD's Recycled Water project.

16 79. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that there is

17 no evidence of SCVSD's offering of, or SCVWA's acceptance of, lead agency
18 responsibility, including but not limited to no transfer of SCVSD's facilities, plans or

19 contracts to SCVWA, and no transfer of SCVSD's tens of millions of dollars in revenues
20 from sewer rate increases to SCVWA.

21 80. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that because

22 SCVWA has not adopted or accepted lead agency responsibility for SCVSD's Recycled

23 Water project, nor could it legally do so under CEQA or the Guidelines, SCVSD remains

24 the lead agency and is responsible for the lack of CEQA review for its ongoing Recycled

25 Water project and activities.
26 81. As a result of SCVSD's violations of CEQA, Petitioner ACWA as well as

27 other members of the public, responsible and trustee agencies, and particularly DFW, will
28 suffer irreparable harm if the relief requested herein is not granted.

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of Code Civ. Proc. § 526a)

3 82. Petitioner incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 81 of this

4 pleading, as though fully set forth herein.

5 83. Despite the many facts to the contrary, should the Court determine that
6 SCVSD has in fact abandoned its Recycled Water project, then the District is liable under

7 Code Civ. Proc, § 526(a) for waste and misuse of public funds collected for years from the

8 rate payers for the Recycled Water project.
9 84. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that SCVSD
10 induced the public and decisionmakers to approve many millions of dollars in sewer rate
MVI NIELSHIATIS 3HL PABS 20% 11 increases by claiming that the rate increases would serve and deliver the crucial benefit of
POSL-LOLL 12 creating locally produced recycled water, thereby decreasing dependence on more

8 'enuany oBUJEIN YPJON SIZ 13 expensive imported water supplies. Following its 2014 RW Resolution and meeting, the
Pasadena, 14 District issued a press release quoting SCVSD Board Member Laurene Weste as follows:

15 "This project will give a us a source of very high quality recycled water that we can use to
16 create local water sustainability in the Santa Clarita Valley and help reduce our

17 dependence on expensive imported water."

18 85. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that
19 beginning in 2014 and continuing through the date of the filing of this petition, SCVSD has
20 illegally collected many millions of dollars for the Recycled Water project, its planning

21 and implementation, which the District now claims to have abandoned.

22 86. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that by
23 conducting itself in this manner, SCVSD has collected money under false pretenses that in
24 whole or in part had been promised and appropriated for use for the Recycled Water
25 project, which Recycled Water project the District now claims to have abandoned or
26 withdrawn.

27 87. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that
28 following its 2019 Resolution, by which SCVSD claims to the public and this Court to
19 -
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

have abandoned the Recycled Water project, SCVSD has not only not refunded rate payers

2 the moneys collected for the Recycled Water project, but has also initiated further rate

3 increases. SCVSD's actions as alleged herein constitute an actual and/or threatened illegal,

4 wasteful and/or fraudulent collection and/or expenditure of public funds by SCVSD, and as

5 a result, violates Code of Civil Procedure 526(a).

6 88. Petitioner alleges that SCVSD must be: (1) enjoined from taking any

7 further steps or making any further expenditures for the Recycled Water project and its

8 related activities, including in connection with Valencia WRP construction and/or

9 expansion to allow for increased production and banking of recycled water and application

10 for or appropriation of State Water Board grant funds, whether passed through by SCVWA

13 accounting of all monies spent for and in furtherance of the Recycled Water project to

14 date; (3) compelled to revoke the rate increases and to readjust them to reflect the allegedly

15 abandoned Recycled Water project; and (4) compelled to restore to the public fisc all 5
16  monies collected and spent in furtherance of the allegedly abandoned Recycled Water

17 project.
FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION 18

19 (Common Law Cause of Action Against Illegal Governmental Expenditures)

20 89. Petitioner incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 88 of this

21 pleading, as though fully set forth herein,
22 90. As alleged throughout this petition, in furtherance of its Recycled Water

23 project and planning, SCVSD has engaged in actions, has expended public funds, and has

24 committed to further expenditures of public funds in manners that are illegal, negligent,
25 collusive, ultra vires, and/or that involve failures by SCVSD to perform duties specifically

26 enjoined.

27 91. SCVSD's actions and expenditures as alleged herein must be halted, and the
28 funds illegally spent or encumbered must be returned to the public fisc.

officers, employees, agents, boards, commissions and other subdivisions from granting any

8 SCVSD's Recycled Water project unless and until SCVSD (and no other ostensible lead

associated with such approvals and payments be enjoined and/or invalidated, and that
