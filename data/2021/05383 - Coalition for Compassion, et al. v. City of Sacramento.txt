25 (hereinafter, "Petitioners" or "Coalition") allege as follows:

26 INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

27 1. For many years, the City of Sacramento ("Respondent") has been attempting to

28 to address a chronic concern regarding numerous individuals that are unhoused, find ways
{00054352;2 ) - 1 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 spending many millions of dollars every year and repeatedly proposing new ideas and plans.

2 2. Respondent's latest attempt to address the unhoused-the City of Sacramento

3 Master Siting Plan to Address Homelessness ("Project")-is a rushed, behind-the-scenes,

4 political deal that blatantly ignores serious short- and long-term, and potentially fatal harm to the

5 unhoused, and wholly disregards significant environmental impacts that will occur as a result of

6 the Project. The details of the Project were kept secret from the public until the absolute last

7 minute, then rushed through in an up-or-down vote during a non-regular City Council meeting.

8 3. A major component of the Project involves relocating many hundreds of unhoused

9 individuals and congregating them under the W/X freeway, where they will be exposed to

10 extremely loud noises and deadly emissions and particulates that can cause substantial impacts on
11 their health and well-being. Indeed, expert state and local agencies air agencies (such as the

12 California Air Resources Board and Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality District) strongly

13 advise against siting any residential uses in close proximity to freeways with 100,000 vehicles per

14 day, let alone directly underneath such a freeway. The W/X freeway in the area where the City is

15 planning to congregate hundreds of vulnerable, unhoused individuals has average daily traffic that

16 is more than double this critical safety threshold.

17 4. As alleged below, the City's procedural and substantive CEQA defects when

18 approving the Project are pervasive and fundamental, so much so that they make informed

19 decision-making and informed public participation--hallmarks of the CEQA process-

20 impossible. Given the City's violations of CEQA when it approved the Project on August 9,

21 2021, Petitioner requests that the Court issue a writ of mandate directing Respondent to rescind

22 and set aside the Project, and to complete environmental review of the Project as required by

23 CEQA.

24 5. Petitioner, the Coalition for Compassion, is an unincorporated association with the

25 primary purpose of promoting the welfare of all of the City of Sacramento's residents-both the

26 housed and the unhoused. The Coalition and its respective members have a direct and substantial
27 beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondent complies with laws regarding environmental

28 protection. The Coalition and its respective members are adversely affected by Respondent's
(00054352;2 ) - 2 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 failure to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") in approving the

2 Project. The Coalition has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because the

3 Coalition and its members' environmental interests are directly and adversely affected by

4 Respondent's approval of the Project. The Coalition has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in

5 the ordinary course of law in that the Coalition, and those whom the Coalition serves, will suffer

6 irreparable harm if the Project is implemented. In addition, the Coalition has standing to pursue
this action to vindicate the rights of the public under CEQA and to ensure that proper
environmental review under CEQA is completed.

9 6. Petitioner Michael Malinowski is an individual and resident of the City of

10 Sacramento. He has an interest in ensuring open, accountable, responsive government and in

11 protecting the region's environment. Malinowski is adversely affected by Respondent's failure to

12 comply with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") in approving the Project.

13 Malinowski has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because Malinowski's

14 environmental interests are directly and adversely affected by Respondent's approval of the

15 Project. Malinowski has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law in

16 that Malinowski will suffer irreparable harm if the Project is implemented. In addition,

17 Malinowski has standing to pursue this action to vindicate the rights of the public under CEQA

18 and to ensure that proper environmental review under CEQA is completed.

19 7. The Coalition is informed and believes that Respondent, the City of Sacramento, is

20 a charter city incorporated under the laws of the State of California. The City is the lead agency

21 under CEQA.

22 8. The true names and capacities of the Respondents, Defendants, and Real Parties in

23 Interest identified as DOES 1-200 are unknown to the Coalition, and the Coalition will amend

24 this Petition to insert the true names and capacities of those fictitiously-named parties when they

25 are ascertained.

26 9. The Coalition is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that at all times
27 relevant to this action, each of the Respondents, Defendants, and Real Parties in Interest,

28 including those fictitiously named, were agents or employees of each of the other Respondents,
{00054352;2 ) - 3 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Defendants, and Real Parties in Interest, and while acting within the course and scope of such

2 employment or agency, took part in either the acts or omissions alleged in this Petition.

3 10. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Public Resources Code
4 sections 21167, subdivision (a), 21168, and 21168.5, and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1060

5 et seq., 1085, and 1094.5.

6 11. Original venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections

7 392, 393, 394, 395, and 860. Notably, the Project is located partially or wholly in Sacramento

8 County.

9 12. The Coalition has performed or is excused from performing any and all conditions

10 precedent to filing the instant action and has exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the

11 extent required by law, including as required by Public Resources Code section 21177. Notably,

12 the Coalition objected to the Project, and the grounds for this action were presented to

13 Respondent orally or in writing by the Coalition, its members, and other interested persons before

14 Respondent approved the Project.

15 NOTICE OF PROCEEDING

16 13. The Coalition has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code

17 section 21167.5 in mailing notice of commencement of this action to Respondents, prior to

18 filing this Petition. A copy of this notice is attached as Exhibit "A" hereto and incorporated

19 herein by this reference.

20 14. The Coalition will comply with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

21 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by serving the Attorney General of the State of

22 California with notice of and a copy of this lawsuit. A copy of this mailing, without copy of this
23 pleading, is attached as Exhibit "B" hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.

24 PREPARATION OF THE RECORD

25 15. Pursuant to Public Resources Code, section 21167.6(b)(2), the Coalition elects to

26 prepare the record of proceedings in this action. Concurrently with this Petition, the Coalition is

27 filing a notice of its election to prepare the administrative record. A copy of that election is

28 attached as Exhibit C.
{00054352;2 } - 4 -

H TIMELINESS

2 16.

3 This lawsuit has been commenced within the time limits imposed for this action
under Public Resources Code section 21167, 21168, and/or 21168.5.

4 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

17.

6 CEQA is California's broadest environmental law. CEQA helps to guide public

7 agencies such as the City during issuance of permits and approval of projects. Courts have

8 interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest protection of the environment within the reasonable scope

9 of the statutes. CEQA applies to all discretionary projects proposed to be conducted or approved

10 a by a City, including private projects requiring discretionary government approval.

18.

11 CEQA broadly defines a project as an activity which may cause either a direct

12 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the

13 environment, and that involves the issuance to a person of a lease, permit license, certificate or

14 other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies. The statutory definition is augmented

15 by the State CEQA Guidelines, which define a project as the whole of an action, which has a

16 potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably

17 foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment. (See Tuolumne County Citizens for

18 Responsible Growth, Inc. V. City of Sonora (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1222.) This includes all

19 phases of a project that are reasonably foreseeable, and all related projects that are directly linked
to the project. (See State CEQA Guidelines, § 15378.)

20 19.

21 A strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an Environmental

22 Impact Report (EIR) is built into CEQA that is reflected in what is known as the "fair argument"
standard, under which an agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence in the

23

24 record supports a fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the environment.
(See No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75, 82.)

25 20.

26 The EIR is the primary means of achieving the Legislature's considered

27 declaration that it is the policy of this state to take all actions necessary to protect, rehabilitate,

28 and enhance the environmental quality of the state. The EIR is therefore the heart of CEQA. An
EIR is an environmental alarm bell whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible
{00054352;2 ) .5 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 officials to environmental changes before they have reached ecological points of no return.

2 (Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376,

3 392.)

4 21. Under CEQA and the State CEQA Guidelines, if a project is not exempt and may

5 a cause a significant effect on the environment, the agency must prepare an EIR. (Public Resources

6 Code, §§ 21100, 21151; 14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15064(a)(1), (f)(1).) A significant effect on the

7 environment is defined as a substantial or potentially substantial adverse change in the
§ environment. (Public Resources Code, § 21068; 14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15382.) A project "may"
have a significant effect on the environment if there is a "reasonable probability" that it will result

10 in a significant impact. (No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 83 n.16.) This

11 standard sets a "low threshold" for preparation of an EIR. (Pocket Protectors v. City of

12 Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 903, 928.)

13 22. Despite being notified of its inadequate CEQA review, the City, on August 9,

14 2021, as lead agency under CEQA for the Project, adopted a resolution whereby it approved the

15 Project. The City erroneously determined that the Project was exempt and/or not subject to

16 CEQA.

17 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Violation of the California Enviroumental Quality Act)

19 23. The Coalition re-alleges and incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs of

20 this Petition.

21 24. "[T]he legislature intended [CEQA] to be interpreted in such manner as to afford

22 the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory

23 language." (City of San Diego v. Board of Trustees of the California State University (2015) 61

24 Cal.4th 945, 963.) When complying with CEQA, a lead agency must proceed in the manner

25 required by law, and its factual determinations must be supported by substantial evidence.
26 25. The City claimed the Project is exempt from CEQA for various reasons. However,

27 the cited reasons are inapplicable and/or extraordinary circumstances except the Project from any

28 CEQA exemption. Thus, the Project is not exempt from CEQA.
{00054352;2 ) - 6 -

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 26. The City abused its discretion in numerous ways, such as by relying on a

2 procedurally and substantively flawed CEQA analysis, by improperly determining that the Project

3 is exempt from CEQA review, and by approving a project that has not yet undergone adequate

4 CEQA review.

5 27. As a result of the City's violation of CEQA, the Coalition has been harmed insofar

6 as the Coalition, its members, other members of the public, and the responsible decision-makers

7 were not fully informed about the potential adverse environmental impacts of the Project, and

8 insofar as the Coalition, its members, and other members of the public did not have an

9 opportunity to participate meaningfully in the analysis of such impacts before approval of the

10 Project.

11 28. The inadequacies alleged above are prejudicial and require the City's CEQA

12 actions and approval of the Project to be rescinded until full environmental review in compliance

13 with CEQA is conducted. The City's actions constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion because

14 they failed to proceed in the manner required by law and because their conclusions are not

15 supported by substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5.)

16 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

17 WHEREFORE, the Coalition prays for relief as follows:

18 1. For interlocutory and permanent injunctive relief restraining the City from taking

19 any action to carry out the Project;

20 2. For a peremptory writ of mandate commanding that the City (1) set aside and

21 vacate its approvals relating to the Project and the CEQA exemptions; and (2) refrain from

22 granting any further approvals or permits for the Project unless and until the City complies fully

23 with the requirements of CEQA;

24 3. For costs of suit;

25 4. For attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5; and

26 5. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

COALITION FOR COMPASSION

August 10, 2021

RE: August 10, 2021 City Council Agenda Item No. 1: City of Sacramento Master Siting Plan to Address Homelessness

Dear Sacramento City Council and Mayor,
This letter is sent on behalf of the Coalition of Compassion. Your plan to approve the City of Sacramento Master Siting Plan to Address Homelessness (Plan) is extremely flawed, dangerous to those experiencing homelessness, unfair to disadvantaged residents and businesses that will
have shelters placed across the street from them, disproportionately burdens neighborhoods that are already disadvantaged, and fails to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). Thus, the Plan must not be passed.
I. Siting individuals experiencing homelessness under freeways is dangerous to their health.
The Plan includes siting numerous individuals experiencing homelessness in close proximity to freeways (indeed, some sites are directly adjacent to freeways). This poses an extreme health risk to the individuals that the City plans to have stay there. This shows utter disregard for the health and wellbeing of these individuals that are already compromised in terms of healthcare and wellbeing

The Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD) and California Air
Resources Board (CARB) have repeatedly gone on record stating that new land uses, such as residential uses, for sensitive populations such as children, the elderly, and those with pre- existing chronic conditions such as heart disease and diabetes (such as is the case with many people experiencing homelessness), "not be sited within 500 feet of a roadway with 100,000 vehicles per day." Average daily traffic on State Highway 50 between 18th Street and 26th Street is 246,000 to 258,000 vehicles. That is, the traffic in the area where the Plan intends to house
approximately 800 individuals is more than double the number that CARB considers too high for residential uses.

As CARB has demonstrated, "vehicle traffic generates fine particulate matter, including metallic constituents, which is strongly associated with asthma, blood pressure increases, cognitive decline, stroke, and death from heart attack." (See attached Letter at p. 1.) How can the City in good conscience plan to send the poorest among us, individuals with compromised health, and in-need to such sites, knowing the risks associated with such a location. This is particularly true because the planned shelters will not include critical health and safety safeguards such as advanced air filtration systems to reduce exposure to particulate matter and toxic air contaminants. Nobody should be encouraged to live under freeway. Yet the largest concentrated site (800 individuals per the Plan) will be doing just that. How is this equitable?

(See http://www.dot.ca.gov/trafficops/census/docs/2015_aadt_volumes.pdf.

Why is it that the City thinks it is okay to force these individuals into a situation where there health will be further compromised?
City leaders should be ashamed for thinking that individuals experiencing homelessness can just be tucked under a freeway somewhere, "out of sight, out of mind," and forced to breathe in the fine particulate matter, including metallic constituents, and diesel exhaust. Again, no site should be placed adjacent to or under a high-trafficked freeway. Doing so goes against expert agency guidance and shows complete disregard for the health and welfare of the individuals experiencing homelessness.
II. Sites should not be placed in already-disadvantaged neighborhoods.
Although not surprising, considering the City's typical "NIMB Y" attitude that protects the wealthy and further burdens the disadvantaged neighborhoods, the Plan primarily proposes sites in areas that are already struggling and have been neglected by the City. A review of the Plan's Figure 1: Priority Sites - Location within Council Districts clearly shows the "have's and have nots" of Sacramento.

Does East Sacramento include any priority sites? Very clearly, no.
Does the Pocket neighborhood include any priority sites? Again, clearly, no.
These are not outliers. The pattern of siting shelters in disadvantaged (and often residential neighborhoods) is consistent.
In contrast, take for example the W/X corridor. Not really Land Park, not really Midtown, not really Central Business District. The W/X corridor is designated a disadvantaged corridor by local, state, and federal metrics. Indeed, almost the entire W/X corridor has been designated as an Opportunity Zone and also as a Promise Zonedesignations reserved specifically for neighborhoods that are disadvantaged economically and have large minority populations.
According to the bourgeois attitudes reflected in the Plan, this creates the perfect "no man's" land to site more than a thousand individuals. The corridor already has multiple existing sites: Front Street (120 people), W/6th Street (300 people), and 29th / X Street Navigation Center (200 people). The combined existing sites have an annual capacity of 620 people. To that, the Plan proposes adding 800 more! That would result in a total of 1,420 individuals experiencing homelessness along a single, already-disadvantaged corridor.
Aside from the dire health impacts of siting 1,420 individuals adjacent to a busy freeway---in complete disregard of expert agency recommendationsthe concept of further burdening an already-disadvantaged neighborhood with 1,420 individuals in great material need is disgraceful. No other section of the City is asked to take on such a burden. Indeed, the wealthiest neighborhoods are not a asked to take-on even a single individual experiencing homelessness. How does that make any sense? You speak of equity when you campaign and raise funds, but your words are obviously hollow. It should not be a surprise (you are politicians, after a all), but considering your rhetoric and the promises you all tend to make, we thought you might do better.

What are you going to do for the local businesses in these already-disadvantaged neighborhoods? What are you going to say to the family that is barely scraping-by to make ends meet, that now lives across the street from more than 1,000 people that are also desperately in need, many of whom struggle with mental stability and drug addiction? Are any of the council-members that vote for this Plan going to be living across the street from a site? Or is it only the peasants that must do so? Don't worry, you won't have to see these struggling neighborhoods become further burdened while you go home to your far-away enclaves.
Again, these sites should not be placed in already-disadvantaged neighborhoods, particularly disadvantaged residential neighborhoods.

III. The City has failed to comply with CEQA.
The agenda for the Plan states that the Plan is exempt from CEQA under CEQA Guidelines sections 15269(c) (actions necessary to mitigate an emergency) and 15061(b)(3) (common sense exemption), and Government Code 65660(b) (low barrier navigation centers). These exemptions are largely inapplicable. Further CEQA analysis is required.
First, CEQA Guidelines section 15269(c) is wholly inapplicable. The exemption applies only for actual emergencies. This is apparently the slowest-moving emergency of all time. Homelessness is not new. Indeed, this problem has been ongoing and growing for years. But there is not a sudden emergency being faced that warrants complete avoidance of CEQA analysis. This shows blatant disregard for CEQA's mandates that public agencies err on the site of environmental disclosure, analysis, and protection. "CEQA is comprehensive scheme designed to provide long-term protection to the environment. [Citation.] ... CEQA is to be interpreted to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language.' " (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 112.)
Under CEQA, "'Emergency' means a sudden, unexpected occurrence, involving a clear and imminent danger, demanding immediate action to prevent or mitigate loss of, or damage to, life, health, property, or essential public services. 'Emergency' includes such occurrences as fire, flood, earthquake, or other soil or geologic movements, as well as such occurrences as riot, accident, or sabotage." (Public Resources Code, § 21060.3.) This definition "limits an emergency to an 'occurrence,' not a condition, and the occurrence must involve a "clear and imminent danger, demanding immediate action.' (Western Municipal Water District of Riverside County v. Superior Court (1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1104, 1111.) Again, there is not a "sudden, unexpected occurrence" of homelessness at the City's doorstep.
The City has not provided any why the time to undertake environmental review would create an immediate risk to the public health, safety, or welfare. Or at least, a risk beyond that which has existed for many, many years. The City's use of an emergency exemption for a problem that is neither new, nor sudden, is simply an attempt to avoid getting public input, properly disclosing impacts, and skirting its responsibilities to the public. This is a violation of CEQA.
Second, CEQA Guidelines section 15061(b)(3) (common sense exemption) is also inapplicable. The exemption only applies "if it a can be seen with a certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the environment." (14 Cal. Code Regs., §

Page 3 of 6

15061(b)(3).) There is absolutely no "certainty" that there is "no possibility" that the Plan will avoid all significant effects on the environment. Further, the City has the burden of demonstrating that this exemption applies. (See Muzzy Ranch Co. v. Solano County Airport Land Use Comm'n (2007) 41 Cal.4th 372, 386.) The City has not met this burden.
Indeed, there are very real risks of significant environmental effects as a result of the Plan. For example, there is very real risk of significant noise effects from congregating numerous individuals in close quarters - often with no hard walls to lessen the noise impacts. Placing hundreds of individuals (who may be outside for the majority of their time on the site) across from existing residences, could have significant noise effects. The City cannot abdicate its responsibilities to analyze this impact.
There are also risks of significantly exacerbating air quality emissions Although many of the
individuals experiencing homelessness may not have vehicles, there is a large portion that live in their vehicles, many of which are older models and have high emissions. Campers parked in safe ground parking lots, running their motors for heat and electricity will be idling, spewing particulates into nearby neighborhoods, exacerbating air pollution (particularly in areas adjacent to existing freeways). This is a potentially significant environmental effect. Further, there will be significant effects on the health of the individuals being placed in these sites adjacent to freeways (as discussed above).
There are also risks that the Plan will cause an environmental effect via urban decay. Concentrating hundreds (sometimes more than 1,000) of individuals experiencing homelessness in a single commercial corridor, particularly corridors that are already disadvantaged will have dire effects on the commercial viability of the neighborhood. It places burdens on already- struggling businesses that may not be surmountable. Businesses will close, and are unlikely to be replaced by other businesses. Putting neighborhoods on a downward trajectory. More and more vacant storefronts will be present, creating urban blight and corresponding significant aesthetic impacts. Further, the aesthetic impacts of placing huge tent structures, old motor homes, and tiny homes in areas have not been analyzed. These could potentially cause significant aesthetic
effects.

Finally, Government Code section 65660(b) (low barrier navigation centers) does not cover all of the sites. Many of the sites proposed in the Plan are not low barrier navigation centers. Further, the exemption is only allowed in areas where there is a "use by right" as defined in Section 65583.2(i).
As explained in that section:

(i) For purposes of this section and Section 65583 , the phrase "use by right" shall mean that the local government's review of the owner-occupied or multifamily residential use may not require a conditional use permit, planned unit development permit, or other discretionary local government review or approval that would constitute a "project" for purposes of Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code Any subdivision of the sites shall be subject to all laws, including, but not limited to, the local government ordinance
implementing the Subdivision Map Act. A local ordinance may provide that "use by right" does not exempt the use from design review. However, that design review shall not constitute a

Page 4 of 6

"project" for purposes of Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code. Use by right for all rental multifamily residential housing shall be provided in accordance with subdivision (f) of Section 65589.5.
There is no indication that the sites referenced in the Plan comply with this definition of "use by right." Indeed, it appears that many of them do not qualify under this definition.
For all of these reasons, the Plan is not exempt from CEQA, and further CEQA analysis is required.

Sincerely,

The Coalition for Compassion

RE:

Dear

Thank you for providing the project routing form for the to the Sacramento
Metropolitan Air Quality Management District (SMAQMD) for review. The project is a request to

parking development standards. SMAQMD staff comments on the project follow.

The
California Air Resources Board recommends that new land uses, such as residential uses, for sensitive
populations such as children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing chronic conditions such as heart disease and diabetes, not be sited within 500 feet of a roadway with 100,000 vehicles per day. Average daily traffic on State Highway 50 at 15th/16th Street is 246,000 to 258,000 vehicles.1 Vehicle traffic
generates fine particulate matter, including metallic constituents, which is strongly associated with asthma, blood pressure increases, cognitive decline, stroke, and death from heart attack. To protect the future residents of the apartments from excessive exposure to particulate matter, SMAQMD recommends the following reduction measures be considered: Install enhanced indoor air filtration to reduce residents' exposure to particulate matter and toxic air contaminants.. The filtration for the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system (HVAC) should be certified by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air- Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) and equivalent to or greater than that provided by MERV 13 filters (as defined by ASHRAE standard 52.2). A licensed mechanical engineer, or an individual authorized by California Business and Professions Code Sections 6700-6799 to design
mechanical ventilation systems, should be consulted. Building permit documents should
incorporate all designs and details necessary for the construction of the enhanced ventilation
system. The ventilation systems installed should be properly maintained as specified by the manufacturer. A fixed notice should be placed on the filter compartment door of each ventilation unit advising that MERV 13 (or greater) filters shall be used per local law.

1 http://www.dot.ca.gov/trafficops/census/docs/2015_aadt volumes.pdf

Plant a vegetative barrier between the major roadway and the receptors. The vegetative barrier should consist of tree species with year-round foliage. Suggested tree species and planting practices are listed in the SMAQMD's SMAQMD's Landscaping Guidance for Improving Air Quality near Roadways.

Construction
All projects are subject to SMAQMD rules at the time of construction. Specific rules that may relate to construction activities are attached. A complete listing of current rules is available at
