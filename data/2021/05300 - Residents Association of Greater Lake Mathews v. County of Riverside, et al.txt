11 PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY

12 9. In 1988, the County approved the H.B. Ranches Specific Plan (or "SP299") and the

13 associated Environmental Impact Report ("EIR 255"). Pursuant to SP299, Planning Area 1 No. 1 was

14 designated for undetermined types of commercial uses.

15 10. In 2004, the County approved Amendment No. 1 to SP299. The amendment renamed the

16 plan, the Boulder Springs Specific Plan (or "SP299A1"). The Boulder Springs Specific Plan included

17 various changes to Planning Area No. 1, including reconfiguration of the area and relocation of

18 permissible access points. Also in 2004, in connection with the Boulder Springs Specific Plan, the

19 County approved an addendum to EIR 255.

20 11. Among other things, the Boulder Springs Specific Plan and related approvals included land
21  use planning standards, architectural design guidelines, landscape design guidelines, a reduction of the

22 overall number of dwelling units in the SP299A1 planning area, increase of the available open space,

23 and adoption of an ordinance concerning the planning area's development standards and zoning

24 requirements.

25 12. The approximately 9.79-acre Project Site is at the northeast corner of Cajalco Road and

26 Wood Road, south of Carpinus Drive in Planning Area No. 1 of the Boulder Springs Specific Plan in

27 the County of Riverside, California. Planning Area No. 1 is designated for community

28 commercial/commercial retail uses adjacent to existing residential development.

13. The Project Site consists of four assessor's parcels. It is currently vacant.

2 14. The Project Site is bordered to the east and north by residential developments consisting of

3 single-family homes. A tree farm is located west of the Project Site, across Wood Road; and additional

4 agricultural land is located to the south, across Cajalco Road.

5 15. The Project Site is zoned C-P-S, Scenic Highway Commercial. The Boulding Springs

6 Specific Plan includes development standards and zoning requirements applicable to the Project Site.

7 16. In 2017, Real Party in Interest Cajalco Square, LP submitted the application for the Project

8 and related approvals to the County.

9 17. The Project includes Tentative Parcel Map ("TPM") No. 37537, Conditional Use Permit

10 ("CUP") No. 3775, and an addendum to EIR 255 (*Addendum"). The Project proposes to develop six
11 commercial-related buildings on the currently vacant Project Site within Boulder Springs Specific Plan

12 Planning Area No. 1. TPM No. 37537 proposes to subdivide the 9.79-acre Project Site into four

13 parcels ranging in area from 0.98 acres to 3.62 acres.

14 18. The Project proposes to construct a total of 41,158 square-feet of commercial buildings,

15 including two unspecified retail buildings, a drive-thru restaurant, a gas station with a convenience

16 store, a a car wash, and a gas pump canopy. The Project also proposes to include 249 parking spaces. A

17 conditional use permit, CUP No. 3775, is proposed to permit a car wash and the sale of beer and wine

18 for off-site consumption in connection with the Project's proposed gas station and convenience store.

19 19. Throughout various stages of the County's review of the Project, Petitioner and its members

20 engaged County staff and the Project applicant to voice concerns with the Project's proposals.

21 20. Around early September 2017, several of Petitioner's members met with the Project

22 applicant to discuss the proposed development.

23 21. Through 2018 and 2019, Petitioner's members continued to engage County staff to provide

24 comments regarding the proposed Project and its potential impacts. Among other things, Petitioner

25 submitted a comment letter to the County Planning Department in March 2019 opposing the Project.

26 22. A 2018 traffic study indicated that the Project would have significant impacts to traffic and

27 required related mitigation measures that the Project fails to incorporate.

1 90. Among other things, County Code Section 17.200.040 and Chapter 17.192.040 require

14 equalized assessment roll within 300 feet of the real property that is the subject of the hearing."
