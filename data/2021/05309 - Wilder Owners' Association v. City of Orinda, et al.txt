HARPER PHONE (510) 420-8455 • ES6S-8S8 (OTS) xva 17 Respondents have approved a development project that violates the City of

18 Orinda's own general plan and municipal code in multiple ways, as well as the State Planning

19 and Zoning Law, Government Code §§ 65300 et seq. Respondents also improperly certified the

20 EIR for the Project, erroneously finding, without substantial evidence and in violation of CEQA,

21 that the Project would result in no significant impacts on the environment.

22 Approval of the Project was and is inconsistent with the Orinda General Plan,

facility located on privately-owned land, cannot be approved under the current zoning.

25 Respondents have abused their discretion and failed to act in a manner required by law.

26 Petitioner therefore requests that this Court issue a writ of mandamus under CCP §§ 1094.5

RNN 14. Venue for this action properly lies in Contra Costa County Superior Court,
because the proposed site of the Project is located in Contra Costa County, Many of the
significant environmental and other impacts from the Project that are the subject of this Petition
would occur in Contra Costa County, and the Project would affect the interests of Contra Costa
County residents, including Petitioner and its members. Consequently, venue is proper in this
PQ Court under section 394(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure.

15. Respondents have taken final agency actions with respect to certifying the EIR
and approving the Project. Respondents had a duty to comply with applicable state laws,
including but not limited to CEQA and the State Planning and Zoning Law, as well as the Orinda
10 Municipal Code, prior to issuing the discretionary approvals at issue in this lawsuit.
11
16. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resource Code section 12 21167.5 by serving a written notice of Petitioner's intention to commence this action on ARMSTRONG, LLP 13 Respondents on March 8, 2021. A true and correct copy of the written notice and proof of

The Project Site and Project

20. The Project site is nestled amongst rolling hills in Orinda, California. This
picturesque area is made up of roughly 1,500 acres, with 1,300 acres dedicated to open space

A. managed by the East Bay Regional Park District and the East Bay Municipal Utility District. The
Project site is bordered by Highway 24 to the north, and the portion of Highway 24 adjacent to

9 the Project site has been designated a Scenic Highway by the California Department of
Transportation. 10
21. 11 The Wilder development is the only development in the Project site area. Over

12 twenty years in the making, Wilder is the only development of its kind in Orinda designed to
JTI'DNOLISUNV 13 preserve the surrounding countryside and habitat for endangered species. Wilder was designed

14 to protect undeveloped ridgelines and hillsides and to preserve significant or unique scenic

15 vistas, with only 245 homes on approximately 200 acres. The Project site is otherwise
dominated by open space with old-growth trees preserved and replanted, and ponds created for 16
8 the red-legged frog. The Project site features public trails, some of which connect to the Robert HARPER ES6S-858 (0LS) XV: PHONE (510) 420-8455• 1634 Telegraph Ave., #3, Oakland, CA, 94612 17 Sibley Regional Volcanic Reserve, creeks, woods, hills and meadows.
18
22. Violating the integrity of this open area, the monolithic proposed Project is a two- 19
story, 32,084 square feet, 38-unit private luxury memory care facility with a paved parking area 20 and a vehicle turn-around. Almost all of the 1.1 acre site will be built out, and the Project 21
requires the approval of exceptions to exceed maximum building, fence, and retaining wall
22 heights. The Project is a high-density, blocky development that will stand in stark contrast to its
23 surroundings: a low-density semi-rural hillside in a scenic highway corridor.
24
23. The Project proposes to construct and operate this massive private luxury facility 25
a on a site restricted by the General Plan Land Use designation and by the Zoning Ordinance for 26
Public/Semi-Public uses.

HARPER • SSt8-OZt (OTS) INOHd ES6S-8S8 (OIS) XVH The Project, which is memory care facility, is prohibited by the Project site's
zoning designation. The Project site is zoned as PS-Public, Semi-Public and Utility. The

follows:

18 "specific purposes" of the PS zoning designation in the Orinda Municipal Code are described as

19

20 The specific purpose of the PS public, semi-public and utility district is
to preserve established patterns of uses such as the high-intensity

21 community center and the East Bay Municipal Utility District ("EBMUD") filter plant and the undeveloped lands of the EBMUD watershed and to

22 subject any changes in existing uses (with the exception of new emergency shelters) to a heightened level of scrutiny to assure consistency with the
General Plan. OMC 17.9.1.

23 38.

24

25 Respondents and Real Parties have wrongly characterized the Project as a

26 "congregate care facility," as defined in the OMC at 17.9.2, in an attempt to allow the Project on

27 PS-zoned land with only a use permit. However, a "congregate care facility" is defined in the
Municipal Code as follows:

28

Case No.
Petition for Writ of Mandate Wilder Owners' Association v. City of Orinda; et al.

"Congregate care residential" means facility which provides twenty-four (24) hour nonmedical care of persons in need of personal services, supervision or assistance essential for sustaining the activities of daily living or for the protection of the individual. The facility contains small individual dwelling units of usually only one (1) or two (2) rooms with a small kitchen allowing for independent living but also provides common dining, housekeeping, recreational and social facilities. Health and Safety Code Sections 1502(a)(1); 1597.43. Small kitchens that comply with state and local standards must be included in each individual dwelling unit for this
M o definition to apply. OMC 17.2.3. (Emphases added.)
The final sentence of OMC 17.2.3 -- making kitchens mandatory and requiring 39.

compliance with state and local standards -- was the result of a City Council resolution on
9 August 18, 2015, which specifically added this language in response to this Project Applicant's
10 request for the kitchen requirement to be removed. At that time, the City Council also

11 specifically rejected language proposed by City staff that would have allowed for kitchens to be

12 installed but "temporarily disabled" for safety purposes.

14 commonly thought of as an "assisted living" facility for senior citizens who are still fairly
15 independent, but may require some additional support with activities such as cleaning, laundry,

16 and social activities. Kitchens are commonly included in assisted living housing units. 8
NEVH 17 41. Under the OMC, the kitchens that are required for congregate care dwelling units
18 must in fact be functional kitchens allowing for "independent living" and include either "220 volt
19 electrical or natural or propane gas service." OMC 17.2.3. But it is undisputed that the future
20 Project residents here will be individuals with dementia or Alzheimer's Disease who are not

21 capable of "independent living,' and who cannot have access to kitchens for their own safety and

22 the safety of others. A congregate care facility is not a qualified setting for such individuals, as
these persons need a higher level of service and care. Having a "kitchen allowing for

care 23

24 independent living" is definitionally incompatible with required restrictions for a memory

25 facility.

26 42. There is no type of memory care facility that can be built on PS-zoned land. It is

27 prohibited under the current zoning. The Project cannot have kitchens because it is a memory

28

Case No. Wilder Owners' Association v. City of Orinda; et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate

HN M t00N 0 care facility, but according to Project site zoning, functional kitchens are required. Faced with
this impossibility, Respondents could have directed the Applicant to include an application to
change the General Plan and zoning designation of the Project site so that a memory care facility
could be built on the Project site. Instead, the City evaded its own laws to approve the Project on
the specious grounds that the Project is consistent with PS zoning because each unit will include
a "kitchen" that will be rendered inoperable and inaccessible to unit residents -- the same exact

scenario previously rejected by Respondents. Suggesting that the kitchen requirement has been
technically satisfied, Respondents declared that the Project was a congregate care facility, despite
9 the fact residents will be physically restricted from use of the kitchens (because they will be

10 locked off), and residents will not be able to live independently. OMC 17.2.3. This blatant

11 effort to circumvent legal requirements was arbitrary and capricious and should be rejected.

12 The untenability of Respondents' position is also highlighted by California state
ITI'ONOXISWHV ES65-858 (0Ts) xva • SSTS-OZT (OTS) ENO! 7T9b6 VO puepo 's#eAY qdexSOpI PE9T 13 regulations governing residential care facilities for the elderly, which forbid kitchens in memory 43.

14 care units. Title 22, Section 87705 of the California Code of Regulations is entitled "Care of

15 Persons with Dementia," and identifies requirements for facilities caring for individuals with
16 dementia. Subsection (d) provides that "safety modifications shall include, but not be limited to, dd
HAdHVH inaccessibility of ranges, heaters, wood stoves, inserts, and other heating devices to residents

18 with dementia." (emphasis added). But here, Respondents have approved a memory care

19 facility that is required by the municipal code to have full kitchens allowing for independent

20 living, alongside a requirement to make those kitchens inoperable. This is absurd, and

21 contravenes the intent of the Municipal Code, the General Plan, and state regulations.

22 Respondents have no legitimate excuse for failing to comply with these state and local
requirements. 23
There is no federal basis for flouting the above requirements either. The Federal 24

25 Fair Housing Amendments Act makes it unlawful "to discriminate in the sale or rental or 44.

otherwise make unavailable or deny housing" to a person on the basis of handicap, and 26

27 "handicap" under the FHAA includes mental impairment. 42 USC § 3601(f)(1), 42 USC §

Wilder Owners' Association v. City of Orinda; et al. Case No.
Petition for Writ of Mandate

HN0t10 0N .0 3602(h). But disallowing private development that plainly violates a city's General Plan,
Municipal Code and state regulations is not discrimination. Rather, it is simply complying with
the zoning and general plan standards that the City lawfully adopted. The FHAA does not
require all housing units constructed in the United States to be constructed to accommodate
memory care patients. Following the law will not prevent memory care facilities from being
built in all of Orinda; it will only prevent this particular non-qualifying, for-profit facility from
being built on this particular site that is limited to Public and SemiPublic uses.

Respondents Failed to Apply the Required Heightened Scrutiny to the Project Application
9
45. In approving the Project after it was shoehorned into the form of a "congregate 10
care facility" (which it clearly is not), Respondents failed to follow the procedure and standards
11 required by the Municipal Code. As noted above, under the Municipal Code, for PS-zoned land, 12 "any changes in existing uses (with the exception of new emergency shelters)" are subject to a ITI 'DNOHLSWHV 13 "heightened level of scrutiny to assure consistency with the General Plan." OMC 17.9.1. Here,
14 no such heightened scrutiny occurred.
15
46.

17 the Municipal Code sections pertaining to PS zoning identify certain accessory uses and
18 structures that would constitute a change in existing uses (triggering heightened scrutiny) while
19 not requiring use permits. OMC Schedule 17.9.2. The use permit and heightened scrutiny
20 requirements are not synonymous. Respondents were required to apply heightened scrutiny
21 before approving the Project. In failing to do so, they violated the Municipal Code, and the
22 approvals should be set aside.

Conservation elements of the Orinda General Plan ("General Plan").

should have denied the Project application. Chapter 2 of the General Plan defines the "Public 15
and SemiPublic" land use classification as follows:
8 16 Sce This category designates uses other than parks owned by a public agency YIHVH or semipublic institutions that are of sufficient size to warrant differentiation from adjoining uses. These are labeled on the Plan map. Examples are public and private schools. (Emphasis added.) 19

20 51. The language in the General Plan makes it clear that "uses" on Public and
21 SemiPublic lands must be owned by a public or semipublic entity. Here, the Project Site is

22 owned by Real Party in Interest 101 Upton Partners, LLC, a private, for-profit developer.

23 52. Further, in addition to the land being wholly owned by a private, for-profit entity,
24 the Project seeks to establish a wholly private, for-profit commercial business and use. The
25 proposed facility will not be owned by a public agency nor by a semipublic institution; it is not a
26 City senior community center or a general services agency. It is nothing like a public school or a

22 Scenic Highway. Additional policies protect these scenic corridors, from protecting a "well-

23 landscaped and open feeling;" using "generous landscaped setbacks;" permitting "the natural

24 environment to be maintained as the dominant visual element; and ensuring that structures are

25 "designed to blend and permit the natural environment to be maintained as the dominant visual

26 element." General Plan Circulation Element Section 2.3.2 (Q)-(T).

cJOUA0N 55. The Project directly contravenes these General Plan policies, as it proposes to
locate a singularly large building with meager setbacks along a Scenic Corridor and Scenic
Highway. Because the project builds out the entirety of the small parcel, it neither blends with
nor permits the natural environment to be maintained as the dominant visual element.

The Project is inconsistent with the General Plan Housing Element

56. The proposed location of the Project is at odds with the General Plan Housing
Element because (a) it will degrade the natural setting, and (b) it contravenes recommendations

9 for the location of senior housing.

10 57. Housing Element Policy 1.2 provides that "Where multi-family or mixed use

11 housing is constructed, it should respect the context of the site and its surroundings and make a

12 positive contribution to the character of Orinda." Here, the Project's flagrant incongruity with its
ARMSTRONG, LLP 13 surroundings - a large building on an open hillside - make it inconsistent with this policy. In

14 fact, the Housing Element elsewhere suggests that senior housing should be located near

15

8 16 transit. (Housing Element, Page 6-1). Taking these statements together, it is clear that an open

JaJHVH ES6S-858 (OTS) XVA • SSY8-OZT (0IS) INOHI 1634 Telegraph Ave., #3, Oakland, CA, 94612 downtown, to utilize "vacant and underutilized sites" and to provide proximity to services and

hillside far from downtown Orinda and any services and public transportation is exactly the
17 wrong place to locate a high-density senior housing development. Furthermore, the Project will
18 be located essentially on the on-ramp of Highway 24, potentially subjecting a medically
19 vulnerable population to increased air pollution impacts.
20
58 The Project is inconsistent with the General Plan Conservation Element

22 58. The Project is inconsistent with the Conservation Element Guiding Policies cited

23 in the DEIR. These include guidance requiring Orinda to "protect visually prominent ridgeline

24 and hillside from development" (Guiding Policy 4.1.1 (G)), and to preserve "[o]pen space to the

25 north and west of the Planning Area adjacent to watershed areas and parks." Guiding Policy

HN 0• 59. By approving a project that conflicts with the Orinda General Plan, Respondents
prejudicially abused their discretion and violated provisions of the State Planning and Zoning
Law, requiring invalidation of Respondents' approvals.

Third Cause of Action - Violation of CEQA - Inadequate EIR (Pub. Res. Code 88 21000 et
seq., CEQA Guidelines 14 Cal. Code Regs. $ 15000, et seg.)

60.

9 61. Petitioner hereby incorporates each and every allegation set forth above.

10 CEQA was enacted by the Legislature to ensure that long-term protection of the

11 environment be the guiding criterion in public decisions. CEQA requires the lead agency for a

12 project with the potential to cause significant environmental impacts to prepare an EIR for the

ARMSTRONG, LLP ES6S-858 (0lS) X 13 project that complies with the requirements of the statute, including, but not limited to, the

14

15 provide sufficient environmental analysis such that the decisionmakers can fully consider

d 1634 Telegraph Ave., #3, Oakland, CA, 94612 requirement to analyze the project's potentially significant environmental impacts. The EIR must

HARPER HONE (510) 420-8455 16 environmental consequences when acting on the proposed project. Such analysis must include

17 and rely upon thresholds of significance that are based on substantial evidence in the record.

62.

18 CEQA also mandates that the lead agency analyze and adopt feasible and

19 enforceable mitigation measures that will reduce or avoid any of a project's significant

20 environmental impacts. If any of the project's significant impacts cannot be mitigated to a less

21 than significant level, then CEQA bars the lead agency from approving a project if a feasible

22 alternative is available that would meet the project's objectives while avoiding or reducing its
significant environmental impacts.

23 63.

24 CEQA requires that substantial evidence in the administrative record support all

25 of the agency's findings and conclusions, including those contained in the EIR, and that the

26 agency explain how the evidence in the record supports the conclusions the agency has reached.

64.

27 Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in

28 a manner required by law. The Project flouts the requirements of the Orinda General Plan,

Case No. Wilder Owners' Association v. City of Orinda; et al. Petition for Writ of Mandate 15

Orinda Municipal Code, and the California Streets and Highway Code, but these inconsistencies
61 were not accurately represented or discussed in the EIR, resulting in a wildly inaccurate a
description of the Project's environmental setting. The EIR also fails to satisfy CEQA's
requirements for the disclosure, analysis, mitigation, reduction, and /or avoidance of significant
environmental impacts from the Project including aesthetic, land use, fire and emergency
services, hydrology, utility, and traffic impacts. Finally, the alternatives analysis in the EIR is
• % inadequate because it fails to consider any alternatives that would truly mitigate the
environmental impacts of the Project.
9 65. Environmental Setting. The EIR fails to comply with CEQA's requirement to
10 provide an adequate and accurate description of the environmental setting of the Project area.
11 Because the EIR does not identify the glaring inconsistencies between the Project and the Orinda
12 General Plan, Orinda Municipal Code, and the California Streets and Highway Code, the EIR
ARMSTRONG, LLI 719V6 VO PUEPEO 'E# "aAV qde SOP PE9T 13 hides the fact that the Project is actually not allowed under the current General Plan designation
14 and Municipal Code. Because the EIR inaccurately describes the regulatory framework

15 applicable to the Project, the EIR misrepresents the impacts of the Project and thus does not

16 serve CEQA's primary purpose to demonstrate that Respondents have considered the 8
JAdUVH SS6S-858 (0TS) XVI • SST8-OCP (OLS) INOH 17 environmental impacts of a proposed project. Consequently, the EIR fails in its fundamental

18 purpose: to be an informational document.

19 66. Aesthetic Impacts. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and / or

20 mitigate the Project's direct significant and cumulative aesthetic impacts. These include, inter

21 alia, the following:

22 a. The Project's substantial impacts on public scenic vistas, such as views from
23 heavily used Quarry Hill and other areas with public trails, and the inadequate
visual studies that were performed. Ts b. The Project's substantial impacts on scenic resources, including the Highway 26 24 Scenic Corridor.

HNmt C. The degradation of the existing visual character or quality of the Project
setting that will result from locating the Project, a large, dense, built-out lot,
next to the Wilder neighborhood, with its low-rise homes with large setbacks.

d. The Project's substantial impacts from light pollution on nighttime skies that
will be caused by the Project's lighting for its main building, parking area, and
loading dock. The adjacent Wilder neighborhood has a specific "Dark Skies"

67. policy to prevent obtrusive lighting from interfering with dark nighttime skies.

9 Land Use Impacts. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and / or

10 mitigate the Project's direct significant and cumulative land use impacts. These include, inter

11 alia, the following:

23 68.

24 Fire and Emergency Services Impacts. The EIR fails to adequately disclose,

25 analyze, and / or mitigate the Project's direct significant and cumulative impacts to fire and

26 emergency services. The Project will likely result in increased emergency services calls, and its
location will require emergency vehicles to travel on Highway 24, resulting in increased,

simply concludes that there will be no significant impacts.

69. Hydrology Impacts. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and / or
mitigate the Project's direct significant and cumulative hydrology impacts. These include an
inadequate discussion of the drainage and runoff impacts of a Project site that will be almost
entirely paved, the additional runoff that will be generated, and the capacity of proposed runoff
treatment facilities and features.

11 Utility Impacts. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and / or mitigate

12 the Project's direct significant and cumulative utility impacts. In order for the Project to receive

capacity, and infrastructure should be specifically addressed in any future annexation

17 application. However, these factors are not discussed in the EIR.

71.

18

19 Traffic and Traffic Safety Impacts. The EIR fails to adequately disclose,

Eg analyze, and or mitigate the Project's direct significant and cumulative traffic and traffic safety
impacts. These include, inter alia, the following:

22 a. The impacts of inadequate sight lines resulting from the proximity of a sharp

23 90-degree turn of Wilder Road at the southeast corner of the Project site, and
the exit from the Project's parking lot.

24

25 b. The impacts of rush hour traffic. Traffic studies in the EIR were conducted

26 during traditional rush hours, rather than the actual rush hours that would

27 impact the Project area, such as sports events, and events at the Arts and
Garden Center.

28

Case No.
Petition for Writ of Mandate Wilder Owners' Association V. City of Orinda; et al. 18

C. There is an inadequate consideration of evacuation efficiency in emergency
situations.

72. Alternatives. CEQA requires that an agency consider alternatives to a proposed
Project in an EIR. This is a key CEQA requirement that allows decisionmakers to fully consider
environmental impacts and to lessen or avoid them where feasible. An alternate location for a
proposed project should be considered as part of this analysis:

"An EIR shall describe range of reasonable alternatives to the project,

10 or to the location of the project, which would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any

11 of the significant effects of the Project." 14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15126.6 (emphasis added).

12 73.

ARMSTRONG, LLP 13 Because the EIR's analysis of environmental impacts is so inadequate, the

14 alternatives analysis for the Project is also woefully inadequate. Only three alternatives were

15

16 would reduce the size of the Project by 10%; and a Screened Truck Loading Area Alternative,

HARPER 17 which would add landscaping to the Project's truck loading area. But no alternative project

18 location was considered. Given CEQA's requirements, this is a glaring omission. None of the a

19 minimal tweaks Respondents analyzed here as "alternatives" addressed the significant

20 environmental impacts of siting an outsized building in open space that is out of proportion to
everything around it.

E.1.a

Wilder Road

The City Council hereby approves the Project described above and finds that, with
the conditions of approval attached in Exhibit 2, the Project complies with the applicable standards of the Orinda Municipal Code. The applicable standards are contained below in bold typeface followed by the City Council's findings.

General Plan Consistency The General Plan includes numerous goals and policies pertaining to land use and design, growth management, circulation, community facilities and utilities, open space and conservation, health, safety, and noise. The proposed Project would abide by all applicable goals and policies included in the adopted General Plan.
The project site is designated Public and Semipublic in the Orinda General Plan. The Public and Semipublic "category designates uses other than parks owned by a public agency or semipublic institution that are of sufficient size to warrant differentiation from adjoining uses. These are labeled on the Plan map. Examples are public and private schools.'

The project site is a five-sided, 1.1-acre parcel located between State Route 24, EBMUD property and Wilder Fields. State Route 24 and a wireless communications facility monopole and associated equipment area are located north of the project site, EBMUD property is located to the south, Wilder Fields are
located to the east, and the right-of-way for Wilder Road and State Route 24 are
to the west. The State Route 24 corridor is also designated Public and Semipublic. The EBMUD property is designated Utility. The Wilder Fields area is designated Gateway Valley Planning Area.

The Wilder Fields contain light towers on two of the five fields, which are utilized during dusk and dark and are visible from State Route 24. The project site is nearly
flat with an average slope of 6.2 percent and is not located on a hillside or ridgeline. The project would balance the proposed earthwork on site (1,100 cubic yards of cut and 1,100 cubic yards of fill) to step the structure down the site. The project Commission Approval) Appeal of Planning VOM Peoy J3PI!M Wilder Road (2310: geotechnical investigation concluded that the site is suitable for support of the * proposed improvements.

The PS district (Public, Semi-Public and Utility district) allows for congregate care facilities with a use permit. Through the City's design review standards, the project is required to be evaluated by the reviewing body for its siting and neighborhood context, design, impacts on privacy, and landscaping. The project would construct
a partial two-story Craftsman-style building that would comply with setback requirements and requests a 3-foot exception to the maximum allowed height (30 feet tall where 27 feet is allowed) and an exception for a portion of a front yard retaining wall exceeding four feet in height in the front yard setback and exceeding
eight feet outside of the front yard setback (maximum height of approximately 10 feet), where maximum heights of 4 feet (within the front yard setback) and 8 feet
(outside of the front yard setback) are allowed by zoning. Due to the lack of nearby o jeeddy iz-zo uognjosey quewyoen

residential structures from which the project would be visible, the project would not have significant privacy impacts.

The project's proposed new trees and groundcover would complement the surrounding environment. High ambient noise levels exist in the project area due to automobile activity on State Route 24 and, to a lesser extent, Wilder Road. The project would cause incremental increases in automobile activity on State Route 24 and Wilder Road, resulting in minor increases to existing noise levels. Additionally, mechanical features of the structure, such as heating and air conditioning units, would be required to comply with the City's decibel limits. The project would also be subject to the requirements of the California Building Code, which include design safety features such as egress, fire sprinklers, and other fire protection features.
The project would be consistent with the General Plan based on:
The limited grading and disturbance of existing land contours proposed by the
project;
The relatively level topography (not located on a hillside),
The adjacent freeway, EBMUD, and sports field land uses,
The project's one- and two-story Craftsman-style design,
The lack of nearby residential structures from which the project would be visible;
and the proposed new trees and groundcover which would complement the
surrounding environment.

OMC Title 17 - Zoning The Council finds that the proposed project meets the standards prescribed in OMC Title 17 as follows:
The project site is located in the PS district (Pubic, Semi-Public and Utility
district). Orinda Municipal Code (OMC) §17.9.1 includes the following introductory text for the PS district:

The specific purpose of the PS public, semi-public and utility district is to preserve established patterns of diverse uses such as the high-intensity community center and the East Bay Municipal Utility District ("EBMUD") filter plant and the undeveloped lands of the EBMUD watershed and to subject any changes in existing uses (with the exception of new emergency shelters) to a
heightened level of scrutiny to assure consistency with the general plan. ›jeaddy LZ-ZO uounjosay nuawypen

The project falls under the City's definition of Congregate Care Facilities (OMC §17.2), which is defined as follows:

"Congregate care residential" a means a facility which provides twenty-four (24) hour nonmedical care of persons in need of personal services, supervision or assistance essential for sustaining the activities of daily living or for the protection of the individual. The facility contains small individual dwelling units of usually only one (1) or two (2) rooms with a small kitchen allowing for independent living but also provides common dining, housekeeping, recreational and social facilities. Health and Safety Code Sections 1502(a)(1); 1597.43. Small kitchens that comply with state and local standards must be included in each individual
dwelling unit for this definition to apply.
OMC §17.9.2 allows Congregate Care Facilities with a General Use Permit in the PS district, therefore subjecting the project to the City's General Use Permit Standards (OMC §17.31.2), as further detailed below. Furthermore, the PS District does not specify development standards such as setbacks and building heights. Instead, OMC Section 17.9.3 states that "Property development standards shall be as required by the closest residential or downtown district
base regulations. In addition, all development shall be subject to Chapter 17.15, Development Standards for All Uses, and Chapter 17.16, Off-Street Parking and Loading, of this title.' In this case, the nearest "residential or downtown district"
is the RL-6 district located approximately 3,000 feet from the subject parcel. (The Wilder community, which includes both residential and public uses, is not zoned residential but rather Planned Development; therefore its development standards do not apply to nearby parcels zoned PS.)

The current and applicable air quality plan is the BAAQMD Bay Area 2017 Clean Air Plan: Spare the Air, Cool the Climate (2017 CAP). The 2017 CAP was developed based on computer modeling and analysis of existing air quality monitoring data and emissions inventories and incorporated traffic and population growth projections prepared by MTC and ABAG, respectively. The traffic and population growth projected for the project is accounted for in the 2017 CAP; therefore, the project complies with rules, regulations and standards of the BAAQMD.

B. Hazardous Materials, Combustibles and Explosives. Any use involving handling and storage of hazardous materials, combustibles and explosives that is subject to a permit under the fire code as adopted by the city, the County Hazardous Waste Management Plan (HWMP) or state law. In addition to the provisions contained within the County HWMP, the city adopts the following additional siting requirements for all hazardous waste facilities: 1.Any application to establish a hazardous waste facility shall require an amendment to the Orinda general plan text and map to establish a land use designation which allows for such a facility; and 2.A hazardous waste facility may not be located in an area which may adversely impact a drinking water reservoir, either directly or indirectly.
The project would not establish a hazardous waste facility. A permit would be required for storage of hazardous materials, combustibles and explosives under the fire code. A project-specific condition has been included that would require the applicant to apply for a permit (or produce a document from the Moraga- Orinda Fire District (MOFD) stating that no such materials are proposed) for any storage of hazardous materials, combustibles and explosives under the fire code prior to building permit final.

C. Glare.
1. From Glass. Mirror or highly reflective glass may not cover more than twenty (20) percent of a building surface visible from a street a unless an applicant submits information demonstrating to the (jexouddy uojssjwwoo bujuueld jo jeaddy VOM PeOH J3PIIM L: OLEZ) peoy J3pi!M
F
satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator that use of such glass will 5
not significantly increase glare visible from an adjacent street and property or pose a hazard for moving vehicles.
2. From Outdoor Lighting. Parking lot lighting must comply with Chapter 17.16 of this title. Security lighting may be indirect or diffused, or be shielded or directed away from an R district within one hundred (100) feet. Lighting for outdoor court or field games within three hundred (300) feet of an R district or Scenic Corridor requires approval of a use permit, processed in accordance with provisions of this title.
Highly reflective glass is not being proposed for the building. Attachment: Resolution 02-21 Appeal

The project proposes downward directed outdoor lighting on posts that would have maximum illumination at ground level within that parking area of two foot- candles of less and be less than 16 feet tall, thus meeting the City's outdoor lighting glare performance standard.

Maximum Noise Standards by Zoning District PS: Maximum Decibel Noise Level (Ldn) - 60

The project noise analysis found that the project alone would generate traffic noise leveis of approximately 42.0 dBA Leq. Additionally, mechanical features of the structure, such as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) units, would be subject to the City's 45 dBA decibel limit. Therefore, the project would not exceed the maximum decibel noise level (Lan) for the PS district.

§17.30.5 - Basic Design Review Standards
A Design Review Permit is requested to build a new structure in the PS district.

A. Standards. To approve a project or to approve it with conditions, the decision- maker shall make findings of fact to support each of the following standards:
1. Siting and Neighborhood Context. The proposed development is designed and located on the site so that it is visually harmonious with, but not necessarily identical to, other structures in the neighborhood. The proposed development is designed to blend into the existing landscape and natural context, protect undeveloped ridgelines and hillsides, maintain the dominance of wooded and

vistas. open ridges and hillsides, and preserve significant or unique scenic

The project site is a five-sided, 1.1-acre parcel located between State Route 24, EBMUD property and Wilder Fields. A wireless communications facility monopole and associated equipment area are located north of the project site. The site is nearly flat with an average slope of 6.2 percent and is not located on a hillside or ridgeline. Adjacent to residential districts and peod J8pIIM (2310: 1 Wilder Road WOA Appeal of Planning Commission Approval) .

subject to residential design criteria, the project would construct a partial "

two-story Craftsman-style building that would comply with setback 6 °

requirements and requests a 3-foot exception to the 27 foot maximum allowed height. As shown in the project plans and the project color and materials board, the project would utilize colors and materials that blend in
with the existing landscape and natural context of the project area. Therefore, staff believes the project would be designed to blend into the existing landscape and natural context, protect undeveloped ridgelines and hillsides, maintain the dominance of wooded and open ridges and hillsides, and preserve significant or unique scenic vistas. Attachment: Resolution 02-21 Appeal (

Resolution 02-21
Page 7 of 14

Packet Pg. 24

E.1.a

1 Wilder Road

2. Design. The design elements are visually harmonious, in scale with the size of the structure, and balance environmental considerations. If the proposed development is an addition or remodel of an existing structure, the existing construction and proposed construction are visually harmonious. Facades and exterior walls shall be designed to reduce the blocky or massive
features of building surfaces and provide articulation.

The project would construct a partial two-story Craftsman-style building.
The building would be articulated by projecting facade features, a chimney stack, gridded windows, and French balconies. By stepping the building down the project site, the project would soften the appearance of the building's two-story elements. Additionally, the project would utilize colors and materials that wrap around the entire building and would blend in with the existing landscape and natural context of the project area. Through wrapping the building's materials and articulation features around all elevations of the project, the design would maintain a scale that would be visually harmonious while reducing blocky or massive features of building surfaces. Therefore, design elements are visually harmonious, in scale
with the size of the structure, and balance environmental considerations.
The project's facade and exterior walls are designed to reduce the blocky or massive features of building surfaces and provide articulation.

3. Privacy, Views, Light and Air. The proposed development does not impair the existing views, block access to light and air or infringe on the privacy of neighbors in a substantial fashion. In considering this factor, decisionmakers shall balance the importance of minimizing impacts on neighboring properties and the applicant's ability to develop the property. The term "view" shall be defined in Section 17.22.4.

The Ranch House at Wilder Park, a rentable facility owned by the City for gatherings, is located approximately 125 feet east of the project site. The Ranch House is located uphill of the project and surrounded by dense (jencuddy uo|ssjwwog Bujuuejd Jo jeaddy vom peoy J8pJIM b : OLEz) peoy J3pI!M
vegetation, which would screen views of the project. A trail located on the 6
adjacent EBMUD property is approximately 300 feet south of the project site. The trail is located uphill of the project and, like the Ranch House, is surrounded by dense vegetation, which would screen views of the project. The nearest residential parcels to the project (at the Wilder subdivision) are currently-undeveloped lots located approximately 2,000 feet to the east on Big Rock Road. The project site would also be visible from other residential parcels within the Wilder community. The project site, which is not on a hillside or ridgeline would be located approximately 200 feet below these lots. Due to the structure being two-stories and situated below and far away from surrounding single-family residential structures, its
impacts on neighboring properties would be minimal. Furthermore, Wilder Fields Park is between the residences and the subject parcel and features of the park (fencing, fields and field lighting, parking areas, etc.) are a Attachment: Resolution 02-21 Appeal (

much more prominent feature of this viewshed. Therefore, the proposed development would not impair the existing views, block access to light and air or infringe on the privacy of neighbors in a substantial fashion.
4. Landscaping. Primary landscaping elements complement and are
appropriate for the structure, the site, and the neighborhood.

Landscaping would be incorporated throughout the site and would include a variety of trees (over 50 trees in total), shrubs, and groundcovers installed in gardens and along the project boundaries. An omamental fence is proposed around much of the site. Several landscaped amenities
are proposed along the front elevation of the project, including a 1,527-
square-foot courtyard, a water wall feature, seating walls, and a bocce ball court. While some of the proposed landscaping is on the approved Wilder Plant Palette (utilized in the Wilder right-of-way and across the street at Wilder Park and the Ranch House), many of the landscaping species are not. A project-specific condition has been included requiring project landscaping to be consistent with the Wilder Plant Palette. With this condition, staff believes the primary landscaping elements would complement and be appropriate for the structure, the site, and the neighborhood.

$17.30.6 - Special Design Review - Very Large Homes
Because the project is subject to the zoning standards of the RL-6 district, which is a residential district, staff has applied the City's special design review standard for very large homes to the project (even though the project is not a home).

1. The development projects the visual character of a home which appears smaller than its actual floor area, employing vegetation and architectural features and details which subdue, rather than 8 (jeAoddy uojssjwwog bujuueld jo jeaddy Vom peoy JAPILM L: OLEZ) peoy 19pI!M accentuate, the prominence of the structure.

The project's well-articulated elevations, with exterior finishes that wrap 5
around the entire building, combined with its extensive landscaping and the building stepping down with the topography of the site, would soften the visual character of the structure. Therefore, the development would project the visual character of a home which appears smaller than its
actual floor area.

§17.32.4 - Exception Standards
An exception is requested for a 30-foot tall building where a maximum height of 27 feet is permitted, thus 3 feet taller than the maximum zoning height.
An exception is also requested for fences and walls pursuant to the requirements of Orinda Municipal Code section 17.4.27. This exception is requested for two jeeddy iz-zo uornjosay Attachment: features.

First, a proposed retaining wall located adjacent to the upper patio along the front of the building (east of the project driveway) would require an exception. The exception is required for a portion of the wall exceeding four feet in height in the front yard setback and for exceeding eight feet in height outside of the front yard setback (the maximum proposed height of the wall is approximately 10 feet). Second, the project's perimeter fence would be located within 5 feet of the property line that is adjacent to a public right-of-way, where zoning allows for a maximum height of 4 feet and for fences to be constructed of completely open material, such as wrought iron. The 6-foot fence located along the freeway would not be subject to the height and open material requirements because it is not considered street
frontage for the purposes of residential fence requirements.
A. The strict application of the respective zoning regulations will either: (1) deprive the subject property of rights enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity and within the identical land use district, because the site's unique characteristics, such as an irregular or constrained size, shape or topography, or limitations created by the site's existing development, limit design options available to the subject property; or (2) serve no land use planning purpose under this title or the general plan because of the
absence of any negative impact whatsoever on the semi-rural character of Orinda or on the privacy, views and general well-being of neighboring properties as a result of the size, shape, location or topography of the site.
The exception requests would meet the first criteria (A.1) above. The site slopes slightly to the north-east. In order to design a structure that responds to this change in topography, the applicant proposes a partial two-story structure that steps down with the site. This results in a design a that minimizes massive features of building surfaces. In order to achieve the stepped design, the applicant has requested a 3-foot exception to the maximum allowed height of 27 feet (for a building with a total proposed (resouddy uojssjwwoo bujuueld jo jeaddy vom peox JapI!M L: Olez) peoy Jepi!M
height of 30 feet) and the retaining wall exception. Additionally, there are
multiple municipal buildings, which are also in the PS district, that exceed 6
27 feet in height. The project's perimeter fence is an essential safety feature to keep the project's memory care residents from wandering off of the project site. Therefore, strict application of the respective zoning regulations would deprive the property of rights enjoyed by other properties in the vicinity and within the identical land use district.
B. The exception will result in development which substantially complies with the intent and purpose of the requirements, including design review, of the land use district in which the subject property is located.

The project site is located in the PS district. Development standards for the
PS district are as required by the closest residential district, which is the RL-
6 district. The project would construct a partial two-story Craftsman-style Attachment: Resolution 02-21 Appeal

building. The building would be articulated by projecting facade features, a chimney stack, gridded windows, dormers, and "French balconies." By stepping the building down the project site, the project would soften the appearance of the building's two-story elements. Additionally, the project would utilize colors and materials that wrap around the entire building and would blend in with the existing landscape and natural context of the project area. The primary structure would meet all setback requirements and the retaining wall exception is necessary because of the slope of the site. The project's ornamental fence would be constructed of open material for much of the frontage of the site, before turning into a solid fence. It is an essential safety feature to keep the project's memory care residents from wandering off of the project site. Therefore, the project would result in development which substantially complies with the intent and purpose of the City's
requirements for the PS district.

§17.31.2 - General Use Permit Standards
A general use permit is requested to operate a congregate care facility in the PS
district.

A. The use is consistent with the Orinda general plan, any applicable specific plan and the purposes of the zoning district in which it is located.
The project would be consistent with the General Plan based on: The limited grading and disturbance of existing land contours proposed by the project; The site's relatively level topography (not located on a hillside), The adjacent freeway, EBMUD, and sport fields land uses, The project's one and two-story Craftsman-style design, The lack of nearby residential structures from which the project would be visible; and the proposed new trees and groundcover which would complement the surrounding environment. (jexouddy uo;ssjwwog bujuueld jo jeaddy õ VOM PEO JSPIIM L: OLEZ) PEOd JSPI!M

The project is not within any specific plan area. E

The project site is located in the PS district. The purpose of the PS district is to:
"preserve established patterns of diverse uses such as the high-intensity community center and the East Bay Municipal Utility District ("EBMUD") filter plant and the undeveloped lands of the EBMUD watershed and to
subject any changes in existing uses (with the exception of new emergency shelters) to a heightened level of scrutiny to assure consistency with the general plan."
Congregate care facilities are an allowable use in the PS district upon issuance of a use permit. Attachment: Resolution 02-21 Appeal

Therefore, the use would be consistent with the Orinda general plan and the
purposes of the zoning district in it which it is located.

B. The use is of benefit to Orinda residents.

The project would create the first memory care facility in Orinda. It would provide Orinda families with a housing option for family members in need of memory care living assistance. In addition, according to the project proponent, the project would create approximately 50 jobs (a maximum of 10 employees would be present on site at once).

C. The use will be properly related to other adjacent land uses and to transportation and service facilities in the vicinity.
Adjacent land uses include Wilder Fields, EBMUD land, the Ranch House at
Wilder Park, a wireless communications facility monopole, and right-of-way for State Route 24 and Wilder Road. The project would include 38 assisted-living
units, a parking area with 16 parking spaces and a vehicle turn-around adjacent to the front and delivery entrances. The project sponsor anticipates having 50 full/part-time employees with a maximum shift of 10 employees at any one time. The facility would be operated by employees 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Transportation service facilities in the vicinity include automobile access on Wilder Road and State Route 24, which will also be utilized by a future Wilder Shuttle, and the Orinda BART station, approximately 1 mile east 1 of the project site along State Route 24. The project traffic analysis found the project would generate 17 daily peak hour automobile trips, which could be accommodated without creating unacceptable conditions during peak commute hours, according
to the project traffic analysis. A condition of approval has been prepared for the project to construct and maintain a stop for the Wilder Shuttle that is adjacent to the project site as well as to contribute financially toward the maintenance and operation of the shuttle, subject to approval by the Wilder HOA. If the Wilder HOA does not desire to have the project participate in the shuttle operations or if at some point in the future the shuttle is no longer required, then this condition .: OLEZ) peoy JapU!M Wilder Road WOA Appeal of Planning Commission Approval)

would no longer be required. -

The use would be aesthetically compatible with the area and not create
unacceptable traffic conditions. Additionally, as detailed in the noise analysis
below, the project would only result in incremental increases in noise. Lastly, the project would not create any significant and unavoidable impacts. Therefore, with the above-referenced condition, the use would be properly related to other adjacent land uses and to transportation and service facilities in the vicinity.
D. Under all the circumstances and conditions of the particular case, the use will not have a material adverse effect on the health or safety of persons residing or working in the vicinity. Attachment: Lz-zO uounjoset o jeeddy

Building and Fire Safety
The project would be subject to the requirements of the California Building Code, which includes design safety features such as egress, fire sprinklers, and other fire
protection features.

Emergency Services Study BAE was hired by the City to conduct a Fire/EMS Impacts Analysis (Emergency Services Study) for the project. The study concludes that the project would result in an EMS service demand increase of 1.7% and that the project would likely result in a net fiscal benefit to MOFD.

Evacuation Study
Kittelson was hired by the City to conduct an evacuation study for the project. The study found the project would increase the volume-to-capacity ratio on Wilder Road (west of the project driveway) by 1% (from 67% to 68%) and that project would not have a material adverse effect on the health or safety of persons residing or working in the vicinity under evacuation conditions.

Air Quality for Persons Residing and Working in the Vicinity
Future residents of the project site could be exposed to elevated levels of toxic air contaminants from vehicle emissions from State Route 24, which has travel lanes located close to the project site. Staff recommends a project-specific condition that prior to building permit final, the project proponent shall provide a memorandum from a qualified professional certifying that the required measures have been implemented.
a. All windows will be double glazed to reduce exposure to air pollution.
b. MERV 13 filters (or above) shall be installed on the air handling units for project HVAC systems and a system shall be established to replace filters as recommended by the manufacturer (at least quarterly). (jenoddy uojssjuwoo Bujuueld jo jeaddy vom peoy J3PIIM L: OLEZ) Wilder Road

C. Outdoor air intakes for HVAC systems shall be located as far as possible from the freeway and freeway on-ramp and the
project parking and delivery areas.

E. The use will not contribute to a substantial increase in the amount of noise
or traffic in the surrounding area.
High ambient noise levels (between 62-73 dBA Loq) exist in the project area due to automobile activity on State Route 24 and, to a lesser extent, Wilder Road. The project traffic analysis found the project would generate 17 daily peak hour automobile trips. With these additional trips and trips from approved projects and background growth in the area, all study intersections (Wilder Road and State Route 24 Eastbound Ramps; Wilder Road and Project Driveway) would continue to have acceptable conditions during the weekday morning and afternoon peak Attachment: Resolution 02-21 Appeal (

hours. Additionally, mechanical features of the structure, such as heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) units, would be subject to the City's 45 dBA decibel limit. The project noise analysis found that the project alone would generate traffic noise levels of approximately 42.0 dBA Leq. Due to the existing ambient noise levels in the project area, the noise from project traffic noise and HVAC units would not result in a perceptible difference in what people could hear or measure, according to the project noise analysis. Therefore, the project would not contribute to a substantial increase in the amount of noise or traffic in the
surrounding area.

On July 6, 2018, the City distributed a Notice of Preparation ("NOP") of an EIR for the Project. The NOP solicited comments from public agencies and the general public regarding the scope of the EIR. Publication of the NOP initiated a public review and comment period that began on July 6, 2018 and ended on August 6, 2018. The City Planning Department, in preparing the Draft EIR, considered all of the public's comments, including all public correspondence related to the Project to date.

On March 29, 2019, the City released a Notice of Availability ("NOA") of the Draft EIR for the Project, and submitted an NOA of a Draft EIR to the State Clearinghouse at the California Office of Planning and Research (SCH No. 2018072015). The Draft EIR and all documents referenced in the Draft EIR were made available to the public at the City's offices. The Draft EIR was also available for viewing and downloading on a website the City created for the Project, at
https://www.cityoforinda.org/418/1-Wilder-Road---Countryhouse-Memory-Care. 7
The public review and comment period for the Draft EIR ran from March 29, 2019 to May 13, 2019. The City held a meeting to receive public comments on the Draft EIR on April 16, 2019.

On November 20, 2019, the City issued the RTC document for public review. The RTC document includes all comments on the Draft EIR, the City's responses to those comments, and text revisions to the Draft EIR.
On July 14, 2020, the City Planning Commission held a duly noticed public a hearing on the Project and approved the Project and certified the EIR. On July 23, 2020, the Wilder Owners Association appealed approval of the Project and certification of the EIR to the City Council. At a duly noticed public hearing on November 17, 2020, the City Council certified the EIR and denied the appeal, approving the Project.

CEQA Checklist Wildfire Category Clarification On December 28, 2018, the California Natural Resources Agency approved (jexoiddy uojssjwwoo Bujuueld j0 leaddy VOM peod J3PI!M L : OLEZ) peod JaPI!M -
changes to the CEQA Guidelines, including the widely used Appendix G-Initial 6
Study "Checklist." These changes included adding a new CEQA Checklist impact category for Wildfire. These changes were approved while the CountryHouse Memory Care Project EIR was being finalized. Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15007, these changes to the Guidelines apply prospectively only.
Although the Project is not subject to these new guidelines, the City nonetheless addressed wildfire in its environmental review, contracting with an expert consultant to conduct an evacuation study to ensure that the health and safety of nearby Orinda residents, the residents of the Wilder Care Facility, and all other people in the area would not be adversely affected under evacuation conditions.

The findings and recommendations set forth below (the "Findings") are made and adopted by the City Council as the City's Project findings under CEQA and the
State CEQA Guidelines. The Findings provide the written analysis and conclusions of the City regarding the Project's environmental impacts, mitigation measures, and alternatives to the Project.

These findings summarize the environmental determinations of the EIR with regard to Project impacts before and after mitigation; they do not attempt to repeat the EIR's full analysis of each environmental impact. Instead, these findings provide a summary description of and basis for each impact conclusion identified in the EIR, describe the applicable mitigation measures identified in the EIR, and state the City's findings and rationale about the significance of each impact following the adoption of mitigation measures. A full explanation of these environmental findings and conclusions can be found in the EIR, and these findings hereby incorporate by reference the discussion and analysis in the EIR supporting the EIR's determination regarding mitigation measures and the Project's impacts.
The City intends to adopt each of the mitigation measures identified in the EIR. In the event a mitigation measure identified in the EIR has been inadvertently omitted from these findings, such mitigation measure is hereby adopted and incorporated by reference into the Project in the findings below. In addition, in the event the language of a mitigation measure set forth below fails to accurately reflect the mitigation measure as stated in the EIR due to a clerical error, the language of the mitigation measures as set forth in the EIR shall control unless the language of the mitigation measure has been specifically and expressly modified by these findings.
The following section provides a brief description of each of the impacts that the EIR identified as less than significant with adopted mitigation. These descriptions also reproduce the text of the mitigation measures identified in the EIR for each
potentially significant impact.
CEQA Guidelines Section 15126(b) requires a description of any significant (jenojddy uossjuwuoo Bujuueld jo jeaddy VOM peod Jepi!M L: olsz) peoy JepiM
environmental effects that cannot be avoided if the proposed project is 6
implemented. The EIR does not identify any significant unavoidable adverse impacts that would occur due to implementation of the proposed Project.

V. FINDINGS REGARDING POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL
PROJECT IMPACTS THAT ARE REDUCED TO A LESS-THAN-SIGNIFICANT LEVEL BY MITIGATION MEASURES ADOPTED AND INCORPORATED INTO
THE PROJECT AND FACTS IN SUPPORT OF FINDINGS

The Final EIR identifies the following potentially significant impacts associated with the Project. It is hereby determined that by adopting and incorporating the mitigation measures identified in the Final EIR into the Project, these potentially significant impacts will be mitigated to a less than significant level or avoided. Public Resources Code § 21081(a)(1). The findings in this section are based on uounjosey nuawyoen o jeeddy 1Z-Z0

the EIR, the discussion and analysis of which is hereby incorporated in full by this
reference.

A. Air Quality

Potentially Significant Impact AIR-1. The EIR finds that fugitive dust emissions during construction of the Project would not contribute substantially to an existing or projected PM2.5 or PM1 air-quality violation because implementation of the
following mitigation measure, hereby adopted and incorporated into the Project, would avoid or reduce this potentially significant impact to a less-than-significant level.

Mitigation Measure AIR-1: During grading and construction, the project shall comply with the following Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) Basic Construction Mitigation Measures:
. All exposed surfaces (e.g., parking areas, staging areas, soil piles, graded areas, and unpaved access roads) shall be watered two times per day.
. All haul trucks transporting soil, sand, or other loose material off-site shall be
covered.

. All visible mud or dirt track-out onto adjacent public roads shall be removed using wet power vacuum street sweepers at least once per day. The use of
dry power sweeping is prohibited.
A All vehicle speeds on unpaved roads shall be limited to 15 miles per hour. All roadways, driveways, and sidewalks to be paved shall be completed as soon as possible. Building pads shall be laid as soon as possible after grading unless seeding or soil binders are used. Idling times shall be minimized either by shutting equipment off when not in use or reducing the maximum idling time to 5 minutes (as required by the
California airborne toxics control measure Title 13, Section 2485 of California
Code of Regulations). Clear signage shall be provided for construction workers at all access points.
All construction equipment shall be maintained and properly tuned in Wilder Road (2310: 1 Wilder Road WOA Appeal of Planning (jeAouddy uojss|wwog

accordance with manufacturer's specifications. All equipment shall be *
a checked by a certified visible emissions evaluator.
Post a publicly visible sign with the telephone number and person to contact
at the lead agency regarding dust complaints. This person shall respond and take corrective action within 48 hours. The BAAQMD's phone number shall
also be visible to ensure compliance with applicable regulations.

B. Biological Resources

Potentially Significant Impact BIO-1: The EIR finds that the Project would not
potentially harm nesting special-status or common migratory birds because implementation of the following mitigation measures, hereby adopted and incorporated into the Project, would avoid or reduce this potentially significant impact to a less-than-significant level. o jeeddy iz-zo uounjosey quewypen

Exhibit A
Page 5 of 9

Packet Pg. 36

E.1.a
1 Wilder Road

Mitigation Measure BIO-1: In order to avoid destruction, abandonment, or other direct impacts to active nests, the applicant shall submit a breeding bird survey and summary memo by a qualified biologist for staff review if vegetation removal and/or ground disturbance is to occur within the breeding bird season between February 1 and August 31. The biologist shall conduct a survey within two weeks prior to ground disturbance. If an active nest is found, a suitable buffer shall be established around the nest and work will be avoided within the buffer until the
young have fledged or the nest is no longer active. The size of the buffer, as determined by the biologists, will be informed by the nest location, species, and any existing visual or auditory barriers. However, if any if construction work is to be conducted outside of the breeding season (February through August), no breeding bird surveys are required.

Vl. GROWTH INDUCING IMPACTS

CEQA Guidelines section 15126.2(e) requires that an EIR evaluate the growth-inducing impacts of a proposed action. Growth-inducing impacts are defined by CEQA Guidelines section 15126.2(e) as follows:
the ways in which the proposed project could foster economic or population growth, or the construction of additional housing, either directly or indirectly, in the surrounding environment. Included in this are projects which would remove obstacles to population growth .. . . Increases in the population may tax existing community service facilities, requiring construction of new facilities that could
cause significant environmental effects. Also . . . the characteristic of some projects which may encourage and facilitate other activities that could significantly affect the environment, either individually or cumulatively.
The Project would be developed on a site with existing road and utility access and would not result in infrastructure improvements that could foster growth. The Project could result in indirect population growth through providing new job opportunities that (¡exoddy uojssjwwo Bujuueld jo jeaddy VOM peoy JepI!M L : OLEZ) peoy Jepi!M
could cause new employees to move to the City of Orinda. However, the EIR concludes 6
that any population growth resulting from these jobs would not be substantial.

VI. PROJECT ALTERNATIVES

CEQA Guidelines require that an EIR describe a range of reasonable alternatives to the proposed project or its location. The purpose of the alternatives section is to provide decision-makers and the public with a discussion of alternatives that could feasibly attain most of the project's basic objectives and that are capable of avoiding or substantially lessening any significant effects of the project.
The City evaluated three alternatives to the Project, fully described and comparatively analyzed in Chapter 5 of the Draft EIR: Alternative 1 ("No Project/No Build"); Alternative 2 ("Reduced Development"); and Alternative 3 ("Screened Truck Loading"). Attachment: lz-zo uoynjosay Appeal

Exhibit A
Page 6 of 9

Packet Pg. 37

E.1.a

1 Wilder Road

The EIR finds that the Reduced Development Alternative (Alternative 2) would have similar impacts for all environmental topics found to be less than significant in the EIR, although the effects may be incrementally less. However, the reduction in square footage would not be substantial enough to result in a meaningful reduction in impacts. Thus, this alternative is only marginally environmentally superior to the Project. Further, the Reduced Development Alternative would not achieve the key Project objectives to the same extent as the proposed Project. On balance, because both the Reduced Development Alternative and the Project are able to mitigate their environmental effects to a less than significant level, there are only marginal differences in impacts.
The EIR finds that the Screened Truck Loading Alternative (Alternative 3) would have
similar impacts for all environmental topics found to be less than significant in the EIR, and would slightly improve the aesthetic character of the Project by screening the truck loading area from view by planting four oak trees. In all other aspects, this Alternative is identical to the proposed Project and would achieve the key Project objectives to the same extent as the proposed Project. Because this alternative would have the most significant reduction in project impacts from the proposed Project, it is the environmentally superior alternative.
CEQA requires public agencies to make findings regarding the feasibility of project alternatives only in limited circumstances. Public Resources Code section 21081(a) provides that a public agency may not approve a project unless it makes findings, with respect to each significant project effect, that (1) mitigation has been required to reduce the significant effect, (2) mitigation to reduce the significant effect is within the jurisdiction of another public agency and should be adopted by that agency, and/or (3) "[s]pecific economic, legal, social, technological, or other considerations . . . make infeasible the mitigation measures or alternatives identified in the environmental impact report." Pub. Res. Code § 21081(a); see also CEQA Guidelines § 15091(a).
In Mira Mar Mobile Community v. City of Oceanside (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 477, the Court of Appeals confirmed that, where the city found that the only adverse impact of a (jexouddy uojssjwuoo Bujuueld j0 jeeddy VOM peoy I3PIIM L: OLEZ) peoy J3pIM

project could be avoided through the imposition of mitigation measures, "it was not 6
required to make any findings regarding the feasibility of proposed alternatives." Id. at 490 (citing Rio Vista Farm Bureau Center v. County of Solano (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 351, 379 ["CEQA does not require the agency to consider the feasibility of environmentally superior project alternatives identified in the EIR if described mitigation measures will reduce environmental impacts to acceptable levels."], Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Board of Supervisors (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 402, and Laurel Hills Homeowners Ass'n V. City Council (1978) 83 Cal.App.3d 515, 521).
The Project would not result in any significant unavoidable effects. As explained in the EIR, all potentially significant environmental impacts are reduced to less than significant levels by mitigation measures adopted and incorporated into the Project. Accordingly, the City is not required to make findings regarding the feasibility of alternatives. uonjosey quawyoenv o jeeddy iZ-zo

VIII. FINDINGS REGARDING THE MITIGATION MONITORING AND REPORTING
PROGRAM

Section 21081.6 of the Public Resources Code requires that when making findings required by section 21081(a) of the Public Resources Code, the lead agency approving a project shall adopt reporting or monitoring program for the changes to the project that it has adopted or made a condition of project approval, in order to ensure compliance with project implementation and to mitigate or avoid significant effects on the environment. The City hereby finds that:

1. A Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program ("MMRP") has been prepared for the Project, and the mitigation measures therein are made a part of the Project. The MMRP is incorporated herein by reference and is considered part of the record of proceedings for the Project.

2. The MMRP designates responsibility and anticipated timing for the implementation of mitigation. The City's Planning Director will serve as the overall MMRP coordinator and will be primarily responsible for ensuring compliance with all mitigation measures.

3. The MMRP prepared for the Project has been adopted concurrently with these Findings. The MMRP meets the requirements of Section 21081.6 of the Public Resources Code. The City will use the MMRP to track
compliance with mitigation measures. The MMRP will remain available for public review during the compliance period.

X. INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE

These findings incorporate the text of the EIR for the Project, the MMRP, City staff
reports relating to the Project, and other documents related to public hearings on the Project, by reference, in their entirety. Without limitation, this incorporation is intended to elaborate on the scope and nature of mitigation measures, project and cumulative (jexoiddy uoissjwwoo 6ujuueld jo 6 Wilder Road (2310: 1 Wilder Road WOA Appeal
impacts, the basis for determining the significance of impacts, the comparison of the alternatives, the determination of the environmentally superior alternative, and the
reasons for approving the Project.

XI. RECIRCULATION NOT REQUIRED

CEQA Guidelines section 15088.5 requires a lead agency to recirculate an EIR for further review and comment when "significant new information" is added to the EIR after public notice is given of the availability of the Draft EIR but before certification. No
significant new information was added to the Draft EIR as a result of the public
comment process. The Final EIR responds to comments and clarifies, amplifies and
makes insignificant modifications to the Draft EIR. The EIR does not identify any new significant effects on the environment or a substantial increase in the severity of an
environmental impact. Attachment: Resolution 02-21 Appeal (

TREE MANAGEMENT CONDITIONS
1. If a protected tree proposed for removal can be relocated, the applicant shall move the tree to a suitable location on a site shown on the approved plans.
2. The applicant shall guarantee the health and vigor of each protected tree required to be preserved during the construction process and for two years after construction is certified as complete.
3. The applicant shall replace a protected tree that dies during the guarantee period in accordance with the tree-replacement provisions, provided below, of §17.21 of the OMC.

a. Protected-Tree Replacement
i. For each 6-inches, or fraction thereof, of the aggregate diameter of trees approved for removal, the applicant shall plant 1 native tree with a diameter no less than 0.75 inches. One-third of the replacement tree requirement may be fulfilled by planting native shrubs that mature at a height no less than 5 feet. The applicant may substitute a larger number of smaller trees or a smaller number of larger trees if approved by the Planning Director based on a finding that tree replacement will be more beneficial to the health and vigor of all trees on the property.
ii. If the development site cannot accommodate the replacement trees, the applicant may, with the written approval of the Planning Director and the property owner, plant the replacement trees on public or private property located in Orinda. Alternatively, the applicant may make an in-lieu payment of one hundred and twenty-five dollars ($125.00) for each replacement tree otherwise required. All in-lieu payments shall be used for the City's landscape-related projects.

vii. No oil, gas, chemical or other substance that may be harmful to a tree may be stored or dumped within the protected perimeter of a protected tree or at any other location on the site from which such substances might enter the protected perimeter of a tree.
viii. Trenching for utilities shall avoid interfering with roots of protected
trees wherever possible. If complete avoidance of the root zone is
impractical, a tunnel shall be made below the roots. A trench shall be consolidated to serve as many units as possible. Trenching and tunneling within the protected perimeter shall be avoided to the extent possible and shall be done only under the on-site supervision
of a professional arborist.
ix. No concrete, asphalt or other impervious paving shall be placed within the protected perimeter of a protected tree. No supplementary irrigation shall occur within the protected perimeter of a native oak. "6 (jesouddy uoissjwwod bujuueld jo jeaddY Vom peoy Japim L: OLEZ) peod JePi!M
