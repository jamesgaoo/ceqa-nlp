INTRODUCTION

2 1. is This case is substantially related and should be consolidated with BEEP v. CDFW, LA

3 Sup. Ct. Case No. 21STCV03657. This case challenges a project approval granted for the very same

4 project (Ballona Wetlands "Restoration" Project) proposed by CDFW, employing the same EIR and

5 adopting the same findings challenged in BEEP v. CDFW. While there may be some additional parties,

6 the legal issues, the project, the EIR and the administrative record will be similar if not identical to
BEEP v. CDFW and its related cases.

8 2. Petitioners GRASSROOTS COALITION and BALLONA ECOSYSTEM EDUCATION

9 PROJECT (BEEP) challenge the CALIFORNIA STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY (hereinafter

10 STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY or Respondent) approval and funding of CALIFORNIA
11 DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE'S "Ballona Wetlands Restoration Project" (the Project)
12 (State Clearinghouse Number 2012071090.)

13 3. The STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY is a responsible agency under CEQA and
14 because its approval was designed to support the entire project, it was required to consider the adequacy
15 of the entire EIR, and make all the findings under CEQA Guidelines section 15091 for each significant

16 impact.

17 4. Despite substantial evidence demonstrating that CDFW's December 28, 2020

18 certification of the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) and approval of the Project was improper under

19 CEQA, and that there were significant unstudied and unmitigated impacts, on May 27, 2021, the
20 STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY certified the EIR and adopted the findings made by CDFW

21 without a single change or additional finding.

22 5. The STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY granted $1,692,360 to CDFW to prepare

23 additional studies and analysis, most notably because the Army Corp of Engineers (ACOE) rejected the

24 hydraulic and flood control analysis prepared by CDFW, and the ACOE appears unwilling to provide

25 additional funding for environmental analysis under NEPA.

26 6. In addition, the STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY granted $500,000 to Real Party in

27 Interest PREVENTION INSTITUTE to conduct "public outreach" despite the fact that CDFW has

28 already chosen an alternative opposed by the local community that would dredge a large portion of the

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
-2-

1 wetlands and convert historically freshwater marsh habitat into a tidally influenced saltwater estuarine

2 environment.

7. Petitioners allege that the PREVENTION INSTITUTE has been hired to greenwash the

4 environmentally destructive Ballona Wetlands "Restoration" Project, and that any outreach and

5 comments based on such outreach would be akin to re-arranging the deckchairs on the Titanic.

6 BACKGROUND

7 8. The Ballona Wetlands is an approximately 600 acre remnant of what totals 1700 acres of
8 marshy land that existed when the surrounding area was first farmed by European Settlers in the late

9 1800's. The marshes had historically received clean water from the 127 square mile watershed's
10 surrounding hills, natural springs and the Los Angeles River. Natural sand dunes would form along the
11 shoreline at the west end of Ballona maintaining predominantly freshwater wetland system. Saltwater
12 was introduced to the wetlands periodically during extreme storms, when the Los Angeles River
13 breached the dunes, opening a channel to the Santa Monica Bay. Silt from the side-shore current and
14 from the river would close the breach, blocking saltwater intrusion into the marshes for most of the
15 year. When the Los Angeles River made its final shift, outletting at Long Beach, fewer breaches
16 occurred, enhancing the predominance of freshwater at Ballona.

17 9. In 2005, the California Fish and Game Commission formally designated the Ballona
18 Wetlands Ecological Reserve, affording such state-owned land the "best available protection for the
19 species and habitat" under the law. (California Regulatory Notice Register 2005, Vol. 20-Z, at 663;
20 See also, 14 Cal. Code of Regs. 630(b)(10).) California Fish and Game Commission expressly
21 described the freshwater resources at the Ballona Wetlands: "Ballona Wetlands consisting of 553 acres
22 in Los Angeles County is proposed for designation as an ecological reserve for the protection and
23 enhancement of coastal salt marsh and freshwater marsh habitats, and associated species, including the
24 state listed endangered Belding's savannah sparrow. The area is also an important wildlife movement
25 corridor to other public lands in the vicinity of the wetlands." (Id. (emphasis added).)
26 10. Proponents of the Project have proclaimed that the Ballona Wetlands was historically a
27 70% saltwater marsh. This claim is directly contradicted by the US EPA. (See, Ballona Wetlands
28 TMDLs for Sediment and Invasive Exotic Vegetation, pg. 41, US EPA 2012 (*..analysis of the

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
-3-

1 historical ecology of Ballona Creek Watershed suggest these habitats are dynamic and freshwater

2 marsh may have shifted into areas identified as vegetated wetland.") Thus, the Ballona Wetlands was a

3 mixture of habitats, not a 70% saltwater mono-culture. Because a saltmarsh must be at or below mean
4 a sea level, while a freshwater marsh can be at any elevation as long as it is below a water source, to

5 choose a plan that includes constant full-tidal salt marsh means massive disturbance of soil far below its

6 natural elevations, while a balanced fresh and saltwater alternative could be restored with minimal land

7 modification.

8 11. Opening up the wetlands to the Ballona Creek Flood Control Channel will introduce both

9 polluted bay water and urban run-off from the Ballona Channel. Before European colonization and

10 subsequent urbanization of much of the land surrounding the Ballona Wetlands, the freshwater in

11 Ballona Channel was clean and suitable for agriculture and drinking water replenishment. Today,

12 flows in the Ballona Channel violate Federal health standards. The plan at issue here, which will

13 remove the existing levees and flood the wetlands with channel water and bay water, would pollute the

14 wetlands in violation of the Federal Clean Water Act.

15 12. At the time of Project consideration, Project opponents identified three sources of clean

16 freshwater that are near and/or upstream of the Ballona Wetlands. CDFW quickly dismissed such

17 suggestions. The Project at issue would bulldoze and destroy the Ballona Wetlands Ecological Reserve

18 creating saltwater, FULL TIDAL wetlands on a historically diverse wetland, predominantly closed

19 from the ocean, and now very rare coastal seasonal freshwater/brackish water marsh ecosystem.

20 13. While some environmental groups supported the Project, the vast majority of community

21 members, environmentalists, biologists, and restoration scientists who are intimately familiar with the

22 Ballona Wetlands are opposed to the Project and sent detailed comments identifying the impacts,

23 questioning the Project description, and decrying the artificially narrow range of alternatives.
24 14. Numerous individuals and groups strongly supported evaluating an alternative to restore

25 and remediate the Ballona Wetlands as a mixed and predominantly seasonal freshwater marsh system,

26 consistent with the historical and natural topography of the Ballona Wetlands, but such alternative was

27 ignored by CDFW without further analysis. CDFW refusal was particularly perplexing considering

28 public bond funds were approved for studies to provide for a full range of alternatives that would

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
-4-

-

2 "restore" the Ballona Wetlands with the least amount of environmental damage.
15.

3 Despite Project opponents identifying significant unmitigable impacts, neither CDFW .nor

4 the STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY adopted a statement of overriding considerations. It is

5 impossible to mitigate the impacts of excavating, removing and grading 2.5 million cubic yards of

6 sensitive wetland habitat, drastically changing the amount, nature and quality of the habitats. CDFW's

7 findings and decision were arbitrary and capricious, and constitute an abuse of discretion.
16.

8 STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY'S subsequent adoption of CDFW's findings,

9 despite substantial evidence of significant unstudied, unmitigated impacts, and approval of funding for
the project constitutes an abuse of discretion.

10 17.

11 A peremptory writ of mandate should issue ordering the STATE COASTAL

12 CONSERVANCY to rescind its certification of the EIR, and it's adoption of the CDFW's findings (or

13 approval of the same findings), and rescind all approvals for the Project
18.

14 In addition, injunctive relief should issue prohibiting CDFW from making any changes to
the physical environment until it fully complies with CEQA.

15

16 PARTIES

17 19.

18 GRASSROOTS COALITION is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) tax-exempt environmental

19 organization registered with the State of California. Its members have been seeking to protect the

20 Ballona Wetlands for over 20 years. Grassroots Coalition and its members provided detailed

21 comments, photographs, maps and other materials to CDFW on the Project and EIR.
20.

22 BALLONA ECOSYSTEM EDUCATION PROJECT (BEEP) is an unincorporated non-

23 profit community organization that has been seeking to protect the Ballona Wetlands for over 20 years.

24 It was formed by activists who would stand adjacent to the Ballona Wetlands with signs asking drivers

25 to honk their horns to save the wetlands. BEEP and its members submitted detailed comments to
CDFW on the Project and EIR.

26 21.

27 CALIFORNIA STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY ("STATE COASTAL

28 CONSERVANCY") is a non-regulatory State Agency. It is a "responsible agency" under CEQA and
must make the same findings as CDFW with respect to each significant impact that it decides to carry

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
-5-

1 out, finance or approve, which, in this case, is the entire project.

2 22. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE is a State Agency which

3 manages the Ballona Wetlands Ecological Reserve. It was the proponent and lead agency for the

4 Project. As the lead agency, it was required to comply with all the procedural and substantive

5 requirements of CEQA.

6 23. CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE is also the applicant for a

7 grant of funding from the CALIFORNIA STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY, and is therefore an

8 applicant and real party-in-interest related to Petitioners' challenge of the STATE COASTAL

9 CONSERVANCY'S action approving funding for the project, certifying the EIR, adopting findings

10 pursuant to 14 CCR 15091 and 15096.

11 24. The PREVENTION INSTITUTE is a non-profit organization that was granted $500,000

12 by the State Coastal Conservancy to conduct "community outreach" in conjunction with the State

13 Coastal Conservancy's approval of the project. Such grant was approved simultaneously with the

14 approval of the grant to fund the Ballona Wetlands Restoration Project.

15 25. DOES 1-10 are other government agencies or project proponents. The names and

16 capacities of such parties are unknown to Petitioners. However, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

17 section 389(c) and Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5 that such DOES parties are not necessary

18 or indispensable to the action. Petitioners will substitute the true names of DOES 1-10 when their

19 names and capacities are determined and Petitioners determine such substitution is necessary to afford

20 complete relief.
21 26. DOES 11-20 are real parties-in-interest and are either proponents or beneficiaries of the

22 approvals. The names and capacities of such parties are unknown to Petitioners. However, pursuant to

23 Code of Civil Procedure section 389(c) and Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5 such DOES

24 parties are not necessary or indispensable to the action. Petitioners will substitute the true names of

25 DOES 1-10 when their names and capacities are determined and Petitioners determine such substitution

26 is necessary to afford complete relief.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 27. Petitioners bring this matter to the court under Code of Civil Procedure 1094.5, and

3 Public Resources Code §§ 21168. The STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY was required to hold a

4 hearing, review the entire record, and consider the evidence and make findings supported by the
5 evidence.

6 28. Venue is proper in the County of Los Angeles, in that the challenged Project is located in
7 the County of Los Angeles. Venue is proper in the Los Angeles Superior Court, Central District, in the
8 Los Angeles Superior Court Rules, Rule 3.232(b) requires all cases brought under CEQA to be filed in
9 the Central District.

10

11 PRELIMINARY ALLEGATIONS

12 29. Petitioners re-allege and reincorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully alleged herein.
13 30. On December 28, 2020, CDFW, acting a as a lead agency under CEQA, approved the
14 project, certified the EIR and adopted findings pursuant to 14 Cal. Code of Regs. 15091. Such actions
15 were an abuse of discretion, as described herein.
16 31. On May 27, 2021, the STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY, considered an application
17 to approve $1.69 million dollars to further fund Ballona Wetlands Restoration Project, and $500,000 for
18 "community engagement" despite the fact that CDFW had already chosen its preferred alternative.
19 32. Petitioners participated in the administrative process for all the approvals challenged
20 herein, and submitted written comments setting forth the concerns raised in this action. The issues
21 presented in this action were brought to the attention of Respondents during the administrative review
22 process by Petitioners, other members of the public, or internally, during the EIR process by litigation,
23  administrative actions, permits and other means.

24 33. Petitioners have exhausted administrative remedies in compliance with Public

25 Resources Code section 21177.

26 34. The STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY filed a Notice of Determination for its

27 approval and findings on or about June 15, 2021, with the Office of Planning and Research. This

28 action is being brought within 30 days of such filing in compliance with Public Resources Code

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
-7-

section 21167 and 14 Cal. Code of Regulation 15091.

2 35. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to filing this action in compliance

3 with the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by providing Respondents with

4 notice of this action prior to filing the lawsuit, and by filing a proof of service with the court at the time

5 of filing this action.

6 36. In conjunction with the filing of this lawsuit, Petitioners have filed a request for

7 Respondents to prepare the administrative record, which shall be served personally within 10 days of

8 filing of the lawsuit. Petitioners reserve the right to request to prepare the record themselves.

9 37. Within 10 days of filing, Petitioners will provide the California Attorney General with

10 notice of this action, and request that the Attorney General intervene in this action because of the

11 importance of this case to the citizens of Los Angeles and the State of California. It is alleged on

12 information and belief that the California Attorney General has a conflict of interest because it

13 represents the State Agencies that are respondents and real parties-in-interest in this action.
38. Petitioners are entitled to attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 14
1021.5 in that:
15
a. The successful prosecution of this lawsuit will result in the enforcement of
16 important rights affecting the public interest and will confer significant benefits upon 17 the public or a large class of persons. Petitioner seeks to enforce provisions of
18 important state environmental laws for the benefit of the public and to rectify certain
19 procedural improprieties which will benefit all future participants in the decision
20
688% making process employed by Respondents;
b. the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement are such as to make
the award appropriate; and, F:

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
VIOLATION OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT
2 (PETITIONERS V. STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY AND REAL PARTY IN INTEREST
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF
3 FISH AND WILDLIFE, PREVENTION INSTITUTE and DOES 1-10, 11-20.)
4

5 39. Petitioners re-allege all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

6 40. On December 28, 2020, CDFW certified the EIR and adopted findings pursuant to 14

7 Cal. Code of Regulations section 15091. Petitioners allege that the EIR and the approval process violate

8 CEQA.

9 41. The STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY is responsible agency under CEQA.

10 42. Although, it does not have any regulatory role, because the STATE COASTAL

11 CONSERVANCY financed the project it must it consider the entire project, the entire EIR and make all

12 the same findings as CDFW in approving funding for the project.

13 43. The STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY must consider the adequacy of the EIR, and

14 if it disagreed that the EIR was inadequate, it must either deny the application for funding, or become
15 the Lead Agency and prepare an EIR for the Project.
16 44. The STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY must consider all comments on the EIR and
17 on the project, consider all potentially significant impacts, and adopt findings for each significant impact
18 under its jurisdiction that comply with 14 Cal. Code of Regulations 15091.
19 45. Petitioners allege, on information and belief, that Board Members of the STATE
20 COASTAL CONSERVANCY were not provided all the comments, and were directed to review or
21 download public comments from the State Coastal Conservancy website. However, numerous 22

23 comments were not posted on the website in a timely manner, despite timely submission, thereby

24 preventing the Board Members of the STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY from reviewing such

25 comments prior to making their decision. The inability to review all comments and failure to continue

26 it the hearing until it could review all the comments means that the decisionmaker's decision was not

27 based on the whole record. The failure to evaluate the whole record constitutes an abuse of discretion,

28 akin to improperly excluding material evidence at trial.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
-9.

1 46. Petitioners submitted substantial comments on the project demonstrating that the project
2 would have numerous significant impacts, including saltwater intrusion on aquifers, elimination of
3 existing marsh habitat, adverse impacts from sea level rise, impacts on endangered, threatened and
4 protected species, and that the mitigation was inadequate to reduce the impacts of the project to a level
5 of insignificance.
6 47. Members of local Native American Tribe(s), Tongva (Gabrielino Mission Indians),
7 commented that the CDFW and the STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY failed to consult with them,
8

9 and that the project would have significant impacts on a State Listed Sacred site and its surrounding

10 sacred landscape and water.

11 48. The Project Description is misleading, inaccurate and deficient under CEQA. Among

12 other things, it claims to be a restoration project when it proposes to remove existing freshwater

13 wetlands and replace it with non-naturally occurring, full tidal estuarine environment.

14 49. The project goals were artificially narrow and a based on a false premise that naturally

15 occurring tidally influenced marsh existed, despite undisputed evidence that Ballona Wetlands had been

16 a fresh and brackish water marsh that was predominantly closed to the Ocean.

17 50. The EIR failed to evaluate a reasonable range of alternatives, including a freshwater/

18 brackish water marsh alternative that actually fits within the definition of restoration.

19 51. Many of the studies relied upon by the EIR were prepared prior to 2012, more than 10

20 years prior to the approval and do not reflect the current baseline.

21 52. The EIR failed to properly study and describe the baseline current conditions, including,

22 but not limited to, preparing a proper hydrological study of the entire wetlands, identifying the current

23 extent that the wetlands and underlying aquifers were being drained by related development, such as the

24 adjacent Playa Vista Development, and it failed to adequately define the three underlying aquifers that

25 would be negatively impacted by the CDFW plan for full tidal inundation.

26 53. The EIR failed to evaluate the changed circumstances caused by capping the drains that

27 CDFW was required to cap and seal as a result of a lawsuit by Grassroots Coalition. (Grassroots

28 Coalition V. Cal. Dept. of Fish & Wildlife, LASC Case No. BC61944 (2016).) Such lawsuit and the

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
-10-

subsequent improvement in wetland habitat surrounding the drains should have been identified and

2 accounted for in the EIR. Failure to do so rendered the EIR and baseline inaccurate.

3 54. Petitioners allege that the EIR failed to properly evaluate the impacts to the existing and

4 historical gas and oil infrastructure caused by the Project, including impacts to pipes, wells, and other
5 infrastructure that would be adversely impacted by saltwater corrosion due to the increased salinity of

6 the conversion to a full tidal estuarine marsh.

7 55. The EIR failed to properly evaluate the impacts to the aquifers underlying the Ballona
8 Wetlands that would potentially suffer impacts due to increased salinity. Such aquifers are potential

9 sources of drinking water as identified by the Los Angeles Regional Water Quality Control Board and
10 have been used as sources of drinking water in the past.
11 56. The STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY, CDFW and the EIR failed to consider the

12 Sustainable Groundwater Management Act and related laws that require the evaluation of the
13 connectivity of aquifers, groundwater, and surface waters, and the impacts of overdraft of the aquifers
14 on groundwater-dependent ecosystems such as the Ballona Wetlands Ecological Reserve.
15 57. The EIR failed to properly describe, evaluate and/or mitigate impacts to endangered,
16 protected and special status wildlife species, including, but not limited to impacts to the Belding's
17 Savannah Sparrow, El Segundo Blue Butterfly, California Least Tern, Coastal California Gnatcatcher,
18 Least Bell's Vireo, White-Tailed Kites as well as Silvery Legless Lizard and San Bernardino Ringed-
19 neck Snake. Such impacts are not only direct impacts, but indirect and cumulative impacts caused by
20 irrevocable habitat loss and habitat fragmentation.
21
58.
22 The EIR failed to properly identify, evaluate and mitigate impacts to endangered,

23 protected and special status plant species including the Lewis' Evening Primrose and Woolly Seablite.

24 59. The EIR failed to describe its inconsistency with the Coastal Act, most notably, Coastal

25 Act section 30240, which does not permit filling of wetlands or massive berms and excavation of

26 wetlands for the purposes of flood control.

27 60. The EIR failed to describe, evaluate, and mitigate the impacts to climate change and

28 came to the illogical conclusion that the release of massive amounts of CO2 and other climate gases

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
-11-

1 related to the removal of 2.5 million cubic yards of soil and associated vegetation will not have a

2 significant unmitigatable impact on the climate and climate goals. There is a lack of a consideration and
3 study of CO2 sequestration by the existing wetlands soil and plant species, as well as upland soils and
4 plant species. The loss of soils, biology and function due to removal of soils across the Project to be
5 used for fill as berms or transported off site was not adequately analyzed, and the EIR failed to provide :
6 logical rationale to support that such impacts will be mitigated.
7
61. The EIR failed to provide an accurate description and analysis of the impacts of sea level
8 rise on the project, and CDFW improperly buried important maps and analysis in appendices that would

10 have contradicted the agency's contention that the chosen alternative was a superior response to sea

11 level rise as compared to the no-project alternative. The burying of maps in appendices rendered the

12 EIR inadequate for informed public participation and decisionmaking.

13 62. The EIR failed to disclose the locations of the alleged fill that was deposited at the
14 Ballona Wetlands. The EIR failed to disclose that fill was deposited along the perimeter of Area A, and

15 not in the center of Area A where CDFW proposes to excavate.

16 63. The STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY, and CDFW intentionally discarded a draft

17 EIR in 2013 which included a historical description of the Ballona Wetlands freshwater resources,

18 including the Ballona freshwater "lake" that would form.
19 64. The EIR is a mass of errors, inaccuracies and deficiencies such that it fails to serve its
20 purpose for informed public participation and decision-making.
21 65. The EIR improperly segments future portions of the Project and related projects that
22 would be necessitated by the approval of the Project.
23
66.
24 The EIR failed to recognize or disclose the extremely rare regional habitat that coastal
freshwater and brackish marshes represent.
25

26 67. CDFW and the EIR failed to disclose, analyze and properly mitigate the aesthetic impacts

27 caused by the creation of massive berms blocking significant coastal and wetland views. In addition, the

28 EIR improperly relied on inaccurate flood control analysis. CDFW and STATE COASTAL

-12-

F CONSERVANCY improperly deferred analysis that may significantly alter the size and significant
2 impacts of the flood control berms.
3 68. CDFW and the EIR failed to properly study, analyze and improperly deferred study and
4 mitigation for impacts to habitat and wildlife caused by the proposed public access plan.
5 69. The STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY abused its discretion when it failed and it
6 refused to re-circulate the EIR when substantial new information was submitted by Petitioners, other
7
members of the public, scientists, other State and Federal agencies and trustee agencies.
8
70. CDFW's findings were not supported by substantial evidence, and such findings do not 9

10 bridge the analytic gap between the raw data and the ultimate findings. In particular, CDFW found that

11 none of the impacts identified by the EIR, other State and Federal agencies, scientists, stakeholders, and

12 other members of the public were significant unmitigatable impacts. CDFW failed to make the findings

13 required by Public Resources Code section 21081, support such findings by substantial evidence, and

14 failed to adopt a statement of overriding considerations.

15 71. Petitioners allege that the PREVENTION INSTITUTE is a beneficiary of the approval in

16 that the approval granted them $500,000 to sell the environmentally destructive Ballona Wetlands

17 "Restoration" Project" to the public, and, therefore, it is a real party-in-interest and is being named as

18 such in order to allow it to defend its interest in the approval.
19 72. It is further alleged that the approval of the $500,000 for the PREVENTION INSTITUTE
20 is inextricably intertwined with the approval of the project to such an extent that successful litigation
21 will result in the cancellation of the contract, if any, the PREVENTION INSTITUTE has with CDFW
22 and/or the State Coastal Conservancy,
23
73. It is alleged on information and belief that permitting the PREVENTION INSTITUTE to
24
receive funds during the pendency of this litigation, will result in the waste of taxpayer's funds, in that 25
the PREVENTION INSTITUTE will be unable or unwilling to refund such moneys. 26
74. 27 A temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction is necessary to prevent either the

28 STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY or CDFW from paying the PREVENTION INSTITUTE any

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
-13-

1 money in support of the project until this matter is legally resolved.

2 75. Petitioners allege that these actions violated CEQA, and that the STATE COASTAL
3 CONSERVANCY prejudicially abused its discretion by not denying the project, or preparing a legally
4 adequate EIR pursuant to 14 Cal. Code of Regs. 15094 prior to approving the project.
5 76. Petitioners allege the STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY violated CEQA in that it
6 failed to make findings required by law, and its findings were not supported by substantial evidence.
7 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for the following:
8 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate ordering STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY to
9

10 vacate all approvals in support of the Project;

11 2. For a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction and permanent injunction

12 prohibiting the STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY from paying any money to CDFW

13 or otherwise funding the project until it fully complies with CEQA;

14 3. For a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction and permanent injunction

15 prohibiting the STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY or CDFW paying money to the

16 PREVENTION INSTITUTE in support of the Project until it fully complies with CEQA;
17 4. For the court to order STATE COASTAL CONSERVANCY to file a return to writ

18 evidencing compliance with the court's order within 120 days;
19 5. For attorney's fees pursuant to CCP 1021.5,
20 6. For costs of suit herein, and;
21 7. For such additional and further relief as the court may grant in the interest of justice.
