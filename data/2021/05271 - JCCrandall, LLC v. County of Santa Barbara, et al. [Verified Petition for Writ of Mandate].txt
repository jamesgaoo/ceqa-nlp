17 trucks, over the Crandall Parcel. As a result, the County is essentially forcing the

Re: Challenge to Santa Rita Holdings, Inc. Cannabis Cultivation Project;
County of Santa Barbara; JCCrandall, LLC v. County of Santa Barbara,
et al.

Dear Honorable Attorney General Bonta:
Enclosed, please find a copy of the Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate filed by JCCrandall, LLC against the County of Santa Barbara ("County"). The Petition was filed in Santa
Barbara Superior Court and alleges that the County violated CEQA by, among other things, failing to prepare an initial study for the Santa Rita Holdings, Inc. Cannabis Project (*Project"). The
Petition further alleges that the County abused its discretion inasmuch as the County did not proceed in the manner required by law and the decision to approve the Project was not supported
by substantial evidence.

Very truly yours,

ERNEST J. GUADIANA
