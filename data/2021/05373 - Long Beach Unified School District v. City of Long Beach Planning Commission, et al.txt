21 BACKGROUND

22 18. On or about April 4, 2020, 7-Eleven and ASi Development jointly applied for an
23 Administrative Use Permit for the Project from the City.
24 19. The Project is described by Respondents as retail sales of diesel fuel at the site.
25 However, the whole of the Project is a 7-Eleven convenience store with both diesel and gasoline retail
26 sales.

27 20. On February 3, 2021, the Zoning Administrator released a "Notice of Public Hearing"
28 on the Project for February 8, 2021.

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

21.

2 Along with the Notice of Public Hearing, the City posted the February 8, 2021 Agenda.

3 Item No. 3 of this agenda recommended approval of the Project and a determination that the Project is

4 exempt from CEQA, per the Class 32 In-Fill Development Projects Categorical Exemption. However,

5 the referenced technical studies purportedly supporting City staff's recommendations to determine the

6 Project categorically exempt and approve the Project were not included with the agenda and were not

7 posted on the City's website nor made available to the public in advance of the February 8, 2021 public
hearing.

8 22.

9 The District became aware of the Project shortly before the February 8 public hearing

10 only after being informed by a community member but did not have sufficient time to analyze
comment upon the Project at the February 8 public hearing. or

è ORBACH HUFF & HENDERSON LLP 11 23.

12 On February 8, 2021, the Zoning Administrator took public testimony about the Project.

13 Community members voiced concerns with the Project's potential environmental impacts and the lack

14 of transparency displayed by City staff and the Zoning Administrator regarding the Project. The District

15 objected to the Zoning Administrator's failure to conduct community outreach; her failure to conduct

16 adequate technical studies to prove that the Project would not cause a significant air quality, traffic, or
water quality impact; and whether she properly consulted with the District.

17 24.

18 At the conclusion of the February 8 hearing, the Zoning Administrator continued the

19 hearing until March 8, 2021, with instruction to the Project applicant to conduct community outreach
and to disclose the technical studies to the public.
20 25,

21 The City posted the agenda for the Zoning Administrator Hearing on March 8, 2021.

22 Item No. 1 was for the continued hearing on the Project. Included with the agenda were the following

23 relevant technical studies: Linscott Law & Greenspan's Traffic Impact Assessment of the Proposed

24 Long Beach Boulevard & Cambridge 7-Eleven Project, dated October 21, 2020 ("TIA Report");

25 Stantec's Phase II Environmental Site Assessment, 7-Eleven Store No. 41282 (1046369) 6020/6090

2 26.

3 On March 8, 2021, the District submitted a comment letter to the Zoning Administrator

4 highlighting concerns related to the close proximity of this Project (613 feet) to the Colin Powell School,

5 and the lack of analyzing the air quality, traffic safety, and pedestrian safety impacts that the Project

6 may cause to the Colin Powell School's students, faculty, and staff. The Colin Powell School has a
population of approximately 966 students.

7 27.

8 On March 8, 2021, the Zoning Administrator held the continued public hearing on the

9 Project. Various community members testified concerning the inaccurate Project description, the

10 unjustified categorical exemption, and inaccuracies and incompleteness of the Air Quality Report, the
TIA Report, the NIA Report, and other issues. The District's Planning Program Manager and Interim
ORBACH HUFF & HENDERSON d LLP 11

12 Planning Administrator, Tracy Nishihira, testified at that hearing and echoed these concerns and lack

13 of coordination from the City and objected that the technical studies and other analyses did not directly

14 evaluate the Project's potentially significant environmental impacts on the Colin Powell School.

28.

15 After hearing public testimony, including the District's, and statements from the

16 applicant, on March 8, 2021, the Zoning Administrator improperly found that the Project is exempt

17 from CEQA per the Class 32 Categorical Exemption and imposed some conditions of approval, not
relevant here, and improperly approved the Project.

18 29.

19 On March 17, 2021, the District submitted its appeal to the determination that the Project

20 is categorically exempt from CEQA and approval of the Project on the basis of incomplete and

21 inadequate analyses of potential significant environmental impacts on the Colin Powell School.
30.

22 On June 16, 2021, the District submitted its objections to the City staff's
recommendation for the Commission to deny the District's Appeal.

23 31.

24 On June 16, 2021, the Commission heard the District's Appeal. The District's Business

25 Services Administrator, Alan Reising, and Tracy Nishihira, testified to the lack of complete
environmental impact studies that the Project may cause on

26 the Colin Powell School. After taking

27 testimony from the District and others, Commission members discussed the issues with Commission
staff. Afterwards, the Commission denied the District's appeal.

10

= CITY AND COMMISSION VIOLATED CEQA BY FAILING TO PROPERLY
LLP NOSHHONIH 12 ANALYZE THE PROJECT'S POTENTIAL TO CREATE SIGNIFICANT

13 ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS TO THE COLIN POWELL SCHOOL
34.

14 City and Commission violated CEQA by determining the Project meets the definition of

15 the Class 32 In-Fill Developments Categorical Exemption set forth in CEQA Guidelines § 15332(d)

8
ORBACH HUFF 16 ("Class 32 Exemption"), which requires the Commission to show that "[a]pproval of the project would
not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality,
17 or water quality."
35.

18 City and Commission violated CEQA by failing to show that the Project will not result

19 a in a significant traffic impact by using inaccurate Project trip generation numbers, which causes the
Project's true trips and impacts to be understated.

20 36.

21 City and Commission violated CEQA by failing to show that the Project will not result

22 in significant impacts on the pedestrian safety of the Colin Powell School students. Pedestrian safety
relates to traffic.

23 37.

24 City and Commission violated CEQA by failing to show that the Project will not result

25 in air quality impacts by failing to fully analyze the air quality impact on the Colin Powell School.
Specifically, neither the Commission nor

26 the Zoning Administrator analyzed the combined or

27 cumulative air quality impacts from hazardous air emitters within ¼-mile of the Colin Powell School.
38.

28 As a result of the foregoing CEQA violations, City and Commission prejudicially abused
its discretion by failing to proceed in the manner required by law.

7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

39. District has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, other

2 than the relief sought in this Petition, in that City, Commission and ROES 1 through 200's inadequate

3 and missing environmental review and participation in the Project are not otherwise reviewable in

4 manner that provides District with an adequate remedy at law.

5 40. District has exhausted all available and non-futile City administrative remedies required

6 to be pursued by it under the law and circumstances surrounding City, Commission and ROES 1 through

7 200's determination that the Project is exempt from CEQA and their approvals of the Project.

8 41. Without a writ of mandate, City, Commission, and ROES through 200, and each of

9 them, will continue to disregard their duties and continue to violate CEQA by refusing to conduct proper
CEQA review of the Project before implementing the Project. Issuance of a writ is therefore necessary 10

LLP NOSHEONIH HHNH HOFENO 11 to prevent the continued disregard of City, Commission and ROES 1 through 200's duties that have

12 harmed and are harming the District.

13 ZONING ADMINISTRATOR, COMMISSION, AND CITY'S DETERMINATION

14 THAT THE PROJECT WAS EXEMPT FROM CEQA IS NOT SUPPORTED BY

15 SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE. 8
16 42, CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines establish a three-tier process to ensure that public

17 agencies inform their decisions with environmental considerations.

18 43. First, a public agency must review an application for the activity to determine whether
19 the activity is "project" subject to CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15060.)

20 44. CEQA Guidelines § 15378 defines a "project" as the whole of an action, which has a

21 potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment or a reasonably foreseeable

22 indirect physical change in the environment. An activity that is not a "project" is not subject to CEQA.

23 45. If the activity in question is a project, a public agency can make a determination as to

24 whether the project is exempt from CEQA. A public agency may only exempt a project from CEQA if
25 it is exempt by statute, categorically exempt, but not barred by one of the exceptions.

26 46. The City and Commission approved the Project and determined that it was exempt under
27 the Class 32 Exemption despite many members of the public voicing traffic, noise, and air quality

28 concerns and despite the District and other community members identifying deficiencies in its technical

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

reports supporting its determination.

2 47. Further, the District's own traffic expert identified deficiencies in the City and
Commission's traffic analysis, and those concerns went unaddressed. Thus, City and Commission

4 violated CEQA by incorrectly determining that the Project is exempt from CEQA and not supporting

5 its determination with substantial evidence.

7 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

8 WHEREFORE, the Petitioner prays for judgment against Respondents, and each of them, as

9 follows:

Colin Powell Elementary School before reconsidering approval of the Project; and (4) adopt appropriate mitigation measures for any potentially significant environmental impacts to the Colin Powell Elementary School's students, faculty, or staff that are discovered as a result of further
