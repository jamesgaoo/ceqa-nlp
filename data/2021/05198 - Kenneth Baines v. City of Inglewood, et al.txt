VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- Petitioner Kenneth Baines (hereinafter "Petitioner") seeks a writ of mandate

2 against Respondents City of Inglewood and Inglewood City Council (collectively "City" or

3 "Respondents"), and alleges as follows:
INTRODUCTION AND FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 4

1.

6 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000, et seq_, and Govt. Code 5 This petition challenges the City's violations of the California

§§ 6200-6203 regarding the City's: (1) adoption of Land Use Element amendments to the
8 Inglewood General Plan ("Land Use amendments"); and (2) adoption of an Environmental 7

10 furtherance of, and piecemealed from, the larger Inglewood Basketball and Entertainment 9 Justice ("BJ") Element to the Inglewood General Plan, both of which actions were in

Odv J00L 11 Center ("IBEC") project proposed by Real Party in Interest Murphy's Bowl, LLC ("RPI"),
pOSL-LOLL6 VO 'euapesed LAERA Avenue, North Mareng THE SILVERSTEI 12 which, among other things, would become the new stadium for the LA Clippers basketball
13 franchise.

14 2. This action challenges the legal validity of the City Council's June 30, 2020

approval of the Land Use amendments under the claim of "clarifications." It also %
16 challenges the City's decision to treat the Land Use amendments as exempt from CEQA 15

17 review. On or about July 8, 2020, the City filed a Notice of Exemption ("NOF") for the
18 adoption of the Land Use amendments.

19 3. This action further challenges the legal validity of the City Council's June
20 30, 2020 decision to adopt the EJ Element, which approval would relax EJ safeguards and

21 evade EJ requirements. It also challenges the City's decision to treat the EJ Element

22 approval as exempt from CEQA review. On or about July 8, 2020, the City filed a NOE
23 for the EJ Element.

4. This action also challenges the City's approvals of the Land Use and EJ
25 Elements on the ground of piecemealing from the larger IBEC project, whereby the City 24

26 violated CEQA's mandate to study and mitigate the individual and cumulative impacts of
27 the "whole of the action" and all phases of planning, implementation, and operation of the
28 IBEC project.
- 2.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-d 5. Finally, this action challenges the City's acts of altering public records

2 related to the approvals of the Land Use and EJ Elements - including staff reports and

3 Notices of Exemption without providing any notice of such alterations to the public,

4 thereby precluding meaningful public participation.

5 PARTIES

6 6. Petitioner Kenneth Baines is a property owner and taxpayer in the City of

7 Inglewood, and County of Los Angeles. Petitioner's property is proposed to be included

8 in, and the City is threatening to use eminent domain to take Petitioner's private property
9 for, the IBEC project, which is related to the General Plan approvals at issue in this
10 petition. As a stakeholder in the City's CEQA and land use review processes, Petitioner
APC 11 has offered extensive comment on the General Plan amendments, the related IBEC project,
POSI-LOL Floor ajE 'enuany oBueJej 4JON 12 and on the City's multiple failures to comply with CEQA and other laws. Petitioner has

8 EGPTAROY ISEE A SH 13 exhausted all available administrative remedies. Petitioner brings this action on his own
Pasadena, 14 behalf and on behalf of all other City of Inglewood and County of Los Angeles citizens
15 interested in the City's compliance with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and all other laws.

16 7. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that
17 Respondent City a of Inglewood is a municipal corporation organized and existing in the

18 County of Los Angeles. The City has principal responsibility for the approvals described

19 herein, and therefore is the lead agency within the meaning of Public Resources Code
20 Section 21067 and CEQA Guidelines Section 15367 for purposes of environmental review
21 as challenged and alleged in this petition.

22 8. Respondent City Council of the City of Inglewood is the elected City
23 legislative body with the authority and duty to order, certify or reject environmental
24 documents and findings, and was the final decisionmaking body for the actions taken in

25 violation of law, as alleged in this petition.

26 9. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that Real
27 Party in Interest Murphy's Bowl ("RPI") is Delaware limited liability company with its
28 principal place of business in Bellevue, Washington. RPI has been identified by the City
- 3 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- as the applicant for the IBEC project, which Petitioner alleges was furthered by the

2 approved General Plan amendments challenged in this petition, and which Petitioner

3 alleges should have been included in and publicly disclosed and studied as part of the

4 IBEC project and IBEC project EIR.

5 10. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities, whether individual,

6 corporate, associate or otherwise, of Respondent Does through 10, or of Real Parties in

7 Interest Roes 1-10, inclusive, and therefore sues said Respondents and Real Parties in

8 Interest under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this petition to show their true names
9 and capacities when and if the same have been ascertained.

10 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
J001 pC 'anusly obuaew quON APC WHH MVI THE SILVERSTEI 11 11. This Court has jurisdiction over the causes of action asserted in this petition
09L-40W46 12 pursuant to California Constitution Article VI, Section 10, and Code Civ. Proc. §§ 410.10,

8 13 1060, 1085, 1094.5 and 1103.
Pasadena, 14 12. Venue in this Court is proper because Respondents are public officers and
15 % agencies, and this Court sits in the county in which the cause arose. Code Civ. Proc. § 393.

16 13. This Court has personal jurisdiction over RPI because RPI has purposefully

17 availed itself of California's benefits and the controversy at issue arises out of its contacts

18 with California.

19 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

20 14. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of

21 Paragraphs 1 through 13 inclusive, of this petition.

22 15. To attempt to fast-track its IBEC project and minimize and short-change
23 proper CEQA review, RPI secured special legislation, AB 987, which Petitioner contends

24 is unconstitutional, to thereby receive certification of the IBEC project as a type of
25 Environmental Leadership Development Program ("ELDP"). As a supposed ELDP, the
26 IBEC project requires significant traffic and greenhouse gas ("GHG") emission reductions
27 and, as a component, includes the creation of a "transportation demand management

28

- 4 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

program" to manage the dramatic increase of traffic (and the associated GHG emissions)

2 that the IBEC project will generate. Pub. Res. Code § 21168.6.8(a)(6).

3 16. The IBEC project is proposed in an area of the City where preexisting

4 zoning and applicable General Plan designations would otherwise not allow the
5 contemplated intensity and density of the IBEC project, which in turn, necessitated the
6 Land Use amendments at issue herein.

7 17. Further, the IBEC project is proposed in an area of disadvantaged
8 communities and required three General Plan amendments, necessitating the concurrent
9 adoption of the EJ Element and incorporation of EJ policies into the IBEC project.

10 However, those EJ adoptions have failed to safeguard and properly protect the
Floor ,E 'anuary oBuaueN oN: NELSH3ATS 3HL LAW FIRM, APC 11 communities' health and public participation rights.
09L-+0LL6 12 18. The City prepared an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the IBEC

S 13 project. That EIR found that the IBEC project will have approximately 41 environmental
Pasadena, 14  impacts that cannot be mitigated to a level of insignificance. In addition to being fatally

15 flawed on GHG and other grounds, the IBEC project EIR omitted a number of IBEC
16 project components, and engaged in illegal piecemealing, including by using vague and

17 unidentifiable names for various actions taken by the City as part of the IBEC project but

18 yet which the City presented as allegedly "independent" projects, and/or by otherwise

19 failing to identify those components of the IBEC project as being part of the IBEC project.

20 19. The IBEC project EIR was approved on or about July 21, 2020, which
21 approval would not have been possible without the Land Use amendments and adoption of

22 EJ Element challenged in this action.

23 20. Among other things, the Land Use Element amendments designate the
24 highest intensity of 1380% Building Area Ratio (BAR) (total building floor area / site area
25 x 100) to industrial zoning, whereas the separate Land Use Element amendments in the
26 IBEC project changed the commercially zoned lots of the IBEC project into industrial to

27 ensure that the highest 1380% BAR applied to the IBEC project.

28

- 5 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 21.

2 The City failed to include the Land Use amendments of intensity/density

3 challenged in this petition in the IBEC project EIR, but instead limited the IBEC project
EIR's Land Use amendments to the zone changes only.

4 22.

5 The Land Use amendments challenged in this petition were also necessary

6 for the IBEC project to justify its consistency with the General Plan, as required by the
state planning and zoning law.

7 23.

8 The IBEC project proposed amendments to three elements in the City's
General Plan - Land Use, Circulation, and Safety - and therefore required concurrent
9 adoption of the EJ Element, which would identify mandatory policies to safeguard the

10

11 health and public participation of disadvantaged communities and which policies would be

91101-1504 100fd ac 'enueny ofUeJeW qUoN OdV WEId MVT E SH incorporated in the IBEC project as well.

12 24.

8 13 The City failed to include the adoption of the EJ Element as part of the

Pasadena, 14 IBEC project EIR. studies despite the IBEC project's acknowledged EJ violations and other

15 problems, and thereby failed to provide adequate EJ safeguards and analysis in the IBEC

16 project EIR, in violation of CEQA and the state planning and zoning law.

25.

17 The separately adopted EJ Element challenged in this action also failed to

18 provide any genuine mandatory safeguards, and failed to address community concerns
about the City's setting of relaxed and/or illusory standards focused on transit-oriented
19 development - primarily to further the IBEC project.

20 26.

21 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the Land

22 Use amendments may and will have adverse environmental impacts including by enabling

23 the IBEC project's intensity and density, which was found in the IBEC project EIR to
result in various unmitigable environmental impacts.

24 27. Since the IBEC project is proposed on the site where SoFi stadium's
25 overflow parking had been previously contemplated in 2015, the anticipated parking issues
26 associated with SoFi Stadium's opening are also directly associated with the IBEC project,
27 in part enabled by the Land Use amendments challenged in this petition.

28

- 6 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- - 28. The Land Use amendments also designated the highest residential density

2 for the IBEC project, which proposed a hotel development.

3 29. Despite targeted increases of intensity and density, which will particularly

4 further the IBEC project, the City repeatedly misrepresented, described and defined the

5 Land Use amendments as merely a "clarification" of zoning density and intensity in order

6 to understate the scope of the amendments and evade CEQA review.

7 30. The City originally claimed two CEQA exemptions, but then
8 inconspicuously added a third claimed CEQA exemption.

9 31. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that none of
10 the CEQA exemptions the City invoked for the Land Use amendments is applicable to the
11

9L-401L6 JO0L ,C 'enuaxy o6uadeyN qion JOR WES SOARAY OESASSAAHAS SH Land Use amendments at issue herein, or are supported by substantial evidence.
12 32. The City failed to meet its affirmative burden to show, with certainty, that

8 13 there is no possibility that the Land Use amendments and adopted zone density and
Pasadena, 14 intensity designations will result in direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect impacts.

15 33. The City failed to provide adequate analysis of exceptions to the invoked

16 exemptions.

17 34. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the

18 City's adopted EJ Element proposed relaxed EJ standards by listing policies already

19 mandated by other laws, and by proposing vague policies with compliance measures that

20 may not be ascertained and that may not be enforced.

21 35. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the

22 City's adopted EJ Element ignored public concerns about the safety of buses, shortage of
23 parking, safety of streets, and development of stadiums, such as SoFi and for the Clippers,
24 which cause environmental impacts (including but not limited to air quality and GHG
25 emissions) and push rental prices up.

26 36. Contrary to public concerns, the City's EJ Element endorsed transit-oriented
27 developments and thereby furthered the IBEC project, which causes reduced parking and

28

- 7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- forces disadvantaged communities in the City to be exposed to more traffic, air pollution,

2 and GHG emissions.

3 37. The City's EJ Element's transit-oriented focus also disregarded the health

4 and safety of disadvantaged communities in view of recent statistics and findings of

5 adverse impacts of higher density and public transportation usage in spreading various
6 illnesses, including COVID-19.

7 38. As with the Land Use Element, the City originally claimed two CEQA

8 exemptions, but then inconspicuously added a third claimed CEQA exemption for adoption

9 of the EJ Element.

10 39. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that none of
JOOu! uC 'anueny obuaJeN quon OdV WAI MYT ELSHBATIS 3HL 11 the invoked CEQA exemptions are applicable or supported by substantial evidence.
POSL-LOLL6 12 40. The City failed to meet its affirmative burden to show, with certainty, that

8 13 there is no possibility that the adopted EJ Element - with its relaxed and illusory EJ

Pasaden 14 - standards - will result in direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect impacts.

3 15 41. The City's Land Use amendments proceeded without concurrent

16 amendments to the Circulation Element in the General Plan. Instead, and further showing

17 their inter-connectedness as part of the "whole" of the IBEC project, the City approved on

18 or about July 21, 2020 as part of the IBEC project amendments to the Circulation Element

19 to strike the 102nd Street's "collector" street designation in the General Plan and to vacate
20 parts of both 101st and 102nd streets.

21 42. The proposed and now-adopted vacation of two streets to accommodate the
22 IBEC project, and contemplated by the IBEC project at all times pertinent to study of the
23 Land Use amendments challenged in this petition, will allow the 1380% intensity for the

24 IBEC project, while further exacerbating traffic and pedestrian circulation impacts in the

25 area.

26 43. Throughout the administrative process for the Land Use and EJ Element
27 amendments, the City made unexplained and unannounced alterations to the Notices of

28

- 8 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- Exemption and staff reports, including by adding new CEQA exemptions while preserving

2 old dates, in a manner to mislead the public as to these significant changes.

3 44. The City held a special Planning Commission meeting on April 13, 2020,

4 when for the first time it presented the April 1, 2020 EJ Notice of Exemption, listing only

5 two CEQA exemptions. On May 26, 2020, the City held a City Council meeting at which

6 it again attached the Notice of Exemption for the EJ Element, dated April 1, 2020, which,

7 however, was altered in that it noted the same prior two CEQA exemptions under the

8 "Exempt Status" as in the April 13, 2020 agenda packet, but inconspicuously added a third
9 CEQA exemption. Similar occurrences apply to the Land Use amendments NOEs.
10 45. On or about June 30, 2020, City held a City Council meeting during which

11 the City Council rescinded the June 9, 2020 approvals due to Petitioner's notice to the City
POGL-LOLL6 JOOld pS 'enuasy oßuaJeN YUON DdV Wäld MVT THE SILVERSTEI 12 regarding Brown Act violations, but readopted them. The June 30, 2020 City agenda staff

8 13 reports for the approval of both the Land Use amendments and EJ Element contained a
Pasaden 14 two-page "supplemental staff report," which purported to incorporate by reference the

15 % "June 9, 2020" staff report at Attachment 1. The attached "June 9, 2020" staff reports,
16 however, were altered in that they contained additional information and new rebuttals, as

17 compared with the actual June 9, 2020 staff reports from before.

18 46. Because of the old "June 9, 2020" date on both Land Use amendments and

19 EJ Element staff reports, incorporated into the June 30, 2020 staff reports, the alterations of
20 the June 9, 2020 staff reports by the City and new attempted rebuttal information from the
21 City remained largely or entirely unnoticed by the public, and therefore prejudiced the

22 public by depriving them of notice of changed information.

23 47. NOEs for the City Council's approvals of the Land Use amendments and EJ

24 Element were recorded on or about July 8, 2020.

25 48. Petitioner and other interested parties and individuals have made oral and

26 written comments raising the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition.

27 49. Petitioner will serve a copy of this petition on the California Attorney

28 General as required by law.
- 9-

-. 50. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy available in the ordinary

2 course of law to redress the claims alleged in this petition. Petitioner, as well as members

3 of the general public, will suffer irreparable harm if the relief requested herein is not

4 granted and if the City is not compelled to comply with the law.

5 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (Inapplicability of CEQA Exemptions for the Land Use Amendments.)
7 51. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of

8 Paragraphs 1 through 50, inclusive, of this petition.

9 52. CEQA requires the local agency to prepare and certify the completion of an
10 environmental impact report on any project it intends to carry out or approve that may have
APC 11 a significant effect on the environment. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21151(a), 21100(a).
PEGTE 12 53. CEQA requires that no project be approved if there are feasible alternatives MY1 North Marengo Avenue, Floor POSI-LOLL6 VO euepesed MEOSNAA IOS SH 13 or mitigation measures. Pub. Res. Code § 21002. A "project" is defined as an activity
14 which may cause either direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the
15 environment. Pub. Res. Code § 21065(a).
16 54. Exemptions from CEQA'S requirements are to be construed narrowly in

17 order to further CEQA's goals of environmental protection. Azusa Land Reclamation Co.

18 y. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1220. Projects may

19 be exempted from CEQA only when it is indisputably clear that the cited exemption

20 applies. Save Our Carmel River v. Monterey Peninsula Water Management Dist. (2006)

21 141 Cal.App.4th 677, 697. "Where there is any reasonable possibility that a project or

22 activity may have a significant effect on the environment, an exemption would be

23 improper." Wildlife Alive y. Chickering (1976) 18 Cal.3d 190, 206.
24 55. The City's Land Use amendments - despite the City's misleading label for
25 them of "clarification" - was a project as defined under CEQA. The City directly

26 undertook the project of implementing the Land Use Element amendments. Petitioner is

27 informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the City's adoption of the Land Use
28 amendments, among other things, will enable the high intensity and density of the IBEC
- 10 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

project with its multiple acknowledged unmitigable environmental impacts. As a result,

2 the City's Land Use amendments may cause either direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect

3 physical changes in the environment, making them ineligible for use of an NOE. Pub. Res.

4 Code § 21065(a).

5 56. Despite these facts, the City failed to proceed in the manner required by law

6 in that the City did not prepare an EIR, but instead claimed the Land Use amendments to

7 be exempt from CEQA on three alleged grounds, without supporting those findings.

8 57. The City's invoked exemptions under Guidelines §§ 15061(b)(3) and
9 15060(c)(2) are improper as both require an affirmative finding that the project will not
10 have an environmental impact. Such affirmative finding cannot be made in this case. In
APC 11 particular, Guidelines § 15061(b)(3) requires the City to show with "certainty that there is

12

NI3ISH3ATIS 3HL POSI-LOLL6 VO BEATARA 100H .8 'enuary oBuarey qUoN no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant impact"; similarly,
13 Guidelines § 15060(c)(2) applies only if "the activity will not result in direct or reasonable

Pasader 14 indirect physical change in the environment." As shown above and with the example of

15 the IBEC Project, the proposed amendments have the potential to impact the environment
16 directly or indirectly.

17 58. Being "first tier" exemptions and distinct from other categorical exemptions,
18 the Guidelines §§ 15061(b)(3) and 15060(c)(2) exemptions are not entitled to the implied

19 finding that the project will not have environmental impacts, and impose an affirmative

20 duty on the agency to justify the exemptions with substantial evidence. The City failed to

21 meet its burden to show with certainty, based on substantial evidence in the record, that the

22 Land Use amendments would not have environmental impacts.

23 59. The City also inconspicuously invoked a third exemption under CEQA
24 Guidelines § 15305 for "minor alterations in land use limitations in areas with an average
25 slope of less than 20%, which do not result in any changes in land use or density." The
26 exemption is inapplicable since it applies to "minor" alterations needed to address land use
27 limitations to allow specific physical development projects, rather than Land Use Element

28
- 11 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

amendments to the General Plan, which designate high intensity and density, and enable

2 the Clipper's stadium and numerous ancillary uses of the IBEC project.

3 60. Moreover, the City failed to consider or analyze exceptions to claimed

4 exemptions pursuant to CEQA Guidelines §§ 15300.2(a)-(f), including based on unusual

5 circumstances.

6 61. Petitioner further alleges that even if the claimed exemptions would apply,

7 which they do not, exceptions to the exemptions, including on the ground that the Land

8 Use amendments were piecemealed from the larger IBEC project, would apply.
9 62. By attempting to squeeze the Land Use amendments into CEQA exemptions
10 which, on their face, do not apply, and by failing to support those decisions with proper
J00H a€ 'enuary DV DAISTMRAY  IEA S BuerEN qLON 11 findings based on substantial evidence, the City failed to proceed in the manner required
POGI-L01L6 12 by CBQA. Mandate relief as prayed is therefore required.
13 63. Petitioner as well as other members of the public will suffer irreparable 8
asadena, 14 harm if the relief requested herein is not granted and implementation of the Land Use 15 amendments commences or continues without compliance with all applicable provisions of
16 CEQA and other laws.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 17

18 (Piecemealing of the Land Use Amendments from the IBEC Project.)

19 64. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of
20 1 Paragraphs 1 through 63, inclusive, of this petition.

21 65. "CEQA forbids piecemeal review. . . ." California Clean Energy Committee

22 v. City of Woodland (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 173, 193-194. "[T]he lead agency must
23 consider the whole of an action, not simply its constituent parts, when determining whether

7 The City's CEQA approvals as alleged herein are improper and a failure to a

8 proceed in the manner required by law in that the City piecemealed the Land Use

9 amendments challenged in this petition from the IBEC project and its own Land Use

10 Element amendment, and thereby subverted CEQA compliance by "chopping a large

APC Floor project into many little ones .

11
91101-1504 which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences."

*onuexy ouaJen quoN PNES SNASCY HEISSA OS SM 12 Bozung v. Local Agency Formation Com. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 283-284.
67.

g 13 Petitioner alleges that the Land Use amendments were piecemealed from the
larger IBEC project, the EIR of which found dozens of significant environmental impacts
that cannot be mitigated to a level of insignificant, and did in the IBEC EIR disclose,
15 analyze or mitigate the sweeping Land Use amendments to intensity and density
16 challenged in this petition, which directly interrelate with the IBEC project and its

17

18 proposed build-out. As of the time of the approval of the Land Use amendments

19 challenged in this petition, the IBEC EIR was not certified.

68.

20 Petitioner's allegation of illegal piecemealing of the Land Use amendments

21 from the larger IBEC project is also based on the fact that the 1380% intensity adopted as
the intensity for the industrial zoning will allow the precise contemplated height of the
22 IBEC project, and the IBEC project itself requested redesignation of all of its lots from
23 commercial to industrial zoning.

24 69. The Land Use amendments' piecemealing from the IBEC project also
25 constitutes unusual circumstances that further invalidates the City's claimed exemptions.

26 Guidelines § 15300.2.

27 70. By chopping the Land Use amendments out of the IBEC project EIR and
28 invoking CEQA exemptions that do not apply, the City evaded meaningful review of the

1 Land Use amendments' environmental impacts and the "whole" of the IBEC project's
2 environmental impacts. Mandate relief as prayed is therefore required.

3 71. Petitioner as well as other members of the public will suffer irreparable

4 harm if the relief requested herein is not granted and implementation of the Land Use

5 Element amendments commences or continues without compliance with all applicable

6 provisions of CEQA and other laws.
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 7

8 (Inapplicability of CEQA exemptions to the EJ Element Adoption.)

9 72. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of

10 Paragraphs 1 through 71, inclusive, of this petition.
Joold pit 'anuary oßueJeN quoN OJV WYY MVI NELSYEATIS 3HL 11 73. The City's claimed Guidelines § 15061(b)(3) exemption is distinct from
091-LOLL6 12 exemptions listed in 15061(b)(2), and the agency invoking it bears the burden to show with

8 13 substantial evidence that it "can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the

Pasadei 14 activity in question may have a significant effect on the environment." Guidelines §

15 % 15063(b) mandates an environmental study if "there is substantial evidence that any aspect
16 of the project, either individually or cumulatively, may cause a significant effect on the
17 environment, regardless of whether the overall effect of the project is adverse or

18 beneficial." "[I]f a reasonable argument is made to suggest a possibility that a project will

19 cause a significant environmental impact, the agency must refute that claim to a certainty

20 before finding that the exemption applies." Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose (1997) 54

21 Cal.App.4th 106, 118. "Finally, it cannot be assumed that activities intended to protect or

22 preserve the environment are immune from environmental review." Id. at 118-119.

23 74. The City's claimed Guidelines § 15060(c)(2) exemption similarly requires
24 an affirmative finding that the activity will not have adverse environmental impacts.

25 75. The City did not meet its affirmative duty and burden to provide substantial

26 evidence of such affirmative finding of certainty that there is no possibility that the EJ

27 Element may have environmental impacts.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

76. The City cannot show with substantial evidence that the adopted EJ Element

2 which provides relaxed or vague and unenforceable EJ policies and ignored public

3 concerns about transit-oriented development - will not have environmental impacts.

4 77. The City further cannot and did not make the affirmative findings for the

5 exemptions.

6 78. Petitioner alleges that the adopted EJ Element with its transit-oriented

7 development focus - proposing higher density, reduced parking, and forcing people to take

8 alternate transportation means will cause significant impacts on the health and safety of
human beings and expose them to more impacts of traffic, air pollution, GHG emissions,

10 and the spread of various illnesses, where impacts on human life and safety are deemed to
APC Floor 11 be of mandatory significance under CEQA Guidelines § 15065(a).
VOSI-LOLL *enueny oßueJe LION ANE BNISAY TS ASSA OS SA 12 79. The impacts on human health and safety, including because of higher

8 13 density developments and use of mass transit, especially for disadvantaged and low income
Pasadena, 14 communities, have been sufficiently documented and supported by studies and recent
15 COVID-19 pandemic statistics.

16 80. The City's inconspicuously later-claimed third CEQA exemption for
17 | "regulatory agencies" is inapplicable on its face as the City does not qualify as a regulatory

18 agency as defined and referred to in CEQA.

19 81. The claimed exemptions are further inapplicable as the EJ Element was
20 illegally piecemealed from the larger IBEC project, with its multiple unmitigable

21 environmental impacts.

22 82. By attempting to squeeze the EJ Element adoption into CEQA exemptions

23 which, on their face, do not apply, and by failing to support this decision with proper
24 findings based on substantial evidence, the City failed to proceed in the manner required

25 by CEQA. Mandate relief as prayed is therefore required.

26 83. Petitioner as well as other members of the public will suffer irreparable

27 harm if the relief requested herein is not granted and the implementation of the EJ Element

- 88. By not adopting the EJ Element as part of the IBEC project general plan

2 amendments and EIR, the City subverted CEQA's informational mandates by evading

3 timely disclosure and analysis of the EJ issues vis-à-vis the IBEC project, for which the EJ

4 Element approval at issue in this petition was primarily intended to benefit.

5 89. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that by
6 piecemealing the EJ Element away from the IBEC project and its EIR, the EJ Element as

7 adopted presented relaxed and abstract EJ standards, which either require only compliance

8 with already mandatory and existing laws and/or provide vague and unenforceable policies

9 or measures.

18 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

19 (Alteration of Public Records in Violation of Govt. Code §§ 6200-6203 and CEQA's
20 Good Faith Disclosure Mandates.)

21 92. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of

22 Paragraphs 1 through 91, inclusive, of this petition.

23 93. Govt. Code §§ 6200-6203 make it illegal to, among other things, "alter or
24 falsify" any part of the public record for custodians of the record, those who altered the

95. Since May 26, 2020 and thereafter, the City presented altered Notices of
2 Exemption of both the Land Use amendments and EJ Element, containing new significant

3 information, new signatures, but with the old date, and presented to the public as allegedly

4 unchanged. The backdating of the Notices of Exemption while adding new information

5 was misleading and prejudicial to the public.
96. On June 30, 2020, the City incorporated by reference the "June 9, 2020"
7 staff reports for both the Land Use amendments and EJ Element and purported to have

8 attached it in its entirety and unchanged to the supplemental introductory staff reports for
9 both. The supplemental staff reports for the Land Use amendments and EJ Element did not
10 mention any changes to the June 9, 2020 staff report that was attached to it. However, the
APC Floor 11 June 9, 2020 staff report was heavily amended, supplemented with new information and

15 misleading and prejudicial to the public.

16 97. Both supplemental staff reports containing the altered June 9, 2020 staff

17 reports for both Land Use amendments and EJ Elements were verified by several City

18 officials.

19 98. The City's attempted disguising and/or concealing of the alterations of the
20 Notices of Exemption and staff reports amounted to falsification of public records, in

21 violation of Govt. Code §§ 6200-6203.

22 99. The City's alteration of the Notices of Exemption and staff reports also
23 violated CEQA's good faith disclosure mandates.

101. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of
Paragraphs 1 through 100, inclusive, of this petition.

7

8 102. CEQA requires an accurate, stable, and finite project description, to meet its
informational mandates. "An accurate project description is necessary for an intelligent

10 evaluation of the potential environmental effects of a proposed activity.' (Cit. omit.) A

THE SILVERSTEIN LAW FIRM, APC POSI-LOLLE 215 North Marengo Avenue, 3'° Floor 9 narrow view of a project could result in the fallacy of division, that is, overlooking its

16 disclosure of the scope, purposes, and effect of a consistently described project, with

20 103.

21 Where the agency provides an inconsistent description portraying the
Project as having "no increase" while at the same time allowing for substantial changes in
22 existing conditions, it fails "to adequately apprise all interested parties of the true scope

23 and magnitude of the Project," amounting to prejudicial abuse of discretion for "failure to
24 provide a stable and consistent project description." San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center v.
25 County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 657. "By giving such conflicting signals
26 to decisionmakers and the public about the nature and scope of the activity being proposed,

highest intensity to the industrial zoning, which precisely matched the intensity needed for

16 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that in
violation of CEQA, the City's description of the Land Use amendments was not accurate,
17 stable and finite given that the density and intensity designations adopted as part

18 of the

19 Land Use amendments and particularly the 1380% intensity designation for the industrial

activity.
