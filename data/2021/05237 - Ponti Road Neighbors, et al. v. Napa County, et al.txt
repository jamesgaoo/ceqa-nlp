Case No.

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the October 19, 2021 decision of Napa County and its
3 Board of Supervisors to approve a conditional use permit for the Scarlett Winery

4 ("Winery" or Project"). Proposed for construction on Ponti Road-a narrow tree-lined
5 road in a rural, agricultural area-the Scarlett Winery is not a typical winery project. As
6 recognized by members of the Napa County Planning Commission, the Winery presents
7 particular challenges due to its location along a substandard road in an area known for its
8 exceptionally peaceful and rural character. Members of the public, including Petitioners,

9 urged the County to deny the Project as out of character with the rural character of Ponti
10 Road. Because the Winery would cause significant noise, traffic, safety, and water supply
11 impacts, Petitioners also requested that the County prepare an environmental impact report
12 before allowing the Project to go forward.

13 2. Petitioners, however, did more than simply object to the Winery. They also
14 worked to find a compromise that addressed the interests of both the project applicant and
15 the neighboring community. Petitioners demonstrated that it was feasible to reduce or
16 avoid many of the Winery's impacts by relocating its entrance to the Silverado Trail--a
17 major road that serves many wineries in Napa County. Such an alternative would have
18 satisfied the project applicant's desire to build a winery, while at the same time, it would
19 have reduced the Winery's impacts to Ponti Road and an already overburdened Skellenger
20 Lane. Access from the Silverado Trail would also have reduced the Winery's noise
21 impacts on neighbors along Ponti Road. The County and the Board of Supervisors ignored
22 these appeals and approved the Winery based on a mitigated negative declaration and
23 initial study ("Mitigated Negative Declaration") that fails to acknowledge the unique
24 nature of the area where the Winery would be located and, as a result, fails to adequately
25 analyze or mitigate the Winery's significant impacts.
26 3. The County not only failed to analyze and mitigate the Winery's adverse
27 impacts, it also violated its obligation to accept and consider public comment on the
28 environmental impacts of the Winery. The County refused to accept expert testimony
2
Verified Petition For Writ Of Mandate
Case No.

1 regarding the Project's significant traffic impacts and it refused comments on a revised
2 mitigated negative declaration that was never circulated for public review. Even though
3 this evidence did not exist and could not have existed at the time Petitioner Montgomery
4 was required to file her appeal, the County claimed it should have been included in that
5 initial appeal letter. As a result, the County improperly insulated the Board of Supervisors
6 from its obligation to consider all evidence regarding the Winery's adverse impacts and to
7 provide Petitioner Montgomery with a fair hearing of her claims.

8 4. The County's approval of the Winery without adequate environmental
9 review and consideration of its impacts and mitigation measures violates the California
10 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") and Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. The
11 County's approval must be set aside.
12 PARTIES

13 5. Nancy Montgomery is a property owner and taxpayer in Napa County. Ms.
14 Montgomery participated in the administrative process leading to the approval of the
15 Project and appealed the decision of the Planning Commission to the Board of Supervisors.
16 6. Ponti Road Neighbors is an unincorporated association of citizens and
17 taxpayers living and owning property along Ponti Road. Ponti Road Neighbors, which was
18 formed after approval of the Project, is dedicated to preserving the rural character and
19 quality of life along Ponti Road. Nancy Montgomery is a member of Ponti Road
20 Neighbors.

21 7. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial
22 benefit on the public by protecting the public from the environmental and other harms
23 alleged herein and by ensuring that the County abides by the procedures required under
24 law in approving development projects like the one at issue here. Petitioners are
25 beneficially interested in this matter because it has a direct interest in ensuring that the
26 Respondents fulfill their duties to comply with CEQA and state law guaranteeing the right

27 to a fair hearing.

28 8. Respondent County of Napa is, and at all times herein mentioned was, a
3
Verified Petition For Writ Of Mandate
Case No.

1 political subdivision of the State of California. The County is the "lead agency" for the

2 purposes of Public Resources Code Section 21067, with principal responsibility for
3 conducting environmental review of proposed actions. The County has a duty comply with

4 CEQA and state law.

5 9. Respondent Napa County Board of Supervisors is, and at all times herein
6 mentioned was, the duly elected decision-making body of Respondent County. As the
7 decision-making body, the Board of Supervisors was charged with responsibilities under
8 CEQA for conducting a proper review of the proposed action's environmental impacts,
9 ensuring a fair hearing, and granting the various approvals necessary for the Project.
10 10. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents
11 fictitiously named DOES 1 through 10 and sues such respondents by fictitious names.
12 Petitioners are informed and believe, and on the basis of such information and belief,
13 allege the fictitiously named respondents are also responsible for the actions described in
14 this Petition. When the true identities and capacities of these respondents have been
15 determined, Petitioners will amend this petition, with leave of the court if necessary, to
16 insert such identities and capacities.
17 11. Real Party in Interest Sherratt Reicher, Alsace Company LTD is listed on the
18 County's notice of determination as the Project applicant. Petitioner is informed and
19 believes and on that basis alleges that Sherratt Reicher is the principal of Alsace Company.
20 12. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege that Real Party in
21 Interest Alsace Company LTD, is, and at all times herein mentioned was, the owner of the
22 property where the Event Center will be located and the applicant for approval of the
23 Event Center.

24 13. Petitioners are unaware of the true capacities of Real Parties in Interest Does
25 11 through 20, and sues such real parties in interest by fictitious names. Petitioners are
26 informed and believe, and based on such information and belief, allege that the fictitiously
27 named real parties in interest are directly and materially affected by the actions described
28 in this Petition. When the true identities and capacities of these real parties in interest have
4
Verified Petition For Writ Of Mandate
Case No.

1 been determined, Petitioners will amend this Petition, with leave of the court if necessary,
2 to insert such identities and capacities.

3 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4 14. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding
5 paragraphs in their entirety.

6 15. The Napa County Superior Court has initial jurisdiction of the matters
7 alleged herein pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Sections 526, 527, 1085, 1087, and
8 1094.5, and Public Resources Code Sections 21168 and 21168.5.

9 16. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of
10 California in and for the County of Napa pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 394.
11 Respondents' main offices are located in and the activities authorized by Respondents will
12 occur in Napa County.

13 17. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the
14 instant action and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the
15 extent possible and required by law. Petitioners, including members of Ponti Road
16 | Neighbors, submitted numerous objections to approval of the Winery and the County's
a 17 reliance on a Mitigated Negative Declaration.

18 18. Respondents have taken final agency actions with respect to adopting the
19 Mitigated Negative Declaration and approving the Winery. Respondents have a duty to
20 comply with applicable state laws, including but not limited to CEQA, prior to undertaking
21 the discretionary approvals at issue in this lawsuit. Petitioners possess no effective remedy
22 to challenge the approvals at issue in this action other than by means of this lawsuit.
23 19. On November 18, 2021, Petitioners complied with Public Resources Code
24 Section 21167.5 by emailing and mailing to Respondents a letter stating that Petitioners
25 planned to file Petition for Writ of Mandate seeking to invalidate Respondents' approval
26 of the Project. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is the true and correct copy of this letter.
27 20. On November 19, 2021, Petitioners complied with Public Resources Code
28 Section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure Section 388 by furnishing the Attorney

Verified-Petition For Writ Of Mandate
Case No.

General of the State of California with a copy of the Petition. Attached hereto as Exhibit B
2 is the true and correct copy of the letter transmitting this Petition to the Attorney General.

3 21. Pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21167.6(b)(2), Petitioners elect
4 to prepare the record of proceedings in this Action. Concurrently with this Petition,
5 Petitioners filed a notice of election to prepare the administrative record on November 19,
6 2021.

7 22. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of
8 ordinary law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents
0O to set aside their adoption of the Mitigated Negative Declaration and approval of the
10 Winery. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approvals will remain in effect in
11 violation of State law, and Petitioner and residents and property owners of Napa County
12 will be irreparably harmed. No money damages or legal remedy could adequately
13 compensate Petitioners and the residents and property owners of the County for that harm.
14

15 23. STATEMENT OF FACTS

Petitioners reallege and incorporate by feference the preceding paragraphs in
16 their entirety.

17 24. Ponti Road, a narrow, two-lane road extends north from Skellenger Lane and
18 runs parallel to the Silverado Trail. The neighborhood around Ponti Road is zoned
19 agricultural preserve and agricultural watershed and consists of vineyards and homes.
20 Neither wineries nor commercial uses are located on Ponti Road.

21 25. In November 2016, applicant Sherratt Reicher on behalf of Alsace Company
22 LTD submitted an incomplete application for development of a 30,000 gallon per year
23 winery at 1052 Ponti Road. The proposal included production facilities totaling over
24 18,000 square feet, an outdoor crush pad, a hospitality and administrative building, and
25 tours and tastings and marketing events. Although the Project site is almost 48 acres, the
26 winery production facilities and tasting and event center are located as far as possible from
27 the applicant's homeand therefore, closer to neighboring properties that would
28 experience noise from the Winery's construction and operation.

Verified Petition For Writ Of Mandate 6

Case No.

26. The applicant did not submit a complete application until July 23rd 2019.
2 Less than two months later, on September 11, 2019, the County issued a mitigated
3 negative declaration and initial study ("Mitigated Negative Declaration") for the Project.
4 The County provided only 20 days for public review of the Mitigated Negative
5 Declaration, the minimum amount allowed by law.

6 27. On October 1, 2019 and within the public comment period, Petitioner
7 Montgomery submitted comprehensive comments documenting the inadequacies in the
8 Mitigated Negative Declaration. The comments, which were supported by expert
9 testimony, demonstrated that the County had failed to adequately address many of the
10 Winery's impacts, including its safety impacts along Ponti Road and Skellenger Lane, its
11 direct and cumulative traffic impacts, its noise impacts, and its water supply impacts.
12 Petitioner Montgomery specifically requested that an environmental impact report be
13 prepared to address the Winery's significant impacts-many of which are exacerbated by
14 its location in a rural area served by a substandard road.
15 28. On October 2, 2019, the day after the public comment period on the
16 Mitigated Negative Declaration closed, the County Planning Commission held a public
17 hearing on the Project. Members of the public, including Petitioner Montgomery,
18 presented their concerns to the Commission: As many neighbors along Ponti Road noted,
19 the applicant had never met with them to discuss the Winery prior to submitting its
20 application and had made no attempt to address their concerns.

21 29. Members of the Planning Commission expressed concern regarding the
22 failure of the Project applicant to consult with neighbors and also noted that Ponti Road

23 might not be an appropriate access point for the Winery. For example, Commissioner Ann
24 Cottrell noted that staff had not presented any alternatives for the Commission to consider
25 given the challenges posed by access from Ponti Road. Commissioner Cottrell also cited
26 heavy traffic on Skellenger Lane and requested more information about alternative access
27 that could alleviate this impact. Commissioner Gallagher echoed concerns about the failure
28 to address traffic impacts on Skellenger Lane. Based on these concerns, the Planning
7
Verified Petition For Writ Of Mandate
Case No.

1 Commission voted to continue the hearing.

2 30. Following the Planning Commission hearing, Petitioner Montgomery
commissioned a study of the feasibility of providing access to the Project site from the
4 Silverado Trail. That study concluded that access from the Trail was feasible and would be
more appropriate than Ponti Road for the level of traffic associated with the Project. โข

6 31. In addition to demonstrating the feasibility of providing access from the
7 Silverado Trail, Petitioners also reiterated their concern about the inability of Ponti Road to
8 support the truck traffic and visitor and event traffic proposed by the Winery. As noted in
Petitioner Montgomery's comments, Ponti Road does not meet the County road standards,
10 which require that all roads "be constructed to provide a minimum of two 10-foot traffic
11 lanes and a minimum of one foot of shoulder on each side of the roadway providing two-
12 way traffic flow." Because Ponti Road is only 14 feet wide in many places, it does not
13 meet this criteria. The driveway for the Winery will actually be wider than Ponti Road-
14 the primary point of access to the Winery.
15 32. Petitioner Montgomery also pointed out that because the Ponti Road public
16 right of way only extends to the pavement, the Road cannot be widened to meet County
17 Road standards. The Road's narrow width also means that 2 vehicles cannot safely pass
18 without pulling over onto the private property that borders the Road. As a result, approval
19 of the Winery necessarily means that the private property adjoining Ponti Road will be
20 used by vehicles visiting the Winery. Although the County staff report recommended the
21 adoption of "pull outs" to accommodate passing vehicles, it did not study whether those
22 pull outs would be effective. The County also failed to study the environmental impacts of
23 the pull outs, including the removal of mature walnut trees.
24 33. The Planning Commission heard the application on January 15, 2020. At that
25 hearing, members of the public including Petitioners, objected that the County had not
26 adequately reviewed the impacts of the Winery and urged the Commission to require
27 access come from the Silverado Trail. Petitioners also pointed out that the County had
28 failed to conduct any study of noise impacts from the Winery.
8
Verified Petition For Writ Of Mandate
Case No.

34. Commissioner Cottrell again expressed concern about the impacts of the
2 Winery traffic and recommended that the Silverado Trail be considered as the access for
3 the Project. Ultimately, the Commission approved the Winery on a 4-1 vote, with
4 Commissioner Cottrell voting no.

35. Petitioner Montgomery filed an appeal of the Planning Commission's
6 decision on February 12, 2020. Petitioner's appeal raised all of the issues previously
7 addressed by Petitioner in the comments on the mitigated negative declaration and at the
8 hearings on the Project. Petitioner also submitted an expert analysis critiquing the staff
9 report's discussion of noise from the Winery. In particular, the analysis showed that even
10 under the County's own standards the Project would result in significant noise impacts.
11 Petitioner Montgomery also requested that the Board of Supervisors hold a de novo
12 hearing on the appeal.

13 36. On July 8, 2020, the Chair of the Board of Supervisors found that good cause
14 existing to include Petitioner's noise analysis in the record but denied the request that the
15 Board hear the matter de novo.

16 37. Following that decision, the County took the appeal off calendar and notified
17 the parties it would prepare a noise analysis for the Project.

18 38. The County's noise report was not completed until March, 2021. Although

19 no noise study had previously been prepared for the Winery, the County did not release the
20 noise report for public review. Instead, it only provided Petitioner Montgomery with the
21 opportunity to submit comments on the noise report. The County also informed Petitioner
22 Montgomery that any comments must be limited to 10 pages.

23 39. During the time that the County continued to review the environmental
24 impacts of the Winery, other winery projects in the vicinity of the Winery were under
25 review by the County. In January 2021, the County was notified that the Meyer Family
26 Vineyards intended to open a winery and tasting room (the "Bonny Winery") on
27 Skellenger Lane, just yards from Ponti Road. The Bonny Winery would have 6 full time
28 employees and would host 45 visitors per day for tours and tastings, 2 large events per year
9
Verified Petition For Writ Of Mandate
Case No.

with up to 150 attendees, and 9 events per year with up to 80 attendees. The proposed
2 winery would include 23 parking spaces and would be accessed via a driveway from
3 Skellenger Lane.

4 40. On May 19, 2021, the Planning Commission approved the Benjamin Winery,
5 which would be located at 8895 Conn Creek Road, a short distance north a of the proposed
6 Scarlett Winery. This Benjamin Winery would produce up to 475,000 gallons of wine per
7 year and would have 61 employees.

8 41. On June 18, 2021-the deadline established by the County to submit

9 additional comments on the appeal-Petitioner Montgomery submitted comments on the
10 noise report and on the cumulative traffic impacts that would occur from the Winery in
11 combination with the Benjamin and Bonny Wineries. Petitioner's expert analysis
12 demonstrated that the County noise report overstated existing ambient noise levels and
13 therefore understated noise impacts from the Winery. The expert analysis also
14 demonstrated that the noise report failed to address noise from key elements of the project,
15 including production facilities. Petitioner Montgomery also requested that the County's
16 noise report be circulated for public review so that members of the public could be
17 informed about and comment on the noise impacts of the Winery. However, the County
18 did not release the noise study for public comment, but limited the ability to comment on
19 the noise study to Petitioner Montgomery.

20 42. Petitioner's comments also included an expert traffic analysis demonstrating
21 that the Benjamin and Bonny Wineries would exacerbate the traffic impacts of the Project
22 and on Skellenger Lane and contribute to potentially hazardous conditions on the narrow
23 road. Because the County had previously established a 10-page limit on comments,
24 Petitioner's comments, including expert reports, were limited to 10 pages. However,
25 because Petitioner objected to the 10-page limit as inconsistent with CEQA, Petitioner also
26 submitted a longer comment letter that included more detail about the impacts of the
27 Winery and the County's failure to comply with CEQA.
28 43. On July 13, 2021, the County issued a decision rejecting Petitioner
10
Verified Petition For Writ Of Mandate
Case No.

Montgomery's comments on the cumulative traffic impacts of the Winery. The County

2 asserted that because the comments were not submitted with Petitioner's appeal letter, they
were untimely and would not be included in the administrative record on the Project.

4 However, at the time the appeal was filed, the County had not even released the
environmental review for the Benjamin Winery and it had not received notice of the Bonny
6 Winery. Therefore, these issues could not have been raised at the time of the appeal.

7 44. On July 30, 2021, Petitioner Montgomery objected to the County's failure to
8 I include comments on the Winery's cumulative traffic impacts in the record and reiterated
9 her position that the County was required to consider the additional evidence of the
10 Winery's cumulative impacts.
11 45. On August 11, 2021, the County released its staff report for the August 25,
12 2021 Board of Supervisors meeting where it would hear Petitioner Montgomery's appeal.
13 That staff report made clear for the first time that the County had revised the mitigated
14 negative declaration for the Winery. New information in the revised mitigated negative
15 declaration addressed both the Winery's noise and water supply impacts. The revised
16 mitigated negative declaration was not circulated for public review and had not been made
17 publicly available prior to the issuance of the staff report.
18 46. On August 19, 2021, the deadline established by the County for submission
19 of any presentation to the Board of Supervisors at its August 25 hearing, Petitioner
20 Montgomery submitted a PowerPoint presentation for the hearing. Petitioner Montgomery
21 also submitted a letter detailing inadequacies in the revised mitigated negative declaration
22 and identifying new information demonstrating that the County's environmental review

23 was not adequate. For example, Petitioner Montgomery submitted evidence showing that
24 the increasing drought conditions undermined the County's conclusion that sufficient
25 water existed to supply the Project. Petitioner Montgomery also objected that conditions
26 added to the revised mitigated declaration related to water supply were legally inadequate
27 and would not address the Winery's impacts. Petitioner Montgomery also objected that the
28 County's failure to accept evidence of the Winery's impacts on cumulative traffic impacts
11
Verified Petition For Writ Of Mandate
Case No.

and other issues violated CEQA and her right to a fair hearing under Code of Civil
2 Procedure section 1094.5.

47. On August 20, 2021, the Chair of the Board of Supervisors determined that

4 Petitioner's August 19 letter would be excluded from the administrative record and would
5 not be considered by the Board of Supervisors in its consideration of the Winery or the
6 appeal.

7 48. On August 25, 2021, the Board of Supervisors held its hearing on Petitioner
8 Montgomery's appeal. At that hearing Petitioner Montgomery objected to the County's
rejection of evidence supporting the appeal and requested the Board overturn the Chair's
10 ruling that such evidence be excluded from the administrative record and not considered
11 by the Board. The Board voted to uphold the Chair's determination.

12 49. Petitioner Montgomery and other members of the public also objected to the
13 Winery and urged the Board to balance the interests of the entire neighborhood to ensure
14 that Winery's impacts would be addressed before it was approved. Petitioner and members
15 of the public requested that the Project be modified so that it would be accessed from the
16 Silverado Trail. And, in the absence of changes necessary to address its environmental
17 impacts, Petitioner Montgomery and others urged the Board to require preparation of an
18 environmental impact report. Supervisor Diane Dillon agreed that the Silverado Trail
19 should serve as the access point for the Winery and voted to deny the Winery unless such a
20 change was made. Ultimately, however, the Board ignored the comments of the public and
21 Petitioners and voted 4-1 to approve the Winery.
22 50. The County filed its Notice of Determination with the County Clerk on
23 October 22, 2021.

24 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION Violation of CEQA 25 (Public Resources Code ยง 21000 et. seq.)
26 51. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs in
27 their entirety.

28 52. CEQA is designed to ensure that government agencies incorporate the goal
12
Verified Petition For Writ Of Mandate
Case No.

of long-term protection of the environment in decisions regarding government actions that
2 may affect the environment. CEQA applies to any discretionary action taken by an agency
3 that may cause a reasonably foreseeable change in the environment.

4 53. CEQA requires preparation of an environmental impact report whenever
5 substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that a project may have a
6 significant effect on the environment.

7 54. The County violated CEQA by failing to prepare an EIR because substantial
8 evidence in the record supports a fair argument the Winery may have. the following
9 significant impacts;

10 a. safety impacts due to increased traffic along Ponti Road and

11 Skellenger Road which threatens the safety of pedestrians and

12 bicyclists in addition to other drivers;

13 b. disruption of the rural character of Ponti Road due to increased traffic

14 and noise;

15 C. noise impacts from operation of the Winery, including production
16 noise from equipment and noise from events such as wine tastings .

17 d. impacts on water supply;

18 e. cumulative impacts from the Winery and multiple winery projects

19 approved in the County without adequate environmental review.

20 55. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency adopt feasible and enforceable
21 mitigation measures that would reduce or avoid any of the project's significant
22 environmental impacts. If substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that
23 any of the project's significant impacts cannot be mitigated to a less than significant level,
negative declaration but must instead prepare an EIR. 24  an agency may not rely on a
25 56. The County failed to adopt adequate mitigation measures to address the
26 potentially significant safety, traffic, noise, and water supply impacts from the Winery. For
27 example,

28 a. The County failed to address safety impacts caused by increased truck
13
Verified Petition For Writ Of Mandate
Case No.

1 and vehicle traffic along Ponti Road. Although the narrow road fails to
2 meet County standards for roadways, the County required only that the
3 Applicant provide 2 pullouts that do not remedy the substandard nature of
4 Ponti Road for commercial access and that will prevent conflicts between

5 vehicles and other users of the roadway, including pedestrians and

6 bicyclists.

7 b. The County failed to require access to the Project from the Silverado

8 Trail even though such access would avoid significant safety and traffic
9 impacts to both Ponti Road and Skellenger Lane.
10 C. The County improperly deferred its analysis and mitigation of potentially
11 significant water impacts by failing to analyze. water supply impacts and
12 delaying the formulation of mitigation until after the Project begins
13 operation.
14 d. The County improperly deferred analysis of pull outs along Ponti Road,
15 including an assessment of their effectiveness and their environmental
16 impacts.

17 57. The County further violated CEQA by relying on an inadequate negative
18 declaration that failed to fully assess the potential impacts of the project, regardless of
19 whether they required preparation of an EIR. Inadequacies include, but are not limited to,
20 the inadequate or non-existent analysis of traffic, safety, noise, and water supply impacts
21 from the Winery. For example, the Mitigated Negative Declaration relied on an improper
22 baseline for assessing noise impacts from the Winery and, because it relied on an approach
23 that overstated existing noise levels, the Mitigated Negative Declaration understated the
24 actual noise impacts of the Project.
25 58. The County further violated CEQA by refusing to accept or consider
26 evidence of the Project's significant environmental impacts that was not included in the
27 February 12, 2020 appeal letter. For example, the County refused to consider evidence
28 submitted regarding the cumulative impacts of the Winery in combination with other
14
Verified Petition For Writ Of Mandate
Case No.

recently approved winery projects in Napa. The County also refused to accept comments
2 on the revised mitigated negative declaration even though it was revised after the Planning
3 Commission approved the Project and before the Board of Supervisors heard Nancy
4 Montgomery's appeal.

5 59. The County further violated CEQA by failing to circulate the revised noise
6 study and revised mitigated negative declaration for public review even though both
7 documents contained significant new information about the Project and should have been
8 subject to public review and comment.

9 60. For all the above reasons, Respondents have abused their discretion and
10 failed to comply with the law.

11 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

12 Violation of Code of Civil Procedure ยง 1094.5

13 61. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs in
14 their entirety.

15 62. Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 requires a "fair trial" in
16 administrative proceedings where "a hearing is required to be given, evidence is required
17 to be taken, and discretion in the determination of facts is vested in the inferior tribunal,
18| corporation, board, or officer." CCP ยง 1094.5(a)-(b). Issuance of a conditional use permit
19 is subject to review under CCP section 1094.5.
20 63. The County violated the requirements of CCP section 1094.5 when it refused
21 to accept or consider evidence demonstrating the Project would adversely impact
22 neighboring property owners, including Nancy Montgomery. Moreover, by deliberately
23 excluding evidence directly related to the issues raised by the Montgomery appeal, the
24 County deprived Nancy Montgomery of a fair hearing on her claim.
25 64. For all the above reasons, Respondents have abused their discretion and
26 failed to comply with the law.

27 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

28 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:

Re: Notice of Commencement of CEQA Litigation Challenging Approval of Conditional Use Permit P16-00428-UP and Adoption of A Mitigated Negative Declaration

Dear Ms. Hoskins:

This letter is to notify you that Ponti Road Neighbors and Nancy Montgomery will file suit against Napa County and its Board of Supervisors for failure to observe the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq., the CEQA Guidelines, California Code of Regulations section 15000 et seq., and state law in connection with the approval of conditional use permit P16-00428-UP and adoption of a mitigated negative declaration in
connection therewith. This notice is given pursuant to Public Resources Code section
21167.5.

Please note that, pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6, the
record of proceedings for the County's actions includes, among other items, all "internal
agency communications, including staff notes and memoranda related to the project or to
compliance with [CEQA]." Because all e-mails and other internal communications
related to the conditional use permit and negative declaration are part of the
administrative record for the lawsuit to be filed by petitioners, the County may not destroy or delete such documents prior to preparation of the record in this case.
Very truly yours,
SHUTE, MIHALY & WEINBERGER LLP
