19 Respondents.

21

22 1. This case seeks to protect 110 year-old California pepper trees that were planted

23 in conjunction with the original Kensington Park subdivision of the City of San Diego in

24 approximately 1910. Such trees are an important part of the community, helping to create the

25 historic ambience of Kensington, providing substantial cooling and shading, and aiding the

26 sequestration of greenhouse gases.
2.
27 Because of the age of the California pepper trees, such trees are entitled to extra-
protection as "heritage trees" under Council Policy CP900-19. Nevertheless, the City Forester, 28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS: COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
1

BRIAN WIDENER, has unilaterally rejected protected status of such trees, and has ordered the

2 removal of multiple California pepper trees.

3 3. EMERGENCY TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER and INJUNCTIVE

4 RELIEF is required to prevent any further loss of the 110 year old pepper trees without following

5 the procedures outlined in Council Policy CP900-19. Three 110 year-old pepper trees located at
4748, 4758 and 4772 Marlborough, in Kensington, will be cut down by Friday, February 5, 2021,
6 if the court fails to prohibit such actions.
7 4. All other 110 year-old pepper trees in Kensington are in danger. Evidence
8 demonstrates that the CITY OF SAN DIEGO has evaluated almost 60 pepper trees throughout

9 San Diego in the last five years, yet the City is only targeting pepper trees in Kensington,

10 5. A writ should be issued requiring the City Forester to designate the 110 year-old

11 pepper trees as protected trees, and forward the Conserve-a-Tree nomination to the Community

12 Forest Advisory Board for their input.

13

14 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

6.
15 Petitioner brings this matter under Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1060, 1085, and
other relevant statutes.
16 7. Venue is proper in the Central District of the San Diego Superior Court because
17 the actions, duties and obligations arise within the City of San Diego.

21. Petitioner will be irreparably harmed by the activities complained upon herein, in

2 that the loss of trees will permanently damage her and the neighborhood in a manner that cannot

3 be compensated by monetary damages, and where the loss of the 110 year-old trees will make

4 any future relief ineffectual.

22.

16
C. Such fees will not be paid out of any recovery.
17 24. The action of respondents herein complained of were arbitrary and capricious and
18 petitioner is entitled to recover attorney's fees pursuant to Government Code § 800.

20 BACKGROUND

21 25. Kensington is one of the early subdivisions of San Diego, having been created in

22 1910. It is described in the City's Mid-City Community Plan, "Named for borough in London

23 England, Kensington is a pioneering subdivision dating to 1910. With its stone gateways,

24 ornamental lighting, and curving street, the neighborhood is a strong candidate for designation as
a historic district.3
25
26. According to photographs in historic promotional materials, Schinus Molle, also
26 known as California pepper trees, were planted along the streets in what was then known as the
27 Kensington Park subdivision. According to the City's Historical Greater Mid-City San Diego
28 Preservation Strategy survey conducted in 1996, the historic and architectural significance of the

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
. 4 -

Kensington Park subdivision was described thusly, "The development boasted the most

2 improvements of any other subdivision in San Diego, they included; grading, sidewalks, water,

3 gas, lighting, pepper trees were planted along the streets and a small park."

4 27. On or about August 23, 2018, Jeanie Camp, with the assistance of Margaret

5 McCann, submitted an application under the City of San Diego's "Conserve-A-Tree Program"
for designation of the 33 remaining California pepper trees for protected status, via U.S. Mail. 6 The application was accompanied by maps showing the locations of the current pepper trees and
7 photographs showing the historical evidence that the pepper trees were planted in 1910 or shortly
8 thereafter.

9 28. On or about January 17, 2019, Maggie McCann resubmitted the application under
10 her own name via email. The application was emailed directly to Respondent Brian Widener, as

11 well as staff for Council President Gomez.

12 29. On July 30, 2019, Petitioner CECELIA (aka Celia) CONOVER, sent a letter to

13 Council President Georgette Gomez identifying the trees as heritage trees and requesting that the

14 City declare a city-wide moratorium on removal of the mature trees until personnel from the

15 City's Urban Forestry division and a Community Forest Advisory Board arborist performed an
onsite inspection of any of the trees marked for removal.
16 30. On August 7, 2019, a representative from Georgette Gomez's office sent a
17 response to Petitioner allegedly containing a statement from the City Forester. Of note, the
18 statements from Brian Widener indicated that the tree in front of Petitioner Maggie McCann's
19 house at 4650 Edgeware was sound and stable, but that "although this tree does fit most of the
20 criteria of a Heritage Tree, the City does not normally place pepper trees under protected tree

21 status." The statement alleged that the City Forester "confirmed that the other 35 pepper trees

22 identified as potential parkway trees do not meet the criteria or condition for that designation."

23 The statement concluded "Given Mr. Widener's finding, the Transportation and Storm Water

24 Department cannot approve Ms. Camp's application."
31.
25 On January 13, 2020, a subcontractor for the City of San Diego cut down a large
and stable 110-year old pepper tree at 4539 Edgeware Road, in Kensington. The sidewalk had 26 already been repaired during the previous year and had been designed with a cut-out to prevent
27 any damage to the pepper tree's roots.

,5 -

1 32. On November 13, a 2020, a 110 year-old pepper tree was removed by the City at

2 4715 Edgeware in Kensington. Petitioner alleges on information and belief that such tree may

3 have been unstable and a potential hazard

4 33. On January 13, 2020, a 110 year-old pepper tree was removed by the City at 4160

5 Monroe Avenue. Petitioner alleges on information and belief that the homeowner and Council
President objected to such removal, as did Petitioner.
6 34. Petitioner alleges on information and belief that in the last four years, the City
7 evaluated approximately 58 pepper trees outside of Kensington, and removed only four, two of
8 which were completely dead. In Kensington, the City has removed three pepper trees in the last
9 year and is contemplated the immediately removal of three more. Petitioner alleges that only one
10 such tree was a potential safety hazard.

11 35. Petitioner alleges that the 110 year old pepper trees located at 4748, 4756, and

12 4772 Marlborough are scheduled for removal on Friday, February 5, 2020. Petitioner further

13 alleges that such trees are currently stable. In particular, such trees survived a January 25, 2021

14 windstorm in Kensington without losing limb. Petitioner further alleges on information and

15 belief that the windstorm on January 25, 2021, blew over 5 palm trees blew causing significant
damage.
16 36. Petitioner alleges on information and belief that the pepper trees located at 4748,
17 4756, and 4772 Marlborough will be removed on Friday, February 5, 2021, if the court does not
18 immediately act and issue a TRO to prohibit the cutting down of the 110 year-old pepper trees in
19 Kensington.
20 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (WRIT OF MANDAMUS)

22 37. Petitioner re-alleges all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

23 38. Petitioner alleges on information and belief that the City Forester, or its

24 subcontractors failed to get a tree removal permit from the City of San Diego's Parks and

25 Recreation Director, as required by San Diego Municipal Code section 62.0604, prior to
removing the tree at 4539 Edgeware, and the threatened removal of other 110 year-old trees in
26 Kensington. Alternatively, if such tree removal permit was issued, it was issued without
27 following the procedures outlined in City Council Policy CP900-19.
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
6 -

39. Petitioner alleges on information and belief, that Respondent Brian Widener failed

2 to follow the procedures outlined in City Council Policy CP900-19, by not considering or

3 seeking the input of community members, the Kensington Talmadge Planning Group, and the

4 City Forestry Advisory Board, prior to causing the removal of the tree at 4539 Edgeware road,

5 and the removal of other 110 year-old trees.
40.
6 Respondent Brian Widener has exceeded his authority by adopting an unwritten
policy of refusing to designate California Pepper Trees, or other Pepper Trees, as protected trees,
7 contrary to CP900-19.
8 41. Respondent Brian Widener has exceeded his authority by adopting an unwritten
9 policy of allowing only individuals adjacent to the street trees to seek protected status for the
10 trees, and refusing to consider an application that seeks "heritage tree" status for 33 heritage
11 trees.

12 42. Petitioner alleges, on information and belief, that Respondent Brian Widener has

13 violated his duties under the law, and that the City of San Diego has endorsed, accepted and/or

14 encouraged such violations, contrary to policies that mandate an increase in canopy cover and the

15 planting of more trees.

43.
16 Petitioner is entitled to a writ of mandamus, ordering the City Forester to consider
designating the approximately thirty remaining 110 year-old pepper trees in Kensington for
17 protected tree status.
18 44. Petitioner is entitled to a writ of mandamus ordering the City and the City
19 Forester, upon notice, to designate any tree that is over 50 years old as a heritage tree, and
20 forward such recommendation to the Community Forest Advisory Board.

21

22 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (DECLARATORY RELIEF AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF)

24 45. Petitioner re-alleges all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.
46.
25 Petitioner has a current beneficial interest in protecting the 110 year-old pepper

26 trees from being chopped down in Kensington, and for the City Forester to follow the law and
Council Policy CP900-19.
27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
- 7-

1 47. Petitioner alleges that the City Forester cannot unilaterally deny protected tree

2 status without considering comments from residents of Kensington, from the Kensington

3 Talmadge Planning Group and comments from the Community Forest Advisory Board.

4 48. Petitioner alleges that the City Forester cannot implement an unwritten rule that

5 denies protected tree status to California pepper trees regardless of the pepper trees' age and
historical significance.
6 49. Petitioner alleges that the City Forester broke the law and violated City Council
7 Policy CP900-19 by cutting down the 110 year old pepper tree in front of 4539 Edgeware Road,
8 in San Diego.
9 50. Upon information and belief, the City of San Diego and City Forester Brian

10 Widener disputes such facts.

11 51. Whereas, a judicial declaration of this issue is necessary to avoid a multiplicity of

12 lawsuits as the City and City Forester attempts or succeeds in cutting down the 110 year-old

13 pepper trees in Kensington.

14 52. Petitioners is entitled to injunctive relief, preventing the further removal of 110

15 year-old California Pepper Trees, in that monetary damages are not available and would not
adequately compensate petitioner for the loss caused by the removal of the trees.
16

17 PRAYER FOR RELIEF
18 WHEREFORE Petitioner prays for the following relief
