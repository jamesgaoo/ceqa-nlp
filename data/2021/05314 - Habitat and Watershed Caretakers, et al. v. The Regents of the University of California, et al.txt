VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 1 -

INTRODUCTION

2 1. This is a public interest citizen suit to assure that the Regents of the University of
3 California (the "University") complies with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"),
4 Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq., before deciding whether to develop a massive student a
5 housing project at the University of California at Santa Cruz ("UCSC"), including development of the
6 pristine and long-protected East Meadow. Petitioners and plaintiffs Habitat and Watershed Caretakers,
7 Don Stevens, Russell B. Weisz, Hal Levin, Harry D. Huskey and Peter L. Scott (collectively,
8 "Petitioners") seek full environmental disclosure, appropriately timed, placed and priced campus
9 development, adherence to the University's core commitment to public service, and protection of
10 irreplaceable, world-class vistas, vulnerable endangered species and scarce and overtapped water
11 supplies. Petitioners challenge the University's unlawful action in approving the Student Housing
12 /West Project ("SHW" or "Project"), adopting the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program
13 ("MMRP"), CEQA Findings, and Statement of Overriding Considerations thereto, approving the
14 Project's design, and issuing the March 18, 2021 Notice of Determination ("NOD") (collectively,

15 * Approvals") for the Project. These Approvals authorized construction-of a poorly sited, excessively
16 sized and overpriced housing project at two sites on the UCSC campus that will degrade extraordinary
17 scenic resources, impair scarce water supplies, impact wildlife habitat, waste public resources, and
18 needlessly sacrifice the iconic beauty of the deeply venerated and the long-protected East Meadow, in
19 Iviolation of CEQA.

20 2. In furtherance of these same goals, petitioners also request this Court's interpretation of
21 two key provisions of the parties' 2008 Comprehensive Settlement Agreement ("CSA") that define the
22 permissible scope and rate of growth of UCSC. Petitioners seek to assure that the University complies
23 with the Judgment of this Court, per the Honorable Paul P. Burdick, entered September 22, 2008
24 approving and requiring the parties' compliance with the CSA that resolved litigation arising out of - and
25 overturning - the University's approval of its 2005 Long Range Development Plan ("LRDP") for UCSC.
26 (Don Stevens, et al. v. University of California Santa Cruz, et al., Civ. Nos. CV 155583, et al., Judgment
27 filed September 22, 2008, at Exhibit A thereto.) The Judgment specifically retains this Court's
28 jurisdiction over the signatories to the CSA "during the duration of the [CSA] … for purposes of

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 2 -

resolving disputes that may arise in connection with the interpretation or implementation of the [CSA]."
2 (Judgment at 3:2-5.)

3 3. The impacts of the SHW Project demonstrably exceed the University's disclosure,
4 evaluation and mitigation of them. The Project will irreparably harm visual resources, commit the City
5 of Santa Cruz Water Department ("SCWD") to provide water it does not have, and undermine UCSC's
6 public service goals in favor of private development interests. Although the Project literally paves the
7 way for future expansion onto and degradation of the pristine East Meadow, that growth-inducing impact
8 is ignored. The Project's addition of 3,000 beds also prematurely commits the University to rapid-

9 growth, high-density scenario which would increase the student population by about 50 percent from the
10  roughly 19,000 students accommodated today to 28,000 students by 2040 - before the public and the
11 decisionmakers have reviewed, let alone approved, this future expansion.

12 4. The entirety of this Project will be planned, constructed and operated "via a public-private
13 |partnership (P3) delivery method" ("PPP"), which poses profound conflicts with the public's control over
14 the scale, pace and nature of campus development. September 2018 Revised Draft Environmental Impact
15 Report ("RDEIR") 3.0-1; February 2019 Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") 2.0-2. The
16 University is public education and research institution that is "driven by values of public service." The
17 UCSC campus likewise prides itself on its "uncommon commitment to .. . public service.32 Yet, this
18 Project will interpose private, profit-driven management biases into the decisionmaking process for future
19 campus development. Under the PPP model, the SHW Project's two sites will be ground leased to
20 Collegiate Housing Foundation ("CHF*), a non-profit limited liability corporation, or its affiliated
21 designee, and developed by Capstone Development Partners ("Capstone" or "CDP") under contracts with
22 CHF and the University which have not been made available to the public. Capstone will make a profit
23 proportional to the scale of the new development, and thus Capstone has an incentive to push for a large-

T scale development.

2 5. The UCSC SHW website "Project Structure" page shows "Significant Risk Transfer" from
3 the University to the Collegiate Housing Foundation, but does not explain what that risk is. However, it
4 may be inferred that the risk is whether there will be sufficient demand for the student housing to pay

5 debt service. CHF will not assume the "risk transfer," nor will private bond holders, without financial

6 security assurances from the University, especially considering that SHW is by far the largest housing
7 |project in UCSC's history with a correspondingly higher degree of risk. Since UCSC states that it will be
8 "utilizing only rent revenue collected by UC Santa Cruz from student residents to fund project operations
9 and pay debt service," then it appears UCSC will be obligated and financially compelled to increase
10 enrollment in violation of the undergraduate student enrollment cap mandated by the Comprehensive
11 Settlement Agreement between the University, UCSC and Petitioners, should there be insufficient
12 demand. Undergraduate monthly rent revenue is projected to be approximately $4,235,650 and account
13 for 89% of the total SHW Project income if fully occupied. (AECOM, Supplementary Campus Report
14 Appendix 5, March 2019, p. 1.) The risk associated with the SHW Project is illustrated by the fact that a
15 50% vacancy rate would lead to an unsustainable $2,100,000 monthly income deficit. Indeed, UCSC
16 Istates on the SHW website that "keeping housing costs affordable to students is essential to longterm
17 success of the project." Id. (emphasis added).

18 6. Whether there will be sufficient demand is therefore of critical importance and largely
19 dependent on whether the SHW Project is more affordable than the off-campus housing market.
20 However, there is irrefutable evidence that the SHW Project's housing rates are, on average, almost
21 double the comparable rates of the off-campus market. This fact reveals that the University's stated
22 project objective of providing affordable housing is unattainable, and invalidates the University's demand
23 projections based on the false premise that SHW units will be more affordable than off-campus units.

24 7. The SHW Project's high housing rental rates also refute the University's statement that
25 this project will reduce housing demand in the community. Once complete, approximately 2,000
26 |existing students will no longer be seeking housing in the greater region." In fact, because the SHW units
27 will not be affordable, it is highly unlikely that many of these 2,000 students will be willing and able to
28 pay almost twice as much to live in SHW high-rise units. Therefore, it is highly likely that substantial

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 4 -

lenrollment growth will be required in order to achieve sufficient occupancy to service the debt, and that
2 the Project risk has been substantially understated.

3 8. Capstone will develop cost estimates for the Project and project alternatives, design and

4 build the buildings and set rent and fees in collaboration with UCSC, and in conjunction with its non-
lprofit affiliate -- Collegiate Housing Foundation ("CHF") - arrange for project financing. However,
6 UCSC has not made details of the partnership agreement available to the public, unlike UC Merced,
which has published its PPP agreements online. (Project Funding -- Merced 2020 - UC Mereed
https://merced2020.ucmerced.edu/financialstructure.)UCSC's failure to make this information available
9 to the public keeps the public and petitioners in the dark regarding the financial aspect of the SHW
10 Project. This privatization of campus development undermines the University's public service-driven
11 policies by injecting private, profit-driven priorities and prejudices into the planning process without
12 disclosure of them to the public and petitioners.

13 9. Information on "Project Structure" from the SHW website
14 http://ucscstudenthlusingwest.org/project-structure)shows significant risk transfer to CHF, while by
15 comparison, a university-financed project has minimal risk transfer. UCSC has failed to explain what
16 additional risk CHF is assuming, how that risk is accounted for, and whether or not as part of its
17 arrangement with CDP and CHF the University has pledged to ensure sufficient enrollment growth,
18 regardless of the enrollment cap imposed by its Comprehensive Settlement Agreement ("CSA") with
19 petitioners, to ensure high occupancy rate.

20 10. The University admits that these private, profit-driven goals conflict with the University's
21 public objectives. It states that "the use of a PPP is most effective for projects that . .. [a]re situated off-
22 campus on land not owned by [the Universityl" because projects on University owned land often
23 constrain contracting options available to private sector developers" and limit their ability to make a
24 profit.' This discordant competition between divergent public and private decision-making paradigms
25 raises the question whose goals will prevail in the planning process - the University's public-service

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 5 -

1 lobjectives, or the developer's private profit-driven bottomline.

2 11. The Project will have significant and unavoidable impacts on natural resources, including
3 the visual resources of the East Meadow. The extraordinary and iconic beauty of the East Meadow will
4 be permanently degraded. RDEIR 4.1-55 to 4.1-63; FEIR 4.0-8 to 4.0-11. The Project will exacerbate
5 the existing water supply shortfall that has been repeatedly documented by the SCWD. The University
6 ladmits that "there would be a substantial gap between supply and demand during multiple dry years."
7 RDEIR.4.13-21; FEIR 3.0-210. Habitat important to imperiled species, including burrowing owls and
8 California red-legged frogs, would be harmed.

9 12. In an attempt to justify opening the East Meadow and the rest of the campus to current and
10 future unnecessary development, the University exaggerated the costs and impacts of alternatives as
11 compared to the costs and impacts of the Project. Its apples-to-oranges cost analysis ignored both the
12 short- and the long-term costs associated with creating new development. The University's attempt to
13 downplay both the cost and impact of constructing housing violates CEQA.

14 13. On October 30, 2020, the Santa Cruz Superior Court "issued a writ a of mandate directing
15 the Regents to set aside the Project design approval, the CEQA Findings and Statement of Overriding
16 Considerations, and the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program." (Board of Regents of the
17 University of California, Finance and Capital Strategies Committee, March 17-18, 2021 Agenda Item F5
18 |Staff Report, p. 2; East Meadow Action Committee v. Regents, Case No. 19CV01312, Judgment issued
19 |October 30, 2020.) But the Project's significant impacts remain profound and inadequately analyzed, and
20 the Regents' Findings still fail to bridge the analytical gap between those impacts and the decision to
21 proceed with the Project. (Topanga Association for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles (1974)
22 11 Cal.3d 506, 515.)

23 14. As the University admits, the Project's impacts "will [still] be significant and
24 unavoidable .. . in the area of aesthetics, scenic vistas, scenic resources, and visual character and
25 quality." (Board of Regents of the University of California, March 17-18, 2021 Agenda Item F5 Staff
26 Report, p. 15.) Furthermore, "campus growth under the 2005 LRDP will result in significant and
27 unavoidable water supply impacts and equire the development of additional housing that will result in
28 significant and unavoidable cumulative impacts related to traffic and water supply." (Id.) But without

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 6 -

1 additional mitigation or explanation of how these impacts will be prevented, the draft Findings and
2 Statement of Overriding Considerations' conclusion that the Project should continue violates CEQA.

3 15. The Approvals likewise violate the terms of the CSA. The Project enables and commits
4 the University to increase enrollment beyond the 17,500 undergraduate student enrollment cap in order to

5 ensure a high SHW Project occupancy rate. The Approvals allow, enable and exert substantial financial
6 pressure on the University to increase enrollment at UCSC beyond the cap imposed by the CSA in order
7 to ensure a high SHW Project occupancy rate for the financial benefit of CDP. The CSA affirmatively
8 commits the University to restrict undergraduate enrollment to 17,500 full-time-equivalent (*FTE")
9 students (averaged over the fall-winter-spring quarters) "[fJor as long as the 2005 LRDP is in effect."
§ 10 (CSA § 1.1.) The CSA also provides that "UCSC agrees that the next major amendment to the 2005
11 LRDP will include a comprehensive analysis of potentially feasible alternative locations to accommodate
12 proposed UCSC enrollment growth beyond that analyzed in the 2005 LRDP EIR (i.e., satellite campuses,
13 remote-classrooms, etc.) as a means of assessing UCSC's ability to meet the State Mandate for Higher
14 Education while taking into consideration City of Santa Cruz infrastructure including, but not limited to,
15 transportation, water and housing." (CSA § 5.1.)

16 16. Petitioners Don Stevens, Russell B. Weisz, Hal Levin, Harry D. Huskey and Peter L. Scott
17 were signatories to the CSA. They have a vital interest in the University's compliance with the CSA and
18 with this Court's Judgment requiring the parties' adherence to it.

19 17. The CSA was the culmination of several years of litigation and negotiation between
20 Petitioners, the University, the City of Santa Cruz, the County of Santa Cruz, vitally interested
21 community groups including the Rural Bonny Doon Association and the Coalition for Limiting
22 University Expansion, and other concerned citizens. The CSA is the direct outgrowth of this Court's
23 direction that the parties engage in a constructive mediation following the Court's entry of rulings
24 overturning the University's 2005 LRDP due to its failure to adequately address the impacts of proposed
25 expansion of the UCSC campus on traffic, housing and water supplies. It represents the product of
26 months of hard work by the parties to that litigation to achieve a fair, balanced and constructive resolution
27 of their differing interests and concerns regarding how best to accommodate the University's long-term
28 plans for development of UCSC while recognizing and mitigating the impacts on traffic, housing, water

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 7 -

1 supplies and sensitive coastal environmental resources.

2 18. Petitioners seek guidance from this Court as to the proper interpretation and
3 implementation of the CSA's key enrollment cap and its requirement for comprehensive analysis of
4 alternative locations for enrollment growth, both with respect to the permissible scope and timing of the
5 large-scale SHW Project, and going forward, the permissible scope, location and timing of other
6 contemplated development of the UCSC campus, and growth of its student population. According to the
7 University, the undergraduate enrollment at the UCSC campus for the 2018-2019 school year was 16,983
8 FTE (3-quarter average), and 17,207 for Fall of 2020: Usually the undergraduate population declines

Q slightly from fall to winter and again from winter to spring. The SHW Project, by the University's own
10 projections, is intended to house nearly 3,000 students, including at least 2,712 undergraduate student
11 beds. Yet, until the next LRDP is adopted, under the CSA the undergraduate student population is
12 |capped at 17,500 FTE on-campus students - only about 500 more students than last school year's
13 population of about 17,000, and about 2,200 fewer students than the SHW Project would bring onto the
14 campus. (CSA § 1.1.) Further, the SHW Project required, and its approval by the University constituted,
15 la "major amendment to the 2005 LRDP" within the meaning of CSA section 5.1. Yet the University
16 failed to "include a comprehensive analysis of potentially feasible alternative locations to accommodate
17  proposed UCSC enrollment growth beyond that analyzed in the 2005 LRDP EIR [such as] satellite
18 campuses [and] remote-classrooms" in its review and approval of the SHW Project, contrary to section
19 5.1. Similarly, the University may not adopt the next, or 2021,4 LRDP without first completing the
20 |comprehensive analysis of potentially feasible alternative locations" for housing students that is required
21 |by CSA section 5.1. To date, the University has still not conducted that required comprehensive analysis.

22 19. According to the University's own analysis, the SHW Project would impact scenic,
23 biological and watershed resources in the East Meadow. The extraordinary, iconic beauty of the East
24 Meadow would be permanently degraded. The SHW Project's water demand would negatively impact
25 the City of Santa Cruz's already overcommitted water supply. According to the City, its water supply

26

27 Originally, the next LRDP was to be the 2020 LRDP but due to delays in the planning process, it has
28 Inow been dubbed the 2021 LRDP. Some planning documents from before this change still refer to the
2020 LRDP.

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 8 -

1 a Jalready suffers from a substantial shortfall during multiple dry years. Habitat important to imperiled
2 species, including burrowing owls and California red-legged frogs, would also be impacted. Under
3 the CSA, the University is obligated to conduct "comprehensive analysis" of alternative off-campus

4 locations to accommodate this enrollment growth that might lessen its impacts. Yet, the University
5 does not appear to recognize its responsibilities under the CSA. It has not acknowledged, let alone
6 addressed, its obligation under the CSA to cap the undergraduate student population at 17,500 students
7until the next LRDP is approved, nor its duty under the CSA to conduct a comprehensive analysis of
8 | feasible alternative locations to on-campus growth before it may approve the next major it amendment to

9 the 2005 LRDP such as the SHW Project or the next LRDP. Because it therefore appears that the
10 University does not consider these CSA limitations applicable to the University's major amendments to
11 (or replacement of) the 2005 LRDP even though they allow, enable and exert substantial financial
12 pressure on the University to-increase enrollment beyond the cap in order to ensure a high SHW
13 Project occupancy rate, Petitioners seek this Court's guidance.

14 20. The need for proactive guidance from this Court has been building for years but recently
15 came to a head when the University approved, and then re-approved, the SHW Project. Not only does the
16 approval have significant CEQA implications, but as noted, the SHW Project is a major amendment to
17 the 2005 LRDP, and the CSA requires a comprehensive analysis of potentially feasible alternative
18 llocations to accommodate growth before such an amendment may be approved. Additionally, the CSA
19 caps UCSC's undergraduate population at 17,500 students so long as the 2005 LRDP is in effect. Yet,
20 the SHW Project would enable and financially compel an increase in UCSC's undergraduate population
21 from about 17,000 currently to nearly 20,000 students - about 2,500 students more than the CSA allows.
22 | At the same time, UCSC has asserted in its Draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") on its Draft
23 2021 LRDP that it considers the SHW Project to be part of the existing environment whose impacts are
24 therefore not considered in that DEIR. By treating the SHW Project as if it already exists in the 2021
25 LRDP DEIR and therefore ignoring its impacts, the University is both violating CEQA and overlooking
26 its duties under sections 1.1 and 5.1 of the CSA. Consequently, it is painting itself - and the public - into

27 a corner.

28 21. Accordingly, Petitioners seek:

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 9-

(1) a writ of mandate setting aside the SHW Project and its Approvals, and an injunction
2 forbidding implementation of those Approvals, until such time as the University complies with CEQA;

3 (2) declaratory relief clarifying the University's obligations under the CSA, an injunction
4 requiring the University to comply with those provisions and an order commanding the University's
5 specific performance of its duties.

6 PARTIES

7 22. Petitioner HABITAT AND WATERSHED CARETAKERS ("HAWC*) is a public
8 interest citizens organization whose members reside within the County of Santa Cruz and use and enjoy
9 environmental resources that would be adversely impacted by the University's approval and
10 implementation of the SHW Project. HAWC and its members actively participated in the administrative
11 proceedings that preceded the University's adoption of the Approvals. Their environmental, aesthetic,
12 recreational, scenic, scientific, historic, cultural and community interests will, unless the relief requested
13 herein is granted, be adversely affected by the University's failure to comply with CEQA and the CSA in
14 approving the SHW Project. The University's approval of the Project and its FEIR will harm HAWC and
15 its members because the Project will degrade extraordinary aesthetic resources, over-commit scared
16 ground and surface water supplies to unnecessary growth, undermine UCSC's public-interest values, and
17 cause significant adverse environmental impacts to the public's use and enjoyment of UCSC lands,
18 waters, wildlife and scenery.

19 23. Petitioners DON STEVENS, RUSSELL B. WEISZ, HAL LEVIN, HARRY B. HUSKEY
20 and PETER L. SCOTT are concerned citizens and signatories to the 2008 CSA. They use and enjoy
21 environmental resources that are adversely impacted by the University's approval of campus development
22 and student growth that do not comply with CEQA and the CSA. They have performed all of their
23 obligations under the CSA and rely on the University to uphold its obligations as well. The University's
24 ongoing failure to acknowledge and comply with its duties under the CSA impairs their use and
25 enjoyment of the lands, waters, wildlife and scenery impacted by the University's rapid growth and
26 development. Their environmental, aesthetic, recreational, scenic, scientific, historic, cultural and
27 community interests will, unless the relief requested herein is granted, be adversely affected by the
28 University's violation of the CSA's cap on undergraduate enrollment and failure to complete a

3 24. Petitioners availed themselves of all available administrative remedies to address the

4 University's violation of CEQA by commenting and objecting at every opportunity. They gave prior
5 notice of this proceeding to the University and the California Attorney General in accordance with
6 applicable law, as documented in Petitioners' Proof of Service of their Notice of Intent to File CEQA
7 Action and Notice to California Attorney General, respectively, filed concurrently herewith.

8 25. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law within
9 the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 1086, in that the University's approval of the Project is
10 Inot otherwise reviewable in a manner that provides an adequate remedy.

11 26. Respondent THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA owns and
12 manages the Santa Cruz Campus of the University of California. The Regents have "full powers of
13 organization and governance" over the University of California, including the UCSC campus, under
14 article IX, section 9, of the California Constitution. On August 15, 2008, former UCSC Chancellor
15 George Blumenthal approved the CSA on behalf of The Regents. On or about March 14, 2019, The
16 Regents, through its governing Board, approved the SHW Project for the first time. After setting aside
17 the Findings, Statement of Overriding Considerations, Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program,
18 and design for the Project as commanded by this Court, the Regents re-approved the Project and issued
19 the NOD on or about March 18, 2021.

20 27. Respondent UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT SANTA CRUZ, or UCSC, is not an
21 lindependent legal entity separate from The Regents of the University of California. However, it was a
22 separately named party to the CSA, and is named as the "applicant" for the Project in the University's
23 SHW Project approval documents. For these reasons, it is independently named as a Respondent in this
24 litigation.

25 28. The true names and capacities of Respondents DOES I-XX, inclusive, are unknown to
26 Petitioners who therefore sue said Respondents by such fictitious names pursuant to Code of Civil
27 Procedure section 474. Petitioners will seek leave of Court to amend this Petition when the true names
28 and capacities of said DOE Respondents have been ascertained.

F 29. Real Parties in Interest CITY OF SANTA CRUZ and COUNTY OF SANTA CRUZ are
2 local governments that are signatories to the CSA and have an interest in its interpretation and
3 implementation.

4 30. Real party in Interest CAPSTONE DEVELOPMENT PARTNERS LLC ("Capstone" or
5 "CDP") is a limited liability company organized under the laws of Alabama. Capstone is identified as a
6 party undertaking the SHW Project in the University's approval documents, and is therefore named as a
7 Real Party in Interest in this litigation. It has a financial or other beneficial interest in the SHW Project.
8 Capstone will develop cost estimates for the Project and project alternatives, design and build the
9 buildings and set rent and fees in collaboration with UCSC, and in conjunction with its non-profit
10 affiliate who will ground lease the two sites Collegiate Housing Foundation {**CHF*) - arrange for
11 project financing. It will also make a profit constructing the SHW Project based on a percentage of total.
12 construction costs. Since the ongoing financial success of the SHW Project will be dependent on its
13 Jachieving a high occupancy rate, Capstone: and the University have a shared interest in assuring that the
14 SHW Project is fully occupied promptly after completion. However, if this occurs before the 2021 LRDP
15 is adopted, the campus population will substantially exceed the CSA cap on undergraduate enrollment.

16 31. Real Party in Interest COLLEGIATE HOUSING FOUNDATION ("CHF") is believed to
17 be a company organized under the laws of Alabama. It will ground lease the two sites for the SHW
18 Project. CHF has a financial or other beneficial interest in the SHW Project. Collegiate Housing
19 Foundation is a non-profit owner of student rental housing. It is identified as a party undertaking the
20  SHW Project in the University's approval documents. For this reason, it is named as a Real Party in
21 Interest in this litigation.

22 32. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest DOES
23 |XXI-L, and therefore sue said Real Parties in Interest by such fictitious names. Petitioners are informed
24 and believe, and based on such information and belief allege, that the fictitiously named Real Parties in
25 Interest are either responsible in some way for the above-described threatened injury to Petitioners, or
26 otherwise have a direct economic interest in the approval of the SHW Project or other future UCSC
27 development in a manner contrary to the CSA and therefore adverse to Petitioners' interests. When the
28 true identities and capacities of these Real Parties in Interest have been determined, Petitioners will, with

15 FACTS

16 36. The 2005 LRDP provides a comprehensive framework for the physical development of the
17 UCSC campus. All development on campus must be consistent with the planning guidance set forth in
18 the 2005 LRDP, including its overarching goal of "maintaining the campus's strong traditions of
19 environmental stewardship and sustainability." (2005 LRDP at p. 1.) The 2005 LRDP remains in effect.

20 37. In 2008, Petitioners entered into the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement ("CSA") with
21 the University, UCSC, the City of Santa Cruz, the County of Santa Cruz and other parties, following
22 Petitioners' successful challenge to the 2005 LRDP.

23 38. The CSA caps undergraduate enrollment at UCSC at 17,500 FTE students "[fJor as long as
24 the 2005 LRDP is in effect." (CSA § 1.1.) The University does not expect to adopt its next ("2021")
25 LRDP until at least the fall of 2021.

26 39. The CSA requires UCSC to house 67 percent of new student enrollment above a baseline
27 of 15,000 three-quarter average FTE. (CSA § 2.1(b).)

28 40. The CSA mandates "that the next major amendment to the 2005 LRDP . .. include a

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 13 -

1 comprehensive analysis of potentially feasible alternative locations to accommodate proposed UCSC
2 enrollment growth beyond that analyzed in the 2005 LRDP EIR." (CSA § 5.1.)

3 41. Subsequently, the University started exploring housing development options on the
4 campus and the SHW Project was the result. The SHW Project would add approximately 3,000 student
5 beds at two sites - the Heller site and the Hagar site - on the UCSC campus, with construction originally
6 Iproposed to commence in or after 2019. Construction has not yet commenced and is not anticipated until
7 the winter or spring of 2022. (Board of Regents of the University of California, Finance and Capital
8 Strategies Committee, March 17-18, 2021 Agenda Item F5 Staff Report, p. 7.)

9 42. The Heller site is located near the west entrance to the UCSC campus. The SHW Project's
10  proposed development of this site comprises five buildings, up to seven stories tall, with apartments that
11 would provide approximately 2,712 undergraduate student beds and 220 graduate student beds, for a total
12 of 2,932 new beds. Laundry, mail, and custodial facilities, as well as other support spaces, would also be
13 constructed at the Heller site.

14 43. The SHW Project's proposed development of the Hagar site would permanently convert
15 17 acres of pristine meadow in the southeast portion of the campus - widely known as the East Meadow

16 to family student housing. The Hagar site would be developed with 140 new student units in two-story
17 townhouses, a 3,500 square foot community building, and a 1,375 quare foot maintenance building,
18 among other infrastructure.

19 44. The University claims that the SHW Project is necessary to meet the goal of housing 67
20 /percent of the 2005 LRDP's 19,500 FTE enrollment goal. However, the SHW Project is not necessary to
21 lachieve this goal. The University has acknowledged that as of 2017 only 726 new on-campus beds were
22 Ineeded to accomplish the on-campus housing goal set forth in the CSA. Those beds can be provided by
23 the previously proposed East Campus Infill Project, which was approved by the Regents in 2009 and
24 would provide nearly 600 beds, and the current Kresge College Non-Academic Project, which would
25 provide 187 additional student beds, among other improvements. Indeed, according to a report issued by
26 The Regents' Committee on Grounds and Buildings dated July 14, 2009, the East Campus Infill Project
27 «is needed to provide additional housing inventory to meet the student housing demand, housing
28 guarantees, and student housing commitments identified in the 2005 Long Range Development Plan

|VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 14 -

1 Comprehensive Settlement Agreement.'5 However, according to Frank Zwart, the campus architect at
2 that time, the University decided not to proceed with the East Campus Infill Project due to concerns that

3 there would not be sufficient demand, even though contractor bids were coming in substantially below
the initial estimated project costs.
5 (https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5aa8064bb98a7807c929fbed/t/5bdbcd7188251bdc1090d1d9/1541
6 131641709/4+RDEIR+Zwart+Comments.pdf) A statement made at the Building and Grounds
7 Committee meeting for the July 2016 Regents meeting confirms that the SHW Project is not needed to
meet the CSA's housing requirements. "[F]he requirements of the CSA [have been] met primarily by
Q increasing density." (Board of Regents of the University of California, Grounds and Buildings
10 Committee, July 19 and 21, 2016 Meeting Minutes, p. 4.)

11 45. Even assuming that all of those 726 beds were needed for undergraduate students, the 187
12 beds from the Kresge redevelopment will reduce that number to 539 beds, and the SHW Project would
13 still add 2,173 more undergraduate student beds than needed under the CSA. Moreover, the existing
14 supply of on-campus student housing exceeds current demand. According to the University's Associate
15 Director of Colleges, Housing and Educational Services, 711 on-campus student beds at UCSC were

16 unoccupied during Winter Quarter 2020, contrary to University claims that more on-campus student

17 housing is urgently needed to meet existing demand. (https://www.cityonahillpress.com/2020/02/07/711-
18 empty-beds-on-campus/)

19 46. Conversely, adding over 2,100 more undergraduate student beds than needed would, if the
20 beds are occupied with undergraduate students as the University expressly intends and proposes to do,
21 cause the exceedance of the CSA's 17,500 undergraduate student cap by more than 2,100 students. (CSA
22 § 1.1.) By adding and causing the occupancy of substantially more student beds than the CSA's 17,500-
23 student cap allows, the SHW Project upends the 2005 LRDP's careful balance of campus development
24 with environmental protection, resulting in needless development of the pristine and iconic East Meadow.

25 47. It appears from the University's own statements that the unstated purpose behind the SHW
26 Project is to preemptively open the door to future growth on campus in excess of the CSA's cap on

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 15 -

Jundergraduate student enrollment of 17,500. (CSA § 1.1.) At the July 19, 2016 meeting of The Regents,
2 UCSC staff presented an "Update On Housing Demand" that portrayed the SHW Project as a "Strategic
Program" that "addresses future demand and enrollment growth." Page 4 of that Update is a chart
4 entitled "Projected Bed Growth and Demand" showing undergraduate enrollment increasing from the
5 current 17,000 students to 20,000 students by 2024. Recently retired UCSC Chancellor George
6 Blumenthal stated the housing strategy "was designed to meet UCSC's short- and long-term needs in the
7 context of enrollment growth," and "to respond to the University's accelerated pace of enrollment
8 growth." (Https://regents.universityofcalifornia.edu/minutes/2016/gb7.pdf) On January 12, 2018

9 Chancellor Blumenthal announced his intent to expand the campus by approximately 10,000 FTE
10 students, to "28,000 students by 2040," "from the roughly 18,000 students [UCSC] accommodate[s]
11 today." (Chancellor George Blumenthal, 2020 Long Range Development Plan Update, January 12,
12 2018.) The University's announced intention to expand the main campus population by 10,000 students-
13 without first conducting a comprehensive analysis of the feasible alternatives to on-campus growth-such
14 as satellite campuses and remote classrooms - conflicts with the requirement in CSA section 5.1 for that
15 analysis.

16 48. The University has adopted the Public Private Partnership ("PPP") model system-wide,
17 including for the SHW Project, in order to attract private financing for its expansion projects. However,
18  in the present circumstance, this model has induced the University to pursue a project that is larger than
19 what is needed solely for, or authorized by, the 2005 LRDP, in violation of the CSA. The original basis
20 for the SHW Project was the meticulous, year-long 2014-2015 SHW Campus Housing Study issued in
21 July 2015. It concluded that "housing for first year and lower division students is currently sufficient"
22 land specified 900 new upper division/graduate beds to be built in two phases. However, with the
23 adoption of the Public Private Partnership model in 2016, the University abruptly abandoned the findings
24 of the 2015 study and, reversing course, expanded the SHW Project to over 3,000 beds. It subsequently
25 proposed to build the undergraduate and graduate housing at the Heller site as one large project rather
26 than in multiple phases over time, consistent with the "Update On Housing Demand" statement that the
27 SHW Project was "scaled to attract interest from developers and maximize return."

28 49. Unlike all previous campus housing projects, the much larger scale of the SHW Project

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 16 -

1 involves substantially greater risk that may necessitate and contractually obligate UCSC to accelerate
2 enrollment growth to ensure sufficient revenue for debt service payments to private bond holders,
3 notwithstanding the CSA's cap on enrollment and required comprehensive analysis of off-campus
4 lalternative locations for growth. The PPP's private financing mechanism also precludes updating,
5 refurbishing or retrofitting existing structures on campus to meet housing needs because it requires all
6 buildings to be entirely new construction and wholly owned and managed by outside entities on long-term
7 ground leases, in order to qualify as collateral for the loans.

8 50. The University's decision to contract: with Capstone Development and Collegiate Housing

9 Foundation as part of its Public Private Partnership prejudices the 2021 LRDP planning process in favor
10 of on-campus growth and in derogation of potential off-campus locations for growth, in contravention of
11 the CSA section 5.1 requirement that the University prepare a "comprehensive analysis of potentially
12 feasible alternative locations to accommodate proposed UCSC enrollment growth beyond that analyzed
13 in the 2005 LRDP EIR (i.e., satellite campuses, remote-classrooms, etc.)" before approving a major
14 llamendment to the 2005 LRDP.

15 51. The SHW Project's allowance of growth on campus in excess of the CSA's cap on the
16 undergraduate population, and beyond enrollment analyzed in the 2005 LRDP, also violates the CSA's
17 mandate that before approving any major amendment to the 2005 LRDP, the University must first
18 conduct a "comprehensive analysis" of potentially feasible alternative locations including satellite

19 campuses and remote-classrooms. (CSA § 5.1.)

20 52. Such alternative locations already-exist. For example, the University owns almost 1,100
21 acres in Marina that already have land use entitlements and infrastructure allowing their development as a
22 satellite campus. This off-campus alternative location for a satellite campus is thus potentially feasible.
23 Indeed, it appears that it could provide less expensive student housing with less environmental damage
24 than further expansion of the UCSC campus. For these reasons, among others, in their written comments
25 on the SHW Project before its initial approval, Petitioners asked the University to specifically consider
26 and analyze this potentially feasible alternative location for campus growth as an alternative to approving
27 the SHW Project.

28 53. On or about March 14, 2019, The Regents, through its governing Board, initially approved

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 17 -

1 the SHW Project. Before The Regents approved the SHW Project, Petitioners and others apprised the
2 University of the fact that by inducing on-campus undergraduate growth in excess of what the 2005
3 LRDP allowed, the SHW Project would prejudice the 2021 LRDP's consideration of potentially feasible
4 alternative locations for future campus growth.

5 54. Petitioners and others also informed the University about the myriad deficiencies in the
6 environmental analysis for the Project. Two lawsuits were brought against the University challenging the
7 initial approval, including one suit by petitioners. As a result of the second lawsuit, brought by East
8 Meadow Action Committee, this Court ruled that-the University's approvals violated CEQA and must be
9 set aside. (Bast Meadow Action Committee v. Regents, Case No. 19CV01312, Judgment issued October
10 30, 2020.) Specifically, the Court "issued a writ of mandate directing the Regents to set aside the Project
11 design approval, the CEQA Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations, and the Mitigation
12 Monitoring and Reporting Program." (Board of Regents of the University of California, Finance and
13 Capital Strategies Committee, March 17-18, 2021 Agenda Item F5 Staff Report, p. 2.)

14 55. At the March 17-18 Regents Board meeting, the Regents considered and approved
15 Imotions to set aside its 2019 initial Project Approvals, and then re-approve the Project. (Board of
16 Regents of the University of California, Finance and Capital Strategies Committee, March 17-18, 2021,
17 Approvals, pp. 3-4; Board of Regents of the University of California, Finance and Capital Strategies
18 Committee, March 17-18, 2021 Agenda Item F5 Staff Report, Attachments and 7.) The University's re-
19 approval of the SHW Project is not subject to further administrative review.

20 56. However, the documents on which that re-approval relies are substantially similar, and at
21 Itimes identical, to the documents approved in 2019. The Project design packages are identical and the
22 Statements of Overriding Considerations are nearly identical. The Findings are substantially similar and
23 provide little new information.

24 57. None of the publicly-available documents on which the University purported to base its
25 2021 Project Approvals state that the University should or might impose a 30 percent below market rate
26 requirement for the new student housing, nor that the University would define "affordable" by that
27 criterion. Nor do any of the University's publicly available supporting documents accurately describe and
28 document the off-campus local housing market for students in comparison with the existing and projected

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 18 -

T costs of on-campus student housing. The University apparently is basing its affordability evaluation on
2 false or misleading data, as the existing and projected cost of on-campus housing is roughly double the

3 cost of comparable off-campus housing. Because the rental rates in the SHW Project would be at least

4 double the rates of comparable off-campus housing, and thus the 30 percent below market criterion would
5 Inot be met, the entire SHW Project is financially infeasible. The Regents demonstrated a lack of
6 awareness of the actual, documented cost to students of off-campus housing as compared to comparable
7 on-campus housing. University Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Nathan Brostrom.
8 should have known of this disparity, based on the financial documents available to him. Yet during the

Q |March 17, 2021 Regents meeting at which the University reapproved the SHW Project, Mr. Brostrom
10 advised the Regents that "[u]nder the current business terms, the project is substantially below market."

11 58. The 2021 Staff Report claims that the University "is being provided herein with the-
12 information, including economic information, from the campus regarding the feasibility of the
13 lalternatives in compliance with the writ issued by the court, as summarized in Attachment 8." (Board of
14 Regents of the University of California, Finance and Capital Strategies Committee, March 17-18, 2021
15 Agenda Item F5 Staff Report, p. 16.) But Attachment 8, "Cost Estimates for Project Alternatives,"
16 actually provides less information than it did in 2019. This is especially problematic given the numerous
17 failures in cost analysis.

18 59. The community around UCSC has traditionally been a "very tight housing market,
19 lespecially as it relates to rental housing." (2021 LRDP DEIR at 3.13-5.) According to the 2005 LRDP,
20 housing is "key issue[] essential to the planning processes of UCSC." (2005 LRDP, p. 23.) The
21 "housing market is influenced by several factors, including proximity to major job centers, low for-sale
22 |inventory, and an "extremely tight" rental market." (2021 LRDP DEIR at 3.13-5.)

23 60. As Chancellor Larive noted during the March 2021 Regents meeting, "there is nothing
24 ore important than having a safe and affordable place to live." Regent Makarechian likewise
25 commented that "affordability for students is the most important part of this" Project, and that the
26 Regents should ensure the 30 percent below market guarantee is met.

27 61. Yet the University, and specifically Chancellor Larive, wavered on that commitment time
28  and time again at that meeting. After repeatedly saying that no commitment could be made, Chancellor

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 19 -

T Larive did agree to make a personal commitment to bring the project in at 30 percent below market rate,
2 but in the same sentence, tempered that commitment with the comment that she still did not have bids, so
3 she was reluctant to do so. Furthermore, Chancellor Larive did not specify the off-campus student
4 housing market rates to which the Project would be compared.

5 62. In 2019, the UC Office of the President defined the monthly rental market rate to be $880
6 per student. (UCOP, Setting the Total Cost of Attendance at UC, December 2019, p. 14.) Therefore 30
7 lpercent below that market rate would be $616.

8 63. But the SHW projected a weighted average rent for undergraduates, as of 2018, at $1,563.
(AECOM, Supplementary Campus Report Appendix 5, March 2019, p. 1.) That is 2.5 times higher than o

10 the $616 that would constitute 30 percent below market for the next year.

11 64. SHW prices well above market rate are consistent with housing costs for UCSC, even
12 now. Chancellor Larive asserted at the March 2021 Regents meeting that current on-campus housing
13 rates are well below market. But that is simply not true. As noted above, in 2018 off-campus market
14 rates for students averaged $880. The on-campus rental rate per student for the 2020-2021 school year,
15 however, was approximately $1,580 per month - almost double the off-campus market rates.°

16 65. The study the University relies on to support its erroneous claims regarding affordability,
17 and the need for that housing, is fatally flawed. It ignores data regarding housing prices (including
18 University data), it conflates off-campus housing rates per room with a per-person rate, and it entirely
19 fails to account for rental of single-family houses (which house approximately 44 percent of off-campus
20 renters) and for small apartment complexes. (Brailsford & Dunlavey, Housing Demand Analysis, 2018.)
21 Furthermore, the high-end apartment complexes the study did rely upon are priced at the top of the
22 market and cater to high-income professionals - not - students.

23 66. It is therefore not surprising that the report contradicts its own conclusions. It
24 simultaneously reports that "the average rental rates for the Student Housing West Two-Bedroom /
25 Two-Bathroom double occupancy apartments were 60% higher than a comparable unit in the off-campus

26

27 The 2020-2021 rate for a shared dorm room, including a meal plan, is $2,230 per month, although 28 currently there is a discount from that rate due to the pandemic shutdown. Removing the Japproximately $650 cost for a meal plan leaves a room-only cost of $1,580 per month.

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 20 -

1 market," but then makes the unexplained conclusion that SHW rental rates are more affordable.

2 67. Despite the fact that the SHW Project will not provide the affordable housing it claims it
3 will, the University still plans to proceed with the Project and add more beds than necessary or allowed.

4 And the cost analysis provided to the public fails to adequately discuss the use of off-site alternatives

5 such as satellite campuses and remote classrooms. The assumption that on-campus student population
6 growth is an inevitable force that the campus must accommodate underlies the entire Project, and creates
7 a. false barrier to consideration of alternatives that would lessen the Project's significant impacts.

8 68. The Staff Report states that additional information was provided to the Regents, but
9 providing that information only to the Board does not satisfy CEQA, or the CSA. CEQA requires
10 | Findings and Statements of Overriding Considerations to be supported by substantial evidence in the
11 public record. (14-C.C.R. §§ 15091(b), 15093(b).) Here, they are not. CSA section 5.1 requires that the
12 University prepare a "comprehensive analysis of potentially feasible alternative locations to accommodate
13 proposed UCSC enrollment growth beyond that analyzed in the 2005 LRDP EIR (i.e., satellite campuses,
14 remote-classrooms, etc.)* before approving major amendment to the 2005 LRDP. It did not.

15 :69. The University approved the SHW Project - and thereby enables and financially compels
16 on-campus undergraduate enrollment growth that exceeds the 2005 LRDP's analysis and the CSA's cap
17 on the undergraduate student population pursuant to section 1.1 - without first conducting the
18 *comprehensive analysis of potentially feasible alternative locations to accommodate proposed UCSC
19 enrollment growth" that section 5.1 of the CSA requires be completed before any major amendment of
20 the 2005 LRDP may be adopted.

21 70. The University held public meetings regarding alternate visions for the 2021 LRDP in the
22 fall of 2019 and released its "Final Proposed Land Use Map" on December 2, 2019 without first
23 conducting a comprehensive analysis of potentially feasible alternative growth locations that CSA section
24 5.1 requires be completed before any major amendment of the 2005 LRDP may be adopted. On February
25 25, 2020, the University released its Notice of Preparation for the 2020 LRDP Environmental Impact
26 Report. And in January 2021, the University released the Draft 2021 LRDP and related Draft
27 Environmental Impact Report. It uses the Final Proposed Land Use Map that was released on December
28 2, 2019 and proposes housing 100 percent of all new students on the main campus rather than considering

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 21 -

1 alternatives to growth on the main campus such as satellite campuses.

2 71. The University's Draft 2021 LRDP, and the documents released during the planning

3 Iprocess, all fail to identify, let alone analyze, alternative off-campus locations to accommodate student
population growth such as the almost 1,100-acre property the University owns in Marina. As noted, that
lproperty already has land use entitlements and infrastructure allowing its development a as a satellite
6 campus. But the 2021 LRDP DEIR dismissed all but one off-campus alternative, violating its contractual
duty to provide - and the Superior Court's Judgment requiring - a comprehensive analysis of alternative
8 locations to accommodate growth. Indeed, the 2021 LRDP DEIR dismisses every off-campus alternative
9 lon the basis that it fails to meet the "objective of placing new facilities near existing facilities to enhance
10 synergies between existing and new educational and research programs." (2021 LRDP DEIR at 6-4 to 6-
11 6.) But there is more than one way to enhance synergy between new and existing educational resources.
12 Restricting all alternatives to on-campus ones - in a time where we can readily observe how successful
13 remote learning can be - subverts CEQA's core purpose of exploring a reasonable range of alternatives to
14 avoid and reduce environmental harm.

15 72. Rather than examine alternative housing locations such as the Marina site, the University
16 has prematurely narrowed its consideration of alternatives to those that are restricted exclusively to
17 expanding the existing main campus, contrary to the CSA's imperative that no major amendment to the
18 2005 LRDP be adopted until the University has first prepared a "comprehensive analysis of potentially
19 feasible alternative locations to accommodate proposed UCSC enrollment growth beyond that analyzed

20 1n the 2005 LRDP EIR (i.e., satellite campuses, remote-classrooms, etc.)." (CSA §5.1.)

21 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

22 (CEQA)

23 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)

24 73. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by

25 reference.

26 74. CEQA forbids approval of any project that will have significant environmental effects
27 unless and until the lead agency makes "written findings for each of those significant effects,
28 accompanied by a brief explanation of the rationale for each finding." (14 C.C.R. §§ 15091(a),

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 22 -

1 15092(b).) The findings must "be supported by substantial evidence in the record." (14 C.C.R. §
2 15091(b).)

3 75. An agency may not "approve or carry out a project" with unavoidable significant impacts,
4 such as here, unless the agency has:

5 "(A) Eliminated or substantially lessened all significant effects on the environment where

6 feasible as shown in findings under Section15091, and

7 (B) Determined that any remaining significant effects on the environment found to be

8 unavoidable under Section 15091 are acceptable due to overriding concerns as described

9 in Section 15093."

10 (14 C.C.R. § 15092(b)(2).)

11 76. CEQA's requirement for a Statement of Overriding Considerations, pursuant to section
12 15093, demands that when approving "a project which will result in the occurrence of [unavoidable]
13 significant effects. . . , the agency shall state in writing the specific reasons to support its action based on

14 the final EIR and/or other information in the record." (14 C.C.R. § 15093(b).)- Like the Findings, the
15 Statement of Overriding Considerations must also be supported by substantial evidence in the record. (14
16 C.C.R. § 15093(b).)

17 77. The University's approval of the Project, adoption of the MMRP, CEQA Findings, and
18 Statement of Overriding Considerations, approval of the Project design, and issuance of the March 18,
19 2021 NOD for the Project, constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that the University failed to
20 proceed in the manner required by law, and its Approvals are not supported by substantial evidence, in
21 the following respects, among others.

22 78. The Findings adopted by the University to support its decision fail to acknowledge, much
23 lless rectify, the significant methodological, analytical and factual errors and omissions in the University's
24 environmental review. For example, the Findings rely on mitigation measures that will not be effective to
25 reduce the identified impacts to insignificance. The MMRP fails to remedy these deficiencies.

26 79. Furthermore, the Findings fail to explain, based on substantial evidence in the record, how
27 the SHW Project will actually provide affordable housing for students. As shown above, the SHW
28 Project's housing rates, like the high rates of other on-campus housing, will far exceed off-campus market

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT • 23 -

1 rates and provide no economic incentive for students to return to campus as the Project assumes. Since
2 the affordability incentive, along with other incentives such as the desire to avoid institutional style
3 housing and the ability to have a car that cause students to live in off-campus housing, will not be
4 changed, the SHW Project would not achieve its ostensible objectives. Instead, it would allow for
5 significant construction and operation impacts with very little benefit. The University's Findings and
6 Statement of Overriding Considerations entirely fail to address this shortcoming.

7 80. Additionally, the Findings fail to explain, based on substantial evidence, why alternatives
would be economically infeasible. In fact, there are numerous alternatives that would not only be
economically feasible, but possibly even beneficial to the University. However, those alternatives were
10 erroneously omitted from any cost analysis.

11 81. As discussed above, the cost of a SHW rental for a student will far exceed the current
12 market values and will certainly not meet the 30 percent below market value commitment made by the
13 University. Because the Findings, Statement of Overriding Considerations and Mitigation Monitoring
14 and Reporting Program do not address this significant impact, they are incomplete and fail to adequately
15 analyze the Project's impacts. Furthermore, the University's claimed "need" for the Project, on which the
16 Findings and Statement rely, is simply myth based on doctored numbers, incomplete data, and
17 artificially limited alternatives. This subverts CEQA's purpose of informed decisionmaking.

18 82. The Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations are thus not supported by
19 substantial evidence in the record, and fail to bridge the analytical gap between the Project's impacts and
20 the decision to proceed with the Project. (Topanga Association for a Scenic Community v. County of Los
21 Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 515.) Furthermore, both fail to consider and analyze alternatives and
22 mitigation measures that would substantially lessen the Project's impacts. Accordingly, they violate
23 CEQA. (14 C.C.R. §§ 15091(b), 15093(b).)

24 83. Petitioners are entitled to declaratory relief under CCP section 1060 because an actual
25 controversy exists between petitioners and the University respecting the University's SHW Approvals,
26 including its Findings, Statement of Overriding Considerations, Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting
27 Program, Design Approval, and NOD. Petitioners contend these approvals violate CEQA, while the
28 University contends they comply with CEQA.

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 24 -

84. Petitioners are entitled under CCP section 526 to injunctive relief forbidding any
2 implementation of the SHW Project and its Approvals unless and until the University has complied fully
3 with CEQA.

4 85. Petitioners are entitled to a writ of mandate setting aside the SHW Project and its
5 Approvals, including the University's Findings, Statement of Overriding Considerations, Mitigation
6 Monitoring and Reporting Program, Design Approval, and NOD.

7 86. Accordingly, this Court should issue a writ of mandate setting aside the Project Approvals
8 luntil the University fully complies with CEQA, including preparation of adequate and factually supported
9 Findings and a Statement of Overriding Considerations. To assure the University's compliance with
10 CEQA, this Court should issue an injunction forbidding construction and occupancy of the SHW Project
11  unless and until the University fully complies with these CEQA duties.

12 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

13 (Breach of Contract)

14 (Alleged by Petitioners Don Stevens, Russell B. Weisz, Hal Levin, Harry B. Huskey

15 and Peter L. Scott Against All Respondents)

16 87. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by

17 reference.

18 88. The CSA is a valid, existing and presently enforceable contract between petitioners and
19 the University. Petitioners are entitled to the University's performance of its obligations under this

20 Icontract.

21 89. This Court has retained jurisdiction over interpretation and implementation of the CSA.

22 90. The CSA provides that: "[f]or as long as the 2005 LRDP is in effect: [1] Full-time
23 equivalent . . . on-campus 3-[quarter] average (fall-winter-spring) enrollment . . for undergraduates will
24 Inot exceed 17,500." (CSA § 1.1.)

25 91. The CSA also mandates that before approving the next major amendment to the 2005
26 LRDP, the University must prepare a "comprehensive analysis of potentially feasible alternative locations
27 to accommodate proposed UCSC enrollment growth beyond that analyzed in the 2005 LRDP." (CSA §
28 (5.1.)

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT 25 -

92. The University's undergraduate enrollment for the 2018-2019 school year was 16,983
2 FTE, three-quarter average, students. Therefore, the University can only accept approximately 500 more
3 undergraduate students than were enrolled in Fall 2020 before it exceeds the CSA's 17,500-student
4 undergraduate enrollment cap.

5 93. As of 2017, the University required only 726 more beds to meet its obligations under the
6 CSA for housing for all types of students.

7 94. The SHW Project will add 2,712 undergraduate student beds, approximately 220 graduate
8 student beds, and 140 town-homes for family student housing (which could potentially house additional
9 undergraduate students with families).

10 95. The University is obligated to maintain the 17,500-student cap on undergraduate
11 enrollment until such time as the 2005 LRDP is no longer in effect. If it constructs the SHW Project, the
12 University will have built almost 2,200 more beds than necessary to meet its obligations under the CSA,
13 and roughly 2,400 more beds than the University is allowed to build and occupy with undergraduate
14 students without violating the CSA's cap on undergraduate enrollment. Therefore, by approving,
15 building and causing the occupancy of the SHW Project, the University is violating its duty under the
16 CSA to cap undergraduate enrollment at 17,500 FTE students for as long as the 2005 LRDP is in effect.

17 96. As noted, the University is also obligated by section 5.1 of the CSA to complete a
18 comprehensive analysis of potentially feasible alternatives, including satellite campuses and remote
19 classrooms, to accommodate enrollment growth beyond what was analyzed in the 2005 LRDP before the
20 University may approve any major amendment to the 2005 LRDP, including the SHW Project. By
21 approving the SHW Project (and thereby approving: major amendment to the 2005 LRDP) before
22 completing that required comprehensive analysis, the University failed to comply not just with the CSA
23 section 1.1 cap on undergraduate enrollment, but also with the CSA section 5.1 requirement for a
24 comprehensive analysis of alternative locations. Therefore, the University's approval of the SHW Project
25 and construction and occupancy of the SHW Project violate the CSA and the University's contractual
26 duties to petitioners.

27 97. Despite its continuing failure to prepare that required comprehensive analysis, in January
28 2021, the University released a Draft 2021 LRDP and related Draft Environmental Impact Report

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 26 -

t (*DEIR") that propose housing 100 percent of all new students on the main campus rather than
2 considering alternatives to growth on the main campus such as satellite campuses. To date, the
3 University has failed and continues to fail to provide the public with the required comprehensive analysis

4 of potentially feasible alternative locations for growth.

5 98. Petitioners and others requested that the University refrain from approving the SHW
6 Project until such time that an adequate 2021 LRDP - for which the required comprehensive alternatives
7 analysis has been completed before the LRDP's initiation as intended by the CSA - is completed and the
8 SHW Project can be reviewed for compliance with the 2021 LRDP. Despite this request, the University
9- approved, and reapproved, the SHW Project.

10 99. The University's approval of this large-scale SHW Project that provides many more beds
11 -than is required (or allowed) by the CSA also enables and financially compels the University to place its
12 thumb on the scales by jumping the gun-and prematurely committing itself to approval of a 2021 LRDP
13 that allows rapid development. In order to provide the lenders with the added security of increasing
14 (student demand for beds with continually expanding enrollment beyond 19,500 students, UCSC has
15 prematurely committed the public - and The Regents - to needlessly rapid development driven by
16 enrollment growth far beyond the 19,500 students now authorized by the 2005 LRDP.

17 100. As discussed above, the SHW Project enables and financially compels growth beyond
18 what is considered in the 2005 LRDP. Yet the Project likewise falls outside the scope of the 2021 LRDP.
19 The Draft 2021 LRDP discusses the Project as if its approval is a foregone conclusion. Despite the fact
20 that the SHW Project approvals had been overturned by the Superior Court at the time the Draft 2021
21 LRDP was released, the SHW Project is discussed throughout the 2021 LRDP DEIR as if it were already
22 lpart of the existing environment. Likewise, the student beds it might have provided had it been lawfully
23 approved - instead of being set aside by the court - are presumed to already exist in the 2021 LRDP
24 DEIR's discussion of impacts. (2021 LRDP DEIR at 3.6-12, 3.10-29, 3.13-2, 3.13-7, 3.16-34.)

25 101. Because the SHW Project was not contemplated by the 2005 LRDP, it must be considered
26 when analyzing growth under the 2021 LRDP. Yet the 2021 LRDP and its DEIR fail to analyze the SHW
27 Project and its impacts. This state of limbo in which the SHW Project exists - beyond the growth
28 contemplated in the 2005 LRDP but assumed to already be in existence prior to any growth contemplated

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 27 -

1 under the 2021 LRDP - will lead to campus expansion that is never analyzed in any development plan.

2 102. Making matters worse, the University has yet to complete a comprehensive analysis of
3 potentially feasible alternative locations to accommodate UCSC enrollment growth, but it has taken

4 substantial steps toward adopting the 2021 LRDP. Contrary to the CSA mandate, the University has
5 allowed the LRDP planning process to advance to the point where it is apparent that the University does
6 not intend to perform and provide public notice of the required analysis in a timely and good faith
7 |manner, making substantial performance impossible. Instead, the University has released its Draft 2021
8 LRDP and Draft Environmental Impact Report thereon without first identifying alternative, off-campus

9 locations for growth and conducting a comprehensive analysis of their feasibility and impacts.

10 103. Petitioners have performed all their obligations under the CSA.

11 104. Petitioners have no adequate remedy at law, as damages would not remedy the
12 University's breach of the CSA and the impacts of University expansion without compliance with the

13 CSA.

14 105. Petitioners are entitled to declaratory relief under CCP section 1060 because an actual
15 controversy exists between Petitioners and the University respecting the requirements of the CSA and
16 how they apply to the SHW Project and other major amendments to the 2005 LRDP.

17 106. Petitioners are entitled to specific performance of the University's contractual obligations
18 under the CSA pursuant to Civil Code sections 3367 and 3384, et seq.

19 107. Petitioners are entitled to an injunction forbidding the University from taking actions that
20 would cause a breach of its contractual obligations under the CSA pursuant to Civil Code sections 3368
21 and 3420, et seq-, and Code of Civil Procedure section 526.

22 108. Accordingly, this Court should order the University's specific performance of its duties
23 under the CSA, including compliance with the CSA's cap on undergraduate student enrollment at 17,500
24 undergraduates so long as the 2005 LRDP is in effect and completion of a comprehensive analysis of
25 feasible alternative locations to accommodate enrollment growth before approving any major amendment
26 of the 2005 LRDP. To assure the University's compliance with the CSA, this Court should issue an
27 injunction overturning the University's approval of the SHW Project and forbidding construction and
28 occupancy of the SHW Project, and adoption of the 2021 LRDP, unless and until the University fully

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT • 28 -

1 complies with these CSA duties.

2 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

3 (Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1085 and 1094.5)

4 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)

5 109. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by
6 reference.

7 110. The University proceeded in excess of its jurisdiction and abused its discretion in
8 /purporting to reapprove the SHW Project because such approval violates the University's duties under the

0 CSA and this Court's Judgment approving the CSA in the following respects, among others:

10 a. Such approval was not granted in accordance with the procedures required by law;

11 b. Such approval was not based-on the findings required by law; and

12 C. Such approval was not based on, or was contrary to, the evidence in the record

13 before the University.

14 111. The University failed to proceed in the manner required by law because it violated the
-15 CSA and this Court's Judgment approving the CSA as alleged hereinabove.

16 112. The University also failed to proceed in the manner required by law because it violated
17 CEQA as alleged hereinabove.

18 113. The University's actions in approving the SHW Project without complying with the
19 procedures required by Code of Civil Procedure 1085, et. seq., exceeded its jurisdiction and constitute a
20 prejudicial abuse of discretion, and therefore are invalid and must be set aside.

21 PRAYER

22 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for the following relief:

23 1. For a writ of mandate ordering the University to set aside and vacate its reapprovals of the

24 SHW Project, including its Findings, Statement of Overriding Considerations, Mitigation

25 Monitoring and Reporting Program, Design Approval, and NOD for failure to comply

26 with CEQA.

27 2. For declaratory relief declaring that the University's reapprovals of the SHW Project,

28 including its Findings, Statement of Overriding Considerations, Mitigation Monitoring and

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT 29 -

Reporting Program, Design Approval, and NOD are invalid under CEQA.

2 3. For an injunction restraining the University from taking any action to carry out the SHW

3 Project and its Approvals unless and until the University has complied fully with CEQA.

4 4. For declaratory relief declaring:

5 a. The CSA imposes a cap on undergraduate student enrollment at UCSC of 17,500

6 FTE undergraduate students for as long as the 2005 LRDP is in effect.

7 b. The 2005 LRDP was in effect on March 18, 2021, when the University purported

8 to approve the SHW Project, and will remain SO unless and until a valid 2021

9 LRDP is approved.

10 C. The University's reapproval of the SHW Project occurred while the 2005 LRDP

11 was in effect, and is thus subject to the undergraduate enrollment cap set forth in

12 CSA section 1.1.

13 d. The University's reapproval of the SHW Project is a major amendment of the 2005

14 LRDP and is thus subject to the requirement for a comprehensive analysis of

15 potentially feasible alternative locations set forth in CSA section 5.1.

16 e The SHW Project was reapproved in order to enable an increase in UCSC

17 undergraduate student enrollment of about 2,200 undergraduate students.

18 f. The SHW Project will enable an increase in UCSC undergraduate student

19 enrollment of about 2,200 undergraduate students.

20 g. During the 2019-2019 academic year, the average undergraduate student

21 population of UCSC was 16,983.

22 h. If the SHW Project is built, the undergraduate student population of UCSC will

23 increase to nearly 20,000 students, substantially in excess of the CSA's cap on the

24 undergraduate student population of 17,500.

25 I. To date, the University has not prepared the comprehensive analysis of potentially

26 feasible alternative locations required by CSA section 5.1.

27 j. The University's reapproval of the SHW Project was therefore contrary to and in

28 violation of the CSA.

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT •30 -

4 1.

5 The University may not approve the 2021 LRDP unless and until it has prepared

6 the comprehensive analysis of potentially feasible alternative locations required by
CSA section 5.1.

7 5. For specific performance of:

8 a.

9 The University's duty, pursuant to the CSA, to cap the undergraduate student

10 population at 17,500 until the next LRDP is adopted.

b.

11 The University's obligation under the CSA to complete a comprehensive analysis

12 of potentially feasible alternative locations to accommodate proposed enrollment

13 growth beyond that which was analyzed in the 2005 LRDP before the University

14 may approve any amendment to the 2005 LRDP, including approval of the SHW
Project and the next LRDP.

15 6.

16 For an injunction setting aside the University's reapproval of the SHW Project, and

17 forbidding the University from implementing the SHW Project unless and until the
University has complied fully with the CSA.

18 7.

19 For an injunction forbidding the University from adopting the 2021 LRDP without first

20 completing a comprehensive analysis of potentially feasible alternative locations to

21 accommodate proposed enrollment growth beyond that which was analyzed in the 2005

LRDP.

22 8.

23 a For a writ of mandate vacating the University's reapproval of the SHW Project without
compliance with the CSA.
