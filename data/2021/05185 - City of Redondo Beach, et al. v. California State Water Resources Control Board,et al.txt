22 1. INTRODUCTION

This lawsuit challenges the discretionary action of the California State Water
23 Resources Control Board ("Water Board") to approve an amendment to the Water Quality
24 Control Policy on the Use of Coastal and Estuarine Waters for Power Plant Cooling ("OTC
25 Policy") without fully analyzing, disclosing, or mitigating the adverse environmental
26 impacts of the OTC Policy amendment ("OTC Policy Amendment"). a As a result of the
27 Water Board's action and extension of deadlines, multiple power plants will be allowed to
28 continue operating without achieving full compliance under the OTC Policy, which is

-2-

•

intended to protect marine life from the harmful effects of cooling water intake structures at
2 coastal power plants.

3 2. Petitioners allege that the Water Board's September 1, 2020 reliance on an
4 un-adopted Addendum to its previously prepared substitute environmental document
5 violates multiple provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources
6 Code § 21000, et seq.) ("CEQA") and the CEQA Guidelines (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15000,
7 et seq.) ("CEQA Guidelines"), including but not limited to the following:

8

9

10 The Water Board improperly relied on a 10-year old substitute environmental

ATTORNEYS AT LAW - A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION RICHARDS WATSON GERSHON 11 document as its baseline environmental document and analysis, and failed to

12 consider new information and substantial evidence showing that there are

os changed circumstances and significant, adverse environmental impacts that
preclude the use of an Addendum;

14

15 The Water Board ignored substantial evidence demonstrating that the OTC

16 Policy Amendment and the extended operation of numerous power plants will

17 result in substantial adverse environmental impacts to air quality and marine
life, among other environmental impacts;

18
19 As a result of the Water Board's failure to sufficiently analyze and disclose

20 impacts, the Water Board also failed to impose effective, feasible, and

21 necessary mitigation measures to reduce such environmental impacts;

22 The Water Board failed to find that the Addendum, which was included in the

23 staff report prepared for the Water Board, reflected the Water Board's
independent judgment.

24

25 The Water Board failed to actually adopt or approve the Addendum to the

26 substitute environmental document, thereby resulting in the OTC Policy
Amendment being adopted without any environmental review.
As a result, the Water Board abused its discretion in that it failed to proceed as
27 required by law, and its purported reliance on the Addendum is not supported by substantial
28 evidence.

-6-

| R6900-1017\2462864v4.doc PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 section 401 and Government Code section 955.3, in that the Water Board is an agency of
2 the State of California, and the Attorney General of the State of California has an office
3 located in the County of Los Angeles.

4

5 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS AND BACKGROUND
The OTC Policy

6 18. On May 4, 2010, the Water Board adopted the OTC Policy which became
7 effective on October 1, 2010. The OTC Policy establishes uniform, technology-based
8 standards to implement Clean Water Act section 316(b), which requires that the location,

ATTORNEYS AT LAW - A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 9 design, construction, and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the best

7RICHARDS WATSON GERSHO 10 technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. Put simply, the OTC
11

13 Policy was adopted with the explicit purpose of minimizing adverse environmental impacts
12 to marine life resulting from use of coastal and estuarine waters for power plant cooling.
19. The OTC Policy was necessary because, as stated in the Water Board's staff
14 report prepared in connection with the OTC Policy Amendment, "Cooling water
15 withdrawals cause adverse impacts when larger aquatic organisms, such as fish and
16 mammals, are trapped against a facility's intake screens (impingement) and when smaller
17 marine life, such as larvae and eggs, are killed by being drawn through the cooling system
18 and exposed to high pressures and temperatures (entrainment)."

19 20. The OTC Policy applies to certain existing power plants located along the
20 California coast, including AES Redondo Beach, and is implemented through National
21 Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") permits, issued pursuant to Clean
22 Water Act section 402, which authorize the point source discharge of pollutants to
23 navigable waters.

24 21. The OTC Policy establishes a schedule that provides the latest compliance
25 date for the replacement, repowering, or retirement of each remaining power plant still
26 utilizing once-through cooling operations while accounting for potential impacts to
27 California's electrical supply.
28 //l

I| R6900-1017\2462864v4.doc -7-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

22. The OTC Policy initially required AES Redondo Beach and other coastal
2 power plants to effectively eliminate their once-through-cooling systems, or take other

4 measures to achieve compliance, by December 31, 2020.
23. Petitioners have long awaited the final compliance deadline when the AES

7 Redondo Beach power plant would cease emitting harmful air pollutants through its black,

8 billowing smoke which contaminates the surrounding environment and adversely affects

9 the health and well-being of residents, employees, and visitors in Redondo Beach and
Hermosa Beach.

24. The OTC Policy Amendment considered and ultimately adopted by the Water

ATTORNEYS AT LAW - A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATIO RICHARDS WATSON GERSH 10 Board on September 1, 2020, extended the current OTC Policy compliance deadline of
11 December 31, 2020 for three years until December 31, 2023 for three coastal power plants,
12 as follows: the Alamitos Generating Station, the Huntington Beach Generating Station, and
13 the Ormond Beach Generating Station. The December 31, 2020 compliance deadline was
14 extended for one year until December 31, 2021 for AES Redondo Beach.
15

16 Purported Environmental Review

25. The California Natural Resources Agency approved the Water Board's water
17 quality control planning process as a certified regulatory program that adequately satisfies
18 CEQA requirements for preparing environmental documents, pursuant to 23 C.C.R. section
19 3777. Consequently, a substitute environmental document ("SED") was used in place of an
20 environmental impact report as the required environmental documentation for the original
21 OTC Policy, and a Final SED was adopted on May 4, 2010.
22 26. While claiming that the OTC Policy Amendment does not constitute a project
23 under CEQA, the Water Board nonetheless purported to rely on an Addendum to the Final
24 SED as the environmental review for the OTC Policy Amendment.
25 27. The Addendum was contained in the Water Board staff report prepared for
26 the September 1, 2020 public hearing and included only one paragraph of purported
27 analysis of the impacts of the OTC Policy Amendment.
28  ///

I R6900-10172462864v4.doc -8-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

28. The Water Board Resolution approving the OTC Policy Amendment did not
2 include any finding that the Water Board exercised its independent judgment in considering
3 the Addendum.

4 29. The Water Board did not expressly approve or adopt the Addendum in its
Resolution but appeared only to implicitly rely on it as its CEQA compliance.

6 COMPLIANCE WITH PREREQUISITES

7 30. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to the filing of
8 this lawsuit, and have fully exhausted their administrative remedies by participating in the
9 Water Board's administrative processes related to the OTC Policy Amendment and the
10 Water Board's purported Addendum, to the extent that those processes were available,

ATTORNEYS AT LAW - A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION NOHSH30 NOSIVMSGHVHOIH 11 including Redondo Beach's submittal of letters to the Water Board on April 16, 2020 and
12 on May 18, 2020, and testimony at an April 21, 2020 workshop and at the September 1,
13 2020 Water Board hearing, and Hermosa Beach's submittal of letters on April 16, 2020 and
14 May 11, 2020.

15 31. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law unless the Court
16 grants the requested relief. In the absence of the requested relief, the Water Board's
17 amendment to the OTC Policy will result in AES Redondo Beach continuing to pollute the
18 air and cause water quality impacts for at least another year.

19 32. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 and,
20 prior to filing this lawsuit, have served upon the Water Board notices of their intent to file
21 this lawsuit. Copies of those notices are attached collectively as Exhibit A.

22 33. This lawsuit has been commenced within any applicable time limits as set
23 forth in the California Code of Civil Procedure and California Public Resources Code.

24 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

25 (Failure to Comply with the California Environmental Quality Act)
26 (Writ of Mandate [C.C.P. § 1085] against Respondent Water Board)
27 34. Petitioners incorporate by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1 through
28 33 as though fully set forth herein

-9-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

I R6900-10172462864v4.doc

1 35.

2 The Water Board is required to conduct adequate environmental review prior
to making any formal decision regarding projects subject to CEQA, including the OTP
3 Policy Amendment. CEQA imposes upon the Water Board a clear, present, and

4

5 mandatory duty to adequately analyze and mitigate adverse environmental impacts
resulting from the OTC Policy Amendment and the extension of time for compliance by
6 power plants such as AES Redondo Beach.
36.

8 The Water Board violated CEQA by failing to recognize the OTC Policy
Amendment as a project subject to CEQA, instead stating in its Resolution, without any
support, that "[t]he changes in compliance dates do not constitute a project within the
10 meaning of CEQA."

RICHARDS WATSON GERSHON ATTORNEYS AT LAW - A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATIO 11 37.

12 The OTC Policy Amendment meets the definition of a project under CEQA

13 (CEQA Guidelines § 15378) because it is an activity directly undertaken by a public
agency that has a potential for resulting in a direct physical change in the environment or a
14 reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment.
15 38. Notwithstanding the Water Board's statement in its Resolution, the Water
16 Board nonetheless purported to prepare an Addendum under CEQA (CEQA Guidelines

17 § 15164) to the Final SED as the environmental review for the OTC Policy Amendment,
18 thereby implicitly treating the OTC Policy Amendment as a project to some extent.

19 39.

20 CEQA provides that an Addendum to a previously certified environmental

21 document may be used only where some changes or additions are necessary to the prior

22 environmental document but none of the conditions set forth in CEQA Guidelines $ 15162

have been met.

23 40.

24 CEQA Guidelines section 15162 provides that a subsequent environmental

25 document must be prepared when:

26 (1) Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major

27 revisions of the previous [environmental document] due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity a of previously identified significant effects;

28 (2) Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is undertaken which will require major revisions of the previous [environmental document] due to the involvement of new significant -10-

R6900-10172462864v4.doc PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

p environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously
2 identified significant effects; or

3 (3) New information of substantial importance, which was not known and could not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the previous [environmental document was certified or adopted], shows 4 any of the following:
5 (A) The project will have one or more significant effects not discussed
wO in the previous [environmental document];

7 (B) Significant effects previously examined will be substantially more severe than shown in the previous [environmental document];

8 (C) Mitigation measures or alternatives previously found not to be feasible would in fact be feasible and would substantially reduce one or more significant effects of the project, but the project proponents
10 decline to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative; or

11 (D) Mitigation measures or alternatives which are considerably different from those analyzed in the previous [environmental OHSHED NOSIVMSGHVHOIH ATTORNEYS AT LAW - A PROFESSIONAL CORPORAT 12 document] would substantially reduce one or more significant effects on the environment, but the project proponents decline to adopt the
13 mitigation measure or alternative.

14 41. Here, substantial changes with respect to the circumstances under which the

15 project (the OTC Policy Amendment) is undertaken have occurred since the Final SED
16 was adopted, and new information of substantial importance, which was not known and

17 could not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the

18 previous Final SED was adopted, shows that the OTC Policy Amendment will have
19 impacts not previously analyzed, more significant than previously analyzed, and that new
20| and different mitigation measures would substantially reduce significant effects on the
21 environment.

22 42. For example, the Final SED states: "State Water Board staff cannot
23 accurately assess air quality impacts related to criteria pollutants because it is difficult to
24 estimate the method of compliance for each facility." Yet, at the time of the September 1,

25 2020 meeting, the Water Board had more than 10 years' worth of data to consider since it

26 adopted the Final SED in 2010. New evidence about air quality impacts from the OTC
27 facilities, which was not known in 2010, reveals previously unanalyzed environmental
28 impacts that were required to be evaluated.

-11-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
| R6900-10172462864v4.doc

43.

2 Furthermore, greenhouse gas emissions ("GHGs") resulting directly from the

3 continued operation of the power plants have not been analyzed or disclosed. California's

4 clear statutory mandates require the reduction of GHGs now and on a go-forward basis;

5 the Water Board not only has failed to demonstrate how the OTC Policy Amendment

6 complies with these obligations, it failed to conduct any analysis of the issue at all, in
violation of CEQA.

7 44.

8 The Water Board also failed to analyze and disclose other changes in
conditions at the AES Redondo Beach site since 2010, including but not limited to the
9| determination that approximately 5.93 acres of jurisdictional wetlands exists at the site and

10

RICHARDS WATSON GERSHON ATTORNEYS AT LAW - A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 11 serves as habitat for wildlife. In fact, on May 26, 2020, the California Coastal

12 Commission issued a Notice of Violation to AES Redondo Beach for violations of the

13 California Coastal Act (Pub. Resources Code § 30000, et seq.) and the Redondo Beach

14 Local Coastal Program. The Notice of Violation identified the following violations:
"Unpermitted development including but not limited to the unpermitted installation and
15 operation of water pumps for the purpose of groundwater dewatering affecting
16 approximately 5.93 acres of wetlands at the former tank portion of the site; unpermitted
17 installation and operation of water pumps in the vault area."

18 45.

19 In short, the Water Board failed to consider new information and substantial
evidence showing that there are significant environmental impacts resulting from the
20 extended operation of these power plants beyond their anticipated compliance date, and

21

22 more effective mitigation measures to reduce such environmental impacts.
46.

23 a As a result, more marine life will be killed and harmful air pollution emitted

24 into the densely populated South Bay communities of Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach,

25 and other surrounding cities.

47.

26 In addition to its failure to comply with CEQA by not properly analyzing,

27 disclosing, and mitigating impacts resulting from the OTC Policy Amendment, the Water

28 Board violated CEQA by failing to adopt a finding (including as required by CEQA
Guidelines section 15090) stating that the Addendum reflected the Water Board's

-12-

I R6900-10172462864v4.doc PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 independent judgment.

2 48.

3 The Water Board further violated CEQA by failing to approve or adopt the

4 Addendum at all, thus adopting the OTC Policy Amendment without any CEQA review.

5 Instead, the Water Board's Resolution stated only that "Consistent with CEQA, the State

6 Water Board finds the Staff Report [which contained the Addendum] does not engage in

7 speculation, but rather analyzes the project and the alternatives to the project, and

8 concludes that the project will not result in any additional environmental impacts." The

9 Water Board did not formally adopt or approve
49. the Addendum.

10 As a result of all of the foregoing, the Water Board has violated its duties

RICHARDS WATSON GERSHON ATTORNEYS AT LAW - A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATIO! 11 under law, engaged in prejudicial abuse of discretion, failed to proceed in the manner

12 required by law, and decided the matters complained of without the support of any
substantial evidence.

14 Petitioners have incurred attorneys' fees in preparing and filing this lawsuit

15 and will incur attorneys' fees in an amount not yet known in prosecuting this lawsuit and
this cause of action.
