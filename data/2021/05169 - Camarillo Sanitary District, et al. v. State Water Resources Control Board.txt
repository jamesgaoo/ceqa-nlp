21 I. INTRODUCTION

22 1. Petitioners/Plaintiffs Camarillo Sanitary District, City of Simi Valley, City of
23 Thousand Oaks, the Central Valley Clean Water Association (*CVCWA"), and the Southern
24 California Alliance of Publicly Owned Treatment Works ("SCAP) respectfully petition this Court
25 for a peremptory writ of mandamus pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP*)
26 section 1085 to set aside, void, annul, and terminate the implementation and enforcement of
27 certain newly adopted regulations known as the Toxicity Provisions (hereinafter "Provisions"),
28  which seek to regulate Whole Effluent Toxicity or "WET." WET is a term used to describe the
1682440v1
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 aggregate toxic effect of an aqueous sample (e.g., whole wastewater discharge) as measured by
2 how laboratory organisms (fish, algae, or invertebrate) respond upon prolonged exposure to the
3 sample. (40 C.F.R. §122.2.)

4 2. Respondent/Defendant STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD
5 ("State Board") adopted the Provisions on December 1, 2020, in a manner contrary to federal and
6 state law and based on findings and conclusions not supported by evidence in the administrative
7 record. The State Board also failed to fully comply with its obligations under the California
8| Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") and the Administrative Procedure Act ("APA") prior to

9 adopting the Provisions and, therefore, abused its discretion. (Public Resources ("Pub. Res.")
10 Code, §§ 21000, et seq; Cal. Government ("Gov.) Code, §§ 11340, et seq.) As of the filing date of
11 this Petition, the State Board's website stated that the "Final Resolution, Toxicity Provisions, and

JTI INVHI AHNMOI 12 Staff Report documents will be posted soon." Therefore, these documents are not provided as
13 exhibits hereto.

14 3. Petitioners/Plaintiffs also seek declaratory relief under CCP section 1060 and
15 Government Code section 11350 to determine the validity of the Provisions, and the sufficiency of
16 the process the State Board followed when adopting the Provisions. Specifically, Petitioners/
17 Plaintiffs request that this court determine and declare that the Provisions are invalid due to their
18 inconsistency with the authorizing statutes, the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq.) and
19 the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act ("Porter-Cologne") (California Water ("Wat.")
20 Code, §8 13000 et seq.), and due to the State Board's substantial failure to comply with applicable
21 provisions of the California APA and the APA's implementing regulations, and due to the State
22 Board's lack of full compliance with applicable requirements of CEQA.

23 4. Finally, Petitioners/Plaintiffs respectfully request that this Court immediately stay
24 and enjoin the implementation and enforcement of the Provisions prior to its effective date, and
25 maintain that injunction during the pendency of this challenge to ensure the status quo is preserved
26 until a final ruling is made. Imminent damage and irreparable harm will likely result from
27 allowing implementation and enforcement of the Provisions during judicial review. In addition,
28 significant cost and resources will be expended towards compliance with legally deficient rule
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RBLIEF

that will subject Petitioners and others to unwarranted enforcement, including citizen suits under
2 the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. § 1365), as well § as civil and criminal penalties, and potentially
3 imprisonment. (33 U.S.C. § 1319; Wat. Code, §§13385, 13387.)

4 II. PARTIES

5 5.

6 Petitioner/Plaintiff Camarillo Sanitary District is a special district formed in a 1955
to provide wastewater treatment to the City of Camarillo. Since the inception of the district, its
7 treated wastewater has been used to irrigate adjacent farmlands. Last year, approximately 289
8 million gallons of wastewater were reclaimed for irrigation. Any treated effluent not reclaimed is
9 discharged into Conejo Creek and is subject to permit requirements under the Clean Water Act
10 and state law, and will be subject to the Provisions.

11 6.

DOWNEY BRAND LLP Petitioners/Plaintiffs Cities of Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks are cities organized
12 under the laws of the State of California and located in Ventura County, California. Each of these
13 cities owns and operates wastewater treatment plants that both recycle water and discharge excess
14 treated water under permit requirements under the Clean Water Act and state law that will be
15 subject to the Provisions.

16 7. Petitioner/Plaintiff SCAP is a non-profit corporation and Petitioner/Plaintiff
17 CVCWA is a non-profit industry trade association. Both CVCWA and SCAP represent
18 municipalities and other public entities located within the Central Valley region and southern
19 California, respectively, that perform the critical public services of providing wastewater
20 collection, treatment, and water recycling services to millions of residents and businesses. SCAP

21 was organized to help ensure that regulations affecting wastewater treatment plants, known as
22 Publicly Owned Treatment Works ("POTWs," defined at 40 C.F.R. 403.3), are reasonable, lawful,
23 and in the public's best interest. SCAP and CVCWA act to represent and advocate for the
24 interests of their respective members on issues of importance where, as here, State agencies veer
25 from the requirements set forth in laws and regulations, and participate in litigation where, as here,
26 topics of import to their membership are raised. CVCWA's and SCAP's members treat and
27 recycle domestic, commercial, and industrial wastewater, which in many cases, is of such high
28 quality that the water meets or is cleaner than drinking water standards. Nevertheless, any of this
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 high quality water discharged to surface waters will be subject to the Provisions.

2 8. Respondent/Defendant State Board is a California administrative agency charged
3 with formulating and adopting state policy for water quality control within the State of California.
4 (Wat. Code, § 13140.) The State Board is authorized to administer the California Water Code, and

5 has delegated authority from the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") to

6 administer the state's water quality program consistent with the Clean Water Act. In addition, the
7 State Board is a "public agency" for purposes of CEQA. (Pub. Res. Code § 21063.)

8 III. PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

9 9. Petitioners/Plaintiffs bring this action acting as private attorneys general pursuant to
10 Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important
11 rights affecting the public interest.

d'TT ONVHE AHNMOI 12 10. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition/Complaint will confer a significant
13 benefit on a large class of persons within the state by virtue of the Provisions modification of
14 regulations and Basin Plans in all regions.

15 11. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition/Complaint will confer a significant
16 benefit on the general public by requiring the State Board, and its appointed officials, to
17 comply with the applicable provisions of the Clean Water Act, Porter-Cologne, the APA and CEQA.

18 12. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make an award of
19| attorneys' fees appropriate in this proceeding. The financial burden to Petitioners/Plaintiffs was great:
20 Petitioners/Plaintiffs drafted and submitted numerous written comments either directly or by counsel,
21 attended numerous State Board meetings and staff workshops, met and coordinated testimony with
22 other interested parties, and spent considerable time considering, preparing, and filing this litigation.
23 Enforcement was necessary to ensure that various public agencies, businesses, and citizens are not
24 required to comply with invalid and unlawful regulations and attorneys' fees are therefore
25 warranted.

26 IV. STANDING, JURISDICTION, EXHAUSTION, TIMELINESS, AND VENUE
27 13. With this Petition, Petitioners/Plaintiffs, as aggrieved parties, are challenging the
28 actions taken by the State Board that were contrary to state and federal law, and the failures of the
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- State Board to act lawfully in establishing and approving the Provisions. The actions taken and
2 the failures to lawfully act by the State Board were improper, unreasonable, arbitrary and
3 capricious, and in violation of state and federal law. Petitioners have standing as they and/or their
4 members will be adversely impacted by the Provisions' new and expensive water quality
5 regulation, if not overturned. This harm will occur due to new costlier permit and monitoring
6 requirements, potential enforcement actions related to monitoring results and violations of new
7 effluent limitations, and potentially other adverse impacts. The State Board's failure to adequately

8 consider or implement viable alternatives and acknowledge and mitigate potentially significant
9 environmental impacts also violates CEQA and the APA.

10 14. Petitioners/Plaintiffs have standing to assert the claims raised herein individually
11 or as an interested entity (Gov. Code, § 11350(a)), which has members that will be severely and
d'TIINVHI AHNMOC 12 adversely impacted by the Provisions, if implemented in the current form.
13 15. Petitioners/Plaintiffs have no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the
14 ordinary course of law. (CCP, § 1086.) Thus, directly and promptly proceeding to judicial review
15 of the issues raised herein following the State Board's adoption and approval of the Provisions is
16 appropriate.

17 16. This Court has jurisdiction over this case pursuant to, inter alia, CCP section 1085,
18 Government Code section 11350, and Public Resources Code section 21167.

19 17. Petitioners/Plaintiffs exhausted all available administrative remedies by
20 participating extensively, either directly or through representatives, during the administrative
21 public review process and stakeholder meetings for the Provisions. Petitioners/Plaintiffs and
22 others presented the alleged grounds for non-compliance with federal and state laws, including the
23 Clean Water Act, Porter-Cologne, APA, and CEQA, to the State Board orally or in writing during
24 the public comment periods provided, and before the close of the public hearing on the Provisions
25 in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21177(a).
26 18. Petitioners/Plaintiffs are timely filing this CCP section 1085 claim related to the
27 validity of the Provisions. No specific statute of limitation has been prescribed by the Legislature
28 for challenges to regulations proposed by the State Board under CCP section 1085 and, therefore,
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 the general four (4) year statute of limitations in CCP section 343 is applicable. This action is also
2 timely under CEQA because filed within thirty (30) days after the State Board's adoption of the
3 Provisions. (Pub. Res. Code, § 21167.)

4 19, For declaratory relief under CCP section 1060 and Government Code section
5 11350 and for injunctive relief, no specific statute of limitation has been prescribed by the

6 Legislature. Petitioners/Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief regarding the validity of the Provisions,

7 and the sufficiency of the process the State Board followed when adopting the Provisions.
8 Petitioners/Plaintiffs also seek injunctive relief, halting implementation of the Provisions during
9 this legal challenge.

10 20. On December 29, 2020, as required by CEQA, Petitioners served written notice of

11 the commencement of this action pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5 before

dTT ANVAE AHNMOI 12 commencement of this action. In this notice, Petitioners/Plaintiffs' counsel also requested the State
13 Board to prepare the administrative record in accordance with the requirements of Public
14 Resources Code section 21167.6(b) and (e) and Government Code section 11523. A true and
15 correct copy of that Notice of Commencement of Action/Request to Prepare Record under CEQA
16 is attached as Exhibit A hereto. Petitioners also provided the California Attorney General's office
17 with a copy of this Petition, pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and CCP section
18 388, as shown in the proof of service by mail and email for this Petition.

19 21. Venue is proper in Fresno County pursuant to CCP section 401(1) because the
20 Attorney General maintains an office in that location.

21 22. Unless the requested relief is granted, the State Board will proceed with
22 implementation of the Provisions in violation of and in excess of its authority under the federal
23 Clean Water Act, Porter-Cologne, CEQA, the APA, and other state and federal laws and
24 regulations.

25 V. LEGAL BACKGROUND

26 A. State Water Quality Law

27 23. Porter-Cologne represents California's principal water quality law. First adopted in
28 1969, Porter-Cologne has been amended occasionally, and is found in the California Water Code, 0
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 sections 13000 et seq. Under the Porter-Cologne, primary responsibility for the coordination and
2 control of water quality is split between the State Board and nine regional water quality control
3 boards. (California Building Industry Assn. V. State Water Resources Control Bd. (2018) 4 Cal.5th
4 1032, 1037, citing Wat. Code, §13001.)

5 24. Water Code section 13000 provides that the quality of the waters of the State of
6 California are to be regulated to attain the highest water quality, which is reasonable, considering

7

8 all demands being made and to be made of those waters and the total values involved, beneficial

9 and detrimental, economic and social, tangible and intangible. (Wat. Code, §13000.)
25. Water Code section 13140 requires that state policy for water quality control "shall
10 be adopted in accordance with the provisions of this article and shall be in conformity with the

DOWNEY BRAND LLP 11 policies set forth in Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 13000)." (Wat. Code, §13140 (emphasis
12 added).) Thus, Water Code section 13000's requirement for reasonable water quality regulation is
13 transformed by Water Code section 13140 into a mandatory duty.
14 26. Unlike water quality policies, water quality control plans ("WQCPs") are primarily
15 within the regional boards' jurisdiction. (See United States v. State Water Resources Control Bd.
16 (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 82,109.) The State Board must approve WQCPs adopted by regional
17 boards, but the State Board adopts its own WQCPs only in enumerated circumstances.
18 27. Specifically, the State Board may adopt water quality control plans, but only "for
19 waters for which water quality standards are required by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
20 [fn 33 U.S.C.A. §1251 et seq.] and acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto." (Wat.
21 Code, §13170 (emphasis added).) Water quality control plans must include three (3) distinct
22 parts: (1) beneficial uses to be protected; (2) water quality objectives, and (3) a program of
23 implementation needed for achieving the water quality objectives. (Wat. Code, §13050(j).)
24 28. As part of the development and implementation of WQCPs, both state and federal
25 law require consideration of specific factors in formulating appropriate water quality objectives.
26 (Wat. Code, §§ 13241, 13170; 40 C.F.R. §§131.5(a)(6), 131.6(e).) These factors include:
27

28 (a) Past, present, and probable future beneficial uses of water;
(b) Environmental characteristics of the hydrographic unit under consideration,
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 including the quality of water available thereto.

2

3 (c) Water quality conditions that could reasonably be achieved through the coordinated

area.

4 control of all factors which affect water quality in the
(d) Economic considerations.

5 (e) The need for developing housing within the region.

6

7 29. (f) The need to develop and use recycled water. (Wat. Code, §13241(a)-(f).)
The required program of implementation for achieving water quality objectives in a
8 WQCP shall include, but not be limited to:

10 (a) A description of the nature of actions which are necessary to achieve the

11 objectives, including recommendations for appropriate action by any entity, public
or private.

DOWNEY BRAND LLP 12 (b) A time schedule for the actions to be taken.

13

14 (c) A description of surveillance to be undertaken to determine compliance with

15 30. objectives. (Wat. Code, §13242; see accord 40 C.F.R. §130.6(c)(6).)
Under State law, as part of the water quality planning process, the State Board (or
16 regional water quality control boards) may require investigations and reports related to water
17 quality provided that the burden, including costs of such reports, bears a reasonable relationship to
18 the need for the report and the enefits to be obtained therefrom. (Wat. Code, §13165; see also
19 Wat. Code, §§ 13225(c) and 13267(b).)
20 31. Chapter 5.5 of the Water Code, is entitled "Compliance with the Provisions of the
21 Federal Water Pollution Control Act as Amended in 1972" and requires that this chapter "be
22 construed to ensure consistency with the requirements for state programs implementing the
23 Federal Water Pollution Control Act and acts amendatory thereof and supplementary thereto."
24 (Cal. Wat. Code § 13372 (emphasis added).)

25 32. California is authorized to administer certain aspects of the Clean Water Act and its
26 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") discharge permit program under
27 delegated authority from the EPA and pursuant to a Memorandum of Understanding by and
28 between EPA and the State Board, effective September 22, 1989. (Wat. Code, §13160.)
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 B. Federal Water Quality Law

2 33. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act or Clean

3 Water Act ("CWA"), adopted
originally by Congress in 1972, has been amended several times. For waters of the United States,
4 the Clean Water Act requires states to adopt water quality standards, which consist of a designated

5

6 use of the water and water quality criteria to protect that use, and an implementation plans to meet
those standards. (33 U.S.C. § 1313(c) and (e).) Water quality criteria may be narrative ("no toxics
7 in toxic amounts") or numeric (10 milligrams per liter). "Water quality standards" typically
8 consist of two complementary parts: numerical limits on the allowable concentration of particular

9 pollutants in ambient water (e.g., 'no more mercury than 5 parts per billion'), and a descriptive,
10| 'narrative' criterion regarding the entire effluent (e.g., 'no toxic pollutants in toxic amounts').

DOWNEY BRAND LLP 11 (See 33 U.S.C. 1251(a)(3).) WET tests are used to measure compliance with standards of the
12 latter type." (Edison Elec. Institute v. E.P.A ("Edison Elec. ') 391 F.3d 1267, 1268 (D.C. Cir.
13 2004).)

14 34. Numeric criteria are only required for specific toxic pollutants listed pursuant to
15 CWA section 1317(a). (33 U.S.C. § 1313(c)(2)(B).) Where numerical criteria are not available
16 (such as is the case for whole effluent toxicity), states must adopt criteria based on biological
17 monitoring or assessment methods consistent with information published pursuant to Clean Water
18| Act section 1314(a)(8). (Id.)

19 35. To ensure all permit holders use similar test methods and meet equal protection
20 requirements to have similar compliance determinations, Clean Water Act section 1314 requires
21 EPA to develop and publish methods for establishing and measuring water quality criteria for
22 toxic pollutants, including monitoring and assessment methods (33 U.S.C. § 1314(a)(8)); to
23 promulgate guidelines establishing test procedures for the analysis of pollutants (33 U.S.C. §
24  1314(h)); and to promulgate guidelines establishing the procedural and other elements of a state
25

26

27 Water quality criteria under federal law are called "water quality objectives" under state law.

28 (Wat. Code, § 13050(h).) Water quality objectives are "the limits or levels of water quality constituents or characteristics which are established for the reasonable protection of beneficial uses of water or the prevention of nuisance within a specific area." (Id.) 9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 water quality control program, including monitoring and reporting requirements (33 U.S.C. §
2 1314(i)(A) and (B).)

3 36. Within the NPDES program, acutc and chronic toxicity tests are used to measure
4  treated wastewater in conjunction with other chemical analyses to evaluate and assess the

5 compliance of wastewater discharges and surface waters with applicable water quality standards
approved under the CWA. (See generally 33 U.S.C. §1313; 40 C.F.R. §122.48.) Acute toxicity is
related to short term lethality or death of the organisms, while chronic toxicity refers to longer
8  term lethal and sub-lethal effects on critical life stages, such as limitations in larval growth or
9 reduced reproduction. (See USEPA Terms and Acronyms, Acute Toxicity, Terminology Services,
10 https://iaspub.epa.gov/sorinternet/registry/termreg/scarchandretrieve/termsandacronyms/searc
11 0 (site last accessed Dec. 28, 2020); USEPA Terms and Acronyms, Chronic Toxicity,
LLP ONVHE AENMOC 12 https://iaspub.epa.gov/sor_internet/registry/termreg/searchandretrieve/termsandacronyms/search.d
13 o (site last accessed Dec. 28, 2020.) A single chronic toxicity test takes up to nine (9) days to
14 conduct. (See Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for the Analysis of Pollutants; Whole
15 Effluent Toxicity Test Methods; Final Rule, 67 Fed. Reg. 69,952, 69,953 (Nov. 19, 2002).)
16 37. WET tests are designed to replicate the environmental exposure of aquatic life to
17 toxic pollutants in an effluent without initially requiring the identification of the specific toxicants
18 that may be causing toxicity. WET is not an identifiable "pollutant," but is deemed a method-
19 defined analyte.2 Thus, more in-depth analyses, known as Toxicity Identification Evaluations
20 ("TIEs") and Toxicity Reduction Evaluations (*TREs") are performed when toxicity is indicated
21 to determine what pollutants may be the likely cause of the toxic effect. (See accord 67 Fed. Reg.
22 at 69,968 ("EPA policy suggests additional testing is an appropriate initial response to a single
23 WET limit exceedance.").)
24 38. Unlike chemical tests, "the use of living specimens introduces a significant a
25 potential for variability between and within tests." (Edison Elec. at 1269.) Because these tests are
26

27 "[U]nlike properties such as chemical concentration, toxicity is both measured and defined by 28 the WET tests (i.e., it is a 'method-defined analyte')." (Edison Electric at 1270.) 10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 performed on unique living organisms, results may not indicate toxicity at all, but merely effects

2 from changes in temperature or other environmental stimuli, from natural population differences,

3 or from mere happenstance. "EPA sought to minimize the effect of organic idiosyncracy by
4 taking experimental and statistical precautions." (Edison Electric at 1269.)

5 39. EPA's first WET test methods were promulgated in 1995. (60 Fed. Reg. 53,529
6 (Oct. 16, 1995).) After a legal challenge to this rule, these WET methods were modified in 2002
7 pursuant to a settlement requiring EPA to re-promulgate chronic WET test methods for use in

8 monitoring compliance with NPDES permit limitations after a formal national rulemaking

9 process, in accordance with 40 C.F.R. Part 136. (67 Fed. Reg. at 69,954.) These "2002 Methods,"
10 contained in 40 C.F.R. Part 136 and method manuals incorporated therein by reference,
11 specifically included two approved test methodologies, a hypothesis test based on the No

d'TI INVIE AHNMOI 12 Observed Effect Concentration ("NOEC")/Lowest Observable Effect Concentration ("LOEC")
13 and a point estimate test based on the 25% Inhibition Concentration ("IC25").

14 40. The 2002 Methods constitute EPA's promulgated Part 136 WET methods and must
15 be used when an NPDES permit requires WET testing.3 Federal rules implementing the Clean
16 Water Act mandate the use of test procedures (i.e., methods) approved under Part 136 for
17 monitoring and reporting in NPDES permit compliance context. (See 40 C.F.R. §§122.44(i)(1)(iv)
18 and 122.41(j)(4).)

19 41. As set forth in section 122.44(i)(1)(iv)(B) of the federal regulations, one can only
20 use non-Part 136 methods where no approved Part 136 methods exist. That is not the case for
21 chronic toxicity - Part 136 contains two approved options as discussed above. The 2002 Methods
22 allow specified hypothesis testing with a null hypothesis that presumes an effluent sample is non-
23 toxic, and requires testing to determine compliance using a control group and a minimum of five
24 effluent concentrations to evaluate the validity of the dose-response relationship.

25

26 The 2002 Methods were judicially challenged, but were upheld in 2004 in the Edison Electric case. The Edison Electric court recognized the inherent problems with WET testing and cautioned
27 that "[e]ven by EPA's calculations, WET tests will be wrong some of the time, which is why EPA warned against using a single test result to institute an action for a civil penalty." (Edison Electric
28 at 1272 citing 67 Fed. Reg. at 69,968 (emphasis added).)
II
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

42. The Clean Water Act requires all information "on the measurement and
classification of water quality" to be promulgated and "published in the Federal Register." (33
U.S.C. §§1314(a)(2), (3), and 1314(h), (i)(A), (B)(Applicable to "sources of discharge subject to

4 any state program under section 1342" (NPDES program).)
C. California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
43. Under CEQA, governmental agencies at all levels are required to "consider
qualitative factors as well as economic and technical factors and long-term benefits and costs, in
proposed actions affecting 8 addition to short-term benefits and costs and to consider alternatives to

9 the environment." (Pub. Res. Code §21001(g).) State public agencies should not approve
10| proposed projects if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available that
11 avoid or substantially lessen potentially significant effects. (Pub. Res. Code §21002.) "Feasible"
d'TI ONVIE AHNMOI 12 means capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time,
13 taking into account economic, environmental, social, and technological factors. (Pub. Res. Code
14 §21061.1.)

15 44. CEQA requires that public agencies involved in the environmental review process
16 be responsible for carrying out the process in the most efficient, expeditious manner in order to
17 conserve the available financial, governmental, physical, and social resources with the objective
18 that those resources may be better applied toward the mitigation of actual significant effects on the
19 environment. (Pub. Res. Code $21003(f).) In mitigating or avoiding a significant effect of a
20 project on the environment, a public agency may exercise only those express or implied powers
21 provided by law other than CEQA. (Pub. Res. Code §21004.)
22 45. Under Title 14 of the Code of California Regulations ("CCR") sections 3775-3782,
23 Basin Plan Amendments are considered "certified programs" under the CEQA guidelines and
24  must satisfy the requirements of CEQA as a "functional equivalent" analysis conducted in a
25 Supplemental Environmental Document ("SED"). Thus, under a certified regulatory program, the
26 State Board was required to conduct an analysis of the environmental impacts and effects,
27 adequately complete an "environmental checklist," provide a description of the proposed activity,
28 reasonable alternatives, and mitigation measures,to minimize any significant adverse impacts. (14 12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 CCR §$15250, 15252.) The State Board's environmental checklist, required prior to the adoption
2 of plans or policies for the Basin/208 Planning program as certified by the Secretary for Natural
Resources, becomes part of the SED. (14 CCR §3775 et seq, at Appendix A [Environmental
4 Checklist Form].)

46. For each environmental category in the checklist, the State Board must determine
whether the project will cause any adverse impact. If there are potential impacts not included in
the sample checklist, those impacts should be added to the checklist. The State Board may
8 determine the significance of the impact by considering factual evidence, agency standards, or
9 thresholds. If the "No Impact" box is checked, the board should briefly provide the basis for that
10 answer. (Id. at Appendix A [Environmental Checklist Form].)
11 47. If there are one or more "Potentially Significant Impact" entries on the checklist,
LLP ONVYE AINMOC 12 the SED must include an examination of feasible alternatives and mitigation measures for each
13 such impact, similar to the requirements for preparing an environmental impact report. (Id. at
14 Appendix A [Environmental Checklist Form].) The State Board should provide references used to
15 identify potential impacts, including a list of information sources and individuals contacted. (Ibid.)
16 48. The State Board "shall not adopt or approve a project that would cause significant
mitigation measures available that 17 adverse impacts if there are feasible alternatives or feasible
18 would substantially lessen any significant adverse impact that the project may have on the
19 environment." (14 CCR §3780(a).)
20 D. Administrative Procedure Act (APA)
21 49. The APA (Gov. Code, §§11340 et seq.) was adopted to avoid unnecessarily
22 prescriptive regulations that do not meet the prescribed standards. In fact, the APA recognizes
23 that "[t]he imposition of prescriptive standards upon private persons and entities through
24 regulations where the establishment of performance standards could reasonably be expected to
25 produce the same result has placed an unnecessary burden on California citizens and discouraged
26 innovation, research, and development of improved means of achieving desirable social goals."
27 (Gov. Code, §11340(d).) The Provisions fall squarely into the realm of overly and unnecessarily
28 "prescriptive standards." 13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

50. The APA further states: "It is the intent of the Legislature that agencies shall

2 actively seek to reduce the unnecessary regulatory burden on private individuals and entities by
3 substituting performance standards for prescriptive standards wherever performance standards can

4 be reasonably expected to be as effective and less burdensome, and that this substitution shall be
5 considered during the course of the agency rulemaking process.' (Gov. Code, §11340.1(a).)
6 Although Petitioners/Plaintiffs continually suggested ways to substitute performance standards for
7 prescriptive standards, such as narrative objectives and permit limits along with numeric triggers

8 into further investigation if exceeded instead of numeric objectives and pass/fail limits, the State

9 Board ignored these less burdensome and equally effective options.

10 51. The APA requires that State rules require a showing of "necessity," "authority,"
11 | "clarity,' ° "consistency." "reference," and "non-duplication." (See Gov. Code, §§11349.1(a),

dTI ANVUE AHNMOI 12 11353(b)(2)(C) and (b)(4).) Although Government Code section 11353 applies to Basin Plans and
13 amendments thereto, Section 11353 specifically requires compliance with Government Code
14 section 11349.1, along with several other APA provisions. (Gov. Code, §11353(b)(4).)

15 VI. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

16 A. History of Toxicity Provisions

17 52. Based on administrative appeals by SCAP members filed with respect to NPDES
18 permits issued in 2002 that included numeric effluent limitations for chronic toxicity, the State
19 Board issued two precedential rulings removing the numeric limits and replacing those limits with
20 narrative chronic toxicity limits and numeric triggers, which, if exceeded, required further
21 investigation into the issue. In those precedential orders (State Board Order Nos. WQO 2003-
22 0012 and WQO 2003-0013),4 the State Board also ordered its staff to initiate a rulemaking process
23 to address the issues on a statewide basis. a Until that time, the precedential orders were meant to
24 | dictate how to assess toxicity from and regulate POTW discharges in NPDES wastewater permits.
25 This permitting approach was confirmed in two later State Board orders (State Board Order Nos.

26

27 All State Board water quality orders are accessible at following website by year (last accessed 28 Dec. 30, 2020): https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/board_decisions/adopted_orders/water_quality/.) 14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

WQO 2008-0008 and WQO 2012-0001),4 and has been the prevailing permitting approach in

2 California since 2003.

53. Notwithstanding these binding orders, the State Board did not begin public review
of a new toxicity policy until the very end of 2005/early 2006, and the final Provisions were not
ultimately adopted until December 1, 2020. In the meantime, the State Board presented no
I demonstrated water quality problems associated with the previously prescribed permitting
7| approach. In addition, several regional water quality control boards began to issue NPDES

8 permits more consistent with the Provisions, before the Provisions were adopted and contrary to

9 the binding precedential orders, and permit holders including some of the Petitioners/Plaintiffs or
10 their member entities began to experience compliance issues not previously encountered. Most

11 permits containing TST-based permit requirements were appealed to the State Board, but those

JTT UNVHE AINMOG 12 administrative appeals were placed in abeyance, in hopes that the ultimate policy choices made in
13 the Provisions would moot the appeals. Instead, the Provisions seem to attempt to moot the
14 illegality of the previous permits adopted without valid authority.

15 54. By way of background, in 2005, the State Board issued a Notice of Public Scoping
16 Meeting related to proposed revisions to the Toxicity Control Provisions in the Policy for
17 Implementation of Toxics Standards for Inland Surface Waters, Enclosed Bays, and Estuaries of
18 California (also known as the State Implementation Policy or "SIP"). The noticed meeting was set

19 for January 17, 2006. The description of the project was as follows: "Revise and expand Toxicity
20 Control Provisions in the SIP to address existing implementation gaps and to clarify the

21 appropriate use of toxicity effluent limitations in NPDES permits." The project description did

22 not include many things ultimately included in the Provisions, including new water quality

23 objectives for toxicity or any discussion of the TST.

24 55. The first version of this rulemaking proposal was the 2010 Draft Policy for
25 Toxicity Assessment and Control ("Policy"), which set for a workshop on November 16, 2010 and
26 a comment period ending on November 22, 2010. On November 19, 2010, the State Board

27 extended the comment period, and cancelled the adoption hearing tentatively scheduled for
28 January 4, 2011. On July 27, 2011, the State Board set another staff workshop date of Monday,
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 August 22, 2011.

2 56. Another public draft of the Policy and updated staff report was issued on June 27,
3 2012, and a public hearing was held on August 21, 2012. No adoption hearing was held on this

4 version of the Policy.

5 57. In 2018, a new notice of opportunity for public comment, public staff workshops,
6 public hearing, and notice of filing was issued, not for the Policy previously scoped under CEQA
7 and proposed, but now the notice was related to a water quality control plan, the "proposed
8 Establishment of the Water Quality Control Plan for Inland Surface Waters, Enclosed Bays, and
9 Estuaries of California; and Toxicity Provisions (hereafter Toxicity Provisions) and the Draft Staff
10 Report, including the Draft Substitute Environmental Documentation, for the Toxicity Provisions
11 (hereafter Staff Report)." This notice set workshops in October of 2018 and a State Board hearing
d'IT UNVIE AHNMOC 12 for November 28, 2018.

13 58. After many more rounds of changes, the State Board ultimately adopted the
14 Provisions on December 1, 2020, over the objections of many stakeholders.
15 B. Toxicity Testing Background

16 59. A single WET test involves exposing multiple batches of organisms to the effluent
17 at various concentrations, as well as to a "control" sample of pure water, and then aggregating the
18 effects on each batch. (Edison Elec. at 1272-73.) Statistical analysis is then used to ensure that any
19 observed differences between the organisms exposed to various effluent concentration and those
20 exposed to the control blanks most likely are not attributable to randomness - that they are
21 statistically significant. (Id. citing 2002 Methods Final Rule, 67 Fed. Reg. at 69,957-58.) EPA's
22 ratified test methods "entail a built-in mechanism a that serves the same basic purpose as detection
23 limits in instrumental tests to reduce the likelihood that random 'noise' will result in a false
24 positive result," or indication of toxicity where none exists. (Id. at 1272.) These safeguards were
25 put in place to address concerns over inaccurate results, but have been eliminated using the TST
26 statistical approach that prescribes using only one effluent concentration and a control.
27 60. In the primary statewide toxicity assessment study performed by the State Board in
28 2011, the State Board found that water quality in harbors and bays in California were 100% non-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 toxic, yet the Provisions unnecessarily apply to bays and harbors without adequate justification.
2 (See Toxicity in California Waters, State Water Board (Oct. 2011), attached hereto as Exhibit B,

3 at p. 7.)

4 61. POTWs and other non-stormwater NPDES permittees were not identified as the
5 main or even predominant cause of any toxicity seen in California waters, which was determined

6

7 to be "caused by pesticides" related to urban runoff and agriculture and, in coastal receiving

8 waters, "due to zinc and copper" from stormwater (see Exhibit B at pp. 9 and 13 ), yet "NON-
STORM WATER NPDES DISCHARGERS" are the main focus of the Provisions without
9 adequate justification or supporting evidence. In addition, this 2011 study determined that "The
10 primary regulatory mechanism for reducing pesticide loading in urban and agriculture watersheds

DOWNEY BRAND LLP 11  in California is the development and implementation of a TMDL" (Exhibit B at p. 19), not
12 creating statewide Toxicity Provisions.5

13 62. This 2011 toxicity study also began the State Board's promotion of the TST
14| approach, even while recognizing that the TST declared sample toxic six percent (6%) more
15 often than the promulgated methods. (Exhibit B at p. 18.) The TST is clearly not comparable
16 when the results differ 8% of the time. (Id.)
17 63. The TST approach included in the Provisions fails to utilize the necessary dose-
18 response curve to ensure actual toxicity exists. This failure can place a permitted entity at risk of
19 non-compliance without adequate justification and provides an explanation why toxicity data can
20 show more TST failures than those under the other two promulgated methods. The TST approach
21 has been demonstrated to inaccurately identify non-toxic samples. When known "non-toxic"
22 method blank data from USEPA's Interlaboratory WET Variability Study is re-evaluated using the
23 TST, the number of false indications of "toxicity" or "false failures" increases dramatically.
24 Approximately 15% of all non-toxic samples would be declared "toxic" using the TST in the
25

26 The 2011 study also found that "[i]n addition to pesticide use restrictions, numerous state,

27 regional and local programs are intended to reduce urban and agricultural contaminant runoff through implementation of various management practices." Exhibit B at p. 20. No mention was made of a need for regulating non-stormwater NPDES permittees. (Id.) Thus, the Toxicity 28 Provisions attempt to create a "fix" for a non-existent problem, at high cost with little benefit. 17

13 64. The Southern California Coastal Water Research Project ("SCCWRP") recently
14 conducted a laboratory study where known non-toxic blank samples of water were tested using the

15 guidance TST statistical method. The results showed as high as a 50% false rate of toxicity for

16 the samples, where half showed up as "toxic" even though the samples were designed to be non-

17 toxic. In a strict liability permit scheme, this extraordinarily high level of false indications of

18 toxicity would place permit holders in position of non-compliance where no wrongdoing had

19 actually occurred and could subject permittees to mandatory and discretionary civil penalties,
20 potential criminal penalties, and unnecessary citizen enforcement for discharges of "toxic water."

21 (Wat. Code, §§13385, 13387; 33 U.S.C. §§1319, 1365.)

22 VII. PLAINTIFFS ARE ENTITLED TO INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

23 65. Plaintiffs seek an order to temporarily restrain and preliminarily enjoin the State

24 Board from enforcing the Provisions that, among other things, purportedly authorize and mandate
25 the two-concentration TST for water quality regulation, for permitting using maximum daily and

26 monthly median effluent limits, and compliance determination purposes, and contain other

27 unlawful provisions. Injunctive relief is necessary as permits will be issued requiring the use of
28 the null hypothesis, statistical method, and pass/fail, and percent effect effluent limitations set
18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 forth in the Provisions, which was adopted in the absence of an approved Part 136 method or even
2 a valid Alternative Test Procedure (ATP). The four-part test for assessing permanent injunctive
3 relief compels the conclusion that Plaintiffs are entitled to an injunction against the State Board.

4 66. First, Plaintiffs have suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm absent
5 injunctive relief, because Plaintiffs' members whose permits currently or will soon contain

6 requirements based on the TST will be subject to enforcement and potentially liable for civil and
7 criminal penalties and citizen suits for failure to consistently comply with the new final Pass/Fail
8 and percent effect effluent limits and for undertaking more frequent and costly toxicity testing
requirements.

10 67. Furthermore, the State Board's unlawful actions will cause Plaintiffs and Plaintiff's
11 members and other NPDES permit holders statewide to suffer harm through the increased risk of
d'TT UNVAE AINMOG 12 non-compliance, and the need to run additional tests, including more replicate tests, to attempt to
13 statistically demonstrate compliance. Once the Provisions are fully approved by the Office of
14 Administrative Law and EPA and begin to be implemented, the State Board's actions will cause
15 immediate and irreparable injury, economic loss in the form of additional testing required to attempt
16 to ensure compliance, and damage in the form of penalties and reputational injury for non-

17 compliance with permit requirements.

18 68. Some SCAP members and other permittees in the State have already received
19 NPDES permits with effluent limits requiring the use of TST to determine compliance. Many of
20 these permittees have seen and had to report toxicity violations for the first time, even where they
21  had perfect records in relation to WET requirements previously. As soon as the Provisions become
22 effective, additional POTWs and dischargers will face similar requirements without compliance
23 with the Clean Water Act. Other POTWs and dischargers, including additional SCAP members,
24 will be required to comply with the TST as new NPDES permits continue to be renewed throughout
25 the state.6 An injunction on the use of the Provisions and the requirements to include TST in NPDES
26 permits and maximum daily and monthly median effluent limitations in POTW permits should be
27
a fixed term not to exceed 5 6
28 See 40 C.F.R. §122.46(a)('NPDES permits shall be effective for years."). 19
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

granted because the federal regulations set forth legal pathways using other types of limits and other
2 fully vetted and formally promulgated WET methods contained in the Part 136 regulations that can
3 and should be used for appropriate and legal regulation of toxicity in permits.
69. Second, Plaintiffs have no remedy available at law against these unlawful
5 regulations, such as monetary damages, to compensate for the harms described above.

6 70. Third, the balance of hardships favor an injunction, because there will be no
7 substantial harm to the State Board or the environment. A permanent injunction will merely return
8 NPDES permit requirements and WET regulation to the status quo that existed for at least 17 years

9 before the Provisions were adopted, and will remain in place until final judgment in this matter,
10 which can hopefully be accomplished on an expedited basis.7

11 71. Finally, an injunction furthers the public interest by ensuring that the State Board
12 d'TT ONVAE AANMOG acts within the scope of the law and its statutory authority. The public is harmed whenever the
13 government is not required to comply with its own laws and regulations since the public does not
14 have the freedom to ignore legal mandates.

15 72. Just like all citizens, State agencies, including the State Board, must comply with the
16 laws, rules, and regulations that specify what actions are lawful and what actions are not. The failure
17 by State Board to adopt regulations that comply with the law ignores previous challenges and
18 settlements related to WET testing (see Edison Electric), and works great prejudice to the regulated
19 community, including Plaintiffs and Plaintiffs' members. For these reasons, injunctive relief is
20 appropriate and warranted.

21 VIII. STANDARD OF REVIEW

22 73. Petitioners seek the issuance of a writ of mandate under CCP section 1085 because
23 the challenged action by the State Board is quasi-legislative. Pursuant to CCP section 1085, and
24

25 An equitable remedy will maintain the status quo that has been in place for the last 17 years since 2003, and will maintain the current choice allowing use of either the NOEC or the IC25 methods 26 approved in the 2002 Methods. (See 40 C.F.R. §§136.1(a); 136.3(a), Table IA, n. 27.) Additionally, the regulatory oversight of the Petitioners/Plaintiffs' and SCAP and CVCWA members, and the 27 regulated communities' discharges, will remain unchanged by an injunction. An injunction would keep in place current permit requirements, with most that include toxicity requirements in 28 accordance with the 2002 Methods and federal regulations. 20
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

CEQA, Public Resources Code section 21168.5, this Court has jurisdiction to exercise its
2 independent judgment of the evidence to determine whether the State Board prejudicially abused

3 its discretion by proceeding in a manner contrary to law, or to determine if the decision was

4 supported by substantial evidence. A court "exercises independent judgment in determining

5 whether the agency action was consistent with applicable law." (Neighbors in Support of
6 Appropriate Land Use v. County of Tuolumne (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 997, 1004 [internal
7 quotations and citations omitted].)

74. When reviewing quasi-legislative actions, a court may substitute its own policy
judgment for the agency's where the agency's action was arbitrary and capricious. (Pitts v. Perluss
10 (1962) 58 Cal.2d 824, 832-833; O.W.L. Foundation v. City of Rohnert Park (2008) 168

11 Cal.App.4th 568, 585.)

12 75. A court will overturn an agency's decision if the decision is: (1) arbitrary, d'TT UNVIE AHNMOI 13  capricious, or entirely lacking in evidentiary support; (2) contrary to established public policy; (3)
14 unlawful; or (4) procedurally unfair; or where the agency failed to follow procedures and give
15 notices required by law. (Vallejo Police Officers Assn. v. City of Vallejo (2017) 15 Cal.App.5th
16 601, 611.) The agency must also produce findings or other justification for its actions in order to
17 | "bridge the analytical gap between the raw evidence and ultimate decision or order." (Topanga
18 Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 515 ("Topanga");
19| accord, Next Century Associates, LLC v. County of Los Angeles (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 713, 723.)

20 76. While a court cannot compel an agency to exercise its discretion in a specific way,

21 a court may compel that agency "both to exercise [its] discretion (if [it] is required by law to do

22 so) and to exercise it under a proper interpretation of the applicable law." (California Assn. for
23 v. Health Services at Home v. State Dept. of Health Care Services (2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 676, 683.)

24 77. When evaluating the proper interpretation of a rule, "[c]ourts must, in short,
25 independently judge the text of the statute, taking into account and respecting the agency's
26 interpretation of its meaning, of course, whether embodied in a formal rule or less formal
27 representation. Where the meaning and legal effect of a statute is the issue, an agency's
28  interpretation is one among several tools available to the court. Depending on the context, it may
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 be helpful, enlightening, even convincing. It may sometimes be of little worth. 'The standard

2 for judicial review of agency interpretation of law is the independent judgment of the court, giving
3 deference to the determination of the agency appropriate to the circumstances of the agency
4l action.'* (Yamaha Corp. of Am. V. State Bd. of Equalization (1997)19 Cal. 4th 1, 7-8 quoting 27
5 Cal. Law Revision Com. Rep. (1997) p. 81.)

6 78. Petitioners/Plaintiffs also seek declaratory relief, which is available where there is

7 an "actual controversy relating to the legal rights and duties of the .. . parties." (Code Civ. Proc., §
8 1060.) "The 'actual controversy' referred to in this statute . admits of definitive and conclusive

9 relief by judgment.. ., as distinguished from an advisory opinion upon a particular or hypothetical
10 state of facts." (Selby Realty Co. v. City of San Buenaventura (1973) 10 Cal.3d 110, 117.)

11 79. Petitioners/Plaintiffs seek a declaration by this Court regarding the validity of the

JTT UNVHE AHNMOI 12 Provisions and whether they are reasonable necessary to effectuate the purpose of the Act. "[A]
13 reviewing court must apply a 'substantial evidence' standard when determining whether a
14 regulation is reasonably necessary." (Agric. Labor Relations Bd. v. Exeter Packers, Inc. (1986)
15 184 Cal.App.3d 483, 491-92; see also Gov. Code § 11350.) §

16 80. Finally, Petitioners/Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief to avoid implementation of
17 these rules, which are likely to be determined unlawful, during judicial review.

18 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

19 (Writ of Mandate and Declaratory and Injunctive Relief for

20 Failure to Comply with the Clean Water Act and Federal Regulations)

21 81. Petitioners/Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 80 as
22 though set forth in full herein.

23 82. The State Board, under its delegated authority to implement the Clean Water Act,
24 must act consistently with that Act and its implementing regulations. (Wat. Code, §§13160,
25 13370(c).) For the following reasons, the State Board in adopting the Provisions substantially
26 failed to comply with the requirements of the Clean Water Act and its implementing regulations:

27 (a) Contrary to state law requiring consistency with the CWA, the Provisions' use of the

28 TST violated federal law and the Proyisions and its authorizing adoption Resolution
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 contained factual inaccuracies.

2 (b) The Provision's required Maximum Daily and Monthly Median Effluent Limits for

3 POTWs, which are contrary to federal law requirements contained in 40 C.F.R.
4 section 122.45(d)(2), and the State Board failed to adequately justify its findings of

5 impracticability.

6 (c) The Provisions ignored federal law requirements in 40 C.F.R. section 122.44(d)(1) to

7 conduct a reasonable potential analysis and determine that reasonable potential exists

8 to exceed applicable water quality standards prior to imposing effluent limitations.

9 A. The Provisions Related to the TST are Factually Inaccurate and Contrary to Law.

10 83. The Provisions did not utilize one of the legally approved options in the 2002

11 Methods, and instead utilized a statistical procedure called the Test of Significant Toxicity

d'TT INVAE AINMOG 12 ("TST") that was issued as guidance not formally promulgated - by EPA in 2010. (See EPA,
13 National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Test of Significant Toxicity Implementation
14 Document, EPA 833-R-10-004 (June 2010), located at following website last accessed Dec. 30,
15 2020: https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/wet_final_tst_implementation2010.pdf.)

16 84. The TST relied upon and cited in the Provisions was not in a rule contained in 40
17 C.F.R. Part 136, which is required for monitoring and compliance purposes under federal law.

18 (40 C.F.R. $122.41(j)(4)("Monitoring must be conducted according to test procedures approved

19 under 40 CFR Part 136...) (emphasis added).). The 2010 TST guidance document recognizes that
20 it is not to be used as a rule by stating that the guidance "cannot impose any legally binding
21 requirements on EPA, states, NPDES permittees, or laboratories conducting or using WET testing
22 for permittees." Thus, the TST guidance cannot be lawfully used in the Provisions as a
23 replacement method for defining water quality objectives, determining the need for toxicity limits,
24 setting effluent limits, or determining compliance.

25 85. Any other ruling would be inconsistent with other language of the TST guidance
26 document itself that recognizes that "The document does not ...substitute for the CWA, an

27 NPDES permit, or EPA or state regulations applicable to permits or WET testing; nor is this
28 document a permit or regulation itself." Thus, the, State Board acted in a manner contrary to the
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

guidance document upon which it relied.

2 86. The late changes to the Provisions proposed a new paragraph 16 for the adoption
3 Resolution, which states in pertinent part that "the Toxicity Provisions do not change the test
methods. The test method manuals contain specific requirements or recommendations on how to
5 conduct a test." This statement, along with other statements included in the Provisions, is untrue
6 and inaccurate. The Provisions do change the test methods in the ways described below.
7 87.

8 The method manuals incorporated by reference into the Part 136 methods adopted
by regulation in 2002 (2002 Methods) include more than requirements to avoid or prevent
9 laboratory interference, as set forth in the adoption Resolution's Paragraph 16 and the Provisions.
10 Thus, this new paragraph and the similar statements in the Provisions are both inaccurate and
11 misleading.

DOWNEY BRAND LLP 12 88. The 2002 Methods specify the hypothesis to be used, the test endpoints, a flow
13 chart for conducting test and reporting results, authorized statistics (not including the TST), and
14 procedural safeguards to ensure the results are accurate. As stated in comment letters and sworn
15 testimony to the State Board, and contrary to the conclusion reached in the adoption Resolution's
16 Paragraph 16 and the Provisions, the Provisions change the federally prescribed 2002 Methods in

14 89. In the legal challenge to the 2002 Methods, the court found that "[t]he ratified WET
15 tests are not without their flaws." (Edison Electric at 1274.) Nevertheless, the appellate court
16 upheld those methods because the Court found that EPA had provided adequate safeguards within
17 those methods to protect against the concerns raised by the plaintiffs. One of these safeguards was
18 the use of a multiple-concentration test to provide an adequate dose response, which has been
19 proposed to be removed under the Provisions through the prescribed use of the TST.
20 90. "EPA also offered an additional safeguard by designing the tests to give permittees

22 rates up to 20%." (Edison Electric, 391 F. 3d at 1272.) These safeguards have been effectively

24 5 EPA's currently promulgated chronic toxicity test methods include four (4) specified statistical methods that may be used with hypothesis tests. These approved statistics are specified in detail 25 as follows: 1) Dunnett's Procedure; 2) T-test with the Bonferroni Adjustment; 3) Steel's Many-
26 One Rank Test; and 4) Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test with the Bonferroni Adjustment, (EPA Short- term Methods for Estimating the Chronic Toxicity of Effuents and Receiving Waters to 27 Freshwater Organisms, Fourth Ed. EPA 821-R-02-013, Oct. 2002 ("Short-Term Methods") at pp. 44-45, Section 9.6 Hypothesis Tests.) Each of these four statistical methods can be used for 28 hypothesis tests resulting in the NOEC/LOEC endpoints set by the promulgated rules. 25
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

removed because the TST, as being prescribed in the Provisions for use in water quality
2 characterization and in NPDES permits, authorizes use of a two-concentration test for compliance
3 determination purposes (if an Alternative Test Procedure (ATP) from EPA is approved), which
4 merely compares an effluent sample at 100% strength to a control blank.

5 91. In addition, the false indication of toxicity rate is at least 14-20%, if not as high as
6 50% (see Paragraph 64 above) - values that would inevitably have been deemed unacceptable in
7 the Edison Electric case. Thus, the State Board's authorization of the TST in the Provisions not

8 only ignores the procedural and technical safeguards ensured by the Edison Electric case, but
9 imposes requirements contrary to binding state and federal requirements discussed herein. The
10 only hope to stop the continued use and authorization of use of the TST in the Provisions is a

DOWNEY BRAND LLP 11 judiciary ruling that the State Board's actions were unlawful and improper and an injunction on
12 the use of the TST guidance.

13 92. The Provisions use of "Pass/Fail" or "Greater than 50% Effect"' are not approved
14 endpoints contained in the federal rules and, thus, are inconsistent with state law requirements
15 requiring consistency. In fact, the promulgated methods specifically state that "Use of pass/fail
16 tests consisting of a single effluent concentration (e.g., the receiving water concentration or RWC)
17 and a control is not recommended." (See Short-Term Methods at p. 5, Section 2.2.3 (emphasis in
18 original).) Thus, not only is the TST not included in the required promulgated methods
19 incorporated into the federal rules, the Provision's use of a single pass/fail result based on a single
20 concentration is expressly discouraged in the 2002 Methods. (Id.; see also infra footnote 12, and
21 EPA Technical Support Document for Water Quality-based Toxics Control, EPA/505/2-90-001,
22 Mar. 1991 at p. 57 ("single dilution toxicity tests are much more variable than multiple dilution
23 tests. Therefore, the use of single concentration toxicity tests is strongly discouraged for this
24 data generation process." (emphasis in original).)
25 93. The Provisions wrongfully failed to use the 2002 Methods' NOEC with approved
26 statistics or the IC25 procedures, as required by Water Code section 13160. In relation to the four
27 approved statistics (see supra footnote 9), the 2002 Methods did recognize that "[t]he statistical
28 methods recommended in this manual are not the only possible methods of statistical analysis."

FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 (Short-Term Methods at p. 40, Section 9.4.1.2; 67 Fed. Reg. at 69,964). However, the Provisions
2 took this one statement out of context, ignoring the remaining explanatory statements. (Provisions
3 at Section 2.6.5.)

4 94. The directly following language in the 2002 Methods expressly states that: "Many

5 other methods have been proposed and considered. Certainly there are other reasonable and
6 defensible methods of statistical analysis for this kind of toxicity data." (Short-Term Methods at

7 p. 40, Section 9.4.1.2.) However, "the statistical methods contained in this manual have been
8 chosen because they are (1) applicable to most of the different toxicity test data sets for which they
9 are recommended, (2) powerful statistical tests, (3) hopefully 'easily' understood by
10 nonstatisticians, and (4) amenable to use without a computer, if necessary." (Id. (italics added).)

11 Although EPA knew other statistical methods existed, or could exist in the future, EPA identified

dTI UNVHE AHNMOC 12 and chose the specific statistical methods and hypothesis tests delineated in that manual and
13 expressly incorporated by reference into Part 136.10 The promulgated methods standardized
14 testing procedures to be consistent nationwide, even though other procedures existed. The
15 Provisions would thwart that nationwide consistency, as well as consistency with federal law as
16 required by the Water Code. (Wat. Code §§13160, 13370(c).)

17 95. Although the Provisions claim that "The TST approach is a statistical option that
18 U.S. EPA has added to the current recommended statistical approaches" (Provisions at Section
19  2.6.5), use of statistical approaches not included in the promulgated rules is prohibited by law,
20 including the APA and other federal regulations. (See accord Gov. Code, §11353; 40 C.F.R.
21 §122.41 (j)(4)("Monitoring must be conducted according to test procedures approved under
22 40 CFR Part 136...) (emphasis added).) The State Board has no authority to add or use new
23 statistical methods for NPDES permitting or compliance purposes. Thus, state court intervention
24 is needed to halt the State Board's subversion of the federal rulemaking process, by direct use of
25 unpromulgated federal guidance documents.

96. Many of the important quality assurance/quality control ("QA/QC") procedures

2 established by EPA in the 2002 Methods to assure the accuracy and reliability of WET test results
3  become obsolete and irrelevant if the TST method is mandated in the Provisions. For example,
4 laboratories routinely prepare control charts reporting the results of their reference toxicant tests
5 based on the NOEC or IC25. Neither the State in the Provisions nor EPA has established an

6 equivalent control chart metric for the TST. The existing federal requirement to calculate the
7| Percent Minimum Significant Difference ("PMSD," a mandatory regulatory measure of test
8 sensitivity) does not apply when using the TST. Thus, the TST definitely modifies the
9 requirements of the promulgated 2002 Methods.
10 97. Any claim that the TST is "at least as sensitive" as the NOEC or IC25 is based
11 solely on the observation that the TST may indicate the presence of toxicity more often than either
d'TI ONVHE AINMOI 12 of the promulgated methods. However, more frequent indication of toxicity only demonstrates
13 greater sensitivity if the results are actually accurate. As noted above, the TST procedure finds
14 non-toxic method blank samples to be "toxic" at least twice as often as the NOEC or IC25.
15 Consequently, no reason exists to conclude that the TST is better than (or even as good as) the
16 current promulgated statistical measures. Further, no basis was provided in the Provisions to
17 demonstrate that TST results will correlate well with the richness and abundance of aquatic
18 organisms downstream of any given discharge.

19 98. The State Board lacks the authority to require use of the TST procedure in the
20 Provisions in lieu of using the federally mandated, formally promulgated methods (NOEC or
21 IC25) for the purpose of determining ambient water quality or determining the need for, imposing,
22 and assessing compliance with effluent limitations in an NPDES permit. (Wat. Code §§13160,
23 13370(c).)

24 99. Because the State Board's actions in adopting the TST-related parts of the
25 Provisions was contrary to federal law requirements, applicable to the State Board via Water Code
26 sections 13160 and 13370(c), this Court should declare the Provisions unlawful and issue a writ of
27 mandate directing the State Board to set aside its adoption of the Provisions.

1 B. The Provision's Requirements for Maximum Daily and Monthly Median Limits are Contrary to Federal Law Requirements Binding on the State Board. 2

3 100. For POTWs, federal rules require only monthly average and weekly average

4 effluent limitations, unless "impracticable." (See 40 C.F.R. §122.45(d)(2).) Several state courts

5 have already ruled as such.'1 These courts ruled in this manner notwithstanding previously cited
6 EPA guidance documents, cited again in the Provisions Staff Report and SED, that contradict
7 EPA's promulgated rule and state that limits for POTWs should be daily maximum instead of

8 weekly average limits.

9 101. In other words, state courts have held that guidance documents cannot be used to
10 overrule the express terms of the regulations. (See CSPA case, Exhibit C, at p. 23 ("To the extent
11 that the applicable law does not represent a reasonable approach to establishing effluent

dTI ONVHE AANMOG 12 limitations, the law may need to be changed. Until it is changed, however, that law unequivocally
13 requires the establishment of a weekly limitation. Respondent [Regional] Board was obligated to

14 do what the law required…...").) In these cases, reliance on EPA's guidance was overturned, and
15 the permits were remanded to follow the letter of the promulgated rules.

16 102. The same result should occur here, as the State Board has failed to adequately
17 demonstrate that monthly and weekly average limits are "impracticable" as required. While an
18 attempt to claim impracticability has been included in the more recent versions of the Provisions,
19 that attempt fails as inaccurate and because the State Board's findings are not based on substantial

20 l evidence. The Provisions also failed to consider other options in the case of impracticability (e.g.,

21 an annual average or median), which could have allowed less testing, lower costs, and less impacts
22 related to monitoring. Instead, the Provisions mandate that future permits must include a chronic

2 median effluent limitation ("MMEL") for virtually all permittees controlled by the Provisions.
3 (See e.g., Provisions at section IV.B.2.e.; see also section IV.B.2.f. (acute toxicity limits).)

4 103. Because the State Board ignored binding federal regulations, and instead, relied

5 upon contrary EPA guidance as an underground regulation justifying its decision, the Provisions
6 should be declared unlawful and this court should issue a writ of mandate directing the State
7 Board to set aside its adoption of the Provisions. (See accord Morning Star Co. v. State Bd. of
8 Equalization (2006) 38 Cal.4th 324 (the use of an invalid regulation required a remand so that the
9 agency could conduct further proceedings without relying upon the invalid regulation).)
10 C. The Provisions Ignore Binding Federal "Reasonable Potential" Requirements.

11 104. Federal requirements binding on states administering NPDES permits do not

d'IT UNVAEI AENMOG 12 require all permits to include effluent limitations for all pollutants. Instead, federal rules only
13 require that dischargers with "reasonable potential" have effluent limitations. (See 40 C.F.R.
14 §122.44(d)(1)(iv)("When the permitting authority determines, using the procedures in paragraph
15 (d)(1)(ii) of this section, that a discharge causes, has the reasonable potential to cause, or
16 contributes to an in-stream excursion above the numeric criterion for whole effluent toxicity, the
17 permit must contain effluent limits for whole effluent toxicity."); applicable and binding on the
18 State Board via Wat. Code 8§13160, 13370(c).)

19 105. Section 122.44(d)(1)(ii) states: "When determining whether a discharge causes, has
20 the reasonable potential to cause, or contributes to an in-stream excursion above a narrative or
21 numeric criteria within a State water quality standard, the permitting authority shall use procedures
22

23 12 Even by EPA's calculations, WET tests will be wrong some of the time, which is why EPA 24 warned against using single test result to institute an action for a civil penalty. See Edison Electric at 1272 citing 67 Fed. Reg. at 69,968. The Edison Electric court went on to say that: 25 "Nothing we have written thus far, and nothing we write in the balance of this opinion forecloses consideration of the validity of a particular test result in an enforcement action. See 33 U.S.C. cc 26 1369(b)(2)." However, since test results must be submitted and certified under penalty of perjury, it is unclear whether the validity of the results could later be challenged. Thus, insuring the best 27 possible result, based on EPA promulgated methods is required. Since the TST does not always arrive at the same answer as the results using the 2002 Methods, such result in suspect and 28 | inconsistent with federal law requirements. 30

1 which account for existing controls on point and nonpoint sources of pollution, the variability of
2 the pollutant or pollutant parameter in the effluent, the sensitivity of the species to toxicity testing
3 (when evaluating whole effluent toxicity), and where appropriate, the dilution of the effluent in the
4 receiving water." (40 C.F.R. §122.44(d)(1)(ii).) This mandatory analysis is known as a
5 "Reasonable Potential Analysis," applicable to all NPDES-permitted dischargers. Without a
6 supportable and site-specific finding of "reasonable potential" for each constituent or parameter,
7 an effluent limitation cannot be established. (Id.)

8 106. Discharge limits for whole effluent toxicity are not required where there is no
reasonable potential to cause or contribute to an in-stream excursion above a numeric or narrative
10 criterion for whole effluent toxicity.13 (40 C.F.R. §122.44(d)(1)(iv) and (v).) Further, "Limits on

DOWNEY BRAND LLP 11 whole effluent toxicity are not necessary where the permitting authority demonstrates in the fact
12 sheet or statement of basis of the NPDES permit, using the procedures in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of
13 this section, that chemical-specific limits for the effluent are sufficient to attain and maintain
14 applicable numeric and narrative State water quality standards." (40 C.F.R. §122.44(d)(1)(v).)
15 107. The Provisions ignore this well-reasoned regulatory approach adopted by EPA in
16 its federal rules and instead assign effluent limitations to all POTWs authorized to discharge at a
17 rate equal to or greater than 5 million gallons per day ("MGD"), and that are required to have a
18 pretreatment program by the terms of 40 CFR § 403.8(a) (effective January 1, 2020), without first
19 requiring a reasonable potential analysis. Contrary to federal requirements, the Provisions state "a
20 reasonable potential analysis would not be required for these dischargers before a Water Board
21 included effluent limitations for toxicity in a permit." (Provisions at Section 5.4.2.)
22

23 13 No field studies demonstrate that chronic WET test results derived using the TST two concentration pass/fail procedure are well-correlated with actual instream conditions. Such studies 24 are essential to prove that the TST produces results "comparable" to the existing methods that have already been field-validated. According to EPA's own Administrative Law Judge: ". the
25 proposed [toxicity] tests must be reasonably related to determining whether the discharge could

26 lead to 'real world' effects. The Clean Water Act objective to prohibit the discharge of "toxic

27 pollutants in toxic amounts' concerns toxicity in the receiving waters of the United States, not the laboratory tank.' (In the Matter of Metropolitan Dade County (Fla.), Miami-Date Water and Sewer Authority (NPDES Permit No. FL0224805), 1996 USEPA ALJ Lexis 80 (Oct. 3, 28 1996)(emphasis added).)
31

108. This regulatory distinction is arbitrary and capricious because:

2 (a) A larger POTW may have a higher level of treatment and no history of

3 toxicity that would justify imposition of effluent limits and the increased

4 monitoring and likelihood of enforcement that follows.

5 (b) A POTW with the authority to discharge up to or more than 5 MGD may

6 not have current discharge levels approaching this amount, and might be

7 substantially less than another POTW not subject to this part of the

8 Provisions, denying them equal protection under the law.

9 (c) An industrial or other discharger of a similar size (greater than 5 MGD)
10 would have the benefit of a reasonable potential analysis instead of

11 automatic (and potentially unwarranted) effluent limitations.
The record contains no evidence that POTWs with the authority to dTI ANVHA AHNMOI 12 (d)

13 discharge over 5 MGD have a greater likelihood to cause or contribute to an
14 instream exceedance of toxicity objectives. In fact, the administrative
15 record shows that pesticides contained in agricultural and urban runoff are
16 to ambient water toxicity, yet those sources are not being larger contributors

17 regulated in the Provisions, 14 and other sources demonstrated to cause

18 toxicity were exempted from the Provisions (e.g., potable water discharges

19 containing toxic levels of chlorine and direct pesticide applications). (See

20 Provisions at Section 5.7.5 to 5.7.7.)

21 109. Additionally, the Provisions' mandates in absence of a Reasonable Potential
22 Analysis contradicts precedential State Board orders recognizing the need for and authorizing use
23 of that information prior to imposing effluent limitations, or as a basis to remove existing effluent
24 limitations. (See State Board Order No. WQO 2003-0009 at pages 8-9.15) Where monitoring data

indicate that the discharge of a pollutant does not have reasonable potential to cause or contribute
to a water quality standards violation, the effluent limits for that pollutant should not be imposed,

Board, as well as precedential State Board orders, this Court should declare these challenged parts
of the Provisions (e.g., use of the TST, inclusion of MDELs and MMELs for POTWs, and lack of

111. Petitioners/Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 110 as
14 though set forth in full herein.
15 112. For the following reasons, the State Board's adoption of the Provisions violated State
16 law related to water quality regulation, and must be set aside:

17 (a)

18 Adoption of the Provisions exceeded the State Board's authority under Water

19 Code section 13170 because the Board's authority to adopt statewide water

20 quality control plans extends only to "waters of the United States" for which

21 water quality standards are required under the Clean Water Act, not all waters of

22 the State. Since the State Board's Provisions apply to all waters of the State and

23 included water quality standards not required under the Clean Water Act, the

24 Bill Robinson, State Board Order WQO 2003-0009, 2003 WL 25914831 (Cal.St.Wat.Res.Bd. July 25 16, 2003) states: "The term 'reasonable potential' is based on 40 C.F.R. § 122.44(d)(1)(i), which
26 requires that permit issuers include effluent limitations for all pollutants that 'are or may be

27 discharged at a level which will cause, have the reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to an excursion above any State water quality standard, including State narrative criteria for water quality.' If a pollutant does not require a limit under this test, the pollutant is said not to have is 28 *reasonable potential.?"

1 State Board exceeded its legal authority.

2 (b) Despite labeling the Provisions as water quality control plan amendments, the

3 Provisions actually represent policy for which the Board is attempting to provide
4 regulatory guidance. The Provisions unlawfully failed to include all of the

5 mandatory components of a water quality control plan.

6 (c) The State Board failed to comply with the terms of Water Code section 13165

7 prior to requiring extensive new toxicity monitoring requirements.

8 A. The Provisions Exceeded the State Board's Authority under the Water Code.

9 113. The State Board cites to Water Code section 13170 as the basis of its authority to
10 adopt the Provisions as amendments to statewide water quality control plans. (See Provisions at
11 Section 3.1.)

12 114. Water Code section 13170 authorizes the State Board to adopt water quality control d'TT ONVIE AENMOC 13 plans "….for waters for which water quality standards are required by the Federal Water Pollution
14 Control Act and acts amendatory thereof and supplementary thereto." (Wat. Code, §13170.)
15 Another name for the Federal Water Pollution Control Act is the Clean Water Act. (PUD No. 1 v.

16 Wash. Dep't of Ecology (1994) 511 U.S. 700, 704.) In other words, Section 13170 only authorizes
17 the State Board to formulate water quality control plans for waters of the United States, and not
18 for other state-only waters subject to Porter-Cologne. Other authorities, such as Water Code
19 sections 13140 and 13142, only provide authority for and components of water quality policy-
20 making, not for adoption of water quality control plans, so these provisions cannot serve as the
21 basis for adoption of WQCP provisions related to toxicity. (See Briggs v. Eden V. Council for Hope
22 & Opportunity (1999) 19 Cal.4th 1106,1117 ["Where different words or phrases are used in the
23 same connection in different parts of a statute, it is presumed the Legislature intended a different
24 meaning"].)

25 115. Yet, the Provisions purport to apply their terms to all waters of the state, except
26 groundwater, ocean waters, and open bays (see infra paragraph 124). Thus, the State Board
27 exceeded its authority for water quality control planning, which is limited only to waters of the

28 United States. 34
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

116. Clean Water Act section 1313, the section authorizing the promulgation of water
2 quality standards, applies only to "navigable waters" of the United States. (33 U.S.C.
3 §§1313(c)(2)(A) and (c)(4) (discussing "navigable waters"); 40 C.F.R. §122.2.) Thus, Water

4 Code section 13170 limits the State Board's authority to navigable waters of the United States as
5 defined by law and federal court cases. (See accord Rapanos v. United States (2006) 547 U.S. 715,
6 723-729[*[N]onnavigable, isolated, intrastate waters,' were not "waters of the United States"]; 33
§ 7  U.S.C. § 1313(c)(2)(A) [A state's "revised or new water quality standard shall consist of the
8 designated uses of the navigable waters involved and the water quality criteria for such waters based

9 upon such uses."].)

10 117. Because the State Board was not authorized to apply the Provisions to waters other

DOWNEY BRAND LLP 11 than those regulated by the Clean Water Act, the State Board should be enjoined from applying
12 the Provisions to such other non-federally jurisdictional waters.

13 118. In addition, the State Board's authority is limited to only those water quality
14 standards "required by" the Clean Water Act. The only mandated water quality standards are those
15 for "criteria for all toxic pollutants listed pursuant to section 1317(a)(1) of this title for which criteria
16 have been published under section 1314(a) of this title, the discharge or presence of which in the
17 affected waters could reasonably be expected to interfere with those designated uses adopted by the
18 State, as necessary to support such designated uses. Such criteria shall be specific numerical criteria
19 for such toxic pollutants." (33 U.S.C. §1313(c)(2)(B).) Whole effluent toxicity is not a "toxic
20 pollutant[] listed pursuant to section 1317(a)(1)," and no guidance criteria for toxicity "have been
21 published under section 1314(a) of this title." (Id.) Thus, the State Board exceeded its authority as no
22 water quality standards are required under the Clean Water Act for whole effluent toxicity.

23 119. The Clean Water Act at section 1313 goes on to state that "Where such numerical
24 criteria are not available, whenever a State reviews water quality standards pursuant to paragraph (1),

25 or revises or adopts new standards pursuant to this paragraph, such State shall adopt criteria based on
26 biological monitoring or assessment methods consistent with information published pursuant to section
27 I 1314(a)(8) of this title." (33 U.S.C. §1313(c)(2)(B).) For the reasons set forth above, the State
28 failed to adopt monitoring and assessment methods consistent with CWA section 1314(a)(8), 35

which requires that EPA must "develop and publish information on the methods for establishing
2 and measuring water quality criteria," which EPA did in the 2002 Methods. (33 U.S.C.
3 |§1314(a)(8).) By using a guidance document instead of the published 2002 Methods, the State

4

5 Board acted beyond the scope of its authority under Water Code section 13170.
120. Because the State Board was not authorized to apply the Provisions where water
6 quality standards are not required by the Clean Water Act, the State Board should be enjoined

8 from applying and enforcing the water quality standards and related portions of the Provisions to
non-waters of the United States.

9 121. Further, because the State Board's action was contrary to state and federal law
10 requirements related to the need for further water quality standards setting, this Court should
11 declare the Provisions to be unlawful and issue a writ of mandate directing the State Board to set

DOWNEY BRAND LLP 12 aside its adoption of the Provisions.

13

14 B. The Provisions Fail to Comply with Basin Planning Requirements.

122. The Provisions do not include all of the mandatory components of a water quality
15 control plan (i.e., designation of beneficial uses, setting of water quality objectives, and the
16 establishment of a program of implementation). (Wat. Code, $§13050, 13242.)
17 123. Under Water Code section 13050(j), a water quality control plan "consists of a
18 designation or establishment for the waters within a specified area of all of the following:
19 (1) Beneficial uses to be protected.

20 (2) Water quality objectives.

21 (3) A program of implementation needed for achieving water quality objectives."
22 (Wat. Code, §13050(j)(italics added).)

23 124. The Provisions do not designate or establish beneficial uses, but merely recite
24 beneficial uses designated in regional water quality control plans as follows:
25

26 "The Provisions would apply to inland surface waters, enclosed bays, and estuaries and coastal lagoons in California for the protection of aquatic life beneficial uses. These

27 beneficial uses include but are not limited to: warm freshwater habitat (WARM), cold freshwater habitat (COLD), wildlife habitat (WILD), estuarine habitat (EST), preservation

28 of rare, threatened, or endangered species (RARE), migration of aquatic organisms (MIGR), spawning reproduction and/or carly development (SPWN), marine habitat (MAR), inland saline water habitat (SAL), and wetland habitat (WET). The Provisions
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

would not apply to groundwater ocean waters [sic], and open bays such as Monterey Bay and Santa Monica Bay.'
(Provisions at Section 2.4; see also Section 9.1.1 ("The Provisions do not designate or de-

4 designate beneficial uses, but rather put forth statewide numeric water quality objectives and a
program of implementation to protect all aquatic life beneficial uses in the state's inland waters,
enclosed bays, and estuaries.").)

125. The Provisions purport to establish water quality objectives for acute and chronic 7

8 toxicity, but those objectives are contrary to and inconsistent with federal law since numeric
objectives were not required and are not based on federal water quality criteria established under 9

10 CWA section 1314. (33 U.S.C. §1314(a)(requiring EPA to develop and publish water quality

11 criteria for use by the states in adopting water quality standards); §1313(c)(2)(B) (referencing

12 section 1314(a)).) The objectives also do not supersede narrative objectives for toxicity contained
d'TT ONVHA AHNMOC 13 in regional Basin Plans, which may cause duplicative or unnecessary additional regulation for
toxicity.
14
126. Although the Provisions contain sections with basic text related to each factor set 15 forth in Water Code sections 13050 and 13241, the Provisions failed to adequately address and 16

17 support with evidence the factors required to be considered when adopting water quality

18 objectives, based on substantial evidence, particularly the factors related to economic

19 I considerations and the need to develop and use recycled water. (Wat. Code, § 13241(a)-(f).)
127. The Provisions lack an adequate program of implementation for achieving the 20

21 water quality objectives, which must include, but not be limited to:
(a) A description of the nature of actions which are necessary to achieve the 22
objectives, including recommendations for appropriate action by any entity, 23
public or private. 24
(b) A time schedule for the actions to be taken. 25
(c) A description of surveillance to be undertaken to determine compliance with 26
objectives. (Wat. Code, §13242; see accord 40 C.F.R. §130.6(c)(6).) 27
128. The Provisions fail to describe the nature of actions necessary to achieve the 28
37
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 objectives or recommended actions. (See Wat. Code, §13242(a).) The Provisions instead state that
2 such actions are too speculative to be determined, which fails to comply with state law
3 requirements. Further, the Provisions fail to meet state and federal requirements to include a time
4 schedule for actions to be taken and/or a compliance schedule for when the water quality

5 objectives will be obtained in the receiving waters. (Wat. Code, §13242(b); CWA, 33 U.S.C.
water quality standards).) 6 §1313(e)(3)(F)(requiring compliance schedules for revised or new

7 129. While the Provisions include effluent monitoring requirements, the Provisions fail

8 to include a "description of surveillance to be undertaken to determine compliance with

9 objectives" that will confirm compliance with the objectives in the receiving waters covered by the
10 Provisions. (Wat. Code, §13242(c).)

11 130. Because the Provisions do not contain each of the necessary components of a water

d'TI INVHE AENMOC 12 quality control plan, this Court should declare the Provisions to be unlawful and issue a writ of
13 mandate directing the State Board to set aside its adoption of the Provisions.

14 C. The Provision's Monitoring Requirements Fail to Comply with the Water Code.

15 131. Under State law, as part of the water quality planning process, the State Board (or
16 regional water quality control boards) may require investigations and reports related to water
17 quality provided that the burden, including costs of such reports, bears a reasonable relationship to
18 the need for the report and the benefits to be obtained therefrom. (Wat. Code, §13165; see accord
19 Wat. Code, §§13225(c) and 13267(b).)

20 132. The State Board failed to demonstrate that the increased monitoring burden bears a
21 reasonable relationship to the necessity and benefits. In fact, the Provisions fail to recognize or
22 cite to Water Code section 13165 at all. The Provisions failed to demonstrate that use of non-
23 promulgated methods for monitoring was appropriate or reasonably required and instead simply
24 suggest additional replicates of the tests be run (see e.g., Provisions at section IV.B.1.b.), at
25 additional cost and effort, in an attempt to achieve compliance. The Provisions also failed to adopt
26 less burdensome requirements.

27 133. Because the Provisions fail to comply with Water Code section 13165, this Court
28 should declare the Provisions to be unlawful and issue a writ of mandate directing the State Board 38
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 to set aside its adoption of the Provisions.

2 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

3 (Writ of Mandate and Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

4 for Failure to Comply with the APA)

5 134. Petitioners/Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in Paragraphs 1 through 133 as
6 though set forth in full herein.

7 A. The Provisions Fail to Comply with Government Code Requirements.

8 135. Government Code section 11353 requires that the State Board comply with the Clean

9 Water Act when adopting water quality control plan amendments, yet the State Board failed to comply
10 with the substantive and procedural requirements of that federal act as set forth in detail in the First

11 Cause of Action, which is incorporated herein by reference to avoid repetition.

12 136. Because the Provisions fail to comply with Government Code section 11353 and the d'TT ONVIE AINMOI 13 incorporated CWA requirements, this Court should declare the Provisions to be unlawful and issue
14 a writ of mandate directing the State Board to set aside its adoption of the Provisions.

15 B. The Provisions Fail to Meet APA Standards.

16 137. The State Board failed to comply with the APA provisions required to be met

17 pursuant to Section 11353, including but not limited to Section 11349.1.

18 138. The Provisions fail to meet each of the APA's standards for "necessity,"
19| "authority," "clarity," "consistency." "reference," and "non-duplication." (See Cal. Gov. Code cop
20 11349.1(a); § 11353(b)(2)(C) and (b)4).) When these deficiencies are considered along with the
21 Provisions' other deficiencies, it becomes clear that the State Board substantially failed to comply
22  with the APA's "basic minimum procedural requirements" for the adoption of regulations. (Sims
23 v. Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation (2013) 216 CA4th 1059, 1073-1075.)
24 139. As adopted, the Provisions lack Necessity since the rulemaking record fails to
25 demonstrate the need for the regulation by substantial evidence, and fails to effectuate the purpose
26  and mandate of the authorizing statutes. (Cal. Gov. Code § 11349(a); § 11340(c).) No problems

27 were indicated with the prior regulatory toxicity program implemented pursuant to federal
28 regulations, promulgated methods, and State Board Orders (e.g., Order Nos. WQO 2003-0012,
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2003-0013, 2008-0008, and 2012-0001) to justify this substantial departure. Moreover, the
2 claimed need to have consistency statewide was not achieved since the Provisions: a) do not
3 regulate all discharges consistently, b) exempt the most toxic discharges, c) continue disparate
4 narrative toxicity objectives in regional Basin Plans, and d) allow modifications that thwart
5 consistency.

6 140. The Provisions lack Authority by being contrary to requirements in state and
7 federal law that permit or obligate the State Board to act. (Cal. Gov. Code § 11349(b).) Utilizing
8 and relying on guidance documents instead of promulgated regulations clearly lacks any legal
9 authority.

10 141. The Provisions lack Clarity as many of the requirements are vague, ambiguous, or
11 unintelligible and are not easily understood by the general public or those persons directly affected

DOWNEY BRAND LLP 12 by the regulations. (Cal. Gov. Code § 11349(c); § 11340(b).).) As just one example, the water
13 quality objective adopted for chronic toxicity, as follows, is difficult if not impossible for a lay
14 person to comprehend:

15 Numeric Chronic Aquatic Toxicity Objective

16

17 The chronic aquatic toxicity is water quality objective is expressed as a NULL HYPOTHESIS and an ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS with a REGULATORY MANAGEMENT DECISION (RMD) of 0.75, where the following NULL HYPOTHESIS shall be used:

18

19 Ho: Mean RESPONSE (ambient water) ≤ 0.75 • mean RESPONSE (control)

20 In general terms, the NULL HYPOTHESIS is the following statement: is the ambient water is toxic because the RESPONSE (c.g., survival, reproduction, growth) of the test organisms in the ambient water sample is less than

21 or equal to 75 percent of the test organisms' RESPONSE in the control water sample.

And where the following ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS shall be used:

22

23 Ha: Mean RESPONSE (ambient water) > 0.75 • mean RESPONSE (control)

24 In general terms. the ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS is the following statement: the ambient water is not toxic because the RESPONSE (e.g., survival, reproduction, growth) of the test organisms in the ambient water sample

25 is greater than 75 percent of the test organisms' RESPONSE in the control water sample.

26 Attainment is of the water quality objective is demonstrated by conducting CHRONIC AQUATIC TOXICITY TESTING as described in Section IV.B.1.b and rejecting this NULL HYPOTHESIS in accordance with the TEST

27 OF SIGNIFICANT TOXICITY (TST) statistical approach described in Section IV.B.1.c. When the NULL HYPOTHESIS is rejected, the ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESIS is accepted in its place, and there is no

28 exceedance of the chronic aquatic toxicity water quality objective. Failing to reject the NULL HYPOTHESIS (referred to as a "fail") is equivalent to an exceedance of the chronic aquatic toxicity water quality objective.
40
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 142. The Provisions include regulatory text, such as the water quality objective included
2 above, which were not formulated in plain English, nor in a coherent and easy-to-read style. (Gov.
3 Code §11346.2(a)(1).) This convoluted text makes the regulations vague, unclear, and difficult for
4 the regulated community to readily comprehend in violation of the APA's standards.

143. The APA requires that regulations be "written or displayed so that the meaning of
6 regulations will be easily understood by those persons directly affected by them." (Gov. Code §§
7 11349-11349.1.) However, the Provisions' administrative record is rife with instances where the
8 regulated community expressed frustration with the construction and clarity of the Provisions,

9 creating an inherent difficulty in determining compliance obligations. The Provisions simply lack
10 the "clarity" required by the APA. Thus, the Provisions are void for vagueness.

11 144. The Provisions lack Consistency because these new rules are not in harmony with

dTI ONVHA AANMOC 12 and directly conflict or are contradictory to existing statutes, court decisions, or other provisions of
13 law. (Gov. Code § 11349(d).) As indicated above in the First and Second Causes of Action, the
14 Provisions lack "consistency" as these new rules are inconsistent with the CWA and Porter-
15 Cologne, and with the statutory text and legislative history of federal and state laws.

16 145. In addition to being contrary to Clean Water Act requirements, the Provisions are
17 inconsistent with and contradict federal case law, which requires certain checks and balances be
18 maintained when undertaking toxicity testing. By removing those regulatory safeguards and by
19 adopting a guidance approach, samples can result in a different answer than would be determined
20 under the promulgated methods.

21 146. The Provisions lack adequate Reference since contrary to statutory and regulatory
22 requirements and contrary to federal case law. (Gov. Code, § 11349(d).)

23 147. The Provisions fail to meet the Non-Duplication standard by adding new "numeric
24 toxicity objectives" without repealing narrative objectives that served the same purpose and could

25 require conflicting or duplicative requirements.

26 148. The Provisions also lack appropriate economic impact analysis and other requisite
27 analysis required by the APA. In addition, the State Board failed to summarize and respond to all
28 comments raised during hearings and other opportunities for public participation.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

149. For these reasons, the Provisions violate the APA, prejudiced the Petitioners/
2 Plaintiffs' due process rights, and must be declared invalid, and a writ must issue overturning
3 these regulations. In addition, as a result of the State Board's actions and inactions in failing to
4 comply with the requirements of the APA, the Provisions should be declared to be contrary to law.

150.

6 In the meantime, until judicial review is concluded, the court must issue an
injunction staying the implementation of the Provisions and maintaining the status quo. An
7 injunction will ensure that new permits are not written to implement the Provisions, which would
8 trigger additional permit appeals and as-applied challenges to the Provisions that would waste

9 administrative and judicial resources while the validity of the Provisions is being challenged
10 herein.

11 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

DOWNEY BRAND LLP 12

13 ( Writ of Mandate and Declaratory and Injunctive Relief for

14 Failure to Comply with CEQA)
151. Petitioners/Plaintiffs incorporate the allegations in Paragraphs through 150 as
15 though set forth in full herein.

16 152. CEQA, Public Resources Code sections 21000 et seq., required the State Board to
17 review potential significant environmental impacts by its actions in establishing the Provisions and
18 its component requirements. Respondent contends that the Water Quality Control Plan

19 process
represents certified program under the CEQA guidelines under 14 C.C.R. section 15251 and 23
20 CCR sections 3775-3782. (Provisions at Section 2.8.1.) As such, Respondent likely contends that
21 the Provisions' SED constitute the "functional equivalent" to an initial study, negative declaration,
22 and/or an environmental impact report and must satisfy a functionally equivalent of the analysis

23 otherwise required under CEQA.

24 153. With a certified regulatory program, the State Board was required to satisfy the
25 applicable CEQA regulatory requirements, including conducting an adequate "environmental
26 checklist," providing a description of the proposed activity, analyzing and reaching an informed
27 determination with respect to potential significant environmental impacts, analyzing reasonable
28 alternatives and mitigation measures to minimize any significant adverse impacts. (14 C.C.R.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

§§15250, 15252.)

2 154. In its final version of the SED, the State Board determined that many of the items

3 in the Provision's Checklist contained potentially significant impacts. In addition, the Provision's

4 mandatory findings of significance determined potentially significant impacts exist, and the
5 Provisions also contain a conclusion that the cumulative effects associated with the proposed
6 project could be potentially significant. However, the State Board failed to mitigate these impacts

7 or select less problematic alternatives.

8 155. The State Board's determination that no potentiality significant impacts from

9 monitoring are expected is contrary to the evidence and erroneous. Increased monitoring
10 requirements will necessarily increase the need to send samples to off-site laboratories, thereby
11 increasing impacts to at least air quality, greenhouse gases, energy, noise, and

d'TI INVIE AANMOI 12 transportation/traffic. Substantial evidence in the record shows that the Provisions would or may
13 have a significant effect on the environment, and reasonable alternatives and mitigation measures
14 were not adequately explored or incorporated.

15 156. The State Board's failings under CEQA included, but were not limited to, failing to
16 revise and recirculate the scoping documents when the regulations changed from a Policy to a
17 Plan; failing to adequately discuss consistency with regional plans; relying on an inadequate
18 project description; failing to adequately identify, analyze, and mitigate significant impacts to the
19 environment; failing to adequately consider alternatives; and failing to adequately respond to
20 comments. Any of these warrant overturning, vacating, and remanding the Provisions.

21 157. The potential significant environmental effects that the State Board failed to
22 adequately identify and address included, but are not limited to: 1) significantly more monitoring
23 requirements that could adversely impact the capacity of laboratories and increase impacts from
24 the additional vehicle miles traveled to deliver samples to accredited laboratories for results; 2)
25 significant impacts to public wastewater treatment plants that may require additional monitoring
26 and/or treatment technologies that may or may not resolve any toxicity indications seen; 3)
27 impacts on businesses and public entities related to enforcement actions that may result, even in
28 cases of false indications of toxicity. 43
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

158. The Provisions ignored public comments that contained substantial evidence that
2 the Provisions will have significant environmental and economic impacts, particularly on
3 governmental entities. No reasonable alternatives or mitigation measures were required or

4 implemented to address these impacts since the State Board failed to recognize the potential
impacts in the first place or claimed the impacts were too speculative to address.

159. The State Board's establishment of the Provisions without adequate compliance
7 with CEQA constitutes prejudicial abuse of discretion by failing to proceed in the manner

8 required by law and its findings and decisions are not supported by substantial evidence. Because

9 Respondent violated its clear duties under CEQA, the Provisions must be declared invalid and set
10  aside.

11 160. During the pendency of judicial review on this matter, the court must maintain the

d'TI ONVHE AHNMOG 12 status quo by issuing an injunction staying the implementation of the Provisions.

13 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

14 Petitioners/Plaintiffs respectfully requests that the Court grant the following relief:
15 1. Issue peremptory writ of mandate invalidating the Provisions, which were
16 adopted in a manner contrary to federal and state law, were inadequately supported by findings, or

17 were unsupported by evidence in the administrative record.

18 2. Issue declaration that the Provisions were not adopted in substantial compliance
19 with the Clean Water Act, Porter-Cologne, the California APA, and CEQA.
20 3. Issue an injunction maintaining the status quo and enjoining implementation of the
21 Provisions pending a final statement of decision and judgment in this case.
22 4. Attorneys' fees to Petitioners/Plaintiffs pursuant to CCP $1021.5.

23 5. Any other relief that the Court deems just and appropriate.

Dear Ms. Sobeck:

Pursuant to California Public Resources Code sections 21167 and 21167.5, please take notice that Petitioners/Plaintiffs, including Camarillo Sanitary District, City of Simi Valley, City of Thousand Oaks, and Southern California Alliance of Publicly Owned Treatment Works, intend to file petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief (the "Petition") pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and other state and federal laws challenging the December 1. 2020 approval by the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) of the Toxicity Provisions and the associated Supplemental Environmental Document (SED).
The Petition alleges, inter alia, that the SWRCB violated CEQA for reasons including, but not limited to, failing to revise and recirculate the scoping documents when the regulations changed from a policy to plan; failing to adequately discuss consistency with regional plans; relying on an inadequate project description; failing to adequately identify, analyze, and mitigate significant impacts to the environment; failing to adequately consider alternatives; and failing to adequately respond to comments.

Given the hope for a quick hearing on the merits of this case, we also respectfully request that State Water Resources Control Board prepare, lodge, and serve the administrative record of proceedings in this matter in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.6(b) and (e) and Government Code section 11523.

Toxicity in California Waters

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY L
Toxicity testing has been used to assess effluent and surface water quality in California since the mid-1980s. When combined with chemical analyses and other water quality measures, results of toxicity tests provide information regarding the capacity of water bodies to support aquatic
life beneficial uses. This report summarizes the findings of monitoring conducted by the Surface
Water Ambient Monitoring Program (SWAMP) and associated programs between 2001 and 2010. The report addresses a number of specific assessment questions related to surface water quality
in California.

SWAMP monitoring has demonstrated that surface water toxicity occurs in all regions of the state, but that a
greater number of toxic samples have been detected in the valleys and along the coast, the areas of greatest
human activity. In monitoring conducted between 2001 and 2010, greater than 50% of collection sites have
shown some degree of toxicity in fresh water and fresh water sediment samples and greater than 45% of the
sites have shown some degree of toxicity in marine sediment samples. Agricultural and urban sites showed
greater water and sediment toxicity than sites in less developed areas. While greater water toxicity has
been observed in agricultural sites relative to urban sites, there has been no difference in sediment toxicity
between urban and agricultural sites. The majority of the data presented in this report were obtained from
monitoring studies designed to increase understanding of potential biological impacts from human activities.
As such, site locations were generally targeted in lower watershed areas, such as tributary confluences
or upstream and downstream of potential pollutant sources. Only a minority of a the sites were selected
probabilistically (i.e., at random). Therefore, these data only characterize the sites monitored, and cannot be
used to make assumptions about unmonitored areas

Correlation analyses and toxicity identification evaluations (TIEs) were used to determine the likely causes
of surface water toxicity. TIEs conducted in water samples suggest that toxicity to invertebrate test species
(e.g., cladocera and amphipods) was most often caused by pesticides (e.g., diazinon and chlorpyrifos). More
recent studies also show that pyrethroid pesticides play a role in water column toxicity to amphipods. There
has been a limited number of TIEs conducted with fish and algae. Correlation analyses corroborate the TIE
findings. Although there have been fewer TIE studies of the causes of sediment toxicity, those that have been
conducted show that sediment toxicity is caused by pyrethroid and organophosphate pesticides. Fewer TIEs
have been conducted to determine causes of toxicity in marine receiving waters.

The principal approach to determine whether observations of toxicity in laboratory toxicity tests
are indicative of ecological impacts in receiving waters has been to conduct field bioassessments of
macroinvertebrate communities. These studies have included "triad" assessments of chemistry, toxicity,
and macroinvertebrate communities, the core components of SWAMP. Comprehensive studies in the Salinas

and Santa Maria rivers on the central coast have demonstrated that pesticide toxicity in the lower reaches
of these rivers is linked to impacts on resident aquatic insect communities. Similar studies of urban creeks
in the central valley have also shown linkages between laboratory toxicity tests and impacts on urban
stream macroinvertebrates. Additional research has suggested that habitat also plays an important role in the distribution of stream macroinvertebrates. One recommendation for future SWAMP monitoring is to
conduct further investigations of the linkages between surface water toxicity and receiving system impacts
on biological communities.

The value of utilizing the TST methodology is that it can be applied to
all ambient and effluent toxicity monitoring improving consistency and
comparability among all Water Board monitoring programs.

As part of State Water Board staff's development of a Policy for Toxicity Assessment and Control, a
prescribed statistical methodology for determining whether a sample is toxic is being considered. The
statistical approach uses the U.S. EPA's Test of Significant Toxicity (TST). The TST would be applicable to
monitoring conducted by SWAMP so an assessment of SWAMP toxicity data was conducted comparing the
results of toxicity tests using the TST and the traditional hypothesis testing approach. The analysis indicated
there is little difference in the assessment of ambient toxicity regardless of which statistical method is applied to
the data. The value of utilizing the TST methodology is that it can be applied to all ambient and effluent toxicity monitoring improving consistency and comparability among all Water Board monitoring programs.

Because evidence from SWAMP monitoring has demonstrated that pesticides are a primary cause of surface
water toxicity in California, this report describes a number of management initiatives which together
are designed to reduce pesticide loading. These include implementation of total maximum daily loads
(TMDLs) in specific watersheds, and pesticide label changes recommended by the U.S. EPA and California
Department of Pesticide Regulation to modify use of problem pesticides (e.g., organophosphate and
pyrethroid pesticides, respectively). This report also describes state and regional programs to implement
management practices to reduce runoff in urban and agricultural watersheds. These include incorporation
of Low Impact Development and other techniques to curb pollution loading in urban stormwater runoff, installation of management practices such as vegetated treatment systems and enzyme additions to reduce pesticides in agriculture runoff, and implementation of setbacks and buffer zones to reduce loading in urban
and agricultural watersheds. As the combination of management initiatives are implemented throughout
California, continued monitoring will be necessary to document how well they reduce contamination
and toxicity in State waters. SWAMP is uniquely positioned to document how management actions affect to
contamination and toxicity state-wide.

SECTION
INTRODUCTION
The California Water Quality Control Boards (Water Boards) began incorporating Whole Effluent Toxicity (WET) testing in wastewater discharge permits in the early 1980s. Since then toxicity has been used to assess ambient water quality in freshwater, estuarine, and marine habitats. When combined with chemical analyses and other water quality measures, results of toxicity tests
provide information regarding the capacity of water bodies to support aquatic life
beneficial uses.

The word "toxicity" is defined here as a statistically significant adverse impact on standard aquatic test
organisms in laboratory exposures. A number of different species, including crustaceans, algae, fish, and
mollusks, have been used, following widely accepted test protocols with strict quality assurance. Laboratory
toxicity test organisms are surrogates for aquatic species found in the environment. Toxicity tests are
especially useful in water quality monitoring because they can detect the effects of all chemicals (whether
measured or not) as well as pollutant mixtures. The organisms used in these tests have been chosen because
they are relatively sensitive to toxic chemicals.

The relationship between results of laboratory toxicity tests and the ecological health of aquatic ecosystems
has been the subject of much debate in the scientific literature. The majority opinion of scientists involved
in ecotoxicology have concluded that when appropriately applied, toxicity tests provide useful insights on
the potential effects of anthropogenic contaminants on aquatic systems. Assessments of ecosystem health
are most conclusive when they incorporate multiple measures, including toxicity tests, chemical analyses,
bioassessments, and measures of bioaccumulation (e.g. see Grothe et al., 1996; Ingersoll et al. 1997). These are the core components of the State Water Board's Surface Water Ambient Monitoring Program (SWAMP).
This document is the first comprehensive, statewide assessment of ambient toxicity monitoring data in over
a decade. The purpose of this document is to summarize the location and magnitude of toxicity observed
since the beginning of the SWAMP monitoring in 2001, to make recommendations for improving ambient
toxicity monitoring throughout the state, and to support recommendations for toxicity monitoring in the
Water Boards' regulatory programs.

and coastal waters using data from SWAMP and partner programs. The following
questions are addressed:

1. Where has toxicity been observed in California waters?
2. What is the magnitude of observed toxicity?
3. What chemicals have been implicated as causing toxicity?
4. What are the ecological implications of aquatic toxicity?
5. How do the results of toxicity measurements compare among waters draining urban, agricultural, and
other land cover areas?
6. How do toxicity test results compare when different statistical methods are applied, particularly with
respect to use of the EPA Test of Significant Toxicity?
7. What management initiatives have the potential to reduce toxicity associated with contaminants in
surface water?

CAVEATS C

The following points should be kept in mind when considering the information
presented here:

1. Most of the data presented here were obtained from monitoring studies designed to increase understanding of potential biological impacts from human activities. Site locations were generally targeted in lower watershed areas, such as tributary confluences or upstream and downstream of
potential pollutant sources. Only a minority of the sites were selected probabilistically (i.e., at random).
Therefore, these data only characterize the sites monitored, and cannot be used to make assumptions
about unmonitored areas.
2. The word "toxicity" is defined here as a statistically significant adverse impact on standard aquatic test
organisms in laboratory exposures. A number of different species, including crustaceans, algae, fish, and mollusks, have been used, following widely accepted test protocols with strict quality assurance. These
results should not be extrapolated to assess impacts on human health.
3. These results may underestimate ambient toxicity because most samples were collected as "grabs" by filling a sample bottle or collecting sediment at one point in time. Toxic chemicals often flow downstream
in pulses. Studies in which test organisms were caged in-stream often have detected toxicity when grab
sample tests have not.
4. The suite of standard laboratory toxicity test organisms do not represent the full range of sensitivity of
the resident community. That is to say that laboratory organisms represent a certain range of sensitivity to chemicals that may be either more or less sensitive than the organisms naturally living in the stream.
5. Acute toxicity tests might not reflect chronic toxicity. These programs assessed toxicity during a short a
duration of an organism's life cycle with the maximum duration of exposure of 10 days. These short
duration exposures may underestimate chronic toxicity effects associated with more realistic
instream exposures.
6. This assessment integrates data sets from a number of programs. This integration was made possible
by the SWAMP quality assurance conventions and the SWAMP and California Environmental Data
Exchange Network (CEDEN) data management system. There are, however, data from a number of other
monitoring programs that have not yet been submitted to CEDEN and were not used in this analysis.
Information on data sources is given in Tables 4 and 5.
7. The different programs often had different monitoring objectives, and there is large variation in the
number of samples collected at each site and the number of sites surveyed in each Region. This limits
the ability to make meaningful comparisons between different regions.

FINDINGS H
Information is presented below to answer the key assessment questions. Data sources
and literature cited are presented at the end of the report.

WHERE HAS TOXICITY BEEN OBSERVED IN CALIFORNIA WATERS?

The attached maps (Figures 1 - 6, at the end of this document) show locations of sites sampled for toxicity
by SWAMP and partner programs, and the intensity of toxicity observed in the water and sediment samples
collected at those sites. Sites are color coded using the categorization process described in Figure 11, which combines the results of all toxicity tests performed on samples collected at a site to quantify the degree of toxicity observed there. At sites where both water and sediment toxicity data were collected, two toxicity
categories were calculated, to separately summarize the degree of toxicity in water and in sediment. Toxicity endpoints evaluated in this analysis included the mortality of fish and invertebrates and the density of cells in growing cultures of single-celled algae. To control for variation in test organism performance, every
test result was expressed as a percentage of the survival or cell density observed in the laboratory control.
Sublethal endpoints, such as inhibition of reproduction or growth, were not considered. Relative to the
303(d) impaired waterbody listing process, a site coded "green" would not be listed for toxicity. Sites coded "yellow" to "red" may be listed if the number of toxic samples met the criteria outlined in the State Water
Board's Listing and Delisting Policy. This assessment used more recent data than was assessed for the most recent 303(d) impairment assessment so classifications identified here will not necessarily coincide with the
impaired waters list.

Toxicity has been observed in all Regions. Streams in upper watersheds and mountainous areas tend to produce fewer toxic samples, while samples from downstream sites in the valleys and along the coasts tend Lo be more toxic. These lower watershed sites drain larger areas with greater levels of human activity.
Consistent sediment toxicity has been observed in many bay and harbor sites. In most years since 1991, for
example, annual surveys of San Francisco Bay have shown at least moderate sediment toxicity at a number
of sites throughout the Bay.

WHAT IS THE MAGNITUDE OF OBSERVED TOXICITY?

Of the 617 sites monitored for water toxicity in this assessment, 327 (53%) had at least one sample in which
toxicity to at least one test species was observed. Of these, 65 (10.5% of the total) were classified as high toxicity sites, meaning that the average result for the most sensitive species in all samples at the site was

used throughout the United States, recent data suggest this protocol likely underestimates sediment toxicity. Research by Ingersoll et al. (2005) show that the 28 day
chronic growth and survival test with H. azteca is more sensitive than the 10 day test, and is a more conservative
indicator of ecological impacts. In addition to underestimating chronic sediment toxicity, 10 day H. azteca tests
conducted at 23 °C also underestimate pyrethroid pesticide toxicity because pyrethroids are more toxic at colder
temperatures. Recent state-wide monitoring in California by Holmes et al. (2008) showed much greater sediment
toxicity to amphipods in tests conducted at 15 °C VS. those conducted at 23 °C. Results showed this was due to
pyrethroid pesticides. Results of a SWAMP database query of freshwater habitats sampled throughout California showed that the average surface water temperature was 15.3°C and ranged from ~ 0 to 37°C in the in years 2001 - 2010

(n 12, 279; personal communication Cassandra Lamerdin). The average temperatures ranged between 11.3 °C and 21.9 °C. Note that these reflect discreet daytime temperatures measured during routine SWAMP monitoring and do not represent continuous temperature readings. This demonstrates that ambient temperatures in California are
sometimes far below the standard 23 °C H. azteca protocol temperature. Since photostable pyrethroids are present
year-round, this suggests that surface water toxicity due to pyrethroids is likely to be an even greater problem in
California watersheds than has previously been reported.

In addition to the freshwater stations, 171 harbor and bay sediment samples were monitored for toxicity, and 81 of
these were non-toxic (47.4%). Of the remaining sites, 90 (52.6%) were classified as demonstrating some toxicity,
and 24 (14%) were designated high toxicity (Figure 8).

HOW DO THE RESULTS OF TOXICITY MEASUREMENTS COMPARE AMONG WATERS DRAINING URBAN, AGRICULTURAL, AND OTHER LAND COVER AREAS?

Sites in agricultural and urban areas were significantly more toxic than sites in less developed areas (measured by
minimum observed survival or algal growth (% of control performance), Figure 9a and 9b), and greater percentages of urban and agricultural sites were toxic (Figure 10a and 10b). Greater water toxicity was observed in samples
from urban and agricultural sites relative to undeveloped ("other") sites (Figure 9a). The difference in water toxicity
between undeveloped and urban areas was highly statistically significant (p 0.0007); and the same is true for
the difference between undeveloped and agricultural areas (p <0.0001). Greater water toxicity was observed in
agriculture sites relative to urban sites (p < 0.0001). As discussed below, evidence suggests that water toxicity
in agriculture samples has largely been due to organophosphate pesticides (OPs). The greater water toxicity in
agriculture sites may reflect this, since organophosphate pesticide use has declined in urban settings in recent years.

Greater sediment toxicity was observed in samples from urban and agricultural sites to relative to undeveloped
sites (Figure 9b), and toxic sediments were found at greater percentages of sites with urban or agricultural land uses (Figure 10b). The difference in sediment toxicity (as mean survival) between undeveloped and urban areas was highly statistically significant (p < 0.0001). The difference in sediment toxicity between undeveloped and

effects. Toxicity tests are especially useful in
pollution monitoring because they can detect the effects of all chemicals (whether measured or not) as well as
pollutant mixtures. Two approaches are used to evaluate which chemicals are causing toxicity. Correlations analyses
provide insights on statistical relationships between contaminants and effects, and these data can be used to build
a weight of evidence for the cause of toxicity. Toxicity identification evaluations (TIEs) are laboratory procedures
designed to provide direct experimental evidence of specific chemicals causing toxicity. Results of both approaches
are provided below.

Causes of Water Toxicity

The vast majority of studies in California that have included TIE evidence have demonstrated that water toxicity
is caused by pesticides. These studies primarily have been conducted with two test species, the cladoceran

Ceriodaphnia dubia, and the amphipod Hyalella azteca. The first (published) ambient water TIE study conducted
in the United States used water samples from the Colusa Basin Drain, in Sacramento County. This study identified
methyl parathion, carbofuran, and malathion, pesticides associated with rice irrigation drainage, as the cause of
toxicity to C. dubia (Norberg-King et al., 1991). Subsequent studies conducted by researchers at the UC Davis
Aquatic Toxicology Laboratory (ATL) for the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board used TIEs with C.
dubia to document wide-spread toxicity from organophosphate pesticides in the Central Valley. The Central Valley
TIE studies were conducted in agriculture drainage ditches, urban creeks, on main stem sections of the Sacramento

and San Joaquin Rivers, and on tributaries to these rivers. This work is summarized in a review paper by de Vlaming
et al. (2000) and demonstrated the principal pesticides responsible for ambient toxicity in this region were diazinon
and chlorpyrifos. Toxicity was documented in both the dry season and rainy season and the majority of TIEs
identified these two OP pesticides as the cause of toxicity (de Vlaming et al., 2000). Additional studies conducted in urban creeks in the San Francisco Bay area and at various sites in the San Joaquin River watershed showed that there was sufficient diazinon and chlorpyrifos in these watersheds to account for observed toxicity to C. dubia, but no TIEs were conducted using these samples (de Vlaming et al., 2000). TIE evidence from the Central Valley monitoring led to additional monitoring and TIE studies in other agricultural areas of California. TIE studies using
samples from the Alamo River in the Imperial Valley demonstrated that toxicity to C. dubia was due to diazinon,
chlorpyrifos and carbofuran (de Vlaming et al., 2000). TIE studies in the Calleguas Creek watershed on the Oxnard Plain demonstrated that toxicity to C. dubia was due to diazinon and chlorpyrifos. Toxicity to fish (P. promelas) in this watershed was due to ammonia (Anderson et al., 2002). TIE studies in the Central Coast region also have
demonstrated that water toxicity to C. dubia is caused primarily by chlorpyrifos and diazinon. These include studies in the Salinas River and its tributaries (Anderson et al., et 2003a; Anderson et al., 2003b; Hunt et al., 2003; Phillips
et al., 2004), studies in the Pajaro River watershed (Hunt et al., 1999), and studies in the Santa Maria River and its tributaries (Anderson et al., 2006a; Anderson et al., 2010a; Phillips et al., 2010a).
In addition to TIE studies, the SWAMP statewide database evaluated for the current report was analyzed to determine
statistical correlations between C. dubia survival and selected pesticide concentrations. Pesticide concentrations were divided by their corresponding median lethal concentrations (LC50s) for toxicity to C. dubia to provide toxic units (TUs) for each chemical. Based on the TIE evidence, TUs for pyrethroid pesticides and the OP pesticides diazinon
and chlorpyrifos were calculated for all samples in which these pesticides were measured (n = 466). Pesticide
TUs were summed and regression analysis was conducted. The results demonstrate a highly significant negative relationship between summed TUs and C. dubia survival (p < 0.0001).

Use of the OP pesticides diazinon and chlorpyrifos has decreased in California since the mid-1990s. Further declines
have occurred in urban areas since U.S. EPA actions resulted in phase out of these two pesticides for residential
use in the early 2000s (Spurlock and Lee, 2008). While diazinon and chlorpyrifos are still used in agriculture, they
have been replaced by pyrethroids for most urban applications. The majority of pyrethroids used in California (90%)

surface water toxicity. As pyrethroid pesticides have increased in use there is growing evidence of sediment toxicity to the amphipod H. azteca due to these pesticides (see following discussion). Because this species is particularly
sensitive to pyrethroids and recent TIE studies have demonstrated water toxicity to H. azteca is due to pyrethroids,
it is being incorporated into water toxicity monitoring programs as an indicator for this class of pesticides. These
include studies in the New River in the Imperial Valley (Phillips et al., 2007), studies in various creeks in the Central
Valley, and in the American and San Joaquin Rivers (Weston and Lydy, 2010a, b), and a study in a the Sacramento- San Joaquin Delta in the northern San Francisco Estuary (Werner et al., 2010). Because H. azteca is considerably
more sensitive to pyrethroids than C. dubia, there is increasing interest in using both species in agriculture
water monitoring to account for mixtures of OP and pyrethroid pesticides. In addition, H. azteca is increasingly
being considered as a replacement for C. dubia in urban stormwater monitoring because of the increasing use of
pyrethroids in these settings.

No SWAMP studies to date have been specifically designed to determine whether changes in (urban) pesticide
use patterns from OP to pyrethroid pesticides have resulted in changes in toxicity patterns. This would require
continuous chemistry and toxicity monitoring at selected stations over the period before and after the residential
restrictions in OP use, and no peer-reviewed studies were designed to capture this pattern. In addition, pyrethroid
pesticides are toxic at very low concentrations. Analytical methods sufficient to quantify them at these low levels
were not sufficiently developed in the late 1990s and early 2000s, particularly in ambient water samples. Several
regional surface water monitoring studies provide data to illustrate how the change from OPS to pyrethroids in urban watersheds has resulted in changes in toxicity patterns. These include studies conducted in Bay Area urban
creeks and in the San Francisco Estuary by the San Francisco Estuary Institute's Regional Monitoring Program (Anderson et al., 2003c), and a total maximum daily load (TMDL) study in the Chollas Creek watershed in San Diego
(WestonSolutions, 2006, 2007). In addition, Johnson et al. (2010) modeled long-term trends showing reductions in
surface water concentrations of diazinon and chlorpyrifos in urban and agriculture streams in the California Central
Valley from the mid 1990s to 2005. Although no toxicity data was analyzed, diazinon concentrations in these Central
Valley watersheds were shown to be below the chronic toxicity threshold after implementation of the California
Central Valley TMDL for diazinon (Johnson et al., 2010). All three of these studies coincided with an increase in

either sediment and/or water toxicity in San Francisco, Chollas Creek, and Central Valley watersheds due
to pyrethroids.

While the preponderance of evidence shows that insecticides account for much of the water toxicity to freshwater
invertebrate test species in California, a few (unpublished) TIE studies also have shown toxicity due to other
contaminant classes. For example, testing with the green alga Selenastrum capricornutum has suggested herbicides
inhibited algal growth in the Susan River (Fong et al., 2006) and in the Sacramento River Delta (AquaScience, 2002).
In addition, TIE studies of stormwater toxicity in coastal receiving waters have shown toxicity due to zinc and copper
to marine invertebrates and fish larvae (Phillips et al., 2003; Schiff et al., 2006).

The SWAMP statewide database also was analyzed for correlations between algal growth (S. capricornutum) and selected chemicals in water, and between larval fish survival (P. promelas) and aqueous chemicals. There were
no significant negative correlations between total herbicides in water and S. capricornutum growth (p = 0.2528;
n 140), or between algal growth and nitrates in water (p = 0.4734; n = 169). Weak negative correlations were determined for larval fish survival and copper (p = 0.025; n = 151) and between larval fish survival and zinc (p
0.021; n = 151).

Causes of Sediment Toxicity

There are fewer examples of sediment TIEs conducted in California. This is due to the fact that there is is a longer
history of water toxicity monitoring in this state, and because sediment TIE methods have only recently been
sufficiently developed for routine use. Sediment TIEs using H. azteca have been conducted in most regions of California where toxicity has been observed. As discussed above, the majority of these studies have demonstrated
that sediment toxicity is due to pyrethroid pesticides. Other studies have shown sediment toxicity is due to the
OP pesticide chlorpyrifos, or to mixtures of chlorpyrifos and pyrethroids. The majority of these studies have been conducted in the Central Valley and on the Central Coast. Sediment TIEs conducted in the Santa Maria River and its
estuary demonstrated that toxicity to H. azteca was due to mixtures of chlorpyrifos and the pyrethroids cypermethrin
and cyhalothrin (Anderson et al., 2006a; Anderson et al., 2010a; Phillips et al., 2010a). TIEs conducted in the Salinas
River watershed have also reported sediment toxicity is due to the pyrethroids cyhalothrin and cypermethrin, and
in some cases, the OP pesticide chlorpyrifos (Weston and Amweg, 2007; Anderson et al., 2008; Hunt et al., 2008).
Studies conducted in the Central Valley have found the pyrethroid bifenthrin is largely responsible for toxicity to H.

azteca, but toxicity also has been due to mixtures of bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, and cyhalothrin (Weston and Amweg,
2007; Anderson et al., 2008; Weston et al., 2008).

Holmes et al. (2008) conducted statewide monitoring of sediment toxicity associated with pyrethroids in 30 urban creeks, and found pyrethroids pesticide concentrations were sufficient to account for the observed toxicity
in the water bodies tested. Four of these creeks were selected for TIE studies, and Phillips et al. (Phillips et al.,
2010b) reported toxicity in the three southern California creeks was due to mixtures of bifenthrin, cyfluthrin and
cypermethrin. Sediment toxicity in Marsh Creek, a tributary to the Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta, also was due to these same pyrethroids (Phillips et al., 2010b). There have also been numerous other studies that presented toxicity and chemical evidence of pyrethroid-associated sediment toxicity without TIEs. In addition to Holmes et al. (2008), these include studies in the Central Valley by Weston et al. (2004) and studies by Amweg et al. (2006) in Kirker
Creek and other urban creeks in the eastern San Francisco Bay area.

In addition to TIE studies, the SWAMP statewide database also was analyzed to determine statistical correlations
between H. azteca survival in sediments and selected pesticide concentrations. As discussed above, pesticide concentrations were divided by their corresponding LC50s for toxicity to H. azteca to provide Toxic Units (TUs) for
each chemical. Based on the TIE evidence, TUs for pyrethroid pesticides and the OP pesticide chlorpyrifos were
calculated for all samples in which these pesticides were measured (n = 185). For this analysis, the sediment
pesticide concentrations were normalized to the total organic carbon content in the sediment because this has been
shown to effect chemical bioavailability. Bioavailability refers to the capacity of chemicals to cross cell membranes
and therefore cause toxicity. Studies have shown that the organic carbon content in sediments in is a good predictor of
organic chemical bioavailability and toxicity. Pesticide TUs were summed and the correlation was evaluated using

the Spearman Rank Sum procedure. The results demonstrate highly significant negative relationship between
summed pyrethroid and chlorpyrifos TUs and H. azteca survival (p = 0.0077).

Table 2 summarizes dozens of studies in which TIEs have identified the causes of toxicity in ambient water and
sediment samples from California, from 1991 to the present. With the exception of ammonia, all of these ambient
TIEs implicated pesticides, primarily OPs and, more recently, pyrethroids. It is important to note that pesticides are
implicated in streams draining residential and urban areas as well as agricultural land.

Note that the likelihood of conducting a successful TIE increases with increasing magnitude of toxicity in a particular sample. As a result, more TIEs were conducted using C dubia because the magnitude of toxicity was greater with this species than to fathead minnows (P. promelas). This may skew the evaluation of what causes toxicity since for the most part there were few TIEs conducted on the fish.

WHAT ARE THE ECOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF AQUATIC TOXICITY?

The principal approach to determine whether observations of toxicity in laboratory toxicity tests are indicative
of ecological impacts is to conduct field bioassessments. Bioassessment is the characterization of environmental
conditions through the use of biological organisms. Bioassessments may be conducted using a variety of different
ecological communities ranging from periphyton to fish communities, but the most commonly used method

Toxicity in California Waters

assesses impacts on macroinvertebrate communities. These studies
are most informative when toxicity, chemistry and macroinvertebrate
bioassessments are conducted at the same time and place, and these are
referred to as "triad" studies because they involve three lines of evidence.
Based on the findings of recent national workshops convened to evaluate
indicators for water quality monitoring, programs that include chemistry,
toxicity testing, bioassessments and bioaccumulation studies provide
the most robust measures of environmental quality (Grothe et al., 1996;
Ingersoll et al., 1997). These core indicators form the backbone of current
SWAMP monitoring in California.

Because distributions of freshwater insects and other macroinvertebrates
are influenced by habitat, water temperature, sedimentation, and
numerous other non-chemical "stressors", the most comprehensive
studies include characterizations of all factors which may influence
their ecology. While there are a limited number of studies focused on
California waters in the published literature, there is large international
body of evidence showing pesticides and other chemicals are linked to
impacts on aquatic ecosystems, and these include microcosm and field
studies. A review article by Schulz (2004) includes many of these papers. The influence of
One of the most comprehensive series of studies linking water and
sediment toxicity with impacts on resident macroinvertebrates in California habitat quality on
was conducted in the Salinas River. In these studies, water and sediment
toxicity was caused by diazinon and chlorpyrifos from agriculture runoff macroinvertebrates was
(Anderson et al., 2003a; Anderson et al., 2003b; Phillips et al., 2004).
Bioassessments showed macroinvertebrate densities declined downstream also assessed and it was

study demonstrated that Procloeon were sensitive to chlorpyrifos at
concentrations found in the river, and that this species was not influenced a less important factor
by suspended particles (Anderson et al., 2006b). The influence of habitat
quality on macroinvertebrates was also assessed and it was concluded that than pesticides
habitat was a less important factor than pesticides (Anderson et al., 2003b).
A similar series of studies were conducted on the lower Santa Maria River. Toxicity studies and TIEs showed toxicity
in the Santa Maria River was caused by mixtures of chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and pyrethroids (Anderson et al., 2006a;
Phillips et al., 2006), and stations with the greatest contamination and toxicity also had the lowest macroinvertebrate
densities. Because the amphipod H. azteca occurs naturally in freshwater systems throughout the central coast
of California and is a standard toxicity test species, disappearance of these amphipods at the most toxic stations
provides a key linkage between laboratory toxicity and field impacts. Subsequent studies in the Santa Maria River
Estuary have demonstrated that water and sediment toxicity due to OP and pyrethroid pesticides extend into this

estuary (Anderson et al., 2010a; Phillips et al., 2010a). Stations with the greatest contamination in this estuary also have the lowest macroinvertebrate densities, have lower numbers of amphipods, and higher numbers of pollution-
tolerant species (Anderson et al., 2010a).

There is growing evidence that pyrethroids in coastal urban creeks may accumulate to toxic concentrations in
nearshore marine systems. Holmes et al. (2008) found toxicity to H. azteca at a number of urban creeks in southern
California including Switzer Creek in San Diego County, Peters Canyon Wash in the San Diego Creek watershed in
Orange County, and Ballona Creek in Los Angeles County. Additional studies in San Diego Harbor (Anderson et al.,
2005; Anderson et al., 2010b), Upper Newport Bay and the San Diego Creek watershed (Bay et al., 2005; Anderson et al., 2007; Ranasinghe et al., 2007; Phillips et al., 2010b), and the Ballona Creek Estuary (Bay et al., 2005; Ranasinghe
et al., 2007; Lao et al., 2010) have shown persistent sediment toxicity, TIE evidence of toxicity due to pyrethroids,
and degradation of marine infaunal communities in these receiving systems. Future monitoring should emphasize
these important coastal habitats.

Additional triad investigations linking chemistry, toxicity, and macroinvertebrate bioassessments have been conducted in urban and agriculture-dominated creeks in the Central Valley. Weston et al. (2005) conducted
bioassessments in Pleasant Grove Creek in the Roseville area of Sacramento. These authors found declines in
densities of H. azteca in sections of the creeks that are toxic to this amphipod in laboratory tests. Synoptic chemistry showed several pyrethroids, including bifenthrin, exceeded toxicity thresholds to H. azteca. However, Hall et
al. (2009) conducted additional assessments in Pleasant Grove Creek and Kirker Creek, in study areas that had
previously demonstrated toxicity ascribed to pyrethroids. These authors concluded that physical habitat played a
larger role in macroinvertebrate distributions than chemical contaminants. Hall et al. (2007) also used statistical
analyses to investigate the relationships between farm level pesticide use and physical habitat metrics on benthic macroinvertebrate communities in Orestimba Creek. This creek has been the subject of previous Regional Water Board studies indicating water and sediment toxicity to pyrethroid and OP pesticides. Benthic macroinvertebrate
densities and distributions varied widely in this system, and Hall et al. (2007) concluded that there were only
weak statistical associations between benthic communities and pesticide applications and between benthos and
physical habitat.

These authors found declines in
densities of H. azteca in sections
of the creeks that are toxic to this
amphipod in laboratory tests.

HOW DO TOXICITY TEST RESULTS COMPARE WHEN DIFFERENT STATISTICAL METHODS ARE APPLIED, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO USE OF THE EPA TEST OF SIGNIFICANT TOXICITY (TST)?

State Water Board staff is developing, for Board consideration, a Policy for Toxicity Assessment and Control
to establish numeric water quality objectives for toxicity. The proposed policy includes numeric water quality
objectives for chronic and acute toxicity, a prescribed statistical methodology for determining whether a sample
is toxic that is based on the U.S. EPA's Test of Significant Toxicity (TST), monitoring requirements for wastewater,
and recommendations for monitoring stormwater and some non-point source discharges. The TST also would be applicable to monitoring conducted by SWAMP so this assessment was conducted using the TST.

In toxicity testing of ambient or stormwater samples, a single sample (e.g., ambient water) often is compared to a
laboratory control. In these tests, the objective is to determine if given sample of site water is toxic, as indicated by
a significantly different organism response compared to the control using a t-test or similar statistic. To demonstrate
the TST approach for ambient toxicity programs, U.S. EPA compiled SWAMP data from 409 chronic tests for C. dubia
(crustacean) and 256 chronic tests for P. promelas (fish) to compare results of the two statistical approaches. The following data are from the U.S. EPA TST Technical Document (U.S. EPA, 2010).

Table 3 summarizes results of C. dubia tests analyzed with an a = 0.20 for the TST test method. Although the
majority (92%) of these comparisons resulted in the same decision using either the TST or the t-test approach,
approximately 6 percent of the tests (24 tests) would have been declared not toxic using the traditional t-test
approach when the TST would declare them toxic. In addition, 2 percent of the tests (7 tests) would have been
declared toxic using the t-test approach when the TST would not indicate toxicity.

Table 3 Comparison of results of chronic C. dubia ambient toxicity tests C. using the TST approach and the traditional (t-test) analysis. For the TST approach a = 0.20 and b value = 0.75. For the t-test approach a = 0.05.

The two approaches agree 92% of the time. EPA Test of Significant Toxicity
Toxic Non-Toxic

Traditional (t-test) Toxic 20% 2%
Non-Toxic 6% 72%

This analysis indicates there is little difference in the assessment of ambient toxicity regardless of which statistical method is applied to the data. The value of utilizing the TST methodology is that it can be applied to all ambient and effluent toxicity monitoring improving consistency and comparability among all Water Board monitoring programs.

WHAT MANAGEMENT INITIATIVES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE TOXICITY ASSOCIATED WITH CONTAMINANTS IN SURFACE WATERS?

Evidence suggests that pesticides are the most common cause of acute surface water toxicity in California, therefore
initiatives that reduce agricultural and urban sources of pesticides should improve water quality. The primary
regulatory mechanism for reducing pesticide loading in urban and in agriculture watersheds in California is the
development and implementation of a TMDL. A TMDL must be developed when a water body is listed as impaired
per section 303 (d) of the Federal Clean Water Act (see: http://www.swrcb.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/tmdl/, for TMDLs listed by region). There are several examples where the combination of U.S. EPA use changes and TMDLs for the pesticides diazinon and chlorpyrifos have resulted in significant reductions in loadings of these pesticides.
These include use restrictions and TMDLs discussed above in the California Central Valley, and the Chollas Creek watershed. More recent pesticide TMDLs include those that have been, or are being implemented in the Calleguas Creek, Salinas River, and Santa Maria River Watersheds, and in the San Diego Creek watershed in
Southern California.

Through implementation of TMDLs and label changes on use of specific agricultural pesticides, their occurrence
in runoff should be reduced. For example, in July of 2006, the USEPA published the Re-registration Eligibility
Decision (RED) for diazinon (http://www.epa.gov/oppsrrd1/reregistration/REDs/diazinon_red.pdf)which reduced
the number and pounds of application of this pesticide for crops such as lettuce, strawberries, and broccoli.
This RED requires that products sold after 2009 contain the new use guidance. A recent analysis of pesticide use
data in Monterey County shows reduced use of diazinon after 2009, and increased use of malathion (personal communication, L. Harlan Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board). It is too soon to determine how these changes affect surface water quality.

U.S. EPA and the California Department of Pesticide Regulation (CDPR) have initiated reviews of pyrethroid
pesticides registrations (Spurlock and Lee, 2008). CDPR currently is developing use restrictions for pyrethroid
pesticides used by pest control businesses in urban settings (for public comment August, 2011; Personal
Communication, John Sanders, California DPR). CDPR also plans on following urban restrictions with regulations to
address agricultural use of pesticides affecting surface water quality in 2012 (Personal communication, John Sanders,

The primary regulatory mechanism
for reducing pesticide loading in
urban and agriculture watersheds
in California is the development and
implementation of a TMDL. a

CDPR). The U.S. EPA also is requiring label changes for pyrethroid products to reduce their impact on surface water
quality (http://www.regulations.gov/#!documentDetail;D = EPA-HQ-OPP-2008-0331-0021). In addition to restrictions
on pounds of active ingredients applied per acre and number of applications per crop, use restrictions typically involve recommendations for vegetated buffer zones and setbacks to limit the potential for off-field transport of
pesticides in spray drift, irrigation and stormwater runoff.

In addition to pesticide use restrictions, numerous state, regional and local programs are intended to reduce urban
and agricultural contaminant runoff through implementation of various management practices. In urban settings
these include incorporation of low impact development (LID) techniques to curb runoff and sequester contaminants, increased urban street sweeping to reduce total suspended solids in stormwater, and homeowner education programs to increase public awareness about water and biocide use. In agriculture settings management practices include use
of integrated pest management techniques, efficient irrigation systems, setbacks, treatment wetlands and vegetated
treatment systems to reduce pesticide and nutrient loading in runoff. Recent research also has demonstrated that
incorporation of hydrolytic enzymes in integrated vegetated treatment systems work to detoxify organophosphate
pesticides in agricultural runoff (Anderson et al., 2011). Similar enzymes systems currently are being developed for pyrethroid detoxification by the Australian government.

As the combination of management initiatives described above are implemented throughout California, continued
monitoring will be necessary to document how well they reduce contamination and toxicity in State waters. For
example, SWAMP's Stream Pollution Trends (SPoT) monitoring program is designed to detect long-term changes in
contamination and sediment toxicity on a watershed scale. This program is uniquely positioned to document how
management actions affect contamination and sediment toxicity state-wide. Coordination of SWAMP's regional and
statewide monitoring programs with regional stormwater and agriculture cooperative monitoring programs and other
state and federal agency monitoring will allow for more efficient use of resources and greater watershed coverage.

SECTION
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS -

Toxicity in California surface waters is widespread and evidence suggests it's. largely due to
pesticides.
Increasing evidence of pyrethroid toxicity in water suggests the need for more water testing
with the amphipod Hyalella azteca.
Data from the SWAMP regional and statewide monitoring programs should be useful in
detecting changes in toxicity patterns over larger spatial and temporal scales. There is need
for consistency in monitoring to capture emerging trends.
The State Water Board should require replicate-level toxicity data be entered into or available
for exchange through the California Environmental Data Exchange Network (CEDEN).
The SWAMP regional and statewide monitoring needs to be better coordinated with other monitoring programs as appropriate (e.g., stormwater and other NPDES monitoring, Irrigated
Lands Regulatory Program, CDPR, National Water-Quality Assessment Program (NAWQA)).
More TIEs with fish and algae are needed to identify the cause of toxicity to these indicators.
Linkage of toxicity, chemistry, and bioassessment monitoring programs would help strengthen
the weight of evidence of ecological impacts from toxic pollutants.
The SWAMP should consider implementing a statewide water column toxicity monitoring
program to complement the existing statewide sediment toxicity monitoring program. Such a program would provide an unbiased, consistent assessment of water column toxicity
throughout the state.

DATA QUALITY OBJECTIVES CO
FOR THIS ASSESSMENT

Comparability and data sources for this analysis: This analysis was able to leverage data
collected by SWAMP Regional and Statewide monitoring programs, as well as by partner
programs. This was possible because SWAMP established a systematic structure to document
and evaluate data comparability. This structure gives data users the ability to quickly
combine data from multiple sources to perform integrated assessments. The SWAMP Quality Assurance Program instituted standards for data quality and its verification while the SWAMP
Data Management Program developed data formats, transfer protocols, and the California
Environmental Data Exchange Network.

Statewide survey: Data were pooled from multiple sources to create the data set used in this
statewide survey. The quality objective for data usability and comparability among data batches
was defined as follows: data batches were usable for this analysis if toxicity test controls met test
acceptability criteria as set by the test protocols. Other quality control and metadata information
were not considered germane to the goals of this report. Data from multiple test protocols
(indicator organisms) measured at multiple laboratories were integrated into a single data set for
analysis. All toxicity test data were re-analyzed using the USEPA Test of Significant Toxicity to
ensure that every toxicity test result conformed to a consistent statistical analysis (USEPA 2010,
et Denton et al 2011).

Threshold development: Thresholds for distinguishing between moderate toxicity and high toxicity
were developed using data from multiple laboratories for all toxicity endpoints presented in this
analysis. For this purpose, the quality objective for data usability and comparability among data
batches was defined as follows: data batches were used only if classified as "SWAMP-Compliant."
Data classified as "SWAMP-Compliant" has been verified to meet all measurement quality objectives and requirements as defined in the 2002 SWAMP Quality Assurance Management Plan
or the 2008 SWAMP Quality Assurance Program Plan.

DATA SOURCES FOR THIS ASSESSMENT

The sources listed are for the data currently available in CEDEN. Many other studies by the State
Board, the Regional Boards, and partner programs have been conducted but are not considered
here. Many of those data sets will be entered into CEDEN as time and funding allow.

METHODS USED TO ASSESS HOW THE RESULTS OF TOXICITY MEASUREMENTS COMPARE AMONG WATERS DRAINING URBAN, AGRICULTURAL, AND OTHER LAND COVER AREAS

Land use was quantified around stream, canal and ditch sites at which samples were collected for testing in water
column or sediment toxicity tests. Using ArcGIS, polygons were drawn to circumscribe the area within one kilometer of each site that was upstream of the site, in the same catchment, and within 500 meters of a waterway draining to the site. Land use was categorized according to the National Land Cover Database. All "developed" land types in the land cover database were collectively categorized as "urban". "Cultivated crops" and "hay/pasture" were categorized together as "agricultural". All other land types were categorized as "other" for the purposes of this analysis. Percentages of each land use type were quantified in the buffers surrounding the sample collection sites.
Urban land category represents sites with nearby upstream land use of greater than 10% urban areas and less than 25% agricultural areas.

Agricultural land category represents sites with nearby upstream land use of greater than 25% agricultural areas and less than 10% urban areas.

Results of toxicity bioassays were summarized by site as the minimum test organism performance seen for any test
species in a given matrix over all toxicity tests performed with samples from a given site.

Toxicity in California Waters

Is any sample from the Site is coded green:
site toxic*? Non-toxic

YES

Is any sample from the site
more toxic than the high toxicity Site is coded yellow:
threshold**? Some significant toxicity

YES

Is the mean for all samples
from the site more toxic than Site is coded orange:
the high toxicity threshold? Moderate toxicity

YES NOTE:

"Toxic" indicates that survival or algal growth in a sample is not signiticantly higher than the toxic threshold using the EPA Test of Significant Toxicity.
Site is coded red: #* High toxicity thresholds specific to each test endpoint
High toxicity were calculated using a method developed for sediment quality evaluation (Bay et al., 2007).

Figure 11. Site categorization process. The process used to characterize the magnitude of toxicity each site was designed to take into consideration the widely varying number of samples and test endpoints (such as fish or crustacean survival) among sites. If any toxic samples were measured for a site, the site was categorized based on the most sensitive endpoint. This process considers both individual sample results and the mean results for sites with multiple samples. Relative to the impaired waterbody listing process, a site coded 'green" would not be listed for toxicity. Sites coded "yellow* to "red" would be listed if the number of toxic samples met the criteria outlined in the State Water Board's Listing and De-listing Policy.

28 L Introduction and Procedural Background
This is one of two independent cases involving the issuance of wastewater discharge requirements,
which serve as a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, to the. Sacramento Regional

RULING ON SUBMITTED MATTER CASE NO. 34-2013-80001358-CU-WM-GDS

1 County Sanitation District (SRCSD). The permit allows for the discharge of treated wastewater from the
Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant into the Sacramento River.

The California Regional Water Quality Control Board, Central Valley Region (Regional Board),
issued the permit on December 9, 2010, through its Order No. R5-2010-0114. The permit essentially was
5
d renewal of a permit previously issued in 2000. On January 5, 2011, the California Sportfishing
Protection Alliance (CSPA, the petiioner in this case), filed a timely petition for review with the
California State Water Resources Control Board (State Board) pursuant to Water Code section 13320.
SRCSD also filed a timely petition for review with the State Board.
The State Board consolidated the two petitions for review on March 28, 201l. Nearly six months 10

11 later, on September 19, 2011, the State Board notified CSPA and SRCSD that it would review the permit

12 on its own motion.

13 SRCSD filed petition for writ of mandate in this Court on December 30, 2011, entitied

14 Sacramento Regional County Sanitation Disirici v. State Water Resources Conirol Board, Case No. 34.

15 2011-80001028. That writ proceeding subsequently was stayed by stipulation of the parties and an order

16 of the Court entered on January 23, 2012.'

17 On December 4, 2012, the State Board issued Order No. WQ-2012-0013, which approved an
18 amended permit and essentially dismissed the issues that CSPA had ralsed in its petition for review.

19 CSPA filed the present writ proceeding on January 3, 2013. The Regional Board and the State

20 Board have filed a joint opposition brief to the petition. SRCSD, named as the real party in interest, also
21 has filed an opposition brief. The Central Valley Clean Water Association (CVCWA), which previously
22 was granted leave to intervene in this case, also has filed an opposition brief.
23 Respondent Board lodged an extensive administrative record with the Court, consisting of
24

25 / On May 27, 2014, the parties in SRCSD's writ proceeding filed a Stipulation and Proposed Order in thai case indicating that they had reached agreement regarding the remaining issues in that procecding. However, final 26 resolution of the case was dependent upon "the occurrence or non-occurrence of certain events over the next few months.' The Stipulation and Order thus provides for a hearing In on the merits In that case on December 12, 2014 If 27 certain events described as "triggering dismissal" have not occurred by September 15, 2014. This proceeding has not been stayed, and no party in this proceeding has essented that the issues in this proceeding are related to the issues in 28 SRCSD's writ proceeding.

documents from the Regional Board's proccedings (numbered RB000001-RB182548) and from the State
Board's proceedings (numbered SB0000|-SB06788).3

3 The Court heard oral argument in this matter on April 11, 2014. At the close of the bearing, the

4 Court granted respondents* unopposed oral motion to dismiss the State Board with prejudice.' The Court
5 also directed the parties to fite supplemental briefing on specified issues. The Court received the
6 supplemental briofing and the matter was deemed submitted as of May 22, 2014.
7 Il. Summary of Petitioner's Contentions and Court's Ruling
8 Petitioner CSPA makes six discrete contentions in this proceeding, which may be summarized as
^9=02 follows:

I. Respondent Board failed to include freshwater aquatic life criteria for hardness-dependent
metals in the permit that were calculated in the manner required by applicable regulatory law.
2. Respondent Board failed to evaluate the additive or interactive toxicity of multiple pollutants
as required under the applicable Basin Plan.

15 3. Respondent Board failed to impose an adequate effluent limication for aluminum.

16 4. Respondent Board failed to establish a weekly effluent limitation for aluminum as required by I

17 applicable regulatory law.

18 5. Respondent Board granted SRCSD an exemption from the applicable Thermal Plan that is not

19 supported by the evidence regarding potential harm to aquatic life.

20 6. Respondent Board failed to include mass-based effluent limitations as required by applicable
21 regulatory law.4
22 For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants the petition as lo issues 1,4 and 5, and denies the
23 petition as to issues 2, 3 and 6,

IXI. Standard of Review

All parties agrco that Water Code section 13330(e) governs the standard of review applicable to
this proceeding. The statute provides: "Except as otherwise provided herein, Section 1094.5 of the Code
of Civil Procedure shall govern proceedings for which petitions are filed pursuant to this section. For the
purposes of subdivision (c) of Section 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the court shall exercise its
independent judgment on the evidence in any case involving the judicial review of a decision or order of
the state board issued under Section 13320, or a deoision or order of a regional board for which the state

board denies review under Section 13320, other than a decision or order issued under Section 13323."
in As provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5(b), the Court's inquiry "...shall extend to
10
the questions whether the respondent has proceeded without, or in excess of, jurisdiction; whether there 11

12 was a fuir trial; and whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion. Abuse of discretion is

13 established iF the respondent has not proceeded in the manner required by law; the order or decision is not

14 supported by the findings; or the findings are not supported by the evidence."

15 Because the Court is authorized by law to exercise its independent judgment on the evidence in

16 this case, Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5(c) provides that "...abuse of discretion is established if

17 the court determines that the findings are not supported by the weight of the evidence."

18 The standard of review applicable to issues of law is also independent judgment, giving deference

19 to the determination of the agency appropriate to the circumstances of agency action. (See, Yamaha

20 Corporation of America v. State Board of Equalization (1998) 19 Cal. 4th 1, 8.) The court should extend

21 appropriate deference to the lechnical expertise of administrative agencies, and give considerable weight to

22 the findings of experienced administrative bodies made after a full and formal hearing, especially in cases
23 involving technical and scientific evidence, (See, Communities for a Better Environment v. State Water
24 Resources Control Board (2003) 109 Cal. App. 41h 1089, 1103-1104.)
25 The findings of the respondent come before the court with strong presumption of their
26 correctness, and the burden rests on the complaining party to convince the court that its decision is
27 to contrary to the weight of the evidence. (See, Fukuda v. City of Angels (1999) 20 Cal. App. 41h 805, 812.)

1 IV. Discussion

2 A. Hardness-Dependent Metals Criteria

Petitioner's first contention is that respondent Board prejudicially abused its discretion by failing
4 to calculate freshwater aquatic life criteria for hardness-dependent metals in the manner required by law.
5 The permit in this case regulates seven hardness-dependent metals: cadmium, copper, chromium III, lead,
6 nickel, silver and zino.3
7 All parties agree that the establishment of water quality criteria for hardness-dependent metals is
8 governed by a regulation promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) commonly

10 referred to as the "California Toxics Rule" (CTR). The CTR is found in Title 40 of the Code of Federal

f1 Regulations, Part 131, § 131.38, formally entitled "Establishment of Numeric Criteria for Priority Toxic

12 Pollutants for the State of California" 6

13 The CTR applies to numerous pollutants that can cause toxicity to aquatic life organisms when
14 present in sufficiently high concentrations. For most of those pollutants, the CTR sets forth criteria in the

15 form of specific numerical values.' However, "[f]reshwater aquatic life criteria for certain metals are

16 expressed as a function of hardness because hardness and/or water quality characteristics that are usually

17 correlated with hardness can reduce or increase the toxicities of some metals, […} Increasing hardness

18 has the effect of decreasing the toxicity of metals. Water quality criteria to protect aquatic life may be
19 calculated at different concentrations of hardnesses measured in milligrams per liter (mg/l) as calcium
20 carbonate (CaCOj).n*
21 In other words, for a number of hardness-dependent metals, the criteria set forth in the regulation
22 must be adjusted for hardness to match the circumstances of the particular regulated discharge. Section
23 131.38(b)(2) of the CTR presents two hardness-dependent equations for freshwater metals criteria.'
24

25 See, RB0072396.

CASE NO. 34-20(3-80001358-CU-WM-GDS

2 The first of the two equations addresses calculation of the "Criteria Maximum Concentration"

W (CMC), which is defined as "the water quality criteria to protect against acute effects in aquatic tife and is
the highest instream concentration of a priority toxic pollutant consisting of a short-term average not 1o be

5 exceeded more than once every three years on the average,"I0

6 The second of the two equations addresses calculation of the "Continuous Criteria Concentration"

7 (CCC), which is defined as "the water quality criteria to protect against chronic effects in aquatic life and
is the highest in stream [sic] concentration of a priority toxio pollutant consisting of a 4-day average not to
be excecded more than once every three years on the average."

10 Each equation includes a factor for hardness. Section 131.38(cX(4) contains directions as to how

12 to establish this factor. it states: "For purposes of calculating freshwater aquatic life criteria for metals

13 from the equations in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, for waters with a hardness of 400 mg/lor less As

14 calcium carbonate, the actual ambient hardness of the surface water shall be used in those equations.»12

15 In the permit, respondent Board divided the analysis of hardness-dependent metals into two parts:

16 one for so-called "concave down metals" (chronic cadmium, chromium Ill, copper, nickel and zinc); and

17 one for so-called "concave up metals" (acute cadmium, lead and acute silver)." "Concave down" and

[8 "concave up" are not terms used in the CTR, but are apparently well-accepted shorthand terms that

19 describe the curves that result when the equations for various metals are plotted on a graph. "*

20 In Petitioner contends that respondent Board faited to follow the mandate of the CTR in this analysis.

21 the case of "concave down" metals, petitioner argues, respondent Board erred by using the hardness of

22 the treatment plant's effuent in the equation set forth in Section 131.38(b)(2), rather than the "actual

23

24 ambient hardness of the surface water", i.e., the hardness of the river upstream from the point at which

25 effluent enters the river. In the case of "concave up" metals, petitioner argues, respondent Board erred in

two ways: by using an equation other than the equation specified in Section 131.38(b)(2); and by using the

2 hardness of the efflucnt in that equation in addition to the hardness of the upstream water in the river.
It is apparent from the face of the permit that respondent Board did perform the calculations as
petitioner contends.1 Indeed, no party asserts otherwise.
5 With regard to the calculation for "concave up" metals, the Court is compelled to conclude that
6 respondent Board abused its discretion by failing to use the equation set forth in the applicable regulation.
7 The regulation clearly sets forth the equations to be used. It is undisputed that respondent Board did not
8 use the required equation for "concave up" metals, and therefore did not comply with the law. The failure
9 to proceed in the manner required by law is, by definition, an abuse of discretion under Code of Civil
10
Procedure section 1094.5(b).
11

12 A writ of mandate therefore will issue directing respondent Board to recalculate water quality

13 criteria for "concave up" hardness-dependent metals using the equations set forth in the CTR.

14 The remaining issue is the use of the hardness value of the effluent as one of the elements in the

15 calculation for all hardness-dependent metals.

16 For purposes of this case, it is undisputed that the hardness of the Sacramento River is less than

17 400 mg/L as calcium carbonate.16 Thus, respondent Board was required to use the "actual ambient

18 hardness of the surface water" in calculating froshwater aquatic life criteria for hardness-dependent metals

19 through the equations set out in the CTR. The dispute in this case centers on the meaning of that term.

20 The Court concludes that, under the facts and circumstances of this case, respondent Board abused
21 its discretion by using the hardness value of the effluent in its calculations. The regulation requires the
22 Board to use the actual ambient hardness valve of the "surface water". The regulation does not define that
23 term, but the ordinary meaning of the term "surface water" suggests a body of water of natural origin that
24

25 IS See, RB0072399-72404.
1 Sce, for example, real party in interest SRCSD's opposition brief, page 11, footnote 9; "The equations present in 26 the CTR are considered to be most accurate when the hardness values of the ambient waters are between 25 mg/l and 400 mg/l of hardness, [...] There is no dispute that the Sacramento River falls within this range and that the 27 hardness-dependent equations are therefore applicable." The permit itself states that "upstream receiving water hardness varled from 26 mg/L to 100 mg/L. (as CaCO3), based on 100 samples from June 2005 to July 2008." to (See,
28 RB0072399). Sampling data in the record supports this statcment. (See, RB0009857-9863.)

1 is present on the surface of the earth, such as a river, a lake, a bay or an estuary, rather than treated waste

2 water that is discharged into such waters. The regulation itself supports this interpretation by including the
term "surface waters" in its introductory description of the types of water bodies it is intended to protect."
4 Thus, the regulation highlights a fundamental distinction between "surface water" (which is to be
5 protected) and "effluent" (which is to be regulated),
6 Similarly, the ordinary meaning of "effluent", as used in the context of wastewater treatment
plants, is "waste material...discharged into the environment"lt, i.e., something distinct from the waters
8 into which the effluent is discharged (which represent the environment). Moreover, in this case, at least,
9 the effluent from SRCSD's treatment plant may not reasonably be characterized factually as "surface 10

11 water" because it does not originate naturally or flow on the surface. Instead, it is produced by the

12 treatment plant and transported through a system of pipes to be discharged into the river from a submerged io

diffuser.
13

14 The conclusion that the effluent is not surface water for purposes of the regulation is supported by

15 the State Board's "Policy for Implementation of Toxics Standards for Inland Surface Waters, Enclosed

16 Bays, and Estuaries of California", issued in 2005.1% It states: "When implementing the provisions of this

17 Policy, the RWQCB shall ensure that criteria/objectives are property adjusted for hardness or pH, if

18 applicable, using the hardness or pH values for the receiving water" ã0 The use of the term "receiving

19 water" clearly indicates that the State Board interprets the regulatory term "surface water" as meaning the

20 water into which the effluent is discharged, and not the effluent itself. This Interpretation of the applicable
21 regulation by the agency charged with supervising its administration is entitled to significant weight as an
22 official interpretation of the applicable regulation, (See, Californians for Pesticide Reform v. Depurtment
23

24 11 Sce, Section 131.38(a): "Scope. This section promulgates criteria for priority toxic pollutants in the State of Catifomia for inland surface waters and cnclosed bays and estuaries." (Italics in original.) Similarly, the
25 introductory "Overview" to the regulation states: "Control of toxic pollutants in surface waters is necessary to achieve the CWA's goals and objectives. Many of California's monitored river miles, lake acres and estuarine
26 waters have elevated levels of toxic pollutants." (See, RB0058498.)
18 See, e.g., Webster's Ninth New Coltegiate Dictionary, "effluent", definition 2b. 27 19 The Policy is frequemly referred to as the "State Implementation Plan" or "SIP",

4 Respondent Board, supported by SRCSD and CVCWA, argues that it has considerable discretion

5 in selecting the hardness value to be used in the hardness-dependent metals calculations, and that selecting

6 the hardness value of the effluent in this case was within the scope of that discretion. This argument fails

7 to persuade, principally because the hardness value of the effluent is not the "actual ambient hardness of

8 the surface water", as the regulation requires.
The argument that respondent Board has discretion to use the hardness value of the effluent is

10 based in part on a decision of the State Water Resources Control Board issued in 2008 and referred to as

11 the "City of Davis Order" 21 The Order does state, as a general proposition, that the CTR and the State

12 Implementation Plan are "somewhat conflicting for selection of hardness", and that, as a result, "the

13 regional water boards have considerable discretion in the selection of hardness."22 But the Order does not

14 stand for the proposition that the regional water boards have discretion to select effluent hardness as a

15 factor in the regulatory equations. Indeed, the Order did not endorse or even discuss the use of effluent

16 hardness values in calculating effluent limitations in that particular case. Instead, the Order concluded that -P-

17

18 the Regional Board "was justified in using upstream receiving water hardness values rather than effluent

19 hardness values", citing the overriding principle that "[e]Muent limitations must protect beneficial uses

20 considering reasonable, worst-case conditions",» At most, the Order suggested that the Regionaf Board,

21 on remand, could admit and consider supplemental evidence, including "representative downstream

22 recciving water mixed hardness data".24 This falls short of authorizing respondent Board's use of effluent
hardness in this case, or any other.

Court supports respondent Board's approach to hardness-dependent metals in this case: California
2 Sportfishing Protection Alliance v. Califarnia Regional Water Quality Control Board, Central Valley
3 Region, Sacramento County Superior Court Case No. 34-2009-80000309.25 Indeed, SRCSD goes so far as
to contend that petitioner is collaterally estopped from litigating issues regarding hardness-dependent
metals in this case because it was : to party to the earlier action and the issue presented here was resolved
adversely to petitioner there.26
Neither contention is persuasive, because the facts of the Deer Creek case were significantly
different from the facts of this case. Specifically, Deer Creek is a stream of highly variable flow that
"..is, under dry conditions, an effluent dominated stream", in which "the 'worst-case' downstream
10

11 hardness happens to be the same as the effluent hardness. "27 In other words, under certain regularly-

12 occurring dry conditions, the effluent is, in effect, the ambient surface water. Thus, it was reasonable to

13 usc the effluent hardness as a measure of a realistic "worst-case" scenario to ensure "that effluent
limitations will be fully protective under all flow conditions."2*
15 in this case, by contrast, there is no evidence that the Sacramento River is, under any existing or

16 reasonably foresceable conditions, an "effluent-dominated stream". Indeed, the evidence clearly indicates

17 otherwise: the normal ratio of river flow to plant discharge is at least 20:l, and the permit specifically

18 provides that the plant must cease discharges when the ratio falls below 14:1, which is expected to be an

19 infrequent event of short duration.* Thus, there is no evidence in this case that the hardness value of the

20 effluent ever is, in effect, the hardness value of the Sacramento River, or represents the "worst-case"
21 downstream hardness of the river. The Court's ruling in the Deer Creek case is factually distinguishable

1 and thus lacks persuasive value in this case.
2 The significant factual difference between the two cases also weighs against giving the Deer Creck
3 decision collateral estoppel effect here. Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, a prior judicial
determination of a legal issue with respect to specific facts may be given effect in subsequent action
S between the same parties. (See, Chern v. Bank of America (1976) 15 Cal. 314 866, 872; Apartment
6 Association of Greater Los Angeles v. City of Los Angeles (2001) 90 Cal. App. 4 1162, 1168-1169.)
7 Even though the intorpretation of the regulatory term "ambiont surface water" represents a legal issue that
8 is common to the two cases, the specific facis of the two cases are not the same.
9 Moreover, there is a well-recognized, if narrow, exception to the collateral estoppel doctrine for
10
significant issues involving the public interest. As stated in Sacramento County Employees' Retirement
11

12 System v. Superior Court (2011) 195 Cal. App. 44 440, 452: "[CJollateral estoppel will not be applied to

13 foreclose the relitigation of an issue of law covering a public agency's ongoing obligation to administer a

14 statute enacted for the public benefit and affecting members of the public not before the court." It is clear

15 that, in establishing effluent limits, respondent Board administers laws enacted for the public benefit and

16 affecting members of the public not before the court. Cases involving potential environmental hazards

17 have been found to be of "tremendous public significance" and thus inappropriate for application of.

18 collateral estoppel. (See, e.g., People v. Union Pacific Railroad (2006) 141 Cal. App. 4th 1228.30) This is

19 such a case. Particularly given the factual differences between the two cases, the Court finds that the

20 public interest weights against precluding petitioner from litigating the issues it raises here.

21 The Court accordingly concludes that petitioner was not precluded from litigating the issue of the
22 proper interpretation and application of the regulatory tenn "ambient surface water" in this case, and that
23 the prior administrative and judicial rulings cited by the opposing parties are not binding or persuasive
24 given the facts of this case.
25 Finally, the Court notes that in adopting an approuch to establishing criteria for hardness-
26
27 30 This case also points our that heightened concerns of potential injustice arise when collateral estoppel is Invoked by a non-party to the prior litigation. As noted above, SRCSD raises collateral estoppel as an issue here, but respondent
28 Board docs not. SRCSD was not a party to the Decr Creck case, which involved the El Dorado Irrigation District.
11
RULING ON SUBMITTED MATTER CASE NO. 34-2013-80001358-CU-WM•GDS

dependent metals that did not strictly follow the requirements of the CTR, respondent Board relied heavily

2 on a 2006 study entitled "California and National Toxics Rule Implementation and Development of

3 Hardness Based Metal Effluent Limitations" 3l The permit explicitly states that this study "..provides a

4 reliable method for calculating protective hardness-dependent CTR criteria, considering all discharge

5 conditions. This methodology produces criteria that ensure these metals do not cause receiving water
toxicity, while avoiding criteria that are unnecessarily stringent."2 The study itself states that its purpose
is to describe a methodology for establishing effluent limitations for hardness-based metals "...that will be
protective under all dilution conditions when the final mixed receiving water/effluent hardness is less than
9 400mg/L, without being overly restrictive.**
10
11 From these statements, it is evident that respondent Board departed from the letter of the

12 regulatory requirements based on a concern that those requirements are stricter than really necessary, and

13 that they are not supported by at least some recent scientific opinion. It may or may not be true that the

14 regulation, as it currently exists, represents the most current scientific thinking. It also may or may not

15 result in unnecessarity strict limitations. This is not, however, a question that the Court needs to resolve.34

16 If the regulation is indeed ouldated, perhaps it needs to be changed. Until it is changed, however,

17 respondent Board is obligated to comply with it. Respondent Board did not do so, and thereby abused its

18 discretion.

19 A writ of mandate therefore shall be issued to direct respondent Board to reconsider the

20 calculation of effuent limits for hardness-dependent metals using the equations set forth in the CTR, but
21 without using the hardness value of the effluent in those equations.

B. Analysis of Additive/ Interactive Toxicity

2 Petitioner's second contention is that respondent Board failed to evaluate the additive or
interactive toxicity of multiple pollutants as required by the applicable Basin Pian. In particular, petitioner

4 argues that there is a reasonable potential for additive or interactive toxicity to certain organisms from the
5 combination of ammonia and copper, both of which are pollutants present in the treated wastewater from
6 the SRCSD plant. Petitioner assets that respondent Board failed to address this possibility in the permit.
7 Petitioner's contention is based on the Fourth Edition of the Water Quality Control Plan (Basin
8 Plan) for the Sacramento River and San Joaquin River Basins.3
9 Under the heading "Water Quality Objectives for Inland Surface Waters" and the subheading 10

11 "Toxicity", the Basin Plan states the following general objective: "All waters shall be maintained free of

12 toxic substances in concentrations that produce detrimental physical responses in human, plant, animal, or

13 aquatic life." This objective applies "regardless of whether the toxicity is caused by a single substance or

14 the interactive effect of multiple substances. 190

15 Under the heading "Policy for Application of Water Quality Objectives", the Basin Plan states:

16 "Where multiple toxio pollutants exist together in water the potential for toxicologic interactions
17 exists. On case by case basis, the Regional Water Board will evaluate available receiving water and
18 effluent data to determine whether there is a reasonable potential for interactive toxicity. Pollutants which
19 are carcinogens or which manifest their toxic effects on the same organ systems or through similar
20 mechanisms will generally be considered to have potentially additive toxicity."
21 The Basin Plan sets forth a formula for analyzing the potential for additive or interactive toxicity:
22 "The concentration of each toxic substance is divided by its toxicologic fimit. The resulting ratios
23 are added for subslances having similar toxicologic effects and, separately, for carcinogens. If such: sum
24 of ratios is less than one an additive toxicity problem is assumed not to exist. If the summation is equal to
25 or greater than one, the combination of chemicals is assumed to present an unacceptable level of

1 toxicologic risk.»38

2 Any analysis of additive or interactive toxicity is governed by the following general policy

3 contained in the Basin Plan:

4 "The Regional Board will also consider all material and relevant information submitted by the

5 discharger and other interested parties and numerical oritería and guidelines for toxic substances developed
6 by [tho State Board and other listed agencies) and other appropriate organizations to evaluate compliance
with this objective."
The three opposition briefs adopt differing (and sometimes inconsistent) approaches to petitioner's
claim regarding additive or interactive toxicity, Respondent Board argues that the appropriate analysis
10 was done for ammonia and copper. SRCSD does not argue that respondent Board did an additive or
11

12 interactive toxicity analysis for ammonia and copper, but argues instead that it was not required to perform

13 such an is analysis in this case, and that there is no mandate to cvaluate "infinite theorctical additive toxicity

14 combinations" * SRCSD further argues that respondent Board appropriately addressed the issue of

15 potential addltive or interactive toxicity by adopting narrative toxicity objectives, requiring whole effluent

16 toxicity testing*', and providing for the "reopening" of the permit if such toxicity were to be found."

17 Intervenor CVCWA argues that petitioner's claim regarding the potential additive or interactive toxicity of

18 ammonia in combination with other pollutants lies outside the scope of its comments at the administrative

19 level and the allegations of its petition in this case. CVCWA also echoes SRCDS's argument that the

20 permit appropriately addressed the potential for additive or interactive toxicity through narrative toxicity

21 objectives, whole effluent toxicity testing, and the "reopener" provision.

22 Based on its review of the permit, the Court concludes that respondent Baard's argument that an
23 additive or interactive toxicity analysis was done for ammonia and copper cannot be sustained. The

1 portion of the permit to which respondent Board cites contains a discussion of whether dilution credits

2 should be allowed for specific pollutants, including ammonia and copper, but there is no discussion of the

3 additive or interactive toxicity of those substances, or of any others.* Indeed, the only discussion of

4 or additive or interactive toxicity that the Court can locate in the permit is in a separate section relating to the
5 pesticides chlorpyrifos and diazinon, which are not at issue in this case.*
6 Nevertheless, the Court does not conclude that respondent Board abused its discretion by not
7 performing additional additive or interactive toxicity analyses for ammonia and copper, or for other
8 substances present in the treated wastewater discharge. The Basin Plan does not require the Board to
9
analyze all potential combinations of pollutants for potential additive or interactive toxicity. Such a task 10
likely would'be extremely difficult, if not virtually impossible, in situations involving multiple pollutants. 11

12 Instead, the Basin Plan directs the Board to focus on pollutants which are carcinogens or which manifest

13 their toxic effects on the same organ systems or through similar mechanisms, As the Basin Plan states,

14 such pollutants are "generally…considered to have potentially additive toxicity."

15 Here, petitioner has not demonstrated thaf ammonia and copper (or any other pollutants present in

16 the treated wastewater discharge) are carcinogens or manifest their toxic effects on the same organ systems

17 or through similar mechanisms. At most, petitioner has shown that there are studies that suggest that some

18 aquatic organisms may be sensitive to combined concentrations of ammonia and copper. The record

19 shows that respondent Board was aware of these studics and considered them, as they are referred to in an

20 attachment to the permit discussing "Ammonia-Related Issues",45 However, these studies (at leasl as

21 described in the cited portions of the record) do not establish that ammonia and copper manifest their toxic
22 effects on aquatic organisms through the same organ systems or through similar mechanisms. Thus, there
23 was no clear signal that the additive or interactive toxicity analysis was required in this case.
24 The Court accordingly concludes that respondent Board did not abusc its discretion by failing to

2 C. Effuent Limitation for Aluminum

3

4 Petitioner's third contention is that respondent Board failed to impose an adequate effluent

5 limitation for aluminum. The permit contains a final annual average effluent limitation for aluminum of

6 200 1g/L, as well as an average monthly effluent limit of 503 ug/L and maximum daily effluent limit of

7 750 ug/L.* Petitioner contends that respondent Board should have imposed an effluent limit for

8 aluminum based on criteria published by USEPA in 1988 and re-published in 1999.

9 In those criteria, USEPA stated: "The procedures described in the 'Guidelines for Deriving

10 Numerical National Water Quality Criteria for the Protection of Aquatic Organisms and their Uses'

11 indicate that, except possibly where a locally important species is very sensitive, freshwater aquatic

12 organisnis and their uses should not be affected unacceptably, when the pH is between 6.5 and 9.0, if the

13 four-day average concentration of aluminum does not exceed 87 Hg/L more than once every three years on

14 the average and if the one-hour average concentration does not exceed 750 pg/L more than one every three

15 years on the averago."A8

16 Petitioner's contention is based on provisions of the applicable Basin Plan which call for

17

18 consideration of USEPA's numerical guidelines where, as here, a narrative water quality objective has

been imposed.

19

20 The Basin Plan applicable to the Sacramento River contains a narrative water quality objective for

21 toxicity that states: "All waters shall be maintained free of toxic substances that produce detrimental

22 physiological responses in human, plant, animal and aquatic lifc.M9 It is undisputed for purposes of this

23 proceeding that aluminum is a toxic substance within the meaning.of this objective.

24 The Basin Plan makes this narrative water quality objective applicable to aquatic life beneficial

25

26 46 In light of this ruling, the Court finds it unnecessary to address CVCWA's contention thai petitioner failed to raise this issue at the administrative level or in its petition.

27 48 See, "Ambient Water Quality Criteria for Aluminum ~ 1988" (RB0174303), and "National Recommended Water

2 uses. 30 However, the Basin Plan also provides that where narrative water quality objectives are applicable

3 to protect a beneficial use, "the Regional Board will, on a case-by-case basis, adopt numerical limitations

4 in orders which will implement the narrative objectives. "* In doing so, the Regional Board "considers,

Ur on a case-by-case basis, direct evidence of beneficial use impacts, all material and relevant information

6 submitted by the discharger and other interested parties, and relevant numerical criteria and guidelines

7 •developed and/or published by other agencies and organizations", including USEPA." "In considering

8 such criteria, the Board evaluates whether the specific numerlcal criteria, which are available through these

10 sources and through other information supplied to the Board, are relevant and appropriate to the situation

11 at hand and, therefore, should be used in determining compliance with the narrative objective."33

12 It is undisputed that the State Board repeatedly has held that National Recommended Ambient

aU Water Quality Criteria published by USEPA are appropriate information to be considered by Regional
Boards in issuing waste discharge permits." The issue in this case is whether respondent Board was
required to use the USEPA numbers for aluminum in the SRCSD permit.
The permit recognized USEPA's recommended criteria, but found that they should not be applied

17 in the specific case of SRCSD's discharges into the Sacramento River. The permit expressed the rationale
for this conolusion as follows:

18

19 "[I]nformation contained in the footnotes to the [USEPA's published criteria] indicate that the

20 development of the chronic criterion was based on specific receiving water conditions where there is low

21 pH (below 6.5) and low hardness levels (below 50mg/L as CaCOs). The

measured Sacramento River (SR) has been

22 to have hardness values - typically between 26 and 100 mg/L as CaCOz. The SR has been

23 measured above the discharge to have a pH between 6.4 to 8.8. Thus, it is unlikely that application of the

24 chronic criterion of 87 Hg/L is necessary to protect aquatic life in the Sacramento River in the vicinity of

the discharge. For similar reasons, the Ulah Department of Environmental Quality (Department) only
applies the 87 g/L chronic criterion for aluminum where the pH is less than 7.0 and the hardness is less
3 than 50 mg/L as CaCO, [in] the receiving water after mixing. For conditions where the pH equals or
exceeds 7.0 and the hardness is equal to or excceds 50 mg/L as CaCO3, the Dcpartment regulates
5 aluminum based on the 750 sg/L acute criterion. In this site-specific case it is likely that application of
6 the stringent chronic criteria (87 pg/L) is overly protective.n5S
The footnote referred to in the permit is found in USEPA's 1999 republication of the
8 recommendod water quality criteria (also referred to in its title as a "correction"). As mentioned above,
the aluminum criteria in the 1999 republication were unchanged from those stated in the 1988 publication,
10

I1 However, footnote L. to the aluminum criteria appeared to cast some doubt on those criteria.

12 At the outset, the footnote states: "There are three major reasons why the use of Water-Effect

13 Ratios might be appropriate."8 A Water-Effect Ratio is ".an appropriate measure of the toxicity of a

14 material obtained in water from a site water divided by the same measure of the toxicity of the same

15 material obtained simultaneously in a laboratory dilution water."7 This statement suggests that the

16 aluminum criteria are not necessarily appropriate for all site-specific water conditions.

17 Two of the reasons stated in the footnote to support this statement are potentially relevant here.

18 The first is that "[t)he value of 87 pg/L is based on a toxicity test with the striped bass in water

19 with pil m 6,5.6.6 and hardness < 10 mg/L." However, as the footnote goes on to point out, data from a

20 1994 study involving aluminum water-effect ratio for discharges from a plant in West Virginia "indicate

21 that aluminum is substantially less toxic at higher pH and hardness, but the effects of pH and hardness are
22 not well quantified at this time."58
23 The second is that "EPA is aware of field data indicating that many high quality waters in the U.S.

1 contain more than 87 pg/L, when either total recoverable or dissolvable or is measured.»39

2 Petitioner argues that the rationale stated in the permit for deviating from the USEPA

3 recommended criteria should be rejected because the weight of the evidence regarding site-specific

4 conditions in the Sacramento River does not justify that deviation. In essence, petitioner argues that the
site-specific conditions in this case closely match those of the studies that were used to develop the
USEPA aluminum criteria. Petitioner points to a table in the 1988 published criteria showing that the
criteria were based on studies using water with a range of hardness values, including values well above 50
mg/L as CaCO,.0 Petitioner then cites to evidence in the record regarding the river's hardness valuss,
with a lowest recorded value of 26 mg/L as CaCO, and the majority of 100 measurements at a level of less
10

11 than 60 mg/L as CaCO,, 6l Similarly, petitioner points out that the USEPA criteria specifically

12 recommend the 87 ug/L chronic criterion where the pH of receiving water is in the range of 6.5-9.0.°2

13 Petitioner then cites evidence that the pH values of the Sacramento River have been recorded in a range

14 from 6.4 to 8.8.00

15 The Court concludes that respondent Board did not abuse its discretion when it determined not to

16 adopt the USEPA-recommended aluminum criteria. The permit demonstrates that respondent Board

17 considered those criteria, which it was required to do. The permit also demonstrates that respondent Board

18 appropriately considered the information contained in the 1999 USEPA footnole to the aluminum criteria

19 as well as site-specific conditions in adopting different numerical criteria.

20 In particular, respondent Board considered the fact that that the hardness values and the pH values

21 of the Sacramento River typically had been measured at significantly higher levels than those used to

22 establish the USEPA-recommended 87 ug/L value. This was reasonable in light of the statement in the
23 USEPA footnote describing study data indicating that aluminum is substantially less toxic at higher pH

2 and hardness. It was also reasonable in in light of the information in the 1988 publication showing that tests

3 involving the effect of aluminum on young brook trout and striped bass were conducted in water at a pH of
6.5 to 6.6, which is lower than the typical readings for the Sacramento River.4 Such information

U supported respondent Board's conclusion that the site-specific conditions of the Sacramento River justified
a departure from the published criteria.
6 USEPA's statement that "the effects of pH and hardness are not well quantified at this time" does

8 not preclude respondent Board from departing from the published criteria. This statement must be viewed
as a careful acknowledgement of scientific uncertainty, rather than as : a restriction on the agency's

10 discretion to adjust the criteria to local conditions. Indeed, in a 2010 comment letter to the Central to Valley

11 Regional Water Quality Control Board regarding water quality criteria for aluminum in connection with

12 the Placer County Sewer Maintenance District's NPDES permit*S, USEPA stated that although it had not

13 changed its recommended aluminum criteria, "the appropriate aluminum criteria values for higher

14 hardness situations remain uncertain", and that "it may be reasonable to apply a higher criterion value if

15 the ambient hardness levels are substantially and consistently higher than the values used in deriving the

16 existing chronic criterion valuc." Thus, even though USEPA ultimately recommended "the conservative

17

18 approach of retaining the existing effluent Ilmitations in the new permit" in that case, it also recognized
that Regional Boards could depart from the published criteria based on site-specific conditions.6o

19

20 Respondent Board also considered information showing that the maximum observed "upstream

21 recciving water concentration" of aluminum was 8800 pg/L. As stated above, the 1999 USEPA footnote

22 recognized that many high-quality waters in the U.S. contain levels of aluminum in excess of 87 Hg/L.

1 invariably show adverse effects even at very high concentrations.68

2 At the same time, respondent Board also had evidence that actual discharges from the SRCSD
plant made a relatively small contribution to aluminum levels in the river. Specifically, 61 samples
collected by SRCSD between June 2005 and October 2009 recorded aluminum levels of 12 to 35.2 pg/L.00
Oiven this data, it is not clear that adopting the USEPA criteria really would have been more protective,
6 because actual discharge levels were lower than the criteria in any event.
The Court thereföre concludes that petitioner has not demonstrated that respondent Board was
8 precluded from departing from the USEPA published critería for aluminum, or that the weight of the

10 evidence establishes that respondent Board abused its discretion in doing sO.

D. Weekly EMuent Limitations for Aluminum
11

12 Peritioner's fourth contention is that respondent Board failed to establish average weekly effluent

13 limitations for aluminum as required by applicable regulatory law.

14 Title 40, Section 122.45(d)(2) of the Code of Federal Regulations requires that "[f)or continuous

15 discharges all permit effuent limitations, standards, and prohibitions, including those necessary to achieve

16 water quality standards, shail unless impracticable be stated as: [...] (2) A verage weekly and average

17 monthly discharge linitations for (publicly owned treatment works]."

18 In this case, the permit established an average monthly effluent limitation for aluminum
19 (503 pg/L), but not an average weekly limitation.7 In a section entitled "Averaging Period for Effluent
20 Limitations". the permit acknowledged that Section 122.45(d) requires average weekly discharge
21 limitations unless impracticable, bul stated that "[t]his Order utilizes maximum daily effluent limitations in
22 tieu of average weekly effluent limitations" for a pumber of pollutants, including aluminum." The
23 rationale for doing so was stated as follows: "For effluent limitations based on Secondary MCLs, this
24 Order includes annual average effluent limitations. The Secondary MCLs are drinking water standards

contained in Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations. Title 22 requires compliance with these
standards on an annual average basis, when sampling at least quarterly. Since it is necessary to determine
compliance on an annual average basis, it is impracticable to calculate average weekly and average
monthly effluent limitations. »7
Respondent Board relies on USEPA's "Technical Support Document for Water Quality-based
Toxics Control" in support of its contention that a weckly effluent limitation for aluminum is
impracticable in this case. Section 5.2.3 of the Technical Support Document, entitled "Expression of
Permit Limits", begins by acknowledging the requirements of Section 122.45(d). However, it also states:
"[i]n fieu of an [average weekly limit] for POTWs, EPA recommends establishing [a maximum daily
10
limit] (or a maximum test result for chronic toxicity) for toxic pollutants and poltutant parameters in water
11

12 quality permitting. This is appropriate for at least two reasons. First, the basis for the 7-day average for

13 POTWs derives from the secondary treatment requirements. This basis is not related to the need for
14 assuring achievement of water quality standards. Second, a 7-day average, which could comprise up to

15 seven or more daily samples, could average out peak toxic concentrations and therefore the discharge's

16 potential for causing acute toxic effects would be missed. A [maximum daily limit], which is measured by

17 grab sample, would be toxicologically protective of potential acute toxicity impacts. The Technical

18 Support Document includes a section describing procedures for deriving monthly and daily limits, but not

19 for deriving an average weekly limit."

20 In this instance, the Court concludes that respondent Board abused its discretion by not

21 establishing averagc weekly discharge limitations for aluminum. The applicable federal regulation

22 explicitly requires the establishment of weekly limitations unless it is "impracticable" to do so. Nothing
23 that has been cited to the Court from the record indicates that it is "impracticable" to establish a weekly
24 limitation for aluminum.

question at oral argument essentially concede that such a limitation may be calculated without undue
difficulty. ln its original opposition brief, CVCWA even went so far as to admit that there has been "a

technical violation of the regulations", while arguing that a weekly limitation is not necessary to mect
applicable water quality standards or offer greater protection of beneficial uses than a monthly limitation."
This was also the rationale offered in EPA's Technical Support Document, and echoed by respondent
Board and SRCSD in their opposition briefs. As a rationale for not complying with applicable law, it is
not persuasive. To the extent that the applicable law actually does not represent reasonable approach 10

10 establishing effluent limitations, the law may need to be changed. Until it is changed, however, that law

11 unequivocally requires the establishment of a weekly limitation. Respondent Board WaS obligated to do

12 what the law required, not what it, SRCSD or even EPA deemed to be a reasonable substitute.

17 6o Petitioner's fifth contention is that respondent Bourd improperly granted SRCSD an exemption
from applicable rules regarding the allowable tom perature differential between discharged treated
wastewater and the receiving river water.

20

21 The applicable rules are set forth in the State Board's Water Quality Control Plan for Control of

22 Temperature in the Coastal and Interstate Waters and Enclosed Bays and Estuaries of California

23 (commonty known as the "Thermal Plan"). As relevant to this case, absent the granting of an exception,

24 the Thermal Plan requires that the maximum effluent temperature shalt not exceed the natural receiving

25 water temperature by more than 20° F, and that elevated temperature waste discharges either individually

26 or combined with other discharges shall nol create a zone, defined by water temperatures of more than [°

27 F above natural recciving water temperature, which exceeds 2S percent of the cross-sectional area of a

1 main river channel at any point.16

2 The Thermal Plan permits the Regional Board, with the concurrence of the State Baard, to grant
an exception to the temperature requirements. The granting of such an exception is subject to applicable
federal statutory and regulatory requirements."
One such federal regulation, Title 40 C.F.R. § 125,73(a), provides that thermal discharge effluent
limitations or standards established in permits may be less stringent than those required by applicable
standards and limitations if the discharger can demonstrate "that the alternative effluent limitation desired
8 by the discharger, considering the cumulative impact of its thermal discharge together with all other

10 significant impacts on the species affected, ... will assure the protection and propagation of a balanced

11 indigenous community of shellfish, fish and wildlife in and on the body of water into which the discharge

12 is to be made.»78 Subdivision (c) of the same regulation provides that an existing discharger may use the

13 absence of prior appreciable harm of the effluent to demonstrate that the alternative effluent temperature

14 will assure the protection and propagation of a balanced indigenous community.

15 In this case, SRCSD previously had been granted certain exceptions from the Thennal Plan when

16 its prior permit was issued in 2000. The current permit continued those exceptions." The exceptions

17 provide that the maximum temperature of the discharge shall not exceed the natural receiving water

18 temperature by more than 25° F (rather than 20° F) from October 1 through April 30, and that if the natural

19 receiving water temperature is less than 65° F, the discharge shall not create : zone, defined by water

20 temperature of morc than 2° F (rather than 1° F) above the natural receiving water temperature, which

21 cxceeds 25 percent of the cross-sectional area of the river at any point outside the zone of initial dilution.$0
22 The permit itself, however, expresses clear uncertainty about the actual effect of the temperature
23 exceptions. In the section setting forth "Reopener Provisions", the permit requires a temperature study,

2 "There are uncertainties that the discharge may impact aquatic life in the vicinity of the discharge

3 as regulated under the existing thermal exemption conditions. This Order requires the Discharger to

4 complete a study of temperature's potential effect in the receiving water. This reopener provision allows
5 the Central Valley Water Board to reopen this Order for modification of effluent limitations and receiving
6 water limitations and requirements for temperature if afler review of the study results it is determined that
7 the discharge impacts beneficial uses.*

9
impression of uncertainty:

"The Discharger shall submit workplan and time schedule for Executive Officer approval for 11

12 determining whethor pormitted conditions are protective of aquatic life beneficial uses in the Sacramento

13 River. [.] The work plan shall be implemented upon approval by the Executive Officer. The study will

14 include an evaluation of: (I) the existing Thermal Plan Exception and its effects on aquatic life, and (2)
any proposed request for new Thermal Plan Exception(s). The discharger must consult with the U.S. Fish
- - 15

16 and Wildtife Service, the National Marine Fisherics Service, and the California Department of Fish and

17 Game, to consider additional issues (such as fish attractively [sic] to mixing zone areas) in development of

18 the workplan for the Study.»62

19 In reatity, the permit does not contain any finding to the effect "...that the alternative effluent

20 limitation desired by the discharger, considering the cumulative impact of its thermal discharge together
21 with all other significant impacts on the species affected, . .will assure the protection and propagation of a
22 balanced indigenous community of shellfish, fish and wildlife in and on the body of water into which the
23 discharge is to be made."6
24 Instead, the permit may be read as concluding, at lcast implicitly, that no such finding could be
25 made on the basis of the information then available to the Regional Board. The permit noted that SRCSD

previously had submitted a study in 2005 assessing the thermal impacts of its discharge, which

2 recommended continuation of the thermal plan exceptions originally granted in 2000. The permit further

3 noted that the 2005 study had been reviewed by the National Marine Fisheries Service, which did not

4 indicate any concerns with the proposed thermal plan exceptions. However, the permit also stated; "Since

5 this time, however, conditions under which the evaluation was made have changed. There has been a
6 significant pelagic organism decline in the Delta, new species are threatened and there has been a change
in the diffuser configuration." 54 Thus, the permit concluded that the 2005 study could not support the
8 finding required for a thermal plan exception.
9 The permit stated that SRCSD had submitted a revised study in July 2010. It summarized the
10

11 content of that study and also described certain concerns raised by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as

12 well as that agency's recommendation for further studies and monitoring "...to determine whether

13 permitted conditions are protective of delta smelt and Sacramento River biota."45

14 Having acknowledged the 2010 study and the recommendation for further studies and monitoring,

15 respondent Board simply continued the existing thermal plan exceptions. It made no additional finding

16 that the 2010 study addressed the concems expressed regarding changed conditions, significant pelagic

17 organism decline in the Delta, and new species being threatened, but did, as described above, require

18 further temperature studies.

19 The Court concludes that respondent Board abused its discretion by continuing the Thermal Plan

20 exceptions in effect without first concluding that the pormitted thermal discharge, considered cumulatively

21 with all other significant impacts on affected species, would "assure the protection and propagation of a

22 balanced indigenous community of shellfish, fish and wildlife in and on" the Sacramento River. The
23 applicable regulation required that such a finding be mado before granting exceptions to the Thermal Plan.
24 The approach of the permit was to admit uncertainty regarding the actual effects of the thermal discharge,
25 continue the exceptions anyway, and then require studies to determine whether there was any adverse

I effect on aquatic life. This approach effectively stands the regulation on its hcad.

2 SRCSD contends that the weight of the evidence supports the granting of the exceptions, relying

3 largely on the content of the 2010 revised study. This contention is not persuasive. Respondent Board
4 clearly did not make a finding that the study provided the assurance required by the regulation. Moreover,
5 the Court observes that the study focuses solely on the effects of the thermal discharge and does not
6 analyze the cumulative impact of the thermal discharge together with all other significant impacts. The
7 study therefore did not fulfill the regulatory requirements.
8 SRCSD also argues that respondent Board could rely on the absence of prior appreciable harm, as
provided in subsection (c) of the regulation. That provision is not applicable here, because respondent 10
Board did not make any finding of absence of prior appreciable harm from the plant's thermal discharges. 11

12 To the contrary, as quoted above, the permit specifically noted that there had been a significant pelagic

13 organism decline in the Delta and that new species were threatened since the 2005 study. Evidence of lack
14 of prior appreciable harm is not proper basis to support the Thermal Plan exceptions in this case,

15 Citing to expert testimony in the record, SRCSD also argues that the Thermal Plan requirements
16 are not based on the most current scientific understanding of thermal effects.% This argument is off the

17 point, Respondent Board was not precluded, as matter of law, from granting exceptions to those
18 requirements if it could make the appropriate finding based on evidence in the record. Respondent Board
3 did not make the required finding here, and indeed indicated that it could not do SO based on the evidence
20 it had before it. Whether the normal requirements are scientifically valid is essentially irrelevant to this
21 case.

22 Finally, SRCSD argues that petitioner failed to exhaust administrative remedies by specifically
23 challenging the language in the "Reopener Provisions" of the permit. This argument is not persuasive. in
24 its comments in both the Regional Board and Staie Board procecdings in this case, petitioner specifically
25 raised the issue of whether thermal discharges from the treatment plant under the Thermal Pian exceptions

1 that had been in effect since 2000 had an adverse impact on aqualic life in the Sacramento River.87 Those

2 comments were more than adequate to preserve the issue petitioner raises here.

3 A writ of mandate therefore will be issued to requiro respondent Board to vacate the Thermal Plan

4 exceptions in the permit, and to direct respondent Board to reconsider the issue of whether such exceptions

5 may be granted under Title 40 C.F.R. § 125.73(a).

6 F. Mass-Based Effluent Limits

Petitioner's sixth, and final, contention is that respondent Board abused its discretion when it
failed to adopt mass-based effluent limitations for many of the constituents of the effluent. Instead, as
described above for aluminum, the permit expresses effluent limitations in terms of concentration
10
(mg/L).$8
11

12 The Court finds that respondent did not abuse its discretion. The governing federal regulation, 40

13 C.F.R. § 122.45(((1), provides, in relevant part: "All pollutants listed in permits shall have limitations,

14 standards or prohibitions expressed in terms of mass except: (..] (ti) When applicable standards and

15 limitations are expressed in terins of other units of measurement,"

16 In this case, the permit exprossed effluent limitations in terms of other units of measurement,

17 specifically, concentration (mg/L). The permit explicitly cited the regulation as authority for doing so,39

[8 The permit complied with the letter of the regulation.

19 Petitioner cites to a 1991 USEPA dacument entitled "Technical Support Document for Water
20 Quatity-based Toxics Control" as authority for the proposition that effluent limitations must be expressed

21 in terms of mass. The document states that mass limitations in terms of pounds or kilograms per day "can

22 be calculated for all chemical-specific toxins such as chiorine or chromium", and that "EPA recommends
23 that permit limits on both mass and concentration be specified for effluents discharging into waters with

26 See, perisioner's comments to the Regional Board dated October 8, 2010 (RB0036613-36614) and its subsequent petition for review to the State Board (SB0115-01119).

1 less than 100 fold dilution to ensure attainment of water quality standards "90 The document thus

2 expresses a recommendation rather than a legal requirement, and does not override the language of the

3 applicable regulation itself.

4 Finally, the Court notes that the permit regulates the SRCSD plant based on a maximum allowable
5 flow of 181 million gallons per day." Because there is an upper limit on discharge, the concentration
6 limits specifled in the permit effectively set mass-based limits as well.
The Court accordingly concludes that respondent Board acted in accordance with applicable
8 regulatory law and did not abuse its discretion by failing to establish mass-based effluent limits for all

constituents of the effluent.
10
V. Conclusion
11

12 For the reasons stated above, the petition for writ of mandate is granted in part and denied in part.

13 The petition is granted with regard to petitioner's claim arising out of the calculation of effluent

[4 limitations for hardness-dependent metals. A writ shall be issued directing respondent Board to vacate the

15 portions of the permit cstablishing effluent limitations for hardness-dependent metals, and to recalculate

16 such effluent limitations using the equations set forth in the California Toxics Rule (Title 40, CFR, §

17 131.38), and without using the hardness value of the effluent in those equations.

18 The petition is granted with regard to petitioner's claim arising out of the establishment of periodic
19 effluent limitations for aluminum. A writ shall be issued directing respondent Board to establish a weekly

20 effluent limitation for aluminum as required by Title 40, CFR, § 122.45(d)(2).

21 The petition is granted with regard to petitioner's claim arising out of the granting of Thermal Plan
22 exceptions. A writ shall be issued directing respondent Board to vacate the Thermai Plan exceptions in the
23 permit and to reconsider the issue of whether Thermal Plan exceptions may be granted in this case under
24 the standards set forth in Title 40, CFR, § 125.73(a).
25 The writ shall not otherwise control or limit respondent Bourd's discretion. The writ shall provide

1 that respondent Board shall make a rcturn within 60 days, setting forth what it has done to comply with the

2 writ. The Court shall retain jurisdiction over this matter to enforce compliance with the writ as necessary.

3 The petition is denied with regard to peritioner's claims involving lack of additive and interactive

4 toxicity analysis, the establishment of effluent limitations for aluminum (except as to the average weekly
5 limit), and lack of mass-based effluent limitations.
6 In accordance with Local Rules 2.07 and 2.15, counsel for petitioner is directed to prepare a
formal order granting the petition for writ of mandate in part and denying it in part, as stated above,
incorporating this ruling as an exhibit, and a separate judgment and writ of mandate; submit the order,
judgment and writ to all other counsel for approval as to form in accordance with Rule of Court 3.1312(a); 10
lo and thereafter submit them to the Court for signature, entry of judgment and issuance of the writ in

12 accordance with Rule of Court 3.1312(b).
