A

P INTRODUCTION

2 1. Over extensive public opposition and in violation of the California Environmental

3 Quality Act (*CEQA") and the Long Beach Municipal Code, on April 13, 2021, the City of

4 Long Beach approved the Pacific Place Project (*Project") based on a mitigated negative

5 declaration ("MND") instead of an environmental impact report ("EIR"), even though a fair

6 argument exists that the Project will have significant adverse environmental impacts.

7 2. The Project would replace over 19 acres of open space along the Los Angeles

8 River with a large-scale commercial warehouse, storage, office, and parking lot development

0 that would have adverse impacts on the environment with regard to air quality, aesthetics,

10 biological resources, geology/soils, hazards/hazardous materials, historic and cultural resources,

11 tribal resources, and hydrology and water quality, among other impacts. The Project will also

12 significantly reduce any possible relief and recreational opportunities in the area, whereas

13 currently the surrounding community would be able to use portions of this space and nearby

14 areas for passive and active recreation.

15 3. The City's MND lacks substantial evidence to support many of its conclusions that
16 the Project's potential adverse impacts on the environment will not be significant.

17 4. Since a fair argument exists that the Project will have significant adverse impacts

18 on historic resources, aesthetics, biological resources, hydrology and water quality, and

19 recreation, and since the MND fails entirely to acknowledge, analyze, or fully mitigate these
potential impacts to a level below significance, the City's approval violates the California 20

21 Environmental Quality Act, and the Project approvals must be rescinded.

22 JURISDICTION

23 5. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1094.5 of the Code

24 of Civil Procedure.

25 6. This Court also has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1085 of the

26 Code of Civil Procedure, and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

STATEMENT OF FACTS

2 Project Area

3 14. The Project Site is in the City of Long Beach in Los Angeles County. It is

4 separated into two areas: (1) the Artesia Acquisition Company, LLC parcels (*Artesia Parcels")

5 and (2) the MacDonald Trust parcels (*MacDonald Parcels").

6 15. As proposed, the Project on the Artesia Parcels (Artesia Project) will transform a

7 formerly recreational use (i.e., golf driving range) into a three-story, 152,745 square foot self-

8 storage unit, recreational vehicle (RV) storage area for 578 vehicles, and a self-serve car wash

Q with a waste disposal station. Specifically, the Artesia Project would develop an asphalt

10 parking lot to accommodate over 500 vehicles, including trailers, campers, boats, and trucks.

11 The Project's three-story structure would be permitted to build additional office space and

12 would have a maximum height of 43feet 11 inches, exceeding the current maximum building

13 height of 28 feet under proposed Commercial Storage (CS) zoning. (MND, p. 3-1.)

14 16. The Project on the MacDonald Parcels would include a 77,000 square foot single-

15 story warehouse and a 10-truck loading dock. This development would be permitted for and

16 assumed to consist of warehouse space and office space that would be built on the MacDonald

17 Parcels north of the Artesia Parcels. (Notice of Intent (NOI), p. 2.)

18 17. Combined, the Project area totals approximately 19.41 acres. (NOI, p. 1-2.)

19 18. Heightening the potential for adverse environmental impacts, there are 13

20 abandoned oil wells in the Project area, surrounded by land that formerly stored toxic waste and

21 sewage that is now buried. (NOI p. 2.)

22 19. The Project requires numerous entitlements including a general plan amendment,
23 conditional use permit, site plan review, specific plan amendments, zone change, and a height

24 standards variance.

25 20. The height standards variance that the Applicant requests is only necessary

26 because the Applicant requests a zone change from the original zone designation of Light

27 Industrial (IL), which allows structures up to 60 feet (Long Beach Municipal Code § 21.33.130,

28 Table 33-3), to Commercial Storage (CS), which allows structures up to only 28 feet.

P Project Site History: Oil Production and Golf Facility.

2 21. The Artesia Parcels were formerly used as an oil brine water treatment facility
3 beginning in 1926 for nearby and onsite oil production activities. Oil brine was pumped to
4 evaporation and treatment ponds (i.e., oil sumps) located on the Artesia Parcels and the

5 majority of the Artesia Parcels were a used as a treatment sump. Water was allowed to evaporate

6 from the brine or seep into the subsurface below the sumps leaving behind a sludge. Following
7 evaporation, the remaining sludge was left in the sumps or transported to an offsite location.

8 Evaporation operations reportedly ceased at the Project site in the mid-1950s. Fill soil was

9 imported to the site in the 1970's; the fill was not suitable for unrestricted use (DTSC 2020).

10 22. Between 1937 and 1981, 13 oil wells were drilled onsite; 11 of these oil wells

11 produced oil. All 13 wells were abandoned between 1961 and 2014.

12 23. A golf learning facility opened on the Project Site between 1995 and 1998
13 consisting of driving range; putting practice and chipping areas; a snack bar; a a golf shop; a
14 maintenance building; and a paved parking lot. The learning facility was listed in the City
15 Directory as late as 2014.

16 Project Surroundings.

17 24. The Project Site is located on the east bank of the Los Angeles River. The Project
18 Site is also adjacent to a historic equestrian trail. It is also located within the boundaries of a

19 historic Tongvan village site.

20 25. The Project's census tract in western Long Beach ranks worse than 85 percent of
21 the rest of the state for pollution burden, attributable to contaminated sites, solid waste and
22 hazardous vehicle emissions in the area. (See https://oehha.ca.gov/calenviroscreen (last visited
23 Nov. 14, 2020.) The Project area is also a designated "Disadvantaged Community" per
24 California Senate Bill (SB) 535. The area is a predominantly Hispanic and Asian community
25 that is 82% people of color. The area has more people living with asthma, emergency
26 department visits for asthma symptoms, and deaths from asthma, than 91% of census tracts
27 throughout California. The proposed Project not only exacerbates these critical health impacts,
28 but brings in land use that in no way serves this underserved community.

Printed on Recycled Paper 5 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

26. Directly across from the Project Site, on the other side of the Metro A Line and

2 Del Mar Ave, are Los Cerritos Elementary School and a public park, Los Cerritos Park.

3 27. Single-family residential homes are also adjacent to the Project Site. Petitioner

4 Riverpark Coalition includes landowners and residents who reside in these adjacent homes.

5 28. In 1930, cogstones were found at the Rancho Los Cerritos, which makes this
6 location a Sacred Site. The site is one of the last remaining open spaces that can be utilized for
7 continuation of Tongvan cultural practices by Tongvan people.

8 Project Review and Approval
9 29. In October of 2020, the City of Long Beach issued an Initial Study and Mitigated

10 Negative Declaration for the Pacific Place Project. The City anticipated industrial uses

11 including a single-story building consisting of 73,500 square-feet warehouse space and 3,500

12 square-feet of office space, car wash, and RV parking facility. The Initial Study also evaluated

13 potential environmental effects associated with the Project's construction and operation.

14 30. Findings determined that the Project has the potential to have significant impacts

15 on the following topics unless the recommended mitigation measures described were
16 incorporated into the Project: air quality, biological resources, cultural resources, geology and

17 soils, hazards and hazardous materials, and tribal cultural resources.

18 31. Prior to any project approval, and during the public review process for the MND,

19 the Project Applicant performed a "surcharge test" to measure the bearing capacity of the area

20 beneath the building footprint. This involved grading and moving soil from the northern end of

21 the Site to the southern end, creating a mound of soil approximately 15 feet high to simulate

22 future building weight, and field monitoring to evaluate settlement behavior of the Site for

23 several months. While the DTSC work notice stated that this mound of soil would be covered,

24 it was not.

25 32. In November of 2020, the Riverpark Coalition and other community members
26 submitted extensive and detailed comments opposing the Project as proposed and comments

27 regarding the need for an EIR to properly analyze the potential significant environmental

28 impacts of the Project. Petitioner was concerned with the harmful impact of allowing industrial

Printed on Recycled Paper 6 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

P development on a site designated as a "Disadvantaged Community" per California State Bill
2 (SB) 535. Petitioner also commented that the Project area has more people living with asthma,

3 emergency department visits for asthma symptoms, and deaths from asthma, than 91% of

4 census tracts throughout California.

5 33. Petitioner's comments also noted environmental impacts that the City's MND did

6 not sufficiently address including air quality, available park space, construction noise impacts,

7 drainage and flood issues, traffic, exposure to toxic and hazardous substances, biological

8 resources, tribal, cultural and historic resources, aesthetics and scenic vistas, hydrology and

9 water quality, mobility and transportation, social equity and land use and planning, recreation
10 and open space, public services, utilities, geology and soils. Petitioner also contended that the
11 developer's premature surcharge tests violated CEQA.
12 34. On or about December 17, 2020, the City's Planning Commission held a public
13 hearing and approved the Project MND. Petitioner appealed their decision due to numerous
14 flaws in the environmental review process.

15 35. The City agendized Petitioner's appeal for the April 12, 2021 City Council
16 Meeting. Petitioner submitted extensive comments regarding the significant public health and
17 environmental impacts of the Project as proposed.

18 36. On or about April 13, 2021, the City posted a Notice of Determination for the
19 Project.

20 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

21 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

22 37. Petitioners objected to the Project in the administrative process, and fully
23 exhausted their administrative remedies. Petitioners submitted letters during the comment
24 period raising the issues set forth herein.

25 38. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
26 unless this Court grants the requested writs of mandate and injunctive relief. In the absence of
27 such remedies, Respondent's approval of the project would form the basis for a development
28 project that would proceed in violation of state law.

O FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (VIOLATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

11 42. Petitioners incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

12 The Fair Argument Standard Requires Preparation of an EIR

13 43. CEQA prohibits a lead agency from approving a project that may have:

14 significant impact on the environment without first preparing, considering, and certifying an

15 EIR. The City violated CEQA by adopting an MND for the Project, despite substantial

16 evidence supporting a fair argument that the project may have a significant impact on the

17 environment.

18 44. The purpose of the initial study is to provide the lead agency with adequate

19 information regarding project to determine the appropriate environmental review document

20 and "documentation of the factual basis for the finding in a negative declaration that a project

21 will not have a significant effect on the environment." (Ctr. for Sierra Nevada Conservation v.

22 County of El Dorado (2012) 202 Cal. App. 4th 1156, 1170, citations omitted.) There must be

23 basis within the record to support the conclusions reached by the initial study. (Lighthouse

24 Field Beach Rescue v. City of Santa Cruz (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1170, 1201.) "Where an

25 agency. . . fails to gather information and undertake an adequate environmental analysis in its

26 initial study, a negative declaration is inappropriate." (El Dorado County Taxpayers for

27 Quality Growth v. County of El Dorado (2004) 122 Cal. App. 4th 1591, 1597, citations

28 omitted.)

Printed on Recycled Paper 8 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

45. There is substantial evidence in the record to support a fair argument that the

2 project may have significant adverse effects on the environment, including, but not limited to,

3 the following impacts:

4 a. Land Use Planning and Recreation Impacts Would be Significant.

5 46. Under CEQA, lead agencies must analyze whether a proposed project is
6| inconsistent with applicable land use policies, such as the governing general plan. (Cal. Code

7 Regs, tit. 14 ("CEQA Guidelines") § 15125, subd. (d).) If substantial evidence supports a fair

8 argument that the proposed project conflicts with the General Plan, then an EIR is required.

9 (Pocket Protectors v. City of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 903, 930.)
10 47. The City of Long Beach General Plan Land Use Element requires implementation
11 of the Long Beach Riverlink Plan. Implementation Strategy LU-M-86 requires the City to:
12 "Update and implement the Long Beach Riverlink Plan to create a continuous greenway of
13 pedestrian and bike paths and linkages along the east bank of the Los Angeles River, as well as
14 to connect to existing and future parks, open space and beaches along western portions of the
15 City."

16 48. Due to historical development trends that favored industry with high levels of

17 pollution, western Long Beach has a severe lack of parks and open space. In 2002, the City's
18 Open Space and Recreation Element formally established a goal to reverse this harmful trend

19 and achieve an average of eight (8.0) acres of recreational open space per 1,000 residents.
20 Subsequently, in 2007, the Long Beach Department of Parks, Recreation and Marine authored
21 the RiverLink planning document (RiverLink). The RiverLink provides a vision of an a

22 integrated open space system and a framework to connect westside neighborhoods and greater
23 Long Beach with the Los Angeles River (LA River.) When fully implemented the RiverLink
24 was supposed to contain 263 acres of open space. Long Beach's vision for the LA River is one
25 of a "River that provides aesthetic, recreational, and ecological benefits, in addition to serving
26 its flood control purposes." (See LA RiverLink planning document,
27 http://www.longbeach.gov/globalassets/park/media-library/documents/business-

28 operations/about/in-development/riverlink-report/(last visited Nov. 15, 2020.)

Printed on Recycled Paper 9 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

49. The RiverLink plan specifically stated for the "Wrigley Height-North" portion
2 "Riverlink proposes keeping the driving range and improving the excess River right -of-way as

3 riparian woodland to complement the adjacent wetland at Dominguez Gap (see Exhibit 18)."

4 On the "Wrigley Heights-South" portion, Riverlink "proposes that as much of the area as

5 possible become an open space destination containing a restored wetland, riparian woodland,

6 pedestrian and bicycle paths, and a neighborhood park with a playground, picnic areas, and

7 other amenities (see Exhibit 21)."

8 50. With the current proposed project and others similar to it that put planned

0 greenspace to other uses (such as the Riverwalk project in 2015), the open space vision in the

10 RiverLink document would never be achieved.

11 51. Paving over this land to build a parking lot and storage center would permanently

12 deepen east and western Long Beach's parkland disparity. Additionally, coverage with

13 pavement can contribute to the heat island effect that disproportionately impacts disadvantaged

14 communities with increased local temperatures. These impacts are significant and require

15 preparation of an EIR.

16 52. The Project would foreclose public access and green space on the Project site.

17 Thus, an EIR must be prepared to analyze this significant impact.

18 53. There is an enormous disparity of park and open space access in the City of Long

19 Beach. According to the Long Beach Department of Parks, Recreation of Marine's ("DPRM")

20 2003 Strategic Plan, the West park district has only acre of parkland per 1,000 residents,

21 while the East park district has 16.7 acres per 1,000 residents. To respond to this disparity,

22 DPRM included Strategy 1.1 as part of its Strategic Plan, which established a target of 8 acres
23 per 1.000 residents. Strategy 1.1 identified 50 acres in Wrigley Heights for park development.

24 The City failed to maintain its commitment to provide much needed park space in western Long

25 Beach through reserving the Project site for park access.

26 54. These are significant recreational impacts that the MND fails to mitigate.

27 55. The MND does not evaluate the Project's compatibility with the City's LA River

28 Master Plan, and fails to identify significant inconsistencies with the RiverLink planning
