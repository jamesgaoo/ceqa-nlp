I. INTRODUCTION

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

. 1. This Petition concerns the Mitsubishi Cement Corporation South Quarry 2 Expansion Project ("the Project"), a planned 153.6-acre expansion of Mitsubishi's operations, to 3 be located almost entirely.on Forest Service land within the San Bernardino National Forest. 4
The 153.6 acres would consist of a new 128-acre quarry, a 2.7-acre landscape berm, a 22.2-acre 5 haul road which would be 1.8 miles long, and a temporary construction road of 0.7 acres. Figure 6 of this Petition provides an outline of the Project site, reflecting that it is within the San 7 Bernardino National Forest boundaries as shown by the green line. 8

24 2. The Mitsubishi Cement Corporation complex is currently comprised of the
25 Cushenbury Cement Plant, where coment is manufactured, as well as the East Pit, which has
26 apparently been mined for some time, and the West Pit, which Respondents authorized
27 Mitsubishi to open up in 2004 in order to allow the Cushenbury Cement Plant to continue
28 operating. Cement manufacture requires a mixture of both high- and low-grade limestone.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 2

2 When Respondents conducted CEQA reviey for the West Pit project in 2004, they represented
that it would be sufficient to produce all the necessary limestone for the Cement Plant, but
according to the Draft Environmental Impact Report/Statement ("DEIR/S") for the South Quarry
4 Project here at issue, shortly after that review was completed, in 2009 and 2010, Mitsubishi
5 concluded that the West Pit did not contain enough high-grade limestone to ensure continued
6 operation of the Plant. The DEIR/S therefore indicated that the first objective of the Project was
7 to supply high-grade limestone to the Cushenbury Cement Plant for the next 120 years.

3. Figure 2 of this Petition reflects that the Project requires a modification of the
9

10 U.S. Forest Service's Scenic Integrity Objectives, from "High" to "Low," in the purple area

11 reflected in the map. The green-shaded area (and the purple-shaded region) reflect areas where
the Scenic Integrity Objectives are currently listed as High.

2 4. The DEIR/S and Final Environmental Impact Report/Final Environmental Impact

3 Statement ("FEIR/S") for the Project (sometimes collectively, the "EIR") failed to comply with

4 CEQA's mandates in a number of respects:

5 It failed to analyze a reasonable range of alternatives, it engaged in a result-

6 oriented discussion of alternatives, and it failed to specifically select an alternative

7 as the proposed Project,

8 It contained an inadequate Project Description because it did not analyze the
predictable need for upgrades to Mitsubishi's Cushenbury Cement Plant as a 9

10 result of the extension of operations that the Project's new mining area

11 contemplates, and an inadequate discussion of potentially significant impacts to

12 Air Quality and Greenhouse Gases because it refused to analyze the

13 environmental impacts resulting from the operation of that Plant,

14 It failed to contain an adequate discussion of potentially significant impacts with

15 respect to Air Quality, Biological Resources, Greenhouse Gases, Hydrology and

16 Water Resources, and Energy,

17 It failed to adequately analyze cumulative impacts,

18 It failed to adopt all feasible mitigations with respect to significant impacts to the

19 Cushenbury herd of Nelson's Bighorn Sheep, which are on an extinction

20 trajectory,

21 It failed to adopt all feasible mitigation measures with respect to the listed

22 carbonate plants, which should have been subject to the Carbonate Habitat

23 Management Strategy ("CHMS"), and

24 It failed to adequately mitigate for impacts on the area of the Project by requiring

25 the withdrawal of BLM lands be permanent, and that it include parcels contiguous

26 to those containing listed carbonate plants.

27 5. Petitioner, Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance ("Petitioner" or
28 "GSEJA"), brings this action on its own behalf and on behalf of the general public as a private
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 4

attorney general in order to challengs the approvals at issue in this case.
2
6. Specifically, Petitioner seeks to invalidate the Board of Supervisors' actions on
3 August 11, 2020:
4
a. approving the Project Water Supply Assessment;
5
b. certifying the Joint Environmental Impact Report/Environmental Impact
6
Statement;
7
C. adopting the recommended CEQA Findings and Statement of Overriding
8 Considerations;

d. adopting the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program;
10
e. approving the Reclamation Plan, subject to the Conditions of Approval;
11 f. adopting the findings for approval of the Reclamation Plan; and
12
g. Directing the Clerk to file the Notice of Determination.
13 II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
14 7. This Court has jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and
15 1094.5. The Court has jurisdiction of CEQA matters pursuant to Pub. Resources Code sections
16 21168, 21168.5, and 21168.9.
17 8. Venue is proper in this Court because the County of San Bernardino is within the
18 jurisdiction of this County and the Project is located here as well, so the actions giving rise to the
19 causes of action herein transpired in San Bernardino County. See Code of Civil Procedure
20 sections 393 and 394.
21 9. This action is timely filed within 30 days of the posting of the Notice of
22 Determination under CEQA on August 14, 2020.
23 10. Petitioner has exhausted its administrative remedies by commenting on the
24 Project prior to the close of the public hearing on the Project before the filing of the dispositive
25 Notice of Determination, in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21177(b).
26 11. The dispositive Notice of Determination is that which was filed after the matter
27 has been appealed to the agency with the ultimate land use authority, which in this case was the
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 5

1

•N Sani Bernardino County Board of Supervisors. Petitioner duly appealed this matter to that entity
upon the Planning Commission's approval of the Project. The County of San Bernardino has
3 previously taken the position in litigation under CEQA in San Bernardino Superior Court with
4 GSEJA that notices of determination filed after a decision by a subsidiary body a are a legal
5 "nullity;" hence, the Notice of Determination filed after the Planning Commission action on this
6 Project was a nullity.
7 12. Petitioner has complied with CEQA, Pub. Resources Code section 21167.5, by
8 filing and serving with this Petition for Writ of Mandate a Notice of Intent to File (a true and
9 correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A). Petitioner has complied with CEQA,
10 Pub. Resources Code section 21167.6, in notifying the County of Petitioner's election to prepare
11 the administrative record. Petitioner has complied with CEQA's requirement that Petitioner
12 notify the Attorney General of the commencement of this action pursuant to Pub. Resources
13 Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388; a copy of Petitioner's Notice to
14 the Attorney General will be filed along with the present Petition.
15
III. PARTIES
16 13. Petitioner Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance ("GSEJA") is an
17 advocacy organization devoted to the preservation of the environment as well as the promotion
18 of safe and healthy communities. Constituents of GSEJA reside in San Bernardino County and
19 the surrounding area and recreate in the San Bernardino National Forest, and they would be
20 irreparably harmed by the Project's environmental impacts. GSEJA submitted multiple sets of
21 comments on the Project. GSEJA brings this action on behalf of the public and is acting as a
22 private attorney general conferring a significant benefit on the general public or a large class of
23 persons under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.
24 14. Respondent San Bernardino County ("County") is a public entity and the lead
25 agency for the Project under CEQA. County is the agency charged with the authority of
26 regulating and administering land use and development within its territory in compliance with
27 the provisions of its General Plan and zoning ordinances as well as applicable provisions of state

IV.
17 STATEMENT OF FACTS AND COMMON ALLEGATIONS

18 A. Inadequate Alternatives Analysis: A Result-Oriented Discussion, No Reasonable

19 Range of Alternatives, and Failure to Identify the Proposed Project

20 1. Result-Oriented Discussion.

19,
21 The EIR'S selection of alternatives and its discussion of them was entirely result-

22 oriented in favor of Mitsubishi's Project. This violated CEQA's requirement that alternatives

23 selected for analysis should "feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project but

24 [should] avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project." See CEQA

25 Guidelines ("Guidelines") § 15126.6(a) (emphasis supplied); see also Guidelines § 15126.6(b)

26 ("the discussion of alternatives shall focus on alternatives to the project or its location which

27 are capable of avoiding or substantially lessening any significant effects of the project")

28 (emphasis supplied). See also Pub. Res. Code § 21002 (Legislature's finding that "the

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA).... 7

procedures required by this division are intended to assist public agencies in systematically
2 identifying both the significant effects of proposed projects and the feasible alternatives .. .
3 which will avoid or substantially lessen such significant effects"). Respondents violated this rule
4 by selecting for analysis only alternatives that had worse impacts on Air Quality and Greenhouse
5 Gas ("GHG") emissions, and similar impacts on Scenic Resources and Biological Resources,
6 compared to the Project itself. This selection of alternatives with impacts which were worse
7 overall made the Project a fait accompli.
8 2. No Reasonable Range of Alternatives.
9
20. CEQA also requires that an EIR analyze a "reasonable range of potentially
10 feasible alternatives that will foster informed decisionmaking and public participation."
11 Guidelines § 15126.6(a). The alternatives Mitsubishi and Respondents chose did not represent a
12 reasonable range. As Petitioner pointed out, there was only one actual Alternative analyzed
13 beside the required No Project Alternative, which was the Partial Implementation Alternative,
14 and it did not reduce impacts on Scenery or Biological Resources, and it had significantly worse
15 Air Quality and GHG impacts.
16 21. Specifically, the "range" of the Alternatives analyzed in the DEIR/S was as
17 follows:
18 Alternative 1 - Proposed Action, which the DEIR/S described as "the project
19 proposed in the Plan of Operations," which would involve a planned 153.6-acre
20 expansion of Mitsubishi's operations, to be located almost entirely on Forest
21 Service land within the San Bernardino National Forest. The 153.6 acres would
22 consist of new 128-acre quarry, a 2.7-acre landscape berm, a 22.2-acre haul road
23 which would be 1.8 miles long, and a temporary construction road of 0.7 acres.
24 Alternative 1 assumed operation of the Cushenbury Cement Plant for 120 years
25 based on the South Quarry's anticipated yield of high-grade limestone.
26 Alternative 2 • Partial Implementation Alternative, which would involve
27 disturbance of an area of approximately 20 acres less, or roughly 133.6 acres.
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 8

. 1 The Partial Implementation Alternative would involve mining in the new South 2 Quarry for only 40 years, after which trucks would bring high-grade limestone in 3
4 from off site. The DEIR/S anticipated that due to the 150 truck trips per day the
consultant anticipated would be required, Air Quality and Greenhouse Gas 5 impacts from this Alternative after year 40 could be significant. Impacts to 6 Biological and Scenic Resources were expected to be the same. The Partial 7 Implementation Alternative did not reduce any of the significant impacts of the
Project.
9 Altermative 3 - No Action/No Project Alternative, which was required to be 10 analyzed under CEQA. While most "no project" alternatives analysis involves 11 assuming that there will be no development, Respondents assumed in this No 12 Project Alternative that high-grade limestone would be trucked to the Cushenbury 13 Cement Plant for the next 120 years from unidentified other mines. The DEIR/S 14 assumed that this would require 150 trucks a day, every day, for that period of 15 time, and concluded that this could lead to significant Air Quality and GHG 16 impacts, although it did nothing to quantify them. In response to public comment, 17 Respondents identified three off-site sources for the limestone in the FEIR/S and
18 reflected that GHG impacts would exceed the Mojave Desert Air Quality 19 Management District's ("MDAQMD's") annual threshold for any one of the three 20 sources, while trucking limestone from one of those sources would exceed 21 MDAQMD's Air Quality regional thresholds for PM1o and PM2.s.
22
22. The EIR's discussion of alternatives did not represent a reasonable range under 23 the CEQA statute and Guidelines, which recognize that
24

25 Because an EIR must identify ways to mitigate or avoid the significant effects that a project may have on the environment, the discussion of alternatives shall focus
26 on alternatives to the project or its location which are capable of avoiding or lessening any significant effects of the project, even if these alternatives would
27 impede to some degree the attainment of the project objectives, or would be more costly.

28 Guidelines § 15126.6(b) (emphasis supplied); see Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21002.1 (EIRs,
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 9

1

2 including their alternatives analysis, should focus on ways to mitigate or avoid a project's

3 significant impacts). As Petitioner pointed out, Respondents only identified one alternative to
the "Proposed Action," which was the "Partial Implementation" Alternative," which did not
reduce the significant impacts to Biological or Scenic Resources, and in fact added potentially 5 significant impacts to Air Quality and GHGs.
6
23. Respondents' alternatives analysis could have encompassed a reasonable range by 7
considering alternative quarry sites, a smaller project, or different timelines, as the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency proposed in its comments on scoping for the DEIR/S.
9
24.
10 In the FEIR/S, to support their contention that they had analyzed a reasonable
range of alternatives, Respondents cited to alternatives identified but not carried forward for
11 analysis in the DEIR/S. CEQA Guidelines section 15126.6's requirement of a reasonable range 12 of alternatives is for the alternatives actually discussed in a DEIR, SO that the public can 13

14 comment upon those alternatives. Further, none of the alternatives rejected from further

15 analysis, which received cursory notation in the FEIR/S after the public comment period was

16 over, considered reduced development in any way,
3. Failure to Identify the Proposed Action as the Project.
17
25. Petitioner commented that the DEIR/S should have been revised to reflect that 18

19 Alternative was the "Proposed Project," but Respondents doubled down in the FEIR/S,
contending that:
20

21 The alternatives are identified as alternatives because a decision regarding the preferred alternative and the ultimate decision on approval of the Project has not
22 yet been made. Renaming the alternatives in the Draft EIR/EIS would not foster more-informed decision making by the decision makers or the public.
23 As Petitioner pointed out in its comments on the FEIR/S, this approach of not identifying the 24 Proposed Project in the circulated EIR ran headlong into CEQA's requirement that a lead
25 agency must provide a stable project definition, because "a failure to identify or select a project 26 at all 'impairs the public's right and ability to participate in the environmental review process.M

2 Washoe Meadows Cmty. v. Dept. of Parks & Recreation (2017) 17 Cal. App. 5th 277, 288.

3 B. Inadequate Project Description

26.
4 As another commenter on the DEIR/S noted, under CEQA a "project" is supposed

5 to be the "whole of an action" which will result in reasonably foresecable direct or indirect

6 physical changes to the environment. Guidelines, § 15378(a). The DEIR/S's Project Description

7 was flawed in at least two respects. First, it was focused on mining a total of 2.6 million tons per

8 year ("MTPY") of ore from the East Pit, West Pit, and South Quarry together, based on a shifting a

9 of 1.3 MTPY of production from the East and West Pits to the South Quarry, even though no

10 mitigation measure or condition of approval actually prohibited Mitsubishi from continuing

11 production of 2.6 MTPY from the East and West Pits alone, and adding another 1.3 MTPY of

12 production from the South Quarry,

13 27. Respondents contended that Mitsubishi's Title V Clean Air Act permit for the

14 Cushenbury Cement Plant would limit its production of limestone to the 2.6 MTPY analyzed, but

15 nothing would preclude Mitsubishi from selling its excess production to a third party, among

16 other things.

28.
17 The second reason the Project Description was flawed was that it failed to include

18 the emissions from the Cushenbury Cement Plant or the multiple upgrades that Plant would

19 likely require to continue operating. The continued emissions of the Plant were a predictable

20 result of the Project and should have been analyzed, including their attendant GHG impacts.

21 C. Inadequacy of Discussion: Air Quality, GHGs, Biological Resources, Hydrology

22 and Water Resources, and Euergy

23 1. Air Quality.

24 29. The DEIR/S failed to properly assess Air Quality impacts because it compared

25 future emissions to those permitted under the 2004 West Pit EIR, rather than to present

26 emissions, which were nowhere disclosed in the DEIR/S. The California Supreme Court has

27 been emphatic that CEQA requires the analysis of actual conditions on the ground rather than

28 what might be allowed by permits. In various places, the DEIR/S and FEIR/S make clear that

*. - ks PETITION FOR WRTT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 11

1

2 there is no current production from the West Pit, and there is limited production from the East
Pit. See, e.g., DEIR at 2-8 (section 2.3.2.6). 3
30.
4 The DEIR/S's Air Quality analysis also failed because it did not reflect any of the
emissions from the Cushenbury Cement Plant, although the Project was explicitly designed to 5
allow that Cement Plant to continue operations.
6
2. GHGs.
7
31.
8 Based on its flawed Project Description, the DEIR/S failed to include the
emissions from the Cushenbury Cement Plant in its assessment of GHGs. The DEIR/S also 9

10 reached the conclusory assertion that GHG impacts from the Partial Implementation Alternative

11 or the No Action Alternative would be significant based on truck hauling, without providing any
detail whatsoever to
12 support that assertion. While the FEIR/S provided some detail in support of

13 those claims, it is discussion in the DEIR which prompts public comment, and the DEIR/S

14 should have been recirculated with the information provided in the FEIR/S. The DEIR/S further

15 made the insupportable argument that the Project was consistent with the County's GHG

16 Reduction Plan simply because there are no elements to that Plan which specifically focus on
cement manufacturing plants. The DEIR/S also made the unfounded assertion that vehicular and
17

18 other sources of GHGs need not be assessed or mitigated because they are already "capped" by
the state's Cap and Trade Program,
19 3. Biological Resources.
20
32.
21 Another set of commenters, the Center for Biological Diversity ("CBD") and the

22 California Native Plant Society ("CNPS"), provided extensive comments on the inadequacy of

23 the DEIR/S's discussion of impacts to Biological Resources. Those comments pointed out in

24 particular that the DEIR/S's discussion of impacts to the Cushenbury herd of Nelson's Bighorn

25 Sheep and of impacts to protected plants under the Carbonate Habitat Management Strategy

26 ("CHMS") were both insufficient under CEQA.

33. The California Supreme Court recently clarified what a number of Court of 27

28 Appeal decisions previously made clear: CEQA requires not just the acknowledgement of a

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 12

1
significant impact, but also a discussion of the nature and extent of such an impact. The 2

3 DEIR/S failed to comply with this requirement. With regard to the Cushenbury herd of the

4 Nelson's Bighorn Sheep, the DEIR/S's discussion of the impacts of Alternatives 1 and 2 was

5 entirely conclusory. And with regard to the impacts of the Project on the CHIMS, the DEIR/S

6 was entirely disingenuous, asserting that the Project "has been designed to be consistent with the

7 CHMS," even though CBD and CNPS pointed out that the Furnace Unit of the CHMS has never
been activated by the addition to the Habitat Reserve of all of the following as required by the 8
CHMS:
9

10 100% of the Occupied Habitat that occurs in Stage 1 Priority Areas; 85% of the Suitable Habitat that occurs in Stage Priority Areas; and .. sufficient
11 additional land to preserve such Occupied and Suitable Habitat to preserve such Occupied and Suitable Habitat in one contiguous patch ("Connective Land").
12 CHMS (Apr. 29, 2003), included in Scoping Report, DEIR/S Appendix a-1, at 23. The Project,
13 which would impinge on Occupied Habitat and Stage 1 Priority Areas, is not consistent with the
14 above requirement. As these commenters noted, the Habitat Reserve had not been assembled, so
15 the Project could not be considered "consistent" with the CHMS.
16 34. Because the Project was not consistent with the CHMS, the DEIR/S proposed two
17 "modifications" to the CHMS. DEIR/S at 3.3-77-3.3-78. As CBD and CNPS noted, at least the
18 first of these "modifications" required an "Amendment" to the CHMS pursuant to CHMS section
19 17(b), such that it required:
20

21 (i) the approval of all MOU Parties that could be adversely affected by the proposed Amendment and (ii) the concurrence of the USFWS,
22 CHMS, included in Scoping Report, DEIR/'S Appendix a-1, at 39, because it purported to allow
23 encroachment on land identified under the CHMS as Stage 1 Priority Habitat Reserve, including
24 Occupied and Suitable Habitat. Mitsubishi did not pursue the required steps for an Amendment.
25 In the FEIR/S, Respondents took the position that this change was in the nature of a mere
26 "Administrative Change" under CHMS section 17(a). This was a serious misinterpretation of the
27 CHMS, which allowed the Resource Management Agencies to make "adjustments and
28 modifications .. in their discretion," "so long as they are consistent with other provisions of the PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) . 13

2 CHMS." CHMS section 17(a). Since the Project meant to allow destruction of Occupied and

3 Suitable Habitat in Stage 1 Priority Areas in the Furnace Unit before that Unit was activated, it

4 •was inconsistent with other provisions of the CHMS, and it required an Amendment.'

35. The DEIR/S should have been recirculated because the FEIR/S disclosed that
5 there was a Supplemental Jurisdictional Delineation prepared in December 2018 at CDFW's
6

7 request, which disclosed that there would be impacts to 0.74 acres of State jurisdictional waters,

8 as opposed to the 0.08 acres acknowledged in the DEIR/S. The Supplemental Delineation also

9 disclosed that the Project would impact 3,622 linear feet of streambed, as opposed to the 1,231

10 linear feet disclosed in the DEIR/S. This was significant new information under CEQA.
4. Hydrology and Water Resources.
11
36.
12 CBD and CNPS also commented on the inadequacy of discussion regarding

13 groundwater levels and the Project's water demands, given that the Project proposed to use one

14 or more wells for Mitsubishi to extract the water required for Project operations. The DEIR/S

15 asserted that groundwater elevation ranged from 4,107 feet msl to 4,141 msl, and that "data

16 indicate that over the past several years there has been a relative balance between replenishment

17 and discharge." DEIR/S at 3.8-10. CBD and CNPS noted that this data was taken from Fall

18 2011 and Spring 2012, before the County began to experience drought. FEIR/S Comment 16-24.

19 In the FEIR, Respondents acknowledged that water levels have declined since 2012, but they still

20 failed to provide up-to-date groundwater levels. The FEIR/S told readers that they could

21 calculate groundwater levels themselves by subtracting measurements in Figure 5 of a May 30,

22 2019 groundwater report from the well elevation of the wells as disclosed in Appendix A of the

23 report, but neither the report nor its Appendix was provided. Further, according to Supreme

24 Court and other precedent, the information should have been provided in the text of the DEIR/S,

25 not in appendices and appendices to appendices.

26 CHMS section 17(a) did indicate that "Administrative changes" could include "modification
27 of the Habitat Inventory, however, this merely meant modifications to the Habitat Inventory by the Forest Service pursuant to section 14(d) of the CHMS, which had to be based on
28 factors such as inaccuracy of prior survey information or naturally occurring changes in environmental conditions and/or species dispersal patterns. PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) [4

~ 37.
2 CBD and CNPS also commented (FEIR/S Comment 16-25) that the DEIR/S

3 failed to support its assertion that the Project would use 105.3 acre feet of water per year ("afy"),

4 relying on an appendix that provided no basis for the calculation. The FEIR/S provided entirely
new calculations leading to a cumulative 101.3 afy need for the South Quarry and West Pit

6 projects. While Respondents asserted in Master Response 1 in the FEIR/S that this

7 "clarification" did not require recirculation, because the DEIR/S's higher number still would not

8 lead to a significant impact. This conclusion was false because the FEIR/S disclosed that
Respondents were discounting water used for mining operations and only including road

10 watering, and the DEIR/S and FEIR/S disclosed that mining operations are currently limited.

11 Additionally, the failure to support the original calculation in the DEIR should have led to

12 recirculation because the DEIR/S "was so fundamentally and basically inadequate" on this point

13 that "meaningful public review and comment were precluded." Guidelines § 15088.5(a)(4). In

14 other words, commenters would have been able to address the omission of water used for mining

15 operations had they known about it before the issuance of the FEIR/S.

16 38. Respondents also asserted in the DEIR/S that the water to be used for the Project

17 would not lead to significant impacts because it would fall within Mitsubishi's Free Production

18 Allowance ("FPA") under the Mojave Basin Judgment. As CBD pointed out, this argument

19 improperly assumed that the FPA represents a CEQA threshold of significance, and the Mojave

20 Basin Judgment was intended for the benefit of downstream users as opposed to preventing

21 overdraft conditions. As Petitioner pointed out, the FEIR/S was required to comply with the

22 present CEQA Guidelines threshold, which inquires not only whether the Project will lead to a

23 lowering of the groundwater table but also whether the Project would interfere substantially with

24 groundwater recharge such that the project may impede sustainable groundwater management of

25 the basin. The FEIR/S entirely failed to address this issue.

26 5. Energy.

27 39. The City DEIR/S failed to analyze energy conservation measures, and it faile o

28 describe the transportation energy impacts of the Project, including those relating to the diesel

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 15

2 fuel to be used by the Project for the transportation of ore under all three alternatives.

3 Respondents claimed that the Project "would not lead to significant transportation impacts," so
that they did not have to analyze the consumption of transportation fuels. -This was baseless.
4
The question for energy purposes is the consumption of fuel. Respondents also contended that
5

6 the energy associated with vehicle usage was "presented by truck and as a total in the Air Quality
Study," but the cited Tables reflected emissions factors, not fuel usage. Respondents' energy
analysis was wholly inadequate under Ukiah Citizens for Safety First v. City of Ukiah (2016) 248
Cal. App. 4th 173, 209.
D. Inadequate Cumulative Impacts and Growth Inducing Impaets Analysis
10 40. CBD properly commented that the DEIR/S was inadequate for failing to define
11 the scope of the geographic area subject to cumulative impact analysis for each effect as required
12 by Guidelines § 15130(b)(3). While the FEIR/S said the area of analysis was illustrated in
13 Figure 3.1-1, this figure did not delineate a separate area of analysis for each impact.
14 Additionally, Figure 3.1-1 did not map several of the cumulative projects listed in Table 3.1-1, as
15 it should have.
16 41. And the DEIR/S failed to properly address growth inducement. Mining allowed
17 in the Project area is likely to encourage the development of other mines in the Project area.
18 Indeed, the prior West Pit EIR failed to acknowledge the subsequent need for the South Quarry
19 EIR here at issue, and the West Pit EIR itself was the expansion of another project.
20 E. Failure to Adopt All Feasible Mitigation
21
42.
22 CEQA requires that lead agencies adopt all feasible mitigations for significant

23 environmental impacts. Respondents failed to do this in at least two respects.

43.
24 First, commenters suggested that Respondents require the construction of a bridge

25 over Highway 18, which passes the Project site, to allow for crossings of Nelson's bighorn

26 sheep. The DEIR/S acknowledged that there would be a significant adverse impact to the

27 Cushenbury herd of the sheep, which is on an extinction trajectory, having been reduced to about

28 15 members, when it used to contain 40 to 50 in the 1990's. In the FEIR/S, Respondents

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 16

1

2 nevertheless refused to provide a wildlife bridge over the Highway based on the supposed

3 comment from a CDFW biologist that it would be ineffective. CBD cited evidence to the
contrary in its comments, and Respondents failed to refute that evidence. •: 4
44.
5 The DEIR/S and FEIR/S also failed to adopt all feasible mitigation with respect to
the listed carbonate plants which were the subject of the CHMS, and Respondents failed to 6

7 require a permanent withdrawal of BLM lands as mitigation, or to require the withdrawal of
contiguous lands to the Occupied and Suitable Habitat for those plants. 8 F. Inadequate Discussion as to Whether the Project Is Even Viable 9 45. CBD noted that the West Pit 2004 EIR represented that that project contained 10 adequate limestone to feed the Cement Plant, whereas now Mitsubishi has come back and is
11 asserting that it does not. This indicates that present CEQA review is not adequate because past
12 review was not either. Respondents asserted that the test results for the new and old mining
13 areas are proprietary, but an EIR/S requires disclosure regarding the viability of a proposed 14 project, and the County and the public were apparently misled by the 2004 West Pit EIR,
15 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
16
Recirculation of the DEIR
17 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000 et seq.] 18 46. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1-45 as if set forth in full. 19
47. A DEIR must be recirculated if there is the addition of significant new 20 information after public notice is given or if the DEIR is so fundamentally and basically 21 inadequate that meaningful public review and comment were precluded. Here, as alleged above,
22 the DEIR/S was fundamentally and basically inadequate in that, among other things, it:
23 Failed to include a proper assessment in the circulated Jurisdictional Delineation, and 24 Failed to include the assumptions underlying Mitsubishi's need for water associated with
25 the Project.
26 Failed to include all relevant information regarding GHGs.
27 These comments were raised by Petitioner and others before the agency acted upon the Project. 28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CFQA) 17

1. 48.
2 Recirculation is also required where the drafters of the EIR are confronted with

3 significant new information after public notice is given on the DEIR.
49.
4 Recirculstion of an EIR requires notice pursuant to Guidelines section 15087 and
consultation pursuant to Guidelines section 15086. Notice under section 15087 means the 5 agency must provide for a new review period and include a list of significant effects anticipated 6

7 from the project. Consultation means that the agency must request comment from responsible
agencies and trustee agencies as well as any other state, federal or local agencies with 8 jurisdiction over any resource which may be impacted by the Project.
9
50. There was significant information omitted from the DEIR/S on the issues
10

11 identified above and others, and Respondents failed to require recirculation.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
12 Failure to Analyze All Potentially Significant Impacts/Inadequacy of Discussion
13 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000 et seq.l 14
51.
15 Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 50 as if fully set
forth.
16
52. The DEIR failed to assess significant impacts with respect to, and/or contained 17 inadequate discussion as to:
18
9 Air Quality
19
. GHGs;
20 Biological Resources;
21 Hydrology and Water Resources; and
22
Energy.
23
53.
24 The EIR's conclusions were not based on substantial evidence and represented a
failure to adequately disclose impacts, and Respondents' process in reviewing these impacts 25 represented a failure to proceed by law.

54.
5
forth. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 53 as if fully set

7 The DEIR faited to include critical information in the DEIR itself, burying key

8 elemnents in Appendices, in violation of established precedent, and in violation of CEQA.

9 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

10 Failure to Adequately Mitigate All Potentially Significant Impacts

11 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000 et seq.]
56.
12 forth. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 55 as if fully set

13
57.
14 CEQA requires an agency to adopt feasible mitigation measures that will

15 substantially lessen or avoid the project's potentially significant impacts and to describe those

16 mitigation measures in the DEIR. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21081(a), 21100(b)(3); Guidelines

17 § 15126.4. A lead agency may not conclude that an impact is significant and unavoidable

18 without requiring the imposition of all feasible mitigation measures to reduce impacts to less

19 than significant levels. Guidelines §§ 15126.4, 15091.

58.
20 The DEIR failed to adequately mitigate for multiple impacts, including as to the

21 Cushenbury herd of Nelson's bighorn sheep and rare and listed carbonate plants.

22 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

23 Inadequate Statement of Overriding Considerations

24 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq.]
59.
25 forth. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 58 as if fully set

26 60.
27 CEQA requires that an agency must adopt a "statement of overriding

28 considerations" for any significant effects which have not been mitigated to a level of

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 19

16 insignificance by mitigation measures or the adoption of alternatives. The agency must find
2 "that specific overriding economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits of the project
3 outweigh the significant effects on the environment." Pub. Res. Code § 21081(b). .
4
61. The statement of overriding considerations must be based on substantial evidence
5 in the record. Pub. Res. Code 21081.5; Guidelines § 15093(b).
6
62. Here Respondents' statement of overriding considerations was not based on
7 substantial evidence.
8 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

Inadequate Project Description

11 63. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 62 as if fully set
12 forth.
13 64. CEQA requires a finite and stable Project Description in an EIR.
14
65. The EIR. failed to adequately describe this Project, among other things failing to
15 it acknowledge that it anticipated the operation of the Cushenbury Cement Plant for 120 years or to
16 assess impacts associated with that continued operation.
17 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION
18 Inadequate Alternatives Analysis
19 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq.]
20 66. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 65 as if fully set
21 forth.
22 67. Respondents failed to properly select or analyze alternatives for the Project in the
23 DEIR/S because they:
24 Failed to assess alternatives that could lessen the impacts of the Project;
25 Failed to identify which alternative the Project actually was; and
26 Failed to assess a reasonable range of alternatives.
27 68. The failure to adequately analyze alternatives violated CEQA's informational
