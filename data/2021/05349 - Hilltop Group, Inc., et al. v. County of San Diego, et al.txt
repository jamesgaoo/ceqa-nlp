VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioners HILLTOP GROUP, INC. and ADJ HOLDINGS, LLC (collectively

3 "Petitioners") own property (the "Site") in the unincorporated area of San Diego County that has
4 been designated and zoned for industrial uses since 2011, when the Board of Supervisors for the

5 County of San Diego adopted a General Plan Update (the €2011 GPU") amending certain land uses

6 within the County. When the County approved the 2011 GPU, it also certified a Final
7 Environmental Impact Report that analyzed the impacts of the updated plan, including impacts

8 associated with the new land use and zoning designations.

9 2. In June of 2012, Petitioners submitted to respondent COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO
10 (the "County") an application to develop a portion of the Site as a construction debris recycling

11 facility, known as "North County Environmental Resources" ("NCER"). As a construction debris

12 processing and a recycling facility, NCER is a permitted use under the Site's I-3 (Heavy Industrial)

13 land use designation and its M54 (General Impact Industrial) zoning designation. Because NCER is

14 consistent with the Site's underlying land use and zoning designations, and because the 2011 GPU

15 was the subject of a certified EIR, the project qualifies for an exemption under the California
16 Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21083.3(b), and
17 CEQA Guidelines section 15183.

18 3. CEQA Guidelines section 15183(a) mandates that a lead agency, when considering a

19 project that is consistent with the site's underlying general plan and/or zoning designations for

20 which an EIR was certified "shall not require additional environmental review, except as might be

21 necessary to examine whether there are project-specific significant effects which are peculiar to the

22 project or its site.33

23 4. Petitioners expressly requested that the County apply the section 15183 exemption to
24 NCER project, thereby streamlining the County's review of the Project. Before it would agree to

25 process the Project as exempt under section 15183, the County subjected the Project to eight (8)
26 years of environmental analysis, much of which is set forth in more than a dozen technical studies

27 covering issues such as aesthetics and visual impacts, biological resources, air quality and
28 greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions, traffic, noise, hydrology and drainage, cultural resources, tribal

2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

resources, and geotechnical impacts. The County also held public meetings and workshops on the

2 Project, requesting interested persons to present evidence of significant impacts "peculiar" to the
Project or the Site. After receiving and reviewing all data for the Project, the staff at the County's
Department of Planning and Development Services ("DPS") determined that the Project did, in fact,

5 a qualify for a CEQA exemption under section 15183, as there was no substantial evidence showing

6 the Project would cause a significant and peculiar impact that could not be mitigated through

7 application of the County's uniform policies and standards.

8 5. The County's Zoning Administrator affirmed staff's conclusions during a public

9 hearing held on June 25, 2020. Four members of the public appealed the Zoning Administrator's
10 determination to the County Planning Commission, but the Planning Commission, citing the

11 evidence in the record showing no significant peculiar impact, denied the appeals and affirmed the

12 Zoning Administrator's decision. The appellants then appealed to the respondent BOARD OF
13 SUPERVISORS FOR THE COUNTY OF SAN DIEGO (the "Board"), which heard the matter on

14 May 5, 2021. At the hearing, neither the appellants nor any other person presented substantial

15 evidence showing that the Project would result in potentially significant and peculiar impacts that

16 could not be mitigated through imposition of uniform standards and policies. Nevertheless, the

17 Board granted the appeals and demanded that an EIR be prepared for the NCER project, despite the

18 Project meeting all criteria for the section 15183 exemption.

19 6. In failing to apply the section 15183 exemption to the NCER project, the County

20 and the Board of Supervisors iolated the mandatory directives set forth in the CEQA Guidelines

21 and in Public Resources Code section 21083.3(b). Consequently, the County and the County Board

22 of Supervisors failed to proceed in the manner required by law and thus committed a prejudicial

23 abuse of discretion that only this court can remedy.

24 7. For these reasons, among others, Petitioners request that this court issue an order

25 directing the County Board of Supervisors to (i) rescind its decision of May 5, 2021 requiring an

26 EIR for the NCER Project; (ii) deny the appeals; and (iii) affirm the decision of the Zoning
27 Administrator applying the section 15183 exemption to the NCER Project.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 PARTIES

2 8. Petitioner Hilltop Group, Inc. ("Hilltop") is a California corporation, headquartered

3 in San Marcos, California. Hilltop is one of the applicants for the NCER project and participated

4 extensively in the environmental review process for the Project. By prosecuting this action and

5 ensuring the County complies with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and the California Planning and

6 Zoning Law, Hilltop will confer a substantial benefit on the public.

7 9. Petitioner ADJ Holdings, LLC ("ADJ Holdings") is a California limited liability

8 company, headquartered in San Marcos, California. It is the owner of the project site and, like

9 Hilltop, one of the applicants for the NCER project. ADJ Holdings participated extensively in the

10 environmental review process for the Project. By prosecuting this action and ensuring the County

11 complies with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and the California Planning and Zoning Law, ADJ

12 Holdings will confer a substantial benefit on the public.

13 10. Respondent County of San Diego ("County") is a local agency with land use
14 permitting authority over the Site and the Project. The County is also the "lead agency" for purposes

15 of complying with the procedural and substantive requirements of CEQA and the CEQA

16 Guidelines, as they might apply to the Project. Such procedural and substantive requirements

17 include mandatory application of CEQA exemptions to qualifying projects. The County was
18 responsible for reviewing the NCER project to determine whether it qualified for a CEQA

19 exemption under Public Resources Code section 21083.3(b) and CEQA Guidelines section 15183.

20 It was the County, through the actions of the County Board of Supervisors on May 5, 2021, that

21 ultimately decided not to apply the requested exemption to NCER, even though the evidence

22 developed and reviewed by the County showed that the Project qualified for the exemption. The

23 County, as the land use agency with jurisdiction over the project Site, also is required to comply
24 with the procedural and substantive requirements of the California Planning and Zoning Law

25 (Govt. Code § 65000 et seq.) as it applies it to the Project and the Site.

26 11. Respondent San Diego County Board of Supervisors ("Board") is the elected
27 decision-making body for the County. It, too, must comply with the procedural and substantive

28 requirements of CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and the California Planning and Zoning Law. It was

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

the Board that on May 5, 2021, decided not to apply the CEQA Guidelines Section 15183

2 exemption to the NCER project, despite (i) substantial evidence showing that the Project qualified

3 for the exemption, and (ii) the lack of substantial evidence showing that the Project was ineligible

4 for the exemption.

5 12. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondent Does 1

6 through 10 and sue such respondents by fictitious names. Petitioners are informed and believe, and

7 on that basis allege, that the fictitiously named respondents are also responsible for the actions

8 described in this Petition. When the true identities and capacities of these respondents have been

9 determined, Petitioners will amend this petition, with leave of the court if necessary, to insert such

10 identities and capacities.

11 13. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Party Does 1

12 through 10 and sue such real parties by fictitious names. Petitioners are informed and believe, and

13 on that basis allege, that the fictitiously named real parties are directly and materially affected by

14 the actions described in this Petition. When the true identities and capacities of these real parties

15 have been determined, Petitioners will amend this petition, with leave of the court if necessary, to
16 insert such identities and capacities.

17 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

18 14. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 527, 1085, 1087, and 1094.5,

19 Public Resources Code section 21080.5, 21168, 21168.5, 21168.9, 30801, the San Diego County

20 Superior Court has initial jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate setting aside the County's decision

21 to (i) deny the requested CEQA exemption to the NCER Project, and (üi) require an EIR for the

22 Project.

23 15. The subject of this action, the NCER Project, is located in San Diego County.

24 Therefore, venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California in and

25 for the County of San Diego pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394.

26 16. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to filing this action and have

27 exhausted all available administrative remedies to the extent possible and required by law.

28 Specifically, Petitioners requested that the County issue a CEQA exemption for the NCER Project

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21083.3(b) and CEQA Guidelines section 15183.

2 Petitioners also provided to the County all requested technical information it demanded as part of its

3 review under section 15183. Further, Petitioners defended the Project and the proposed exemption
4 during hearings before the County Zoning Administrator, the County Planning Commission, and the

5 County Board of Supervisors. More specifically, Petitioners participated in the May 5, 2021,

6 County Board of Supervisor hearing during which the County Board, over the objections of

7 Petitioners, voted to (i) deny the proposed exemption and (ii) demand that an EIR for the Project be

8 prepared.

9 17. On May 26, 2021, Petitioners complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5

10 by emailing and mailing to Respondents (the County and Board of Supervisors) a letter stating that

11 Petitioners planned to file a Petition for Writ of Mandate seeking to invalidate the County's decision

12 to deny the proposed section 15183 exemption for NCER. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a true

13 and correct copy of that letter.

14 18. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6(b)(2), Petitioners elect to prepare

15 the record of proceedings in this action. Concurrently with this Petition, Petitioners will file with

16 this court notice of election to prepare the administrative record.

17 19. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law unless this court grants

18 the requested writ of mandate and orders the County to set aside its decision denying the section

19 15183 exemption. In the absence of such remedies, the County's unlawful failure to apply the

20 proposed section 15183 exemption will remain in violation of State law, and Petitioners will be

21 irreparably harmed. No money damages or other legal remedy will adequately compensate

22 Petitioners and their members for that harm.

23 20. This petition is timely filed.

24 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

25 21. The NCER project site is located immediately west of Interstate 15, directly south of

26 Mesa Rock Road and just north of the City of Escondido. The site consists of six contiguous

27 parcels totaling approximately 139.5 acres. The actual recycling facility, however, is quite small

28

6

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 and will be located entirely on 18 acres within one of the six - parcels - APN 187-100-37. This parcel

2 was formerly used by Caltrans as a "cut and fill" borrow pit during the construction of Interstate 15.

3 22. As part of the County's 2011 General Plan Update (GPU), the County Board of
4 Supervisors redesignated APN 187-100-37, along with APN 187-100-31 and APN-100-35, as High

5 Impact Industrial (I-3) and rezoned it from Rural Residential (RR) to General Impact Industrial

6 (M54). The impacts associated with the redesignation and rezone were assessed in the 2011 GPU's

7 EIR, which was certified and never challenged.

23. On June 12, 2012, the Petitioners submitted to the County their application for the

o NCER Project. As described in the application and in all subsequent County staff reports, the
10 Project is intended a to be a construction debris processing and recycling facility that will engage in

11 three forms of recycling: (1) tree waste chipping and grinding; (2) recycling of wood and

12 construction debris; and (3) recycling of concrete, asphalt, and inert material from demolition
13 projects. Each of these recycling activities is designed to reduce the amount of construction waste

14 that is transported to and deposited in the County's landfills. In this way, the NCER project

15 facilitates the County's solid waste reduction policies, goals, and objectives, as set forth in the

16 County's General Plan, Integrated Waste Management Plan, and Construction and Demolition

17 Diversion Program. Only pre-sorted, non-contaminated tree trimmings, wood, and inert

18 construction debris would be accepted for processing. The Project will not engage in composting,

19 nor will it accept solid waste, asbestos, or any hazardous waste or materials.

20 24. Between June 2012 and July 2013, County staff conducted an Initial Study of the
21 Project. Staff, however, failed to whether the Project qualified for exemption under Public

22 Resources section 21083.3(b) and/or CEQA Guidelines section 15183.

23 25. On July 15, 2013, following completion of the Initial Study, County staff informed

24 Petitioners that an EIR would be required for the Project. Petitioners, through their legal counsel,

25 asked County staff to specifically identify which project-related impacts triggered the need for an

26 EIR. Staff did not identify any such specific significant impact.

27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

26. On February 11, 2014, Petitioners provided technical studies to County staff as

2 instructed and then requested that the Project be processed as a Mitigated Negative Declaration.

3 Staff denied this request and insisted the Project required an EIR.

4 27. On September 4, 2014, the County a issued a Notice of Preparation (NOP) of an EIR

5 for the Project. Between September 2014 and May 2015, Petitioners, at the direction of County

6 staff, hired County-approved consultants to prepare a variety of technical studies for the Project.

7 28. On July 10, 2015, Petitioners, through their legal counsel, notified the County that

8 the NCER project is consistent with the site's land use and zoning designations, as established in the

9 2011 GPU and attendant EIR, and thus is entitled to a CEQA exemption under section 15183 of the

10 CEQA Guidelines.

[1 29. Between July 2015 and August 2017, County staff refused to process the requested

12 section 15183 exemption and continued to insist that the Project required an EIR. On August 25,
13 2017, County staff finally agreed that, with a few additional technical studies, the Project could be

14 processed pursuant to section 15183. At that point in time, Petitioners had already spent $214,831 in

15 County staff processing fees, $150,726 in consulting fees for technical studies, $80,238 in

16 engineering fees, and $82,971 in legal fees, for a grand total of $528,766.

17 30. In October and November of 2017, Petitioners consulted with interested Native

18 American Indian tribes regarding the NCER project.

19 31. In April 2018, Petitioners, through their legal counsel, submitted additional technical
20 reports addressing issues identified by County staff as requiring further review.

21 32. In June and July of 2018, County staff again asked for more studies and indicated

22 that an EIR for the Project might still be required. Petitioners provided the studies requested and

23 demanded that staff identify the specific "peculiar" and significant impacts that might disqualify the

24 Project from the section 15183 exemption. Staff was unable to do so. During this same period,

25 County staff informed Petitioners that the County would oversee a public review and comment

26 process for the Project. Petitioners objected on grounds that section 15183 projects are exempt from
27 CEQA's public review and comment requirements. Despite Petitioners' objections, the County held

28 public workshops on the Project, invited members of the public to submit comments, and prepared

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

responses to same. In effect, County staff made Petitioners go through the functional equivalent of

2 an EIR process, even though the Project qualified for a section 15183 exemption. This process took

3 an additional two years to complete.

4 33. In the spring of 2020, County staff announced that the Project and the proposed

5 section 15183 exemption would be considered by the County Zoning Administrator during a public

6 hearing scheduled for June 25, 2020. By that time, the following technical studies had been

7 prepared for the Project:

8 A Visual Impact Report, complete with visual simulations

9 Two Cultural Resource surveys

10 A Tribal Outreach and Consultation Memorandum

11 An Air Quality and Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Assessment

12 A Traffic Study

13 Two Noise Studies

14 A Biological Resource Assessment

15 A Gnatcatcher Survey and Movement Study
16 A Vegetation Map and Impact Study

17 A Hydrology and Drainage Study

18 A Geotechnical Analysis and Addendum

19 The County also required Petitioners to prepare a fire protection plan, a storm water management

20 plan, a vector control plan, and a hazardous materials "load check and materials" plan.

21 34. Because the NCER project is consistent with the Site's underlying land use and

22 zoning designations - I-3 (Heavy Industrial) and M54 (General Industrial) - it does not require a

23 general plan amendment, zone change, or use permit. Rather, it is a use permitted a by right pursuant

24 reason, the Zoning Administrator's sole task to County Zoning Ordinance section 6975(a). For this

25 during the June 25, 2020 hearing was to determine whether the Project qualified for the proposed

26 exemption under section 15183.

27 35, During the Zoning Administrator hearing, County staff issued a report
28 | recommending that the section 15183 exemption be applied to the Project, as staff had studied the

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

P Project thoroughly a and was unable to identified a "peculiar" significant impact that could not be

2 adequately mitigated through the application of uniform policies and measures. Staff did

3 recommend, however, that the Project's debris processing area be enclosed to ensure compliance

4 with County Zoning Ordinance section 6975(a)

5 36. At the June 25, 2020, hearing, the Zoning Administrator listened to staff's report as

6 well as public testimony in favor of, and in opposition to, the Project and the proposed section

7 15183 exemption. After the close of the public hearing, the Zoning Administrator determined that

8 the evidence showed the Project was entitled to the proposed section 15183 exemption. Specifically,

9 the Zoning Administrator, based on the evidence provided by staff, found that the Project would

10 have no peculiar significant impacts, nor any significant offsite or cumulative impacts, except for

11 the loss of certain habitat due to grading activities. These impacts, however, could be mitigated

12 pursuant to the County's standard mitigation policies, as set forth in Mitigation Measures Bio-1.5

13 and Bio-1.6, both of which were adopted as part of the certified EIR for the 2011 GPU. Based on

14 these data and findings, the Zoning Administrator granted the exemption but recommended that the

15 Planning Director, who is charged with approving the Project's Site Plan and imposing Conditions

16 of Approval, direct Petitioners to enclose the debris processing area.

17 37. In the months between the Zoning Administrator hearing and the Planning Director's

18 decision on the Site Plan, Petitioners agreed to enclose the debris processing area as recommended

19 by staff and the Zoning Administrator. This information was then forwarded to the Planning

20 Director, who, on November 2, 2020, approved NCER's Site Plan and issued more than 60

21 Conditions of Approval. Among these conditions are the following:

22 Condition 25, which requires that all processing of materials be conducted entirely

23 within enclosed buildings, and that total building floor area on the site shall not

24 exceed 45,000 square feet.

25 Condition 54b, which provides that "operational activities related to crushing and

26 grinding of material on site will not exceed 4,000 tons of material processed

27 annually, or a maximum of 20 tons per day."

28

10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Condition 61, which limits the Project to two (2) outbound haul truck trips per day
N (average).
00 7 40 a Condition 62, which provides that "no more than two (2) pieces of heavy equipment
shall be in operation during any one-hour period."
Condition 51, which requires all trucks entering and leaving the facility to follow the
"Truck Haul Route" established by the Planning Director. This haul route was

7 specifically designed to keep trucks away from residences.

8 38. Following the Planning Director's approval of the NCER Site Plan and issuance of

9 the Project Conditions, four entities appealed to the Planning Commission and requested that the

10 decisions of the Zoning Administrator and the Planning Director be overturned. The four appellants

11 were: (1) the City of Escondido, (2) the Montreux Homeowners Association, (3) the Twin Oaks

12 Valley Community Sponsor Group, and (4) the Hidden Meadows Community Sponsor Group.

13 39. Petitioners and County staff responded to each claim raised in the four appeals,
14 demonstrating that none of them presented substantial evidence showing that the Project could

15 result in peculiar and significant impact that could not be mitigated through application of the

16 County's standard policies and measures (i.e., the criteria for a section 15183 exemption).

17 40. On February 5, 2021, the Planning Commission held a public hearing to consider the

18 four appeals. In its report to the Commission, County staff explained why the Project qualified for

19 the section 15183 exemption and addressed the claims made by the appellants. Staff then

20 recommended that the Planning Commission deny the appeals and uphold the decisions of the

21 Zoning Administrator and the Planning Director.

22 41. Petitioners made a presentation in support of the Project and in defense of the Zoning

23 Administrator's decision to apply the section 15183 decision.

24 42. Members of the public, including three of the four appellants, also testified at the

25 Planning Commission hearing.

26 43. After the close of public testimony, one member of the Planning Commission asked

27 if Petitioners would be willing to move NCER's daily start time from 5 a.m. to 7 a.m. as a gesture

28

11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 of goodwill to the neighboring property owners. Though there was no legal requirement for such a

2 change, Petitioners agreed to the 7 a.m. start time as an additional condition on the Project.

3 44. The Planning Commission then voted unanimously to deny all four appeals and
4 uphold the decisions of the Zoning Administrator and Planning Director.

5 45. Following the Planning Commission's decision, the four appellants submitted a new

6 round of appeals to the Board of Supervisors, again asking that the decision of the Zoning

7 Administrator be overturned. More specifically, the appeals requested that the Board of Supervisors
overrule County staff, the Zoning Administrator, and the Planning Commission, and deny the

0 section 15183 exemption for the Project.

10 46. Prior to the Board hearing on the appeals, Petitioners and County staff prepared

11 detailed responses to each claim raised by the four appellants. The County staff report reiterated its

12 earlier findings that, based on the technical reports and other data developed during the eight years

13 the Project was under review, there was no substantial evidence showing that the Project had the

14 potential to cause a peculiar and significant effect that could not be mitigated through the County's

15 uniform standards and measures. Staff also indicated that nothing in the materials submitted by
16 appellants disturbed this fundamental finding, and that the Project therefore qualified for the section

17 15183 exemption. Petitioners' materials, which were also submitted to the Board of Supervisors,
18 provided additional evidence in support of the exemption determination made by the Zoning

19 Administrator.

20 47. On May 5, 2021, the Board of Supervisors held a public hearing to consider the four

21 appeals. County staff made a presentation to the Board, explaining that the Project was entitled to

22 the section 15183 exemption and that none of the claims or evidence submitted by the appellants

23 was sufficient to disqualify the Project from that exemption. Petitioners made a similar presentation

24 that also showed how the Project advanced the solid waste diversion goals of the County. Members

25 of the public, including the appellants, also testified before the Board.

26 48. After the public testimony was concluded, the Board of Supervisors did not identify

27 any specific project-related impact it felt was peculiar and significant. Nor did the Board of
28 Supervisors asked County staff for additional information on any particular impact that might

12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

disqualify the Project from the section 15183 exemption. Nor did the Board ask whether the impacts

2 of concern to the appellants could be mitigated through application of the County's standard

3 policies and measures. Instead, without substantive discussion or inquiry, the Board of Supervisors
simply voted unanimously to grant the four appeals, overturn the decision of the Zoning

5 Administrator, deny the section 15183 exemption, and order County staff and Petitioners to prepare

6 an EIR for the Project.

7 49. According to the Minute Order from the May 5, 2021 hearing, the Board of

8 Supervisors found that "the Project will result in project-specific peculiar impacts that were not
9 analyzed as significant impacts in the General Plan EIR related to air quality, traffic, noise, and

10 greenhouse gas emissions." The Minute Order failed to acknowledge that, pursuant to section

11 15183, County staff had already studied NCER's project-specific impacts on air quality, traffic,

12 noise, and greenhouse gas emissions, and found that these impacts were neither peculiar nor

13 significant, as those terms are used in CEQA.

14 50. In the Minute Order from the May 5, 2021, County staff made statements indicating
15 that the Project Site's industrial zoning made the Project "peculiar", leading to potentially

16 significant impacts on traffic, air quality, aesthetics, noise, dust, and odor, and climate. Staff

17 identified no substantial evidence is support of these assertions. In fact, the voluminous staff reports

18 prepared for the Zoning Administrator, Planning Commission, and Board of Supervisor hearings

19 never made such assertions. On the contrary, all such staff reports demonstrated, using evidence
20 from the many technical studies prepared for the Project, that NCER would not create any such

21 peculiar significant impacts, and that nearby property owners would not experience significant

22 traffic, noise, air quality, dust, aesthetic, or climate-related impacts. Thus, the statement from

23 County staff, which was inserted into the May 5, 2021 Minute Order without discussion or

24 explanation, is inconsistent with each technical determination made by staff during all prior public

25 hearings.

26 51. Because the Board of Supervisors failed to apply the section 15183 exemption to the

27 NCER project, as required by the mandatory language of Public Resources Code section 21083.3(b)

28 and CEQA Guidelines section 15183 itself, the County and the Board violated CEQA and

13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion. For this reason, Petitioners timely filed the current

2 action seeking a writ of mandate.

8 53. As a land use agency in California, the County and its Board of Supervisors must

9 comply with CEQA's procedural and substantive provisions, including those that exempt some

10 projects from all or portions of the environmental review process. Among these are Public

11 Resources Code sections 21083.3(b) and (d).

12 54. Public Resources Code section 21083.3(b) provides that

13 If a development project is consistent with the general plan of a

14 local agency and an environmental impact report was certified with

15 respect to that general plan, the application of this division to the

16 approval of that development project shall be limited to effects on

17 the environment which are peculiar to the parcel or to the project

18 and which were not addressed as significant effects in the prior

19 environmental impact report, or which substantial new information
20 shows will be more significant than described in the prior

21 environmental impact report. (Emphasis added.)

22 55. Public Resources Code section 21083.3(d) provides that

23 An effect of a project upon the environment shall not be

24 considered peculiar to the parcel or project, for purposes of this
25 section, if uniformly applied development policies or standards

26 have been previously adopted by the city or county, with a finding
27 based on substantial evidence, which need not include an

28 environmental impact report, that the development policies and

14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 standards will substantially mitigate that environmental effect

2 when applied to future projects, unless substantial new information

3 shows that the policies or standards will substantially mitigate the

4 environmental effect.

5 56. Respondents County and Board of Supervisors likewise must comply with the

6 CEQA Guidelines, which include provisions that exempt certain qualifying projects from all or

7 portions of the environmental review process. Among these is Guidelines section 15183.

8 57. Section 15183(a) provides that:

9 CEQA mandates that projects which are consistent with the

10 development density established by existing zoning, community

11 plan, or general plan policies for which an EIR was certified shall

12 not require additional environmental review, except as might be
13 necessary to examine whether there are project-specific significant

14 effects which are peculiar to the project or its site. This streamlines
15 the review of such projects and reduces the need to prepare

16 repetitive environmental studies. (Emphasis added.)

17 58. Section 15183(f) provides in relevant part that:

18 An effect of a project on the environment shall not be considered

19 peculiar to the project or the parcel for the purposes of this section
20 if uniformly applied development policies or standards have been

21 previously adopted by the city or county with a finding that the

22 development policies or standards will substantially mitigate that

23 environmental effect when applied to future projects, unless

24 substantial new information shows that the policies or standards

25 will not substantially mitigate the environmental effect. (Emphasis

26 added.)

27 59. In 2011, as part of its General Plan Update (GPU), the County designated the Project

28 site as Heavy Industrial (1-3) and rezoned it from Rural Residential (RR) to General Industrial

15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 (M54). The 2011 GPU was adopted pursuant to a certified Final Environmental Impact Report

2 (EIR) that was never challenged in any judicial proceeding.

3 60. Under County Zoning Ordinance section 6975, light recycling processing plants are
4 expressly permitted on properties zoned M54.

5 61. The NCER project meets the criteria for a light recycling processing plant, as set

6 forth in County Zoning Ordinance section 6975.

7 62. Because it complies with the Site's existing land use and zoning designations, and

8 because it is consistent with County Zoning Ordinance section 6975, the NCER project does not

9 require a general plan amendment, zone change, or use permit. These same factors make the Project
10 facially eligible for CEQA exemption under CEQA Guidelines section 15183.

11 63. To ensure that Project would not result in any peculiar and significant impact,

12 County staff subjected the Project to extensive environmental review involving eight years of

13 analysis and more than a dozen technical studies ranging from aesthetics and air quality to

14 greenhouse gas emissions and traffic. Invoices from the County show that County staff experts in

15 virtually every environmental discipline examined the Project. These same invoices indicate that

16 Petitioners paid the County more than $300,000 to have these staff experts conduct their work.

17 64. Based on its intensive review of the Project, County staff issued a report dated June

18 23, 2020 stating that the Project would not result in any peculiar and significant effect, except for

19 grading-related impacts to various vegetation types. Staff determined that these biological impacts

20 could be substantially mitigated through the County's standard mitigation measures (i.e., Bio-1.5

21 and Bio-1.6), which were adopted as part of the 2011 GPU EIR. Based on this assessment, staff

22 recommended that the Zoning Administrator apply the section 15183 exemption to the NCER

23 Project. The Zoning Administrator, at a properly noticed public hearing, followed staff's
24 recommendation and applied the exemption.

25 65. The Planning Director, when reviewing the Project's proposed Site Plan, also

26 reviewed the technical data developed by staff regarding project-related impacts. Based on this

27 review, the Planning Director approved the Site Plan but imposed more than 60 conditions on the

28 Project to ensure it would not result in significant impacts on environment. These conditions not

16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 only addressed mitigation for the Project's biological impacts, they also limited the number of

2 outbound haul truck trips per day, restricted how many pieces of recycling and processing

3 equipment could operate during any one-hour period, limited overall product "throughput" at the

4 facility, established a mandatory "truck haul route", and required that all processing and recycling

5 activities take place in enclosed buildings.

6 66. The Planning Commission, when it denied the appeals and affirmed the decisions of

7 the Zoning Administrator and Planning Director, also required that NCER's daily start time be

8 moved from 5 a.m. to 7 a.m.

9 67. At the Zoning Administrator hearing and at the appeal hearing held by the Planning

10 Commission and the Board of Supervisors, County staff stated that the Project would not result in

11 any peculiar or significant impact that could not be adequately mitigated by the County's standard

12 policies and measures. These statements by staff were supported by substantial evidence in the

13 record, including but not limited to the technical studies that had been prepared for the Project.

14 68. During the Zoning Administrator hearing, no one presented substantial evidence that

15 the Project could lead to peculiar and significant impacts that could not be substantially mitigated

16 through application of the County's standard mitigation policies and measures. Nor did anyone

17 present substantial evidence showing that the Project had the potential to cause significant offsite or
18 cumulative impacts.

19 69. During the appeals to the Planning Commission, none of the four appellants, or any

20 other person or entity, presented substantial evidence that the Project could lead to peculiar and

21 significant impacts that could not be substantially mitigated through application of the County's

22 standard mitigation policies and measures. Nor did anyone present substantial evidence showing

23 that the Project had the potential to cause significant offsite or cumulative impacts.

24 70. During the appeals to the Board of Supervisors, none of the four appellants, or any

25 other person or entity, presented substantial evidence that the Project could lead to peculiar and

26 significant impacts that could not be substantially mitigated through application of the County's
27 standard mitigation policies and measures. Nor did anyone present substantial evidence showing

28 that the Project had the potential to cause significant offsite or cumulative impacts.

17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

71. During the Board of Supervisors hearing on the appeals, neither County staff nor any
2 member of the Board presented substantial evidence that the Project could lead to peculiar and
significant impacts that could not be substantially mitigated through application of the County's

4 standard mitigation policies and measures. Nor did staff or members of the Board present
substantial evidence showing that the Project had the potential to cause significant offsite or

6 cumulative impacts.

72. Based on the extensive technical evidence developed through the County's 8-year

8 environmental review process, the NCER project qualifies for a CEQA exemption under Section

9 15183.

10 73. Despite the evidence describe above, the Board of Supervisors refused to apply the

11 section 15183 exemption to NCER as required by CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. Instead, the

12 Board directed staff to prepare an EIR for the Project. The Board's decision was not based on

13 substantial evidence in the record. Further, the Board, in making this decision, failed to proceed in

14 the manner required by law. Thus, the Board's action was arbitrary and capricious and constituted a

15 prejudicial abuse of discretion that can only be corrected by a writ of mandate from this court.

16 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

17 Violations of the California Planning and Zoning Law (Govt. Code g§ 65000, et seq)

18 Against All Respondents

19 74. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by this reference allegations through 73, above,

20 as if fully set forth herein.

21 75. As the land use authority with jurisdiction over the Project site, the County and the

22 Board of Supervisors must comply with the California Planning and Zoning Law. (Govt.Code §§

23 65000, et seq.) The California Planning and Zoning Law prohibits a city or county from changing

24 the land use or zoning designation of a particular parcel except through the precise procedures set

25 forth in the statute. Further, a city or county may not circumvent these procedures by simply

26 refusing to approve projects that comply with the property's land use and zoning designation. In

27 other words, the Planning and Zoning Law does not allow a city or county to implement a de facto

28

18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 general plan amendment or zone change by denying compliant projects and suggesting that the

2 applicant return with a different proposal.

3 76. The NCER project is consistent with the industrial land use and zoning designations

4 that have applied to the Project site since 2011. The current Board of Supervisors, through their

5 actions on May 5, 2021, indicated that it did not favor industrial uses at the Project site, despite the

6 site's land use and zoning designations. By denying the section 15183 exemption to which the

7 Project is entitled, the Board of Supervisors signaled that it would obstruct this and all other

8 industrial projects proposed for the Site. In taking this position, the Board effectively "redesignated"

9 and "rezoned" the Site as "non-industrial". Such an action is prohibited under the Planning and

10 Zoning Law.

11 77. In effectuating a de facto general plan amendment and zone change for the NCER

12 site, the Board of Supervisors violated the Planning and Zoning Law, thereby committing a

13 prejudicial abuse of discretion that can only be rectified by a writ of mandate from this court.

14 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

15 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:

16 1. Alternate and peremptory writs of mandate directing the County Board of

17 Supervisors to affirm the decision of the Zoning Administrator, issued on June 25, 2020, applying

18 the CEQA Guidelines section 15183 exemption to the NCER project;

19 2. Alternate and peremptory writs of mandate directing the County Board of

20 Supervisors to vacate and set aside its decision, taken on May 5, 2021, granting the appeals of the

21 Project opponents and requiring an Environmental Impact Report for the NCER project;

22 3. Alternate and peremptory writs of mandate directing the County and its Board of

23 Supervisors to comply with the requirements of CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and the California

24 Planning and Zoning Law;

25 4. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent

26 injunction restraining the County and its Board of Supervisors and their agents, servants, and

27 employees, and all others acting in concert with them or on their behalf, from taking any action to

28 implement the action/decision taken by the Board on May 5, 2021 relative to the NCER project,

19
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 pending full compliance with the requirements of CEQA, the Planning and Zoning Law, and all

2 other applicable laws;

6. An order awarding Petitioners their attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure

5 section 1021.5 and any other applicable authority; and

6 7. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
