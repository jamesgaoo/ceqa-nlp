15 BEACH CITY COUNCIL; DOES 1 to 10, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
inclusive,

16 Respondents and defendants, Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1085, 1094.5, & 1021.5; Pub. Res. Code § 30000, et seq.

18 Real Parties in Interest

19 Petitioner and plaintiff PROTECT SHELL BEACH hereby alleges as follows:
20 INTRODUCTION

21 1. Through this action, PROTECT SHELL BEACH challenges the City of
22 Pismo Beach's unlawful approval of a Coastal Development Permit for the
23 construction of an Accessory Dwelling Unit in the community of Shell Beach (the
24 "Project"). As set forth herein, the City's approval of the permit must be set aside
25 because the Project does not conform to the development regulation set forth in the

26 City's Local Coastal Plan.

27

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 1-

1 THE PARTIES

2 2. Petitioner and plaintiff PROTECT SHELL BEACH ("PSB" or
3 | "Petitioner") is an unincorporated association concerned with the environmental

4 and coastal impacts of development in and around the City of Pismo Beach. Their

5 members include property owners and residents of the City of Pismo as well as

6 neighbors of the Project site.

7 3. Respondent and defendant CITY OF PISMO BEACH ("City") is a local

8 government agency-significant portions of which fall within the Coastal Zone-
with the authority to regulate and administer land use and development within the
9 City of Pismo Beach, California, but only in compliance with the duly adopted
10

X0q09; Naficy provisions of its zoning ordinances, General Plan, Community Plans, Municipal
11 Code, and all applicable provisions of state law, including CEQA, the Planning and
12 Zoning law, the Subdivision Map Act, and the California Coastal Act.

13 4. Respondent and defendant PISMO BEACH CITY COUNCIL ("City

"5 14 Council") is the legislative body and highest administrative body in the City. The
BOyJO MOT 15 City Council has the authority to approve or disapprove proposed development

16 applications and other land use entitlements.
5.
17 Petitioner does not know the identity of DOES 1 to 10 1 but will amend
the Petition as required to specifically identify each such
18 person or entity as a
respondent and defendant if the identity, interest, and capacity of such party, if
19 any, becomes known.
20 6. The Project's approved Administrative Permit identifies Maria
21 Loveless as the Project applicant and Jack Loveless and Maria Loveless as owners

22 of the real property that constitutes the Project site. Accordingly, Petitioner is

23 informed and believes and, on that basis, alleges that Jack Loveless and Maria

24 Loveless are real parties in interest.

25 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

26 7. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to California

27 Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5 and Public Resources Code
sections 30802, 30803, and 30804. This Court has the authority to issue a writ of

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 2-

1 mandate directing Respondents to vacate and set aside their approval of the Project|

2 under the Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5. This Court also has

3 authority to award attorney's fees and costs under Code of Civil Procedure section

4 1021.5 where, as here, Petitioner seeks to enforce important rights affecting the

5 public interest.

8.
6 Venue for this action properly lies in the San Luis Obispo County

7 Superior Court because Respondents are located in San Luis Obispo County and
because the action concerns the approval of a development Project on real property
8 located in San Luis Obispo County.
9 PROCEDURAL ALLEGATIONS

10 9.
Xoq0g Naficy Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the
11 instant action and has exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the extent

12 required by law, by inter alia, submitting extensive written comments opposing the
13 Project to the City's administrative and planning staff. Because the Project was

o 14 approved by City planning staff without a public hearing, there was no opportunity
SOYJO MDT 15 for Petitioner to appear. Petitioner's members therefore qualify as "aggrieved

16 persons" under Public Resources Code section 30801.
10.
17 Petitioner has requested that the City not approve this Administrative
Coastal Development Permit ("CDP") as proposed and presented detailed factual
18 and legal arguments supporting its position, yet the City proceeded to approve the
19 Project without any adequate response to Petitioners' arguments. Therefore, any
20 further attempts to pursue administrative remedies would be futile.

21 11. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources

22 Code section 30802 by filing notice of this action with the California Coastal

23 Il Commission.

24 12. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Code of Civil

25 Procedure section 388 by mailing a copy of the Petition and Complaint to the

26 Attorney General of the State of California.
13.
27 Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary
course of law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 3-

1 Respondents to comply with their duties and set aside the City's unlawful approval

2 of the Project's Administrative Coastal Development Permit. In the absence of such

3 remedies, Respondents' approval will remain in effect in violation of the Coastal Act

4 and other California laws.

14. 5 If Respondents are not enjoined from approving the Project and

6 undertaking and/or permitting acts in furtherance thereof, Petitioner and its
members will suffer irreparable harm from which there is no adequate remedy at
7 law.

8 15. In pursuing this action. which involves enforcement of important
9 rights affecting the public interest, Petitioner will confer a substantial benefit on
10 the general public, including citizens of San Luis Obispo County and the State of
Naficy XD908 J0 e9yJO M0] 11 California, and therefore will be entitled to attorney's fees and costs pursuant to,
12 inter alia, Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

13 16. Petitioners bring this action in part pursuant to Public Resources Code

14 sections 30802, 30803, and 30804, Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, and/or Code

15 of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, which require that an agency's approval of a
project be set aside if the agency has prejudicially abused its discretion. Prejudicial
16 abuse of discretion occurs either where an agency has failed to proceed in a manner a
17 required by law or where its determination or decision is not supported by
18 substantial evidence. Respondents have prejudicially abused their discretion

19 because the City failed to proceed in the manner required by law and/or the City's

20 findings and factual conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence.

21 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

22 17. Jack and Maria Loveless (the "Applicants") own the real property

23 identified as Assessor's Parcel Number ("APN") 010-343-014 at 290 Palisade

24 Avenue in the Shell Beach area of Pismo Beach (the "Property"). The Property is a

25 4,000-square-foot lot with an existing 1,072-square-foot single-family residence. The

26 Property is located within the coastal zone as defined by the California Coastal Act.
Pub. Res. Code § 30103. However, the Property does not fall within the City's
27

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 4.

1 designated Coastal Appeal Zone overlay, which is defined by Pismo Beach

2 Municipal Code ("PBMC") section 17.006.0270 as:

3 The area between the sea and the first public road paralleling the
sea or within three hundred feet of the inland extent of any beach
4 or of the mean high tide line where there is no beach, whichever
is the greater distance. Also, any land located on tidelands, 5 submerged lands, public trust lands, or within one hundred feet
6 of any wetland, estuary, stream, or within three hundred feet of the top of the seaward face of any coastal bluff.
7 18. On April 24, 2020, the Applicants submitted a planning application to
8 the City's Community Development Department to construct a one-bedroom 495-
9 square-foot ADU over an existing approximately 400-square-foot garage (the
10 "Project"). A June 4, 2020, letter from the City to Applicants identified issues with

garage Naficy XOGDE . 11 (1) a nonconforming 3-foot rear setback, (2) a new support post inside the

12 that would further reduce the nonconforming (due to size) parking space, (3) utility

13 easements, and (4) required onsite parking. In particular, the City referenced an
April 21, 2020, memorandum from the director of the California Coastal
5 14

eOUJO MDT Commission to explain that new state laws regarding ADU approvals, discussed in
15 more detail infra, did not supersede the provisions of the Coastal Act or a certified a
16 LCP, also discussed infra, as to parking, especially when a lack or reduction in
17 parking would impact coastal access resources like street parking.
18 19. Revised plans were submitted to the City on July 1, 2020. Notice of

19 Intent to Approve the ADU application was mailed to neighboring property owners
20 on July 14, 2020. City staff approved the plans as submitted and issued

21 Administrative Coastal Development Permit ("ACDP"): Project No. P20-000027 on

22 July 27, 2020.

20. On July 30, 2020, Applicants sought a permit to demolish the existing 23
garage roof and slab. Construction Permit No: B20-000237 was issued on August 24 11, 2020. Around the same time, the applicants--allegedly for the first time-
25 discovered extensive termite damage in the existing garage. In an August 27, 2020,
26 email, the City's community development director Matthew Downing advised
27 Applicants' representatives that if they tore down and rebuilt the garage it would be

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 5-

1 required to comply with current zoning requirements including setbacks. However,

2 director Downing also claimed that if the ADU or a portion thereof were located

3 within the nonconforming structure, no setback would be required pursuant to

4 Government Code section 65852.2, subdivision (a)(1)(D)(vii). He invited Applicants

5 to propose an amendment to their original design incorporating the ADU in the

6 garage and promised a 60-day review.
21. Applicants submitted an application for revision on August 31, 2020.
7 Construction Permit No: R20-000011 was issued on September 1, 2020.
8 22. Applicants submitted their revised plans on September 29, 2020, for a
9 substantially larger ADU on the footprint of the now-demolished garage. Following
10 increasing public opposition to the Project in general and especially to the revisions,
M0qD9 Naficy 11 the City appears to have wrestled with whether the ADU as now proposed would

12 require approval from the Planning Commission. Director Downing, in an October

13 15, 2020, email to city manager Jameg Lewis, posited that the revised plans would

14 likely need to go before the Planning Commission unless Applicants made further
5
8OY0 M0T 15 revisions. On October 16, 2020, manager Lewis emailed the Pismo Beach City
Council stating that City staff would consult with their attorney and the state
16 department of Housing and Community Development ("HCD") regarding whether
17 the revised plans could still be approved administratively as an ADU.
18 23. In an October 20, 2020, letter to Applicants, director Downing
19 explained that the new plans appeared to be inconsistent with the previously issued
20 ACDP P20-000027 because the changes exceeded what was anticipated or

21 authorized under the approved land use entitlement. In particular, director

22 Downing highlighted (1) significant floor plan changes, (2) elimination of the two-

23 car garage previously used by the main residence, (3) changes to the ADU parking,

24 (4) incorporation and addition of storage areas in the front and back of the former
garage, and (5) the creation of a third downstairs bedroom that could be locked off
25 from the rest of the ADU as an additional dwelling unit.
26 24. On November 25, 2020, Applicant submitted a new planning
27 application, this time to construct a detached ADU. The accompanying plans, dated

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 6-

1 November 4, 2020, show a 1,136-square-foot, two-story, three-bedroom ADU in and

2 around the footprint of the previously demolished nonconforming garage. No onsite

3 parking was provided in the plans, either for the existing residence or the ADU.

4 25. In addition to a third bedroom and 3/4 bathroom, the first floor of the

5 newly proposed ADU also provided two storage areas, one to be shared with laundry

6 facilities. The second floor contained two bedrooms, a living room, a kitchen, a 1/2
bathroom and another 3/4 bathroom. A second story deck wrapped around two sides
7 of the ADU, extending over the driveway in one direction and towards the existing
8 residence in another direction.

9 26. In December 2020, director Downing communicated with Coastal
10 Commission staff regarding coastal zone ADU approvals in light of the new state
MOqD8 Naficy 11 laws. Commission attorney Misha Tsukerman emailed director Downing a link to

12 an April 21, 2020, Coastal Commission guidance memol "to help local governments

13 understand how to carry out their Coastal Act obligations while also implementing
state requirements regarding [ADUs]." That memo and its recommendations for
6 14

80yJ0 MDT 15 agencies with previously certified ADU regulations in their LCPs are discussed in
more detail below.
16 27. On January 20, 2021, the City distributed a Notice of Intent to
17 Approve the new application as of February 3, 2021. However, a January 29, 2021,
18 letter to Applicants from City attorney David M. Fleishman informed them that the
19 City intended to consider the Project at the March 9, 2021, Planning Commission
20 meeting because the new proposal was not consistent with PBMC section 17.117

21 (ADU approval), at least as to the parking requirement. Attorney Fleishman's letter

22 indicated that Applicants could avoid the need for Planning Commission review by

23 reducing their proposed ADU's "size and scope in some manner."

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 7-

1 28. By February 23, 2021, Applicants had not yet signed the indemnity

2 agreement presented by the City as a condition precedent to approval of the Project,

3 so consideration of the Project was removed from the March 9, 2021, Planning

4 Commission agenda.

29. In March 2021, Applicants began discussing possible revisions to the

6 Project to keep it within the confines of administrative approval under the City's
ADU ordinance (PBMC § 17.117.010, et seq). Revised plans were submitted in April
7 2021, showing removal of the first-floor bedroom and bathroom and reintroduction
8 of four parking spaces: three spaces inside the reconstructed garage (two tandem
9 and one individual) and one space outside the garage under the ADU's second story

10 deck. The plans indicated that each parking space would be 9 by 18 feet. As more
X0908 Naficy 11 fully set forth below (and in comment letters to the City prior to its approval of the
12 ACDP) the garage as proposed is not adequate to accommodate three vehicles at the

13 same time. This shows that while the applicant pays lip service to meeting the
LCP's parking requirements, the Project does not seriously attempt to accommodate
6 14

eJyJ0 MDT 15 the ADU's parking demand in the garage, as required by the City's LCP.
30. As proposed, the Project includes the same number of windows in the
16
garage that were included in the earlier design for the lower-level bedroom and
17 bathroom. This fact plainly suggests that the applicant intends to retain the option
18 of converting or using the garage space as living quarters because ordinarily, no one
19 would install this many windows in a garage or storage space unless they had plans

20 to use the garage for living space. This conclusion is buttressed by the fact that the
21 plans show several other installations which support residential use of the first-

22 floor space including dropped ceilings, insulated walls, sink, electrical (unneeded

23 receptacles and switches), gas, shower, fireplace, smoke detector, and T Stat.
31.
24 The City reviewed the new plans on May 6, 2021 and again on June 1,
2021. A final review was conducted on July 30, 2021.
25
32. On August 18, 2021, the City issued a Notice of Intent to Approve the
26 Project via administrative action on August 31, 2021.
27

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 8-

33. A spate of public comments opposing the Project highlighted

2 inconsistency with the City's LCP, lack of adequate parking due to the non-
3 conforming and impractical size of the provided parking spaces; nonconforming

4 setbacks that were, in places, as 3 little as 3 feet from the property line; and that
allowing Applicants to rely on the footprint of their demolished garage to

6 "grandfather" a nonconforming Project violated the law and would harm the
character of the surrounding neighborhood.
7 34. ACDP Project No. P20-000076 was issued by the City on August 31,
2021. The ACDP authorized Applicants to construct a 525 square-foot two-bedroom

9 ADU over an expanded reconstruction of the demolished garage. None of the first-

10 floor garage area, either space designated for parking or left empty, nor the 70
X0qD9 Naficy 11 square foot staircase area are included in the calculation of the ADU square footage.

12 35. As explained below, the 2018 ADU regulations that were in force for

13 the majority of the period during which the City considered the project were

14 replaced in August 2021 when the Coastal Commission certified the City's revised
6
e3!J0 MDT 15 ADU regulations. However, the City chose to approve the Project under the 2018
regulations since that is what was applied during the review process. As such, the
16 August 31, 2021, permit purports to rely on Government Code section 65852.2,
17 subdivision (a)(1) to excuse several non-conforming aspects of the Project, including
18 minimum lot area, rear and street side setbacks, and the size of parking spaces for
19 the primary residence.

20 36. The City reissued the ACDP on October 19, 2021, with a slight change

21 to the wording of Condition of Approval number 11. Where the original August 31,

22 2021, ACDP stated that "[u]nderground electric service conductors are required for

23 the new electric service at the ADU," the revised condition reads "[u]nderground

24 electric service conduit is required from the property line to electrical panel for
future underground service at the Accessory Dwelling Unit."
25 37. As pointed out in Petitioner's August 27, 2021, comments to the City, the
26 problems and inconsistencies in the Project plans that the City made publicly
27 available precluded a thorough and meaningful public review. These same

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 9-

problems undermine the validity of the final ACDP because the drawings do not
2 make clear exactly what the City approved. The problem stems from the fact that

3 the measurements provided in the plans do not match the project description
4 provided by the City and are internally inconsistent. The Notice stated the Project

5 consists of a 561 square foot ADU and did not mention the new garage. The ACDP

6 however states the ADU is 525 square feet. It appears that the second story ADU
may be as large as 778 square feet and that the first floor adds an additional 335
7 sqquare feet. to the property beyond the garage space. It is unclear whether this
8 lower addition is part of the new ADU, or whether it is intended to replace the
9 laundry space that was included in the demolished garage.
10 City of Pismo Beach ADU Regulations
MOqDg Naficy 11 38. In September 2016, California Senate Bill 1069 and Assembly Bills
12 2299 and 2406 introduced significant changes to the way in which local agencies are

13 allowed to regulate second units, or "accessory dwelling units," in single and multi-
family residential zones. In response to the new state mandates, the City of Pismo
5 14

eOUJO MDT 15 Beach developed its own ADU regulation in 2018.
39. Ordinance No. 0-2018-010 (the "2018 Ordinance") was adopted by the
16 City on August 21, 2018. In pertinent part, the 2018 Ordinance defined "Accessory
17 Dwelling Unit" as "[a]n attached or detached dwelling unit which provides complete
18 independent living facilities for one or more persons. It shall include permanent
19 provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking, and sanitation on the same parcel as
20 the primary unit." PBMC § 17.006.0017. More importantly, the 2018 Ordinance
21 revised PBMC Chapter 17.117 in light of the new state laws regarding ADU

22 permitting and approval.

23 40. As explained below, because Title 17 of the PBMC implements the

24 City's LCP (PBMC § 17.01.040), amendments to that section must generally be
certified by the California Coastal Commission before they can take effect. The
25 Coastal Commission certified the City's ADU amendment on November 8, 2018.
26 41. In October 2019, California Assembly Bill 68 enacted further changes
27 in Government Code section 65852.2 (authorization for local agency to regulate

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 10-

1 ADU approval), including (1) requiring that agencies remove any limitation based

2 on lot size, (2) shortening ministerial approval from 120 days to 60 days, and (3)

3 removing any limitations that would not permit an ADU to be at least 800 square

4 feet with four-foot rear and side setbacks. Assembly Bill 881 and Senate Bill 13,

5 also concerning amendments to Government Code section 65852.2 were passed at
the same time. The substantive changes embodied in the new laws went into effect 6
January 1, 2020.
7 42. The City updated its ADU regulations in Ordinance No. 0-2020-006,
8 adopted on October 20, 2020. Ordinance No. 0-2021-001, adopted by the City on
9 April 8, 2021, repealed Ordinance No. 0-2020-006 and enacted the current version
10 of PBMC Chapter 17.117. The amendment was certified by the Coastal Commission
HDQOS Naficy 11 on August 12, 2021.

12 CALIFORNIA COASTAL ACT

13 43. The California Coastal Act of 1976 (Pub. Res. Code § 30000, et seq,

'ö 14 | "Coastal Act") was enacted to permanently protect the state's natural and scenic
90 0 M0T 15 coastal resources and prevent the deterioration and destruction of the ecological

16 balance within the coastal zone. Pub. Res. Code § 30001. The basic goals of the

17 Coastal Act include "[a]ssur[ing] orderly and balanced utilization and conservation
of coastal zone resources," "[m]aximiz[ing] public access . and recreational
18 opportunities in the coastal zone," and encouraging "coordinated planning and
19 development ... in the coastal zone." Pub. Res. Code $ 30001.5.
20 44. The Coastal Act directs that "[a]ll public agencies and all federal 688 agencies, to the extent possible under federal law or regulations or the United
States Constitution, shall comply with the provisions of this division." Pub. Res.
Code § 30003.

45. The California Coastal Commission, a 15-member body that succeeded
25 the various state and regional coastal zone conservation commissions (Pub. Res.

26 Code § 30331) is primarily responsible for implementing the provisions of the
Coastal Act and "is designated as the state coastal zone planning and management
27 agency for any and all purposes." Pub. Res. Code § 30330.

13 § 30330, Marine Forests Society v. Cal. Coastal Commission (2005) 36 Cal. 4th 1,

'5 14 20), each local government lying in whole or in part within the coastal zone is

eOyJO MDT 15 required to prepare a local coastal program ("LCP") for the portion of the coastal

16 zone within its own jurisdiction?. Pub. Res. Code § 30500. The content of the LCP is

17 determined by the local government in full consultation with the commission and

18 with full public participation. Pub. Res. Code § 30500.1. The LCP must comply with

19 the minimum standards set forth in the Coastal Act. Yost v. Thomas (1984) 36
Cal.3d 561.

20 48. The LCP "js composed of two parts: a land use plan (LUP), which

22 implementation plan, which includes the zoning, zoning maps, and other

23 implementing actions for the coastal zone." Security Nat. Guar. Inc. v. California

government must also submit zoning or other ordinances and zoning district maps

9 zoning proposals within 60 days.

10 50. Any person undertaking any development within the coastal zone must
yoqD9 Naficy a 11 obtain a coastal development permit ("CDP"). Pub. Res. Code 30600, subd. (a).
12 Development is broadly defined to include construction of any structure, discharge

13 of any waste material, grading or other land manipulations, and a change in the a
density or intensity of use of land, including but not limited to subdivisions. Pub.
õ 14

BOUy0 MDT 15 Res. Code 30106. For coastal areas that are not covered by a certified LCP,
applications for CDPs are made directly to the Coastal Commission. Pub. Res. Code
16 § 30519, subd. (a). After an LCP is certified, the local government assumes the
17 responsibility for issuing CDPs. Ibid.
18 51. In Charles A. Pratt Const. Co., Inc. v. California Coastal Com'n (2008)

19 162 Cal.App.4th 1068 ("Pratt Construction"), the Second Appellate District
20 concluded that although, following the final certification by the Coastal

21 Commission, the LCP is incorporated into the local government's general plan and

22 is implemented by the local entity, it cannot be considered "local regulation.* Pratt

23 Construction explained that "[u]nder the Coastal Act's legislative scheme . . . the

24 LCP and the development permits issued by local agencies pursuant to the Coastal
Act are not solely a matter of local law, but embody state policy." Id., at 1075. "In
25 fact, a fundamental purpose of the Coastal Act is to ensure that state policies
26 prevail over the concerns of local government." Ibid.

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 13-

1 52. Likewise, the Coastal Act takes precedence over many aspects of the
2 state's new ADU laws. Government Code Section 65852.2, which permits local

3 agencies to provide by ordinance "for the creation of accessory dwelling units in

4 areas zoned to allow single-family or multifamily dwelling residential use" also

5 provides that:

6 Nothing in this section shall be construed to supersede or in any way alter or lessen the effect or application of the California
7 Coastal Act of 1976 (Division 20 (commencing with Section 30000) of the Public Resources Code), except that the local government 8 shall not be required to hold public hearings for coastal

9 development permit applications for accessory dwelling units.
Gov't Code § 65852.2, subd. (l).
10 53. The Coastal Commission has interpreted this explicit reservation as Naficy M0qD8 11 requiring local agencies to continue evaluating CDP applications for ADU permits
12 according to their certified LCP, even if the current local regulations conflict with

13 the new state law.

14 54. In an April 2020 Guidance Memo to the planning directors of coastal '5
OOyJ0 MD7 15 cities and counties, Coastal Commission executive director John Ainsworth advised

16 that despite recent updates to the state law, "existing ADU provisions contained in
certified LCPs are not superseded by Government Code section 65852.2 and 17 continue to apply to CDP applications for ADUs until an LCP amendment is
18 adopted." While LCP policies that "directly conflict with the new provisions . . .
19 should be updated to be consistent with the new ADU provision to the greatest
20 extent feasible," the Coastal Commission encouraged local governments to "ensure
21 that any proposed ADU-related LCP amendment appropriately addresses protection

22 of coastal resources consistent with the Coastal Act."

23 55. On March 12, 2021, the Coastal Commission found substantial issues

24 with several ADU CDPs issued by the County of San Luis Obispo due, in part, to

25 lack of conformance with the County's certified LCP regulations regarding ADUs.

26 Although the County had already proposed an amendment to bring its LCP into
closer alignment with the updated version of Government Code Section 65852.2
27 that went into effect on January 1, 2020, the Coastal Commission staff reports

PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF M D COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 14-

1 explained that the County's LCP amendment had not yet been certified by the

2 Coastal Commission and therefore could not be used as the basis for a CDP

3 approval. Neither could the County rely on provisions of Government Code section

4 65852.2 to excuse the nonconformance.
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 5
(Violation of Municipal Code Section 17.117) 6

7 56. Petitioners incorporate by reference each and every allegation

8 contained in the preceding paragraphs of this Petition as though fully set forth
herein. 9

10 57. The Project is inconsistent with various provisions of Pismo Beach City
Naficy MDq09 11 Code Section 17.117, including but not limited to the following:

12 Pursuant to section 17.117.070, subdivision (B), the minimum parcel
size is 5,000 square feet, however the parcel in question is only 4,000
13 square feet;

0 The ADU is more than fifty percent of the primary residence's living 14 area, which is only 1072 square feet, in violation of section 17.117.070,
e0 JO MDT 15 subdivision (F), which provides that the gross floor area of an accessory
dwelling unit "shall not exceed the lesser of fifty percent 50%) of the
16 primary unit's existing living area or eight hundred (800) square feet; The proposed ADU does not meet the minimum setback requirements, 17 which are at least 5 feet from the side and rear lot lines for an
18 ADU that is built on an existing garage. PBMC § 17.117.070, subd. (E)(3). This unit is not built on an "existing" garage, but in any event
19 does not meet the minimum 5-foot requirement; The ADU does not meet the 20-foot minimum front set back 20 requirement from the front elevation of the new garage to the property
21 line at Water Street;
The new garage is not set back at least 10' per PBMC section
22 17.38.150;

€ Not all parking spaces meet the minimum 9-foot width, as one space 23 appears to be approximately 8' 4", far less than the 9-foot minimum.

1 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Abuse of Discretion: Failure to proceed in the manner required by law)

3 58. Petitioners incorporate by reference each and every allegation
4 contained in the preceding paragraphs of this Petition as though fully set forth

5 herein.

6 59. The City failed to proceed as required by law, including its own
7 regulations, because the Project plans are inadequate, unclear, internally

8 inconsistent and lack sufficient detail, thereby precluding any adequate review of

9 the Project. The inadequacies of the Project plans also make it impossible determine

10 the details of the Project as approved.
AOYDN XDQD8 J0 eOYJ0 M07 o 60. The City failed to proceed in the manner required by concluding the
11 new garage could be grandfathered and would not be considered a new structure,
12 when in fact the evidence shows the applicants never intended to retain the original
13 garage and the total demolition was not pursuant a to a valid permit since the
14 demolition permit obtained by Applicants in August 2020 was only for the roof and

15 slab. Applicants applied for that demolition permit on July 30, 2020, allegedly prior

16 to their discovery of the termite damage.
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 17

18 (Findings not supported by substantial evidence)

19 61. Petitioners incorporate by reference each and every allegation

20 contained in the preceding paragraphs of this Petition as though fully set forth

21 herein.

62. 22 As demonstrated by the examples cited herein, the City's finding that

23 the Project as proposed complies with all applicable Zoning Code and Local Coastal

24 Plan provisions is not supported by substantial evidence.
63. The City's approval of the ACDP assumed the previous garage
25 before it was fully demolished was 500 square feet. The evidence, however, shows
26 that the previous garage was only 400 square feet. Accordingly, the City's implied
27

HPETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIP MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AN
INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 16-

1 finding that the previous garage was over 500 square feet is not supported by

2 substantial evidence.

3 64. The City's implied finding that the proposed garage is adequate and

4 consistent with the requirements of the City Code is not supported by substantial

5 evidence because the evidence shows, for example, that the garage door is not wide
enough to accommodate two cars if one car is already parked in the garage.
6
65. The City's implied finding that the Project does not jeopardize public
7 health and welfare is not supported by substantial evidence and is contradicted by
8 the fact that as proposed, the entrance to the ADU would be substantially less than
9 3 feet, which is the minimum standard for stairwell and hall passageways. The

10 narrow entrance corridor creates a substantial hazard to any first responders in the
Babak Naficy 11 event of an emergency such as fire or medical emergency.
