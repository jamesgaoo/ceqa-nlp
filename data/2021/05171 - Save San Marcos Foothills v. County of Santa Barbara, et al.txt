1 INTRODUCTION

2
1. Petitioner Save San Marcos Foothills ("Petitioner" or "SSMF") challenges Respondents
3 County of Santa Barbara and Board of Supervisors of the County of Santa Barbara's action
4 approving the grant of two easements over County open space and public park properties at the
5 San Marcos Foothills Preserve, and the County's subsequent approval of a Zoning Clearance
LO authorizing grading and development within the casement areas (hereafter "Project"). This
7 challenge is brought on grounds that Respondents' actions violate California Planning & Zoning
8 Law, the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), and constitute a prejudicial abuse of
9 discretion.
10
2. The two easements are for storm drain lines to serve residential development known as
11 the Preserve at San Marcos Terraces, and are located on property the County retained for open
12 space and public park purposes when the area was previously subdivided. The Board failed to
13 proceed in the manner required by law and prejudicially abused its discretion in approving the
14
grant of these easements® over County owned land without following mandatory procedure
15 required by Government Code section 65402, namely submitting the proposal to the County
16 Planning Commission to review and report as to its conformity with the County's adopted
17 general plan. The Board further violated Government Code section 65566 in approving the
18 disposal of an interest in open-space land that is inconsistent with the County's open-space plan.
19
3. After the Board's unlawful approval granting the storm drain easements to the developen
20 of the Preserve at San Marcos Terraces, the County approved a Zoning Clearance to authorize
21 construction of subdivision improvements to serve the eight residential lots, including drainage
22 facilities in the easement areas. The County failed to proceed in the manner required by law
23 and prejudicially abused its discretion in approving the Zoning Clearance when the Planning
24 Commission made no general plan consistency determination for the easement conveyance,
25 because the Zoning Clearance is inconsistent the County's adopted general plan, and because
26 the grading and construction authorized by the Zoning Clearance will result in significant
27 environmental impacts that require environmental review under CEQA.

1085 and 1094.5 alleges as follows:

4 PARTIES

5. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 4 as if fully set forth
6
herein.
7
6. Petitioner Save San Marcos Foothills (SSMF) is an unincorporated association dedicated
8 to the protection and permanent preservation of the threatened undeveloped open space at the
San Marcos Foothills. Petitioner, through its members, supporters and representatives,
10 participated in the proceedings below, including by providing oral comments to Respondent
11 Board of Supervisors, to other inferior arms of the County, and to County staff, to the extent
12 that opportunities for such participation were afforded. Petitioner has made various requests for
13 information and documentation from County concerning the Project and associated processes,
14 with some requests fulfilled and others unfulfilled as of the date of this Petition. Petitioner is
15
interested in preserving the integrity of the environment of the West Mesa of the San Marcos
16 Foothills ("West Mesa", where the Terraces Project is located) including its unique, rare and
17 endangered ecological guilds providing particularly significant habitat, such as that created by
18 the ancient fanglomerate boulderfield on the West Mesa and ecotomes afforded by adjacent and
19 nearby native and perennial grasslands, chaparral, ripárian woodlands and wetlands that provide
20 essential habitat for a number of locally and regionally significant plant and animal species
21 including and assemblage of birds that are grassland seedeaters (numerous species of sparrow,
22 towhee, junco, dove, blackbird and bunting) and birds of prey (various species of kite, hawk,
23 owl, vulture and falcon) that are each supported by the of terrestrial and subterranean habitat
24 present on the West Mesa of the San Marcos Foothills. Petitioner seeks to prevent the Project's
25
degradation of and to enhance the visual resources provided by the West Mesa and that are
26 visible from many important publicly-accessible viewing places throughout the County's South
27 Coast. Petitioner seeks to protect water supply and water quality and associated riparian and
28 aquatic resources on the West Mesa and lower in the watersheds that receive surface and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 2
Save San Marcos Foothills v. County of Santa Barbara and Board of Supervisors

subsurface flows from the West Mesa. Petitioner seeks to protect cultural and historic resourcesl

2 present on the West Mesa to respect and honor the First Peoples of the region and their modern

3 day descendants, and the culture they strive to maintain and advance. Petitioner seeks to

4 prevent development that increases community risks in extreme high fire hazard areas, and for

5 the West Mesa's vegetation to be managed in a manner that enhances protection of urban areas

6 to the south from the frequency and magnitude of wildfire risks. Petitioner possesses beneficial

7 interests in this proceeding, on its own stead and on behalf of its members, that will be

8 adversely affected by the violations Planning & Zoning Law, CEQA, and by approval of the

9 Project. These claims and the relief sought are broad-based such that the participation of

10 individual members is not required.

11 7. Petitioner's members and supporters include individuals that regularly visit the West

12 Mesa for recreation, spiritual reflection, psychological nourishment, mental recharge, and for

13 healthful and socially-distanced physical exercise in the era of COVID-19. The West Mesa

14 possesses characteristics of wilderness lands unlike any other nearby publicly accessible open

15 space areas, affording Petitioner and its members and supporters opportunities to observe birds

16 and wildlife, enjoy views of the Santa Barbara Channel and experience its unique vantage from

17 which to enjoy sunrises and sunsets, lunar activities and other celestial events, and daytime

18 uses, all of which are routinely enjoyed by Petitioner's members, supporters, and the

19 community at large, which would be irreparably harmed if the Project proceeds without

20 compliance with applicable laws and procedures. Petitioner's supporters include number of

21 individuals and other community organizations, including Committees for Land, Air, Water and

22 Species, Inc.

23 8. Respondent County of Santa Barbara is organized under the laws and Constitution of the

24 State of California. The County is empowered, among other duties, to provide for the orderly

25 planning and management of land use within its borders, subject to the obligations and

26 limitations of all applicable state, federal and other laws, including Government Code sections

27 65402 and 65566, and CEQA. The County is the lead agency under CEQA.

21 STANDING

22 13. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 12 as if fully set forth
23 herein.

24 14. Approval of the Project will adversely affect the interests of Petitioner SSMF and

25 SSMF's members and supporters. SSMF's members and supporters reside, visit, view and own
26 property in the area affected by the Project. Petitioner's supporters, representatives and
27 predecessors have commented and objected to the lack of compliance with Government Code
28 65402 and Government Code protections for open space areas, the lack of CEQA compliance,

1 violations of the County's General Plan, and have participated at the public hearing before the

2 Board of Supervisors. The Zoning Clearance approved by the Planning Development

3 Department was not noticed and is not subject to an administrative appeal, but Petitioner's

4 representatives nonetheless sought information from Planning and Development Department

5 staff and raised objections concerning County compliance with applicable processes, the lack of

6 Project information and documentation, changed circumstances, and the nature of changes to

7 the Project. Accordingly, Petitioner, including members and supporters of SSMF, are

8 "aggrieved persons" within the meaning of Public Resources Code Section 21177.

10 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

11 15. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth

12 herein.

13 16. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this petition by raising

14 each and every issue known to them before the County, in compliance with Public Resources

21 18. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 17 as if fully set forth
22 herein.
23 19. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the California Constitution, Article
24 VI, Section 10, because this case is not a cause given by statute to other trial courts.
25 Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Sections
26 1085 and 1094.5; California Public Resources Code Section 21167; CEQA Guidelines Section
27 15112; and applicable law.
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 5 Save San Marcos Foothills v. County of Santa Barbara and Board of Supervisors

1 20. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §9393, 394 because

2 Petitioner SSMF, through its principal place of business and through the residences and of its

3 members, and Respondents' principal place of business and County seat are located within the

4 Southern portion of the County of Santa Barbara, and because the causes of action alleged in

5 this Petition arose in the Southern portion of the County of Santa Barbara.

6 21. This Court has jurisdiction over the County of Santa Barbara and the Board of

7 Supervisors of the County of Santa Barbara because the County is an agency established by the

8 legislature of the State of California with its principal place of business located in the City and

9 County of Santa Barbara.

10 22. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless

11 this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their

12 approvals of the grant of easements and Zoning Clearance. In the absence of such remedies, the

13 County's approvals will remain in effect in violation of state law.

14

15 STATEMENT OF FACTS

16 23.
17 Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs through 22 as if fully set forth
herein.
18
24. San Marcos Foothills is a prominent open space area in the unincorporated portion of the
19 South County, located immediately east of Highway 154 and north of Foothill Road. Various
20 proposals to subdivide and develop the San Marcos Foothills for residential use have been
21 circulated for several decades. The numerous site constraints and deep community concern
22

23 over the loss of a prominent and important area that has been utilized openly by the public for
many decades, prevented any of those proposals from proceeding to construction. In the early
24

25 2000's, yet another proposal for residential development was submitted to the County for
processing.
26 25.
27 The County prepared an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Preserve at San
Marcos Project, which the County certified in 2005. The EIR, as modified by a Revision Letter
28 specific to the Project alternative proposed for approval (Alternative #4), identifies significant

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 6 Save San Marcos Foothills v. County of Santa Barbara and Board of Supervisors

1 impacts in the areas of aesthetics, air quality, biological resources, cultural resources, fire

2 protection, landslides/slope stability, erosion/sedimentation, traffic, drainage and water quality,

3 and identifies Class I significant and unmitigable impacts from loss of on-site vegetation, native

4 grasslands, and coastal sage scrub, as well as loss and displacement of wildlife species and

5 habitat, decline of sensitive wildlife, and disturbance of local movement from on-site habitat

6 fragmentation.

7 26. The Board of Supervisors approved the Preserve at San Marcos Project (Alternative #4)

8 on November 21, 2005, including a Development Plan (01DVP-00000-00071) and Tract Map

9 (01TRM-00000-00005) creating 16 residential lots, three lots dedicated to the County for a

10 public park, a private open space parcel held in common ownership by the Homeowners

11 Association, two open space/no development parcels, and a 200-acre Designated Remainder

12 Lot. The residential lots are clustered in two areas known as "the Meadows" on the castern

13 portion, and "the Terrace" on the western portion. Since the Board's approval, only "the

14 Meadows" residences have been constructed. Following the County's approval, the prior

15 developer donated the 200 acre Designated Remainder lot to the Trust for Public Lands, who in

16 turn donated these lands to the County of Santa Barbara for open space uses. Additionally, the

17 County funded improvements and adopted an interim and final management plan for the Countyl

18 Park and Designated Remainder.

19 27. In 2006 the Board of Supervisors adopted a set of Residential Design Guidelines for the

20 Eastern Goleta Valley Community Plan area (including the project area) and in 2015, the Board

21 of Supervisors adopted the Eastern Goleta Valley Community Plan itself, which includes a

22 number of general and parcel-specific policies that apply to the Project.
23 28. Real party is now actively seeking approvals to advance residential development of "the

24 Terraces", located on the western portion of the San Marcos Foothills (aka the "West Mesa")

25 adjacent to Highway 154. These approvals include the grant of easements and Zoning

26 Clearance challenged in this action, as well as design review approvals sought for the individual

27 homes (for which Petitioner has administrative appeals pending), and unknown other

28 entitlements and approvals needed to perfect the fifteen year old development approvals.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 7
Save San Marcos Foothills v. County of Santa Barbara and Board of Supervisors

Additionally, on August 30, 2019 Real Party sought a different non-exclusive easement, for a

2 waterline to serve residential development at the Terraces, which the Planning Commission
reviewed for conformity with the Comprehensive Plan pursuant to Government Code $65402(a)
on October 2, 2019. The Planning Commission determined the easement grant conformed with
the Comprehensive Plan, despite encroachment into minimum buffers protecting

6 environmentally sensitive habitat areas and riparian corridors, in part because no physical
development was involved with the grant of easement itself, and future physical development
was being evaluated under a separate application. On February 11, 2020, the Board of
Supervisors approved the proposed grant of easement, after considering a CEQA Addendum

10 prepared for the new waterline and the Planning Commission's recommendation of General

11 Plan conformity.

12 29. On October 13, 2020, the Board approved the grant of two non-exclusive easements for

13 storm drain lines to serve the proposed residences at the Terraces. One easement is 15-feet wide

14 and approximately 135.06-feet long, located across a portion of the County-owned Designated

15 Remainder ("Easement 1"). The other easement is a triangular area of approximately 654

16 square feet on a portion of the County-owned park parcel ("Easement 2"). Unlike the Board's

17 February 11, 2020 easement approval, the Board had no Planning Commission recommendation

18 as to General Plan conformity, and no CEQA document analyzing the impact of proposed storm
19 drain lines, including impacts to mapped environmentally sensitive habitat arcas in the

20 immediate vicinity. Counsel for Petitioner appeared at the Board hearing and raised both
21 procedural and substantive objections to the approval, including the claims raised herein
22 specific to the easement approval.

23 30. On December 17, 2020, Planning and Development staff approved Zoning Clearance No.

24 19ZCI-00000-00142, which permits grading and construction of subdivision improvements

25 within the Terrace's portion of the Preserve at San Marcos, including grading, drainage and

26 roadway improvements to serve eight residential lots. The improvements include 2,179 sq. ft.

27 of net new public asphalt concrete roadway, 90,306 sq. ft. of private asphalt concrete roadway,
28 14,795 cubic yards of cut and 7.900 cubic yards of fill, construction of two storm water

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 8
Save San Marcos Foothills v. County of Santa Barbara and Board of Supervisors

1 detention basins and associated drainage facilities, construction of public and private portions of

2 roadways serving the Terraces, installation of water lines, electric, gas, cable, and telephone

3 utilities, installation of drainage infrastructure, staging and wash-off areas, and protective

4 fencing. The drainage facilities authorized by this Zoning Clearance are located, in part, within

5 Easements 1 and 2. The County did not conduct CEQA review for the Zoning Clearance and

6 prior environmental review documents did not include 1 Easements 1 and 2. As a consequence

7 the environmental impact of constructing drainage facilities within Easements 1 and 2 have not

8 been evaluated. Per County ordinance, Zoning Clearances are not noticed and are non-

9 appealable except through judicial challenge.

10 31. Respondents have abused their discretion and have failed to comply with the law in the

11 following ways:

12

13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (Violations of State Planning and Zoning Laws: Gov. Code § 65000, et seq.)

15 32. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 31 as if fully set forth

16 herein.

17 Failure to Comply with Government Code Section 65402(a) Prior to Approving Grant of

18 Easement over County-Owned Property

19 33. The County's General Plan is referred to as the "Comprehensive Plan" and includes a

20 number of issue-specific elements, such as the Open Space Element, as well as the Eastern

21 Goleta Valley Community Plan ("EGVCP") which applies to the Project area. Government

22 Code 65402(a) provides:
23 If a general plan or part thereof has been adopted, ... no real property shall be disposed

24 of, no street shall be vacated or abandoned, and no public building or structure shall be constructed or authorized, if the adopted general plan or part thereof applies thereto, until
25 the location, purpose and extent of such acquisition or disposition, such street vacation or

26 abandonment, or such public building or structure have been submitted to and reported upon by the planning agency as to conformity with said adopted general plan or part

27 thereof. The planning agency shall render its report as to conformity with said adopted general plan or part thereof within forty (40) days after the matter was submitted to it, or
28 such longer period of time as may be designated by the legislative body.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 9 Save San Marcos Foothills V. County of Santa Barbara and Board of Supervisors

1 As provided by Article V, Chapter 2 of the County Code, the County Planning Commission is

2 designated as the "planning agency" for the unincorporated potion of the County located outside

3 of the Montecito Community Plan Area.

4 34. With respect to Easements 1 and 2, the 1 County did not submit the location, purpose and

5 extent of the easement disposition to the County Planning Commission, and the Planning

6 Commission did not report as to the conformity of the easement disposition with the

7 Comprehensive Plan and EGVCP. The Board approved of the disposition of Easement 1 and 2

8 without the Planning Commission completing its mandatory general plan conformity review,

9 and accordingly failed to proceed in the manner required by law.

10 35. By contrast, with respect to the waterline easement, the location, purpose and extent of

11 the easement were described in a Staff Report to the Planning Commission, and the Planning

12 Commission deliberated and rendered a report as to the conformity of the easement disposition
13 with the adopted general plan including with Land Use Element Development Policy 4, EGVCP
14 Policy ECO-EGV-5.5 and Development Standard ECO-EGV-5A.

15 36. Easements 1 and 2 are located within and/or immediately adjacent to mapped

16 Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Overlay areas, triggering the application of various

17 Comprehensive Plan and EGVCP provisions including but not limited to the following:
18 a. Eastern Goleta Valley Community Plan Policy ECO-EGV-5.5: (INLAND)

19 Minimum Buffer Areas for ESH: The minimum buffer strip and setbacks from streams and creeks for development and activities within the ESH overlay that are
20 regulated by the County Zoning Ordinances shall be as follows, except on parcels

21 designated for agriculture in rural areas where Policy ECO-EGV-5.6 shall apply: ESH areas within the Urban Area and EDRNs: a minimum setback of 50 feet from

22 either side of top-of-bank of creeks or existing edge of riparian vegetation, whichever is further, shall be indicated on all site plans. Plans shall minimize
23 ground disturbance and vegetation removal.

24 b. Eastern Goleta Valley Community Plan DevStd ECO-EGV-5A: ESH and RC

25 Setbacks and Buffers: Development within 100 feet of ESH or RC areas shall be required to include setbacks or undeveloped buffer zones from these areas
26 consistent with the habitat protection policies of this section as part of the

27 proposed development, except where setbacks or buffers would preclude reasonable use of the parcel. Public recreational trails shall be allowed within

28 setbacks or buffer areas. In determining the location, width and extent of setbacks

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 10
Save San Marcos Foothills v. County of Santa Barbara and Board of Supervisors

1 and/or buffer areas, the County's biological resources andlor vegetation maps

2 and other available data shall be used (e.g., maps, studies, or observations).

3 37. The Project causes encroachment by incompatible development, degrading the visual

4 character and aesthetics of the existing trail, conflicting with EGVCP Policies PRT-EGV-6.4, -

5 6.5 and -7.6, among others.

6 38. In addition to the specific policies of the EGVCP, numerous other elements of the

7 General Plan contain policies, action items, development standards and provide generalize

8 policy guidance that control and/or are applicable to the Project and lands in question, including

9 the Conservation Element, Open Space Element, Environmental Resource Management

10 Element, Land Use Element, and the Seismic and Safety Element. The Project conflicts with

11 these General Plan elements, individually and collectively.

12 39. Without any determination of conformity with these and other applicable policies, and

13 Easement 1 and 2's apparent encroachment into protected ESH and/or ESH buffer areas harm to

14 sensitive biological resources, impacts to recreational facilities and cultural resources, not only

15 is the Board's approval of the grant of Easements and 2 contrary to law, but it constitutes a

16 prejudicial abuse of discretion.

17

18 Failure to Comply with Government Code Section 65566 Prior to Approving the Grant of

19 Easements over County-Owned Property

20 40. In adopting California Government Code sections 65560 et seq. (Open-Space Lands), the

21 Legislature declared that "the preservation of open-space land, as defined in this article, is

22 necessary not only for the maintenance of the economy of the state, but also for the assurance of

23 the continued availability of land for the production of food and fiber, for the enjoyment of

24 scenic beauty, for recreation and for the use of natural resources." (Gov. Code 66561(a)).

25 Accordingly, "every city and county shall prepare, adopt and submit to the Secretary of the

26 Resources Agency a local open-space plan for the comprehensive and long-range preservation

27 and conservation of open-space land within its jurisdiction" (Gov. Code § 65563) and "[a]ny

28 action by a county or city by which open-space land or any interest therein is acquired or

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 11
Save San Marcos Foothills v. County of Santa Barbara and Board of Supervisors

disposed of or its use restricted or regulated, whether or not pursuant to this part, must be

2 consistent with the local open-space plan." (Gov. con Code § 65566)

3 41. Easements 1 and 2 are located on land designated for open-space uses, however the

4 Board did not consider whether disposing of this easement is consistent with the County's open-
space plan. The approval of each of these easements enables the closure of the easement arcas

6 from public use for construction activities, including the destruction of habitat, disturbance of
cultural and natural resources present thereon, the installation of subsurface and surface

8 drainage and flood control facilities, and the permanent alternation of open space. These

9 activities will have temporary and permanent impacts to the public's ability to use these areas

10 and degrade the quality and nature of such use. For example, Easement 2 and an associated

11 detention basin (not detailed in the 2005 approval and only finally specifically described in the

12 2020 Grading Plans associated with the Zoning Clearance) entail development activities and the
13 installation of permanent infrastructure in or immediately adjacent to the current and proposed
14 alignment of the principal trail providing public access from parking areas on Via Gaitero

15 (where the entrance to the County Park is located) to the majority of the County Park lands and

16 the 200 acres of the "Designated Remainder" beyond. The Project Grading Plans and Zoning

17 Clearance do not accommodate the principal public access trail to the County Park, incorrectly
18 describe the existing terrain, and make no apparent accommodation for the public trail in the

19 design for the newly added private storm drain on the County's Park lands.

20 42. Although the County apparently does not have a stand-alone designated open-space plan

21 the County has contended that its General Plan and Community Plans are included in its Open

22 Space Plan. The EGVCP contemplates only the acquisition of additional public recreational

23 resources, requiring the public recreational trails "shall be protected, preserved and provided

24 for". Policy PRT-EGV-5.1. No policy of the EGVCP or any other element of the County's

25 open space plan authorizes or contemplates the disposition of rights of use and construction of

26 private infrastructure on public park and open space lands that interfere with public use of trails

27 on designated park and open space lands.

28

Save San Marcos Foothills V. County of Santa Barbara and Board of Supervisors

1 43. Without any determination of conformity with these and other applicable provisions of

2 the County's open-space plan, and the Easements' apparent conflict with the provisions of the

3 EGVCP and the General Plan, not only is the Board's approval of the grant of the Easements

4 contrary to law, but it constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

6 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

7 (Violations of CEQA: Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000, et seq.)

8 44. Petitioner hereby re-alleges and incorporates the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1

9 through 43, inclusive.

10 45. The County abused its discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by CEQA by

11 approving the Zoning Clearance authorizing the installation of drainage facilities within

12 Easements and 2 without conducting review of its environmental impact. None of the prior

13 environmental review documents for the Preserve at San Marcos Project included this

14 development in the Project Description, or analyzed its impacts.

15 46. Easements and 2 are located in the immediate vicinity of mapped environmentally
16 sensitive habitat areas and a public hiking trail, in an area known for geologic instability and

17 subterranean cultural resources. It is reasonably foresecable that the grading and development

18 permitted by the Terraces Zoning Clearance will result in significant environmental impacts to

19 environmentally sensitive habitat and other sensitive resources, as well as significant impacts

20 resulting from inconsistencies with Comprehensive Plan policies discussed above.

21 47. For these reasons, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion and failed to proceedl

22 in accordance with CEQA.
