3 against Respondents California Air Resources Board ("CARB" or "Respondent") and

4 Richard Corey in his official capacity as Executive Officer of CARB (collectively,

5 "Respondents"), pursuant to Section 21080.5 of the Public Resources Code and Section

7 certain decisions made by Respondents described below and to enforce compliance with the

8 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Sections 21000 et seq. of the Public

9 Resources Code); (2) a declaration and judgment pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code of

10 Civil Procedure and Section 11350 of the Government Code that Respondents' acts,

11 omissions, and findings did not comply with CEQA and section 11346.3(a) of the

12 Government Code; and (3) injunctive relief pursuant to Sections 525-526 of the Code of

13 Civil Procedure to enjoin implementation and/or enforcement of the Amended Regulation;

14 and for its petition and complaint ("Petition") alleges as follows:

15 INTRODUCTION

16 1. This Petition seeks to set aside an amended regulation adopted by

17 Respondents on August 27, 2020 in violation of California law, including the California

18 Administrative Procedure Act, various provisions of the California Health & Safety Code,

19 and CEQA.

20 2. Specifically, this Petition seeks to set aside Respondents' August 27, 2020

21 approval of amendments to the existing Airborne Toxic Control Measure ("ATCM") for

22 Auxiliary Diesel Engines Operated on Ocean-Going Vessels At-Berth in a California Port

23 (as amended, the "Amended Regulation"). The Amended Regulation adopted by

24 Respondents, as applied to marine tanker vessels calling on California ports and terminals,

25 cannot be implemented safely and feasibly in the timeframes required. Moreover, despite

26 repeated requests by WSPA and others, Respondents have arbitrarily refused to conduct a

27 feasibility study to determine whether and how the Amended Regulation could safely be

28
- 2 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

- applied to tanker vessels. Respondents' actions violate their legal duties under California

2 law to assess these important feasibility and safety concerns before adopting a proposed

3 regulation.

4 3. Instead of properly addressing the serious safety and feasibility concerns of

5 the Amended Regulation, Respondents initially proposed to adopt unrealistic tanker

6 compliance deadlines that did not allow for a feasibility study. Respondents then

7 accelerated those deadlines without any evidentiary support that tanker terminals could

8 even meet the originally proposed deadlines, let alone the accelerated ones, and ignoring

9 the evidence in the record showing that tanker terminals could not safely and feasibly meet
10 either the original or the accelerated deadlines.

11 4. In adopting the Amended Regulation, Respondents also have arbitrarily

12 chosen to continue relying on overly optimistic projections of future economic activity and

13 emissions that predated the COVID-19 pandemic, and which now utterly ignore the most

14 serious national economic crisis since the Great Depression. Respondents' disregard for the

15 state's dramatically changed economic circumstances, and the calamitous effects of the

16 pandemic on the petroleum industry, results in an unsupportable overstatement of future

17 tanker vessel activity at California's ports and terminals, which in turn greatly exaggerates

18 Respondents' claimed emission reduction benefits of the Amended Regulation with respect

19 to tanker vessels.

20 5. In addition, Respondents adopted the Amended Regulation despite failing to

21 publicly disclose for several months - data from their own third-party commissioned

22 study of marine tanker vessel emissions, indicating that tankers emit far less oxides of

23 nitrogen ("NOx") and particulate matter ("PM") than Respondents assumed in public
24 rulemaking documents on the Amended Regulation. Respondents' failure to address or

25 even publicly disclose this data from their own commissioned study - data that contradict

26 most of Respondents' assumptions about marine tanker emissions - is an abuse of

27 discretion and a violation of Respondents' clear legal duties to properly consider emissions

28
3

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

- data that bear directly on the claimed need for and promised benefits of the Amended

2 Regulation.

3 6. Moreover, in adopting the Amended Regulation, Resolution 20-22, Control

4 Measure for Ocean-Going Vessels At Berth, Respondents relied on an Environmental

5 Analysis ("EA") that understates, mischaracterizes and ignores the significant adverse

6 impacts resulting from their action. Respondents have thereby violated their duties under

7 CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of Regulations Sections15000,

8 et seq., to provide the public and the agency decision-makers with a complete, balanced and

9 accurate evaluation of the environmental impacts of the Amended Regulation

10 7. As illustrative examples of Respondents' numerous CEQA violations in this

11 matter:

12 Respondents failed to analyze the Amended Regulation's full panoply of

13 potentially significant environmental effects, and omitted, obscured and ignored relevant

14 information showing the true nature and extent of these significant effects;

15 Respondents failed to adequately analyze the harmful impacts to biological

16 resources from the various in-water and shoreline construction activities needed to comply

17 with the Amended Regulation, including adverse effects on special-status fish and wildlife

18 species and sensitive habitats that Respondent barely mentions in its EA;

19 Respondents failed to adequately evaluate the cumulative environmental

20 effects resulting from the Amended Regulation in combination with other past, present and

21 reasonably foreseeable future projects affecting the same environmental resources as the
22 Amended Regulation;

23 Respondents failed to adequately assess the effects of the Amended
24 Regulation in increasing the risk of a hazardous incident such as a fire or an explosion,

25 which could cause catastrophic impacts on human health and safety and the environment,

26 by forcing marine terminals and tanker vessels to modify their facilities and operations in

27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

*4

2 handling dangerous flammable cargoes to implement an untested new technology, under an

3 unrealistic compliance deadline, that has not been shown to be safe or feasible;

4 Respondents improperly relied on an inadequate programmatic review to

5 avoid conducting a thorough analysis of the potential effects from the Amended Regulation,

6 even though they had the information available to conduct this type analysis as required by
CEQA;

7

8 Respondents adopted an implementation timeline and measures that are
"infeasible" as defined in CEQA;

9

10 Respondents failed to analyze reasonable project alternatives; and

11 Respondents adopted findings and a statement f overriding considerations

12 that are not supported by substantial evidence in the record and that misstate the Amended
Regulation's impacts and purported benefits.

13 8.

14 Respondents further violated CEQA by failing to recirculate the EA for

15 additional public review and comment after adding significant new information as defined

16 in CEQA Guidelines Section 15088.5. Respondents then compounded this violation by

17 providing only a two-day window for public review of the Final EA and responses to

18 comments on the Draft EA, thus precluding meaningful participation by the public and
affected stakeholders in Respondents' CEQA process.

19 9.

20 For these reasons, and as further alleged herein, Respondents prejudicially

21 abused their discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law, in violation of

CEQA.

22 10.

23 In taking these and other actions, Respondents also violated California Code

24 of Civil Procedure Section 1085 by ignoring the great weight of evidence in the rulemaking

25 record on the Amended Regulation, and instead arbitrarily and capriciously adopting

26 emissions control mandates on marine tanker vessels before properly assessing their safety

27 and feasibility, the validity of the Amended Regulation's promised future benefits, the

28
- 5 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

accuracy of claimed tanker emissions in the face of directly contradictory evidence, and the

2 environmental impacts of the Amended Regulation.

3 11. Accordingly, this Petition seeks a writ of mandate adjudging that

4 Respondents' actions were arbitrary, capricious, contrary to law and of no legal force or

5 effect, and commanding Respondents to set aside and vacate their actions in adopting or

6 implementing the Amended Regulation, and declaratory and injunctive relief as alleged

7 herein.

8 PARTIES

9 12. WSPA is non-profit trade association, formed and existing under the laws

10 of California. Founded in 1907, and headquartered in Sacramento, WSPA is the oldest

11 petroleum trade association in the United States. WSPA is an advocate for the oil and gas

12 industry in California, whose essential mission is to help its members provide adequate,

13 reliable and affordable sources of energy and ensure that Americans continue to have

14 reliable access to petroleum and petroleum products through policies that are socially,
15 economically, and environmentally responsible. WSPA's members explore for, produce,

16 refine, transport and market petroleum, petroleum products, natural gas and other energy

17 supplies in California and four other western states. WSPA and its members have an

18 interest in continued operations "at berth" -- operations at marine terminals hosting vessels

19 carrying hazardous materials, crude oil and other petroleum products - and in the lawful

20 regulation of marine tanker activity at California's ports and terminals. WSPA has a

21 special interest in the safety of personnel responsible for working closely with tankers at

22 berth. These interests would be frustrated, and the safety and well-being of port and

23 terminal workers would be placed at risk, without a decision in WSPA's favor in this

24 action. WSPA has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this action and has

25 exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

26 13. WSPA is also beneficially interested in the correct and lawful application of

27 Respondent's mandated rulemaking procedures, and its public planning and environmental

28
- 6 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

review processes bearing on the adoption of the Amended Regulation. WSPA seeks to

2 ensure that Respondents take into account the evidence in the rulemaking record of the real-

3 world risks, impacts and costs of the Amended Regulation, and that the public and

4 Respondents' decision-makers have all environmental information required under CEQA

5 and other necessary information, so that the public can meaningfully participate in

6 Respondents' decision-making process and the agency decision-makers can make informed,

7 reasonable and lawful decisions supported by the available evidence.

8 14. WSPA participated extensively in the rulemaking proceeding for the

9 Amended Regulation, and submitted numerous written and verbal comments to

10 Respondents setting forth its objections to the Amended Regulation challenged herein.

11 WSPA provided written comments to Respondents as part of a continuing effort to provide

12 feedback on the Amended Regulation, including comments submitted on February 15,

13 March 29, May 30, June 14, and August 15, 2019. On December 3, 2019 and March 6,

14 May 1, July 27 and August 27, 2020, WSPA submitted written comments to Respondents

15 setting forth its objections to the Amended Regulation and the Draft and Final EA

16 challenged herein and incorporating prior comment letters. WSPA's comment letters

17 identify numerous issues with the Amended Regulation that were never corrected in the

18 final version of the Amended Regulation. Comment letters (which incorporate prior letters)

19 are attached as Exhibits A-G to this Petition.

20 15. Based on the foregoing, WSPA has standing to bring this action on behalf of

21 itself and its members.

22 16. Respondent CARB is an agency of the State of California. CARB is the

23 "lead agency" for purposes of Public Resources Code Section 21067, with principal

24 responsibility for conducting environmental review for and approving the Amended

25 Regulation.

26

- 17. Respondent Richard Corey is the current Executive Officer of CARB, who is

2 made a party to this action in his official capacity only. Mr. Corey acts as the director and

3 manager of the CARB professional and other staff personnel, who all report to him.

4 18. Petitioner is unaware of the true names of Respondents sued herein as Does

5 through 10, inclusive. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that

6 Respondent Does 1-10, inclusive, are individuals, entities or agencies with authority to

7 approve and/or with an interest in the Amended Regulation alleged herein. When the true

8 identities and capacities of these Respondents have been determined, Petitioner will, with

9 leave of Court if necessary, amend this Petition to insert such identities and capacities.

10 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

11 19. This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to the California

12 Constitution, Article VI, Section 10, Code of Civil Procedure Section 1085, and Public

13 Resources Code Sections 21168, 21168.5, and 21168.9.

14 20. Section 21080.5 of the Public Resources Code and Section 1085 of the Code

15 of Civil Procedure provide for review in this Court of actions by state agencies and their

16 officers to determine whether those actions comply with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines and

17 other CEQA implementing regulations.

18 21. Sections 525 and 526 of the Code of Civil Procedure provide for an

19 injunction when the complaint shows that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded,

20 and the relief, or any part thereof, consists in restraining the commission or continuance of

21 the act complained of.

22 22. Section 1060 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides for a judicial

23 declaration of Petitioner's rights and Respondents' duties in a case of actual controversy

24 relating to those legal rights and duties of the respective parties.

25 23. Accordingly, and based on the fácts stated in this Petition, this Court has
26 jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief., declaratory relief and to issue a writ of mandate on

27 the claims presented.

- 24. Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to Section 401 of the Code of Civil

2

3 Procedure because CARB is a state agency, Mr. Corey is a state officer, and the Attorney

4 General of the State of California has an office located in the City and County of Los

5 Angeles. In addition, operations at many ports, terminals and berths that would be affected
by the Amended Regulation are located in the County of Los Angeles.

6 25.

7 Petitioner provided written notice of its intention to commence this action to

8 Respondents, in compliance with Public Resources Code Section 21167.5. A copy of that
notice and proof of service is attached as Exhibit H to this Petition.

9 26.

10 Concurrent with the filing of this Petition, Petitioner has filed a notice

11 requesting that the Respondent CARB prepare the administrative record for this action, in

12 accordance with Public Resources Code Section 21167.6(a). This notice is attached as Ex.

I.

13 27.

14 Petitioner sent a copy of this Petition to the California Attorney General to

15 comply with Public Resources Code Section 21167.7. A copy of that letter is attached as

Exhibit J to this Petition.

16 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

17 A.

18 Respondents' Initial Evaluation of Draft Concepts for the Amended
Regulation.

19 28. California has the most stringent air quality regulations in the world, and

20 imposes rigorous requirements on emissions of many types of air contaminants, including

21 nitrogen oxides ("NOx"), sulfur oxides ("SOx") and diesel particulate matter ("DPM").

22 29. California has regulated certain at-berth marine vessel emissions since 2008.

23 See Title 17, Cal. Code Regs. ("C.C.R.") § 93118.3. The state also regulates commercial

24 harbor craft operating in state waters, and fuel use and emissions from ocean-going vessels

25 traveling within 24 nautical miles of California's coast or islands. See id. §§ 93118,

26 93118.2, 93118.5.

27 30. Respondents currently administer the world's most comprehensive at-berth

28 marine vessel regulation. Respondents' existing at-berth regulations (i.e., those in effect
- 9-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

-

2 prior to promulgation of the Amended Regulation) require control of NOx and DPM

3 emissions from auxiliary engines aboard container vessels, passenger vessels, and

4 refrigerated cargo vessels while docked at berth at a California port. This is accomplished

5 primarily by limiting the time during which these vessels' auxiliary diesel engines are
operated while such vessels are docked at the

6 port, though regulated parties may instead

7 choose to implement alternative emissions controls to achieve an equivalent emission

8 reduction to the emission reduction they would have achieved by limiting diesel engine
operation at berth. 17 C.C.R. § 93118.3(a), (d)(1), (d)(2).

9 31.

10 As of January 1, 2020, the existing at-berth regulations required no fewer

11 than 80% of port visits to meet applicable operating time limits, and no less than 80%

12 reduction of onboard auxiliary-diesel-engine power generation. 17 C.C.R.
§ 93118.3(d)(1)(C).

13 32. To date, California's existing ATCM regulations for vessels at-berth have
14 yielded significant reductions of emissions from marine vessels while at berth in California

15

16 ports and terminals. Respondents have projected that the current at-berth regulation will

17 reduce total DPM from marine vessel at-berth emissions by 96% by 2021 (from an initial

18 2006 baseline). These reductions have been well above even Respondents' projections
when the original at-berth regulation was adopted.

19 33.

20 Nevertheless, on March 23, 2017, Respondents, claiming that further

21 emissions reductions from vessels at berth were necessary, adopted resolutions directing

22 staff, "within 18 months of this date, [to] develop At-Berth regulation amendments that

23 achieve up to 100% compliance by 2030 for LA Ports and Ports that are in or adjacent to

24 areas in the top 10% of those defined as most impacted by" a specified screening
methodology.

25 34.

26 In August and September 2017, Respondents held two public workshops to

27 discuss draft regulatory concepts for amendments to the existing at-berth regulation as

28 directed by Respondents. The draft concepts included, among other things, a proposal to

10 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

-

2 broaden the existing regulation to include marine terminals as well as ports, and to include

3 additional marine vessel types -i.e., "roll-on, roll-off' cargo vessels, bulk and general
cargo vessels, and tanker vessels.

4 35.

5 In their public presentation materials for the August and September 2017

6 public workshops, Respondents acknowledged that tanker vessels - unlike other types of

7 marine vessels require "[s]pecialized terminals," have "[s]pecial safety concerns due to

8 flammable cargo," and "[c]an present greater implementation challenges versus other
of cargo vessels." types

9 36.

10 In those same presentations, Respondents also claimed that compared to all
other vessel types,

11 tanker vessels had "the highest CO2 and PM10 [i.e., PM with an

12 aerodynamic diameter less than 10 micrometers] emissions" and the "[s]econd highest NOx
emissions." Respondents premised these claims

13 on a 2016 emissions inventory that was
based largely on 2014 data regarding California vessel visits.

14 37.

15 Approximately a year after the 2017 public workshops, in July 2018,
Respondents held their next public workshop on draft amendments to the existing at-berth
16 regulation. As part of this presentation, Respondents proposed a schedule for implementing

17

18 new emissions control requirements on tanker vessels at berth in ports and terminals,

19 starting in phases in 2025 and 2031. Respondents presented no documentation in the 2017

20 public workshops explaining how those proposed implementation dates for tanker vessel

21 controls were either technologically achievable in practice at California marine terminals or
consistent with international or domestic tanker safety standards.

22 38.

23 On September 6 and 17, 2018, Respondents conducted public workshops to

24 present draft regulatory language and a preliminary cost analysis for a draft amendments to

25 the at-berth regulation. In its presentation and draft regulatory concepts documents,

26 Respondents asserted that tanker vessels would comply with the new requirements through

27 use of a "capture and control system" at berth, and claimed without evidentiary support that

28
- 11 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

P there was a "[f]easible option to capture tanker auxiliary boiler exhaust" in order for tanker

2 vessels to meet the draft requirements.

3 39. In its September 2018 preliminary cost analysis for the draft at-berth

4 regulatory proposal, Respondents projected that tanker vessels would bear some of the

5 highest annualized costs of implementation for the draft regulation, with the crude tanker

6 vessel fleet incurring an estimated $23.64 million in annualized costs by full

7 implementation in 2031.

8 40. In the September 2018 draft regulatory language, Respondents also proposed

9 to set default emission rates for tanker auxiliary boilers of 2.0 grams per kilowatt-hour for

10 NOx and 0.17 gram per kilowatt-hour for PM with a diameter of less than 2.5 micrometers

11 ("PM2.5"). Respondents based these rates on a nearly twenty-year-old (2002) consultant

12 report compiling data on vessels that were themselves over 20 years old at the time of the

13 report. Moreover, the vessels at that time were still using heavy No. 6 fuel oil, which was

14 permitted in 2002, but by 2018 had been prohibited for a decade. Those rates did not and

15 do not accurately reflect emission rates from most auxiliary engines in use today in the

16 modern tanker vessel fleet, which use the type of cleaner-burning, low sulfur distillate fuels

17 CARB has mandated since 2008.

18 41. Thus, since the September 2018 workshops, the emissions assumptions

19 Respondents have continued to advance publicly for tanker vessels are dramatically

20 exaggerated, and do not reflect real-world tanker vessel operations at California ports and

21 terminals. For this reason, Respondents have also systematically overstated projected

22 emissions reductions from tanker vessels in rulemaking for the Amended Regulation, and

23 thereby has consistently overestimated projected health benefits from its proposed

24 regulation of tanker vessels at berth.

25 B. WSPA Raises the Need for a Feasibility Study to Address Workability
and Safety of Emission Controls at Terminals Before They are 26 Required.

27

28
- 12 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

p 42. Starting in December 2018, WSPA and other regulated groups informed

2 Respondents that at-berth emissions capture and control for tanker vessels had never before

3 been demonstrated in real-world practice at marine terminals, and that attempting to

4 mandate such controls could present serious safety risks given the extremely flammable and

5 potentially explosive nature of tanker cargo, as well as the need to carefully utilize auxiliary

6 tanker boiler exhaust gases to prevent explosive atmospheres from developing in tanker

7 vessel cargo holds.

8 43. WSPA and other stakeholders also advised Respondents that installing the

9 type of massive capture and control equipment infrastructure needed at marine terminals

10 could pose intractable logistical and operational challenges that left serious doubt as to

11 whether such infrastructure could feasibly be installed at some terminals, particularly at

12 smaller terminals or those in constrained locations with very limited existing dockside

13 structure on which to build. Thus, as WSPA explained to Respondents, its compliance cost

14 and installation time estimates for marine terminals were likely substantially understated

15 and inaccurate.

16 44. For these and other reasons, WSPA and other stakeholders advised

17 Respondents that, before they adopted any new requirements for tanker vessels, they should

18 commission a feasibility study to assess whether and how such emissions controls could be

19 operated safely and effectively by tanker vessels at marine terminals. WSPA noted that

20 Respondents previously have conducted feasibility studies before mandating new or

21 unproven technologies, most notably in its 2006 evaluation of cold-ironing (i.e., the process

22 of providing land-based electrical power to a vessel at berth while the vessel's main and

23 auxiliary engines are turned off) for ocean-going vessels at California ports prior to

24 adopting cold-ironing mandates for such vessels.

25 45. Because there was no evidence that the emissions control systems to be

26 required by the draft Amended Regulation could be safely and feasibly implemented at

27 tanker terminals, and because no international maritime organization had sanctioned any

28
- 13 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

such systems for use with oil tankers, in January and February 2019 WSPA and other

2 industry stakeholders urged Respondents to consider adopting an alternative compliance

3 approach in which Respondents would review emissions profiles from tanker fleets and

4 terminals and assess the feasibility of shore-based and water-based alternative emissions

5 controls for terminals before imposing mandates for terminals to install control technology.

6 Under this suggested alternative approach, tanker fleets and terminals also would annually

7 report to Respondents data on vessel visits to the terminals.

8 C. Respondents Refuse to Conduct a Feasibility Study and Continue the

9 Rulemaking on the Draft Amended Regulation.

10 46. Respondents refused to conduct a feasibility study for the installation and

11 operation of emissions controls at tanker terminals, and refused to adopt industry's

12 proposed alternative compliance approach for tankers. Instead, Respondents continued

13 apace with the rulemaking on the Amended Regulation.

14 47. On January 16, 2019, CARB released its "2018/2019 Update to Inventory

15 for Ocean-Going Vessels: Methodology and Results" ("2018/2019 Inventory Update"),

16 which purported to update the existing 2014 emissions inventory with 2018 and 2019 data.

17 However, CARB's 2018/2019 Inventory Update used inaccurate data and assumptions that

18 resulted in dramatically overestimating emissions from tanker vessels, including:

19 ignoring the emissions impact of Tier III tankers and other low-emission

20 tankers likely to be calling on marine terminals by 2030, which would result in significantly

21 less emissions from vessels at berth at marine terminals than CARB estimated;

22 overestimating activities and pumping time of tankers at berth at marine

23 terminals, resulting in a significantly inflated emissions inventory for tankers;

24 applying inapplicable or unrepresentative data from the Ports of Los Angeles

25 and Long Beach to marine terminal operations, further significantly inflating CARB's

26 assumed emission inventory from marine terminals;

27

28
- 14 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

greatly overstating forecasts of future vessel traffic growth that significantly

2 exceed historical data and stakeholders' own forecasts for tanker traffic at real-world

3 marine terminals; and

4 overstating estimates of cancer risk in the Health Risk Assessment model

5 that make unrealistic assumptions about receptors living in the same place for 70 years.

6 48. On February 19, 2019, Respondents circulated a revised discussion draft of

7 the Amended Regulation and an updated draft tanker implementation schedule setting

8 compliance deadlines of 2027 for installation of tanker control systems at the Ports of Los
Angeles/Long Beach and 2029 for installation of tanker control systems at other marine

10 terminals.

11 49. The February 2019 revised discussion draft of the Amended Regulation

12 articulated staff's view that the Regulation should require CARB-approved emission

13 control strategy for every vessel visit, but allow exceptions for emergencies and "safety

14 events."

15 50. In the same February 2019 discussion draft, Respondents proposed that the

16 Amended Regulation require CARB to conduct an "interim evaluation" by 2023 of "the

17 status of at berth emission control technologies for Ro-Ros and tankers, progress in

18 installing the land-side infrastructure required to support at berth control systems, and the

19 suitability of the regulation's emissions baseline to reflect cleaner vessels calling California

20 by 2030." Respondents proposed that this evaluation be reported to the Board with advice

21 as to "whether there is a need to develop any amendments to the regulation in response."

22 51. On March 29, 2019, WSPA provided comments on Respondents' February

23 2019 discussion draft, pointing out again that serious safety concerns exist with attempting

24 to control oil tanker emissions because "no emission control technology currently identified

25 is feasible for tanker operations. See Exhibit D. Specifically, the interface between any

26 control strategy (barge-based emission capture, land-based emission capture or

27 electrification) and a tanker (in addition to the control device itself) have had no

28
- 15 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

certifications by safety and engineering standards organizations. For this reason, WSPA

2 noted that, "for safety reasons alone." oil tanker vessel visits at a tanker marine terminal

3 should be considered "safety events" and excepted from the requirement to employ an

4 emission control strategy.

5 52. WSPA also noted in its March 29 comment letter that the proposed

6 implementation deadlines for installation of tanker control systems at the Ports of Los

7 Angeles/Long Beach and other marine terminals failed to provide adequate time for

8 regulated parties to feasibly construct, permit and implement any compliant emission
9 control system, "[g]iven that no technology has been design[ed], demonstrated or certified

10 by an international authoritative body."

11 53. WSPA added in its March 29 comment letter that, while it agreed with the

12 need for an evaluation of available control technology and land-based infrastructure

13 challenges, the 2023 timing of the proposed "interim evaluation" would not give regulated
14 parties enough time to comply with the draft regulatory deadlines, should the "interim

15 evaluation" find that required control technology is not yet reasonably available or feasible

16 for use at tanker terminals. As it pointed out to Respondents, "WSPA does not believe the
17 timeline should require an entity to design infrastructure for a technology while the
18 technology is still in development."

19 54. In May 2019, Respondents released a further revised working draft of the
20 Amended Regulation, along with a summary of staff's "Cost Analysis Inputs and
21 Assumptions" for the Standardized Regulatory Impact Assessment ("SRIA") to be required
22 for the Amended Regulation, and Respondents' "Analysis of Potential Emission Reduction
23 Strategies by Port/Terminal/Berth For Crude and Product Tanker Vessels."

24 55. The May 2019 revised draft of the Amended Regulation continued to

25 assume the use of shore-based emission controls as the method of regulatory compliance

26 for tanker terminals, again without accompanying evidence that such controls had ever been

27 feasibly or safely utilized in real-world tanker terminal operation.

28
- 16 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

P 56. The May 2019 revised draft Amended Regulation also added a new section

2 providing for an "interim evaluation" of tanker control technology and landside

3 infrastructure construction status. Unlike the feasibility study urged by WSPA and others,

4 which would assess tanker control safety and technological feasibility before adopting

5 enforceable implementation deadlines, the "interim evaluation" would not be completed

6 until more than two years after the Amended Regulation would become effective. The

7 proposed "interim evaluation" would not require staff report to CARB until July 2023 and

8 provided no relief from the 2027 and 2029 compliance deadlines for tanker terminals to

9 install (yet unproven) control technology.

10 57. In comments submitted on May 30, 2019, WSPA noted that Respondents'

11 "Cost Analysis Inputs and Assumptions" document estimated unrealistically low tanker

12 terminal capital costs for installing land-based emission control equipment and

13 infrastructure to comply with the draft Amended Regulation (i.e., about $16.5 million per

14 berth), when the true capital costs of compliance were closer to $33.5-$43.5 million per

15 berth for Southern California port-based terminals, and $65-$75 million per berth for

16 Northern California marine terminals. WSPA also pointed out that these infrastructure

17 capital costs would not include significant operational costs for terminals with land-based

18 control systems, which were not addressed in Respondents' "Cost Analysis" document.

19 58. On June 14, 2019 and August 15, 2019, WSPA submitted further comments

20 on the May 2019 revised draft of the Amended Regulation. See Exhibits C. D. In those

21 comments, WSPA noted that Respondents still had failed to produce any evidence of the

22 real-world feasibility or safety of the type of land-based emission control system the revised

23 draft Amended Regulation would mandate for tanker terminals. WSPA added that

24 Respondents appeared to have made their feasibility decision for tanker controls based

25 entirely on a single shore-based emission control system that had only ever been used once

had never been 26 for demonstration purposes on a non-tanker vessel - and that the system

27 tested on or configured for tankers at berth in marine terminals.

28
- 17-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

- 59.

2 Based on this fact, WSPA noted in its June and August 2019 comment

3 letters that emission control infrastructure would require not only the previously-requested

4 feasibility study as a prerequisite, but also a much longer implementation timeline

5 addressing the unique infrastructure modifications that would be required at each terminal.

6 These considerations, WSPA pointed out, would make the 2027 and 2029 compliance

7 deadlines for tanker terminals unworkable, and also would involve implementation costs
that would far exceed those in Respondents' preliminary cost analysis.

8 60.

9 To address these concerns, WSPA again advised Respondents in the June

10 and August 2019 comments to reconsider industry's alternative compliance approach and

11 conduct a comprehensive feasibility study in lieu of promising an ineffective "Interim

12 Evaluation" while imposing mandatory emission control requirements for tanker terminals.

13 WSPA outlined recommended specific steps for conducting such: feasibility study,

14 including engaging key stakeholders and regulatory agencies, considering existing

15 international tanker safety regulations and the Marine Oil Terminal Engineering and

16 Maintenance Standards ("MOTEMS"), accounting for any site-specific considerations,

17 weighing cost effectiveness, and providing adequate timeframes for the completion of the

work.

18 61.

19 Despite these comments, Respondents refused to conduct any study on the

20 feasibility of tanker emission controls as part of the draft Amended Regulation, and rejected
industry's proposed alternative compliance approach.

21 D.

22 Initial Statement of Reasons and Draft Environmental Analysis for the
Proposed Amended Regulation.

23 62. On October 15, 2019, Respondents publicly released their official

24 rulemaking documents for the proposed Amended Regulation, including proposed

25 regulatory text for the Amended Regulation, an Initial Statement of Reasons ("ISOR"), and

26 an accompanying draft Environmental Analysis ("EA") (technically, an "Environmental

27 Impact Analysis" pursuant to CARB CEQA implementing regulations) purportedly

28 prepared pursuant to CEQA.
18 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

- 63. On December 3, 2019, WSPA submitted a comment letter on the proposed

2 Amended Regulation and ISOR (Exhibit D to this Petition). In the comment letter, WSPA

3 expressed its serious concerns, based on the weight of evidence in the rulemaking record,

4 that the proposed Amended Regulation was neither technologically feasible nor cost-

5 effective with respect to its regulation of tanker vessels.

6 64. WSPA further explained in the comment letter that, to date, Respondents

7 had failed to document - as required by California law that the tanker terminal provisions

8 of the proposed Amended Regulation were technologically feasible, cost effective,

9 necessary to attain ambient air quality standards, or designed to "minimize costs and

10 maximize the total benefits to California."

11 65. WSPA's December 3 comment letter pointed out that the proposed

12 Amended Regulation and ISOR failed to satisfy the minimum legal criteria in California

13 applicable to CARB rulemaking, including but not limited to the fact that the Amended

14 Regulation and ISOR:

15 produced no credible evidence that land-based capture and control systems

16 were safe or technologically feasible for real-world tankers or tanker terminals;

17 ignored documented feasibility and safety concerns associated with the

18 installation of massive land-based emission control infrastructure at marine terminals

19 without any existing emergency protocols for the types of connections required to tankers;

20 disregarded the complete lack of international or industry safety standards

21 for operation of land-based emissions controls on tankers during transfer of flammable and

22 explosive cargo;

23 failed to adequately address critical safety concerns raised by expert marine

24 operational and engineering consultants;

25 failed to justify the failure to mandate a feasibility study as a precondition to a

26 imposing control requirements on tanker terminals;

27

28
. 19 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

F imposed arbitrary and unattainable deadlines for tanker terminals to install

2 extensive emissions control infrastructure, at odds with the evidence submitted into the

3 rulemaking record of timeframes required in real-world terminal construction projects;

4 included "interim evaluation" provisions that did not substitute for a proper a
5 feasibility study, and provided no assurances of relief for regulated terminals from

6 unattainable emissions control installation deadlines;

7 relied on inaccurate emissions inventories containing outdated and incorrect

8 assumptions and methodology, including unrealistic predictions of future tanker visits and

9 emissions growth at odds with Respondents' own regulatory objectives to restrict fossil fuel

10 use in the state;

11 incorrectly assumed that no lower emitting Tier III marine vessels would be

12 in service in the state by 2030, without citing any supporting evidence for the claim;

13 exaggerated expected tanker pumping activity at berth by borrowing

14 pumping activity mode profiles from much larger vessels calling on the major ports, which

15 overstates estimated tanker pumping emissions in the inventory;

16 relied on an outdated and inapplicable methodology for estimating health
17 impacts from vessel marine engines, which overstated projected adverse health impacts;
18 claimed exaggerated cost savings from avoided premature deaths that are not

19 supported by the data;

20 systematically understated costs of compliance and overstated anticipated
21 emissions benefits from imposing emissions control requirements on tanker terminals; and
22 failed to discuss in the SRIA or elsewhere in the proposed rulemaking
23 documents the full range of potential negative impacts of the proposed Amended
24 Regulation on California commerce, competitiveness, or "leakage" of carbon emissions
25 from cargo diversion to other states.

26 66. WSPA's December 3 comment letter further noted that the Draft EA failed

27 to meet numerous requirements under CEQA, including:

28
- 20 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

F failing to fully and fairly consider environmental effects beyond air quality

2 and greenhouse gases;

3 setting compliance timelines that are "infeasible" as defined in CEQA;

4 abusing the tiering provisions of CEQA by overreliance on programmatic

5 analysis, and failing to utilize information already known to Respondents in the

6 environmental analysis;

7 incorrectly finding that construction and operational impacts to vessels

8 associated with hazards and hazardous materials would be less than significant;

9 failing to address numerous oil tanker feasibility and safety issues raised by

10 Woodbridge Marine, Inc., an independent marine consultant engineering firm specializing

11 in safety inspections on oil tanker vessels, including issues like electrostatic hazard,

12 handling inert gas in cargo tanks and exhaust stack pressure maintenance, emergency

13 disconnection, the need to develop equipment suitable for all tank vessel types that visit

14 California, safety standard certification and the need to consult standards organizations and

15 develop new standards for emission control system safety, and review for compliance with

16 MOTEMS;

17 erroneously rejecting impacts to fire protection services as insignificant;

18 incorrectly treating risks from wildfires as insignificant, and ignoring the
19 consequences of public safety power shutdowns and the need for backup systems;
20 insufficiently addressing potential impacts to biological resources in the
21 biologically rich coastal waters and wetland settings in which marine terminals are located;

22 ignoring the potential for significant land use plan conflicts;

23 failing to analyze relevant cumulative impacts by restricting the cumulative

24 analysis to projections of impacts from CARB's State Implementation Plan Strategy for

25 other air quality regulatory programs, rather than properly considering a list of coastal
26 construction projects producing related or cumulative impacts, or projections of coastal

27 development in planning documents that describe or evaluate conditions that could

-

2 contribute to cumulative effects together with infrastructure construction at marine

terminals;

3

4 failing to analyze reasonable alternatives to the proposed Amended

5 Regulation, including the alternative compliance proposals offered by industry; and

6 improperly framing project objectives so narrowly as to potentially preclude

7 alternatives allowing a reasonable and feasible period of time for compliance.

67.

8 WSPA urged Respondents to revise the Draft EA to address these issues and
to recirculate the revised draft for additional public comment.

9 E.

10 First Governing Board Hearing on Proposed Amended Regulation.

68.

11 On December 5, 2019, the CARB Governing Board held a public hearing to

12 receive staff's report on the proposed Amended Regulation. At that hearing, CARB staff

13 expansively claimed that health benefits of the proposed Amended Regulation would

14 outweigh the costs, yet neglected to mention that its estimates of future health benefits were

15 based on unrealistic assumptions about tanker emissions, future tanker visits and the likely
growth rate of the industry.
16 69.

17 At the December 5 hearing, CARB staff also incorrectly claimed that the

18 requirement to conduct a feasibility study for tanker terminal emissions controls was

19 fulfilled by a 2018 technology assessment and by the ISOR itself. But neither of these

20 documents referenced any real-world example of emission control or stack capture being

21 safely and successfully applied to tankers, nor did they present any analysis of how

22 emission controls would be designed to operate safely on tankers.

70.

23 In fact, in these documents CARB staff conceded that more tests and safety

24 studies need to be performed before attempting to use stack capture on tanker vessels,
regardless of site or location. In CARB staff's own words:
25

26 "Although these shore-based and barge-based emission control systems are

27 effective at reducing PM and NOX emissions on container vessels, more testing is needed

28 on other vessel types, including tankers, auto carriers, general cargo and bulk cargo."

2 CARB Draft Technology Assessment: Ocean-Going Vessels, May 2018, p. 72 (emphasis
added);

3

4 "Regardless of location, safety studies need to be performed to ensure all

5 safety considerations are met, given that the tanker vessels carry explosive cargos."

ISOR, p. III-22 (emphasis added),

6 71.

7 Also at the December 5, 2019 Board hearing, CARB staff incorrectly

8 asserted that "technology manufacturers have assured CARB staff that there are [emission

9 control] engineering solutions for both ro-ro and tanker vessels." While technology

10 providers may have represented to CARB staff that emission control systems have proven

11 feasible on vessels other than tankers. or that engineering solutions to enable controls on

12 tankers might be developed at some future date, the record contains no record of any

13 "technology manufacturer" ever representing to CARB staff that these solutions currently

14 exist and are in use at real-world tanker terminals. In fact, on April 16, 2019 during

15 CARB At Berth Working Session, a lead technology provider stated in a presentation that a

16 land-based emission control system faces a number of design challenges when applied to

17 any tanker vessel, including safety (a higher hazard level, need for safety standards and

18 procedures, emergency protocols) and ability to design and operate a larger and more
complex configuration.

19 72.

20 In the December : Board hearing, CARB staff also represented to the Board

21 that the 2023 "interim evaluation" provisions in the proposed Amended Regulation would

22 "address the uncertainty of the timelines [for installation of emission controls] for these
new vessel types." What staff failed to mention to the Board is that the "interim
23 evaluation" procedures provided for no actual relief to regulated terminals should the

24

25 evaluation show that emission control technologies are not immediately available or
feasible for tankers.

26 73.

27 Staff also advised the Board in the December 5 hearing that it would respond

28 to industry's request for an alternative compliance path by adding provisions to the

- 23 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

proposed Amended Regulation that would allow regulated parties to develop "innovative

2 concepts" for reducing emissions in an equivalent amount to those reductions from shore

3 power or emission control, but through projects other than installation of shore power or

4 emission control equipment. But in responses to questions from Board members, staff

5 made clear that the proposed "innovative concepts" provisions in fact would "not [be] in

6 lieu of ultimate regulatory compliance" with the shore power/emission control

7 requirements, as WSPA and other regulated parties had requested, but merely a temporary

8 measure regulated parties could choose to adopt until installing shore power or emission

9 control equipment. In this way, staff made clear that the "innovative concepts" path would

10 not be a real and permanent alternative to the shore power/emission control mandates,

11 which continued to pose intractable feasibility concerns for WSPA and other terminal

12 operators.

13 74. Throughout the December 5, 2019 CARB Board hearing, CARB staff made

14 numerous other inaccurate or unsupported claims to the Board about the purported need for,
15 feasibility and anticipated impact of mandating emission controls for tankers calling on

16 tanker terminals. WSPA included a list of these staff misrepresentations in its later May 1,
17 2020 comment letter on the proposed Amended Regulation.

18 75. At the conclusion of the December 5, 2019 CARB Board hearing, the Board
19 instructed staff to consider any additional modifications to the proposed Amended

20 Regulation that might be appropriate based on public comments and Board feedback, and to

21 release any revised version of the Regulation for public review and comment for a period of
22 at least 15 days. The Board also directed staff to (1) investigate how to prioritize the
23 "technology review" needed to assess feasibility for tankers, (2) investigate and explain
24 whether accelerating the existing proposed regulatory deadlines would be feasible, and

25 (3) to reassess whether the existing deadlines could be realistically achieved.

26 76. At no time in the December 5, 2019 Board hearing did the Board or any of
27 its members actually mandate CARB staff to "accelerate" any implementation dates for
28
- 24 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

marine terminals hosting tankers in the absence of any evidence to support the idea that

2 such "acceleration" was feasible.

3 77. On March 6, 2020, WSPA submitted additional comments on the proposed

4 Amended Regulation again expressing its serious concerns about the continued lack of

5 evidence that emission control infrastructure and equipment could be safely and feasibly

6 operated at tanker terminals. See Exhibit E. WSPA expressed its strong view that

7 Respondents not adopt a proposed Amended Regulation that could "create an unacceptable

8 risk of catastrophic explosion or other dangerous incident."

9 78. To that end, WSPA included in its March 6, 2020 comment letter a

10 recommended redline of the proposed Amended Regulation. The redline was designed to

11 incorporate the need for a feasibility study prior to the imposition of any deadlines for

12 tanker terminals, and add a true alternative compliance option that would enable tanker

13 terminals to pursue a feasible path to compliance in lieu of shore power or at-berth tanker

14 emission control that would still achieve equivalent emissions reductions to shore power or

15 emission control, while ensuring the health and safety of terminal workers and the

16 communities in which terminals operate.

17 79. WSPA emphasized in its March 6, 2020 comment letter that any emission

18 control strategy to be mandated for tanker vessels must first be demonstrated to be safe and

19 feasible for real-world operation at tanker terminals, taking into account the unique

20 explosive risks associated with tankers, the need to utilize boiler exhaust gas to maintain

21 non-explosive atmosphere in tanker cargo spaces, and the need to carefully manage

22 potential sources of ignition aboard tanker vessels from static electricity or other sources.

23 80. WSPA also advised in its March 6 comment letter that Respondents must

24 account for and discuss harmonization with existing international and industry tanker safety

25 standards, including but not limited to rules and guidelines issued by the United States

26 Coast Guard, marine classification societies, the Oil Companies International Marine

3 E. First 15-Day Changes and the Outbreak of COVID-19.

4 81. Within a few months after the December 2019 CARB Board hearing,

5 California and the world experienced the outbreak of the worst global pandemic in

6 generations. On January 25, 2020, California saw its first confirmed case of infection from

7 the COVID-19 novel coronavirus. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization

8 declared COVID-19 a public health emergency. By February 6, 2020, California had

9 experienced its first death from COVID-19, and by early March 2020, most major

10 California counties had declared local health emergencies.

11 82. On March 4, 2020, Governor Gavin Newsom declared a statewide state of

12 emergency, and on March 19, 2020, the Governor issued the nation's first statewide stay-at-
13 home order. The order had the effect of shutting down all California businesses and

14 industries except for those operating in 16 critical infrastructure sectors.

15 83. Since March 2020, California and the world have undergone the worst

16 economic collapse since the Great Depression. Unemployment rates in California exceeded

17 16% by April 2020. The United States gross domestic product fell nearly 33% in the

18 second quarter of 2020, rivaling only Depression-Era losses.

19 84. California's statewide stay-at-home orders and travel bans brought the
20 world's fifth largest economy to a virtual halt. Businesses throughout California were
21 forced to focus on survival, with many struggling just to keep their doors open.

22 85. Port and terminal activities were (and continue to be) significantly disrupted

23 by the COVID-19 pandemic. Numerous vessel visits to ports and terminals had to be

24 rescheduled or cancelled. Port and terminal personnel availability became severely

25 restricted. Capital infrastructure construction activities had to be delayed or scrapped,
26 while company resources were redirected to emergency response and support of efforts
27 designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

28
- 26 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

F 86. In the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, Respondents continued preparing

2 revisions to the proposed Amended Regulation that were ultimately released on March 26,

3 a 2020 for a mandatory minimum 15-day public review and comment period (the "First 15-

4 Day Changes").

5 87. The First 15-Day Changes did not propose any changes to staff's existing

6 projections for future vessel visits, economic activity, resulting emissions, cost

7 effectiveness, or other impacts as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Respondents also

8 did not propose any change to the existing rulemaking schedule as a result of the COVID-

9 19 pandemic.

10 88. In the First 15-Day Changes, Respondents proposed, among other things,

11 accelerating the emission control compliance dates for tankers visiting the Ports of Los

12 Angeles/Long Beach and all other ports and terminals from 2027 and 2029, respectively, to

13 2025 and 2027, respectively. Respondents pointed to no evidence supporting the view that

14 such acceleration was feasible or necessary to meet staff's articulated emissions goals, but

15 instead claimed that "[t]his change is proposed in direct response to CARB Board's request

16 at its December 5, 2019 meeting to accelerate implementation dates in order to achieve

17 earlier public health benefits from the regulation."

18 89. The First 15-Day Changes also proposed new "Innovative Concepts"

19 provisions purporting to give regulated entities a temporary compliance "alternative" to

20 installing shore power or at-berth emission controls, so long as overall emission reductions

21 from the "Innovative Concept" were achieved earlier than, and/or in equal amount to (or

22 greater than), emission reductions that would have been achieved at berth from shore power

23 or installation of emission controls.

- 90. On May 1, 2020, WSPA submitted comments on the First 15-Day Changes,

2 also attaching its March 6, 2020 comment letter and proposed regulatory redlines for

3 reference and review. See Exhibit E.

4 91. In its May comment letter, WSPA pointed out that the 15-Day Changes

5 completely ignored the COVID-19 pandemic and failed to account for any impacts to

6 Respondents' original baseline emissions, vessel visit or economic assumptions - despite

7 the fact that the pandemic had clearly and dramatically impacted the state's economy and

8 vessel visits to ports and marine terminals, and would continue to have repercussions for

9 years to come.

10 92. WSPA included in its May 1 comments an independent analysis by Capitol

11 Matrix Consulting ("CMC") describing the unprecedented global economic impacts of

12 COVID-19, and illustrating why Respondents' future vessel visit and emission projections,

13 projected benefits of the proposed Amended Regulation, the SRIA, and the updated

14 analysis of cost impacts relied upon in the First 15-Day Changes were all now outdated and

15 bore little relation to the state's current reality.

16 93. WSPA also noted in its May 1 comments that Respondents had provided no

17 evidentiary basis for accelerating the already-unrealistic deadlines for tanker compliance by

18 two years in the 15-Day Changes, and that such an unwarranted acceleration of compliance

19 deadlines would significantly increase costs and burdens for regulated tanker terminals, and

20 could very well create serious safety risks for tanker terminals. WSPA added that the

21 CARB Board never mandated staff to accelerate any compliance deadline, but only

22 investigate whether such acceleration would be feasible and appropriate. The Board did not

23 instruct staff to accelerate deadlines in the absence of any evidence that those accelerated
24 deadlines would be safe or feasible.

25 94. In the May 1 comments, WSPA also - once again - stated that a feasibility

26 study must first be conducted for tanker terminals to determine whether and how emission

27 controls could be safely and feasibly operated at tanker terminals, and again urged

28

-

2 Respondents to consider and adopt the proposed regulatory text redlines WSPA provided in

3 its March 6, 2020 comment letter. WSPA reiterated that the proposed "interim evaluation"

4 provisions were no substitute for a proper feasibility study, and provided no actual relief for

5 regulated parties should the "interim evaluation" eventually show that tanker terminal
controls were not feasible in the regulatory deadlines proposed.

6 95.

7 In its May comment letter, WSPA included several real-world examples of

8 catastrophic tanker explosions, fires and loss of life resulting from a failure to observe strict

9 safety measures in the management of vapors from tanker vessel cargo areas, and in the

10 careful prevention of sources of static electricity that could ignite a dangerous fire or

11 explosion. WSPA added that "[n]o international or industry group has done a feasibility

12 study to assess whether a shore-based capture and control system could be designed and

13 implemented for oil tankers in a manner that would not compromise integrated safety

14 systems, ship designs and procedures necessary to avoid the types of serious consequences
discussed above."

15 96.

16 In addition, WSPA's May 1 comment letter indicated that the proposed

17 "Innovative Concepts" provisions in the First 15-Day Changes did not provide a true

18 compliance alternative for regulated parties, since the provisions did not provide for a true

19 permanent substitute compliance path in lieu of installing yet-infeasible emission controls,

20 but only imposed a temporary additional obligation to the existing emission control

21 requirement, disincentivizing any regulated parties to actually choose to fund an
"Innovative Concept."

22 97.

23 Regarding CEQA compliance, WSPA and others stated that the Draft EA

24 must be revised and recirculated to analyze the environmental consequences of accelerated

25 compliance deadlines as required by CEQA including (a) the increased risk and potential

26 impacts at the facility, in the surrounding community, and to biological resources of a

27 hazardous incident - such as a fire, explosion, and/or oil spill - from early deployment of

28 untested technology on tanker vessels; (b) impacts to biological resources, including

• 29 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

-

2 wetlands, other sensitive habitats, special-status species and impacts associated with typical

3 seasonal work windows, resulting from the suite of construction projects along shorelines

4 that would be required to comply with the Amended Regulation; (c) increased cumulative

5 impacts, including to biological resources and other CEQA impact categories, from other

6 foreseeable coastal development projects or projections (and not just projections under

7 CARB's own rules), including overlapping construction projects and other development

8 within the newly compressed compliance timeframe; and (d) new or more severe

9 potentially significant impacts in a number of CEQA impact categories. Respondents again

10 ignored potentially significant impacts on the physical environment associated with the
accelerated - impossible to meet - schedule.

11 98.

12 In addition to WSPA's extensive comments, another stakeholder, in a letter

13 dated April 30, 2020, detailed numerous CEQA and other legal flaws with Respondents'

14 proposed Amended Regulation and 15-Day Changes, including (a) the technological

15 infeasibility of achieving either the original or accelerated compliance deadlines due to the

16 mandated use of as-yet unproven technology and the extensive amount of time needed to

17 address safety and design, engineering, environmental review, permitting and construction;

18 (b) the inadequate analysis of health and safety risks to people and the environment from

19 the required modification of crucially important safety systems for handling dangerous

20 flammable cargoes and the resulting increased risk of a catastrophic incident such as a fire

21 or explosion; (c) the cursory analysis of impacts to biological resources, including the

22 harmful effects on numerous special-status fish and wildlife species and sensitive habitats

23 that are not even mentioned let alone analyzed in the EA, resulting from shoreline

24 construction projects during compressed schedule and potential conflicts with seasonal

25 work restrictions designed to protect species; and (d) the insufficient analysis of cumulative

26 impacts from other past, present and reasonably foreseeable future projects involving in-

27 water and shoreline work, including specific projects that the commenter provided as
examples for including in the analysis.

2 In its May 1 comment letter, WSPA incorporated by reference these April
30, 2020 stakeholder comments, which are attached hereto at Exhibit E.

3 F. June 2020 Board Hearing and Second 15-Day Changes.

4 100.

5 On June 25, 2020, CARB staff appeared before the Board to provide an

6 informational update on the proposed Amended Regulation and First 15-Day Changes.

7 Staff confirmed in testimony that the marine tanker compliance deadlines were accelerated

8 in the First 15-Day Changes in direct response to Board direction from the December 2019

9 hearing, and mentioned no new evidence or data to support the idea that the accelerated

10 deadlines could actually be safely and feasibly achieved by tanker terminals. Instead,

11 CARB staff simply stated at the June 25 hearing that it was important to set "aggressive"
emissions reduction goals.

12 101.

13 Also during the June 25 hearing, CARB staff claimed that "we're already

14 starting to see increases in crude imports in May and June, and demand is expected to

15 continue recovering as more people resume normal daily operations." But Staff did not

16 present the data on which they purported to rely. Moreover, the subsequent resurgence of

17 COVID-19 cases in California by that time prompted the re-imposition of strict state and

18 local responsive measures, including widespread business closures, which have

19 dramatically affected, and will continue to affect, demand for petroleum and tanker vessel

visits in California.

20 102.

21 In addition, in the June 25 hearing CARB staff maintained its claim that

22 tanker vessels' share of overall PM2.5 emissions from ocean-going vessels is 50%, and

23 repeatedly cited this 50% number as an important basis for not adjusting compliance

24 timelines or other requirements for tanker vessels in the proposed Amended Regulation.

103.

25 On July 10, 2020, Respondents released a second set of changes to the

26 proposed Amended Regulation for 15-day public review and comment (the "Second 15-

27 Day Changes"). Among other things, the Second 15-Day Changes proposed extending

28 compliance start dates for container vessels, refrigerated cargo vessels, passenger vessels

- 31 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

-

2 and ro-ro vessels, but arbitrarily excluded tankers from any changes in the proposed

3 compliance schedule based on an unsupported claim that the tanker industry has somehow

4 "recovered" from the economic collapse related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

104.

5 The Second 15-Day Changes also proposed extending the maximum

6 "Innovative Concepts" compliance period from three years to five years, and made minor

7 changes to the "interim evaluation" provisions that continued to fail to provide for a proper
feasibility study for emission controls at tanker terminals.

8 105.

9 On July 27, 2020, WSPA submitted a comment letter on the Second 15-Day

10 Changes, noting that the denial of deadline relief to tanker terminals was arbitrary,

11 capricious and not supported by any credible evidence in the record that the tanker industry
has "recovered" from the COVID-19 downturn. See Exhibit F. To

12 the contrary, WSPA

13 provided additional data with its July 27 comment letter indicating that the crude exports
and imports, and tanker vessel visits, are still far below 2019

14 remain so a for a considerable period. averages and are likely to

15 106.

16 Based on these data, WSPA argued in its comment letter that tanker vessels

17 deserve at least the same relaxation in compliance start dates that staff was proposing for

18 container vessels, refrigerated cargo vessels and passenger vessels in the Second 15-Day
Changes.

19 107.

20 In its July 27 comment letter, WSPA repeated its call for Respondents to

21 conduct a feasibility study before adopting enforceable limits and regulatory deadlines for

22 tanker terminals to install yet-unproven emission control systems. WSPA listed in its letter

23 the multiple global safety requirements and best practices tankers are required to follow,

24 including the provisions of the ISGOTT, the California Building Code and the MOTEMS

25 standards it mandates, safety guidance from the American Bureau of Shipping ("ABS")

26 recognized by the U.S. Coast Guard, and tanker safety guidance from the IMO. WSPA

27 noted that the rulemaking record contained no evidence to date that staff had reviewed and

28
- 32 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

1 considered any of those requirements in arbitrarily setting compliance deadlines for tanker

2 terminals to install emission control equipment and infrastructure.

3 108. WSPA also pointed out in the July 27 comment letter that the proposal to

4 extending the maximum "Innovative Concepts" compliance period from three years to five

5 years did not make "Innovative Concepts" a viable compliance alternative for tanker

6 terminals.

7 109. WSPA also commented in the July 27 letter that the Second 15-Day Changes

8 continue to unrealistically assume zero changes to projected vessel visits, emissions or
9 economic activity as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, Respondents continued

10 to justify the proposed Amended Regulation with increasingly unrealistic and outdated

11 assumptions about future business levels, emissions and potential environmental benefits of

12 the proposed amendments.

13 110. Finally, in its July 27 comment letter WSPA indicated that Respondents had
14 only shared in early July 2020 the results of a study commissioned by Respondents in 2019
15 on real-world tanker emissions, entitled "Emissions Evaluation of a Large Capacity

16 Auxiliary Boiler on a Modern Tankers" and conducted by the University of California,
17 Riverside, Bourns College of Engineering Center for Environmental Research and
18 Technology ("CE-CERT Report"). WSPA noted that the CE-CERT Report was dated
19 March 2020, despite Respondents only disclosing the Report in July 2020 in response to a
20 specific WSPA request for an update on its status.

21 111. As WSPA pointed out in its July 27 comment letter, the CE-CERT Report
22 conducted observations of actual tanker operations in 2019 and 2020, and collected
23 empirical data on actual tanker boiler emissions of PM.25 and NOx. The CE-CERT Report
24 concluded that, based on these empirical data from real-world tankers, the average
25 emissions rate for NOx was 0.858 grams per kilowatt-hour, and the average emissions rate

26 for PM2.5 was just 0.0066 gram per kilowatt-hour.

27

28
- 33 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

P 112. These emissions numbers are dramatically lower than the obsolete emissions

2 factors relied upon by Respondents throughout the rulemaking on the Amended Regulation.

3 In fact, staff's estimates for NOx (1.995 grams per kilowatt-hour) and PM2.5 (0.151 gram

4 per kilowatt-hour) overstated the actual tanker boiler emissions reported by CE-CERT -

5 Respondents' own commissioned independent consultant - by 233% for NOx emissions

6 and 2,288% for PM2.5 emissions.

7 113. WSPA commented in its July 27 letter that Respondents had not even

8 publicly disclosed this data in the rulemaking to date, let alone discuss it and attempt to
explain its significance to the proposed Amended Regulation. This failure to acknowledge

10 and discuss directly relevant empirical data in Respondents' possession was arbitrary,

11 capricious, and violated Respondents' duties to properly and accurately consider the likely

12 benefits, cost effectiveness, projected emissions reductions, and resulting health and

13 environmental impacts of the proposed Amended Regulation.

14 114. Regardless of the conclusions to be drawn from the CE-CERT Report,

15 Respondents had a legal duty to disclose and discuss the Report's findings, and - if

16 necessary - delay finalizing the proposed Amended Regulation until the significance of the

17 Report is understood and publicly addressed.

18 G. Adoption of Final Amended Regulation.

19 115. On August 27, 2020, the CARB Board held a public hearing to review the

20 final Environmental Analysis ("Final EA") on the proposed Amended Regulation and

21 responses to public comments on the Final EA, and to approve the final version of the

22 proposed Amended Regulation. On that same day, WSPA presented its final comment

23 letter to Respondents on the final proposed Amended Regulation. See Exhibit G.

24 116. WSPA noted in its August 27 comment letter that the final version of the

25 proposed Amended Regulation presented for the Board's consideration failed to require a

26 feasibility study to evaluate whether and how emission control equipment and infrastructure

27

28
- 34 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

1 could be safely installed and operated at tanker terminals, nor did Respondents present any

2 evidence of safety or feasibility in practice for real-world tankers and tanker terminals.

3 117. WSPA commented that staff's failure to properly assess the safety or

4 feasibility of the proposed tanker emission control requirements meant that it had also

5 inadequately considered the negative health, safety, environmental and other impacts that

6 could flow from mandating yet-unproven emission control systems for tankers.

7 118. WSPA commented that staff's failure to properly conduct a feasibility study

8 for tankers also meant that the original 2027 and 2029 compliance deadlines for tanker

9 terminals had no meaningful evidentiary support in the record, and rendered the later

10 decision to accelerate these deadlines with no additional supporting evidence arbitrary and

11 capricious on its face.

12 119. WSPA commented that Respondents had still not yet conducted an adequate

13 environmental analysis as required by CEQA of the potential significant impacts from the

14 proposed Amended Regulation, including health and safety impacts from hazards and

15 hazardous materials, impacts to biological impacts and cumulative impacts.

16 120. The Final EA largely dismissed WSPA's comments and those of industry

17 experts, including that the industry's safety precautions and track record depend on

18 feasibility evaluations, international tanker safety standards not even considered by

19 Respondents, and other precautions for which the Amended Regulation does not allow

20 sufficient time to develop, design and implement. The Final EA failed to inform the public
21 and the decision-makers about the potential impacts resulting from the Amended

22 Regulation, including hazards and safety impacts from required modifications to essential

23 safety systems used by tanker vessels to manage flammable cargo during offloading and

24 interface with the vessels' exhaust systems.

25 121. The Final EA also dismissed WSPA's comments about the need to conduct a

26 more thorough impact analysis for biological resources, including the failure to adequately

27

28
- 35 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

F address harmful impacts to a number of special-status fish and wildlife species that were

2 specifically identified in comments submitted to Respondents months earlier, in April 2020.

3 122. The Final EA similarly dismissed WSPA's comments about the need to

4 conduct an adequate cumulative impact analysis, even though the comments submitted to

5 Respondents in April 2020 had presented specific examples of past, present and reasonably

6 foreseeable future projects that had the potential to impact the same sensitive biological

7 resources that would be adversely impacted by in-water and shoreline construction

8 activities required to comply with the Amended Regulation.

9 123. The Final EA compounded these CEQA deficiencies by creating new flaws.

10 For example, it casually disclosed that several new or more severe impacts were

11 "potentially significant and unavoidable," issues which were not discussed in the Draft EA.

12 124. But instead of recirculating the EA for additional public review as required

13 by CEQA Guidelines Section 15088.5, Respondents took the opposite approach and rushed

14 the Final EA to final certification, releasing the document only two days prior to the Board

15 hearing to consider final adoption of the Amended Regulation.

16 125. Respondents' flawed and inadequate CEQA analysis thus impaired the
17 ability of the public to participate meaningfully in the decision-making process and failed to

18 provide sufficient and accurate information to promote an informed decision by

19 Respondents on whether to adopt the Amended Regulation.

20 126. WSPA further commented that the "interim evaluation" provisions of the

21 proposed Amended Regulation provided no substitute a for a proper feasibility study, and

22 provided no guarantee of relief for regulated tanker terminals if that "interim evaluation"

23 determined that land-side emission controls were not safe or feasible for tankers or tanker

24 terminals.

25 127. WSPA commented that the final proposed Amended Regulation continued

26 to improperly ignore entirely any impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic on tankers and

27 tanker terminals, including impacts on projected future vessel visits, vessel emissions, the

28
36 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

-

2 economic health of the tanker industry, or tankers' ability to comply in the timeframes
mandated in the proposed Amended Regulation.

3 128.

4 WSPA commented that the "Innovative Concepts" provisions in the

5 proposed Amended Regulation do not provide a realistic and effective alternative to the

6 default at-berth emissions limit compliance deadlines for tankers, and therefore, do not

7 provide tanker terminals and ports relief from continuing feasibility concerns with proposed
control technologies and compliance deadlines.

8 129.

9 WSPA commented that the final version of the proposed Amended

10 Regulation continued to be based on inaccurate and overstated projections of future vessel

11 activity and resulting emissions, causing Respondents to systematically exaggerate the
anticipated benefits of the proposed Amended Regulation.

12 130.

13 WSPA commented that staff has relied on one particularly critical

14 inaccuracy in adopting proposed Amended Regulation, in that it failed to publicly disclose,

15 discuss or account for the empirical emissions results of the CE-CERT study, Respondents'

16 own commissioned independent study on tanker emissions, which indicated that tankers

17 emit dramatically lower levels of NOx and PM2.5 than staff had been assuming throughout

18 the rulemaking process, and upon which staff relied to project future tanker emissions,

19 anticipated reductions from the proposed Amended Regulation, and any resulting health

benefits.

20

21 131. Despite these and numerous other comments from regulated entities and

22 other stakeholders, the CARB Board unanimously adopted the Amended Regulation at the
August 27, 2020 hearing.

23

24 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

25 (Adoption of Amended Regulation Was Arbitrary, Capricious, Without Evidentiary

26 Support and/or Contrary to California Law)

132.

27 Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1-131, inclusive.

28
- 37 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

P 133. Before adopting an ATCM like the Amended Regulation, Respondents are

2 required to show that the proposed measure reduces emissions to levels that are "achievable

3 through application of best available control technology or a more effective control

4 method." Cal. Health & Safety Code ("HSC") § 39666(c).

5 134. Respondents have acted arbitrarily, capriciously and/or in violation of their

6 legal duties in adopting the Amended Regulation, in that, among other things, the

7 rulemaking record lacks substantial evidence to show that the required emissions standards

8 for tanker vessels are "achievable" through any currently available or feasible control

9 technology, and the available evidence in the record actually demonstrates the contrary.

10 135. Before adopting measures to control criteria air pollutants from mobile

11 sources, Respondents must show how the measure is necessary to attain ambient air quality

12 standards, cost-effective and technologically feasible. HSC § 43013(a), (c). As part of the

13 feasibility finding, Respondents must assess, "based on a preponderance of scientific and

14 engineering data in the record," the technological feasibility of the regulation, "includ[ing],

15 but [] not limited to, the availability, effectiveness, reliability and safety expected of the

16 proposed technology in an application that is representative of the proposed use." HSC

17 § 43013(e)(2). Respondents also must ensure that any rule they adopt "will result in the

18 most cost-effective combination of control measures on all classes of motor vehicles and

19 motor vehicle fuel." HSC § 43018(c).

20 136. Respondents have acted arbitrarily, capriciously and/or in violation of their

21 legal duties in adopting the Amended Regulation, in that, among other things, the

22 rulemaking record not only fails to evidence the feasibility of capture and control on tankers

23 at marine terminals in the proposed regulatory timeframes, but also ignores or understates

24 the costs of building infrastructure, fails to accurately assess the reliability concerns of

25 capture and control, and ignores or downplays the significant safety risks associated with

26 attempting to install capture and control technology for tankers at marine terminals.

27

137. Respondents have further acted arbitrarily, capriciously and/or in violation

2 of their legal duties in adopting the Amended Regulation, in that the administrative record

3 does not document that the Amended Regulation would result in the most cost-effective

4 combination of control measures on all classes of marine vessels and fuel at issue, since it

5 imposes disproportionately high infrastructure and implementation costs on the tankers

6 calling at marine terminals versus other classes of marine vessels subject to relatively more
7 cost-effective controls.

8 138. Respondents have further acted arbitrarily, capriciously and/or in violation

9 of their legal duties in adopting the Amended Regulation, in that the administrative record

10 does not document that the proposed provisions applicable to tankers and tanker terminals
11 are reasonably necessary to attain federal or state ambient air quality standards, and

12 systematically exaggerates future tanker emissions and anticipated future emissions benefits

13 related to control of tankers at berth in tanker terminals.

14 139. Before adopting regulations to reduce greenhouse gases, Respondents must
15 show that the proposed rule is technologically feasible and cost-effective, assess the

16 economic and noneconomic costs and benefits of the proposal on the economy and public
17 health (including potential adverse impacts on small businesses), consider the social costs

18 of the proposed GHG emissions levels, and show that the proposed reductions are real,

19 permanent, quantifiable, verifiable, and enforceable. Respondents also must consider the
20 relative contributions of different source categories to statewide GHG emissions. See HSC
21 §§ 38560 et seq.

22 140. Respondents have acted arbitrarily, capriciously and in violation of HSC
23 §§ 38560 et seq. in that, among other things, they have adopted capture and control

24 requirements for tankers that are not technologically feasible in the proposed regulatory
25 timeframes, not cost-effective, and will not achieve the emissions benefits CARB has

26 projected.

27

28
- 39 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

141. Respondents have further acted arbitrarily, capriciously and in violation of

2 HSC §§ 38560 et seq., in that the Amended Regulation fails to properly balance the relative

3 emission contribution from tankers against other mobile source categories throughout the

4 state, and unfairly penalizes terminals where tankers berth because of the extremely high

5 implementation costs associated with attempting to install capture and control technology at

6 these facilities.

7 142. Respondents are required by the California Administrative Procedure Act

8 ("*APA") to complete a written SRIA whenever a proposed regulation (like the Amended
Regulation) has an estimated economic impact over $50 million. See Cal. Gov. Code

10 11346.36; 1 C.C.R. §§ 2000-2004. The SRIA must adequately discuss the individuals

11 and business affected by the proposed regulation, the costs and benefits of the regulation,

12 the range of potential economic impacts, and a discussion of alternatives to the proposed

13 regulation identified by the public and the reasons for rejecting those alternatives. 1 C.C.R.

14 § 2002(b), (c); see also 1 C.C.R. § 2003(e) (comparison of alternatives to proposed

15 regulation.

16 143. Respondents have acted arbitrarily, capriciously and in violation of Cal.

17 Gov. Code § 11346.36 and/or C.C.R. §g 2000-2004, in that, among other things, the

18 SRIA for the Amended Regulation fails to discuss the full range of costs to be borne by

19 marine terminal and tanker operators, and does not adequately analyze the alternatives

20 presented by WSPA and other stakeholders of (a) first conducting a feasibility study before

21 setting enforceable deadlines for adoption of tanker capture and control infrastructure at

22 marine terminals; or (b) adopting some form of the suggested alternative regulatory redline

23 WSPA provided to Respondents.

24 144. Respondents have further acted arbitrarily, capriciously and in violation of

25 § Cal. Gov. Code $ 11346.36 and/or 1 C.C.R. §§ 2000-2004, in that Respondents improperly

26 rejected WSPA's proposed alternative compliance path to allow regulated tanker terminals
27

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

to achieve equivalent emissions reductions through means other than installing and

2 operating tanker emission control equipment.

3 145. California law also requires a SRIA to use an economic impact approach that

4 adequately considers creation or elimination of jobs and businesses within the state; the

5 competitive advantages or disadvantages for existing businesses; the increase Or decrease

6 of investment in the state; the incentives for innovation in products, materials, or processes;

7 and the proposed benefits of the regulation to health, safety, welfare, worker safety, and the

8 environment and quality of life in the state. 1 C.C.R. § 2003.
9 146. Respondents have acted arbitrarily, capriciously and in violation of 1 C.C.R.
10 § 2003, in that, among other things, the SRIA for the Amended Regulation fails to

11 adequately discuss the potential for the Amended Regulation to make regulated California

12 marine terminals less competitive for tanker traffic to the Pacific Coast, or the potential

13 negative impact on investment in and growth of California marine terminals serving
14 tankers, and on jobs at such marine terminals.

15 147. Respondents have further acted arbitrarily, capriciously and in violation of 1
16 C.C.R. § 2003, in that the SRIA relies on an unrealistic and over-optimistic view of future
17 port growth, which led to an exaggeration of anticipated emissions benefits from the

18 Amended Regulation.

19 148. Other than the relief sought herein, Petitioner lacks any plain, speedy, or
20 adequate remedy at law, and Petitioner's interests will be irreparably harmed if the
21 Amended Regulation goes into effect.

22 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Violation of CEQA, Pub. Res. Code § 21000, et seq.)
24 149. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1-148, inclusive.
25 150. CEQA was enacted, among other reasons, to (1) inform the public and
26 government agencies about a proposed activity's potential environmental impacts; and
27 (2) disclose to the public the rationale for approval of a project that may significantly

2 impact the environment. CEQA "embodies a central state policy to require state and local

3 governmental entities to perform their duties" under CEQA, including for projects

4 undertaken by the agency itself. Union of Med. Marijuana Patients, Inc. V. City of San
7 Diego (2019) 7 Cal.5th 1171, 1184-85.

5

6 151. Respondents conduct environmental review for projects that involve the

7 amendment of regulations, such as the Amended Regulation, pursuant to CEQA, the CEQA

8 Guidelines, and CARB's CEQA implementation regulations (17 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 60000-

9 60007). Respondents also are subject to specific requirements relevant here: before

10 adopting a regulation that requires installation of pollution control equipment or compliance

11 with performance standards or treatment requirements, Respondents must (i) identify

12 reasonably foreseeable methods of compliance; and (ii) analyze reasonably foreseeable

13 environmental impacts of, mitigation measures for, and alternatives to, the reasonably

14 foreseeable methods of compliance. CEQA §§ 21159(a), 21159.4. The environmental

15 analysis must take into account a reasonable range of environmental, economic and

16 technical factors, populations and geographic areas, and specific sites. CEQA § 21159(c).

152.

17 In addition, CARB's implementation regulations provide, among other

18 things, requirements for notice and conduct of meetings or hearings, preparation of staff

19 reports (or Initial Statements of Reasons ["ISOR"]) in a manner "consistent with the

20 environmental protection purposes of the state board's regulatory program and with the

21 goals and policies of [CEQA]," and public participation requirements. A staff report or

22 ISOR for a proposed regulation must include an environmental impact analysis if the

23 regulation or other state action is a non-exempt "project" (17 C.C.R. §§ 60004(b),(c),
60004.2; CEQA Guidelines § 15378).

24 153.

25 A draft environmental impact analysis functions as a substitute for

26 traditional CEQA environmental impact report under CARB's certified regulatory program.

27 Nevertheless, a draft environmental impact analysis must be prepared in accordance with

28 substantive requirements of CEQA (see, e.g., CEQA § 21080.5); CEQA Guidelines

- 42 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

§§ 15250-15253; and CARB's implementation regulations (see, e.g., 17 C.C.R.

2 §§ 60004(b), 60004.2 [contents of Draft and Final Environmental Impact Analyses; public

3 review period; consideration and certification of Final Environmental Impact Analysis and

4 project approval; notice of decision; and Executive Officer authority]).

5 154. As alleged herein, on December 3, 2019 and in subsequent comments prior

6 to final adoption of the Amended Regulation, WSPA identified numerous deficiencies in

7 the Draft and Final EA for the Amended Regulation. WSPA further commented that

8 correcting the deficiencies in the Draft EA would entail the addition of significant new

9 information, disclosing new or substantially more severe environmental impacts, thereby

10 triggering the requirement of recirculation under CEQA Guidelines § 15088.5 for additional

11 public disclosure and comment. Id. The Final EA remains deficient on numerous grounds

12 including:

13 Respondents failed to undertake a full and fair evaluation of the Amended

14 Regulation's potential to result in adverse environmental effects (beyond air quality and

15 greenhouse gases) as required by POET LLC v. State Air Resources Board (2012) 218

16 Cal.App.4th 681;

17 • Compliance deadlines for tanker terminals were unreasonable and infeasible

18 not "capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within an reasonable period of

19 time" (CEQA Guidelines § 15364) - based on technological factors (time to develop new

20 technology and address safety issues), legal factors (lead time for construction project

21 review and permitting), environmental factors (CEQA process for impacts to biological

22 resources, sensitive aquatic habitats), and high-cost and low-efficiency factors;

23 The Final EA failed to comply with the requirements a for a programmatic

24 level of analysis, by deferring analysis of reasonably foreseeable significant environmental

25 a effects to a later date and neglecting actual issues ripe for decision at the programmatic

26 level. CEQA Guidelines § 15152(b). The Final EA failed to provide a genuine

27 environmental review for the majority of impact areas (aesthetics, agricultural, construction

28
. 43 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

air emissions, biological resources, cultural resources, geological risk, hazards and

2 hazardous materials, hydrology, mineral resources, noise, traffic, and utilities impacts) in

3 violation of CEQA Guidelines 15152(b) (see also Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible

4 Growth, Inc. V. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 431; CEQA § 21159(c)), by

5 dismissing the impacts as too speculative for analysis at the programmatic level,

6 notwithstanding the information Respondents themselves placed in the rulemaking record

7 regarding identified projects and site-specific analysis as well as information submitted for

8 the record by commenters;

9 Based on the Final EA's programmatic approach and erroneous emission

10 reduction assumptions, the record overstated purported project benefits, deferred analysis of

11 impacts and mitigation measures, and did not support significant and unavoidable findings

12 and findings of overriding considerations with substantial evidence (CEQA Guidelines

13 § 15091; 17 C.C.R. § 60004.2(a)(3));

14 Prior to safety studies, the categorical dismissal of long-term vessel-based

15 operational safety hazard impacts (such as the risk of explosion) as less than significant was

16 erroneous and/or premature where safety protocols and standards do not yet exist. The

17 Final EA understated and/or failed to evaluate hazards and safety risks, and mitigation

18 mneasures were improperly deferred (CEQA Guidelines § 15126.4(a)(1)(B));

19 In the discussion of land-based long-term operational-related impacts to

20 hazards and hazardous materials, including impacts from operation of "modifications to

21 berths to provide shore-side capture and control devices and barge-based systems," the

22 Final EA added more than five pages of significant new information on potential impacts

23 related to hazard and safety risks. The addition of this new information, demonstrating

24 substantially more severe land-based operational hazard impacts, triggered an obligation to

25 revised and recirculate the EA for additional public comment, but Respondents did not do

26 so. Further, even with the additional text, the Final EA does not adequately describe how

27

28
- 44 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

and the extent to which the Amended Regulation would increase hazard and safety risks as

2 compared to the existing baseline conditions;

3 The Final EA, acknowledging the uncertainties of future mitigation and

4 conditions to be imposed by other agencies, concluded that many impacts - including land-

5 based long-term operational hazard impacts - are potentially significant and unavoidable at the
6 programmatic level of analysis. In the discussion of vessel-based long-term operational-

7 related impacts to hazards and hazardous materials, the Final EA similarly found that "it is

8 not possible to determine what safety regulations would govern new vessel technologies."

9 However, the Final EA reached the unsupported and inconsistent conclusion that, even at the

10 programmatic level, these unknown future regulations would suffice to address any previously

11 unidentifiable safety hazards and ensure that vessel-based long-term operational-related

12 impacts to hazards and hazardous materials were less than significant; and

13 The Final EA erroneously rejected impacts to fire protection services as

14 insignificant (based on population projections not hazard risk); ignored wildfire risks and

15 public safety power shutdowns; provided only cursory discussion of impacts to biological

16 resources (disregarding the vast majority of sensitive species and biological resources found

17 in the coastal setting in which marine terminals are located and naming only two bird

18 species, but not taking into account migrating and breeding fish or marine mammals and

19 their protected breeding seasons); ignored the potential for significant land use conflicts

20 with Local Coastal Programs, General and Specific Plans, and regional plans, such as the

21 San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission's Bay Plan and

22 environmentally protective provisions and policies therein; and failed to analyze relevant
23 cumulative impacts by using the "projections" method, but relying on the incomparable

24 analysis of projections for the 2016 State Implementation Plan air quality analysis, rather

25 than analyzing impacts from projections or a list of projects whose effects could combine

26 with the impacts of the Amended Regulation (CEQA Guidelines § 15065, 17 C.C.R.

27

28
- 45 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

- § 60004.2(a)(5)). Respondents thus failed to follow the CEQA mandate to consider the full

2 range of adverse environmental side-effects of the rulemaking.

3 155. The Final EA also failed to consider a reasonable range of alternatives.

4 CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6, 17 CCR § 60004.2(a)(5). Specifically, the Draft EA failed to

5 consider or even mention the "Alternative Proposal for Amendments to At-Berth

6 Regulations," which would require feasibility and cost effectiveness studies, proposed by

7 an industry coalition submitted by letter dated February 15, 2019. While the Final EA

8 added the "Industry Coalition Alternative" as an alternative considered but rejected, it

9 provided only a cursory and conclusory analysis. In particular, the Final EA rejected the

10 Industry Coalition Alternative" by claiming that allowing additional time for feasibility and

11 cost effectiveness studies would be inconsistent with CARB's objective to "assist in

12 achieving attainment of health-based federal national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS)

13 over the next 15 years", in violation of CEQA's prohibition on framing objectives so

14 narrowly as to preclude reasonable and feasible alternatives to the proposed project. In re

15 Bay-Delta Programmatic Environmental Impact Report Coordinated Proceedings (2008)

16 43 Cal.4th 1143, 1166.

17 156. WSPA, through representatives, testified at CARB's public hearings and

18 reiterated the deficiencies with the Draft and Final EA. Following the December 5, 2019

19 hearing, the CARB Governing Board adopted Resolution 19-28 directing the Executive

20 Officer, in part, to evaluate all comments received during the public comment periods,

21 including comments on the Draft EA, and to prepare written responses to EA comments as

22 required by CARB's certified regulations and Government Code § 11346.9(a).

23 157. After two rounds of 15-day changes, and WSPA comments thereon,

24 Respondents continued to reject commenters' requests for the agency to conduct an

25 adequate and thorough environmental review. On August 25, 2020, two days prior to the

26 adoption hearing, Respondents posted the Final EA and Response to EA Comments on the

27 agency's rulemaking webpage. Respondents characterized changes in the Final EA as

28
- 46 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

"minor revisions" (Resolution, p. 4). That was inaccurate and the truncated review period -

2 combined with the numerous flaws in the analysis and the failure to recirculate the EA for

3 additional public review and comment - deprived the public of a meaningful opportunity to

4 participate in the decision-making process. Respondents ultimately adopted CEQA

5 Findings and a Statement of Overring Considerations (Resolution, Attachment A) that

6 failed to address commenters' concerns and that were unsupported by the record.

7 158. Respondents failed to correct deficiencies in the Final EA. In response to

8 WSPA's objection to the cumulative impact analysis considering only the impacts of

9 CARB's own regulations in its State Implementation Plan ("SIP") strategy - and not the

10 types of coastal construction projects that would affect the same resources as the Amended

11 Regulation compliance projects, such as projections of cumulative shoreline construction

12 projects - Respondents' only explanation is that the SIP document is an appropriate option

13 for the analysis because the Amended Regulation's primary objective is to reduce pollutant

14 emissions from vessel engines. This is inadequate under CEQA. Under CEQA's

15 requirement to study cumulative effects, Respondents must evaluate potentially significant

16 impacts which may result from the combination of the proposed project (here, the adoption

17 of the Amended Regulation) together with other past, present and probable future projects

18 "causing related impacts." CEQA Guidelines § 15130(a)(1); see also CEQA Guidelines

19 con 15065, 17 C.C.R. § 60004.2(a)(4). When using the projections method, Respondents are

20 required to consider a "summary of projections contained in an adopted local, regional or

21 statewide plan or other related planning document that describes or evaluates conditions

22 contributing to the cumulative effect." CEQA Guidelines 15130(b)(1)(B) (emphasis

23 added). By relying instead on projections for the SIP Strategy, Respondents' approach to

24 cumulative impact analysis failed to comply with these requirements.

25 159. Respondents misconstrued the fundamental purpose of a cumulative impact
26 analysis under CEQA, which is to evaluate the "impact which is created as a result of the

27 combination of the project evaluated together with other projects causing related

28
- 47 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

I impacts." CEQA Guidelines § 15130(a)(1) (emphasis added). The "related impacts" here
2 are the potentially significant construction impacts to biological resources, regardless of the

3 purpose of the Amended Regulation in addressing a different environmental issue (air

4 emissions). Respondents ignored the specific types of projects that have been raised in the

5 comments as "causing related impacts" to sensitive biological resources, by artificially

6 relying on a set of air quality measures that may not cause these related impacts.

7 Respondents also failed to assess how the accelerated compliance actions under the

8 Amended Regulation's deadlines would combine with "other projects" (i.e., that are not "in

9 response to the Proposed Regulation") to cause "related impacts" (e.g., impacts on

10 biological resources).

11 160. Respondents also failed to comply with CEQA recirculation requirements.
12 CEQA requires that an environmental review document be recirculated whenever the public
13 agency adds significant new information after the close of the public comment period.
14 CEQA Guidelines § 15088.5. As summarized in WSPA's May 1 comment letter:
15 CARB staff must revise and recirculate the Draft EA to evaluate the

16 heightened hazards and impacts to biological resources resulting from the Proposed Regulation and the 15-Day Changes accelerating the already-
17 unrealistic compliance deadlines, and to conduct a proper project-specific and cumulative analysis of all categories of impacts caused by construction
18 activities associated with the Proposed Regulation together with impacts on

19 the same resources from construction of other, unrelated cumulative projects. These are serious omissions of crucial impact analyses required by
20 CEQA, which must be disclosed in a recirculated Draft EA and on which stakcholders are entitled to comment, before CARB may adopt the Proposed
21 Regulation. Id. at p. 14 (Exhibit E to this E Petition).

22 161. Respondents violated CEQA by failing to recirculate the EA after adding

23 significant new information, including information associated with the risk of explosion

24 during off-loading and risks to biological resources. Because this new information

25 suggested new, significant impacts not previously analyzed (or substantially more severe
26 environmental impacts), Respondents were required to analyze these impacts and

27 recirculate its analysis for public review. CEQA Guidelines § 15088.5. Respondents failed

28
48 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

to do so, and therefore prejudicially abused their discretion and failed to proceed in the

2 manner required by law, in violation of CEQA. For the same reasons, Respondents'

3 decision not to recirculate the EA was not supported by substantial evidence in the

4 administrative record.

5 162. Finally, Respondents adopted CEQA Findings and a Statement of

6 Overriding Considerations that are not supported by substantial evidence in the record

7 and/or are deficient. For example, Respondents again state that the applicable plan

8 containing projections for considering cumulative impacts is the 2016 State SIP Strategy.
Respondents' Statement of Overriding Consideration is based on overstated and inaccurate

10 emissions estimates and, accordingly, is unsubstantiated.

11 163. The foregoing paragraphs provide illustrative but not exhaustive examples of

12 the CEQA defects in Respondents' Final EA and its Findings and Statement of Overriding

13 Considerations.

14 164. As a result of these defects, Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of

15 discretion, failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and failed to support their

16 actions and approvals, including certification of the Final EA, with substantial evidence,

17 rendering such certification and the Amended Regulation null and void.

18 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

19 (Declaratory Relief)

20 165. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1-164, inclusive.

21 166. With respect to the violations of law alleged in the First and Second Causes

22 of Action, there exists a clear and actual controversy between Petitioner and Respondents

23 regarding Respondents' failures to comply with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines and CEQA

24 implementing regulations, and the sections of the California Health and Safety Code and

25 the California Government Code listed herein. Petitioner contends that Respondents have

26 not complied with these legal requirements, and that Respondents have taken actions that

27 are arbitrary, capricious, without evidentiary support and/or in violation of their legal

28
- 49 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT; CEQA CLAIM 4835-0732-3595

F duties. Respondents contend that they have complied with these requirements and have not

2 taken actions that are arbitrary, capricious, without evidentiary support and/or in violation

3 of their legal duties.

4 167. To remedy these violations of law, Petitioner requests a declaration of the

5 duties of Respondents under the legal authorities listed above.

6 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
(Injunctive Relief) A

8 168. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1-167, inclusive.
9 169. With respect to the violations of law alleged herein, Petitioner is entitled to
10 the relief demanded, which includes vacating and setting aside Respondents' approval of
11 the Amended Regulation.
12 170. Other than the relief sought herein, Petitioner does not have a plain, speedy,
13 or adequate remedy at law, and will suffer irreparable injury unless this Court grants the
14 requested writ of mandate and injunctive relief. As alleged herein, WSPA has a special
15 interest in the safety of personnel responsible for working closely with tankers at berth.
16 The safety and well-being of port and terminal workers would be placed at risk, without a
17 decision in WSPA's favor in this action. WSPA seeks to ensure that Respondents take into
18 account the evidence in the rulemaking record of the real-world risks, impacts and costs of
19 the Amended Regulation, and that the public and Respondents' decision-makers have all
20 environmental information required under CEQA and other necessary information. On
21 information and belief, Respondents, on the other hand, will not suffer any harm.
22 171. Petitioner is therefore entitled to a permanent injunction pursuant to Sections
23 525-526 of the Code of Civil Procedure commanding Respondents to cease violating the
24 legal requirements as alleged herein, to set aside and cease implementation and
25 enforcement of the Amended Regulation, and to follow all required legal processes with
26 respect to further action on the Amended Regulation, if any.
