23 STATUTORY FRAMEWORK

24 California Environmental Quality Act

25 11. CEQA requires state and local agencies to identify the potentially significant

26 environmental impacts of their actions, and then to avoid or mitigate those impacts if feasible.

27 12. CEQA requires agencies to analyze the potential environmental impacts of its proposed

28 actions in an environmental impact report (except in certain limited circumstances). The EIR is the very
heart of CEQA. Dunn-Edwards v. BAAQMD (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 644, 652. "The 'foremost principle'
-4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act to be read so as to afford the fullest

2 possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." Cmtys.

3 for a Better Env't v. Cal. Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.
13. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers and
4 the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. (14 Cal. Code of
5 Regulations ("CCR") § 15002, subd. (a)(1).)' "Its purpose is to inform the public and its responsible
6 officials of the environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR
7 *protects not only the environment but also informed self-government."" (Citizens of Goleta Valley v.

8 Bd. of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.) The EIR has been described as "an environmental "alarm

Q bell' whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before

10 they have reached ecological points of no return." (Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay v. Bd. of Port

11 Comrs. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1354.)
14. Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage when
12 "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all feasible mitigation measures.
13 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15002, subd. (a)(2) and (3); Citizens of Goleta Valley, supra, 52 Cal.3d at 564.)
14 The EIR serves to provide agencies and the public with information about the environmental impacts of
15 a proposed project and to "identify ways that environmental damage can be avoided or significantly
16 reduced." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15002, subd. (a)(2).)

17 15. To achieve its objectives of environmental protection, CEQA has a three-tiered

18 structure. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15002, subd. (k); Comm. to Save the Hollywoodland Specific

19 Plan V. City of Los Angeles (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1185 - 86.) First, if a project falls into

20 an exempt category, or it can be seen with certainty that the activity in question will not have a
significant effect on the environment, no further agency evaluation is required. (Id.) Second, if
21 there is possibility the project will have: significant effect on the environment, the agency
22 must perform a threshold initial study. (Id.; CEQA Guidelines, § 15063 subd. (a).) If the study
23 indicates that there is no substantial evidence that the project may cause a significant effect on
24 the environment the agency may issue a negative declaration. (Id., CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15063,

25

26 CCR sections 15000 et seq. are referred to herein as the "CEQA Guidelines." The CEQA Guidelines, codified in Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations, sections 15000 et seq, are regulatory
27 guidelines promulgated by the state Natural Resources Agency for the implementation of CEQA. (PRC $ 21083.) The CEQA Guidelines are given "great weight in interpreting CEQA except when .. clearly 28 unauthorized or erroneous." (Center for Biological Diversity v. Department of Fish & Wildlife (2015) 62 Cal. 4th 204, 217.) -5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

subd. (b)(2), 15070.) Finally, if the project will have a significant effect on the environment, an

2 environmental impact report ("EIR") is required. (Id.)
Environmental Impact Reports & The Substantial Evidence Standard
3 16. The California Environmental Quality Act, PRC §§ 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"),
4 requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its proposed actions in an
5 EIR (except in certain limited circumstances. (See, e.g., PRC § 21100.)
6 17. The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. (Dunn-Edwards v. BAAQMD (1992) 9

7 Cal.App.4th 644, 652.) "*The 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature

8 intended the act to be read so as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment

9 within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." (Cmtys. for a Better Env't v. Cal.

10 Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.)
18.
11 A lead agency may not approve a project if that project will have a significant
effect on the environment unless it has first adopted all feasible mitigation measures to eliminate
12 or substantially lessen all significant impacts of the project. (PRC § 21002.1(a), (b).)
13 19. CEQA also disallows approval of a project that fails to comply with other laws. A
14 lead agency may not approve a project with significant unavoidable impacts unless it is
15 "otherwise permissible under applicable laws and regulations." (PRC $21002.1(c).)

16 20. If the project will have a significant effect on the environment, the agency may

17 approve it the project only if it finds that it has "eliminated or substantially lessened all significant

18 effects on the environment where feasible" and that any unavoidable significant effects on the

19 environment are "acceptable due to overriding concerns." (PRC § 21081; CEQA Guidelines §
15092(b)(2)(A) & (B).)
20 21. While the courts review an EIR using an "abuse of discretion" standard, "the
21 reviewing court is not to *uncritically rely on every study or analysis presented by a project
22 proponent in support of its position. A clearly inadequate or unsupported study is entitled to no
23 judicial deference.'* (Berkeley Jets, supra, 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1355, [quoting Laurel Heights
24 Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of University of Cal. (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 391 409, fn. 12].)

25 Drawing this line and determining whether the EIR complies with CFQA's information

26 disclosure requirements presents a question of law subject to independent review by the courts.

27 (Sierra Club v. Cnty. of Fresno (2018) 6 Cal. 5th 502, 515; Madera Oversight Coalition, Inc. v.

28 County of Madera (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 48, 102, 131.)
22. When challenging an agency's certification of an EIR under CEQA, abuse of
-6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

F discretion is established if the agency: (1) has not proceeded in a manner required by law, or (2)

2 if the determination or decision is not supported by substantial evidence. (PRC § 21168.5.)
Substantial evidence is defined as "enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from 3 this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion, even though other
4 conclusions might also be reached."(CEQA Guidelines § 15384(a).) Substantial evidence
5 includes facts, reasonable assumptions predicated on facts, and expert opinion supported by
6 facts; however, it does not include argument, speculation, or unsubstantiated opinion or
7 narrative. (PRC §§ 21080(e), 21082.2(c).)

8 The EIR Project Description and Project Baseline

9 23. Under CEQA, "[a]n accurate, stable, and finite project description is the Sine qua

10 non of an informative and legally sufficient EIR." (County of Inyo V. City of Los Angeles (1977)
affected outsiders 11 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 193.) "Only through an accurate view of the project may

12 and public decision-makers balance the proposal's benefit against its environmental cost,
consider mitigation measures, assess the advantage of terminating the proposal (i.e., the 'no
13 project' alternative) and weigh other alternatives in the balance." (Id. at 192-93.)
14 24. In order for an EIR to accurately assess the degree of significance of a proposed
15 project's environmental effects, it normally must evaluate those effects against a "baseline" of
16 environmental conditions as they exist at the time of the Notice of Preparation (NOP) for the EIR

17 in question. (CEQA Guidelines §§ 15125 (a)(1), 15126.2(a).)

18 25. In general, "CEQA requires an EIR to 'focus on impacts to the existing

19 environment, not hypothetical situations," and thus "the impacts of a proposed project are
ordinarily to be compared to the actual environmental conditions existing at the time of CEQA 20 analysis." (San Franciscans for Livable Neighborhoods v. City and County of San Francisco 21 (2015) 26 Cal.App.5th 596, 614 615 [quoting County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water
22 Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 955 and Communities for a Better Envt. v. SCAAQMD
23 (2010) 48 Cal.4th 310, 321, 323]; see also Neighbors for Smart Rail v. Exposition Metro Line
24 Construction Authority (2013) 57 Cal.4th 439, 448.)

25 26. An agency may only use baseline of previously existing, historic conditions

26 where existing conditions have changed or fluctuated over time, and even then, only if an

27 historic conditions baseline is "necessary to provide the most accurate picture practically

28 possible of the project's impacts" and is supported by substantial evidence. (Guidelines, § 15125,
subd. (a)(1).) Thus, an agency may depart from the "existing conditions" baseline under CEQA
-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

only where "factual circumstances" justify this and "when necessary to prevent misinforming or

2 misleading the public and decision makers." (Neighbors for Smart Rail, supra, 57 Cal.4th at p.
448.) The rationale for this rule is that "an inappropriate baseline may skew the environmental 3 analysis flowing from it, resulting in an EIR that fails to comply with CEQA." (Citizens for East
4 Shore Parks v. State Lands Com. (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 549, 557.)
5 An EIR is Required to Consider a Reasonable Range of Alternatives
6 27. An EIR should describe a "range of reasonable alternatives to the Project, or to
7 the location of the Project, which would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the Project
8 but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the Project and evaluate

9 the comparative merits of the alternatives.' (CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6(a), (f), Citizens of

10 Goleta Valley v. Bd. Of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.)
28.
11 The EIR's alternatives discussion must "focus on alternatives to the project or its
location which are capable of avoiding or substantially lessening any significant effects of the 12 if these alternatives would impede to some degree the attainment of the project project, even
13 objectives or would be more costly." (CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6(b).)
14 29. The EIR must also include "sufficient information about each alternative to allow
15 meaningful evaluation, analysis, and comparison with the proposed project." CEQA Guidelines §
16 15126.6(d). The EIR must also discuss the lead agency's reasoning for selecting the alternatives

17 to be discussed in detail, and the reasons for rejecting other alternatives as infeasible. (CEQA

18 Guidelines § 15126.6(a), (c).)
30. 19 CEQA defines "feasible" as "capable of being accomplished in a successful
manner within a reasonable period of time, taking into account economic, environmental, social, 20 and technological factors," including but not limited to site suitability, economic viability, and 21 availability of infrastructure. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21061.1; Guidelines, §§ 15126.6, subd.
22 (f)(1), 15364.) The determination of whether to include an alternative in an EIR is based on
23 whether the alternative is "potentially feasible." (South County Citizens for Smart Growth v.
24 County of Nevada (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 316, 327 [emphasis added, citation omitted]; see also
25 Sierra Club V. County of Napa (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 1490, 1504, fn. 5 [EIR "is required to

26 make an in-depth discussion of those alternatives identified as at least potentially feasible"].)

27 "The fact that an alternative may be more expensive or less profitable is not sufficient to show

28 that the alternative is financially infeasible." (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors
(1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 1167, 1181; accord Uphold Our Heritage V. Town of Woodside (2007)

2 185 Cal.App.4th 866, 883 (CBD).)
31. In sum, "[a]n alternatives analysis in an EIR is intended to facilitate consideration 3 of whether an environmentally superior alternative could meet most project objectives; therefore,
4 the key to the selection of the range of alternatives is to identify alternatives that meet most of
5 the project's objectives but have a reduced level of environmental impacts." (Bay Area Citizens
6 V. Assn. of Bay Area Govts. (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 966, 1014 [internal quotations and citation
7 omitted]; see also Habitat and Watershed Caretakers v. City of Santa Cruz (2013) 213

8 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1304 ["[a] potentially feasible alternative that might avoid a significant

Q impact must be discussed and analyzed in an EIR"].).

10 Standard for Adequacy of Impact Analysis in an EIR
32. "As a general matter the EIR must present facts and analysis, not simply the bare 11 conclusions or opinions of the agency. The discussion of impacts is acceptable if it provides 12 sufficient information and analysis to allow the public to discern the basis for the agency's
13 impact findings. Thus the EIR should set forth specific data, as needed to meaningfully assess
14 whether the proposed activities would result in significant impacts." (Bay Area Citizens, supra,
15 248 Cal.App.4th at p. 977 [quoting Californians for Alternatives to Toxics v. Calif. Dept. of Food
16 and Agric. (2005) 136 Cal.App.4th 1, 13]; see also Laurel Heights, supra, 47 Cal.3d at pp. 404-

17 405 ["[w]ithout meaningful analysis ... in the EIR, neither the courts nor the public can fulfill

18 their proper roles in the CEQA process"].).
33. CEQA Guidelines § 15126.2(a) provides that the discussion of environmental 19 impacts "should include relevant specifics of the area, the resources involved, physical changes, 20 alterations to ecological systems, and changes induced in…other aspects of the resource base..."
21 The "relevant specifics" must include a discussion of the precise nature and magnitude of
22 significance of the Project's anticipated effects if it is reasonably scientifically possible is to do so,
23 and if it is not scientifically possible, to explain why. (Sierra Club v. County of Fresno (2018) 6
24 Cal.5th 502, 519-20.)

25 CEQA Requires Meaningful Consideration of All Feasible Mitigation Measures to Reduce the
Potentially Significant Impacts of a Project
26 34. a "CEQA contains a 'substantive mandate' requiring public agencies to refrain from
27 approving projects with significant environmental effects if *there are feasible alternatives or
28 mitigation measures' that can substantially lessen or avoid those effects." (County of San Diego

3 Code, § 21002].) "Under CEQA, the public agency bears the burden of affirmatively
demonstrating that, notwithstanding a project's impact on the environment, the agency's
4 approval of the proposed project followed meaningful consideration of alternatives and
5 mitigation measures." (Mountain Lion Foundation, supra, 16 Cal.4th at p. 134.)
6 35. An EIR must "describe feasible measures which could minimize significant
7 adverse impacts," distinguishing between measures proposed by the project proponent versus

8 other measures proposed by the lead agency and responsible or trustee agencies or other persons.
9 | (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4, subds. (a)(1) & (a)(1)(A).) "Mitigation measures must be fully

10 enforceable through permit conditions, agreements, or other legally-binding instruments.' (Id., §

11 15126.4, subd. (a)(2).) "For each significant effect, the EIR must identify specific mitigation
measures; where several potential mitigation measures are available, each should be discussed
12 separately, and the reasons for choosing one over the others should be stated." (Sacramento Old
13 City Assn. v. City Council (1991) 229 Cal.App.3d 1011, 1027.)
14 36. Mitigation measures must be designed to: (1) avoid "the impact altogether by not
15 taking a certain action or parts of an action;" (2) minimize "impacts by limiting the degree or
16 magnitude of the action and its implementation;" (3) rectify "the impact by repairing,
17 rehabilitating, or restoring the impacted environment;" (4) reduce or eliminate "the impact over

18 time by preservation and maintenance operations during the life of the action;" or (5) compensate

19 "for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments." (CEQA

20 Guidelines, § 15370.) An EIR must include facts and analysis "to support the inference that the
mitigation measures will have a quantifiable *substantial' impact on reducing [a project's] 21 adverse effects," although the measures need not necessarily reduce an impact to below the
22 threshold of significance. (Sierra Club, supra, 6 Cal.5th at p. 522.)
23 37. An EIR's finding that a mitigation measure is economically or otherwise
24 infeasible must be supported by substantial evidence in the record. (See County of San Diego v.
25 Grossmont-Cuyamaca Commun. College Dist. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 86, 108 ["[w]ithout

26 evidence of the amount of any such cost, we must conclude there is no substantial evidence to

27 support the District's claim that mitigation of the adverse project-related off-campus traffic

28 impacts is economically infcasible"].) The conclusion that a project's adverse environmental

-10-

effects have been adequately mitigated also must be based on substantial evidence. (Laurel

2 Heights, supra, 47 Cal.3d at pp. 407-408.)
PRC § 21002.1(c) Requires Compliance with Other Laws When There are Significant and 3
Unavoidable Impacts
4 38. PRC section 21002.1(c) requires that "Ti]f economic, social, or other conditions make it
5 infeasible to mitigate one or more significant effects on the environment of a project, the project may
6 nonetheless be carried out or approved..." but only if "the project is otherwise permissible under
7 applicable laws and regulations." (emphasis added.)

8 Bird Species Affected by the Project are Protected by Various Federal and State Laws

9 39. In addition to being protected under CEQA, many bird species affected by wind energy

10 projects are protected under various other federal and state laws, including the federal and state

11 Endangered Species Acts, federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act, federal Bald and Golden Eagle Protection
Act, and multiple provisions of the California Fish and Game Code.
12 40. Swainson's Hawks and Tricolored Blackbirds have been identified on the Project site,
13 which are listed as threatened species under the California Endangered Species Act (CESA), Fish and
14 Game Code section 2050 et seq., and thereby protected from "take" under this state law.2 (Fish & G.
15 Code, § 2080.) The golden eagle, California condor and white-tailed kite, which also have been
16 identified onsite, are listed as "fully protected species" and likewise protected from take under state law.

17 (Fish & G. Code, § 3511, subds. (a)(1), (b)(5), (7), (12).)3 The California condor also is listed as an

18 endangered species under both the federal ESA and CESA.

Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a substantial benefit on the public, including
21 citizens, residents, businesses and taxpayers of the City, and will result in the enforcement of important
22 public rights by requiring Respondent to comply with CEQA and other legal requirements applicable to
23 the proposed Project; by voiding the Project approvals and prohibiting Respondent and Real Parties in
24 Interest from taking further actions with respect to the Project until it has complied with those legal
25

26 Fish and Game Code section 86 defines "take" as to "hunt, pursue, catch, capture, or kill," or to attempt to do any of these things.
27 Fish and Game Code sections 3503.5 and 3513 further prohibit take of any raptors and their nests and

28 eggs and prohibit take of all birds protected under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act, respectively. (See also id., § 3800, subd. (a) (prohibiting take of all non-game birds, except as provided in the Fish and Game Code).) -11-

STATEMENT OF FACTS
3 Project Timeline
4 42. RPI filed an application for Conditional Use Permit (CUP), PLN2019-00226 in
5 December 2019 to allow for construction of the Project.
6 43. The Project is located in the Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area (APWRA) which was
7 subject of a Program EIR (PEIR) which the East County Board of Zoning Adjustments (EBZA)

8 certified by adoption of Resolution Z-14-40 on November 12, 2014, as being CEQA-compliant. The

© PEIR analyzed the general impacts of repowering the APWRA with up to 450 MW of new generation

10 wind turbines on the Alameda County side of the designated wind resource area, replacing old

11 generation turbines which had been operating in this area since the 1980s and which, with certain

12 exceptions, the County had required the previous operators to remove by the end of 2015.
44. A Notice of Preparation (NOP) of a Subsequent EIR (DSEIR) for the Project was issued
13 on April 6, 2020. The DSEIR was released for public comment between November 6, 2020, and
14 December 21, 2020, and then extended for comment through January 8, 2021.
15 45. On April 22, 2021, EBZA held a virtual public hearing on the CUP application and the
16 Final SEIR (SEIR or FSEIR) and adopted Resolutions Z-21-13 and Z-21-14 which certified the FSEIR

17 for the Project and approved CUP 2019-00226.

18 46. Petitioners filed an appeal of the EBZA decision and approval on April 29, 2021 to the

19 County Board of Supervisors ("Board") and stated the basis for the inadequacies of the FSEIR pursuant

20 to CEQA and that the terms of the CUP failed to adequately characterize, analyze, avoid, minimize or
mitigate the significant environmental impacts of the Project on birds and bats, due to construction of 21 operation of up to 83 MW of new wind turbines between 2.2 and 4.2 MW each. These turbines would
22 be installed an area of the APWRA that Respondent admits previously only had 51.8 MW total
23 operating capacity with much smaller turbines, and that has not had any operating turbines on the
24 project site since 2016.

25 47. On October 5, 2021, Petitioners provided comments to Respondent requesting that the

26 County overturn the EBZA approval of the SEIR or stay the Petitioners' appeal and direct the County

27 Planning Dept. to convene the technical advisory committee and incorporate the advisory committee's

28 recommendations into the Project's SEIR and conditions of approval.
48. On October 7, 2021, the Respondent and Lead Agency, County of Alameda, through the
-12-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

Board of Supervisors, denied the Petitioners' appeal and upheld the certification of the SEIR and

2 approved CUP 2019-00226.
The Project and its Impacts to Protected Bird and Bat Species in the APWRA
49. This Project comes at the tail end of the repowering program for the Alameda County 4 side of Altamont Pass, and also follows the availability of significant new scientific information,
5 including additional monitoring reports for repowering projects operating at Altamont Pass, which
6 indicate that these repowering projects are having substantially more severe impacts on birds and bats
7 than previously anticipated in the PEIR.

8 50. The cumulative impacts of wind energy projects on avian and bat resources at Altamont

9 Pass is now amply scientifically documented through several years of project monitoring reports, as

10 well as extensive scientific studies of the effects of wind turbines on birds and bats in the area, the latter

11 of which were funded in large part by the 2010 settlement agreement between the Attorney General's
Office, Golden Gate Audubon Society and Next Era Energy Resources (2010 Attorney General 12 Agreement). These monitoring reports and studies demonstrate that impacts to golden eagles, and
13 possibly other raptors such as red-tailed hawks, from approved repowering projects at Altamont Pass
14 are anticipated to exceed those of the old- generation turbines, and that impacts to bats, particularly
15 hoary bats and Mexican free-tailed bats, are unsustainably high.
16 Impacts of Wind Turbines on Golden Eagles

17 51. With regard to golden eagles, both the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and U.S.

18 Geological Survey (USGS) have recently re-confirmed that Altamont Pass is a "population sink" for

19 golden eagles, where immigration exceeds emigration.* (DSEIR, pp. 3.4-52 to 3.4-53 ("the high

20 incidence of subadults as territorial breeding pair members, and high turnover rates of individual pair
members, indicates the [Altamont Pass] is an ecological sink, continually attracting golden eagles into 21 prime foraging and nesting habitat that is of high risk to eagles, and for which survivorship is low.")
22 52. The results of the ongoing USGS surveys of golden eagle nesting and territorial pairs at
23 Altamont Pass show that these pairs "may experience a high rate [of] mortality and territory turnover
24 (i.e., mate replacement) relative to the surrounding region," which "indicate[s] that wind turbine-related
25 fatality of breeding and nonbreeding golden eagles at [Altamont Pass] may be affecting broader

26 population dynamics of this species in west-central California." (Wiens and Kolar 2019, p. 8.)t

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

F 53. Recent monitoring results for repowered projects show a high level of annual golden

2 eagle take that in some cases exceeds that of the old generation turbines. For example, the Golden Hills
Project final three-year monitoring report states: 3 The 3-year adjusted average of 0.16 fatalities/MW/year [for golden eagles] was nearly
4 twice as high as the [Altamont]-wide pre-repower rate of 0.08 fatalities/MW/year

5 represented in the Final Programmatic EIR. Also note that even the unadjusted average naïve-with-offplots estimate of 0.12 fatalities/MW/year, which we consider the most

6 accurate indicator from our study for this species, was higher than the adjusted estimates from all previous post- repower studies and still 50% higher than the pre-repower
7 estimate.•

8 54. The FSEIR documents seven active golden eagle territorial pairs within two miles or

9 less of the project footprint. (See FWS DSEIR letter, p. 6; FSEIR, 3.4-92, App. D, p. 3-12; H-66.) The

10 FSEIR.response to comments acknowledges that the Project will cause significant and unavoidable
direct, indirect and cumulative impacts on golden eagles, including "at all spatial scales up to and 11 including the LAP" (local area population). (FSEIR, H-3; see also H-4 and FSEIR, pp. 5-10 to 5-11, 5-
12 17.) The RTC also acknowledges that 2020 fires likely contributed to this cumulative impact problem,
13 but that the impact cannot be quantified. (Id., H-3.) The County further agrees that wind energy
14 development at Altamont Pass in general causes "substantial adverse effects on golden eagles." (Id., H-
15 57.)

16 55. However, the FSEIR fails to adequately analyze the actual nature and extent of these

17 significant impacts and to provide an adequate range of feasible alternative and mitigation measures to

18 avoid or reduce these impacts as required by CEQA, such as additional Project operational measures as

19 recommended by the FWS, elimination of turbines determined to be high-risk to eagles, and other
measures. This is despite the fact that "[t]he County agrees that disqualification of all high-risk turbine 20 sites would likely reduce impacts substantially." (FSEIR, H-16 (emphasis added).
21 Swainson's Hawks, Tricolored Blackbirds, and Burrowing Owls are also Present on the Project Site
22 56. The SEIR documented significant Swainson's Hawk observations, including an active
23 nest and territory on site. (DSEIR., pp. 3.4-24, 3.4-42, Table 3.4-2, (Swainson's Hawk "species
24 observed frequently during project field surveys"); id., App. D., p. 3-9, Fig. 8 (documenting onsite nest

25 and territory); id., pp. 3.4-25, 3.4-42 (six California Natural Diversity Database (CNDDB) records of

Swainson's hawks within 4-5 miles of the Project site).) ICF biologists identified a Swainson's Hawk

2 nest on the Project site in May 2020.
57.
3 The SEIR documented significant tricolored blackbird observations as well. There is at
least one onsite colony, and two offsite colonies within 0.25 and 0.6 miles of the Project site, and there
4 also is significant tricolored blackbird nesting, roosting and foraging habitat onsite. (Id., pp. 3.4-27, 3.4-
5 43, 3.4-91; App. C, p. 4-7; App. D, pp. 3-12 to 3-13, Fig. 10.) Each of these three colonies contained at
6 least fifty birds during the nesting season. (Id., p. 3.4-27; App. D, pp. 3-12 to 3-13.)
7 58. A high concentration of burrowing owls exists on this Project site. Suitable burrowing

8 owl nesting, wintering and foraging habitat exists throughout the Project site. (DSEIR, pp. 3.4-26, 3.4-

Q 42.) Three separate conservation areas that are protected and managed specifically for burrowing owl

10 are within or adjacent to the Project site. (Id., pp. 3.4-13, 3.4-26, 3.4-88, Fig. 3.4-1.) The DSEIR also

11 acknowledges that the Burrowing Owls are highly likely to be present and nesting onsite, based on

12 numerous "incidental" observations and six to seven CNDDB records for owls on the Project site. (Id.,
p. 3.4-26 (burrowing owls "were also observed on numerous occasions throughout the project site
13 during 2020 field surveys" and "ICF biologists observed [B]urrowing [O]wls in six locations in avian
14 use surveys conducted between June 2019 and June 2020"); p. 3.4-42 (species was "observed at several
15 locations throughout the project site"); p. 3.4-88 ("[s]everal [B]urrowing [O]wl sightings were made
16 throughout the project site" in 2019 and 2020 and Burrowing [O]wl[s] are expected to be nesting on the
17 project site and are known to also occupy adjacent preserve lands"); see also id., p. 3.4-90; App. C, pp.

18 3-28, 4-7; App. D, pp. 3-13 to 3-14, Fig. 10.)
59. 19 The FSEIR response to comments "acknowledges that active nests that are in proximity
to construction could be disturbed by noise and visual disturbances that could result in incidental loss of 20 nesting birds." (FSEIR, H-11.) The FSEIR likewise acknowledges that Project construction could cause 21 take of raptors and their nests, eggs and nestlings. (FSEIR, p. 3.4-90.) Finally, the FSEIR response to
22 comments admits that there is substantial evidence of "a declining population trend for the burrowing
23 owl in" the Altamont Pass, as well as "a statewide declining trend." (Id., H-14 to H-15; see FSEIR, pp.
24 5-10 [Altamont Pass "fatalities are contributing to further declines in a species that is already
25 uncommon in BCR 32 and is showing a long-term declining population trend; therefore, there is a

26 cumulative impact on this species"].)

27 60. Despite this, as with the golden eagle impacts, the FSEIR fails to adequately analyze the

28 actual nature and extent of these significant impacts on CESA-threatened, fully protected and other
sensitive and declining bird species that exist on and adjacent to the Project site, and to provide an
-15-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

adequate range of feasible alternatives and Project construction and operation mitigation measures to

2 avoid or reduce these impacts as recommended by CDFW, FWS and other experts, as required by

3 CEQA. The FSEIR also did not include protocol-level surveys for Swainson's hawks, tri-colored
blackbirds or burrowing owls on and around the Project site, or include any Project operational
4 mitigation measures or reduction in the number of turbines for these CESA-listed and sensitive bird
5 species. The FSEIR also does not include an adequate analysis of impacts to, and mitigation measures
6 for, Project impacts on the on-site and adjacent CDFW-managed preserves.
7 Impacts of Wind Turbines on Bat Species

8 61. A similar and perhaps even more significant cumulative impact problem exists with

0 regard to wind turbine impacts on bats. For example, a recent study published in Issues in Ecology and

10 authored by T.D. Allison et al., estimates that, using adjusted fatality rate data from publicly available

11 studies for land-based wind energy projects, "estimates of average cumulative annual bird fatalities in
the continental U.S. published in 2013 and 2014 ranged from approximately 230,000 to 600,000 birds 12 per year, [and] estimates of cumulative bat fatalities published during that same period ranged from
13 200,000 to 800,000 bats per year.36
14 62. New studies reveal that the ongoing cumulative effects of wind energy are already
15 having population-level effects on affected bat (and many bird) species. (See, e.g., Allison 2019, p. 8.
16 (*population size or dynamics of some [affected bat] species may be negatively affected from increases

17 in mortality from collisions at wind turbines," and "modeling results suggest some of these species are

18 at risk of population decline due to collision fatalities).7
63.
19 Both the Golden Hills final three-year monitoring report and Golden Hills North one-

20 year monitoring report document staggering numbers of annual bat fatalities at these two projects,
particularly of hoary bats and Mexican free-tailed bats, which make up 90% of the fatalities at
21 Altamont Pass. (DSEIR, pp. 3.4-57, 3.4-123.) The annual bat fatality rates for these two projects range
22 from 6.10 to 14.59 bat fatalities per MW per year, which is orders of magnitude higher than the PEIR
23 baseline of 1.679 fatalities per MW per year and equals between 800 and nearly 2,000 bats killed every
24 year by these two projects alone.8

1 64. The SEIR admits that the cumulative impacts of wind turbine operations on bats at

2 Altamont Pass, including the estimated impacts from the Project, are severe, potentially resulting in

3 population-level effects on hoary bats, which are declining throughout the west coast. (FSEIR, pp. 3.4-
56, 3.4-121 to 3.4-122, 5-16.) The FSEIR response to comments admits fully repowered Altamont 4 will kill thousands of bats annually. (FSEIR, H-35; FSEIR, Table 5-1 & pp. 5-15 to 5-16, 5-17 to 5-18.)
5 65. However, as with the avian impacts, the FSEIR fails to adequately analyze the actual
6 nature and extent of these significant impacts on bat species that exist on and adjacent to the Project site
7 or that seasonally migrate through the Project site, and to provide an adequate range of feasible

8 alternatives and Project construction and operation mitigation measures to avoid or reduce these

9 impacts as required by CEQA. The SEIR also does not include an analysis of the extent and location of

10 bat roosts that may exist on the Project site.

11 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violations of CEQA; EIR Does Not Comply With CEQA) 12 66. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate all the above paragraphs as if fully set forth 13 herein.
14 67. CEQA requires the lead agency for a project to prepare an environmental impact report,
15 initial study or mitigated negative declaration that complies with the requirements of the statute. The
16 lead agency also must provide for public review and comment on the project and associated

17 environmental documentation. An environmental impact report, initial study or mitigated negative

18 declaration must provide an adequate project description and sufficient environmental analysis such

19 that decision-makers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on the

20 proposed project.
68. Respondent violated CEQA by failing to include a complete and accurate project 21 description in the EIR which precluded meaningful analysis of the Project's environmental impacts and
22 consideration of a reasonable range of alternatives.
23 a. The SEIR does not commit to a turbine size and instead proposes a spectrum of
24 alternative schemes: up to 36 turbines at a range of different turbine sizes from 2.2 MW to 4.2 MW per
25 turbine. (DSEIR, pp. 1-1, 2-6, 2-9; see also id.. App. D, p. 1-1 (*[t]he exact turbine model has not yet

26 been selected," therefore, the proposed project includes "up to 36 turbine sites and a range of potential

27

28

-17-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

turbine specifications").) For purposes of the environmental analysis, the DSEIR assumes a layout of

2 36, 2.2 MW turbines, the minimum turbine size. (DSEIR, p. 2-9.)
b.
3 The SEIR does not fully describe and separately evaluate the range of turbines
proposed in this project description. The SEIR assumes the turbines will be 2.2 MW, at the lowest end
4 of the range, and bases its environmental analysis and alternatives on that 36 turbine 2.2 MW
5 configuration. The SEIR admits it is deferring environmental analysis of the precise Project
6 configuration, saying that "[the exact turbine model is still being evaluated but would be selected
7 based on... environmental considerations, bird use survey results, and avian micro- siting
8 considerations." (DSEIR, p. 2-6.)

0 69. The SEIR's statement of project objectives is also impermissibly narrow, essentially

10 defining the Project objectives as the Project itself. (See DSEIR, pp. ES-2, 2-5, 4-2 (stating that the

11 "fundamental" project objective is "[t]o site up to 36 new wind turbines that will produce and deliver
80
12 MW of commercially viable wind energy ... through a long-term power purchase agreement with
a local community choice aggregator*).) This "artificially narrow" statement of project objectives
13 unlawfully constrains the SEIR's analysis of a reasonable range of project alternatives. (See North
14 Coast Rivers Alliance v. Kawamura (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 647, 668- 669 (quoting In Re Bay Delta
15 (2008) 43 Cal.4th 1143, 1166).)

16 a. The SEIR did not even consider, let alone consider and then eliminate, a project

17 of less than 80 MW in size. (DSEIR, pp. 4-1 to 4-9.)

18 70. Failure to adequately analyze the Project's environmental baseline and impact as:

a. 19 Respondent improperly used historical Project site conditions to assess the

20 degree of significance of the proposed Project's environmental effects.
b. The environmental analysis in the biological resources section of the SEIR relies
21 on a now-hypothetical historic conditions baseline of previously operating old-generation turbines for
22 purposes of evaluating the ongoing operational impacts of the Project on birds and bats.
23 C, Currently, the Project site consists of undeveloped land adjacent to and within
24 essential habitat for sensitive biological resources. (See DSEIR, p. 4-13 ("the project site is currently

25 undeveloped" land).) The Project site also is within Conservation Zone 10 of the East Alameda County

26 Conservation Strategy and adjacent to the only designated "Type 1" open space in this zone. (Id., p.

27 3.4-7; East Alameda County Conservation Strategy, Chapter 3: Conservation Strategy (October 2010),

28 Figure 3-3.)

-18-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 d. The current condition of the Project site is undeveloped land that is within and

2 adjacent to open space and designated protected habitat for sensitive species.

e. In addition, even if use of an historical baseline were appropriate, the FSEIR
improperly and inadequately characterized those historical conditions, failing to compare the impacts of 4 the proposed 80-MW Project with the 51.8 MW smaller turbine project that previously existed on the
Project site. The FSEIR fails to disclose that the Project "replaces" 51.8 MW of capacity with 80-83
6 MW of operational capacity, a 47% increase in operational capacity for this site. The prior, old
7 generation project consisted of several hundred 100 kw to 400 a kw turbines for a total of only 51.8 MW

8 of installed capacity. The Project, on the other hand, as discussed, would consist of up to 36 new 2.2 to

9 4.2 MW turbines, for a total installed capacity of up to 83 MW. (DSEIR, p. 1-1.) The FSEIR fails to

10 compare the impacts of the Project against this baseline, instead improperly relying on the PEIR's

11 anticipated projection of an 80-MW project for this site.
71.
12 The SEIR fails to describe and analyze a reasonable range of project alternatives.
a. In addition to the CEQA-mandated "No Project-No Repowering" alternative, the 13 SEIR analyzes two purported alternatives, both of which maintain an operational capacity of at least 80
14 MW for the Project and involve some degree of the already-required micro-siting: the "Micro- Sited
15 Alternative" and the "Reduced Project Alternative." (DSEIR, pp. 4-4 to 4-6, 4-13 to 4-24.)
16 b. The "Micro-Sited Alternative" would involve the "same turbines proposed for
17 use" in the proposed Project but would adjust the location of some turbines in response to a micro-siting

18 analysis. (DSEIR, p. 4-14.)

19 C. The micro-sited alternative cannot be considered a true alternative to the proposed

20 Project as required by CEQA because the PEIR already requires such micro-siting to be done for all
repowering projects. (See PEIR, pp. 3.4-109 to 3.4-110 and DSEIR, p. 3.4-108 (requiring all project 21 proponents to "prepare a siting analysis" and "conduct a siting process" in order "to select turbine
22 locations to minimize potential impacts on bird and bat species" based on the best available science and
23 field data).)

24 d. The "Micro-Sited Alternative" in fact involves only a minimal degree of micro-
25 siting in response to the expert's recommendations. This alternative still retains half of the high- and

26 moderate-high-risk turbine sites identified in the project micro-siting reports.

27 e. While the Micro-Sited Alternative states that it considered the risk to raptors

28 (DSEIR, p. 4- 14), the expert actually excluded consideration of risks to other raptors besides golden
eagles based on allegedly insufficient information regarding raptor use of the site.

- f. The SEIR and supporting documents also lack the required analysis of the relative

2 extent to which the Micro-Sited Alternative is expected to reduce the Project's impacts on raptors based

3 on the best available data. Rather, the DSEIR only contains conclusory and general assertions that the

4 Micro-Sited Alternative "would reduce raptor fatalities" and that the impacts of this alternative would

5 be "less" or "similar." (See DSEIR, pp. 4-14 to 4-15.)

g.

6 The Reduced Project alternative also maintains or increases the Project's
operational capacity and is not in fact reduced in size.
7 h.

8 The purported Reduced Project alternative also improperly relies on an entirely
new and untested metric (the "rotor swept area" or RSA metric) for measuring the Project's projected

0 bird and bat fatalities that was not included as a fatality metric in the PEIR and which has never been

10 used for any project in the APWRA. The SEIR further contains inconsistent statements regarding the

11 need to maintain use of the PEIR's standard fatalities per MW per year metric for other purposes, which

12 statements wholly undercut the SEIR's conclusions regarding the validity and appropriateness of the

13 new RSA metric to justify an actual reduction in impacts from the Reduced Project alternative.
i.
14 The FSEIR also fails to demonstrate, based on substantial evidence, that the

15 Reduced Project alternative actually will reduces the Project's significant impacts to bird and bat species.

16 For example, the FSEIR simply assumes, without evidence, that impacts to birds and bats increase or

17 decrease proportionally with each percentage increase in RSA with regard to each species or species
group, and contains illogical and non-sensical justifications for the purported reduction in project

18 impacts of the Reduced Project alternative. The FSEIR response to comments admits that the RSA

19 metric itself cannot be adequately quantified, and that at best it cannot be determined whether this

20 actually will result in any reduced impacts on birds and bats. (FSEIR, H-63.) In fact, the response to

21 comments further concedes that "fatality rates calculated on an RSA basis are higher than rates

22 calculated on an MW basis," but then absurdly claims that "It]his difference is irrelevant to the

23 comparison of RSA between one alternative to another." (Id.)
j.

24 The SEIR further recognized that the larger turbines of the Reduced Project

25 Alternative may result in equal or greater avian and bat impacts than the proposed Project. This is based
on (in addition to the total MW for this alternative) the taller turbine heights, reduced rotor heights and

26 reduced blade heights above ground for the larger turbines, locations of individual turbines relative to

27 other onsite features, and other risk factors. (DSEIR, p. 4-20.)

28 k. The FSEIR unlawfully fails to consider an actually reduced project alternative of
reduced MW. The FSEIR admits that such a reduced MW alternative "would likely reduce impacts

- substantially," but improperly justifies the FSEIR failure to analyze such an alternative based on the

2 unlawfully narrowly-defined Project objectives to construct an 80 MW project. (FSEIR, H-16, H-54, H-

3 56, H-57.)
1.
4 72.
5 The SEIR did not include adequate facts and analysis, provide sufficient information or

6 discussion of the Project's impacts as to meaningfully assess whether the Project's activities would
result in significant environmental impacts.
7 a.

8 The SEIR did not include adequate analysis or discussion of the effects of:
i.

9 ii. the larger overall Project size and larger turbine size;
the Project's effects on affected avian and bat resources and their habitat;

10 iii. the Project's effects on conservation lands on and adjacent to the Project

11 site; or

12 iv.

13 wetland and riparian habitats. the impacts of turbine and road construction on site topography and pond,

73.
14 The SEIR omits critical information to meaningfully assess the actual extent of the

15 Project's significant effects on avian and bat resources, such as the 47% increase in total installed

16 capacity proposed for the Project site, from approximately 55 MW to 80 MW.
74. The SEIR failed to consider or include discussion of mitigation measures that could
17 substantially lessen or avoid the significant environmental effects of the Project as required by CEQA

18 and defers implementation or discussion of Project mitigation measures until a future uncertain date.

19 a. As with prior wind energy projects in the Altamont Pass, this SEIR relies mostly

20 upon the PEIR's avian and bat adaptive management programs, which defers implementation of

21 additional mitigation until project fatality monitoring data shows an increase in fatalities above the
PEIR baseline.
22 b.

23 Many mitigation measures have been further studied since certification of the

24 PEIR and have proven to be both feasible and effective in substantially reducing fatalities to birds and

25 bats caused by wind repowering projects. Such mitigation measures were not analyzed, discussed,
considered, or adopted in the SEIR.

26 C. These mitigation measures must be considered in the SEIR and the mitigation

27 measures rejected only if the County makes
evidence. finding that they are infeasible based on substantial

- 75. As iterated above, PRC $ 21002.1(c) requires that "[i]f economic, social, or other

2 conditions make it infeasible to mitigate one or more significant effects on the environment of a project,

3 the project may nonetheless be carried out or approved..." but only if "the project is otherwise

4 permissible under applicable laws and regulations." (emphasis added.)

a.

5 The Project, however, includes significant and unmitigated environmental impacts

6 to biological resources and is not in compliance with other non-CEQA laws and regulations that pertain

7 to protected bird and bat species affected by the Project's activities.
b.

8 First, both Swainson's Hawks and Tricolored Blackbirds have been identified on

9 the Project site, and both are listed as threatened species under the California Endangered Species Act
(CESA), Fish and Game Code section 2050 et seq., and thereby protected from "take" under this state

10 law.' (Fish & G. Code, § 2080.)

11 C. Second, the Golden Eagle, California Condor and White-tailed Kite, which also

12 have been identified onsite, are listed as "fully protected species" and likewise protected from take unden

13 state law. (Fish & G. Code, § 3511, subds. (a)(1), (b)(5), (7), (12).)° The California Condor also is listed

14 as an endangered species under both the federal ESA and CESA.
d.

15 Finally, other migratory bird species, including Western Meadowlark, Horned

16 Lark, and Loggerhead Shrike have been documented to be killed by wind turbines in the APWRA in

17 high numbers, and are likewise protected from take under the federal MBTA and California Fish &
Game Code section 3513.

18 e. The County has not considered or adopted all feasible Project mitigation measures

19 or alternatives which would minimize or avoid "take" of the aforementioned protected species. As such,

20 the SEIR is not in compliance with CEQA but it also does not comply with the requirements of CESA,

21 ESA, and the Fish & Game Code.

76.
22 The SEIR omitted information required by CEQA and otherwise failed to otherwise

23 adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's environmental impacts.
77.

24 a As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused their discretion by

25 making determinations or adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA and

26

27 Fish and Game Code sections 3503.5 and 3513 further prohibit take of any raptors and their nests and

28 eggs and prohibit take of all birds protected under the federal Migratory Bird Treaty Act, respectively. (See also id., § 3800, subd. (a) (prohibiting take of all non-game birds, except as provided in the Fish and Game Code).)

approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondent's adoption of the mitigated negative

2 declaration and purported approval of the Project must be set aside.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
3 (Violations of CEQA; Failure to Substantially Support Factual Findings)
4 78. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates all of the above paragraphs as if fully set
5 forth herein.

6 79. CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be supported
7 by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that a lead agency provide

8 an explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions it has reached.

Q 80. Respondent violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter of law

10 as they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including but not limited to the

11 following:

a. The determinations that the Project's environmental impacts would be less than 12 significant or that adopted mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the Project's significant effects
13 on the environment to less than significant levels.
14 b. The determination that all feasible mitigation measures had been adopted to
15 mitigate the Project's significant and unmitigable environmental impacts.

16 81. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused their discretion by

17 making determinations or adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA and

18 approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondent's adoption of the mitigated

19 negative declaration and purported approval of the Project must be set aside.
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
20 (Violations of CEQA; Failure to Recirculate Environmental Impact Report)
21 82. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates all of the above paragraphs as if fully set
22 forth herein.

23 83. CEQA requires recirculation of an environmental impact report whenever substantial
24 revisions have been made to the mitigated negative declaration

25 84. The Final EIR for the Project was released included significant revisions to the Project,

26 findings, determinations and analysis.

27 85. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused their discretion by

28 failing to proceed in a manner required by law as required by CEQA and approving the Project in

F reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondents' adoption of the environmental impact report, related

2 environmental findings and purported approval of the Project must be set aside.
PRAYER FOR RELIEF
3 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as set forth below:
4 A. For a writ of mandate commanding Respondent to vacate any purported approvals of the
5 Project, and to require Respondent to complete the CEQA environmental review and public comment
6 period as required by law;
7 B. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent
8 injunctions enjoining Respondent and Real Parties in Interest, and their agents, employees, officers or
o representatives, and all persons acting in concert or participating with Real Parties in Interest from taking

10 any action to implement the project, unless and until Respondent fully comply with CEQA;
C. a For a declaration of the rights and duties of the parties hereto, including but not limited 11 to a declaratory judgment that Respondent violated its duty pursuant CEQA and that the project approvals 12 are null and void and without legal effect; and
13 E. For such other relief as this Court deems appropriate and just.
