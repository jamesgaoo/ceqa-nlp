20 INTRODUCTION

21 1. In the year 2000, California voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 12, creating a
22 $2.1 billion bond "to spend on acquisition, development, and protection of recreational, cultural, and
23 natural areas."

24 2. Twenty-five million dollars of the bond was specifically to be allocated "to acquire,
25 protect, and restore wetlands projects that are a minimum of 400 acres in size in any county with a
26 population greater than 5,000,000," referring specifically to Ballona Wetlands, currently home to
27 approximately 1,700 animal and - plant species - some threatened and endangered, and the last remaining
28 coastal wetlands in Los Angeles.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 3. In related case Defend Ballona Wetlands v. California State Coastal Conservancy, Case

2 No. 20STCV29911, Petitioners are separately challenging the actions of the California Coastal

3 Conservancy and its Executive Director, Sam Schuchat, (who has a documented history of investing in

4 the fossil fuel industry as seen at https://www.laweekly.com/why-does-a-coastal-conservancy-exec-
5 own-piles-of-offshore-oil-stock/), in having misspent more than $12,000,000 of this bond money

6 researching ways to destroy the wetlands, so that Schuchat's allies at SoCalGas/Sempra can upgrade

7 their storage facility for natural gas under the wetlands, under the guise of "restoration."

8 4. The dangerous practice of underground fossil fuel storage on the Los Angeles coast

9 began in the 1940s and continues to this day, unbeknownst to the public. This practice allows SoCalGas

10 to purchase natural gas cheaply during summer months, pipe it in to California from Oklahoma, Texas
11 and Utah, pump it into the it ground below the wetlands, and then pump it out again to resell in the winter

12 when natural gas is more expensive. The archaic oil and gas storage infrastructure is now crumbling.

13 5. Elected officials, fearful of another explosion like the one that occurred at Aliso Canyon,

14 have called for shutting down the facility under the Ballona Wetlands. In a desperate effort to avoid

15 closure, this cynical and counterfeit "restoration" is a pretext for the real agenda of fixing old and adding

16 newer infrastructure.

17 6. To this end, Schuchat and his industry-captured agency have also financed front groups

18 to pitch the project, most notably The Santa Monica Bay Restoration Foundation (also known as "The

19 Bay Foundation"), which planned and designed the bulldozing and excavation project Respondent
20 CDFW is inaccurately touting as a "restoration." The Bay Foundation is a private entity that owns no

21 land at Ballona, but receives funding from SoCalGas and also had a SoCalGas executive on its board of

22 directors until late last summer. The previous executive director of this organization is now the CEO of

23 Heal the Bay, which additionally supports the bulldozing/excavation plan and has also received funding

24 from SoCalGas for many years.

25 7. The Bay Foundation has received significant sums of money from the State Coastal
26 Conservancy to oversee the management and planning process for the project proposed for the Ballona

27 Wetlands. The Bay Foundation is also a defendant in Petitioners' related case challenging the

28 misspending of bond money on this counterfeit "restoration."

2
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

8. Other groups that are supporting the project have also received funding from SoCalGas.

2 One prominent one, Friends of Ballona Wetlands, has a current executive from SoCalGas on its board of
directors, currently serving as Vice President for the "Friends." Additionally, Jacob Lipa, was the

4 President of the Friends of Ballona Wetlands from 2008-2010, when the proposal for excavation and

5 bulldozing of the Ballona Wetlands was being finalized. Lipa is still listed as of today on the website for

6 Friends of Ballona Wetlands as a "Board Delegate.' Lipa was also the President of the engineering firm,

7 Psomas, a post he held for 17 years. Coincidentally, the Coastal Conservancy awarded Psomas a

8 contract in 2013 for more than $2 million for work on the "enhancement" of the Ballona Wetlands State

9 Ecological Reserve. A recent extension of this contract was signed on January 1, 2018.

10 9. Proponents of this disingenuous project falsely describe the Ballona Wetlands State

11 Ecological Reserve as being terribly "degraded" and needing intervention or "the wetlands will die,"

12 when it is actually thriving and teeming with wildlife, including being relied on by seven endangered

13 species and dozens of species on the State of California's list of Species of Special Concern.
14 10. Most of the surface rights to the land are owned by Respondent CDFW, while 60 acres of
15 the surface rights are owned by the California State Lands Commission. Mineral rights for most of the
16 area are owned or leased by SoCalGas/Sempra. Some additional surface acreage immediately adjacent
17 to the ecological reserve, including sensitive wetlands, including an historical tidal slough, are owned by
18 SoCalGas (possibly long-term leased from the federal government.)

19 11. The waterway that runs through the middle of the ecological reserve, called Ballona

20 Creek, is owned/managed by US Army Corps of Engineers & Los Angeles County Public Works/Flood

21 Control District. Some of the land in the creek channel is also owned by CDFW.

22 12. A final Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") was released in December 2019. A

23 preferred project was not actually selected, but it was clear from the review documents which project

24 was being favored. The EIR was prepared by Respondent CDFW.

25 13, CDFW certified the EIR on December 30, 2020.

26 14. At the same time that the scoping began for the EIR process, the federal government was
27 required to undertake an environmental review process, as required by the National Environmental

28 Policy Act ("NEPA"). Because destruction, i.e. "filling," of wetlands is involved, the US Army Corps of

3
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Engineers, per the Clean Water Act, was designated as the federal lead agency. The Army Corps of
2 Engineers issued scoping, as well, and also issued a Draft Environmental Impact Statement ("EIS"), in

3 September of 2017, when the State issued its draft EIR. The only hearing for this proposed project was

4 convened in November of 2017, overseen by the US Army Corps of Engineers, CDFW and LA County

5 Flood Control District/Public Works. A transcript from that hearing is included in the FEIR.

6 15. The Army Corps of Engineers did not issue a final EIS at the same time that the state

7 issued its final EIR. The Army Corps of Engineers indicated at that time that it would be at least 1.5

8 years before it would be ready to issue Final EIS. Now, CDFW states it will be at least 2.5 years before

9 the Army Corps of Engineers would be expected to issue a Final EIS.

10 https:/cdfgnews.wordpress.com/2020/12/30/cdfw-approves-restoration-project-for-ballona-wetlands-
11 ecological-reserve/)

12 16. CDFW previously described the following anticipated timeline on its website:

13 CDFW begins preparing the next 408 application submittal to the Army Corps
14 of Engineers, including 60 percent design plans and detailed engineering

15 technical analyses (roughly six to 10 months)

16 Los Angeles County Flood Control District (LACFCD) provides input and agrees to submit the 408 application submittal on behalf of CDFW (roughly
17 three months)

18 • LACFCD submits 408 application submittal to the Army Corps of Engineers for
19 its review and processing (roughly 12 months), and subsequent review by the Army Corps of Engineers Headquarters in Washington, D.C. (unknown). Army
20 Corps of Engineers finalizes the Environmental Impact Statement

21 CDFW seeks approvals from other agencies, e.g. Coastal Commission, Regional
22 Water Quality Control Board, etc. (timing depends on the permitting agency's
process)
23 https://wildlife.ca.gov/Regions/5/Ballona-EIR)
24 17. Along with the certification of the EIR, CDFW has posted a "Ballona Wetlands
25 Restoration Project FAQs," which states, in part: "The EIR analyzed a range of restoration alternatives.
26 CDFW selected the most restorative option (*Alternative 1") but made a commitment to execute the
27 project in phases - which will allow for restoration to begin without having the entire sum of funding in
28 place. By utilizing phased approach, CDFW will also be able to monitor and evaluate smaller phases

4
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 of restoration.3 There is no description of these phases, or revealing of what these phases might entail or
2 how long they would last, whether or not other permits might be necessary or how these phases dovetail

3 with the federal NEPA process, leaving the public behind a veil of secrecy that CDFW apparently

4 wished to install. CEQA's intent of an EIR being an instrument of transparency for the public appears to

5 be ignored.

6 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7 18. This Court has jurisdiction over the claims asserted because Respondent is a state agency,

8 and relief is sought under CCP sections 526, 1060, 1085, and 1094.5; and PRC §§ 21168 and 21168.5.
9 19. Venue is proper in this county as the acts upon which this action is based occurred in this

10 county, and the project site is located in this county.
11 PARTIES

12 20. Petitioner Defend Ballona Wetlands is an unincorporated association formed in April,
13 2020, members of which previously commented on the draft EIR during the public comment period,

14 including Petitioners van de Hoek and Basler.

15 21. Petitioner Robert Jan van de Hoek is an individual residing in Los Angeles County. Van

16 de a Hoek is a wildlife biologist who commented on the draft EIR during the public comment period.

17 22. Respondent Molly Basler is an individual residing in Los Angeles County who

18 commented on the draft EIR during the public comment period.

19 23. Respondent California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW") is the lead agency for

20 the project.

21 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

22 24. Nearly $15,000,000 of Proposition 12 bonds were spent on the "planning" and

23 "engineering" for this destructive project - one that cannot legitimately be called a "restoration" but

24 rather is a destruction and creation of something entirely novel and different than what was in this place
25 for at least the last 4,000 years, even though the bond language does not say anything about "planning,"
26 "engineering," "demolishing" or "creation," but instead specified the money was only to be used to

27 "protect, acquire or restore" these wetlands.

28 25, A February 2., 2012 article appearing in The Argonaut entitled "FUNDING FOR

5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

HYDROLOGICAL STUDIES, PUBLIC ACCESS DESIGN IN ENVIRONMENTAL RESERVE"
reported on $6.25 million dollars from the Prop 12 bond that was allocated by the Coastal Conservancy

3 "for hydrological analysis and scenic trail design in the 600-acre ecological reserve." The article appears

4 at https://argonautnews.com/coastal-conservancy-approves-funding-for-hydrological-studies-public-
I access-design-in-environmental-reserve/

26. As stated in the article:

7 Coastal Conservancy Programs Manager Mary Small

8 said the commission, which has been conducting baseline environmental studies in Ballona, will work
9 with the technical experts hired by the conservancy.

10 "This will enable us to do the engineering work in
11 order to apply for required environmental permits,"
Small explained.
12 27. Santa Monica Bay Restoration Commission biologist Karina Johnston is quoted in the
13 article as stating: "I think there is some confusion between the funds that were allocated to go towards
14 the planning and science, and the actual restoration itself."
15 28. Misuse of funds by the State Coastal Conservancy has included flying staff to and from
16 Oakland to stay in hotels in Playa del Rey. State Coastal Conservancy staff were also observed dining
17 with The Bay Foundation staff at Cantalini's restaurant to discuss plans to destroy the reserve under the
18 guise of "restoration."
19 29. Los Angeles Audubon Society points out the disingenuous nature of this project in their
20 comments submitted to the draft EIR/EIS: "[T]he EIR fails to accurately describe the project. (LPP
21 Report, Section 3.1) The proposed project is not a restoration within the plain meaning of that term, nor
22 a restoration as that term is defined in the Code of Federal Regulations."
23 30. The Los Angeles Audubon Society Response to Draft EIR/EIS also points out: "[T]he
24 project is misnamed as a restoration project. As discussed by the attached report of Land Protection
25 Partners, the project is not restoration but rather removal of currently existing wetlands and replacement
26 with a non-naturally occurring wetland. Therefore, the project description is misleading."
27 31. Dr. Travis Longcore, who has studied the historical ecology of the area, states regularly
28 that the plans for Ballona would not lead to a "restoration." Specifically, Dr. Longcore has stated in a

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

T letter contained in the administrative record, "Moving the channels will not 'restore' the wetlands. To
2 the contrary, it would introduce permanent tidal flow to areas that historically did not have such flows."

3 32. Dr. Margot Griswold, a restoration ecologist, who is President of Los Angeles Audubon

4 Society, has also stated that this plan is "not a restoration." In a video that is part of the administrative

5 record, Dr. Griswold explains that the project is more accurately described as a "creation" of something

6 that did not exist before, which is a full tidal bay, and the destruction of a freshwater and brackish

7 wetlands.

8 33. Additionally, while the project calls for increasing public access, amenities, paid for with

9 state bond money, including bike racks and benches have already been installed, yet the public cannot

10 use them. The gates are locked to the Fiji Way gate, except to SoCalGas employees, who hold the keys

11 and drive their vehicles on the trails where the public could otherwise walk, learn about nature and enjoy

12 the ecological reserve.

13 34. Now, Respondent has the audacity to claim this sham "restoration" would provide public

14 access when such access already exists, yet some of it is being withheld from the public. In fact, the

15 public access that is touted as being so wonderful when the "restoration" is finished, will, instead, be

16 diminished, with a beloved, well-used bicycle path to be demolished (as seen at
17 https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2020-04-26/column-feeling-sad-lethargic-fearful-happiness-is-

18 just-a-bike-ride-away) and a recreational, competitive rowing area of the creek being rendered un-

19 usable, according to comments made in the EIR by the California Coastal Commission staff.

20 35. According to the EIR, this project, if it proceeds, would involve nine years of bulldozing

21 hundreds of acres of land, with the negative impacts glossed over and ignored. The impact would be to

22 almost the entirety of the 640 acres in this Ballona Wetlands State Ecological Reserve and adjacent State

23 Lands Commission lands, obliterating the natural beauty of this seaside community and spelling certain

24 death for thousands of wild animals with nowhere to go. The proposed project is not a restoration; it is a

25 boondoggle that is not in the public interest and is not adequately described in the EIR.

26 36. It is particularly cynical that CDFW is giving this proposed industrial habitat alteration

27 and construction project the green light under California Governor Gavin Newsom, whose cabinet

28 officials just this week convened hundreds of advocates for protection of nature to participate in a

7
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

"

P webinar supporting "climate smart land management" and other important concepts that lead the public
2 to believe there is a strong commitment in this state government to support "Nature Based Solutions" to

3 climate change. This project proposed for the Ballona Wetlands is the opposite of all that this initiative

4 is supposed to stand for.

5 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
6 (Writ of Mandate)
7 37. Petitioners incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.
8 38. Respondent CDFW is the lead agency responsible under the California Environmental
9 Quality Act ("CEQA") for evaluating the environmental impacts of the project.
10 39. CDFW caused a draft environmental impact report ("EIR") for the project to be prepared
11 and circulated from September 25, 2017 to February 5, 2018. The final EIR was completed on
12 December 20, 2019.
13 40. By decision by CDFW staff Ed Pert, dated December 30, 2020, respondent resolved to
14 certify the adequacy of the EIR under CEQA (Public Resources Code §§21000-21189.3). On December
15 30, 2020, Respondent certified the final EIR. A notice of determination to carry out the project was filed
16 by respondent on December 30, 2020.
17 41. Petitioner, other agencies, interested groups, and individuals made oral and written
18 comments on the draft EIR and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition.
19 42. Petitioners performed all conditions precedent to filing this action by complying with the
20 requirements of Public Resources Code $21167.5 in filing notice of this action on January 28, 2021.
21 43. CDFW's actions in certifying the EIR and adopting findings constitute a prejudicial
22 abuse of discretion in that it failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and its decision is not
23 supported by substantial evidence.
24 44. The project description in the EIR is incomplete and misleading in that it describes the
25 project as a "restoration," when it is in fact destruction of a mosaic of habitats, including the existing
26 wetlands, grasslands, coastal scrub, sand dune and other upland habitats, and the creation of something
27 entirely different.
28 45. The EIR fails to evaluate the project's significant impacts on grasslands and other

8
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 important upland habitats, as well as freshwater and brackish wetlands, the already vibrant estuary in

2 Ballona Creek, endangered species, and public access.

3 46. The EIR fails to respond adequately to comments on the draft EIR, including comments
4 regarding the project's significant impacts on grasslands and other important upland habitats, as well as

5 freshwater and brackish wetlands, endangered species, public access, and the project being a destruction

6 of the existing wetlands, including the estuary of Ballona Creek, rather than a "restoration."

7 47. Respondent failed to adopt a legally adequate statement of overriding considerations in

8 that there is no reason identified for destroying the brackish and freshwater wetlands, grasslands, coastal
9 scrub and other upland habitats, including habitat for endangered species, and public access.

10 48. In response to Comment Letter to DEIR by Robert Jan van de Hoek 03-61, asking where

11 the disclosures and discussions of impacts related to the longitudinal sandbar in the middle of Ballona

12 Creek are, CDFW responded inadequately: "See Draft EIS/EIR Appendix F1 for an analysis of the
13 sediment dynamics within Ballona Creek.' This response does not refer to any substantial evidence.
14 Petitioner did not ask for sediment dynamics found in Appendix F1, which is a micro-analysis based on

15 using the term of "sediment analysis."

16 49. Petitioner's questions asked for macro-geomorphology and landscape "impacts related to

17 the longitudinal sand bar in the middle of Ballona Creek." Clearly, Respondent does not even know that

18 there is a longitudinal sand bar landform type, which is a unique landscape feature of certain kinds of

19 estuaries. Respondent does not recognize that Ballona Creek is a functional estuary from a structural

20 geomorphology or landscape perspective.

21 50. Nor does Respondent recognize the significance of a longitudinal sand bar generally to

22 animal life and plant life, with regard to infauna (clams, worms, shrimp) and the epifauna/flora

23 (barnacles, marine algae, snails as a few a examples). There is a rare worm, first described as type locality

24 from Ballona Estuary (Del Rey Lagoon) known commonly as the Ballona Bristleworm (Polydora

25 nuchalis), which is found in the Longitudinal Sand Bar infauna of Ballona Creek Estuary.

26 51. Longitudinal sand bar is habitat for large schooling native fish at high tide such as the

27 Striped Mullet, prey for the rare Osprey. And at low tide, the longitudinal sand bar is vital habitat for

28 resting sea birds, shore birds, waterfowl, water birds, wading birds, and resting (hauled out) marine

9
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F mammals (seals and sea lions),

2 52. If the levees are bulldozed and demolished the estuary found between the levees with the

3 longitudinal sand bar would be destroyed and altered into so-called "meander," which would be dredged

4 at the margin of the project boundaries. built far away and recontoured artificially, with new levees

5 53. There is no substantial evidence in the record to back up Respondent's response to

6 Petitioner's comment about the longitudinal sand bar.

7 54. Under CEQA, the longitudinal sand bar is a part of the physical environment as a

8 hydrological and geomorphological and physiographic feature, the only one known in Los Angeles

9 County and rare. In the biological environment, there are also all the animals and plants associated with
10 longitudinal sand bar.

11 55. The longitudinal sand bar is approximately 0.5 miles in length, approximately 30 meters

12 in width and approximately 5 feet in depth of fine-sand, which forms sand ripples and micro-waves

13 year with a rhythm. during rising ocean tides twice each day of the

14 56. The longitudinal sand bar began to form in the late 1930s, after the 1938 flood that

15 resulted in human death and flooding damage, so the levees were constructed. The Longitudinal Sand

16 Bar became stable in all three dimensions mentioned above by the 1960s, now more than 50 years ago.

17 57. The Longitudinal Sand Bar as a geomorphic, physiographic, hydrologic, and coastal

18 landscape feature has established stability, now in a very a dynamic equilibrium.

19 58. There is no substantial evidence in the EIR with regard to the Longitudinal Sand Bar,

20 sometimes known as a "river bar," making the project description untruthful, untransparent, and

21 unscientific.

22 59. Another example of how Respondent dismissed and ignored public comments referring

23 to lack of substantial evidence is the "beneficial impact to carbon sequestration" section, which ignores

24 the commenter - who states that Respondent's claim that excavation of over two million cubic yards of

25 soil (and removing plants and animals in the process) is erroneous and that instead, leaving that carbon-

26 rich soil, plants and animals intact would "provide some of the best ways to sequester carbon." The
27 commenter's points are significant, and are not addressed in the carbon sequestration analysis - the
28 hundreds of acres of plants and animals are already storing and sequestering carbon.

10
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

T 60. Commenter Nicole Lackowski, who is a trained Climate Reality Leader, trained by Al

2 Gore in his Climate Reality Project, stated: "Wetlands - with their plants and life-filled soils - provide

3 some of the best ways to sequester carbon. But the project's proposed 'realignment' of creeks; lowering

4 of land; bulldozing; excavating over two million cubic yards of soil (and removing plants and animals in

5 the process) could completely destroy this fragile ecosystem."

6 61. Respondent's wholly inadequate response was simply, "See Response 06-12, which

about 7 discusses the Project's beneficial impact to carbon sequestration." The inadequate response was

8 future carbon sequestration, not the current carbon storage and sequestration that Ms. Lackowski

9 commented about existing at the ecological reserve, which includes thousands of trees, millions of

10 plants, bushes and rich soil, (which is increasingly understood by scientists to be important for carbon

11 storage and sequestration.)

12 62. Respondent's response to commenter Jill Stewart was also entirely inadequate, only

13 discussing what GHG/carbon sequestration in the future may be, without at all addressing the carbon

14 storage and carbon sequestration being displaced from the project.
Respondent seems to be looking at what the marsh might be like in 100 years, without 15 63.

16 addressing all of the carbon storage and carbon sequestration that is currently at Ballona in the

17 plants,animals and soil, which will be lost in the meantime.

18 64. There is no substantial evidence in the record to support Respondent's claim that a

19 project that removes the surface soil and nearly every plant and animal from the ecosystem is the

20 "Environmentally Superior Alternative."

21 65. On page 2-46 of the EIR, Respondent states it did not know about the illegal drains in the

22 wetlands until 2013, and then Respondent goes on to use the arguments it used with the Coastal

23 Commission about why the drains should be ignored. As was entered into the record by numerous

24 organizations, including Los Angeles Audubon Society and Sierra Club, it is clear that the Coastal

25 Commission did not agree that these drains were insignificant, and the Coastal Commission ordered the
26 drains to be sealed so that rain water would not be allowed to be drained from the wetlands, but rather

27 would soak into the soils where seasonal wetlands could once again be refreshed by that rain water.

28 66. Then on page 2-48 of the EIR, Respondent claims, "Consideration of the uncapped drains

11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

r (in place) was described accurately in the Draft EIS/EIR as part of the baseline condition because they

2 were present as part of the actual physical environment when the environmental analysis of the proposed

3 restoration project began."

4 67. The point of the public comments on this is that baseline conditions were not in

5 alignment with the capping of the drains, which did not take place for many months after the Coastal
6 Commission so ordered. This new baseline condition needs to be considered, which Respondent failed

7 to do.

8 68. This new information became obvious in between the time of the release of the Draft EIR

9 and the comments made on that DEIR. It has since become clear to observers that more rainwater was

10 able to soak into the soils, refreshing the seasonal wetlands in the areas where the drains had been

11 making these wetlands unnaturally dry for approximately 20 years. The EIR should have been re-

12 circulated, taking into account this new situation, prior to the Final EIR being certified.

13 69. Respondent also states on page 2-49, "As mentioned above, the uncapped drains have

14 had no measurable effect on the Ballona Reserve from either a biological or hydrological perspective. So

15 it is unclear how identifying or capping the drains could result in significant new information that would

16 require recirculation of the EIR."

17 70. This, again, re-states CDFW's assertions made during the hearing of the California

18 Coastal Commission of December, 2017, assertions which were rejected by the Coastal Commission and

19 are not supported by substantial evidence.

20 71. On pages 2-49 and 2-50, Respondent mentions Palmer's Goldenbush, which is not a

21 "common species." - yet, this is their puzzling rationale for not pursuing protection of the habitat that

22 supports this species: "As such, common species typically more readily reestablish themselves following

23 disturbance. It is also worth noting, although it's not definitive, that CEQA's Appendix G threshold of

24 significance Part IV.a. similarly focuses on special status species as opposed to common species."

25 72. Then, Respondent includes this chart, which does not include other special status species

26 identified in the submissions by Sierra Club and Petitioner van de Hoek:

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

75. The Palmer's Goldenbush was identified and discovered by naturalist Jonathan Coffin
2 and biologist/botanist Robert van de Hoek. At one point, Respondent calls it a "common species" -
which it is not. While not listed on the endangered species list, it is a rare species that is usually treated

4 by state botanists as one that requires protection of the habitat supporting such a species.

5 76. Respondent's response to Petitioner van de Hoek's comment about the presence of

6 Palmer's Goldenbush is reflective of many of the sloppy and inaccurate responses made in the
7 preparation of this EIR. The quote relied on by Respondent to dismiss van de Hoek's comments,

8 "someone else might have a different opinion," was made by someone a journalist spoke with, but was

9 not a statement made by van de Hoek, who is a wildlife biologist and botanist, and who was previously

10 ranked as "qualified" as such by Respondent.

11 77. CDFW is the state agency charged with protecting rare species like this, and it was
incumbent upon them to have botanist specialists come out to the site to survey or even contact Robert 12

13 van de Hoek. CDFW would instead prefer to forge ahead with this project without specialists of any
14 kind reviewing this proposed project.

15 78. The EIR also should have been recirculated for comment following newly discovered

16 nesting and breeding behavior on both sides of the Ballona Creek levees - of endangered Least Bell's

17 Vireo. The levees are planned to be demolished in these very areas where this species has been

18 documented. Erroneous flood risk standards used to design the project also became evident after the
19 draft EIR was circulated.

20 79. The US Fish & Wildlife Service Dept of Interior stated:
21 Our comments in this letter focus on the proposed project. Our primary concerns 8 8 with the proposed project are: 1) the lack of clear objectives for the restoration; 2) the large extent of temporal impacts to vegetated arcas (about 336 acres for about 10 years) relative to the gain in aquatic/wetland habitats (about 61 acres); 3) the
24 increase in habitat fragmentation associated with placement of new flood control levees/berms; 4) the increase in disturbance to wildlife associated with increased
25 recreation; and 5) uncertainty regarding the extent of maintenance required for flood control and recreation infrastructure.
26

27 In its previous comment letters, the Service stated its concerns regarding increased habitat fragmentation associated with the proposed project. In general,
28 coastal estuaries consist of a large expanse of low gradient open space that allows waterfowl and other wildlife to traverse unimpeded across the landscape and

14
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 between habitats. Currently, Area A is separated from Area B by the Ballona

2 Creek levee. The proposed project will relocate the existing levee to form a

t meander-shaped channel and introduce a new series of levees and berms to
control water flows, provide flood protection, and protect existing habitats. We

4 remain concerned that the increased fragmentation will limit wildlife movement
and subject a greater proportion of the remaining wildlife within Ballona

5 Wetlands to noise and disruption associated with recreation and maintenance

6 activities along the new berms, lowering the overall quality of remaining habitat from its current condition.

80.
7 While Respondent explains its plans further about how the increase in tides will basically

8 flood the salt panne, there is not substantial evidence or even explanation about the questions the

9 USF&WS asks about the federally endangered California Least Tern, which Petitioners provided

10 photographic evidence for breeding behavior there, or impacts to significant wintering habitat for other

11 shorebirds, waterbirds and seabirds.

81.
12 Respondent's responses to comments were also written before the discovery and

13 documentation of Least Bell's Vireo breeding and nesting behavior by this species on the north and

14 south levee areas of Ballona Creek, and yet Respondent failed to recirculate the EIR with this new

information.
15
82.
16 Respondent's response on Page 2-89 states, "The proposed restoration includes re-

17 establishing high value rare coastal habitat known to require longer restoration periods to reach full

18 function. The performance criteria used for the restoration of fish, birds, and macroinvertebrates,

19 whereby at 8-10 years post-restoration, metrics such as species richness and abundance are anticipated

20 to exceed pre-Project conditions, consistent with realistic expectations for these resource types." This is

21 a conclusion not supported by substantial evidence.

83.
22 Regarding flood risk standards, Respondent admits wrong ones were used for modeling

23 the entire proposed project, but then relies on them anyway.
84.
24 Respondent falsely states, "Corps Engineers to-date have not proposed the need for

25 additional flood protection measures at Ballona Wetlands." In reality, Respondent argued with the US

26 Army Corps of Engineers for at least two years (with funder California Coastal Conservancy staff taking

27 the lead for them) about the need to have the project designed based on the more protective flood risk

28 standards. Then the Coastal Conservancy hired a lobbyist to attempt to persuade then U.S. Senator
Kamala Harris to get Congress to approve the old (less protective) standards.

15
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

85. US Fish & Wildlife Service commented, "there is no discussion about whether there will

2 be appropriate habitat conditions within the site to support the species after restoration is completed."
86. CDFW's response on page 2-92 was, "See Response AF1-29. Regarding the first specific

4 issue in the comment, as indicated in Draft EIS/EIR Section 2.2.2.6, Alternative 1: Monitoring and
Adaptive Management, a 10-year monitoring and adaptive management program would be implemented

6 as part of the Project to help ensure Lewis' evening primrose would be replaced at a 1:1 ratio (see Draft
EIS/EIR Appendix B3 for more detail regarding adaptive management measures if performance goals
are not being met)."
87. The response does not refer to substantial evidence to back up the concerns raised by

10 USF&WS - but instead refers to adaptive management after the project is completed. USF&WS is

11 asking for assurance that appropriate habitat conditions to support the species is being considered as part

12 of the project plan, which it clearly is not. There is nothing in this EIR that explains what conditions are

13 needed by this species - cryptobiotic soils are needed for this species - which is mentioned in the letters

14 by Petitioner van de Hoek:

15 A little more about Cryptobiotic soils - clearly they do not have substantial evidence that
16 the substrate is going to be present when they would cover the habitat of the Lewis'

17 Evening Primrose - presumably they think it's as easy as growing radishes in a home vegetable garden?:
18 Cryptobiotic soil crusts are created by living organisms such as algae, cyanobacteria, and
19 fungi. The bacteria within the soil release a gelatinous material that binds soil particles

20 together in a dense matrix. The result is a hardened surface layer made up of both living organisms and inorganic soil matter.
21 https://www.nps.gov/glca/learn/nature/soils.htm
22

23 Impacted areas may never fully recover. Under the best circumstances, a thin veneer of biological soil may return in five to seven years. Mature crusts can take 50 years to
24 strengthen. Lichens and mosses may take hundreds of years to recover.

25 https://www.nps.gov/articles/seug-soil-crust.htm

26 88. There is also no substantial evidence in the record to support the use of pesticides and

27 poisons, which the project calls for.

28 89. There is also no substantial evidence in the record to support forcing bicyclists to undergo

16

- time-consuming detours on meandering trails instead of the current direct paths for commuting, the

2 carbon impacts of which is also not addressed, as it will increase reliance on driving.

3 90. Thus, Respondent violated its duties to certify an EIR and adopt findings conforming to

4 the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. Accordingly, certification of the EIR must be set

5 aside.

6 91. Respondent is also threatening to proceed with piecemeal implementation of the project.
7 Implementation of the project will irreparably harm the environment in that the unaddressed significant
impacts described above will occur. A temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent

9 injunctions should issue restraining Respondent from proceeding with the project.

10 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

11 Wherefore, Plaintiffs pray for judgment against Defendants as follows:

12 1. For a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction restraining Defendants,

13 Respondents, and Real Parties in Interest from taking any action to carry out the project pending trial.

14 2. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing:

15 (a) Respondent to vacate and set aside its certification of the EIR for the project.
16 (b) Respondent to suspend all activity under the certification and project approval that

17 could result in any change or alteration in the physical environment until respondent has

18 taken actions that may be necessary to bring the project into compliance with CEQA.

19 (c) Respondent to prepare, circulate, and consider a new and legally adequate EIR and

20 otherwise to comply with CEQA in any subsequent action taken to approve the project.

21 3. For reasonable attorneys' fees as provided by, inter alia, Code Civ. Proc. § 1021.5, and

22 for costs of suit incurred herein; and

23 4. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
