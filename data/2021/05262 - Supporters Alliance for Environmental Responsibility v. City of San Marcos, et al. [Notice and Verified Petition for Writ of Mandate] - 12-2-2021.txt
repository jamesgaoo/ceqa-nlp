VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- INTRODUCTION

2 1.

3 This action challenges the certification by the City Council of the City of San Marcos,

4 and the City of San Marcos (collectively "San Marcos," "City," or "Respondents") of an Initial Study
and Mitigated Negative Declarationand approval of a Tentative Parcel Map, and a Mitigation
5 Monitoring & Reporting Program in reliance thereon-without the proper level of environmental

6 review of potentially significant adverse impacts. San Marcos has failed to

7 prepare an EIR

8 (Environmental Impact Report) for the Diamond Street Industrial Project ("Project"), despite

9 overwhelming expert opinion that the Project may have potentially significant adverse air quality

10 impacts, diesel particulate matter impacts, greenhouse gas impacts, and biological resource impacts,

11 and that the significance of these impacts will not be reduced to insignificance by the Project's
proposed mitigation measures.

12 2.

13 The Project is immediately adjacent to the residential neighborhood of Questhaven/La

14 Costa Meadows Neighborhood to the west. Experts calculated that construction of the Project will

expose

15 these nearby residents to cancer risks from diesel particulate matter (DPM) over five times

16 above the CEQA significance threshold. Because the City failed to prepare an EIR, the City failed to

17 analyze and impose feasible mitigation measures to reduce this impact.

3.

18 The Project is adjacent to designated open space managed by the Center for Natural

19 Lands Management to the northwest, east and southeast. The Project site includes 22.89 acres

20 covered with coastal sage scrub. The Project site provides valuable habitat to dozens of special-status

21 species, including the federally threatened California Gnatcatcher, the San Diegan Tiger Whiptail,

22 Olive-sided Flycatcher, Cooper's Hawk and many other special-status species. A nesting pair of

23 California Gnatcatchers has been positively identified on the Project site. Site grading to construct the

24 building pad will destroy this valuable habitat. Because the City failed to prepare an EIR, it failed to

25 analyze these impacts, failed to impose feasible mitigation measures, and failed to consider feasible

alternatives.

26 4.

27 The Project was improperly piecemealed. The IS/MND described the Project as a

28 consolidation of lots and grading of a parcel for an industrial pad and made clear that there will be an
industrial building placed there in the future. The area is zoned for Light Industrial uses. However,

2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 there is no discussion of the potential environmental impacts that the future industrial building will

2 cause. The City may not improperly piecemeal the Project in order to evade review under CEQA.

3 5. Project construction and operation may also result in potentially significant adverse

4 biological resource impacts, including the disruption and loss of habitat of special-status species and

5 cumulative impacts on wildlife. The IS/MND failed to adequately mitigate the Project's impact on

6 these biological resources.

7 6. Expert wildlife biologist Shawn Smallwood, Ph.D. detected the presence of 49

8 vertebrate species of wildlife on the project site, 13 of which were special-status species. The

9 IS/MND in contrast estimated that only three special-status species had a high potential to occur on

10 the Project site. The biologists that surveyed the site for the IS/MND found only 16 specics on site,

11 none of which were special-status, rendering the IS/MND inadequate as an informational document

12 since the environmental setting description is inaccurate.

13 7. Project construction and operation may result in potentially significant air quality,

14 diesel particulate matter, and greenhouse gas impacts. The IS/MND relied on unsubstantiated input

15 parameters to estimate Project emissions, thus underestimating emissions. An air quality model
16 analysis concluded that the whole project will have potentially significant air quality impacts that

17 were not disclosed or mitigated in the IS/MND. Well-qualified experts calculated that diesel

18 particulate matter emissions of the whole project have not been adequately addressed, and models

19 indicate that infant, children, and lifetime cancer risks exceed the San Diego Air Pollution Control

20 District ("SDAPCD") threshold of 10 in one million by over five times. Lastly, a screening-level

21 assessment of greenhouse gas emissions associated with the whole Project showed that GHG

22 emissions will exceed City thresholds. These impacts were not assessed nor mitigated in the

23 IS/MND.

24 8. San Marcos's certification of a Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project violates

25 the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq.,

26 and the CEQA Guidelines, California Code of Regulations, Title 14, section 15000 et seq. as there

27 was substantial evidence before San Marcos that the Project may have potentially significant adverse

28 air quality, diesel particulate matter, greenhouse gas, and biological resource impacts that will not be

3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

l reduced to less than significant by the proposed mitigation measures.

2 9. San Marcos prejudicially abused its discretion by failing to proceed in a manner

3 required by law, and these violations of law precluded informed public participation and informed

4 decision making.

5 10. This is also an action for appropriate injunctive relief in the event that Respondents

6 proceed to implement their decisions and approvals described herein prior to the final resolution of

7 this action.

8 11. San Marcos's violations of CEQA, and approval of the Project based thereon, will

9 harm Petitioner, its members and the public environmental values will be degraded without the

10 required level of environmental review.

11 PARTIES

12 Petitioner

13 12. Petitioner SUPPORTERS ALLIANCE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

14 RESPONSIBILITY ("SAFER") is a California not-for-profit corporation, with members who live,

15 work, and/or recreate near the Project site and in the City of San Marcos. SAFER is concerned about

16 the approval of the Diamond Street Industrial Project which is woefully inadequate in its

17 consideration of environmental impacts and may jeopardize the integrity of the natural environment

18 and wildlife on the Project site.

19 13. SAFER participated in the administrative proceedings by inter alia submitting written

20 and verbal comments on the Project, including inter alia San Marcos's violations of CEQA. SAFER

21 brings this action on behalf of itself, its adversely affected members and the public at large.

22 14. Petitioner has direct and beneficial interest in San Marcos's compliance with CEQA

23 and the CEQA Guidelines. Petitioner and its members are interested in making sure that the Project is

24 approved in a way that protects the environment and its resources. That interest has been and will

25 continue to be directly and adversely affected by San Marcos's actions challenged herein, which

26 actions violate provisions of law set forth in this Petition, precluded informed public participation,
27 and would cause substantial harm to the environment. Petitioner will suffer concrete, actual and

28 imminent injury from San Marcos's prejudicial abuse of discretion as well as from implementation of

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 the proposed Project without full CEQA compliance.

2 Respondents

3 15. Respondent CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SAN MARCOS "CITY

4 COUNCIL") is the decision-making body of the CITY OF SAN MARCOS. On October 27, 2021,

5 the CITY COUNCIL approved the adoption of the Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration, and

6 Tentative Parcel Map for the Project.

7 16. Respondent the CITY OF SAN MARCOS (SAN MARCOS") is, and at all times

8 herein mentioned was, a duly organized governmental entity organized under the Constitution and

9 Laws of the State of California. It is responsible, inter alia, for complying with the Constitution of

10 the State of California and for implementing the laws of the State of California, including CEQA and

11 the CEQA Guidelines. SAN MARCOS issued the Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration;

12 responded to comments thereon; certified the Mitigated Negative Declaration; approved the Tentative

13 Parcel Map in reliance thereon; and issued the Notice of Determination for the Project.

14 17. The Notice of Determination filed by the City of San Marcos identifies "JEFF JENCO

15 DIAMOND STREET INDUSTRIAL, LLC/ MDLV INVESTMENTS, LLC/ DIAMOND ROSE,

16 LLC" as the "Project Applicant." Cal. Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5(a) requires that a

17 petitioner "shall name, as a real party in interest, the person or persons identified by the public agency

18 in its notice. . .." Cal. Pub. Res. Code §21167.5. For this reason, Petitioner names JEFF JENCO,
19 I DIAMOND STREET INDUSTRIAL, LLC, MDLV INVESTMENTS, LLC, and DIAMOND ROSE,

20 LLC as Real Parties in Interest.

21

22 STATEMENT OF FACTS

23 The Project and its Environmental Setting

24 18. The proposed Diamond Street Industrial Project would include consolidation of a

25 22.89-acre site and the mass grading of 16.12 of those acres. The Project is proposed to be located in
26 the Questhaven/La Costa Meadows Neighborhood of the City of San Marcos in North San Diego

27 County at APNs 223-341-03 to -14 and -16.

28 19. Despite the debris dumped long-ago on the site and transmission lines that span the

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 western edge of the site, its flora is diverse and a dirt road beneath the transmission lines and

2 pedestrian trails are used by hikers and mountain bikers. The Project site lies about 0.5 miles

3 southwest of Lake San Marcos and west of San Marcos Creek.

4 20. The Project site is rich with wildlife species and has a ratio of non-native to native

5 species of only two percent. It is highly productive and contains numerous foraging birds, birds

6 expressing breeding-territorial behavior, and fledglings.

7 21. The Project site contains the presence of the California Gnatcatcher, as confirmed by

8 the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, who observed a breeding pair of Gnatcatchers on the

9 site. California Gnatcatchers are a federally threatened species.

10 22. The Project proposes to mass grade 16.12 acres of the parcel, which may include

11 blasting due to granitic bedrock conditions in some areas of the site. Other project components

12 include: construction of a private unpaved driveway, construction of retaining walls ranging from one

13 to 20 feet in height, installation of water and sewer lines, construction of a water quality basin,

14 construction of a desiltation basin, and installation of landscaping.

15 San Marcos Review, Expert Comment and Project Approval

16 23. On April 13, 2020, the City of San Marcos received an application from Diamond

17 Street Industrial, LLC/ MDLV Investments, LLC/ Diamond Rose, LLC requesting a Tentative Parcel

18 Map ("TPM") to consolidate 13 industrial lots to two parcels, and grading and related improvements

19 to construct a buildable pad on the Project site.

20 24. In April 2021, the City prepared its Initial Study and Notice of Intent to Adopt a

21 Mitigated Negative Declaration. On September 2, 2021, the City issued its Final Initial Study/

22 Mitigated Negative Declaration. On September 27, 2021, the City Engineer of the City of San
23 Marcos reviewed the TPM and made an administrative final decision to conditionally approve the
24 TPM.

25 25. SAFER filed a written comment letter to the City during the MND comment period

26 objecting to the Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project and requesting an Environmental
27 Impact Report to analyze and mitigate the Project's impacts and to consider alternatives with reduced

28 environmental impacts.

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 26. Following approval of the TPM, SAFER timely filed an appeal of the Project with the

2 City Council, which was heard on October 26, 2021.

3 27. Matt Hagemann, P.G., C.Hg., and Dr. Paul E. Rosenfeld, Ph.D. of the environmental

4 consulting firm Soil/Water/Air Protection Enterprise ("SWAPE") submitted written expert comments

5 that the Project was improperly piecemealed, and that the IS/MND therefore failed to consider

6 impacts of the future planned industrial building. SWAPE a found that a future industrial building on

7 the proposed industrial pad may have significant adverse environmental impacts from air quality

8 impacts, diesel particulate matter emissions, and greenhouse gas impacts, and that those impacts must

9 be analyzed concurrently with the analysis of the proposed concrete pad.

10 28. Dr. Shawn Smallwood, Ph.D. submitted written expert comments that the Project will

11 result in potentially significant adverse biological impacts, even with implementation of the proposed

12 mitigation measures. Dr. Smallwood concluded that the IS/MND fails as an informational document

13 because of its (1) inadequate characterization of the environmental setting as it relates to wildlife, (2)

14 failure to complete full analysis of the degree of habitat loss on the Project site, (3) flawed analysis of

15 the Project's interference with wildlife movement, (4) failure to analyze potential impacts of

16 increased traffic and associated vehicle collision mortalities on wildlife in the area, and (5) failure to

17 analyze potential cumulative impacts of past, ongoing, and future projects on wildlife. Dr. Smallwood

18 noted that biological impacts would occur as a result of the building of the concrete pad, regardless of

19 the nature of any future construction of an industrial building.

20 29. Despite these expert comments, on October 26, 2021, the San Marcos City Council

21 approved the TPM and the IS/MND prepared for the Project and refused to require preparation of an

22 EIR to analyze and mitigate the Project's environmental impacts. In so doing, the City Council failed

23 to proceed in the manner required by law.

24 30. On October 27, 2021, San Diego County filed San Marcos's Notice of Determination

25 for the Project.

26 PROCEDURAL ALLEGATIONS

27 31. Petitioner, through its representatives and members, has performed any and all

28 conditions precedent to filing the instant action and has exhausted any and all available

7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1  administrative remedies to the extent required by law, inter alia, submitting written and oral

2 comments on the Project and its environmental review during the administrative process.

3 32. Petitioner timely raised each and every significant substantive and procedural issue

4 known to them in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21177 during the review process

5 for this Project. Petitioner requested that Respondents refrain from approving the Initial Study/

6 Mitigated Negative Declaration based on its CEQA violations. Petitioner requested that Respondents

7 refrain from approving this Project until Respondents fully comply with CEQA, including requiring

8 preparation of an EIR to analyze and mitigate the Project's environmental impacts. Any further

9 exhaustion would be futile.

10 33. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

11 21167.5 by mailing a written notice of the commencement of this action to Respondents prior to

12 filing this petition. A copy of the prior written notice provided to Respondents, with proof of service

13 thereof, is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

14 34. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by filing a

15 Notice of Intent to Prepare the Administrative Record at the time of filing this Petition. A copy of the

16 Notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.

17 35. Petitioner will comply with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
18 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by mailing a copy of the Petition to the California

19 Attorney General within the required time period.

20 36. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
21 sections 1085 (traditional mandate), and 1094.5 (administrative mandate); and Public Resources

22 Code sections 21168 and 21168.5 (California Environmental Quality Act).
23 37. Venue is proper in the California Superior Court for the County of San Diego pursuant
24 to Code of Civil Procedure section 395 because San Marcos is located within San Diego County, the

25 Project site is located in San Diego County and because the actions complained of herein occurred

26 within San Diego County.

27 38. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law

28 unless this Court enjoins and mandates that Respondents comply with their duties and set aside the

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 approval of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approvals will remain in

2 effect in violation of CEQA.

3 39. If Respondents and Real Parties and their agents are not enjoined from implementing

4 the Project, and from undertaking acts in furtherance thereof, Petitioner will suffer irreparable harm

5 from which there is no adequate remedy at law in that the Project area and surrounding areas would

6 be irrevocably altered and significant unmitigated adverse environmental impacts would occur.

7 Petitioner and the general public have also been harmed by Respondents' failure to prepare an EIR

8 for this Project.

9 40. In pursuing this action, which involves enforcement of important rights affecting the

10 public interest, Petitioner will confer a substantial benefit on the general public and citizens of the

11 City of San Marcos, San Diego County, and the State of California, and therefore will be entitled to

12 attorney's fees and costs pursuant to, inter alia, Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

13 41. This petition is timely filed within all applicable statutes of limitations.

14 42. Petitioner brings this action pursuant to Public Resources Code sections 21168 and

15 21168.5 and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5 which require that an agency's

16 approval of a Project be set aside if the agency has prejudicially abused its discretion. Respondents

17 have prejudicially abused their discretion because Respondents have failed to proceed according to

18 the law, and their decision is not supported by substantial evidence, and Respondents have failed to

19 make proper and adequate findings.

20 STATEMENT OF LAW

21 CEQA

22 43. CEQA is an integral part of every public agency's decision-making process. (Pub.

23 Res. Code cor 21006.) CEQA was enacted to protect the environment by the establishment of

24 administrative procedures to ensure that long-term protection of the environment shall be the guiding

25 criterion in public decisions.

26 44. The purpose of an EIR is to provide public agencies and the public with "detailed

27 information" about the likely significant environmental effect of a proposed project and ways in

28 which the significant effects might be minimized. (§ 21061; see § 21002.1, subd. (a).) An EIR serves

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

not only to protect the environment but also to demonstrate to an apprehensive public that it is being

2 protected. (CEQA Guideline § 15003, subd. (b).)

3 45. All public agencies must prepare, or cause to be prepared, and certify the completion

4 of an EIR on any project which they propose to carry out that may have a significant effect on the

5 environment. (Pub. Res. Code §Ç 21100(a), 21151(a).) A significant effect is a "potentially

6 substantial, adverse change." (Pub. Res. § Code § 21068.) This means that an activity has a significant

7 effect if it "has the potential to degrade the quality of the environment." (Pub. Res. Code § 21083; 14

8 § C.C.R. § 15065.)

46. An EIR must be prepared where "there is substantial evidence, in light of the whole
10 record before the agency, that the project may have a significant effect on the environment." (Pub.

11 Res. Code § 21080(d).) If there is substantial evidence supporting a "fair argument" that a project

12 "may" have a significant environmental effect, the agency "shall" prepare an EIR. (CEQA Guideline

13 15064(a)(1).) The fair argument standard provides a "low threshold" for requiring the preparation of

14 an EIR, with a preference for resolving doubts in favor of an EIR.

15 47. "Substantial evidence" is "enough relevant information and reasonable inferences

16 from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion, even though other

17 conclusions might also be reached." (CEQA Guideline 15384(a).) Substantial evidence includes fact,

18 a reasonable assumption predicated upon fact, or expert opinion supported by fact. (Pub. Res. Code §
19 21080(e)(1).) Where some experts conclude there may be a potentially adverse impact, and other

20 experts disagree, an EIR must still be prepared. (CEQA Guidelines 15064, subd. (g).)

21 48. All phases of project planning, implementation, and operation must be considered in

22 an Initial Study. (CEQA Guideline 15063(a)(1).)

23 49. To identify potentially significant adverse environmental effects of a project, an initial

24 study must delineate environmental conditions prevailing absent the project, defining a baseline a of

25 existing physical conditions in the affected area.

26 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION FOR VIOLATION OF CEQA
27 (Pub. Res. Code, § 21000 et seq.)

28 50. Petitioner incorporates by reference herein the preceding paragraphs, as if fully set

10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 forth.

2 Claim One - Failure to Prepare an Environmental Impact Report Despite Substantial Evidence

3 of Potentially Significant Adverse Impacts

4 51. There was substantial evidence, in light of the whole record before the City Council of

5 the City of San Marcos at the time of its decision, that the Project may have potentially significant air

6 quality, diesel particulate matter, greenhouse gas, and biological resource impacts, and that these

7 significant impacts will not be reduced by proposed mitigation measures to a less than significant

8 level. Specifically, there was substantial evidence in the form of facts, reasonable assumptions
9| predicated upon facts, and expert opinion supported by facts that the Project may have these

10 potentially significant adverse impacts.

11 52. There was substantial evidence that the mitigation measures adopted by the City are

12 insufficient to reduce the Project's significant adverse environmental impacts to a less than

13 significant level.
53. By failing to prepare an EIR, in light of the substantial evidence of potentially
14

15 significant adverse impacts which will not be reduced by proposed mitigations, San Marcos failed to

16 proceed in a manner required by law, failed to comply with CEQA and prejudicially abused its

17 discretion.

18 Claim Two - Improper Piecemealing of Project Elements in Violation of CEOA

19 54. The proposed Project is improperly piecemealed in violation of CEQA. See CEQA
20 Guidelines § 15378(a). The Project is described as a consolidation of lots and grading of a parcel for
21 an industrial pad for a future industrial building on the parcel. Project proponents claim not to know
22

23 enough about the future industrial building to assess it under CEQA. However, details of the size of

24 the lot, the size and location of the slope, the driveway, the retaining walls, water and sewer line

25 connections, and landscaping are all proposed with the current project. Under CEQA case law, this is

26 sufficient information to have a reasonably foreseeable projection of what the future Project will be.

27 55. By failing to consider the potential impacts of the Project as a whole, San Marcos
28

11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

failed to proceed a in a manner required by law, failed to comply with CEQA, and prejudicially abused

2 its discretion.

3 Claim Three - Failure to Properly Analyze Project Air Quality, Diesel Particulate Matter, and
Greenhouse Gas Impacts
4
56. The Initial Study's air quality impacts analysis used unsubstantiated input parameters
5
and therefore underestimated the Project's construction and operational emissions. The emissions
6
estimated by the IS/MND therefore cannot be relied upon to determine the significance of the
7
Project's air quality impacts.
8
57. The Initial Study failed to conduct a quantified construction or operational health risk
analysis of the entire Project, including future industrial development on the proposed concrete pad,
10
resulting in an inadequate health risk emissions analysis.
11
58. The Initial Study violated CEQA by failing to adequately address air quality impacts
12
of the industrial pad grading, and by failing to address the air quality, diesel particulate matter, and
13 greenhouse gas impacts from the future industrial building that will be placed on the industrial pad. 14 See CEQA Guidelines § 15065(a).
15
59. By certifying a Mitigated Negative Declaration based on a legally inadequate Initial 16
Study, San Marcos failed to comply with CEQA and prejudicially abused its discretion.
17

18 Claim Four - Failure to Properly Analyze Biological Resource Impacts
19 60. The Initial Study's biological resources analysis fails to give a clear baseline, by
20 failing to adequately characterize the existing environmental setting as it relates to the species of
21 wildlife present and potentially present on the Project site. This lack of a clear baseline is a violation
22 of CEQA's "baseline assumption" requirements and therefore does not allow the public to fully
23 assess potential impacts of the Project. See, Communities for a Better Envt. v. So. Coast Air Qual.
24 Mgmt. Dist. (2010) 48 Cal. 4th 310, 321; San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center, 149 Cal.App.4th 645,
25 656; Woodward Park Homeowners, 150 Cal.App.4th 683, 708-711. San Marcos's certification of the
26 Mitigated Negative Declaration without this analysis violates CEQA.
27

28

12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 61. The Initial Study also violated CEQA by failing to complete a full analysis of the

2 degree of habitat loss that would occur on the Project site. See CEQA Guidelines 15065(a).

3 62. The Initial Study also violated CEQA by failing to address the cumulative impacts

4 from loss of habitat and other potential disturbances caused by the Project. See CEQA Guidelines ccp

5 15065(a).

6 63. By certifying a Mitigated Negative Declaration based on a legally inadequate Initial

7 Study, San Marcos failed to proceed in a manner required by law, failed to comply with CEQA and

8 prejudicially abused its discretion.

9

10 Claim Five - Failure to Address Potentially Significant Habitat Loss and Fragmentation
11 Impacts Caused by the Project

12 64. The Initial Study failed to address the significant habitat loss and fragmentation

13 impacts that could be caused by the presence of the Project on the site. Specifically, it did not analyze

14 or attempt to mitigate the loss of bird nests or reproductive capacity of birds. There is a trend in North

15 America of a decline in birds, and that trend would be further exacerbated by this Project. This

16 provides substantial evidence of a fair argument that the impact from the Project may be significant,

17 and the City's failure to prepare an EIR based on this violated CEQA.

18 65. By certifying a Mitigated Negative Declaration based on a legally inadequate Initial

19 Study, San Marcos failed to proceed in a manner required by law, failed to comply with CEQA and

20 prejudicially abused its discretion.

21 Claim Six Designation of an Arbitrary Wildlife Corridor and Subsequent Erroneous
22 Conclusion that Project will Not Impact Wildlife Movement

23 66. The Initial Study arbitrarily designated a portion of the Project site as a wildlife

24 corridor, as there was no distinction of the designated area as compared to the rest of the site. On the

25 contrary, the rest of the Project site that was not designated as a corridor was likely better suited as a

26 wildlife corridor. Further, the presence of a corridor does not in itself mean that there is no substantial

27 impact on wildlife. Under CEQA, the standard goes to wildlife movement regardless of whether the

28 movement is channeled by a corridor or some linkage. Again, contrary to the IS/MND's claims, the

13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 industrialization of the area surrounding the Project site means that the Project is all the more

2 important to wildlife, rather than indicating that the impact will be less than significant. This provides

3 substantial evidence of a fair argument that the impact from the Project may be significant, and the
4 City's failure to prepare an EIR violated CEQA.

5 67. By certifying a Mitigated Negative Declaration based on a legally inadequate Initial

6 Study, San Marcos failed to proceed in a manner required by law, failed to comply with CEQA and
7 prejudicially abused its discretion.

8

9 Claim Seven - Failure to Analyze Impacts of Project's Traffic on Wildlife

10 68. The Initial Study failed to analyze the impacts of the Project's traffic on wildlife,

11 including the impact of vehicles traveling to or from the Project site. As a result of the City's

12 improper piecemealing of the project, the Initial Study did not include information on Vehicle Miles

13 Travelled, and therefore did not estimate wildlife mortality from Project-generated traffic.

14 69. The wildlife fatalities that could occur due to the Project represents a substantial and

15 significant impact on wildlife that was not analyzed in the IS/MND. By certifying a Mitigated

16 Negative Declaration based on a legally inadequate Initial Study, San Marcos failed to proceed in a

17 manner required by law, failed to comply with CEQA and prejudicially abused its discretion.
