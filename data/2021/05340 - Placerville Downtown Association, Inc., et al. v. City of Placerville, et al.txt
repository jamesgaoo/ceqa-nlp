Against the City of Placerville

To the Attorney General of the State of California:

Please take notice, under Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of
Civil Procedure 388, that on February 17, 2021, Petitioners Placerville Downtown Association and Friends of Historic Hangtown (*Plaintiffs"') filed a Verified Petition for
Writ of Mandate ("the "Petition") that challenges the City's action to approve CUP 20-04
and SPR 20-04 authorizing a formula retail store, Therapy Stores, Inc. ("Project"), in the City's central business district. The lawsuit will be based on violations of the City's Municipal Code and CEQA, as discussed more fully in the Project's administrative proceedings. The exact nature of the allegations and relief sought is described in the Petition that Petitioners filed on February 17, 2021, and that is attached to this notice as

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioners PLACERVILLE DOWNTOWN ASSOCIATION, INC., and

3 FRIENDS OF HISTORIC HANGTOWN (collectively "Petitioners") petition this court for a

4 Writ of Mandate ("Petition"), directed to Respondent CITY OF PLACERVILLE ("City" or

5 "Defendant"). Petitioners challenge the City's approval of a conditional use permit ("CUP")

6 and site plan review ("SPR") for a proposed Therapy Store formula business to be located at 339

7 Main Street ("Project") in the City of Placerville's historic Central Business District ("CBD").

8 2. Recognizing that formula businesses "cannot contribute to the established

9 uniqueness of the Central Business District" in certain instances, the City in 2004 adopted
10 Ordinance 1597 to protect the City's CBD from the negative effects of formula business like the
11 Project. Among other things, Ordinance 1597 imposed the requirement for formula businesses
12 to obtain both a CUP and SPR from the City.

13 3. The City's approval of the Project was based on incorrect legal information that

14 the Project is a permitted use in the CBD. This is false.

15 4. A formula business like the Project is not a permitted use in the CBD. Rather, the
16 Project is a conditionally permitted use. As such, the City maintains discretionary authority to
17 approve or deny a CUP for a formula business in the CBD based on broad general welfare
18 considerations. By abdicating its duty to exercise this authority, the City fails to "reinforc[e] the

19 Central Business District as the icon of the community."
20 5. The City also violated the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") by
21 approving the Project based on inapplicable exemptions from CEQA review. These exemptions

22 are inapplicable because expert testimony demonstrated, unsurprisingly, that the proposed
23 Project, unquestionably a formula business, may result in urban decay in the CBD.
24 6. Petitioners seek a peremptory writ of mandate invalidating the City's approval of
25 the Project since, as more fully set forth below, the City has violated its own Zoning Code as

26 well as CEQA by approving the Project that would threaten the unique character of Placerville's
27 CBD zone.

2 7. Petitioner PLACERVILLE DOWNTOWN ASSOCIATION, INC., a California

3 nonprofit Corporation, is a membership organization which works to promote and protect the

4 unique and historic character of the CBD in order to maintain the common interests of its

5 members.

6 8. Petitioner FRIENDS OF HISTORIC HANGTOWN is an unincorporated
7 association of Placerville residents, business owners, and property owners concerned about
8 preserving the City's character.

9 9. Respondent CITY OF PLACERVILLE is a municipal corporation, organized

10 under the laws of the state of California, and exercising local government power including, in

11 particular, land use approval authority over the Project.

12 10. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents DOES 1
13 through 10, and sue such respondents by fictitious names. Petitioners are informed and believe,

14 and on the basis of such information and belief allege, that the fictitiously named respondents
15 are also responsible for the actions described in this Petition. When the true identities and

16 capacities of these respondents have been determined, Petitioners will amend this Petition, with

17 leave of court if necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.

18 11. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that JING CHEN AND

19 WAYNE WHELAN, individuals, are Real Parties in Interest because they are identified as the
20 applicants in the City's notice of exemption for the Project.

21 12. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest,

22 DOES 11 through 20, and sue such real parties in interest by fictitious names. Petitioners are

23 informed and believe, and on the basis of such information and belief allege, that the fictitiously

24 named Real Parties are also directly and materially affected by the actions described in this

25 Petition. When the true identities and capacities of these Real Parties have been determined,
26 Petitioners will amend this Petition, with leave of court if necessary, to insert such identities and

P BACKGROUND FACTS

2 13.

3 14. The Project would be located at 339 Main Street in the City's CBD zone.

4 The CBD zone was established by the City to, in part, "Protect the downtown area

5 from encroachment by unrelated and incompatible uses," and "Differentiate the downtown area

6 from all other land use designations because of its unique character."
15.

7 In 2004, the City adopted Ordinance 1597 to address the concern that certain

8 formula businesses "cannot contribute to the established uniqueness of the Central Business
District."

9 16.

10 Among other things, Ordinance 1597 expressly designated formula businesses as

11 "conditional uses" and not permitted uses. Accordingly, Ordinance 1597 imposed the

12 requirement for "formula businesses" obtain both a conditional use permit ("CUP") and site plan

13 review ("SPR") within the City's historic Central Business District ("CBD").
17.

14 Ordinance 1597 defines a "formula business" as any business with a proposed or

15 existing exterior design (appearance, colors, signage) that is essentially identical to five (5) or

16 more other business sites using the same or similar name or identity." The Project is a "formula

17 business" as that use is defined by the City. On information and belief, there are currently

18 eleven Therapy Stores operating, and the proposed Project would be the 12th store.
18.

19 On information and belief, Real Parties acquired possessory interest of 339 Main

20 Street on or about September 29, 2020, and submitted their application for a CUP and SPR on
October 8, 2020.

21 19. Despite not requiring an Environmental Assessment in violation of the City's own
22 Development Guide and Environmental Impact Report Guidelines, City staff nevertheless
23

24 submitted the application for approval by the City's Planning Commission at its meeting on

25 November 3, 2020 with a recommendation of approval and finding that the Project is exempt

26 from CEQA review under the so-called "common sense exemption."

20.

27 Petitioner PDA raised concerns about the negative impact of a formula business on

28 the CBD, and asked the City to study the issue before taking action.

SOLURI
MESERVE
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 '21. The Planning Commission continued its hearing on the Project until November 17,
2 2020. Prior to that hearing, Petitioner submitted expert testimony by economist Dr. Philip King

3 on the issue of the Project's potential to harm the CBD. Dr. King opined, "I believe there is a

4 serious and significant possibility that the proposed Therapy store in downtown Placerville

5 would create urban decay in the downtown due to the closure of several local businesses,

6 identified above."

7 22. The Planning Commission continued its hearing on the Project until December 1,

8 2020, at which time it approved the Project. The Planning Commission's decision was not
9 informed by any analysis of urban decay in the CBD as requested. Instead, it purported to make
10 conclusory and unsupported "findings" that Dr. King's testimony was somehow not credible.

11 23. Petitioners PDA and FOHH filed a timely administrative appeal of the Planning

12 Commission's action on December 10, 2020.

13 24. The City scheduled its appeal hearing on January 11, 2021. On January 7, 2021,
14 just a few days before the Council hearing, the City released a report purporting to address
15 potential urban decay impacts from the Project. While attempting to refute Dr. King's analysis,

16 the City's report actually supported the Project's potential for urban decay by basing its
17 conclusions on application of de facto mitigation measures designed to avoid the Project's

18 impact in the CBD.

19 25. The City conducted its hearing on Petitioners' administrative appeal on January
20 11, 2021. During that hearing, City staff repeatedly and unambiguously mischaracterized the

21 Project as a "permitted use" in the CBD. Staff doubled down on this mischaracterization by

22 asserting that proper City considerations include only what the Project "looks like" and "how to

23 operate," and does not consider whether the Project as a land use should be denied in the CBD.

24 26. As a result of staff's presentation, the City Council was led to believe that its
25 authority to deny the requested CUP was very narrow or even non-existent

26 27. Later in the hearing, one Councilmember raised a concern that issuing a CUP for
27 one formula business would open up the door to other formula businesses at that location since

28 CUPs run with the land. Staff again misled the Council by stating that the Project's CUP would

SOLURI
MESERVE 5
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 not run with the land. Staff's statement is incorrect because "a CUP runs with the land."

2 (California Charter Schools Assn. v. City of Huntington Park (2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 362, 371.)

3 Staff purported to support its misrepresentation by reference to section 10-4-9 (C)(10), but that

4 provision concerns site plan review and not conditional use permits.

5 28. The Council's decision was therefore prejudiced by the incorrect legal information

6 that the formula business CUP could not be transferred to another formula business at that

7 location.

8 29. At the end of the meeting on January 11, 2021, the City approved CUP 20-04 and

9 SPR 20-04 authorizing the Project, which constituted final agency action.

10 30. On January 13, 2021, the City filed its notice of exemption for the Project.

11 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

12 31. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to
13 Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code sections 21168.

14 32. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the County of El
15 Dorado pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394.

16 33. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section

17 21167, subdivision (d). The City filed its notice of exemption for the Project on January 13,

18 2021, thereby triggering a 35-day statute of limitations.

19 STANDING

20 34. Petitioners PDA and FOHH both have standing to assert the claims alleged in this

21 Petition because they are beneficially interested in this matter, as required by Code of Civil
22 Procedure section 1086. Petitioners have standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition

23 because members of FOHH and PDA include residents, business owners and property owners
24 within the City of Placerville and its unique and historic central business district, and have

25 personal and community interests that are directly and adversely affected by the City's approval

26 of the Project. Petitioners are within the class of persons beneficially interested in, and

27 aggrieved by, the acts of Respondent as alleged below. Petitioners and their members have a

28 beneficial interest in challenging the City's unlawful approval of the Project that will negatively

SOLURI
MESERVE 6
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

impact the unique and historic character of the City's CBD.

2 35. The City's approval of the Project is also a matter of public interest. The City of

3 Placerville has a duty to implement its Zoning Code - and in particular City Ordinance 1597

4 that is designed to protect the City's CBD from formula businesses that "cannot contribute to

5 the established uniqueness of the Central Business District." Petitioners and their members

6 participated in the administrative processes herein, and exhausted their remedies. Accordingly,

7 Petitioners have standing to sue.

8 IRREPARABLE HARM

9 36. The City's failures, set forth in this Petition, constitute a prejudicial abuse of
10 discretion within the meaning of the Code Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and CEQA. (See

11 Code Civ. Proc., §1094.5; Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168.)

12 37. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of
13 law. If the City's actions regarding the Project are effectuated, Petitioners and the community
14 will be irreparably harmed. No money damages could adequately compensate for that harm.
15 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

16 38. Petitioners bring this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil

17 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights
18 affecting the public interest.

19 39. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit on

20 the general public by requiring the City to comply with CEQA and its Zoning Code when
21 making land use decisions.

22 40. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will also result in the enforcement

23 of important rights affecting the public interest by requiring the City to comply with CEQA and

24 its Zoning Code and thereby protect the character of the City's unique and historic CBD.
25 NOTICE OF CEQA SUIT

26 41. On February 16, 2021, Petitioner served a notice of Petitioners' intent to file this

27 lawsuit, pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5. (See Exhibit A, Notice of
28 Commencement of Action against the City of Placerville.)

5 election, gather and transmit its administrative files to Petitioners for preparation of the

6 administrative record.

7 First Cause of Action Against Respondent, Does 1 through 10;

8 And Real Parties in Interest and Does 11 through 20

9 For Failure to Proceed in a Manner Required by the Law

10 44. Petitioners incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in

11 Paragraphs 1 through 43 as though fully set forth herein.
12 45. An agency fails to proceed in a manner required by law when it relies on incorrect
13 legal information and misapplies governing legal authority for a land use decision. (William S.

14 Hart Union High Sch. Dist. V. Regional Planning Comm'n (1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1612, 1627.)
15 46. The City misapplied its own municipal code and California land use law when it

16 approved the Project's CUP and SPD.

17 a. The City's decision to approve the CUP was based on the incorrect legal
18 position that the Project is a permitted use in the CBD zone. In fact, the Project, as a

19 formula business, is a conditionally permitted use in the CBD zone and therefore subject
20 to approval or denial based on the broad considerations of public health and welfare.

21 b. The City's decision to approve the CUP was based on the incorrect legal
22 position that the Project's CUP would not run with the land. In fact, the law is well

23 settled that conditional use permits do run with the land. (California Charter Schools
24 Assn. V. City of Huntington Park (2019) 35 Cal.App.5th 362, 371.)
25 C. The City's decision to approve the CUP was based on the incorrect legal
26 position that the City's consideration of the CUP was limited to ensuring that the City
27 was satisfied with the formula business's appearance and how it operated, and did not

MESERVE 8

-

2 include consideration of the underlying question of whether a formula business should be
denied as an inappropriate use at its location in the CBD.

3 47.

4 Because the City received incorrect legal information and misapplication of the

5 governing legal authority from staff at the public hearing, the City did not adequately consider
this information in its deliberation on whether to issue the CUP.

6 48.

7 As a result of its misapplication governing legal authority, the City failed to
proceed in a manner required by law.

8 Second Cause of Action Against Respondent, Does through 10;

9 And Real Parties in Interest and Does 11 through 20

10 For Violations of CEQA

11 49. Petitioners incorporate by reference each and
12 Paragraphs 1 through 48 as though fully set forth herein. every allegation contained in

13 50.

14 The City did not perform environmental review for the Project pursuant to

15 CEQA. Instead, the City found the Project exempt from CEQA review pursuant to the so-
called "common sense exemption, the "existing facilities" categorical exemption, and the "infill
16 development" categorical exemption. By relying on these exemptions, the City failed to

17 proceed in a manner required by law.

18 51.

19 The "common sense exemption" that applies only where "it can be seen with

20 certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on

21 the environment." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15061, subd. (b)(3).) "Whether a particular activity

22 qualifies for the common sense exemption presents an issue of fact, and the agency invoking

23 the exemption has the burden of demonstrating that it applies." (Muzzy Ranch Co. V. Solano
County Airport Land Use Commission (2007) 41 Cal.4th 372, 386.)

24 52.

25 Similarly, categorical exemptions are subject to exceptions under which reliance

26 on an exemption is improper. (CEQA Guidelines, §15300.2.) For example, an exemption may

27 not be relied on when there is a "reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant

28 effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15300.2, subd.
(c); see, e.g., Voices for Rural Living v. El Dorado Irrigation District (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th

-,'

1

2 1096, 1109 (due to "unusual circumstances" delivery of water to a casino through an existing

3 pipeline had a potentially significant effect, thereby precluding reliance on an exemption).)
53.

4 The Project would be located in the City' CBD, an area of the City long-

5 recognized for its unusual historical character. Substantial evidence in the form of Dr. Philip

6 King's testimony demonstrated a fair argument that the Project would result in significant
urban decay impacts in the City's CBD.

7 54.

8 The City attempted to contradict Dr. King's expert testimony with a competing
urban decay report. The City's report failed to demonstrate that Dr. King's findings were not
9 substantial evidence, and actually supported the argument for a potentially significant urban
10

11 decay impact concluding that mitigation measures were necessary to avoid urban decay impacts

12 in the CBD. A lead agency may not rely on mitigation to qualify for a categorical exemption.

13 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4, subd. (a)(1)(A)); Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v.
County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098.)

14 55.

15 The City prejudicially abused its discretion by exempting the Project from
environmental review under CEQA.
