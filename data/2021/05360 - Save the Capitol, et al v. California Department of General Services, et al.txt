Petition for Writ of Mandamus

4 Petitioner alleges:

5 Introduction

6 1. Petitioner "Save the Capitol, Save the Trees" brings this mandamus action
7 in the public interest to enforce environmental laws that protect our State Capitol 8

9 Complex. The magnificent Capitol is treasured by Californians and is also of national

10 importance, honored with listing in the National Register of Historic Places.

11 This action subject to California Rules of Court 3.2223 et seq. challenges approval
12 of the impactful State Capitol Annex Project, defined in Public Resources Code section
13

14 21189.50, for failure to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

15 In 2016 and 2018, the California Legislature committed substantial funding for

16 the "construction ... restoration, rehabilitation, renovation, OR reconstruction of the

17 State Capitol Building Annex." The Legislature required that the Annex project
18

19 undergo environmental review, delegating sole lead agency responsibilities for

20 processing and approval of a CEQA-compliant project to the respondent Department

21 of General Services (DGS). Petitioner alleges that DGS, in collaboration with the

22 Department of Finance (Finance) and the Joint Committee on Rules of the California
23

24 State Senate and Assembly (Joint Rules Committee) has since generated bureaucratic

25 and financial momentum in violation of CEQA, pre-committing to a wholly new Annex

26 project that would demolish the historic Annex and Capitol Park arboretum.

27 Absent relief from this Court, pre-commitment to demolition will obviate
28 compliance with CEQA's substantive mandate. As well-settled in case law, agencies
must identify, consider, and approve feasible project mitigation measures and alternatives that

+

3

4 can avoid or reduce a project's significant environmental impacts. By mandating compliance

5 with CEQA, the Legislature has required no less for the Annex Project.

6 The current project would allow demolition of the historic Annex and an ever-
7

8 increasing number of historic trees for expanded offices, hearing rooms, conference

9 rooms, and : visitor / welcome center and underground parking garage. While the EIR

10 process is incomplete, there is already no question that demolition of the Annex and

11 arboretum trees would cause significant environmental and ecological impacts.
12
Respondents DGS, Joint Rules Committee, and Finance executed a 13

14 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in 2018 sans public process. The MOU

15 mandates confidentiality from its signatories, agents, and employees. It documents the

16 parties' commitment to a "new, a 500,000 gross square foot State Capitol Building
17 Annex" and to " demolition of the current Annex..." based on an in-house 2017 Capitol 18

19 State Annex Project Planning Study.

20 Adoption of the MOU without a public CEQA review process addressing the

21 legislatively-mandated alternatives of "restoration, rehabilitation, renovation, or

22 reconstruction" of the Capitol Annex violated CEQA as interpreted by the California 23

24 Supreme Court in Save Tara v. City of West Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116.

25 Save the Capitol, Save the Trees urgently petitions this Court for a peremptory

26 writ. Respondents should be ordered to set aside their actions effecting unlawful pre-

27 commitment to the Annex Project, including the MOU and related actions illuminated
28
in the to-be-certified record. DGS must revise, recirculate, and certify the EIR before
considering project approvals that fully comply with CEQA.

5 Jurisdiction

6

7 2. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code section 21168.5

8 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. The parties and the State Capitol Complex

9 are located in the City and County of Sacramento.
10

11 Parties

12
3.
13 Petitioner Save the Capitol, Save the Trees is an unincorporated association

14 formed in June 2021. Its public-interest purposes are to promote preservation of the

15 restored California Capitol and its entryway, west steps, and plaza, to retain and

16 renovate the historic East Annex, and to minimize any damage to the State Capitol
17

18 Park and its trees. Association members enjoy and appreciate the State Capitol and

19 Annex and Park and seek to enforce CEQA to protect them. They bring this petition on

20 behalf of all others similarly-situated and too numerous to be named and brought

21 before this Court as petitioners. Members of the Association objected to respondents'
22

23 pre-commitment to the current State Capitol Annex demolition project and exhausted

24 their administrative remedies.

25 4. Respondent California Department of General Services (DGS) is the lead

26 agency authorized by California law to conduct a CEQA process and to approve a
27 State Capitol Annex project in compliance with state law. 28
5. The Joint Rules Committee and Finance are signatories to the MOU. Via
the MOU, DGS purported to delegate approval of the State Capitol Annex project to the
Joint Rules Committee. The Joint Rules Committee and Finance are thus named in this

4 petition both as respondents and as real parties in interest as their actions,

5 responsibilities, and interests in the State Capitol Annex project display aspects of both.

6 6. Does 1 to 10 are fictitiously-named real parties in interest whose true
7

8 names and capacities are unknown to the Association. If and when true names and

9 capacities are known, the association may amend this petition to assert them.

10 7. A copy of this petition has been mailed to the California Attorney General.
11

12 General Allegations

13 8. The paragraphs below refer to and rely on information in documents that
14

15 will be lodged with this Court as part of the record of proceedings.

16
Environmental Setting
17

18 9. Sacramento became a river transportation hub and bustling Gold Rush

19 boomtown upon its founding in 1849. Just a year later in 1850 it was incorporated as a

20 city, and it became the state capitol in 1854. The historic State Capitol building was
21 constructed between 1860 and 1874. It is a monumental Classical Revival design, with
22

23 two virtually identical L-shaped four-story wings separated by a richly-decorated

24 rotunda. The dome of the rotunda rises to 210 feet. The west façade features a temple

25 front, with seven granite archways topped with a triangular pediment and five

26 allegorical figures: Minerva, Education, Industry, Justice, and Mining. The West Wing
27

28 includes cast-iron ornamentation: elaborate moldings, dentils, corbels, and pilasters.

10. The six-story Capitol Annex Building was constructed between 1949 and
1951, designed in the Mid-Century Moderne style and connected to the Capitol

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 5

4 Building. The Capitol and Annex appear as one building. The east façade of the Annex

5 features ten cast aluminum spandrel panels depicting California flora and fauna. Seven

6 panels around the doorways depict California industry including factories, trains, and
7

8 airplanes. The center panel features the seal of California. The Annex provides support

9 for the Governor and staff, the Lieutenant Governor, and the Legislature. DGS

10 acknowledges that "with its physical connection to the Historic Capitol, the Annex is

11 an important public asset, as it provides a venue for California's public to participate in
12
deliberative, democratic governmental processes

28 11. The Capitol Building and Annex are surrounded by Capitol Park, with
monuments, various memorials, walkways, landscaping, and ornamental trees

4 throughout. The Park is an evolving green arboretum planted with 800 trees and

5 flowering shrubs, laid out in a typical Victorian-era style, with long lanes for walking.

6 12. The State Capitol Complex - the Capitol Building, Capitol Annex, and
7

8 Capitol Park - is a CEQA historic resource and is honored with listing in the National

9 Register of Historic Places. The National Register bases the historic listing on the status

10 of the Complex as California's seat of government and for its monumental architecture

11 and landscape design. The Capitol building is also a California Historical Landmark.
12

13 Administrative and Environmental Review Process

14
13. DGS identified structural and operational deficiencies of the historic 15

16 Annex as to fire safety; non-compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and

17 modern energy efficiency standards; overcrowding; and aging and failing

18 infrastructure such as plumbing, electrical, heating / cooling. To address the
19 deficiencies, in 2016 the Legislature approved the State Capitol Building Annex Act
20

21 codified in Government Code sections 9105, et seq., allowing the Joint Rules Committee

22 to pursue construction of a state capitol building annex or the restoration,
23 rehabilitation, renovation, or reconstruction of the historic Capitol Annex.

24 14. Government Code section 9112 provides for the administration and
25

26 supervision of the Annex projects to proceed under the authority of DGS, and requires

27 an implementing agreement to be executed by the Joint Rules Committee, DGS, and

28 Finance. DGS is named as the "lead agency" and is thus responsible for CEQA
compliance and project approval, which the Joint Rules Committee must implement.

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 7

4 15. In 2017, a California State Capitol Annex Project Planning Study, which

5 was not subjected to any CEQA review or other public process, recommended

6 demolition of the historic Annex and construction of a new Annex; construction of an

7

8 adjacent parking structure; and construction of a Capitol Visitor Center. DGS and the

9 Joint Rules Committee reviewed the recommendations.

10 16. DGS, the Joint Rules Committee, and Finance entered into an agreement in

11 November 2018, as mandated by Government Code section 9112, styled as a
12 Memorandum of Understanding. Although reciting legislated authority to pursue,
13

14 alternatively, "the construction of a new, restored, rehabilitated, renovated or reconstructed

15 capitol building annex and associated projects" the MOU commits to "a new, approximately

16 500,000 gross square foot State Capitol Building Annex" to be built following
17 demolition of the historic Annex. The MOU mandates confidentiality by its signatories,
18

19 agents, and employees. It was not released to the public until DGS did so in April 2021

20 following a public records request.

21 17. DGS published and posted on its website a Draft EIR for the Annex

22 demolition project in September 2019, addressing three main components: demolition
23

24 of the Annex, construction of a new underground visitor / welcome center, and

25 construction of a new underground parking garage. DGS held an informational

26 meeting and a public hearing during a 45-day public comment period ending in

27 October 2019. Shortly thereafter, DGS altered the design of the proposed new
28 visitor /welcome center analyzed in the Draft EIR. It published a Recirculated Draft EIR
in January 2020 to address the modified project and opened a new public comment
period. While DGS then prepared responses to comments on the recirculated Draft EIR,

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 8

2

3

4 to date its project website has not posted the comments or responses. The website statesl

5 that the comments on the recirculated EIR are available on request.

6 18. In the 18 months since DGS published the Recirculated Draft EIR, it
7
continues to make substantial modifications to the project description affecting the 8

9 Capitol complex, with potentially significant environmental impacts not foreseen in the
10 authorizing legislation. On March 22, 2021, the Joint Rules Committee held an

11 informational hearing and disclosed numerous material project changes from the
12
project described in the recirculated EIR, with previously-unforeseen environmental 13

14 impacts, including, inter alia:

15 a) Revised parking location and revised entrances and exits. The changes

16 trigger needed analysis of whether the new parking garage and its wings along the
17 north and side would be adequately secure to protect building occupants, especially
18

19 the plaza and lower level from blast and toxic agent spread. The changes, including

20 newly-proposed relocation of many city palm trees, also require study and comment by

21 the City of Sacramento. Traffic calculations on L Street now need analysis as the street

22 is a feeder to the I-5 freeway on ramps.
23

24 b) The count of trees to be affected has gone up tremendously. It was initially

25 foreseen by the project EIR "that approximately 20-30 trees would need to be removed

26 to implement the project." The latest disclosed estimate is 133, including 62 unspecified

27 trees to be removed and 71 displaced and attempted for transplant.
28
c) The newly-altered proposed height and width of the replacement Annex
exceeds the EIR project description as "no taller than the parapet of the Historic Capitol

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 9

1.

2

3

4 and /or the base of the existing Capitol dome." The changes would cause unforeseen

5 permanent effects on historical and architectural and visual resources.

6 d) The proposed 100% glass exterior is a skin incompatible with the Capitol's
7

8 exterior materials. It would permanently impact trees and would attract and kill birds.

9 Save the Capitol, Save the Trees was among those who urged DGS to further

10 revise and recirculate the EIR to address the significant project changes.

11 19. Association members and others also urged DGS to comply with Public
12

13 Resources Code section 5024.5 before publishing a further revised Draft EIR or

14 considering project approval. Section 5024.5 requires that a California state agency -

15 here, the lead agency DGS who is charged with CEQA review and project approval

16 not alter "original or significant historical features or fabric, or transfer, relocate, or
17 demolish historical resources ..• without, early in the planning processes, first giving
18

19 notice and a summary of the proposed action to the [State Historic Preservation

20 Officer] who shall have 30 days after receipt of the notice and summary for review and

21 Icomment." The agency and the SHPO "shall adopt prudent and feasible measures that
22 will eliminate or mitigate adverse effects." The Association alleges that DGS, required
23

24 by the Legislature to administer and supervise all work on the Annex Project, has not

25 initiated consultation with the SHPO to eliminate or mitigate adverse project effects to

26 the historic Annex, despite conducting the EIR process now pending since 2019.

27 20. Approximately a month ago, on June 10, 2021, counsel for the Association
28
notified DGS through letter to its Deputy Director Jason Kenney, copied to the Joint
Rules Committee and Finance, that, inter alia, approval of the newly-disclosed MOU
in conjunction with related actions by DGS effected approval of the Annex project

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 10

2

3

4 without compliance with CEQA, contrary to the Supreme Court's mandate in Save Tara.

5 The Association requested that "the MOU and all attachments be revoked forthwith."

6 The Association to date has received no response to its request.
7
21. Respondents
8 have not certified an Annex Project EIR nor filed a Notice of
Determination. Their pre-commitment approval via the MOU was disclosed in April

10 2021, and other actions followed to implement that approval. A 180-day CEQA statute

11 of limitations commenced in April 2021. This petition is timely.
12
22.
13 The Association has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the

14 ordinary course of law. Issuance of a peremptory writ is imperative to avoid

15 irreparable harm to California and Sacramento residents and their historic environment

16 via physical harm to the historic State Capitol Complex. Respondents have the capacity
17 to correct their violations of law but have failed and refused to do so.
18

19 Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act
20

21 23. The Association incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

22 24. The new Capitol Annex Project would dramatically reshape the historic

23 State Capitol. Pursuant to the MOU, the Capitol Annex and much of the Capitol Park

24 arboretum and Native American tribal resources would be demolished and destroyed
25

26 for an incompatible glass-sheathed structure. The entryway, West Plaza, and Capitol

27 Steps - site of innumerable marches, speeches, and celebrations would be replaced

28 by a Visitor Center with a theme-park-style entrance. It increasingly appears,
unforeseen at the time of the 2016 or 2018 authorizing legislation in the Government

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 11

L

2

3

4 Code and Public Resources Code, that removal of more than sixty massive historic

5 trees as now contemplated would result in great ecological loss.

6 25. CEQA requires public agencies to conduct a prescribed, public EIR process
7 before taking discretionary actions that may have any significant adverse
8

9 environmental impact. The point of the process is to inform the public and to provide

10 necessary information to allow lead agencies to comply with CEQA's substantive

11 mandate: to adopt feasible project mitigations and alternatives that can reduce a
12 project's significant environmental impacts. A lead agency that predetermines approval
13

14 of a project with potentially significant environmental impact via actions creating

15 bureaucratic and financial momentum before preparing an EIR violates CEQA.

16 26. Respondents abused their discretion and failed to act as required by law in

17 pre-committing to approve a new Capitol Annex without first preparing and certifying
18

19 project EIR and meeting all mandates of CEQA. The Legislature authorized

20 respondents to pursue "the construction of a new, restored, rehabilitated, renovated or

21 reconstructed capitol building annex and associated projects" with DGS acting as the lead

22 CEQA. The Legislature further provided an expedited judicial review agency under
23

24 process while retaining each and every procedural and substantive mandate of CEQA.

25 Respondents unlawfully pre-committed to the project by entering into the MOU and

26 taking other actions to effect an intent to demolish, according to proof. Their actions

27 created bureaucratic and financial momentum that prevent consideration of feasible
28 alternatives, reducing the EIR process to post-hoc rationalization.

27. As respondents have made and continue to make significant material
changes to the project, the current Draft EIR does not contain a finite project description

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 12

2

3

4 from which to analyze and mitigate significant environmental impacts. The Draft EIR

5 addresses impacts assumed to occur due to the already-approved demolition prior to

6 CEQA review and comment or consultation with OHP.
7
28. While this action does not challenge the sufficiency of the uncertified EIR,
8

9 the EIR's lack of finite project description is relevant to this action because when the

10 Legislature provided for development of a State Capitol Annex project in 2016 and

11 2018, it limited future injunctive relief under CEQA to, inter alia, project features that
12 would impact "unforeseen important Native American artifacts or unforeseen
13

14 important historical, archaeological, or ecological values that would be materially,
15 permanently, and adversely affected..." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21189.53.) As will be

16 documented and illuminated in the record of proceedings, if the project proceeds in its
17 current form it would have significant impacts not foreseen in 2016 and 2018 and that
18

19 therefore warrant injunctive relief.

20 29. Before completing the Capitol Annex Project EIR, respondents must set

21 aside the MOU and correct other actions that pre-commit to demolition. DGS must

22 complete its mandated actions as the designated lead agency. As ruled by the Supreme
23

24 Court in Save Tara v. City of West Hollywood, supra, 45 Cal.4th 116, 139:

25 [C]ourts should look to the surrounding circumstances to determine

26 whether, as a practical matter, the agency has committed itself to the project as a

27 whole or to any particular features, so as to effectively preclude any alternatives

28 or mitigation measures that CEQA would otherwise require to be considered,
including the alternative of not going forward ....

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 13

4 WHEREFORE, petitioner prays:

5 1. That the Court issue judgment and a peremptory writ ordering the state

6 respondents to set aside the MOU and all approval actions relating to the State Capitol
7

8 Annex Project, requiring that before further consideration of approval DGS complete

9 its mandated duties as lead agency to revise and recirculate the project EIR to remove

10 all statements of pre-commitment and to approve an Annex Project only after

11 identifying and adopting feasible mitigations and alternatives and making all findings
12

13 required by CEQA, supported by substantial evidence in the record;

14 2. That the Court enjoin respondents and real parties in interest and their

15 employees and agents from physical actions furthering the project while the petition is

16 pending, consistent with restrictions in Public Resources Code section 21189.53;
17
3.
18 For petitioner's reasonable costs, expenses, and attorney's fees pursuant

Petition for Writ of Mandamus

2

3

4 Petitioner alleges:

5 Introduction

6 1. Petitioner "Save the Capitol, Save the Trees" brings this mandamus action
7

8 in the public interest to enforce environmental laws that protect our State Capitol

9 Complex. The magnificent Capitol is treasured by Californians and is also of national

10 importance, honored with listing in the National Register of Historic Places.

11 This action subject to California Rules of Court 3.2223 et seq. challenges approval
12

13 of the impactful State Capitol Annex Project, defined in Public Resources Code section

14 21189.50, for failure to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

15 In 2016 and 2018, the California Legislature committed substantial funding for

16 the "construction ... restoration, rehabilitation, renovation, OR reconstruction of the

17 State Capitol Building Annex." The Legislature required that the Annex project
18

19 undergo environmental review, delegating sole lead agency responsibilities for

20 processing and approval of a CEQA-compliant project to the respondent Department

21 of General Services (DGS). Petitioner alleges that DGS, in collaboration with the

22 Department of Finance (Finance) and the Joint Committee on Rules of the California
23

24 State Senate and Assembly Joint Rules Committee) has since generated bureaucratic

25 and financial momentum in violation of CEQA, pre-committing to a wholly new Annex

26 project that would demolish the historic Annex and Capitol Park arboretum.

27 Absent relief from this Court, pre-commitment to demolition will obviate
28 compliance with CEQA's substantive mandate. As well-settled in case law, agencies
must identify, consider, and approve feasible project mitigation measures and alternatives that

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 2

4 can avoid or reduce project's significant environmental impacts. By mandating compliance

5 with CEQA, the Legislature has required no less for the Annex Project.

6 The current project would allow demolition of the historic Annex and an ever-
7

8 increasing number of historic trees for expanded offices, hearing rooms, conference

9 rooms, and a visitor / welcome center and underground parking garage. While the EIR

10 process is incomplete, there is already no question that demolition of the Annex and

11 arboretum trees would cause significant environmental and ecological impacts.
12

13 Respondents DGS, Joint Rules Committee, and Finance executed a

14 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in 2018 sans public process. The MOU

15 mandates confidentiality from its signatories, agents, and employees. It documents the

16 parties' commitment to a "new, 500,000 gross square foot State Capitol Building
17

18 Annex" and to "demolition of the current Annex..." based on an in-house 2017 Capitol

19 State Annex Project-Planning Study.

20 Adoption of the MOU without a public CEQA review process addressing the

21 legislatively-mandated alternatives of "restoration, rehabilitation, renovation, or
22 reconstruction" of the Capitol Annex violated CEQA as interpreted by the California
23

24 Supreme Court in Save Tara v. City of West Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116.

25 Save the Capitol, Save the Trees urgently petitions this Court for a peremptory

26 writ. Respondents should be ordered to set aside their actions effecting unlawful pre-

27 commitment to the Annex Project, including the MOU and related actions illuminated
28
in the to-be-certified record. DGS must revise, recirculate, and certify the EIR before
considering project approvals that fully comply with CEQA.

5 Jurisdiction

6

7 2. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code section 21168.5

8 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. The parties and the State Capitol Complex

9 are located in the City and County of Sacramento.
10

11 Parties
12

13 3. Petitioner Save the Capitol, Save the Trees is an unincorporated association

14 formed in June 2021. Its public-interest purposes are to promote preservation of the

15 restored California Capitol and its entryway, west steps, and plaza, to retain and

16 renovate the historic East Annex, and to minimize any damage to the State Capitol
'17

18 Park and its trees. Association members enjoy and appreciate the State Capitol and

19 Annex and Park and seek to enforce CEQA to protect them. They bring this petition on

20 behalf of all others similarly-situated and too numerous to be named and brought

21 before this Court as petitioners. Members of the Association objected to respondents'
22

23 pre-commitment to the current State Capitol Annex demolition project and exhausted

24 their administrative remedies.

25 4. Respondent California Department of General Services (DGS) is the lead

26 agency authorized by California law to conduct a CEQA process and to approve a
27

28 State Capitol Annex project in compliance with state law.

5. The Joint Rules Committee and Finance are signatories to the MOU. Via
the MOU, DGS purported to delegate approval of the State Capitol Annex project to the
Joint Rules Committee. The Joint Rules Committee and Finance are thus named in this

4 petition both as respondents and as real parties in interest as their actions,

5 responsibilities, and interests in the State Capitol Annex project display aspects of both.

6 6. Does 1 to 10 are fictitiously-named real parties in interest whose true
7

8 names and capacities are unknown to the Association. If and when true names and

9 capacities are known, the association may amend this petition to assert them.

10 7. A copy of this petition has been mailed to the California Attorney General.

12 General Allegations

13 8. The paragraphs below refer to and rely on information in documents that
14

15 will be lodged with this Court as part of the record of proceedings.

17 Environmental Setting

18 9. Sacramento became a river transportation hub and bustling Gold Rush
19 boomtown upon its founding in 1849. Just a year later in 1850 it was incorporated as a

20 city, and it became the state capitol in 1854. The historic State Capitol building was
21

22 constructed between 1860 and 1874. It is a monumental Classical Revival design, with

23 two virtually identical L-shaped four-story wings separated by richly-decorated
24 rotunda. The dome of the rotunda rises to 210 feet. The west façade features a temple

25 front, with seven granite archways topped with a triangular pediment and five
26 allegorical figures: Minerva, Education, Industry, Justice, and Mining. The West Wing
27

28 includes cast-iron ornamentation: elaborate moldings, dentils, corbels, and pilasters.

10. The six-story Capitol Annex Building was constructed between 1949 and
1951, designed in the Mid-Century Moderne style and connected to the Capitol

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 5

3 .. 4.

5 Building. The Capitol and Annex appear as one building. The east façade of the Annex

6 features ten cast aluminum spandrel panels depicting California flora and fauna. Seven

8 panels around the doorways depict California industry including factories, trains, and

9 airplanes. The center panel features the seal of California. The Annex provides support
for the Governor and staff, the Lieutenant Governor, and the Legislature. DGS
10 acknowledges that "with its physical connection to the Historic Capitol, the Annex is

11

12

13 an important public asset, as it provides a venue for California's public to participate in
deliberative, democratic governmental processes ...'

5 throughout. The Park is an evolving green arboretum planted with 800 trees and

6 flowering shrubs, laid out a in a typical Victorian-era style, with long lanes for walking.

12.

7 The State Capitol Complex - the Capitol Building, Capitol Annex, and

8

9 Capitol Park - is a CEQA historic resource and is honored with listing in the National

10 Register of Historic Places. The National Register bases the historic listing on the status

11 of the Complex as California's seat of government and for its monumental architecture

12 and landscape design. The Capitol building is also a California Historical Landmark.

13

14 Administrative and Environmental Review Process

13.
15 DGS identified structural and operational deficiencies of the historic

16

17 Annex as to fire safety; non-compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and
modern energy efficiency standards; overcrowding; and aging and failing
18 infrastructure such as plumbing, electfical, heating / cooling. To address the
19

20 deficiencies, in 2016 the Legislature approved the State Capitol Building Annex Act

21

22 codified in Government Code sections 9105, et seq., allowing the Joint Rules Committee

23 to pursue construction of a state capitol building annex or the restoration,

24 rehabilitation, renovation, or reconstruction of the historic Capitol Annex.

14.
25 Government Code section 9112 provides for the administration and

26

27 supervision of the Annex projects to proceed under the authority of DGS, and requires

28 an implementing agreement to be executed by the Joint Rules Committee, DGS, and
Finance. DGS is named as the "lead agency" and is thus responsible for CEQA
compliance and project approval, which the Joint Rules Committee must implement.

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 7

3

4 15. In 2017, a California State Capitol Annex Project Planning Study, which

5 was not subjected to any CEQA review or other public process, recommended

6 demolition of the historic Annex and construction of a new Annex; construction of an
7

8 adjacent parking structure; and construction of a Capitol Visitor Center. DGS and the

9 Joint Rules Committee reviewed the recommendations.

10 16. DGS, the Joint Rules Committee, and Finance entered into an agreement in

11 November 2018, as mandated by Government Code section 9112, styled as a
12

13 Memorandum of Understanding. Although reciting legislated authority to pursue,
14 alternatively, "the construction of a new, restored, rehabilitated, renovated or reconstructed

15 capitol building annex and associated projects" the MOU commits to "a new, approximately

16 500,000 gross square foot State Capitol Building Annex" to be built following
17

18 demolition of the historic Annex. The MOU mandates confidentiality by its signatories, 4wi, Ai 3Anr con

19 agents, and employees. It was not released to the public until DGS did so in April 2021

20 following public records request.

21 17. DGS published and posted on its website a Draft EIR for the Annex
22 demolition project in September 2019, addressing three main components: demolition
23

24 of the Annex, construction of new underground visitor / welcome center, and
25 construction of a new underground parking garage. DGS held an informational

26 meeting and a public hearing during a 45-day public comment period ending in

27 October 2019. Shortly thereafter, DGS altered the design of the proposed new
28 visitor / welcome center analyzed in the Draft EIR. It published a Recirculated Draft EIR
in January 2020 to address the modified project and opened a new public comment
period. While DGS then prepared responses to comments on the recirculated Draft EIR,

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 8

2

3

4 to date its project website has not posted the comments or responses. The website states

5 that the comments on the recirculated EIR are available on request.

6 18. In the 18 months since DGS published the Recirculated Draft EIR, it
7

8 continues to make substantial modifications to the project description affecting the

9 Capitol complex, with potentially significant environmental impacts not foreseen in the
10 authorizing legislation. On March 22, 2021, the Joint Rules Committee held an

11 informational hearing and disclosed numerous material project changes from the
12

13 project described in the recirculated EIR, with previously-unforeseen environmental

14 impacts, including, inter alia:

15 a) Revised parking location and revised entrances and exits. The changes

16 trigger needed analysis of whether the new parking garage and its wings along the
17

18 north and side would be adequately secure to protect building occupants, especially 4g4e.-

19 the plaza and lower level from blast and toxic agent spread. The changes, including

20 /newly-proposed relocation of many city palm trees, also require study and comment by

21 the City of Sacramento. Traffic calculations on L Street now need analysis as the street
22 is a feeder to the I-5 freeway on ramps.
23

24 b) The count of trees to be affected has gone up tremendously. It was initially

25 foreseen by the project EIR "that approximately 20-30 trees would need to be removed

26 to implement the project." The latest disclosed estimate is 133, including 62 unspecified

27 trees to be removed and 71 displaced and attempted for transplant.
28
c) The newly-altered proposed height and width of the replacement Annex
exceeds the FIR project description as "no taller than the parapet of the Historic Capitol

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 9

2

3

and/or the base of the existing Capitol dome." The changes would cause unforeseen

5 permanent effects on historical and architectural and visual resources.

6 d) The proposed 100% glass exterior is a skin incompatible with the Capitol's
7

8 exterior materials. It would permanently impact trees and would attract and kill birds.

9 Save the Capitol, Save the Trees was among those who urged DGS to further
10 revise and recirculate the EIR to address the significant project changes.

11 19. Association members and others also urged DGS to comply with Public
12 Resources Code section 5024.5 before publishing a further revised Draft EIR or

14 considering project approval. Section 5024.5 requires that a California state agency -

15 here, the lead agency DGS who is charged with CEQA review and project approval -

16 not alter "original or significant historical features or fabric, or transfer, relocate, or
17

18 demolish historical resources ... without, early in the planning processes, first giving

19 notice and a summary of the proposed action to the [State Historic Preservation

20 Officer] who shall have 30 days after receipt of the notice and summary for review and

21 comment." The agency and the SHPO "shall adopt prudent and feasible measures that
22 will eliminate or mitigate adverse effects." The Association alleges that DGS, required
23

24 by the Legislature to administer and supervise all work on the Annex Project, has not

25 initiated consultation with the SHPO to eliminate or mitigate adverse project effects to

26 the historic Annex, despite conducting the EIR process now pending since 2019.
27 20. Approximately a month ago, on June 10, 2021, counsel for the Association
28
notified DGS through a letter to its Deputy Director Jason Kenney, copied to the Joint
Rules Committee and Finance, that, inter alia, approval of the newly-disclosed MOU
in conjunction with related actions by DGS effected approval of the Annex project

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 10

2

3

4 without compliance with CEQA, contrary to the Supreme Court's mandate in Save Tara.

5 The Association requested that "the MOU and all attachments be revoked forthwith."

6 The Association to date has received no response to its request.
7
21.
8 Respondents have not certified an Annex Project EIR nor filed a Notice of
Determination. Their pre-commitment approval via the MOU was disclosed in April

10 2021, and other actions followed to implement that approval. A 180-day CEQA statute

11 of limitations commenced in April 2021. This petition is timely.
12
22.
13 The Association has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the

14 ordinary course of law. Issuance of a peremptory writ is imperative to avoid

15 irreparable harm to California and Sacramento residents and their historic environment

16 via physical harm to the historic State Capitol Complex. Respondents have the capacity
17 to correct their violations of law but have failed and refused to do so,
18

19 Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act
20

21 23. The Association incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

22 24. The new Capitol Annex Project would dramatically reshape the historic

23 State Capitol. Pursuant to the MOU, the Capitol Annex and much of the Capitol Park
24

25 arboretum and Native American tribal resources would be demolished and destroyed

26 for an incompatible glass-sheathed structure. The entryway, West Plaza, and Capitol

27 Steps site of innumerable marches, speeches, and celebrations - would be replaced

28 by a Visitor Center with a theme-park-style entrance. It increasingly appears,
unforeseen at the time of the 2016 or 2018 authorizing legislation in the Government

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 11

2

3

4 Code and Public Resources Code, that removal of more than sixty massive historic

5 trees as now contemplated would result in great ecological loss.

6 25. CEQA requires public agencies to conduct a prescribed, public EIR process
7

8 before taking discretionary actions that may have any significant adverse

9 environmental impact. The point of the process is to inform the public and to provide
10  necessary information to allow lead agencies to comply with CEQA's substantive

11. mandate: to adopt feasible project mitigations and alternatives that can reduce a
12

13 project's significant environmental impacts. A lead agency that predetermines approval

14 of a project with potentially significant environmental impact via actions creating

15 bureaucratic and financial momentum before preparing an EIR violates CEQA.

16 26. Respondents abused their discretion and failed to act as required by law
17

18 pre-committing to approve a new Capitol Annex without first preparing and

19 certifying a project EIR and meeting all mandates of CEQA. The Legislature authorized

20 respondents to pursue "the construction of a new, restored, rehabilitated, renovated or

21 reconstructed capitol building annex and associated projects" with DGS acting as the lead
22 agency under CEQA. The Legislature further provided an expedited judicial review
23

24 process while retaining each and every procedural and substantive mandate of CEQA.

25 Respondents unlawfully pre-committed to the project by entering into the MOU and

26 taking other actions to effect an intent to demolish, according to proof. Their actions

27 created bureaucratic and financial momentum that prevent consideration of feasible
28
alternatives, reducing the EIR process to post-hoc rationalization.

27. As respondents have made and continue to make significant material changes to
the project, the current Draft EIR does not contain a finite project description from

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 12

2

3

4 which to analyze and mitigate significant environmental impacts. The Draft EIR

5 addresses impacts assumed to occur due to the already-approved demolition prior to

6 CEQA review and comment or consultation with OHP.
7
28.
8 While this action does not challenge the sufficiency of the uncertified EIR,

9 the EIR's lack of a finite project description is relevant to this action because when the

10 Legislature provided for development of a State Capitol Annex project in 2016 and

11 2018, it limited future injunctive relief under CEQA to, inter alia, project features that
12

13 would impact "unforeseen important Native American artifacts or unforeseen

14 important historical, archaeological, or ecological values that would be materially,

15 permanently, and adversely affected..." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21189.53.) As will be

16 documented and illuminated in the record of proceedings, if the project proceeds in its
17

18 current form it would have significant impacts not foreseen in 2016 and 2018 and that

19 therefore warrant injunctive relief.

20 29. Before completing the Capitol Annex Project EIR, respondents must set

21 aside the MOU and correct other actions that pre-commit to demolition. DGS must
22

23 complete its mandated actions as the designated lead agency. As ruled by the Supreme

24 Court in Save Tara V, City of West Hollywood, supra, 45 Cal.4th 116, 139:

25 [C]ourts should look to the surrounding circumstances to determine

26 whether, as a practical matter, the agency has committed itself to the project as a

27 whole or to any particular features, so as to effectively preclude any alternatives

28 or mitigation measures that CEQA would otherwise require to be considered,
including the alternative of not going forward ....

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 13

L

3

4 WHEREFORE, petitioner prays:

5 1. That the Court issue judgment and a peremptory writ ordering the state

6 respondents to set aside the MOU and all approval actions relating to the State Capitol
7

8 Annex Project, requiring that before further consideration of approval DGS complete

9 its mandated duties as lead agency to revise and recirculate the project EIR to remove

10 all statements of pre-commitment and to approve an Annex Project only after
11 identifying and adopting feasible mitigations and alternatives and making all findings
12

13 required by CEQA, supported by substantial evidence in the record;

14 2. That the Court enjoin respondents and real parties in interest and their

15 employees and agents from physical actions furthering the project while the petition is

16 pending, consistent with restrictions in Public Resources Code section 21189.53;
17
3.
18 For petitioner's reasonable costs, expenses, and attorney's fees pursuant

19 to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5; and

20 4. For other and further relief as the Court finds proper.
