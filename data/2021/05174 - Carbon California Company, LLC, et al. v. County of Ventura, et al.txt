1S AMEND. VERIFIED PET. FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioners and Plaintiffs Carbon California Company, LLC and Carbon California

3 Operating Company, LLC (collectively, "Carbon") bring this action to remedy the failure of the

4 County of Ventura (the "County") to properly evaluate, under the California Environmental

5 Equality Act, or CEQA, the environmental impacts associated with amendments to the County's

6 Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance designed to further limit oil and gas production and operations in
7 the County. The County improperly determined that these amendments are categorically exempt
8 from the provisions of CEQA. Because the amendments will significant and adversely impact the
9 environment, they are not exempt. The County further improperly relied on, at the last minute and
10 without compliance with CEQA, a previously-certified environmental impact report for the

11 County's 2040 General Plan as an "independent basis under CEQA for the adoption of the proposed
12 zoning ordinance amendments.3

13 2. Carbon also challenges the amendments to the County's Non-Coastal Zoning
14 Ordinance on non-CEQA grounds. Carbon requests declaratory relief that it has vested rights to
15 continue its existing operations to completion in all of its respective fields within the County
16 without further discretionary approvals from the County. Carbon also seeks declaratory relief
17 affirming that the County's amendments are preempted by State and federal law. Carbon
18 correspondingly seeks damages from the County as the amendments to the County's Non-Coastal
19 Zoning Ordinance constitute and unconstitutionally taking of Carbon's property interests.
20 3. Lastly, Carbon brings this action to remedy the County's violations of the Ralph M.
21 Brown Act (Gov. Code, § 54950 et seq., the "Brown Act") and to invalidate certain actions taken by

22 the County in violation of the Brown Act.

23 4. CEQA is set forth in the Public Resources Code, section 21000 et seq. Additionally,
24 the Governor's Office of Planning and Research and the California Natural Resources Agency
25 together prepare, develop, certify, and adopt the "CEQA Guidelines" (14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15000 §
26 et seq.) and amendments thereto. The CEQA Guidelines are regulations that clarify, interpret, and
27 implement CEQA.

25 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

26 The County's Historical Practice of Requiring Use Permits for Oil and Gas Production

27 10. The County's first zoning ordinance, adopted in 1947, included provisions regarding
28 "special use permits" for oil and gas development and production. Such permits are discretionary in

3
ISt AMEND. VERIFIED PET, FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

nature and allow the County to impose conditions of approval on the permits. Since 1966, the

2 County has required discretionary "conditional use permits" for oil and gas development and
3 production. After obtaining a use permit, a permittee typically obtains from the County ministerial

4 "zoning clearances" for specific items authorized by the permit. These ministerial zoning clearances

5 are not subject to the provisions of the CEQA.

6 11. Prior to 2019, the County consistently recognized the vested rights doctrine's

7 applicability to its oil and gas use permits, even permits approved before 1966 that the County

8 refers to now as "antiquated."

9 12. In 2013, the Board conducted a hearing regarding several items association with oil
10 and gas development and production, including hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and the so-called

11 "antiquated" County permits. In December 17, 2013, Board letter prepared for that hearing,

12 County staff stated,

13 The County has only a limited ability to address antiquated oilfield

14 permits due to the vested rights doctrine and constitutional takings and due process principles. The County's options to modify
15 antiquated oilfield permits consist of imposing: 1) permit changes that are reasonably related to a permittee's request for modification of an
16 existing permit; 2) limited permit changes based on the establishment by the County of harm, danger or nuisance caused by a permitted
17 activity; 3) limited permit changes based on the establishment by the

18 County of a permittee's significant violations of law or permit conditions; and 4) specific permit changes contemplated by existing
19 conditions in the permit. In addition, a permit could be revoked if its operations constitute a nuisance and imposition of conditions to
20 eliminate the nuisance is not feasible.

21 13. In 2014, the County's County Counsel's Office issued a memorandum titled "Legal
22 Analysis of Antiquated Oilfield Conditional Use Permits" (the *2014 Memorandum"). The 2014

23 Memorandum discussed how the "drilling of wells for oil and gas production has been continuously

24 subject to a permit from the County since" the County's first zoning ordinance. The 2014
25 || Memorandum further noted that the County's "zoning ordinance has become more stringent in its
26 regulation of oil and gas development and production and the conditions imposed on use permits

27 have become more stringent." However, the 2014 Memorandum also concluded that the County's

28 ability to impose new conditions on older, or "antiquated" oilfield permits:

4
1$ AMEND. VERIFIED PET. FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 is very limited. Because of the vested rights doctrine and

2 constitutional protections afforded these permits, the County can impose new, narrowly tailored conditions on these permits only when
3 a compelling public necessity, such as dänger, harm or public nuisance, or significant violations exist, and not through an ordinary
4 exercise of the police power for the general welfare.

5 14. In 2015, the Board conducted a studÿ session with other public agencies and the

6 public regarding the California condor and possible effects from oil and gas operations in the

7 County. In connection with that study session, the County Planning Director issued a December 15,

8 2015, Board letter that stated in part:

9 Many oil and gas facilities, however, operate pursuant to existing
10 permits in which the permit holder possesses vested rights. The County's authority to modify these permits is limited by the vested
11 rights doctrine. Rights in a permit "vest" (i.e., become protected) when the permit has been issued and the permit holder has invested
12 substantial sums in the furtherance of the authorized uses. Once

13 permit rights vest, the permit a holder has a property right in the permit as approved that cannot be modified by the County - for instance, by
14 adding new condor-related• permit conditions without satisfying constitutional due process requirements. Hence, vested rights in
15 existing permits cannot be unilaterally impaired by the County under its general land use authority. Instead, vested rights can only be
16 impaired if the impairment resulting from the new permit conditions

17 is reasonably necessary to address a menace to the public health and safety or a public nuisance presented by the permitted use. Important
18 factors to be considered in applying this standard are whether the nature and extent of the impairment to the vested rights is
19 proportionate to the nature, importance, and urgency of the interest to be served by the new permit conditions, and whether the permit
20 conditions are appropriately tailored and limited to the situation

21 necessitating the action.

22 In the event the County sought to unilaterally modify existing conditional use permits to add condor-related conditions, the County
23 would be required to meet the above-described standard for impairing the permit holder's vested rights in the permit. The standards must be 24 met with respect to each specific permit the County sought to modify,

25 and with respect to each specific condition sought to be added. Such permit modifications would require the provision of notice and a
26 public hearing to each affected permit holder.

27 The Board's 2019 Directives regarding Oil and Gas Use Permits

28 15. At an April 9, 2019, public hearing, a County Supervisor agendized a request to the

5
I" AMEND, VERIFIED PET. FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 Board to adopt an interim ordinance as an urgency measure to "temporarily prohibit the County's

2 approval of new oil and gas wells, and re-drilling of existing oil and gas wells, for oil production" in

3 a portion of the unincorporated area of the County near Oxnard. According to the Supervisor's

4 Board letter to his colleague, an oil operator proposed to drill new oil wells in the unincorporated

5 area of the County near Oxnard "pursuant to antiquated oil and gas permits." Also according to the
6 Supervisor's letter, the United States Geological Survey ("USGS") "found indications that
7 petroleum-related gases are migrating into the drinking water aquifers of the Fox Canyon aquifer
8 system in the vicinity of steam injection and wastewater disposal wells." The Supervisor's letter did

9 not inform the Board that the USGS stated that the detection of such gases could have resulted from

10 natural processes. In addition, the Supervisor's letter requested that the Board direct the County
11 Planning Division to "also study potential amendments to the County's zoning ordinances to require

12 discretionary approval of new development under antiquated oil and gas permits." The Board

13 approved the Supervisor's requested actions.

14 16. In September 2019, the County's County Counsel, not the Planning Division,

15 reported back to the Board regarding amendments to the County's zoning ordinances concerning the
16 so-called "antiquated permits." In a letter report dated September' 10, 2019, County Counsel
17 "provide[d] an overview of the legal issues and legislative options regarding" such amendments.
18 That letter report discussed vested rights principles associated with "antiquated" oil and gas permits.
19 Reversing its long-held position regarding the vested rights associated with such permits, County

20 Counsel concluded, "The County, however, has a good legal position that holders of typical
21 antiquated permits generally do not have vested rights to engage in new oil and gas development
22 based solely on the original antiquated permits ....' In support of its newly-developed position,
23 County Counsel further stated that the "antiquated" use permits are "analogous to general zoning

24 designations - which do not give rise to vested rights."

25 17. The September 10, 2019, letter report from County Counsel attached as an exhibit a

26 1955 "special use permit" a as a "representative antiquated permit." The County approved this 1955
27 permit after hearings by both the County Planning Commission and the Board. The 1955 permit
28 also contained substantial conditions, including limitations on the depth and location of drilling.

1st AMEND. VERIFIED PET. FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 18. County Counsel also provided to the Board, as an exhibit to the September 10, 2019,
2 letter report, proposed draft amendments to the County's Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance regarding

3 oil and gas permitting. County Counsel sought direction from the Board regarding these draft
4 amendments.

5 19. On September 9, 2019, Carbon submitted to the County through legal counsel a

6 comment letter regarding the Board's consideration of potential amendments to the County's
7 regulation of existing use permits for oil and gas production.

8 20. At the September 10, 2019, hearing, the Board approved a motion to "[r]eceive and
9 file County Counsel report, and direct the Planning Division to prepare draft amendments to the

10 County's zoning ordinances that are consistent with the potential draft amendment attached to the

11 County Counsel report to be processed through the standard land use public hearing process."

12 Oil and Gas Production in the County's 2040 General Plan and EIR

13 21. In January 2020, the County released for public review a draft "program" (as
14 opposed to "project") environmental impact report ("EIR") for its 2040 General Plan. According to

15 that draft EIR, "Although the legally required contents of a program EIR are the same as those of a

16 project EIR, program EIRs typically cover broad programs or large projects, such as a general plan, a
17 and contain a more general discussion of impacts, alternatives, and mitigation measures than a

18 project EIR.» The draft EIR further stated,

19 As a program EIR, this document uses appropriately programmatic
20 thresholds of significance as compared to the project-level thresholds that might be used for an EIR on a specific development project.
21 Because the 2040 General Plan EIR is broad and general, it may not be ripe for consideration of environmental impacts that may occur on
22 individual parcels or in connection with other projects that may be

23 consistent with the 2040 General Plan. The process described above, initiated with preparation of an initial study, provides a road map for
24 consideration of subsequent projects and the associated CEQA documentation.

25 In September 2020, the Board approved the 2040 General Plan and certified the final EIR for it (the

26 "General Plan EIR").

27 22. The 2040 General Plan includes new policies limiting oil and gas production in the
28 County, and the General Plan EIR purported to analyze the environmental impacts of such polices.

7
I" AMEND. VERIFIED PET. FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1. The General Plan EIR concluded that the policies would significantly and adversely impact mineral

2 resources within the County, which are which are themselves part of the "environment"' to be

3 protected under CEQA. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21060.5.) The County failed to mitigate or avoid

4 those impacts, as the Board deleted the only proposed mitigation measures that purported to address

5 the 2040 General Plan's significant impacts on mineral resources. The General Plan EIR also failed

6 to analyze the foreseeable, indirect, and significant impacts arising from the 2040 General Plan's
7 limitations on oil and gas production, including impacts regarding greenhouse gas emissions.

8 23. The General Plan EIR did not address cumulative impacts arising from the 2040

9 General Plan and the proposed zoning amendments even though the draft General Plan EIR stated,

10 "The County is considering amending its zoning ordinances to similarly require a discretionary

11 permit modification to authorize new oil and gas development under 'antiquated' use permits that

12 lack expiration dates, well limits, and other development parameters (i.e., approximately pre-

13 1966)."

14 The 2020 Zoning Ordinance Amendments regarding Oil and Gas Use Permits

15 24. In response to the Board's 2019 directive, County staff prepared proposed
16 amendments to Article 7, Section 8107-5 of the Ventura County Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance

17 regarding the County's permitting requirements for oil and gas development and production

18 (including as subsequently modified and approved by the Board, the "Zoning Amendments"). These
19 Amendments require a discretionary approval from the County for all "new" oil and gas
20 development and production operations, including the drilling of any new well, the re-drilling or

21 deepening of any existing well. The Zoning Amendments preclude the use of a ministerial zoning

22 clearance for new oil and gas operations.

23 25. The Zoning Amendments also apply the County's existing Oil Development

24 Guidelines, located in section 8107-5.5 of the County's Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance, to all new,

25 adjusted, or modified discretionary permits authorizing oil and gas development and production
26 operations. The Zoning Amendments also apply the County's existing Oil Development Standards,

27 located in section 8107-5.6 of the County's Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance, to all existing oil and
28 gas development and production operations. Among other items, these Guidelines and Standards

8
1* AMEND. VERIFIED PET. FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 impose restrictions on oil and gas development and production, including setback requirements, a
2 prohibition on the flaring of gas, and prohibition on the trucking of produced materials. According
3 to County staff, the 2020 Zoning Amendments "would slow and/or reduce the potential expansion
4 of certain new local oil and gas development."

5 26. The County Planning Commission considered the proposed Zoning Amendments at

6 a July 30, 2020, public hearing. On July 29, 2020, Carbon submitted a comment letter regarding the
7 proposed amendments to the Planning Commission through legal counsel. Carbon also spoke at the

8 July 30, 2020, hearing. The Planning Commission recommended approval of the Zoning

9 Amendments with minor revisions.

10 27. The Board considered the proposed Zoning Amendments at a November 10, 2020,
11 public hearing. County staff prepared a Board letter for the November 10, 2020, hearing regarding
12 the Zoning Amendments. That initial Board letter, made available to the public prior to the hearing,
13 recommended that the Board find the Zoning Amendments categorically exempt from CEQA
14 pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15308.

15 28. On November 9, 2020, Carbon submitted a comment letter to the Planning
16 Commission through legal counsel. Carbon's comment letter discussed why the Zoning
17 Amendments are not exempt from the provisions of CEQA, including because the amendments will
18 have significant and adverse impacts regarding mineral resources and greenhouse gas emissions.
19 Carbon also commented that the proposed zoning amendments will have cumulative impacts on

20 mineral resources when considered with policies in the 2040 General Plan.
21 29. On November 10, 2020, County staff distributed to the Board a "revised" Board
22 letter for the proposed zoning amendments. That revised Board letter included, for the first time, a
23 new recommendation to the Board that it also find that:

24 to the extent commenters have raised issues about the application of
25 new 2040 General Plan policies to new oil and gas wells, that those impacts factually are the same as the impacts evaluated in the certified
26 environmental impact report (EIR) for the 2040 General Plan, that there is no new or substantially more severe impact requiring a further
27 EIR under CEQA Guidelines section 15162, and that it is appropriate

28 to rely on that certified EIR for the extension of those policies to new oil and gas wells, and reliance on that EIR is an independent basis under CEQA for the adoption of the proposed zoning ordinance 9
1st AMEND. VERIFIED PET. FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 amendments.

2 30. Carbon is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the County did not

3 distribute or make available to the public the Revised Board Letter to the public before November

4 10, 2020. Carbon is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the County did not

5 distribute or make available to the public the Revised Board Letter to the public during the

6 November 10, 2020, Board hearing regarding the Zoning Amendments.

7 31. On November 10, 2020, the Board voted 3-2 to approve the Zoning Amendments.

8 The Board also found, with regard to CEQA and the Zoning Amendments:

9 a. "that the adoption of the proposed ordinance amending the Ventura County Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance (Exhibit 32) is
10 categorically exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act

11 (CEQA) pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15308 as actions by a regulatory agency to assure the maintenance and protection of the
12 environment because the project would implement a regulatory process involving procedures for protection of the environment";
13
b. "that no substantial evidence exists precluding the use of this 14 categorical exemption based on the presence of unusual

15 circumstances or any other exception set forth in CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2"; and

16
C. "to the extent commenters have raised issues about the
17 application of new 2040 General Plan policies to new oil and gas wells, that those impacts factually are the same as the impacts 18 evaluated in the certified environmental impact report (EIR) for the
19 2040 General Plan, that there is no new or substantially more severe impact requiring a further EIR under CEQA Guidelines section
20 15162, and that it is appropriate to rely on that certified EIR for the extension of those policies to new oil and gas wells, and reliance on
21 that EIR is an independent basis under CEQA for the adoption of the proposed zoning ordinance amendments."
22

23 32. Carbon is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the County purported

24 to file an effective Notice of Exemption with the County Clerk on November 13, 2020.

25 The Effect of the Zoning Amendments on Carbon's Vested Rights

26 33. Carbon acquired its property interests in the County from its predecessors at various

27 times since 2016. Carbon conducts its operations pursuant to discretionary use permits that were

28 originally approved by the County as far back as 1948 and as recently as 1981. Certain of these
permits, but not all, have subsequently been modified. Pursuant to these use permits, Carbon
1sE AMEND. VERIFIED PET. FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 produces oil and gas resources from multiple fields within the County. Under these permits, Carbon

2 or its predecessors have regularly drilled new wells or deepened existing wells pursuant to zoning

3 clearances and without further discretionary approvals, including new or modified use permits, from
4 the County.

5 34. Carbon and its predecessors have invested substantial sums in acquiring its interests

6 in the County and in maintaining and developing the infrastructure required to continue and
7 complete operations in these fields subject to the applicable use permits. Carbon continues to

8 operate in each of its fields and has objectively demonstrated an intent to complete operations in

9 each of its fields. Carbon has substantial reserves in each field that remain to be developed and

10 extracted. Carbon has vested rights to continue to extract oil and gas resources in each of its

11 permitted fields until completion.

12 35. The County has not established, or even sought to establish, that Carbon's operations

13 constitute a nuisance or a danger. The County has not established, or even sought to establish, that

14 Carbon has significantly violated the terms of any of its permits. The County has not offered any
15 compensation to Carbon.

16 36. The Zoning Amendments will limit Carbon's vested rights. The Zoning
17 Amendments impose new regulations and limitations on oil and gas development and production in
18 the County, in particular by imposing regulations establishing various setback requirements for
19 existing and new wells and by precluding the flaring of gas or the trucking of produced oil or water
20 in connection with existing and new operations. Carbon's operations involve and will continue to

21 involve the flaring of gas and the trucking of produced fluids. Additionally, Carbon operates in the

22 Zoning Amendments' setback areas and has additional reserves in those setback areas. The Zoning
23 Amendments will require Carbon to cease all operations in certain of its fields. The Zoning
24 Amendments will preclude Carbon from completing operations in many fields. The Zoning
25 Amendments will substantially interfere with Carbon's investment-backed expectations.
26 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

27 37. Carbon has exhausted all available administrative remedies before Respondents or is
28 otherwise excused from doing sO.

11
1# AMEND. VERIFIED PET. FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 38. Carbon has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law, and thus seeks a writ of
2 mandate from this Court. In the absence of such remedy, the County's violations of State law will

3 remain in effect.

4 39. This Court has jurisdiction to issue the requested writ of mandate, including pursuant

5 to Public Resources Code sections 21168.5 (or, alternatively, 21168) and 21168.9, Government

6 Code section 54960.1, subdivision (a), as well as Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 (or,
7 alternatively, 1094.5). This Court has jurisdiction over Carbon's requested injunctive relief,

8 including pursuant to Government Code section 54960.1, subdivision (a), and Code of Civil

9 Procedure section 525, et seq. This Court has jurisdiction over Carbon's requested declaratory relief
10 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1060.

11 40. Venue in this Court is appropriate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 393

12 and 394.

13 41. This Petition is timely filed, including pursuant to Public Resources Code section
14 21167, subdivision (d) and Government Code section 54960.1, subdivision (c)(4).
15 42. Carbon satisfied all applicable requirements of Government Code section 54960.1.
16 43. In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5, Carbon timely served on
17 Respondents by email and certified mail a written notice of Carbon's intention to commence this

18 action, a true and correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

19 44. Carbon previously notified Respondents that Carbon elects to prepare the record of
20 proceedings in this matter pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2).
21 45. In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil
22 Procedure section 388, Carbon will serve a copy of this Petition on the California Attorney General.
23 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

24 (Violations of CEQA, Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)
25 46. Carbon realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as if fully
26 set forth herein,

27 47. Broadly speaking, CEQA directs certain local agencies such as the County to
28 identify and analyze the potentially significant environmental impacts of certain actions, or

12
1st AMEND. VERIFIED PET. FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1. "projects," so as to inform agency decision-makers and the public of the environmental

2 consequences of a project. An agency undertaking the initial CEQA review of a project, referred to

3 as the "lead" agency, will usually engage in a three-step process. First, the lead agency determines if

4 the action being considered is a "project" subject to CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15060.) Second, §

5 the lead agency determines if the project is exempt from CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15061.)

6 Third, the lead agency determines whether the project could result in potentially significant

7 environmental impacts. Depending on whether or not there are significant impacts and whether

8 those a impacts can be mitigated to a level below significance, a lead agency will prepare a negative

9 declaration, a mitigated negative declaration, or a full EIR for a project. (CEQA Guidelines,

10 cop 15063, subd. (b).)

11 48. The County determined that the Zoning Amendments are categorically exempt from

12 CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15308, which exempts qualifying actions "to assure

13 the maintenance, restoration, enhancement, or protection of the environment." CEQA Guidelines

14 section 15308 does not apply to projects that will have a significant adverse environmental impact.

15 The Zoning Amendments will have a significant adverse environmental impacts, including on

16 mineral resources and regarding greenhouse gas emissions as well as cumulative impacts with the
17 2040 General Plan. Respondents improperly determined that the Zoning Amendments are exempt

18 from the provisions of CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15308.

19 49. Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2, subdivision (c), "A categorical

20 exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity

21 will a have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." CEQA Guidelines

22 section 15300.2, subdivision (c) negates a categorical exemption where a project has an unusual

23 circumstance and where there is "a reasonable possibility of a significant effect due to that unusual
24 circumstance." There is a reasonable possibility that the Zoning Amendments will have a significant

25 effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.

26 50. CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2, subdivision (c) also negates a categorical

27 exemption when there is "evidence that the a project will have a significant environmental effect."

28 Evidence that a project will have significant environmental impact necessarily establishes a a

13
1 AMEND. VERIFIED PET. FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1. reasonable possibility that the project will have a significant effect on the environment due to

2 unusual circumstances. The Zoning Amendments will have a significant adverse environmental

3 impacts, including on mineral resources (including by prohibiting or impeding mineral resource

4 extraction) and regarding greenhouse gas emissions (including those generated by required oil

5 imports). Respondents' determination that the "exception to the Categorical Exemption [found in

6 CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2, subdivision (c)] is not applicable to the proposed project" is not

7 supported by substantial evidence.

8 51. The County's improper determination that the Zoning Amendments are exempt from

9 the provisions of CEQA constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

10 52. Concurrently with its approval of the Zoning Amendments, the Board found that the

11 programmatic 2040 General Plan EIR "is an independent basis under CEQA for the adoption of the

12 proposed zoning ordinance amendments." Under CEQA, an agency may rely on a previously-

13 certified programmatic EIR to dispense with further CEQA review of an activity within the program

14 and if the activity's impacts were adequately analyzed by the programmatic EIR. (CEQA
15 Guidelines, § 15168, subd. (c).) On the other hand, an agency must prepare an "additional
16 environmental document" "[i]f a later activity would have effects that were not examined in the

17 program EIR." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15168, subd. (c).)

18 53. When an agency "proposes to carry out or approve an activity within the program
19 and to rely on the program EIR for CEQA compliance," an agency subject to public notice

20 requirements must notify the public that the proposed "activity is within the scope of the program

21 approved earlier" and that the "program EIR adequately describes the activity for the purposes of

22 CEQA." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15168, subd. (e).) The County was required to, but did not, comply

23 with the noticing requirements of CEQA Guidelines section 15168.

24 54. The County's finding that the programmatic 2040 General Plan EIR "is an
25 independent basis under CEQA for the adoption of the proposed zoning ordinance amendments" is

26 not supported by substantial evidence. The Zoning Amendments are not within the scope of the
27 2040 General Plan or its EIR. County staff's November 10, 2020, Board letter states, "The proposed

28 zoning amendments would make these new [2040 General Plan] policies applicable to a broader a

14
1$t AMEND. VERIFIED PET. FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1. range of proposed oil and gas development based on the new discretionary approval requirement for

2 projects which, under the status quo, only require[] a ministerial approval." The 2040 General Plan

3 EIR acknowledged that the 2040 General Plan's new policies regarding oil and gas production will

4 have significant, adverse impacts on the environment, including with regard to mineral resources

5 and related to greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, the significant environmental impacts

6 associated with those 2040 General Plan policies will be broadened by the Zoning Amendments.

7 The Zoning Amendments will result in significant environmental effects that were not examined in

8 the 2040 General Plan EIR and require a subsequent EIR under a CEQA Guidelines section 15162.

9 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15168, subd. (c).)

10 55. CEQA prohibits the "piecemealing" of large project into smaller ones in order to

11 minimize a project's impacts or avoid the full disclosure and analysis of a projects' environmental
12 impacts. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15378, subd. (a), 15063, subd. (a)(1).) The Board directed County

13 staff in September 2019 to prepare the Zoning Amendments to be consistent with already-drafted
14 provisions put forth to the Board in September 2019. The County circulated the draft 2040 General

15 Plan EIR for public review in January 2020. The draft General Plan EIR specifically noted that the

16 County was "considering amending its zoning ordinances to similarly require a discretionary permit
17 modification to authorize new oil and gas development under 'antiquated' use permits Despite

18 the reasonably foreseeable Zoning Amendments, the County illegally piecemealed them from the

19. 2040 General Plan and failed to adequately analyze the cumulative impacts of them, especially with

20 regard to mineral resources and greenhouse gas emissions.

21 56. CEQA provides requirements for an adequate and effective Notice of Exemption.
22 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15062.) Carbon is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the

23 County Clerk did not, with regard to the Notice of Exemption for the Zoning Amendments, comply

24 with the provisions of CEQA Guidelines section 15062, including by failing to make the Notice of
25 Exemption available for public inspection. Carbon is informed and believes, and on that basis

26 alleges, that the County did not comply with the alternative notice requirements of the Governor's
27 Executive Order N-54-20 or Executive Order N-80-20.

28 57. As a result of the foregoing CEQA violations, Respondents prejudicially abused their

15
19 AMEND. VERIFIED PET. FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1. discretion by exempting the Zoning Amendments from CEQA, by relying on the 2040 General Plan

2 EIR, by piecemealing the Zoning Amendments, and by failing to provide proper notice of its

3 actions.

4 58. Respondents have violated CEQA by failing to proceed in a manner required by law

5 and by failing to support their determinations or decisions with substantial evidence. (Pub.

6 Resources Code, § 21168.5.) Alternatively, Respondents have violated CEQA by proceeding in

7 excess of their jurisdiction and by prejudicially abusing their discretion by failing to proceed in the

8 manner required by law, by failing to support their decisions with findings, and by failing to support

9 their findings with substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168; Code Civ. Proc.,

10 § 1094.5.)

11 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

12 (Declaratory Relief regarding Vested Rights; C.C.P., § 1060 et seq.)
13 59. Carbon realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as if fully
14 set forth herein.

15 60. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Carbon and Respondents
16 concerning Carbon's vested rights arising from discretionary use permits obtained from the County

17 authorizing Carbon's oil and gas development and production on and below properties located in

18 the County. Carbon contend that all of its discretionary use permits give rise to vested rights to

19 continue oil and gas development and production in permitted fields until completion, whereas
20 Respondents dispute these contentions and contend that certain permits held by Carbon do not give

21 rise to any vested right to continue operating until completion without further discretionary

22 approvals from the County.

23 61. Carbon desires a judicial determination of the rights associated with its use permits
24 and requests a judicial declaration and determination that:

25 a. Carbon has vested rights to continue its existing operations to completion in all of its

26 respective fields within the County without further discretionary approvals from the

27 County;

28 b. the County may not require Carbon to obtain further discretionary use permits from

16
1$ AMEND. VERIFIED PET. FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 the County in order to continue its operations to completion in all of its respective

2 fields within the County; and

3 C. the County may not apply the Zoning Amendments to Carbon's existing use permits.

62. A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time under the
|l circumstances in order that Carbon may ascertain its rights and duties with respect to its permits and

6 property interests in order to plan its business activities with certainty.

7 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

8 (Declaratory Relief regarding Preemption)

9 63. Carbon realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as if fully

10 set forth herein.

11 64. Federal and State law comprehensively and exclusively regulate certain areas related

12 to oil and gas production, including the drilling, operation, and maintenance of wells. Federal and

13 State authority in these areas preempts local legislation and regulation of the same. The County

14 does not have authority to legislate or regulate in these areas except as specifically provided for by

15 federal or State law.

16 65. The Zoning Amendments constitute an impermissible intrusion into areas occupied

17 by federal and State law. The Zoning Amendments are preempted by federal and State law and are

18 invalid in whole or, alternatively, in part.

19 66. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Carbon and Respondents
20 concerning whether the Zoning Amendments are preempted by federal and State law. Carbon

21 desires a judicial declaration and determination that the Zoning Amendments are preempted by

22 federal and State law in whole or part.

23 67. A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time under the
24 circumstances in order that Carbon may ascertain its rights and duties with respect to its permits and

25 property interests in order to plan its business activities with certainty.
26 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

27 (Damages for Inverse Condemnation or Unconstitutional Taking; Cal. Const., art. I, 19;
28 U.S. Const., 5th Amend.)

17
1$ AMEND. VERIFIED PET. FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 68. Carbon realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as if fully

2 set forth herein.

3 69. If allowed to impair Petitioner's vested rights, the Zoning Amendments effectuate a

4 taking of Carbon's property. The Zoning Amendments will deprive Carbon of all, or substantially

5 all, of the economically beneficial use of certain property for the purported benefit of the public.

6 70. The Zoning Amendments also effectuate a taking of Carbon's property based on the

7 economic impact of the Zoning Amendments on Carbon, the extent of the Zoning Amendment's
8 interference with Carbon's investment-backed expectations (which were based on the vesting rights

9 associated with Carbon's use permits), and the character of the Zoning Amendments.

10 71. The Zoning Amendments violate article 1, section 19 of the California Constitution

11 and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and, more specifically, its Takings

12 Clause.

13 72. Carbon has not received any, let alone just, compensation from the County or

14 otherwise to remedy the taking of Carbon's property rights.

15 73. Carbon has been and will be damaged from the taking of its property rights and will
16 suffer damages in an amount to be determined at trial.

17 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Violations of the Brown Act, Gov. Code, § 54950, et seq.)

19 74. Carbon realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as if fully

20 set forth herein.

21 75. The Board is a "legislative body" pursuant to Government Code section 54952 and is

22 subject to the provisions of the Brown Act.

23 76. When there has been a violation of Government Code section 54954.2, an interested

24 person may seek to have the violative actions of a public agency's legislative body nullified and

25 voided by a court. (Gov. Code, § 54960.1, subd. (a).) Before initiating such litigation, the interested
26 person must make a written demand requesting that the legislative body "cure or correct" its Brown

27 Act violation. (Gov. Code, § 54960.1, subd. (c)(1).)

28 77. The Brown Act requires the County to post, at least 72 hours before a regular

18
Ist AMEND. VERIFIED PET. FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

meeting, an agenda "containing brief general description of each item of business to be transacted

2 or discussed at the meeting." (Gov. Code, § 54954.2, subd. (a)(1).) The County must include on its

3 agendas any CEQA determinations for a project, and the failure to do so is a prejudicial violation of

4 the Brown Act. (See San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced (2013) 216

5 Cal.App.4th 1167, 1176-79.) The Brown Act further prohibits the County from taking action "on

6 any item not appearing on the posted agenda." (Gov. Code, § 54954.2, subd. (a)(2).)

7 78. The County's agenda for the November 10, 2020, Board hearing regarding the

8 Zoning Amendments did not reference the County's intent to rely on the 2040 General Plan EIR.

9 79. By failing to notify the public of its intent to rely on the 2040 General Plan EIR for

10 the Zoning Amendments, the County violated the Brown Act and in particular Government Code

11 section 54954.2. In order to cure the violation, the Board must at least rescind its approval of the

12 Zoning Amendments and its reliance on the 2040 General Plan EIR.

13 80. On December 7, 2020, Carbon, through its counsel, requested that the Board cure

14 and correct its violation of the Brown Act. The Board did not respond to this request and did not
15 properly cure its violations of the Brown Act. Government Code section 54960.1, subdivision (e)

16 does not preclude this action.

17 81. The provisions of Government Code section § 54960.1, subdivision (d) are not

18 applicable to this action.

19 82. Carbon is an interested party that has been prejudiced by the County's violations of

20 the Brown Act, including because Carbon commented on the Zoning Amendments but was not

21 provided adequate notice that the County intended to rely on the 2040 General Plan EIR as part of

22 the CEQA review of those Zoning Amendments.

23 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

24 In each of the respects enumerated above, Respondents have violated their duties under the

25 law, abused their discretion, failed to proceed in a manner required by law, and made
26 determinations that are not supported by substantial evidence.

27 WHEREFORE, Carbon prays for relief as follows:

28 1. for a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to rescind, vacate, void, and

19
I$ AMEND. VERIFIED PET. FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

5 3. for a peremptory writ. directing respondents to void, vacate, and set aside

6 Respondents' determination that the 2040 General Plan EIR provides any basis for the required

7 CEQA review of the Zoning Amendments;

8 4. for a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary or permanent

9 injunctive relief or other order, including under Code of Civil Procedure section 526, enjoining
10 Respondents from taking any action in furtherance of, or to implement, the Zoning Amendments

11 during the pendency of this action;

12 5. for determinations and declarations that:

13 a. Carbon has vested rights to continue its existing operations to completion in all of its

14 respective fields within the County without further discretionary approvals from the

15 County;

16 b. the County may not require Carbon to obtain further discretionary use permits from

17 the County in order to continue its operations to completion in all of its respective

18 fields within the County;

20 and

21 d. the Zoning Amendments are preempted by federal and State law in whole or part.

22 6. for just compensation for the taking of property in an amount to be determined at

23 trial;

25 8. for costs of the suit;
