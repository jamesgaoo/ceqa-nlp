I. INTRODUCTION

1. Petitioners Foothill Conservancy and Friends of Greater Ione ("Petitioners") challenge
Respondent County of Amador's ("County") December 15, 2020 approval of a zoning change on
five parcels totaling 1,150 acres near the town of Ione ("Project") based on an application filed by
4 Edwin Lands, LLC ("Real Party"). The Project changes the zoning from a combination of
5 Agriculture and Residential to manufacturing, and adds a new 'X-overlay,' although such an
6 is overlay zone is not permitted under the General Plan's Industrial designation for this area.
7
2. In approving the Project, the County prepared a negative declaration under the California
8 Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000 et seq. The negative declaration
9 found that the Project would have no significant environmental impacts, including no impacts due
10

11 to the potential for increased groundwater and/or surface water demand due to the manufacturing
uses that will now be permitted on the 1,150 acres. To support this conclusion, the County relied
12 on the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) prepared for the 2016 General Plan, which found that
13 groundwater depletion due to future development would have impacts that were significant and
14 unavoidable. In the meantime, a new and unprecedented comprehensive study has showed that
15 the groundwater depletion is more than twice as much as previously estimated in 2016.
16
3. Petitioners challenge the County's approval of the Project as contrary to CEQA, Here, the
17 County's Negative Declaration states that the zoning change allowing for new manufacturing uses
18 will have no significant groundwater impacts, even though the Negative Declaration identifies that
19 groundwater is the foreseeable source for new development pursuant to the zoning change.
20 However, the General Plan EIR already identified these impacts as significant. Under CEQA, an
21 agency may not avoid further CEQA review by tiering to a prior EIR that found impacts to be
22 significant and unavoidable. Further, the new information and circumstances demonstrate the
23 potential for the Project to contribute to an overall cumulative groundwater depletion impact that
24 was not previously addressed and mitigated in the prior General Plan EIR.
25
4. Petitioners also challenge the County's approval of the Project as contrary to the County's
26 General Plan. The Project is located in an area designated as Industrial, which does not allow an
27 X-overlay as part of the designation. Here, however, the new zoning includes an X-overlay in
28 violation of the General Plan.

Petitioners' Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

5. Petitioners seek writ of mandate directing the County to set aside its Project approval
1 until it has complied with CEQA and its General Plan. See Code Civ. Proc. § 1085.

14 requested writ of mandate. In the absence of such remedy, the County's Project approval will remain
15 in effect in violation of law.
16 IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
17
A. SETTING AND PROJECT DESCRIPTION
18
16. The Project is located in western Amador County, between the Ione city limits and the
19 Sacramento County boundary. Land uses adjacent to the Project area are predominantly grazing and
20 crop production, scattered dwellings, and various mining and mineral processing operations.
21 17. The Project site is dominated by open rangeland with discontiguous oak woodlands. The
22 property has historically been, and is currently, used for cattle ranching. There are no structures on
23 the property. Up until the 1920s, the Project area was mined for lignite coal.
24 18. Historically the Project parcels were zoned as a combination of Agriculture and Residential.
25 In 2016, the County updated its General Plan, which changed the land use designation to Industrial
26 (I), which does not include Agriculture and Residential as allowable zoning districts.
27
19. The Project approves a zoning change on the parcels from Agriculture and Residential to
28 manufacturing (M), which is one of four acceptable districts in the Industrial GP designation. This

3
Petitioners' Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

zoning change is portrayed as a need to make the zoning on the five parcels consistent with the
General Plan.

2 20. The zoning change also adds an X overlay for mining and other heavy industrial uses allowed
3 in the manufacturing zone. The X overlay makes these uses conditional, subject to a discretionary
review process, including application of CEQA.
5 21. The new Manufacturing zone for the rezoned parcels permits all uses allowed in C-2 districts,
6 service stations, repair garages, manufacture, assembly, repair, processing, storage and shipping of
vegetable and mineral products, not including hydrocarbons, and excepting those uses listed in the

8 discretionary uses section of the "M" district regulations. In addition, discretionary uses allowed in

9 the M zone subject to the X-overlay include: Mining and quarrying, excavation of earth and minerals,
10 distillation of bones; fat rendering; dumping, disposal, incineration or reduction of garbage, sewage,
11 offal, dead animals or refuse, drilling for and removal of oil and natural gas, junk yards, wrecking
12 yards, commercial hog raising, manufacture of acids, explosives, fertilizer, gas, glue, gypsum,
13 inflammable fluids or gases, refining of petroleum and petroleum products; tank farms, ore smelting,
14 stockyards, slaughterhouses, tanneries, temporary labor camps, other uses which might be
15 objectionable by reason of production or emission of noise, offensive odor, smoke, dust, bright light,
16 vibration, radiation, or which involve the handling of explosives or dangerous materials.
17 22. The County staff report characterizes the intent and history of the Project as follows: "This
18 application is a request for a Zone Change to allow for future commercial and manufacturing uses (no
19 specific uses have been proposed with this application). The application previously included a zone

20 change request to the Manufacturing district and Parcel Map request for 8 parcels; the request was
21 later reduced to 2 parcels, then both were eventually withdrawn."

22 23. The County staff report characterizes the zoning as consistent with Government Code Section

23 65860,which requires that zoning ordinances shall be consistent with the General Plan.
24 B. 2016 GENERAL PLAN AND EIR'S TREATMENT OF GROUNDWATER ISSUE.

25 24. The 2016 General Plan acknowledges the groundwater overdraft situation. It states that

26 "[g]roundwater from individual wells represents a major water source in the county. In most of

27 Amador County, groundwater-bearing units and aquifers are poorly defined. The majority of
28 available groundwater is transient and found in fractured rock. This fractured bedrock aquifer has not

4
Petitionerg' Verificd Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

been adequately studied, and no information is available concerning the capacity of the aquifer. The
Cosumnes Groundwater Subbasin underlies southwestern Amador County. The Cosumnes Subbasin
2 is in overdraft; in other words, more water is leaving the groundwater basin than entering it."
3 25. The General Plan EIR analyzes overdraft as a continuing significant impact. It states: "The

4 Board finds that the provisions of Mitigation Measures 4.9-4a, 4.9-4b, 4.9-4c, and 4.9-1c have been

5 required in, or incorporated into, the General Plan. Implementation of Mitigation Measures 4.9-4a,
6 4.9-4b, 4.9-4c, and 4.9-1c would reduce the potential for impacts on groundwater levels, but not to
a less-than-significant level because the General Plan could still substantially deplete groundwater
8 supplies and interfere substantially with groundwater recharge."

9 26. The GP EIR concludes: "[Since the majority of groundwater use in the planning area would
10 continue to come from individual private wells, and data concerning groundwater yield is not
11 consistently available, and no additional feasible mitigation is available to reduce this impact to a
12 less-than-significant level, this impact would remain significant and unavoidable. Pursuant to CEQA
13 Guidelines Section 15091 (a)(3), the Board finds that specific economic, legal, social, technological,
14 or other considerations…..make infeasible certain mitigation measures or project alternatives identified
15 in the Final EIR."

16 C. INITIAL STUDY AND NEGATIVE DECLARATION

17 27. In July 2020, the County issued an initial study and negative declaration (IS/ND), which
18 found that the Project would have no potential for significant impacts. The IS/ND declines to find any
19 significant impacts occurring from the zoning change, stating that "no environmental factors [are]
20 potentially affected" and finds that "the proposed project COULD NOT have a significant effect on
21 the environment, and a NEGATIVE DECLARATION will be prepared."
22 28. Specific to groundwater and surface water supply, the IS/ND asks whether the Project will
23 "[s]ubstantially decrease groundwater supplies or interfere substantially with groundwater recharge
24 such that the project may impede sustainable groundwater management of the basin?" and answers:

25 "The project is unlikely to significantly impact groundwater supplies via extraction or the creation
26 of extensive hard surfaces which pose a barrier to recharge. At this time, there are no impacts to
27 groundwater." The IS/ND also states that the Project does not "[c]onflict with or obstruct
28 implementation of a water quality control plan or sustainable groundwater management plan" because

5
Potitioners' Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

"Amador County does not have a water quality control plan or sustainable groundwater management
plan" and thus "[n]o impact would result."

2 29. The IS/ND finds that "sufficient water supplies" are "available to serve the Project and
3 reasonably foreseeable future development during normal, dry and multiple dry years," because the
4 Project "is not located in an area of the County recognized as challenging in terms of groundwater
5 yield," and that the Project is unlikely to demand unusually high amounts of water."Based on the this,

6 the IS/ND find that, "[a]t this time, there are no impacts" due to a lack of available water supplies.
7 30. The IS/ND finds that the Project will have no cumulative impacts based on findings that "the
8 project is consistent with the County's General Plan land use projections. The land use and density
9 has been considered in the overall County growth. The analysis demonstrated that the project is in
10 compliance with all applicable state and local regulations. In addition, the project would not produce
11 impacts that considered with the effects of other past, present, and probable future projects, would
12 be cumulatively considerable becaus potential adverse environmental impacts were determined to
13 have no impact."

14 D. PROJECT APPROVAL AND COUNTY'S ADOPTION OF TIERING UNDER CEQA.
15 31. As part of the public review process, Petitioners submitted comments and new information
16 showing that the Cosumnes Subbasin ("Basin") is in a 10,000 acre feet ("AF") annual overdraft, that
17 the Foothills Plains subarea that includes Amador County and the Project area is in an estimated 1,000
18 AF annual overdraft, that the Foothills and Plains subareas are all part of one interconnected 'primary
19 aquifer,' in the which the Foothills subarea flows into the Plains subarea, and that alternative surface

20 water supply would require new or enlarged facilities, including a water treatment plant.
21 32. On October 13, 2020, the County Planning Commission held a public hearing on the Project,
22 and voted to recommend denial of the zoning change to the Board of Supervisors based on the
23 Commission's assessment that the negative declaration was inadequate and that the Project needed
24 a master plan for the entire 1,150 acres.
25 33. On December 12, 2020, County Counsel in a memo identified a new tiering approach as the
26 basis for not doing any analysis of the foreseeable environmental impacts from the zoning change.
27 County Counsel memo stated: "The Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND) is tiered off the General
28 Plan Environmental Impact Report (EIR). The General Plan EIR already identifies the uncertainty of

6
Petitioners' Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

water resources as a significant impact. The EIR mandates measures to mitigate these impacts, but
1 acknowledges that the impacts would remain significant and unavoidable." The County Counsel
2 memo adds that "the approval of the zone change would give rise to a CEQA violation only if the
3 Board finds (1) there are substantial changes to the project or to the circumstances under which the
4 project is being undertaken or new information not known at the time of the General Plan EIR (2) that
5
would require major revisions to the General Plan EIR." County Counsel concluded that "because
6 the groundwater impacts are already addressed and identified as significant and unavoidable in the
7 General Plan EIR, the two requirements triggering further environmental review are not met here."
8
34. On December 15, 2020, the Board held a hearing on the Project and approved an Ordinance
9 to change the zoning of the affected parcels from the R1A, Single Family Residential and Agricultural
10 District, to M-X, Manufacturing zoning district with Special Use X-combining district. In addition,
11 the Board found the negative declaration to be adequate under CEQA.
12
35. The Board's approval contains findings that "there is no substantial evidence that the project
13 will have a significant effect on the environment," "[t]here is no substantial new information which
14 was not known at the time of the General Plan Environmental Impact Report certification that
15 supports findings of new or more severe impacts than those addressed in the General Plan" and that
16 "[t]here are no identified significant impacts caused by this project, and therefore no corresponding
17 feasible mitigation measures identified in the General Plan Environmental Impact Report."
18
E. PETITIONERS' EXHAUSTION AND SERVICE ON ATTORNEY GENERAL.
19 36. During the administrative phase, Petitioners and their members, as well as other citizens,
20 submitted written and oral comments to the Planning Department, Planning Commission and Board
21 objecting to the Project and highlighting the deficiencies in the County's review of the Project's
22 environmental impacts and compliance with the County's General Plan.
23 37. On February 3, 2021, Petitioner's attorney faxed a Notice of Commencement of Action letter
24 to the County informing the County of Petitioners' intent to file a legal action challenging the
25 County's approval of the Project. (See Exhibit 1, attached hereto.)
26 38. On February 4, 2021, Petitioners' attorney mailed a copy of its Verified Petition to the
27 Attorney General's office to give notice of Petitioner's intent to bring this procceding as a private
28 attorney general under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. (See Exhibit 2, attached hereto.)

7
Petitioners' Verified Pctition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

V. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION (Violation of CEQA: Pub. Res. Code § 21168)

2 39. Petitioners incorporate by reference the allegations in the paragraphs set forth above.

3 40. The IS/ND does not actually conduct any CEQA cumulative impact analysis. Instead the

4 County's position is that because the GP EIR already found significant impacts, there is no need to

5 revisit the issue. However, here new information shows that a comprehensive study of the

6 groundwater basin shared by the Project reveals a large annual groundwater decline, that the Project

7 proposes manufacturing uses on over 1,000 acres, which will result in additional water demand, and

8 that there is no guarantee of surface water capacity for the area and that, since the 2016 General Plan
was enacted, the County has failed to follow through with promised mitigation.

10 41. The County's decision to tier off the General Plan EIR for water supply and groundwater

11 impacts as a way to not do any more review is contrary to CEQA, which does not allow an agency

12 to tier to a program EIR to avoid doing further CEQA review for an impact that the prior CEQA

13 review had found to be significant and unavoidable. Further, the new information shows the potential

14 for significant impacts that were not adequately addressed in the 2016 EIR for the General Plan. See

15 Pub. Res. Code $ 21166. For both these reasons, the County's failure to conduct further CEQA

16 analysis of the groundwater and overall water demand issues violates CEQA.

17 VI. SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
(Inconsistency with General Plan)
18 42. Petitioners incorporate by reference the allegations in the paragraphs set forth above.
19 43. The County's approval of the Project violates the General Plan. The Project creates a zoning
20 district, an MX, manufacturing with an overlay zone, which is not designated as one of the allowable
21 zoning districts in the General Plan, which instead lists acceptable zones as M, MM, LM & MR.
22 VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF
23 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:
24 1. For a Writ of Mandate ordering the County to (a) set aside its decision approving the
25 Project; (b) comply with CEQA and the County General Plan with respect to any further action taken
26 with respect to the Project; (c) take whatever additional action is necessary in conformance with the
27 Court's decision; and (d) file a return with the Court showing compliance with the writ of mandate.
28 Code Civ. Proc. § 1085.

8
Petitioners' Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

2. For preliminary and permanent injunctive relief precluding any development allowed
1 by the Project until the County has complied with applicable law;
2
3. For reasonable attorney's fees under Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5;
3 4. For costs of suit; and
4 5. For such other and further relief as the Court deems proper.
