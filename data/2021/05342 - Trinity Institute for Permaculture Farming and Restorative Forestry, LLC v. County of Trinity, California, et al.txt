VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 1. This action challenges the December 28, 2020 decision of the Board of Supervisors
2 ("Board") of the County of Trinity ("County," collectively "Respondents") to adopt an amended
3 Cannabis Program Ordinance No. 315-849 ("Ordinance") and certify the Program Environmental
4 Impact Report ("EIR") for the Ordinance (the "Project"). Respondents' approval was in violation of
5 the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), [Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.], the
6 CEQA Guidelines, [Title California Code of Regulations, ! 15000 et seq.], the State Planning and
7 Zoning Law, [Government Code $ 65300 et seq] as well as State Constitutional and Statutory law.

8 2. Respondents prepared and relied on an EIR that falls well below CEQA's minimum

9 standards.

10 3. Respondents have also failed to update the County's General Plan, and the Project
11 IS not consistent with the General Plan. The Land Use Element of the County's General Plan has not
12 been updated since 1988.

13 4. Petitioner requests that this Court vacate and set aside the Project and related
14 approvals and the certification of the EIR because Respondents failed to comply with CEQA and
15 applicable State Planning and Zoning Laws.

16 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

17 5. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to California Code of Civil
18 Procedure §§ 1085, 1094.5, 187 & 526, and Public Resources Code §§ 21168 and 21168.5. This
19 Court has the authority to issue a writ of mandate directing the County to vacate and set aside its
20 approval of the Project and certification of the EIR for the Project under the Code of Civil Procedure
21 §§ 1085 and 1094.5.

22 6. Venue for this action properly lies in the Trinity Superior Court because
23 Respondents and the Project are located in Trinity County.
24 THE PARTIES

25 7. Petitioner is the Trinity Institute for Permaculture Farming and Restorative Forestry,
26 LLC, that engages in county and state licensed commercial cannabis cultivation activity in Trinity
27 County. Petitioner was the first Enrollee in the North Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board
28 Cannabis Order in October 2015 and has been in consistent operation with the same general

2
AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 footprint, maintaining compliance with that Order and the successor General Order issued by the
2 State Water Board in 2017. Petitioner also entered into a Lake and Streambed Alteration Agreement
3| with the California Department of Fish & Wildlife in April 2016.
4 8. Petitioner commented on the Project on multiple occasions and would be directly,
5 adversely and irreparably affected by the Project and its components, as described herein, until and
6 unless this Court provides the relief prayed for in this petition. In addition to the Trinity County
7 commercial cannabis license it currently holds, Petitioner also has a pending Conditional Use Permit
8 application for additional licenses. Petitioner has met with County officials on numerous occasions
9 to address commercial cannabis issues.

10 9. Respondent COUNTY OF TRINITY ("County") is a local governmental agency
11 and political subdivision of the State of California charged with the authority to regulate and
12 administer land use activities within its boundaries, subject at all times to the obligations and
13 limitations of all applicable state, federal, and other laws, including CEQA and the CEQA
14 Guidelines and Planning and Zoning Laws. The Respondent also has the authority to legislate
15 changes to land use and policy within its jurisdiction. The Respondent is the lead agency under
16 CEQA for the preparation of the EIR and for the approval of the Project.
17 10. Respondent BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF TRINITY COUNTY (*Board") is the
18 legislative body for the County.

19 GENERAL FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
20 11. The Trinity County Cannabis Program has been in development for multiple years
21 and subjected to analysis under CEQA. Development of the Trinity County cannabis ordinance is a
22 "project" for CEQA purposes, and a Program Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") was prepared.

23 In accordance with CEQA Guidelines § 15168, this document is a program EIR that examines the
24 environmental impacts of a series of actions (e.g. issuing discretionary permits or zoning clearance

25 certificates). This type of EIR focuses on the changes in the environment that would result from the
26 issuance of rules, regulations, plans, or other general criteria attributable to a continuing program.
27 In accordance with CEQA Guidelines § 15168, a program EIR must examine the overall
28 environmental effects of the entire program and potential actions carried out as part of the program,

3
AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

including construction and operational activities.

2 12. The original Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR") was posted on May 29,
2019 and evaluated the physical environmental effects of the proposed Cannabis Program.
4 13. On November 11, 2020, a Final Environmental Impact Report (*FEIR") was posted,
which included responses to comments received on the DEIR and a revised DEIR.

6 14. On December 3, 2020, a divided Trinity County Planning Commission approved
7 Resolution No. PC 2020-13 (by a vote of 3-2) to recommend to the Board the adoption of the
8 Ordinance and Certification of the EIR, with certain identified modifications.

9 15. On December 21, 2020, the Board approved Resolution 2020-103 to adopt the
10 CEQA Findings of Fact and Statements of Overriding Consideration as well as the Mitigation and
11 Monitoring Program and certify the EIR.

12 16. On December 28, 2020, the Board adopted the revised Ordinance and posted a
13 Notice of Determination with the County Clerk concerning the adoption of the Commercial
14 Cannabis Program Ordinance.

15 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

16 17. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies by appearing at multiple
17 meetings of the Board to comment on the Project to Respondents to raise the issues presented herein.
18 Numerous other commenters also raised these and similar issues. All issues raised in this petition
19 were raised before Respondents by Petitioner, other members of the public, or public agencies prior
20 to approval of the Project.

21 18. Petitioner contends that Respondents were obligated to recirculate the EIR and
22 failed to do so, depriving Petitioner the opportunity to comment.

23 19. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this petition and
24 complaint and otherwise exhausted all administrative remedies in satisfaction of Public Resources
25 Code § 21177, including but not limited to appearing before the relevant agency, presenting
26 objections and submitting comments on the proposed ordinance, as well as on the agencies' permits,
27 approvals, procedures and authorizations. Petitioner complied with Public Resources Code con
28 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure § 388 by mailing a copy of this Petition to the California

4
AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Attorney General, a true and correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

2 20. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code 8 21167.5 by prior service of

3 a notice upon the County indicating their intent to file this Petition. Proof of Service of this
4 notification, with the notification, is attached as Exhibit B.

5 21. Petitioner has elected to prepare the record of proceedings in the above-captioned
6 proceeding or to pursue an alternative method of record preparation pursuant to Public Resources
7 Code § 21167.6(b)(2). Notification of the Election to Prepare the Administrative Record is attached

8 as Exhibit C.

9 22. This petition amends the original petition dated January 27, 2021 and timely filed in
10 accordance with Public Resources Code 21167 and CEQA Guidelines § 15112. That filing date
11 is hereby incorporated by reference.

12 23. Respondents have abused their discretion and failed to act as required by law in the
13 following ways:

14 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (VIOLATION OF CEQA; EIR Does Not Comply With CEQA)
16 24. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth
17 above.

18 25. CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project a be
19 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that a lead
20 agency provide an explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions it has reached.
21 26. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter of
22 law in that they violate a non-discretionary duty or requirement, are arbitrary and capricious or

23 otherwise are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including, but not limited to, the
24 following.

25

26 a. Failure to include a thorough description of the physical environmental conditions
27 at the time the Notice of Preparation was published, resulting in an inadequate baseline;
28 b. Relying on speculation regarding both baseline conditions and potential impacts

5
AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 from activities licensed under the Project;
2 C. Failure to thoroughly analyze the impacts of the Project, or lack thereof.
3 d. Failure to evaluate the environmental impacts of proposed Mitigation Measures and
4 to discuss their inconsistencies with other agencies.
5 e. Failure to recirculate the EIR.

6

7 Inadequate Baseline

8 27. CEQA Guidelines § 15125(a) provides that, "An EIR must include a description of

9 the physical environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project, as they exist at the time the
10 notice of preparation is published.... This environmental setting will normally constitute the
11 baseline physical conditions by which a lead agency determines whether an impact is significant."
12 28. CEQA Guidelines § 15126.2(a) further explains a lead agency's role in an EIR, "In
13 assessing the impact of a proposed project on the environment, the lead agency should normally
14 limit its examination to changes in the existing physical conditions in the affected area as they exist
15 at the time notice of preparation is published.

16 29. The Notice of Preparation was published on December 21, 2018. According to the
17 EIR, at that time there were 286 licensed commercial cannabis cultivation operations, including
18 Petitioner, in Trinity County. [EIR p. 3-1]

19 30. Additionally, the EIR identifies 3,927 cannabis grows in Trinity County in
20 December 2018, 93% of which were either illegal or unlicensed, or both.

21 31. The EIR does not differentiate between the baseline odor impacts of illegal and/or
22 unlicensed cannabis cultivation and the 286 licensed commercial cannabis cultivation operations
23 existing in December 2018.

24 32. The EIR does not establish baseline odor impact for personal medical and adult-use
25 cannabis cultivation countywide.

26 33. Lack of an adequate baseline precludes proper analysis of the potential odor impacts,
27 if any, of an additional 244 licensed commercial cannabis cultivation operations to the 3,927

28 cannabis cultivation sites existing in December 2018.

6
AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1

2 Relies on Speculation
34. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and allegation set forth above.
4 35. CEQA Guidelines § 15145 instructs that, "If, after thorough investigation, a Lead
Agency finds that particular impact is too speculative for evaluation, the agency should note its
6 conclusion and terminate discussion of the impact."
7 36. D2 15384 of the CEQA Guidelines defines "Substantial Evidence" as, "enough
8 | relevant information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be
to 9 made to support a conclusion...speculation, unsubstantiated opinion or narrative, evidence which is
10 clearly erroneous or inaccurate…does not constitute substantial evidence.»

11 37. In numerous sections, the EIR renders conclusions lacking substantial evidence and
12 based entirely on speculation, particularly those involving hazardous wastes and groundwater
13 resources:

14 a. In its discussion of hazardous materials, the EIR posits that, "Construction activities
15 that disturb subsurface materials could encounter previously unidentified
16 contamination from past practices, placement of undocumented fill, or even

17 authorized disposal of hazardous wastes. Encountering these materials could expose
18 workers, the public, or the environment to adverse effects depending on the volume,

19 materials involved, and concentrations." [EIR p. 3.9-14]
20 b. In discussing potential environmental impacts related to groundwater extraction, the
21 EIR states that, "No mapping of subsurface features, including fracture locations,
22 orientations, or depths, has been a completed on a countywide scale, nor would this
23 be feasible given that these are subsurface structures and are unique and variable
24 from location to location." [EIR p. 3.10-33]

25 c. The EIR also observes that, "it is not known if operation of wells for cannabis
26 operations over an extended period could result in isolated locations that affect the

27 operability of adjacent wells." [EIR p. 3.10-32]

28 38. Despite the evident uncertainty in the foregoing sections, each statement in the EIR

7
AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 precedes the imposition of extensive and costly Mitigation Measures to address the theoretical

2 potential for these uncertain impacts. [EIR Mitigation Measures 3.9-2a & 3.10-2 pp. 3.9-14 & 3.10-

3 34]

4 39. EIR. Mitigation Measure 3.9-2a requires commercial cannabis licensees proposing

5 construction activities on "commercial, business park or industrial sites" to conduct a Phase

6 Environmental Site Analysis (ESA) in accordance with ASTM E - 1527-05.
40. The EIR provides no evidence to support the existence of buried hazardous wastes
8 in commercial, business park nor industrial sites in Trinity County, instead merely speculating that
9 such materials might exist.

10 41. While simultaneously acknowledging that it lacks sufficient evidence to determine
11 baseline subsurface hydrological conditions, the EIR imposes Mitigation Measure 3.10-2 that

12 requires:

13 [A]pplicants shall provide the County with groundwater monitoring data for
14 existing on-site well facilities that documents well production and changes in groundwater levels during each month of the year. Should this monitoring data 15 identify potential drawdown impacts on adjacent well(s), surface waters, and
16 waters of the state and sensitive habitats, and indicate a connection to operation of the on-site wells, the cannabis operators, in conjunction with the County, shall
17 develop adaptive management measures to allow for recovery of groundwater levels that would protect adjacent wells and habitat conditions that could be
18 adversely affected by declining groundwater levels. Adaptive management

19 measures may include forbearance (e.g., prohibition of groundwater extraction
from the months of May to October), water conservation measures, reductions in on-site cannabis cultivation, alteration of the groundwater pumping schedule, or 20 other measures determined appropriate. Adaptive management measures will
21 remain in place until groundwater levels have recovered and stabilized based on
annual monitoring data provided to the County. [EIR p. 3.10-34]
22 42. Mitigation Measure 3.10-2, purports to mitigate speculative environmental impacts,
23 but fails to identify how the data could be analyzed or how hydraulic connectivity could be
24 established to distinguish potential Project impacts from baseline conditions, that are admittedly
25 speculative.
26 43. CEQA Guidelines 8 15364 defines "Feasible" as "capable of being accomplished in
27 a successful manner within a reasonable period of time, taking into account economic
28 environmental, legal, social, and technological factors." The EIR admits that mapping the
8
AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 subsurface hydrology of Trinity County is "not feasible." [EIR p. 3.10-33]
2

3 Failure to Analyze

4 44. CEQA requires a lead agency for a project to prepare an EIR that complies with the
5 requirements of the statute. The lead agency must also provide for public review and comment on
6 the project and associated environmental documentation. An EIR must provide sufficient
7 environmental analysis such that decision-makers can intelligently consider environmental
8 consequences when acting on proposed projects.

9 45. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying an EIR for the Project that is inadequate
10 and fails to comply with CEQA.

11 46. In particular, the EIR failed to analyze the cumulative impacts of the Ordinance's
12 purported prohibition on "stacking" of cannabis licenses; i.e., allowing more than one license per
13 parcel or per person.
14 47. Although the Final EIR acknowledges the potential to regulate stacking, it fails to
15 conduct any analysis of the cumulative impact of prohibiting (or not) stacking, and does not analyze
16 the Ordinance as actually adopted that does prohibit stacking more than one license on a parcel.
17 48. The EIR analyzes limits on the total number of commercial cannabis licenses in the
18 County. The EIR analyzes a limit of 530 total licenses. It did not, however, consider the
19 environmental impacts or alternatives as to whether those licenses should be spread across 530
20 separate parcels in the County, or whether allowing (or requiring) multiple licenses per parcel would
21 concentrate commercial cannabis development on a smaller number a of parcels, and in so doing
22 reduce the potential environmental impacts of the Project.

23 49. Despite the failure to conduct any environmental analysis as to whether prohibiting
24 stacking would contribute to environmental impacts, the County adopted in the Ordinance a
25 limitation that only one license could be granted per parcel, necessitating that the impacts of the
26 Project would be distributed across 530 separate parcels.

27 50. The EIR failed to weigh numerous environmental impacts of prohibiting stacking
28 of cannabis licenses, including but not limited to traffic, aesthetics, noise, odors, or other impacts of

9
AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1| spreading licenses across 530 separate parcels.

2 51. The EIR failed to consider an alternative to the project that expressly permitted or
3 required stacking of licenses.

52. Respondents failed to make any findings that prohibiting stacking was a superior
environmental alternative, that prohibiting stacking did not have a significant impact on the
6 environment, or whether permitting stacking would mitigate for environmental impacts of the
7 Project.

53. Respondents' decision to prohibit stacking in the Ordinance is not supported by
substantial evidence in the record.

10 54. Respondents failed to analyze the cumulative programmatic impacts of prohibiting
11 stacking, the EIR:

12 a. Failed to adequately disclose or analyze the Project's significant impacts on the
13 environment, including but not limited to, the Project's impacts on water supply, hydrology
14 and water quality, biological resources, traffic, air quality, aesthetics, public services and
15 utilities;

16 b. Failed to provide an adequate description of the Project;
17 C. Failed to adequately analyze the significant cumulative impacts of the Project;
18 d. Improperly deferred impact analysis and mitigation measures;

19 e. Failed to adequately mitigate Project impacts; and
20 f. Failed to consider a reasonable range of alternatives.

21 55. Petitioner is informed, and does so believe, that a substantial portion of the fees

22 collected by Respondents as part of the Project are allocated directly to fund the abatement by

23 Respondents, and its agents and assigns, of illegal and/or unlicensed cannabis cultivation sites in

24 Trinity County.

25 56. Petitioner is further informed, and does so believe, that since December 2018
26 hundreds of illegal and/or unlicensed cannabis cultivation sites in Trinity County have been abated
27 using funds raised by the Project.

28 57. The reduction in the number of illegal and/or unlicensed cannabis cultivation

10
AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

activities in Trinity County reduces the corresponding impacts of those activities, particularly as

2 regards odor, road wear & fugitive dust, water use & quality, hazardous materials and sensitive
habitats & species; rendering the Project itself as mitigation of these environmental impacts.
58. Despite substantial evidence, the EIR fails to acknowledge the reduction in
environmental impacts, let alone analyze how those reductions offset actual and anticipated impacts

6 of the commercial cannabis activities licensed under the Project.

7 59. In the discussion of Mitigation Measure 3.9-2a, the EIR fails to analyze why
8 potential impacts from construction activities licensed under the Project would be different from
9 any other construction activities in Trinity County.

10 60. CDFA regulations for commercial cannabis licensing require: "Evidence that the

11 applicant has conducted a hazardous materials record search of the EnviroStor database for the

12 proposed premises. If hazardous sites were encountered, the applicant shall provide documentation

13 of protocols implemented to protect employee health and safety." [3 CCR § 8102(q)]
14 61. The EIR neither acknowledges this CDFA regulation, nor analyzes how this
15 requirement would mitigate any potential impacts from legacy hazardous wastes, were they to exist.

16

17 Failure to Evaluate Impacts of Mitigation Measures and Discuss Inconsistencies

18 62. Mitigation Measure 3.14-3 requires that, "Applications for new commercial
19 cannabis activities and license renewals for existing cannabis operations shall provide
20 documentation showing that roadways providing site access are is in compliance with Chapter

21 12.10: Design Policies of the Trinity County Code of Ordinances." [EIR p. 3.14-17]

22 63. The EIR fails to point out that Trinity County Code § 12.10.020 states that, "The

23 policy and standards adopted in this chapter shall only apply to construction and reconstruction of

24 county highways, streets and roads either performed by or contracted through the Trinity County

25 department of transportation."

26 64. Mitigation Measure 3.14-4 requires that, "Applications for new commercial
27 cannabis activities and license renewals for existing cannabis operations shall provide
28 documentation showing that site access is in compliance with Chapter 8.30 - Fire Safe Ordinance

11
AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

of the Trinity County Code." [EIR p. 3.14-18]

65. While the EIR does mention that Trinity County Code Chapter 8.30 does not apply
to existing roads, it fails to identify the specific exemption for "roads for agricultural or mining use

4 solely on one ownership." [T.C. Code § 8.30.030]

66. The EIR imposes Mitigation Measures 3.14-3 & 3.14-4 based on no evidence other
6 than "Field review of existing cannabis cultivation sites." The EIR is devoid of any detail regarding
7 the number of sites visited, the time of year the observations were made, the specific conditions
8 observed, nor the professional qualifications of the observers. [EIR pp. 3.14-16 to 3.14-18]

9 67. The EIR list of references for Chapter 3-14 (Transportation) does not include any
10 materials that addresses either Mitigation Measure 3.14-3 or 3.14-4. [EIR pp. 8-11 to 8-12]
11 68. CEQA Guidelines § 15126.4(a)(1)(D) directs that, "If a mitigation measure would
12 cause one or more significant impacts…the effects of the mitigation measure shall be discussed."
13 69. The EIR fails to adequately analyze the impacts of new and existing private access
14 roads and instead adopted Mitigation Measures 3.14-3 & 3.14-4 that are likely to result in hundreds

15 of miles of new road construction and accompanying tree removal and grading.
16 70. The environmental impacts associated with hundreds of miles of road construction
17 throughout the county are significant and include every CEQA category.
18 71. Reconstruction of existing access roads would invariably require the removal of
19 commercial timber, requiring approval from CALFire, which approval is likely not feasible in most

20 cases.

21 72. CEQA Guidelines § 15125 (d) specifies that, "The EIR shall discuss any
22 inconsistencies between the proposed project…and regional plans [that] include, but are not limited
23 to...area-wide waste treatment and water quality control plans."

24 73. The State Water Board Order WQ 2019-0001-DWQ addresses, in detail, the
25 potential environmental impacts of roads associated with commercial cannabis cultivation activities

26 and includes 15 requirements to mitigate those findings. [SWB Cannabis Cultivation Policy,
27 Attachment A: Definitions and Requirements for Cannabis Cultivation]

28 74. The State Water Board Order requires roads associated with commercial cannabis

12
AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 activity to meet the standards of The Road Handbook (CCR Title 14, Chap. 4).

2 75. The State Water Board's Comment Letter to the Draft EIR states that, "Per the
3 Order, access roads should be constructed consistent with the requirements of...The Road

4 Handbook. Existing access roads should be upgraded to comply with The Road Handbook…..
5 Likewise, new road design should be consistent with The Road Handbook." [EIR p. 3-19]

6 76. The EIR. fails to discuss the inconsistencies between Mitigation Measures 3.14-3 &
7 3.14-4 and the requirements of the SWB Order.

8

9

10 Failure to Recirculate EIR

11 77. CEQA requires that if significant new information is added to an EIR after a draft

12 EIR is prepared, but before certification of the final EIR, the EIR must be recirculated for public

13 review and comment.

14 78. A determination to prohibit stacking was made prior to certification of the final EIR.

15 Despite the availability of this significant new information, resulting in a significantly changed

16 project, Respondents failed to recirculate the EIR, or any portion of the EIR. As a result of

17 Respondents' failure to recirculate the EIR, the public and other public agencies were deprived of

18 any meaningful opportunity to review and comment on the Project, its substantial adverse

19 environmental consequences, and the new information regarding other unanalyzed environmental
20 effects of the Project.

21 79. The Ordinance provides the following new provision of Trinity County Code:

22 "17.43.030 G. Only one application countywide may be submitted per legal parcel." This

23 provision was codified in the December 28, 2020 ordinance, but as the "Drafting Note" makes

24 clear, it was actually adopted "by Ordinance No. 315-848, approved by the Board of Supervisors

25 on December 15, 2020." The provision was reiterated in Ordinance 315-849 solely to ensure it was

26 codified into the Trinity County Code. Id.

27 80. Prior to this change County code had permitted more than one permit per legal
28 parcel, known as "stacking."

13
AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 81. The Draft EIR entirely failed to analyze stacking of licenses.

2 82. The Final EIR (Volume I) contains the following discussion regarding stacking:
3 2.1.4 Stacking Multiple Licenses on a Single Parcel
A Ur Stacking of multiple licenses on a single parcel, also referred to as Stacking Licenses, may be allowed in the Cannabis Program. Specific provisions may be established as part of a Stacking License program, if adopted. Provisions may
6 include physical elements, such as setbacks, minimum or maximum limits on total acreage of commercial cannabis operations or canopy, parcel size, site suitability,
7 existing infrastructure or disturbance, consolidation of infrastructure, new disturbance, or any other physical elements that may be applicable. Other provisions
8 may be operational or administrative, such as cannabis waste disposal, shared use facilities, number of licenses, transfers, multiple licenses operated on one parcel by
1o different licensees, multiple licenses on more than one contiguous legal parcel in which parcels are under identical ownership, Use Permit requirements, status of
10 applicants as existing licensees, types of licenses, considerations if an established license cap is in place, applicant compliance record, or any other administrative or
11 operational elements that may be applicable.

12 These provisions may be adopted based on consideration of factors such as public input, population size or density, environmental and topographic elements,
13 infrastructure, utilities, safety, existing illegal cannabis operations or abandoned cultivation sites, proximity to sensitive receptors, General Plan designations and
14 zoning, parcel size, nearby land uses, existing licensed commercial cannabis operations, neighboring cannabis cultivation activities, and other considerations that
15 are relevant to adoption of a Stacking License program and associated provisions.
ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSIS 16

17 The EIR programmatically evaluates the environmental impacts of implementing the Cannabis Program countywide and does not specify individual parcels that may
18 be used for commercial cannabis uses in the future. Stacking Licenses would be required to comply with Cannabis Program performance standards, EIR mitigation
19 measures, and applicable State cannabis regulations (e.g., CalCannabis and SWRCB Order WQ 2019-0001-DWQ) identified in DEIR Sections 3.1 through 3.15 that
20 address environmental impacts, such as odor, noise, lighting, geologic stability, biological resources, and water resources. Thus, these provisions would not create a
21 new significant impact or result in an increase in severity of significant impacts identified in the DEIR.

22 83. This discussion in the Final EIR is defective in numerous ways, including that:

23 a. The decision to prohibit stacking had already been made prior to certification of the
24 EIR; and

failure to ..... 25 b. The "Environmental Analysis" regarding stacking was rather an express
26 evaluate the cumulative environmental impacts of stacking or the prohibition thereof.
27 84. The determination to prohibit stacking was substantial new information regarding

AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 was deprived of the opportunity to comment on the environmental impacts of the prohibitions on
2 stacking that were added in the Ordinance only after the Final EIR was published on November 11,
3 2020.

4 85. Actual analysis of the stacking determination was required to determine, on a
5 program level, the cumulative impact of prohibiting stacking and thus requiring the dispersal of
6 every license to a separate parcel in the County, rather than concentrate development on fewer
7 || parcels.

8 86. The "Environmental Analysis" provided of stacking does not address the impacts of
9 broader distribution of licenses than would otherwise occur on any environmental factors.
10 Distributing the licenses more broadly however has the clear potential to impact a diverse array of
11 environmental factors, including impacts to traffic, aesthetics, odor, noise, water and hydrologic
12 resources.

13 87. The EIR did not consider as an alternative to the Project specifically allowing (or
14 requiring) stacking in order to limit the number of parcels to be impacted by development under the
15 Project. Despite the Draft EIR discussing the potential for regulation of stacking, and the Final EIR
16 failing to be adjusted for the actual state of the regulations in that regard at the time of certification,
17 the EIR failed to analyze the alternative that the stacking prohibition not be adopted. Because
18 allowing stacking has the effect on concentrating development on fewer parcels and leading to fewer
19 total development projects, a reasonable range of alternatives with lesser environmental impacts
20 should have been considered prior to the determination to prohibit stacking.

21 88. Respondents' failure to recirculate the EIR is not supported by substantial evidence
22 and represents a failure to proceed in the manner required by law.

23 89. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
24 discretion by certifying an EIR that does not comply with CEQA and by approving the Project in
25 reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of the Project
26 must be set aside.

AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violations of CEQA & State Law; Ordinance Provisions violate CEQA and state law)

90. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth
4 above,

91. CEQA Guidelines 15131 (a) provides that "Economic or social effects of a project
6 shall not be treated as significant effects on the environment."

7 92. The EIR states that, "Stacking Licenses would be required to comply with Cannabis
8 Program performance standards, EIR mitigation measures, and applicable State cannabis
9 regulations.... Thus, these provisions would not create a new significant impact or result in an
10 increase in severity of significant impacts identified in the DEIR."

11 93. In the absence of any potential environmental impacts, as evidenced by the EIR,
12 Ordinance 315-849, adopted by Respondent Board of Supervisors, on December 28, 2020 lacks any
13 findings that support its prohibition on stacking licenses in violation of Government Code $ 65850
14 et.seq.

15

16 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

17 (Violation of California Constitutional and Statutory Law; preemption)
18 94. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth

19 above.

20 95. PRC § 21004 provides that, "In mitigating or avoiding a significant effect of a
21 project on the environment, a public agency may exercise only those express or implied powers
22 provided by law other than this division."

23 96. As further articulated in CEQA Guideline § 15040(b), "CEQA does not grant
24 agency new powers independent of other laws." Mitigation measures must be constitutional and

25 legally imposed. [CEQA Guidelines § 15126.4 (4 &5)]

26 97. The State Water Board has exclusive jurisdiction over water rights in California.

27 [Water Code § 174 et.seq.]

28 98. The State Water Board's authority does not extend to groundwater other than that

16
AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 in a "known and defined channel." [Water Code § 1200, California Constitution Art. 10 § 2]

2 99. Trinity County is preempted by the State Water Board and lacks the legal authority

3 to impose Mitigation Measure 3.10-2a.

4 100. Mitigation Measure 3.10-2a should be stricken in accordance with CEQA

5 Guidelines § 15126.4 (5) [*If the lead agency determines that a mitigation measure cannot be

6 legally imposed, the measure need not be proposed or analyzed. Instead, the EIR may simply

7 reference the fact and briefly explain the reasons underlying the lead agency's determination."].

8

9 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Violations of State Planning and Zoning Law)
11 101. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth
12 above.

13 102. Government Code section 65300 requires the legislative body of a county to adopt
14 a general plan for the physical development of the county. The general plan is often called a
15 "constitution" for future development to which all other land use decisions must conform.
16 103. Accordingly, any decision of the County affecting land use and development,
17 including development of the zoning code, must be consistent with the general plan.

18 104. The Project is inconsistent with the County General Plan because, among other
19 reasons, the General Plan calls for "Prime agriculture lands [to] be preserved for agricultural
20 II production. It is important that these areas are kept in acreage large enough to secure their economic
21 viability." Prohibiting stacking is inconsistent with and undermines this policy.

22 105. Accordingly, approval of the Project must be set aside.

23 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

24 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as follows:

25 A. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate, commanding Respondents:

26 (1) to vacate and set aside approval of the Ordinance, including any prior purported
27 adoption of a prohibition on stacking;

28 (2) to vacate and set aside certification of the Final EIR for the Project;

17
AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1

2 (3) to prepare and certify a legally adequate EIR for the Project;

3 B. To suspend enforcement of the prohibition on stacking of cannabis licenses pursuant to
the Ordinance;
A C. For costs of the suit;

5

6 D. For attorney's fees pursuant to the Code of Civil Procedure section 1021 .5: and

7 E. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
