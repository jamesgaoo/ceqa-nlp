25 INTRODUCTION

26 1. This action challenges the decision of the California Department of Transportation
27 ("Caltrans" or "Respondent") to approve the SR 70 Binney Junction Roadway Rehabilitation
28| and Complete Streets Project ("Project") based on a Final Environmental Impact Report ("EIR")

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

pursuant to, the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code section
2 21000 et seq., and a Final Environmental Assessment ("EA"), pursuant to the National

3 Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. section 4321 et seq., in a joint document. The challenged

4 Project involves approval of changes to State Route 70 ("SR 70") in the heart of the City of
5 Marysville, including constructing two additional traffic storage lanes with associated shoulders

6 and sidewalks, replacing and lengthening two existing railroad structures, lowering the existing
7 SR 70 under two overpasses, removal of existing access to and from 17th Street, relocation of an

8 existing levee, signalization of two existing intersections, and rehabilitation of existing
9 pavement.

10 2. As Petitioner City of Marysville ("Petitioner" or "City") stated in comments on the
11 EIR, the Project is expected to have significant individual and cumulative environmental effects,
12 including air quality, traffic, noise, and land use impacts as well as impacts on emergency access
13 and emergency response and utilities. Yet the EIR fails to disclose or adequately analyze these
14 environmental impacts or identify any mitigation measures for adoption, rendering the EIR
15 inadequate under CEQA. The Draft EIR also did not identify the proposed project, and the EIR
16 inadequately describes the environmental setting and entirely defers certain analyses including
17 analysis of impacts to cultural resources.
18 3. As explained in detail below, Caltrans's action in approving the Project based on
19 an incomplete and otherwise deficient EIR that is unsupported by substantial evidence violates
20 CEQA and the State CEQA Guidelines, California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15000
21 et seq. ("CEQA Guidelines"). Specifically, Respondent certified an EIR for the Project that fails

22 to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's significant individual or cumulative
23 environmental effects.

24 4. For all of these reasons, Respondent's approval of the Project and certification of
25 the EIR must be rescinded.

26 PARTIES

27 5. Petitioner City of Marysville is a charter city located in the County of Yuba in the
28 State of California. Marysville is bisected by SR 70 and will be adversely affected by the
2
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Project's air quality, traffic, noise, land use, emergency access, utilities and other environmental
2 impacts.

3 6. Respondent Caltrans is an agency of the State of California, and is the CEQA
4| "lead agency" as defined in Public Resources Code section 21067 with principal responsibility
5 for carrying out and approving the Project.

6 7. Real Party in Interest County of Yuba is a political subdivision of the State of
7 California. Caltrans's Notice of Determination ("NOD") for the Project states that the Project is
8 proposed to be conducted in cooperation with the County of Yuba, and Petitioner is therefore

9 informed and believes that the County of Yuba is a Real Party in Interest pursuant to Public
10 Resources Code section 21167.6.5(a).

11 8. Real Party in Interest Union Pacific Railroad Company ("Union Pacific Railroad")
12 is a Delaware corporation doing business in California. Caltrans's NOD for the Project states
13 that the is Project is proposed to be conducted in cooperation with Union Pacific Railroad, and
14 Petitioner is therefore informed and believes that Union Pacific Railroad is a Real Party in
15 Interest pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5(a).
16 9. Petitioner does not know the true names and capacities, whether individual,
17 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of respondents DOES 1 through 50, inclusive, and therefore
18 sues said respondents under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition to show their
19 true names and capacities when the same have been ascertained. Each of the respondents is the
20 agent and/or employee of Respondent Caltrans, and each performed acts on which this action is
21 based within the course and scope of such respondent's agency and/or employment.
22 10. Petitioner does not know the true names and capacities, whether individual,
23 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of real parties in interest DOES 51 through 100, inclusive,
24 and therefore sues said real parties in interest under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this
25 Petition to show their true names and capacities when the same have been ascertained.

26 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

27 11. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to
28 Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 (alternatively section 1085) and Public Resources Code
3
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 sections 21168, 21168.5 and 21168.9.

2 12. Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of action alleged in this Petition

3 arose in the County of Yuba where the site of the proposed Project is located.

4 13. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
5 21167.5 by serving written notice of Petitioner's intention to commence this action on Caltrans
6 on January 4, 2021. A copy of the written notice and proof of service is attached hereto as

7 Exhibit A.

8 14. Petitioner is concurrently complying with the requirements of Public Resources

9 Code section 21167.6 by concurrently filing a notice of its intent to prepare the administrative
10 record for this action.

11 15. Petitioner is sending a copy of this Petition to the California Attorney General
12 concurrently with filing this action, thereby complying with the requirements of Public
13 Resources Code section 21167.7. A copy of this written notice is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

14 16. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant
15 action and has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by
16 law, including but not limited to timely submitting comments on the Draft EIR and the Project
17 to Caltrans on or around October 30, 2020.

18 17. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
19  unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Caltrans to set aside its
20 approval of the project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondent's approval will remain in
21 effect in violation of state law.

22 STATEMENT OF FACTS

23 Project Location and Description

24 18. SR 70 is a freeway connecting State Route 99 north of Sacramento with U.S.
25 Route 395 just west of the California-Nevada border. Within Marysville, SR 70 intersects with
26 State Route 20, which connects Marysville with Yuba City to the west and Grass Valley to the
27 east. Within the Project area, SR 70 consists of two twelve-foot lanes.

28 19. SR 70, and the Project, cut north/south through the heart of Marysville. Marysville
4
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

is a small city, roughly two miles in length between its northern and southern borders. The
2 Project, bordered by businesses, residences, parks, and Marysville High School, among other
3 places, would impact nearly half of those two miles. The design of the Project is therefore

4 critical to the quality of life of Marysville's residents, including their ability to access homes and
businesses, their experience of noise levels and traffic congestion in and around the Project area,

6 and negative impacts to emergency response times and emergency access throughout the City.
20. Among other things, the Project would widen SR 70, adding between one and two
additional lanes in each direction depending on. the area. This widening will necessitate the

9 removal of businesses, trees, at least one residence, and public buildings, including a youth
10 community center and a transit center. Construction of the is Project is expected to take between 8-
11 10 years, and will require both temporary and permanent street closures.
12 Environmental Review for the Project

13 21. On or about May 26, 2020, Caltrans filed a Notice of Preparation of a Draft
14 Environmental Impact Report for the Project ("NOP").

15 22. The Final EIR states that the Draft EIR was made available for review on
16 September 18, 2020, although the California Office of Planning and Research's ("OPR")
17 CEQANet website states that the Draft EIR was received by OPR on September 21, 2020.
18 23. In a letter dated October 30, 2020, Petitioner commented on the Draft EIR and
19 requested that it include more information to help the public understand the Project's true
20 impacts. Among other comments, Petitioner noted that the Draft EIR failed to adequately
21 describe the proposed Project, failed to describe or discuss feasible mitigation measures, and
22 failed to analyze the Project's many environmental impacts, including inconsistency with the
23 City's General Plan, traffic impacts, and the impacts of displacing homes and businesses in
24 Marysville.

25 24. Numerous other members of the public and public agencies submitted comments
26 to Caltrans addressing the inadequacy of the Draft EIR, including individual Marysville
27 residents and small business owners, local community groups, the Yuba-Sutter Transit
28 Authority, and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.
5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 25. On or about December 10, 2020, Caltrans emailed Nicole Moe, City of Marysville
2 City Clerk, and requested the City to post the Final EIR on the City's website. The email failed

3 to inform the City that Caltrans had already approved the Project and filed the NOD for the
4 Project approval on December 7, 2020. On December 15, 2020, the City's consulting planner,
Kathy Pease, with Management Advisory Services, emailed Caltrans, requesting information on
6 the status of the Project. Caltrans never responded. Given Caltrans's misleading silence, the City
7 reasonably inferred that Caltrans had not yet approved the Project. Copies of the December 10,
8 2020, and December 15, 2020, emails are attached hereto as Exhibits C and D, respectively.
26. Because the City was unaware, due to Caltrans's failure to notify or inform the
10 City, that the Project had been approved, the City filed a second comment letter dated December
11 17, 2020, which was within 10 days of the City having learned that the Final EIR had been
12 issued. The City's letter explained that Caltrans had failed to adequately respond to its
13 comments on the Draft EIR, and that the inadequacies in the Draft EIR therefore still existed and
14 had not been remedied or addressed in the Final EIR. Caltrans confirmed by email on December
15 17, 2020, that it had received the City's letter, but once again failed to tell the City that it had
16 already approved the Project and filed the NOD. A copy of the December 17, 2020, email is
17 attached hereto as Exhibit E.

18 27. The City, still inferring based on Caltrans's silence that the Project had not been
19 approved and the NOD not been filed, emailed Caltrans on December 18, 2020, asking whether
20 Caltrans was amenable to delaying the filing of the NOD, and suggesting settlement discussions
21 between the City and Caltrans. Caltrans again failed to respond to the City's email. A copy of

22 the December 18, 2020, email is attached hereto as Exhibit F.

23 28. Thereafter, on December 18, 2020, the City learned by checking OPR's CEQANet
24 website that Caltrans had submitted the Final EIR and filed the NOD with OPR on December 7,

25 2020.

26 29. Finally, on December 21, 2020, 11 days after its initial correspondence with the
27 City, Caltrans informed the City by email that it had already filed the NOD. Although Caltrans
28 represented in this email that it filed the NOD on December 11, 2020, OPR's CEQANet website
6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- shows that it was in fact filed on December 7, 2020. A copy of the December 21, 2020, email is
2 attached hereto as Exhibit G.

3 30. Petitioner is informed, and on that basis believes, that Caltrans certified the Final
4 EIR on or about the date of its release, December 7, 2020.

5 31. Caltrans included responses to comments in the Final EIR, but did not at any time
6 in advance of certifying the Final EIR and approving the Project, much less 10 days in advance,
7 provide the City with written responses to its comments on the Draft EIR.

8

9 CAUSE OF ACTION

10 32. (Violations of CEQA)
Petitioner incorporates by reference all of the allegations contained in the previous
11 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.
12 33. CEQA requires the lead agency for a project with the potential to cause significant
13 environmental effects (impacts) to prepare an EIR that complies with the requirements of CEQA
14. and the CEQA Guidelines, including but not limited to the requirement to analyze the project's
15 potentially significant environmental impacts. The EIR must provide sufficient environmental
16 analysis such that the decisionmakers can intelligently consider environmental consequences
17 when acting on the proposed project. The EIR also must identify feasible mitigation measures to
18 reduce or avoid the project's significant environmental impacts, as well as analyze a reasonable
19 range of alternatives to the proposed project.
20 34. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency adopt all feasible mitigation measures
21 that would reduce or avoid any of the project's significant environmental impacts. If any of the
22 project's significant environmental impacts cannot be mitigated to a less a than significant level,
23 then CEQA bars the lead agency from approving a project if a feasible alternative is available
24 that would meet the project's objectives while avoiding or reducing is significant environmental
25 impacts.

26 35. CEQA also mandates that no lead agency may approve a project for which an EIR
27 was certified unless it makes one or more of the following findings with respect to each
28 significant environmental effect of the project: (a) changes or alterations have been required in,

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 7

1 or incorporated into, the project which mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the

2 environments; (b) those changes or alterations are within the responsibility and jurisdiction of
3 another public agency and have been, or can and should be, adopted by that other agency; (c)

4 specific economic, legal, social, technological or other considerations make infeasible the
5 mitigation measures or alternatives identified in the EIR. Furthermore, the lead agency may

6 approve a project that would have significant, unavoidable impacts on the environment only if
7 the agency finds that the project's benefits would outweigh its unavoidable impacts.

8 36. Under CEQA, all findings required for an agency's approval of a project must be
9 legally adequate and supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record, and CEQA
10 further requires that an agency provide an explanation of how the evidence in the record
11 supports the conclusions the agency has reached.
12 37. Respondent failed to proceed in a manner required by law and violated CEQA by
13 certifying an EIR that is inadequate and fails to comply with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines
14 in numerous respects. The inadequacies include, but are not limited to the following:
15 a. The Draft EIR fails to disclose or describe the proposed project, as required
16 by CEQA Guidelines sections 15120(c) and 15124, thereby precluding informed review and
17 comment during the public review and comment period by the public. Moreover, the alternatives
18 that are identified in the Draft EIR are lacking in basic details that are necessary to disclose the
19 impacts of the Project.

20 b. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's significant
21 individual and cumulative impacts to air quality, including impacts to the health and welfare of
22 residents and employees who live and work adjacent to the Project site. For example, the EIR
23 fails to analyze air quality impacts due to Project construction traffic and undisclosed amounts
24 of grading and earth moving proposed, and increased traffic that will occur due to the expansion
25 of SR 70.

26 C. The EIR incorrectly concludes that the Project would not divide an
27 established community even though it would bisect Marysville and require temporary and
28 permanent street closures, and a as a result fails to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's
8
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

significant land use impacts.

d. The EIR incorrectly concludes that the Project would not conflict with land
use plans and policies, even though the Project will require the removal of at least eight

4 structures, including five businesses, a community center, a transit center, and at least one
5 residence, and as a result fails to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's significant land

6 use and associated impacts.

e. The EIR also fails to discuss the project's consistency with any General

8 Plan policies that are not in the City of Marysville General Plan Housing Element, thereby

9 foregoing entirely analysis of consistency with applicable General Plan policies such as policies
10 applicable to noise and land use impacts.
11 f. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's significant
12 traffic and transportation impacts due to closing existing roadways and intersections, including
13 removing access to and from 17th Street which will be turned into a cul-de-sac, removal of an
14 existing pedestrian tunnel, and diverting traffic on to or increasing traffic on local streets.
15 g. The EIR fails to adequately analyze the impacts on emergency access and
16 emergency response plans due the Project's cutting off direct access to the existing Fire Station,
17 which is located approximately 0.5 miles south of the Project. Despite the fact that local streets
18 and intersections will be closed, the EIR fails to analyze Project's impacts on emergency
19 response times.
20 h. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's significant
21 impacts due to increased traffic noise levels in excess of the noise standards established in the

22 City's General Plan.

23 i. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's significant
24 impacts on water quality and hydrology due to run off from the Project's increase in impervious
25 surfaces.

26 •R The EIR fails to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's significant
27 impacts on utilities and services due to construction-related utility relocation and service
28 interruptions, nor does the Project description describe how these relocations and replacement
9
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 services will be accomplished.

2 k. The EIR fails to identify, and Caltrans failed to adopt, any mitigation
measures despite the fact that the EIR acknowledges that Project environmental effects would
4 occur in the areas of community impacts, traffic and transportation, aesthetics, hydrology and
water quality, hazardous materials, air quality, noise and vibration, wetlands and waters of the
6 United States, and biological resources, and in the additional areas alleged above, but concludes

7 that impacts will not occur or will be less than significant due to reliance on measures such as a
8 Traffic Management Plan that are not considered to be mitigation measures and, therefore, will
9 not be monitored or enforced through a mitigation monitoring or reporting program as required
10 by CEQA Guidelines section 15126.4(a)(2).

11 1. The EIR fails to adequately analyze, disclose, or mitigate climate change
12 impacts caused by the Project's greenhouse gas ("GHG") cmissions by, for example, failing to
13 quantify or analyze the Project's construction-related GHG emissions, and failing to identify
14 adequate mitigation for the Project's climate change impacts.

15 m. The EIR fails to provide adequate analysis of, and mitigation for, the
16 Project's growth-inducing impacts. For example, the EIR fails to support with substantial

17 evidence its assumption that widening SR 70 will not induce growth. Because the Project will
18 increase traffic capacity on SR 70, the Project has the potential to induce growth; therefore,
19 Caltrans was required to analyze the secondary effects of this growth on environmental
20 resources in and around the Project area. The EIR's failure to analyze the environmental impacts
21 resulting from the Project's inducement of growth violates CEQA.

22 n. The EIR fails to respond to public comments on the adequacy of the EIR as
23 required by Public Resources Code section 21091(d) and CEQA Guidelines section 15088(a).
24 38. CEQA requires the lead agency to provide public agencies that comment on a

25 draft EIR with written responses to its comments at least 10 days prior to certifying an EIR.
26 Petitioner is informed and believes, based on information on OPR's CEQANet website, that
27 Respondent submitted both the Final EIR and the Notice of Determination to OPR on December
28 7, 2020. At no time prior to December 7, 2020 did Caltrans provide Petitioner with a written
10
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 proposed response to Petitioner's comments on the Draft EIR, thereby violating the
2 requirements of Public Resources Code section 21091(d)(2)(B) and CEQA Guidelines section
3 15088(b).

4 39. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion
5 by certifying an EIR that does not comply with CEQA. Accordingly, Respondent's certification
6 of the EIR and approval of the project must be set aside.

7 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

8 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:
1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondent to vacate
10 and set aside its approval of the Project, its issuance of the NOD, and its certification of the EIR
11 for the Project;

12 2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondent to comply
13 with the requirements of CEQA, and to take any other action as required by Public Resources
14| Code section 21168.9;

15 3. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent
16 injunctions restraining Respondent and its agents, employees, officers and representatives from
17 taking any action to implement the Project, pending full compliance with the requirements of
18 CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and State law;

19 4. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent
20 injunctions restraining Real Parties in Interest and their agents, employees, officers and
21 representatives from taking any action to implement the Project, pending full compliance with
22 the requirements of CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and State law;
23 5. For costs of suit;

25 other provisions of law; and

Our environmental coordinator for the Highway 70 Binney Junction project wanted to know if the city could post something on the Marysville website that Caltrans has finalized the
Environmental Impact Report for the State Route 70 Binney Junction Roadway Rehabilitation
and Complete Streets Project in Marysville. The document can be accessed at
https://dot.ca.gov/caltrans-near-me/district-3/d3-programs/d3-environmental/d3-environmental- docs/d3-yuba-county

Please me know if the city can accommodate our request. Thank you.
