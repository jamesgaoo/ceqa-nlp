VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioners and Plaintiffs Carbon California Company, LLC and Carbon California
3 Operating Company, LLC (collectively, "Carbon") bring this action to remedy the failure of the

4 County of Ventura (the "County") to properly evaluate, under the California Environmental
5 Equality Act, or CEQA, the environmental impacts associated with amendments to the County's
6 Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance designed to further limit oil and gas production and operations in
the County. The County improperly determined that these amendments are categorically exempt
8 from the provisions of CEOA. Because the amendments will significant and adversely impact the

9 environment, they are not exempt. The County further improperly relied on, at the last minute and
10 without compliance with CEQA, a previously-certified environmental impact report for the
11 County's 2040 General Plan as an "independent basis under CEQA for the adoption of the proposed
12 zoning ordinance amendments."

13 2. Carbon also challenges the amendments to the County's Non-Coastal Zoning
14 Ordinance on non-CEQA grounds. Carbon requests declaratory relief that it has vested rights to
15 continue its existing operations to completion in all of its respective fields within the County
16 without further discretionary approvals from the County. Carbon also seeks declaratory relief
17 affirming that the County's amendments are preempted by State and federal law. Lastly, Carbon
18 seeks damages from the County as the amendments to the County's Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance
19 constitute and unconstitutionally taking of Carbon's property interests,

20 3. CEQA is set forth in the Public Resources Code, section 21000 et seq. Additionally,
21 the Governor's Office of Planning and Research and the California Natural Resources Agency
22 together prepare, develop, certify, and adopt the "CEQA Guidelines" (14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15000
23 et seq.) and amendments thereto. The CEQA Guidelines are regulations that clarify, interpret, and
24 implement CEQA.

25 THE PARTIES

26 4. Carbon California Company, LLC is a Delaware limited liability company that is
27 registered to do business in California. Carbon California Operating Company, LLC is a Delaware
28 limited liability company that is registered to do business in California. Carbon maintains an office

1 in Santa Paula, California.

2 5. Carbon owns or possesses the following rights or interests in real property located in

3 the unincorporated portion of Ventura County: fee interests; leaseholds, licenses, easements, rights-

4 of-way and similar interests; and hydrocarbon and mineral rights and interests. Carbon engages in

5 the development and production of oil and natural gas in the unincorporated portion of the County.

6 Carbon is the recipient of land use permits and approvals from the County, including discretionary

7 use permits for oil and gas development and production.

8 6. Carbon is beneficially interested in the matters and actions described and complained

9 of in this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate; Complaint for Declaratory Relief and Damages

10 ("Petition"). Carbon is directly and adversely affected by the actions of the County described in this

11 Petition. Carbon is directly and adversely affected by the environmental and other impacts of the

12 zoning ordinance amendments complained of herein as well as the County's failure to properly
13 analyze, mitigate, or avoid those impacts. Carbon will be detrimentally affected or aggrieved by the

14 actions of the County if the Court does not grant relief.
15 7. Respondent County of Ventura is a political subdivision of the State of California.
16 The County acts by and through its Board of Supervisors (*Board"), the elected legislative body for
17 the County. The County and its Board may collectively be referred to herein as "Respondents."
18 8. Does 1 through 100, inclusive, are, on the basis of information and belief, agents,
19 affiliates, and associates of the named Respondents. The identities of said DOES are currently
20 unknown, and when they become known, the Petition will be amended to add them.

21 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS
22 The County's Historical Practice of Requiring Use Permits for Oil and Gas Production

23 9. The County's first zoning ordinance, adopted in 1947, included provisions regarding
24 "special use permits" for oil and gas development and production. Such permits are discretionary in
25 nature and allow the County to impose conditions of approval on the permits. Since 1966, the
26 County has required discretionary "conditional use permits" for oil and gas development and

27 production. After obtaining a use permit, a permittee typically obtains from the County ministerial

28 "zoning clearances" for specific items authorized by the permit. These ministerial zoning clearances

3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 are not subject to the provisions of the CEQA.

2 10. Prior to 2019, the County consistently recognized the vested rights doctrine's
3 applicability to its oil and gas use permits, even permits approved before 1966 that the County

4 refers to now as "antiquated."

5 11. In 2013, the Board conducted a hearing regarding several items association with oil
6 and gas development and production, including hydraulic fracturing (fracking) and the so-called
7 "antiquated" County permits. In a December 17, 2013, Board letter prepared for that hearing,
8 County staff stated,

9 The County has only a limited ability to address antiquated oilfield

10 permits due to the vested rights doctrine and constitutional takings and due process principles. The County's options to modify
11 antiquated oilfield permits consist of imposing: 1) permit changes that are reasonably related to a permittee's request for modification of an
12 existing permit; 2) limited permit changes based on the establishment

13 by the County of harm, danger or nuisance caused by a permitted activity; 3) limited permit changes based on the establishment by the
14 County of a permittee's significant violations of law or permit conditions; and 4) specific permit changes contemplated by existing
15 conditions in the permit. In addition, a permit could be revoked if its operations constitute a nuisance a and imposition of conditions to
16 eliminate the nuisance is not feasible.

17 12. In 2014, the County's County Counsel's Office issued a memorandum titled "Legal
18 Analysis of Antiquated Oilfield Conditional Use Permits" (the "2014 Memorandum"). The 2014
19 Memorandum discussed how the "drilling of wells for oil and gas production has been continuously

20 subject to a permit from the County since" the County's first zoning ordinance. The 2014

21 Memorandum further noted that the County's "zoning ordinance has become more stringent in its
22 regulation of oil and gas development and production and the conditions imposed on use permits

23 have become more stringent." However, the 2014 Memorandum also concluded that the County's
24 ability to impose new conditions on older, or "antiquated" oilfield permits:

25 is very limited. Because of the vested rights doctrine and

26 constitutional protections afforded these permits, the County can impose new, narrowly tailored conditions on these permits only when
27 a compelling public necessity, such as danger, harm or public nuisance, or significant violations exist, and not through an ordinary
28 exercise of the police power for the general welfare.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

•

1 13. In 2015, the Board conducted a study session with other public agencies and the
2 | public regarding the California condor and possible effects from oil and gas operations in the

3 County. In connection with that study session, the County Planning Director issued a December 15,

4 2015, Board letter that stated in part:

5 Many oil and gas facilities, however, operate pursuant to existing

6 permits in which the permit holder possesses vested rights. The

7 County's authority to modify these permits is limited by the vested rights doctrine. Rights in a permit "vest" (i.e., become protected)

8 when the permit has been issued and the permit holder has invested substantial sums in the furtherance of the authorized uses. Once

9 permit rights vest, the permit a holder has a property right in the permit as approved that cannot be modified by the County - for instance, by
10 adding new condor-related permit conditions without satisfying

11 constitutional due process requirements. Hence, vested rights in existing permits cannot be unilaterally impaired by the County under

12 its general land use authority. Instead, vested rights can only be impaired if the impairment resulting from the new permit conditions

13 is reasonably necessary to address a menace to the public health and

14 safety or a public nuisance presented by the permitted use. Important factors to be considered in applying this standard are whether the

15 nature and extent of the impairment to the vested rights is proportionate to the nature, importance, and urgency of the interest to

16 be served by the new permit conditions, and whether the permit conditions are appropriately tailored and limited to the situation

17 necessitating the action.

18 In the event the County sought to unilaterally modify existing

19 conditional use permits to add condor-related conditions, the County would be required to meet the above-described standard for impairing

20 the permit holder's vested rights in the permit. The standards must be

21 met with respect to each specific permit the County sought to modify, and with respect to each specific condition sought to be added. Such

22 permit modifications would require the provision of notice and a public hearing to each affected permit holder.

23 The Board's 2019 Directives regarding Oil and Gas Use Permits

24 14.

25 At an April 9, 2019, public hearing, a County Supervisor agendized a request to the

26 Board to adopt an interim ordinance as an urgency measure to "temporarily prohibit the County's

27 approval of new oil and gas wells, and re-drilling of existing oil and gas wells, for oil production" in

28 a portion of the unincorporated area of the County near Oxnard. According to the Supervisor's
Board letter to his colleague, an oil operator proposed to drill new oil wells in the unincorporated

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 area of the County near Oxnard "pursuant to antiquated oil and gas permits." Also according to the

2 Supervisor's letter, the United States Geological Survey ("USGS") "found indications that
3 petroleum-related gases are migrating into the drinking water aquifers of the Fox Canyon aquifer

4 system in the vicinity of steam injection and wastewater disposal wells." The Supervisor's letter did

5 not inform the Board that the USGS stated that the detection of such gases could have resulted from

6 natural processes. In addition, the Supervisor's letter requested that the Board direct the County

7 Planning Division to "also study potential amendments to the County's zoning ordinances to require
8 discretionary approval of new development under antiquated oil and gas permits." The Board

9 approved the Supervisor's requested actions.

10 15. In September 2019, the County's County Counsel, not the Planning Division,
11 reported back to the Board regarding amendments to the County's zoning ordinances concerning the
12 so-called "antiquated permits." In a letter report dated September 10, 2019, County Counsel
13 "provide[d] an overview of the legal issues and legislative options regarding" such amendments.
14 That letter report discussed vested rights principles associated with "antiquated" oil and gas permits.
15 Reversing its long-held position regarding the vested rights associated with such permits, County
16 Counsel concluded, "The County, however, has a good legal position that holders of typical
17 antiquated permits generally do not have vested rights to engage in new oil and gas development
18 based solely on the original antiquated permits ...." In support of its newly-developed position,
19 County Counsel further stated that the "antiquated" use permits are "analogous to general zoning
20 designations - which do not give rise to vested rights."

21 16. The September 10, 2019, letter report from County Counsel attached as an exhibit a

22 1955 "special use permit" as a "representative antiquated permit." The County approved this 1955
23 permit after hearings by both the County Planning Commission and the Board. The 1955 permit
24 also contained substantial conditions, including limitations on the depth and location of drilling.
25 17. County Counsel also provided to the Board, as an exhibit to the September 10, 2019,

26 letter report, proposed draft amendments to the County's Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance regarding

27 oil and gas permitting. County Counsel sought direction from the Board regarding these draft
28 amendments.

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 18. On September 9, 2019, Carbon submitted to the County through legal counsel a

2 comment letter regarding the Board's consideration of potential amendments to the County's

3 regulation of existing use permits for oil and gas production.

4 19. At the September 10, 2019, hearing, the Board approved a motion to "[r]eceive and

5 file County Counsel report, and direct the Planning Division to prepare draft amendments to the

6 County's zoning ordinances that are consistent with the potential draft amendment attached to the

7 County Counsel report to be processed through the standard land use public hearing process."

8 Oil and Gas Production in the County's 2040 General Plan and EIR

9 20. In January 2020, the County released for public review a draft "program" (as

10 opposed to "project") environmental impact report ("EIR") for its 2040 General Plan. According to

11 that draft EIR, "Although the legally required contents of a program EIR are the same as those of a
12 project EIR, program EIRs typically cover broad programs or large projects, such as a general plan,
13 and contain a more general discussion of impacts, alternatives, and mitigation measures than a
14 project EIR." The draft EIR further stated,

15 As a program EIR, this document uses appropriately programmatic
16 thresholds of significance as compared to the project-level thresholds that might be used for an EIR. on a specific development project.
17 Because the 2040 General Plan EIR is broad and general, it may not be ripe for consideration of environmental impacts that may occur on
18 individual parcels or in connection with other projects that may be consistent with the 2040 General Plan. The process described above, 19 initiated with preparation of an initial study, provides a road map for

20 consideration of subsequent projects and the associated CEQA
documentation.

21 In September 2020, the Board approved the 2040 General Plan and certified the final EIR for it (the

22 "General Plan EIR").

23 21. The 2040 General Plan includes new policies limiting oil and gas production in the
24 County, and the General Plan EIR purported to analyze the environmental impacts of such polices.

25 The General Plan EIR concluded that the policies would significantly and adversely impact mineral

26 resources within the County, which are which are themselves part of the "environment" to be

27 protected under CEQA. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21060.5.) The County failed to mitigate or avoid

28 those impacts, as the Board deleted the only proposed mitigation measures that purported to address

7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

-

2 the 2040 General Plan's significant impacts on mineral resources. The General Plan EIR also failed

3 to analyze the foreseeable, indirect, and significant impacts arising from the 2040 General Plan's

4 limitations on oil and gas production, including impacts regarding greenhouse gas emissions.

22.

5 The General Plan EIR did not address cumulative impacts arising from the 2040

6 General Plan and the Zoning Amendments even though the draft General Plan EIR stated, "The
County is considering amending its zoning ordinances to similarly require a discretionary permit
modification to authorize new oil and gas development under 'antiquated' use permits that lack

9 expiration dates, well limits, and other development parameters (i.e., approximately pre-1966)."

10 The 2020 Zoning Ordinance Amendments regarding Oil and Gas Use Permits

23. In response to the Board's 2019 directive, County staff prepared proposed
11 amendments to Article 7, Section 8107-5 of the Ventura County Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance

12

13 regarding the County's permitting requirements for oil and gas development and production

14 (including as subsequently modified and approved by the Board, the "Zoning Amendments"). These
Amendments require a discretionary approval from the County for all "new" oil and gas
15 development and production operations, including the drilling of any new well, the re-drilling or
16

17 deepening of any existing well. The Zoning Amendments preclude the use of a ministerial zoning
clearance for new oil and gas operations.

18 24.

19 The Zoning Amendments also apply the County's existing Oil Development

20 Guidelines, located in section 8107-5.5 of the County's Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance, to all new,

21 adjusted, or modified discretionary permits authorizing oil and gas development and production

22 operations. The Zoning Amendments also apply the County's existing Oil Development Standards,

23 located in section 8107-5.6 of the County's Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance, to all existing oil and

24 gas development and production operations. Among other items, these Guidelines and Standards

25 impose restrictions on oil and gas development and production, including setback requirements, a

26 prohibition on the flaring of gas, and a prohibition on the trucking of produced materials. According

27 to County staff, the 2020 Zoning Amendments "would slow and/or reduce the potential expansion
of certain new local oil and gas development."

28 25. The County Planning Commission considered the proposed Zoning Amendments at

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE: COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

-

2 a July 30, 2020, public hearing. On July 29, 2020, Carbon submitted a comment letter regarding the

3 proposed amendments to the Planning Commission through legal counsel. Carbon also spoke at the

4 July 30, 2020, hearing. The Planning Commission recommended approval of the Zoning
Amendments with minor revisions.

5 26.

6 The Board considered the proposed Zoning Amendments at a November 10, 2020,

7 public hearing. County staff prepared a Board letter for the November 10, 2020, hearing regarding

8 the Zoning Amendments. That initial Board letter, made available to the public prior to the hearing,

9 recommended that the Board find the Zoning Amendments categorically exempt from CEQA
pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15308.

10 27.

11 On November 9, 2020, Carbon submitted a comment letter to the Planning

12 Commission through legal counsel. Carbon's comment letter discussed why the Zoning

13 Amendments are not exempt from the provisions of CEQA, including because the amendments will

14 have significant and adverse impacts regarding mineral resources and greenhouse gas emissions.

15 Carbon also commented that the proposed zoning amendments will have cumulative impacts on
mineral resources when considered with policies in the 2040 General Plan.

16 28.

17 On November 10, 2020, County staff distributed to the Board a "revised" Board

18 letter for the proposed zoning amendments. That revised Board letter included, for the first time, a
new recommendation to the Board that it also find that:

19

20 to the extent commenters have raised issues about the application of new 2040 General Plan policies to new oil and gas wells, that those

21 impacts factually are the same as the impacts evaluated in the certified environmental impact report (EIR) for the 2040 General Plan, that

22 there is no new or substantially more severe impact requiring a further EIR under CEQA Guidelines section 15162, and that it is appropriate

23 to rely on that certified EIR for the extension of those policies to new

24 oil and gas wells, and reliance on that EIR is an independent basis under CEQA for the adoption of the proposed zoning ordinance amendments.

25 29.

26 Carbon is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the County did not

27 distribute or make available to the public the Revised Board Letter to the public before November

28 10, 2020. Carbon is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the County did not
distribute or make available to the public the Revised Board Letter to the public during the

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

- November 10, 2020, Board hearing regarding the Zoning Amendments.

2 30.

3 On November 10, 2020, the Board voted 3-2 to approve the Zoning Amendments.
The Board also found, with regard to CEQA and the Zoning Amendments:

4 a. "that the adoption of the proposed ordinance amending the

5 Ventura County Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance (Exhibit 32) is

6 categorically exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15308 as actions by a regulatory agency to assure the maintenance and protection of the
environment because the project would implement a regulatory

8 process involving procedures for protection of the environment";

9 b. "that no substantial evidence exists precluding the use of this
categorical exemption based on

10 the presence of unusual circumstances or any other exception set forth in CEQA Guidelines
section 15300.2"; and
11
C
12 "to the extent commenters have raised issues about the

13 application of new 2040 General Plan policies to new oil and gas wells, that those impacts factually are the same as the impacts

14 evaluated in the certified environmental impact report (EIR) for the 2040 General Plan, that there is no new or substantially more severe

15 impact requiring a further EIR under CFQA Guidelines section 15162, and that it is appropriate to rely on that certified EIR for the

16 extension of those policies to new oil and gas wells, and reliance on

17 that EIR is an independent basis under CEQA for the adoption of the proposed zoning ordinance amendments,"

18 31. Carbon is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the County purported
19 to file an effective Notice of Exemption with the County Clerk on November 13, 2020.

20 The Effect of the Zoning Amendments on Carbon's Vested Rights

21 32.

22 Carbon acquired its property interests in the County from its predecessors at various

23 times since 2016. Carbon conducts its operations pursuant to discretionary use permits that were

24 originally approved by the County as far back as 1948 and as recently as 1981. Certain of these

25 permits, but not all, have subsequently been modified. Pursuant to these use permits, Carbon

26 produces oil and gas resources from multiple fields within the County. Under these permits, Carbon

27 or its predecessors have regularly drilled new wells or deepened existing wells pursuant to zoning

28 clearances and without further discretionary approvals, including new or modified use permits, from
the County.

10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 33. Carbon and its predecessors have invested substantial sums in acquiring its interests

2 in the County and in maintaining and developing the infrastructure required to continue and

3 complete operations in these fields subject to the applicable use permits. Carbon continues to

4 operate in each of its fields and has objectively demonstrated an intent to complete operations in

5 each of its fields. Carbon has substantial reserves in each field that remain to be developed and

6 extracted. Carbon has vested rights to continue to extract oil and gas resources in each of its

7 permitted fields until completion.

8 34. The County has not established, or even sought to establish, that Carbon's operations
9 constitute a nuisance or a danger. The County has not established, or even sought to establish, that

10 Carbon has significantly violated the terms of any of its permits. The County has not offered any

11 compensation to Carbon.

12 35. The Zoning Amendments will limit Carbon's vested rights. The Zoning

13 Amendments impose new regulations and limitations on oil and gas development and production in

14 the County, in particular by imposing regulations establishing various setback requirements for
15 existing and new wells and by precluding the flaring of gas or the trucking of produced oil or water

16 in connection with existing and new operations. Carbon's operations involve and will continue to

17 involve the flaring of gas and the trucking of produced fluids. Additionally, Carbon operates in the

18 Zoning Amendments' setback areas and has additional reserves in those setback areas. The Zoning
19 Amendments will require Carbon to cease all operations in certain of its fields. The Zoning
20 Amendments will preclude Carbon from completing operations in many fields. The Zoning

21 Amendments will substantially interfere with Carbon's investment-backed expectations.

22 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

23 36. Carbon has exhausted all available administrative remedies before Respondents or is

24 otherwise excused from doing so.

25 37. Carbon has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law, and thus seeks a writ of

26 mandate from this Court. In the absence of such remedy, the County's violations of State law will

27 remain in effect.

28 38. This Court has jurisdiction to issue the requested writ of mandate pursuant to Public

11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

- Resources Code sections 21168.5 (or, alternatively, 21168) and 21168.9 as well as Code of Civil

2 Procedure section 1085 (or, alternatively, 1094.5). This Court has jurisdiction over Carbon's
3 | requested declaratory relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1060.

4 39. Venue in this Court is appropriate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 393

5 and 394.

6 40. This Petition is timely filed, including pursuant to Public Resources Code section

7 21167, subdivision (d).

8 41. In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5, Carbon timely served on

9 Respondents by email and a certified mail a written notice of Carbon's intention to commence this

10 action, a true and correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

11 42. Carbon separately and concurrently notifies Respondents that Carbon elects to

12 prepare the record of proceedings in this matter pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6,

13 subdivision (b)(2). Such notification is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

14 43. In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil

15 Procedure section 388, Carbon will serve a copy of this Petition on the California Attorney General.

16 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

17 (Violations of CEQA, Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)

18 44. Carbon realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as if fully
19  set forth herein.

20 45. Broadly speaking, CEQA directs certain local agencies such as the County to

21 identify and analyze the potentially significant environmental impacts of certain actions, or

22 "projects," so as to inform agency decision-makers and the public of the environmental

23 consequences of a project. An agency undertaking the initial CEQA review of a project, referred to

24 as the "lead" agency, will usually engage in a three-step process. First, the lead agency determines if
25 the action being considered is a "project" subject to CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15060.) Second,
26 the lead agency determines if the project is exempt from CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15061.)

27 Third, the lead agency determines whether the project could result in potentially significant
28 environmental impacts. Depending on whether or not there are significant impacts and whether

12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 those impacts can be mitigated to a level below significance, a lead agency will prepare a negative
2 declaration, a mitigated negative declaration, or a full EIR for a project. (CEQA Guidelines,

3 § 15063, subd. (b).)

4 46. The County determined that the Zoning Amendments are categorically exempt from
5 CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15308, which exempts qualifying actions "to assure

6 the maintenance, restoration, enhancement, or protection of the environment." CEQA Guidelines
7 section 15308 does not apply to projects that will have a significant adverse environmental impact.
8 The Zoning Amendments will have a significant adverse environmental impacts, including on
9 mineral resources and regarding greenhouse gas emissions as well as cumulative impacts with the
10 2040 General Plan. Respondents improperly determined that the Zoning Amendments are exempt
11 from the provisions of CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15308.

12 47. Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2, subdivision (c), "A categorical
13 exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity
14 will a have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." CEQA Guidelines
15 section 15300.2, subdivision (c) negates a categorical exemption where a project has an unusual
16 circumstance and where there is 'a reasonable possibility of a significant effect due to that unusual
17 circumstance." There is a reasonable possibility that the Zoning Amendments will have a significant
18 effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.

19 48. CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2, subdivision (c) also negates a categorical
20 exemption when there is "evidence that the project will have a significant environmental effect."
21 Evidence that a project will have a significant environmental impact necessarily establishes a

22 reasonable possibility that the project will have a significant effect on the environment due to
23 unusual circumstances. The Zoning Amendments will have a significant adverse environmental
24 impacts, including on mineral resources (including by prohibiting or impeding mineral resource
25 extraction) and regarding greenhouse gas emissions (including those generated by required oil
26 imports). Respondents' determination that the "exception to the Categorical Exemption [found in
27 CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2, subdivision (c)] is not applicable to the proposed project" is not
28 supported by substantial evidence.

13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 49. The County's improper determination that the Zoning Amendments are exempt from
2 the provisions of CEQA constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

3 50. Concurrently with its approval of the Zoning Amendments, the Board found that the
4 programmatic 2040 General Plan EIR "is an independent basis under CEQA for the adoption of the

5 proposed zoning ordinance amendments." Under CEQA, an agency may rely on a previously-

6 certified programmatic EIR to dispense with further CEQA review of an activity within the program
7 and if the activity's impacts were adequately analyzed by the programmatic EIR. (CEQA
Guidelines, § 15168, subd. (c).) On the other hand, an agency must prepare an "additional

9 environmental document" "[i]f a later activity would have effects that were not examined in the
10 program EIR." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15168, subd. (c).)
11 51. When an agency "proposes to carry out of approve an activity within the program
12 and to rely on the program EIR for CEQA compliance," an agency subject to public notice
13 requirements must notify the public that the proposed "activity is within the scope of the program
14 approved earlier" and that the "program EIR adequately describes the activity for the purposes of
15 CEQA." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15168, subd. (e).) The County was required to, but did not, comply
16 with the noticing requirements of CEQA Guidelines section 15168.
17 52. The County's finding that the programmatic 2040 General Plan EIR "is an
18 independent basis under CEQA for the adoption of the proposed zoning ordinance amendments" is
19 I not supported by substantial evidence. The Zoning Amendments are not within the scope of the
20 2040 General Plan or its EIR. County staff's November 10, 2020, Board letter states, "The proposed
21 zoning amendments would make these new [2040 General Plan] policies applicable to a broader
22 range of proposed oil and gas development based on the new discretionary approval requirement for
23 projects which, under the status quo, only require[] a ministerial approval." The 2040 General Plan
24 EIR acknowledged that the 2040 General Plan's new policies regarding oil and gas production will
25 have significant, adverse impacts on the environment, including with regard to mineral resources
26 and related to greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, the significant environmental impacts
27 associated with those 2040 General Plan policies will be broadened by the Zoning Amendments.
28 The Zoning Amendments will result in significant environmental effects that were not examined in

14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 the 2040 General Plan EIR and require a subsequent EIR under CEQA Guidelines section 15162.
2 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15168, subd. (c).)

3 53. CEQA prohibits the "piecemealing" of large project into smaller ones in order to
4 minimize a project's impacts or avoid the full disclosure and analysis of a projects' environmental

5 impacts. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15378, subd. (a), 15063, subd. (a)(1).) The Board directed County

6 staff in September 2019 to prepare the Zoning Amendments to be consistent with already-drafted

7 provisions put forth to the Board in September 2019. The County circulated the draft 2040 General

8 Plan EIR for public review in January 2020. The draft General Plan EIR specifically noted that the

9 County was "considering amending its zoning ordinances to similarly require a discretionary permit
10  modification to authorize new oil and gas development under 'antiquated' use permits ....' Despite
11 the reasonably foreseeable Zoning Amendments, the County illegally piecemealed them from the
12 2040 General Plan and failed to adequately analyze the cumulative impacts of them, especially with
13 regard to mineral resources and greenhouse gas emissions.
14 54. CEQA provides requirements for an adequate and effective Notice of Exemption.
15 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15062.) Carbon is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the
16 County Clerk did not, with regard to the Notice of Exemption for the Zoning Amendments, comply
17 with the provisions of CEQA Guidelines section 15062, including by failing to make the Notice of
18 Exemption available for public inspection. Carbon is informed and believes, and on that basis
19 alleges, that the County did not comply with the alternative notice requirements of the Governor's
20 Executive Order N-54-20 or Executive Order N-80-20.

21 55. As a result of the foregoing CEQA violations, Respondents prejudicially abused their

22 discretion by exempting the Zoning Amendments from CEQA, by relying on the 2040 General Plan
23 EIR, by piecemealing the Zoning Amendments, and by failing to provide proper notice of its
24 actions.

25 56. Respondents have violated CEQA by failing to proceed in a manner required by law
26 and by failing to support their determinations or decisions with substantial evidence. (Pub.

27 Resources Code, § 21168.5.) Alternatively, Respondents have violated CEQA by proceeding in
28 excess of their jurisdiction and by prejudicially abusing their discretion by failing to proceed in the

15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

1 manner required by law, by failing to support their decisions with findings, and by failing to support
2 their findings with substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168; Code Civ. Proc.,
3 cOa 1094.5.)

4 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (Declaratory Relief regarding Vested Rights; C.C.P., § 1060 et seq.)

6 57. Carbon realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as if fully

7 set forth herein.

8 58. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Carbon and Respondents

9 concerning Carbon's vested rights arising from discretionary use permits obtained from the County
10 authorizing Carbon's oil and gas development and production on and below properties located in
11 the County. Carbon contend that all of its discretionary use permits give rise to vested rights to
12 continue oil and gas development and production in permitted fields until completion, whereas
13 Respondents dispute these contentions and contend that certain permits held by Carbon do not give
14 rise to any vested right to continue operating until completion without further discretionary
15 approvals from the County.

16 59. Carbon desires a judicial determination of the rights associated with its use permits
17 and requests a judicial declaration and determination that:

18 a. Carbon has vested rights to continue its existing operations to completion in all of its
19 respective fields within the County without further discretionary approvals from the
20 County;

21 b. the County may not require Carbon to obtain further discretionary use permits from
22 the County in order to continue its operations to completion in all of its respective
23 fields within the County; and

24 C. the County may not apply the Zoning Amendments to Carbon's existing use permits.
25 60. A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time under the
26 circumstances in order that Carbon may ascertain its rights and duties with respect to its permits and
27 property interests in order to plan its business activities with certainty.

I THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Declaratory Relief regarding Preemption)

3 61. Carbon realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as if fully
4 set forth herein.

5 62. Federal and State law comprehensively and exclusively regulate certain areas related

6 to oil and gas production, including the drilling, operation, and maintenance of wells. Federal and

7 State authority in these areas preempts local legislation and regulation of the same. The County

8 does not have authority to legislate or regulate in these areas except as specifically provided for by
9 federal or State law.

10 63. The Zoning Amendments constitute an impermissible intrusion into areas occupied
11 by federal and State law. The Zoning Amendments are preempted by federal and State law and are

12 invalid in whole or, alternatively, in part.

13 64. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Carbon and Respondents
14 concerning whether the Zoning Amendments are preempted by federal and State law. Carbon
15 desires a judicial declaration and determination that the Zoning Amendments are preempted by
16 federal and State law in whole or part.

17 65, A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time under the
18 circumstances in order that Carbon may ascertain its rights and duties with respect to its permits and
19 property interests in order to plan its business activities with certainty.
20 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (Damages for Inverse Condemnation or Unconstitutional Taking; Cal. Const., art. 1, § 19;
22 U.S. Const., 5th Amend.)
23 66. Carbon realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as if fully
24 set forth herein.

25 67. If allowed to impair Petitioner's vested rights, the Zoning Amendments effectuate a
26 taking of Carbon's property. The Zoning Amendments will deprive Carbon of all, or substantially
27 all, of the economically beneficial use of certain property for the purported benefit of the public.
28 68. The Zoning Amendments also effectuate a taking of Carbon's property based on the

17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE: COMPLAINT FOR DECL. RELIEF AND DAMAGES

economic impact of the Zoning Amendments on Carbon, the extent of the Zoning Amendment's
2 interference with Carbon's investment-backed expectations (which were based on the vesting rights

3 associated with Carbon's use permits), and the character of the Zoning Amendments.

4 69. The Zoning Amendments violate article 1, section 19 of the California Constitution

5 and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and, more specifically, its Takings

6 Clause.

7 70. Carbon has not received any, let alone just, compensation from the County or
8 otherwise to remedy the taking of Carbon's property rights.

9 71. Carbon has been and will be damaged from the taking of its property rights and will
10 suffer damages in an amount to be determined at trial.

11 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

12 In each of the respects enumerated above, Respondents have violated their duties under the

13 law, abused their discretion, failed to proceed in a manner required by law, and made
14 determinations that are not supported by substantial evidence.
15 WHEREFORE, Carbon prays for relief as follows:

16 1. for a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to vacate and set aside the
17 Zoning Amendments;

18 2. for a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to void, vacate, and set aside
19 Respondents' determination that the Zoning Amendments are exempt from CEQA;

20 3. for a peremptory writ directing respondents to void, vacate, and set aside

21 Respondents' determination that the 2040 General Plan EIR provides any basis for the required

22 CEQA review of the Zoning Amendments;

23 4. for a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary or permanent
24 injunctive relief or other order, including under Code of Civil Procedure section 526, enjoining
25 Respondents from taking any action in furtherance of, or to implement, the Zoning Amendments
26 during the pendency of this action;

27 5. for determinations and declarations that:

28 a. Carbon has vested rights to continue its existing operations to completion in all of its

1 respective fields within the County without further discretionary approvals from the

2 County;

3 b. the County may not require Carbon to obtain further discretionary use permits from

6 c. the County may not apply the Zoning Amendments to Carbon's existing use permits;

7 and

8 d. the Zoning Amendments are preempted by federal and State law in whole or part.

9 6. for just compensation for the taking of property in an amount to be determined at
10 trial;

11 7. for damages in an amount to be determined at trial;

12 8. for costs of the suit;

13 9 for reasonable attorney fees, including pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections
