PARTIES

2 1. Plaintiff THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE UNITED FOOD &

3 COMMERCIAL WORKERS, LOCAL 135, is, and at all times relevant herein was, upon
information and belief an unincorporated non-profit association with its principal place of business

5 in the County of San Diego, California (the "Board").

2. Plaintiff UNITED FOOD & COMMERCIAL WORKERS UNION LOCAL 135
7 (together with the "Board", collectively "Plaintiff* or "UFCW") is, and at all times relevant herein
was, upon information and belief an unincorporated non-profit association with its principal place of

9 business in the County of San Diego, California.

10 3. Petitioner has a clear, present and beneficial right to the performance of Respondent's

11 duty to carry out its obligations in conformity with all applicable state, federal and other laws.

12 4. Respondent and Defendant CITY OF SAN DIEGO (the "City" or "Respondent") is a
13 local government agency and political subdivision. The City has taken the actions, as fully alleged
14 below by which Petitioners are aggrieved and of which Petitioners seeks review by this Court.

15 5. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, Defendant and Real
16 Party-in-Interest SCOTTISH RITE CATHEDRAL OF SAN DIEGO (the "Scottish Rite") was and
17 is at all times relevant herein, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of
18 California with its principal business within the County of San Diego.

19 6. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, Defendant and Real
20 Party-in-Interest THE HOME DEPOT (the "Home Depot") was and is at all times relevant herein, a
21 multistate corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware and registered
22 with the Secretary of State of the State of California to conduct retail operations throughout
23 California, including within the County of San Diego.

24 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

25 7. The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to sections 1085 and 1094.5 of
26 the California Code of Civil Procedure and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources

27 Code.

28 8. Petitioner has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law and has exhausted all
2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
129199-00000001/5144565.2 CASE NO.

1 available administrative remedies.

2 9. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California,

3 County of San Diego, because the subject property and development project are located in the County

4 of San Diego.

5 10. Petitioner complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by mailing written
6 notice of the commencement of this action to Respondent prior to filing suit. Petitioner also sent
7 Respondent a notice of intent to sue. Copies of both notices are attached as Exhibit A hereto.

8 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

11. Petitioner petitions this Court for a Writ of Mandate ("Petition") directed to
10 Respondent.

11 12. Petitioner challenges Respondent's approval of Addendum No. 657591 to Program
12 Environmental Impact Report No. 518009 (SCH No. 2017071066) and Mitigation, Monitoring and
13 Reporting Program in connection with its Project No. 657591, the Mission Valley Home
14 Depot/Scottish Rite Redevelopment project (the "Project").

15 13. The Proposed Project involves the demolition of an existing auto-center and masonic
16 assembly building and construction of a new 40,000 square foot masonic assembly building and a
17 new 106,688 square foot Home Depot Store with a 17,913 square foot garden center and parking
18 structure on an 18.33-acre site located at 1895 Camino Del Rio South in the Mission Valley
19 community.
20 A. The Proposed Project is Subject to CEOA.

21 14. CEQA is California's most important environmental law governing the review and
22 approval process of most developments in California. The purpose of CEQA is to inform
23 governmental decision-makers and the public about the environmental effects of proposed activities,
24 identify ways that damage to the environment can be avoided or significantly avoided, prevent

25 significant, avoidable damage to the environment by requiring changes in projects through the use
26 of alternatives or mitigation measures and disclose to the public the reasons why a governmental
27| agency approved the project in the manner chosen if significant environmental effects are involved.

28 (14 CCR § 15002.)
3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
129199-00000001/5144565.2 CASE NO.

1 15. CEQA expressly requires an evaluation of impacts of an activity which may cause
2 either a direct physical change in the environment, a or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical

3 change in the environment and disclosure of the same to the public and decision-makers. (See Cal.

4 Pub. Res. Code cor 21065 and 14 CCR § 15002).

5 B. The Project and Addendum 657591 Violate CEQA's Fundamental Tenants of Public

6 Disclosure and Informed Decision-Making

7 16. CEQA Guideline Section 15002 provides that the basic purposes of CEQA are to

8 (1) inform governmental decision makers and the public about the potential, significant

9 environmental effects of proposed activities, (2) Identify ways that environmental damage can be
10 avoided or significantly reduced, (3) Prevent significant, avoidable damage to the environment by

11 requiring changes in projects through the use of alternatives or mitigation measures when the
12 governmental agency finds the changes to be feasible, (4) Disclose to the public the reasons why a
13 governmental agency approved the project in the manner the agency chose if significant
14 environmental effects are involved. (14 CCR § 15002(a).)

15 17. Additionally, CEQA Guideline Section 15003 provides that "in addition to the

16 policies declared by the Legislature concerning environmental protection and administration of
17 CEQA in Sections 21000, 21001, 21002, and 21002.1 of the Public Resources Code, the courts of
18 this state have declared the following policies to be implicit in CEQA: ... (f) CEQA was intended
19 to be interpreted in such a manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment
20 within the reasonable scope of the statutory language. (Friends of Mammoth v. Board of
8 21 Supervisors, 8 Cal. 3d 247)" (14 CCR § 15003(f) (emphasis added).) §

22 18. Additionally, California Public Resources Code Section 21005 provides that "[t]he
23 Legislature finds and declares that it is the policy of the state that noncompliance with the
24 information disclosure provisions of [CEQA] which precludes relevant information from being
25| presented to the public agency, or noncompliance with substantive requirements of [CEQA], may
26 constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion," and that "any court which finds . . that a public agency
27 has taken an action without compliance with [CEQA], shall specifically address each of the alleged
28 grounds for noncompliance." (Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 21005(a) and (c) (emphasis added).)

VERIFIED PET/TION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
129199-00000001/5144565.2 CASE NO.

1 19. The Mission Valley Planning Group ("MVPG"), the recognized citizen-led
2 community group for the Mission Valley Community which provides official recommendations to
the Planning Commission and City Council on community goals and land development proposals
pertaining to Mission Valley, was asked to make an official recommendation to advise the Planning
Commission about the Project on December 2, 2020. At that time, Respondent had announced that
6 the Project would be reviewed under a Section 15164-addendum, but Addendum 657591 had not yet
been prepared, nor were its contents made available to either the MVPG or the general public for
comment or discussion.

20. Members of the MVPG and members of the public in attendance at the December 2,

10 2020 meeting raised concerns about the project and its lack of review given Respondent's decision

11 to use to an addendum, and MVPG voted to approve the Project "provided that the addendum does

12 not result in any new, previously unidentified impacts."

13 21. The above-facts clearly demonstrate that the MVPG trusted Respondent's discretion
14| in choosing to use an addendum, despite concerns that the addendum document would preclude
15 meaningful review and disclosure of the Project's potentially significant and previously unidentified
16 impacts. Respondent's subsequent failure to adequately disclose, discuss, and act on the new,
17 previously-identified impacts of the Project identified in the subsequently-published Addendum
18 657591 betrayed the MVPG's trust and belied the MVPG's conditional recommendation of approval

19 of the Project.

201 22. In addition, the Planning Commission was asked to make its recommendation on the

21 Project shortly on February 25, 2021, shortly after Addendum 657591 was published on or around

22 February 5, 2021.

23 23. The Planning Commission relied on the MVPG's favorable recommendation of the
24 Project and likewise trusted that Respondent had exercised discretion its appropriately in (a)
25 choosing a Section 15164-addendum as the appropriate environmental determination for the Project
26 and (b) informing the MVPG of the same prior to the MVPG's making its recommendation, and
27 accordingly Respondent betrayed the Planning Commission's trust.

28 24. Finally, the City Council, as Respondent's ultimate decision-making body pursuant
5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
129199-00000001/5144565.2 CASE NO.

1 to CEQA Guideline Section 15050, was asked to approve the Project with the Section 15164-

2 addendum on May 25, 2021, without the public ever having a meaningful opportunity to understand

3 or discuss the true scope of the Project's potentially significant environmental impacts.

4 25. The City Council relied on the MVPG's and Planning Commission's favorable

5 recommendation of the Project and trusted that Respondent had exercised its discretion appropriately

6 in (a) choosing a Section 15164-addendum as the CEQA Compliance Document for the Project and

7 (b) informing the MVPG and Planning Commission of the same prior to making their respective

8 recommendations.

9 26. The City Council, on behalf of Respondent, approved the Project and Addendum

10 657591 in violation of CEQA's fundamental tenets: public disclosure and informed decision-making.

11 C. The Addendum Prepared For The Project Fails To Comply With The Criteria Set Forth

12 By Section 15164.

13 27. Assuming, arguendo, that an addendum was permissible under CEQA for the Project,

14 it failed to comply with required criteria applicable to the preparation of addenda under CEQA. The
15 plain language of Section 15164(a) requires, as a threshold matter, that a Section 15162-analysis be
16 conducted to determine whether a subsequent EIR or negative declaration ought to be prepared, and
17 Section 15162 requires that any decision based on its provisions not to prepare a subsequent EIR or
18 negative declaration be supported by substantial evidence. (14 CCR 15164(a); 14 CCR 15162(a).)

19 28. In addition, the plain language of Section 15164(e) requires that any decision based
20 on 15164 to prepare an addendum--rather than a subsequent EIR or negative declaration--be
21 substantiated and recorded by a "brief explanation of the decision not to prepare a subsequent EIR

22 pursuant to Section 15162" which explanation "must be supported by substantial evidence." (14 CCR
23 15164(e).)

24 29. Respondent failed to comply with the above instructions by failing to conduct a proper
25 Section 15162 analysis as directed by Section 15164(a). This allegation is based on the absence from
26 the record of any evidence or documentation of a properly-documented Section 15162 analysis.

27 30. In addition, Respondent failed to comply with the instructions set forth in Section
28 15164(e) by failing to include anywhere in the record an explanation supported by substantial
6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
129199-00000001/5144565.2 CASE NO.

evidence of its decision not to prepare a subsequent EIR, as directed by Section 15164(e). This

2 allegation is based on the absence from the Addendum or elsewhere in the record of such explanation.

3 D. The Project And The Mission Valley Community Plan Update Project Constitute Two

4 Different Projects Under CEQA.

5 31. California Public Resources Code (PRC) Section 21065 defines a "project" under
CEQA to mean "an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or
a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment, and which is any of the

8 following: (a) An activity directly undertaken by any public agency, (b) An activity undertaken by

a person which is supported, in whole or in part, through contracts, grants, subsidies, loans, or other
10 forms of assistance from one or more public agencies, or (c) An activity that involves the issuance

11 to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for use by one or more public
12 agencies." (Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 21065.)

13 32. CEQA Guideline Section 15378 defines a "project" under CEQA to mean "the whole
14| of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment,
15 or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment, and that is .. [a]n activity
16 involving the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for use
17 by one or more public agencies." (14 CCR 15378(a)(3); see also Kaufman and Broad-South Bay,
18 Inc. v. Morgan Hill Unified School District, (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 464; Fullerton Joint Union High

19 School District v. State Board of Education, (1982) 32 Cal.3d 779; Simi Valley Recreation and Park
v. 20 District v. Local Agency Formation Commission of Ventura County (1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 648; and
21 Communities for a Better Environment v. California Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98.)

22 33. The Project a constitutes a project under CEQA.

23 34. The Mission Valley Community Plan Update is a project under CEQA, but

24 Respondent's discretion over that project concluded when Respondent adopted the Mission Valley

25 Community Plan Update along with a Final Programmatic EIR, subject to Statement of Overriding
26 Considerations, in 2019 (the "MVCPU PEIR").

27 35. In deciding to review the present Project through the preparation of a Section 15164-

28 addendum, Respondent erroneously considered whether there were substantial changes or new
7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
129199-00000001/5144565.2 CASE NO.

information which would require major revisions to MVCPU PEIR.

2 36. The issue is not and never was whether the MVCPU PEIR needs to be revised. Rather,

3 the issue is whether the Project, as an implementing project under the MVCPU PEIR, may have
4|| potentially significant effects on the environment.

37. By merely considering the former issue-whether the MVCPU PEIR needed to be
6 revised-Respondent completely failed to address the latter issue. As a result, Respondent
7 insufficiently analyzed whether the Project may have potentially significant effects on the

8 environment and, if so, to what extent.

9 E. There is no Substantial Evidence To Support Respondent's Decision Not To Prepare A

10 Subsequent EIR or Negative Declaration

11 38. Even though Addendum 657591 purports to be an addendum prepared in accordance

12 with Section 15164, the "analysis" reads like a Section 15168-Tiering Analysis, through which

13 Respondent fails to discuss the Project's potentially significant environmental impacts in and of
14 themselves. Instead, Respondent curtailed its discussion as relative to and for consistency with the
15 environmental impacts disclosed and studied by the MVCPU PEIR, and in doing so attempts to
16 argue-albeit poorly--the adequacy of the MVCPU PEIR to exempt the Project from conducting its
17| own, project-specific environmental impact analysis as required under CEQA. (Addendum 657591
18 at page 5 [*The analysis in this document evaluates the adequacy of the PEIR relative to the project.

19 The following analysis documents that the proposed project . .. would not cause new or more severe
20 significant impacts than those identified in the 2019 Mission Valley CPU PEIR nor otherwise trigger

21 the need for a subsequent or supplemental EIR"] (emphasis added).) This was a grave procedural

22 error.

23 39. The process for evaluating the of adequacy of programmatic EIRs relative to later
24 projects which implement those programs is governed by Section 15168 of the CEQA Guidelines.

25 (14 § CCR § 15168.)

26 40. Section 15168 defines a program EIR as "an EIR which may be prepared on a series

27 of actions that can be characterized as one large project and are related either (1) geographically,
28 (2) as logical parts in the chain of contemplated actions, (3) in connection with issuance of rules,
8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
l 129199-00000001/5144565.2 CASE NO.

regulations, plans, or other general criteria to govern the conduct of a continuing program, or (4) as
2 individual activities carried out under the same authorizing statutory or regulatory authority and
having generally similar environmental effects which can be mitigated in similar ways." (14 CCR

4 §15168(a).)

41. Section 15168 requires that, in order to avoid duplicative efforts, projects related to
programs and proposed after the adoption of programmatic EIRs be examined in light of those
programmatic EIRs to determine, on the one hand, "whether an additional environmental document
must be prepared" for the later activity, or, on the other hand, whether the previously-adopted
programmatic EIR identified all of the later-proposed project's potentially significant environmental
10 effects and sufficiently analyzed and mitigated them, such that no further review in an additional
11 environmental document would be necessary. (14 CCR §§ 15168(c)(1), (c)(2).)

12 42. There is a clear process, provided by Section 15168(c)(1) and (2), for determining
13 whether a later project related to a program requires additional environmental review in its own
14 CEQA compliance document OR can be approved as being within the scope of the program EIR
15 such that no new environmental document would be required. (Ibid.)

16 43. Respondent fails to follow the process outlined in Section 15168(c). In fact,
17 Respondent fails even to acknowledge, let alone cite to, Section 15168(c) at all, despite its purported
18 attempt to evaluate "the adequacy" of MVCPU programmatic EIR "relative to" the proposed Project,

19 which Respondent declares elsewhere is "part of the Mission Valley Community Plan Update
20 Program Environmental Impact Report (PEIR)." (Addendum 657591 at page 5; Ibid at page ["The

21 project site is a part of the Mission Valley Community Plan Update (CPU) Program Environmental
22 Impact Report (PEIR) (Project No. 518009/SCH No. 2017071066; Appendix A). The Mission Valley

23 CPU PEIR was approved on September 10, 2019 and analyzed an update to the Community Plan

24 that guides development of the entire Mission Valley Community"].)

25 44. In other words, it appears that in the course of preparing a Section 15164-addendum,
26 Respondent attempted to conduct a Section 15168-Tiering Analysis to tier its analysis of the Project

27 from the MVCPU PEIR, and neglected to follow the required procedures for such a Tiering Analysis

28 prescribed by Section 15168(c).
9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
I 129199-00000001/5144565.2 CASE NO.

1 45. As a result, the document Respondent ultimately prepared, Addendum 657591, is a
2 nonsense hybrid of rules, and in any case it grossly inadequate to constitute a proper CEQA
3 compliance document for the Project.

4 F. Respondent's Failure To Conduct A Proper Tiering Analysis Pursuant To CEQA

5 Guideline Section 15168(c) Was An Abuse of Discretion Which Violates CEQA.

6 46. California Public Resources Code Section 21083 provides that the Office of Planning

7 and Research shall prepare and develop proposed guidelines for the implementation of [CEQA], and
8 that the guidelines "shall include objectives and criteria for the orderly evaluation of projects and the
preparation of environmental impact reports and negative declarations in a manner consistent with
10 CEQA." (Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 21083(a).)

11 47. California Public Resources Code Section 21083 also provides that the "guidelines
12 shall specifically include criteria for public agencies to follow in determining whether or not a
13 proposed project may have a 'significant effect on the environment,"** and that "the criteria shall
14 require a finding that a project may have a "significant effect on the environment" if one or
15 more of the following conditions exist: (1) A proposed project has the potential to degrade the
16 quality of the environment, curtail the range of the environment, or to achieve short-term, to the
17 disadvantage of long-term, environmental goals, (2) The possible effects of a project are
18 individually limited but cumulatively considerable [where 'cumulatively considerable' means that
19 the incremental effects of an individual project are considerable when viewed in connection with
20| the effects of past projects, the effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable future

21 projects, and (3) The environmental effects of a project will cause substantial adverse effects on

22 human beings, either directly or indirectly." (Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 21083(b).)

23 48. Respondent is the lead agency, as defined by CEQA Guideline Section 15367, for the

24 all "projects," as defined by the Public Resources Code and the Guidelines, approved or carried out

25 in the City of San Diego. (14 CCR 15367; Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 21065; 14 CCR 15378.)

26 49. In violation of California Public Resources Code § 21083(a), Respondent failed to

27 follow the proper criteria prescribed by the CEQA Guidelines in determining whether or not the
28 Project may have a "significant effect on the environment."
10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
|l 129199-00000001/5144565.2 CASE NO.

50. Failure to comply with CEQA or the CEQA Guidelines constitutes a violation
2 actionable under CEQA. Judicial review under CEQA is generally limited to whether a lead agency

3 of its staff has abused its discretion by not proceeding as required by law or by making a

4 determination not supported by substantial evidence. (Cal. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5; Sierra

5 Club v. County of Sonoma (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1307, 1317.)

6 51. Respondent abused its discretion by failing to review the Project in accordance with
7 the proper CEQA Guideline and the processes and criteria set forth therein and by failing to support
8 its determination regarding the Project with substantial evidence. The proper CEQA Guideline for

9 tiering a subsequent-implementing project from a previously-adopted programmatic EIR is Section
10| 15168.

11 52. Respondent impermissibly attempted to tier the Project and exempt it from further
12 environmental review by claiming it to be "consistent with" the MVPCU PEIR using a Section

13 15164-addendum analysis, rather than •a Section 15168(c)(2) consistency analysis. Accordingly,

14 Respondent violated CEQA.
15 G. Respondent's Failure to Conduct an Initial Study Constituted an Abuse of Discretion

16 In Violation of CEQA.

17 53. If Respondent had looked to the proper authority--Section 15168to tier the

18 Project's analysis from the MVCPU PEIR, it would have known that Section 15168(c)(1) requires
19 preparation of an initial study. (See 14 CCR 15168(c) ["if a later activity would have effects that
20 were not examined in the program EIR, a new initial study would need to be prepared leading to

21 either an EIR or a negative declaration"].)

22 54. The record shows that Respondent failed to follow the mandates of Section
23 15168(c)(1).

24 55, In fact, there is no evidence in the record to suggest that Respondent ever consulted
25 Section 15168, despite the fact that Addendum 657591 clearly attempts to affect "tier" from a
26 programmatic level EIR pursuant to Section 15168(c). (Addendum 657691 at page 5 ["This
27 Addendum includes the following subsequent impact analysis that demonstrates that environmental
28 impacts associated with the project are consistent with the previously certified PEIR"].)
11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
| 129199-00000001/5144565,2 CASE NO.

56. Accordingly, Respondent violated CEQA by failing to follow the instructions set
2 forth in Section 15168 for tiering in its unsuccessful attempt to conduct a tier from a programmatic-

3 level EIR.

4 H. The Record Shows that The Project Will Have Significant Unmitigated Impacts To

5 Traffic, Which Were Not Fully Contemplated or Mitigated by the MVCU PEIR.

6 57. The Addendum itself discloses and identifies that the Project will have new,
7 previously-unmitigated project-specific impacts in the areas of Historical, Cultural, and Tribal

8 Cultural Resources, and Palcontological Resources such that new mitigation measures not previously
contemplated in the MVCPU PEIR would be required to mitigate the specific impacts of the Project.
10 (Addendum 657591 at page 6.)

11 58. Upon identifying the foregoing, Respondent's subsequent failure to conduct the
12 appropriate level of environmental review violated well-established requirements under CEQA.

13 59. The Addendum erroneously states that the Project's impacts to traffic are consistent
14 with the traffic impacts previously identified but left unmitigated by the MVCU PEIR. (Ibid at page

15 34.)

16 60. This statement is misleading and patently incorrect. First, the MVCPU PEIR is a
17 programmatic-level EIR prepared in accordance with Section 15168. As the MVCPU PEIR
18 explicitly states in the introductory section of its environmental analysis, "[p]rogrammatic impacts

19 are discussed in broad, qualitative terms. Individual projects implemented under the proposed
20 [Mission Valley Community Plan Update] would be assessed at the time they are proposed to

21 determine whether additional environmental review is warranted in accordance with CEQA."
22 (MVCPU PEIR at page 4-1).

23 61. The MVCU PEIR's traffic model did not evaluate traffic impacts of either regional
24 commercial or home improvement uses, the land uses to which this Project correspond. Rather, the
25 MVCPU PEIR's traffic model merely evaluated the traffic impacts of then-existing and then-

26 permissible hotel and office uses South of Interstate 8. In accordance with its programmatic nature,

27 as stated and cited above, the MVCPU PEIR presumed that subsequent projects implemented under
28 the later adopted Mission Valley Community Plan Update-which added permissible land use
12

designations South of Interstate 8, including regional commercial retail and home improvement

2 retail useswould run their own independent traffic models to study the traffic impacts resulting

3 from their proposed land uses. In other words, the MVCPU PEIR intended that a subsequent
4 implementing project proposing home improvement retail use South of Interstate 8, such as this

5 Project, be required to run its own independent traffic model analyzing the traffic impacts which

6 would result from adding that use to the area. An independent traffic model analyzing the traffic

7 impacts which would result from adding a home improvement retail land use to the area South of

8 Interstate 8 was not conducted, or alternatively, the results of such a model were not properly
9| discussed in the Addendum.

10 62. The Addendum merely discloses that the Project's Transportation Impact Analysis

11 (TIA) demonstrated that three intersections and three street segments would operate at failing (LOS

12 E or F) levels of service both with and without the addition of the Project, but then understates the

13 severity of this revelation by concluding that the above results e "consistent with the LOS analysis

14 in the [MVCPU PEIR]," so "[t]herefore, the impacts would remain significant and unmitigated,

15 consistent with the [MVCPU PEIR]. (Addendum 657591 at page 34 (emphasis added).)

16 63. These statements trivialize and understate the verified facts-that the Project is

17 surrounded by failing (i.e., highly congested) intersections and street segments, and that adding the

18 Project's anticipated traffic (including home improvement consumers' automobiles, contractor

19 trucks, and large delivery trucks) would (1). not only keep those intersections and street segments at
20 failing levels of service and (2) very likely exacerbate the degree of said failure, both of which

21 constitute potentially significant environmental impacts resulting from the Project. The Addendum

22 should have identified the foregoing as potentially significant environmental impacts, and upon

23 learning of the same, Respondent should have determined, per Section 15168(c)(1), that the Project

24 would have "effects that were not examined" in the MVCPU PEIR and, accordingly, that "a new

25 initial study would need to be prepared leading to either an EIR or a negative declaration." (CEQA
26 Guideline § 15168(c)(1).)

27

13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
129199-00000001/5144565.2 CASE NO.

64. Additionally, these statements of the Addendum reflect Respondent's
aforementioned procedural error in trying to conduct a Section 15168-Tiering Analysis within the
four corners of a self-proclaimed Section 15164-addendum document.

65. Upon information and belief, Respondent attempted to conduct a Section 15168-

5 Tiering Analysis within the four corners of a self-proclaimed Section 15164-addendum document

6 in order to preclude the Addendum from appropriate public review and comment, and therefore

abused its discretion.

66. Additionally, upon information and belief, Respondent's concealment of the
9 Project's potentially significant environmental impacts under the language of "consistency with the
10 MVCPU PEIR" caused its decision-makers to make an ill-informed decision to approve this

11 Project in stark violation of CEQA and deprived its decision-makers and the public from
12 meaningful understanding of the Project's potentially significant impacts to the environment.

13 67. Finally, CEQA Guideline Section 15063 provides that "[flollowing preliminary
14| review, the lead agency shall conduct an initial study determine if the project may have a
15 significant effect on the environment," and if the lead agency "determines that there is substantial
16 evidence that any aspect of the project . may cause a significant effect on the environment ...
17 the lead agency shall do one of the following: (A) Prepare an EIR, (B) Use a previously prepared
18 EIR which the lead agency determines would adequately analyze the project at hand, or (C)
19 Determine, pursuant to a program EIR, tiering, or another appropriate process, which of a
20 project's effects were adequately examined by an earlier EIR or negative declaration." (CEQA

21 Guideline § 15063(b)(1) and (2) (emphasis added).)

22 68. If Respondent had diligently considered the substantive error of the Project

23 applicant's TIA-either in the context of an appropriate Initial Study, or following a proper Section
24 15168(c)(1) determination that an Initial Study would need to be conducted for the Project-

25 Respondent would have discerned that there was substantial evidence that the Project may cause a

26 significant effect on traffic, and accordingly would have required the preparation of an EIR.

27 69. Because Respondent (a) failed to appreciate the significance of the TIA's failure to
28 analyze the Project's traffic impacts with the appropriate land use designation and (b) erroneously
14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
129199-00000001/5144565.2 CASE NO.

concluded that the results of the TIA--failing intersections and street segments-were consistent
2 with those of the MVCPU PEIR, and (c) impermissibly determined that the Project's unsupported
3 consistency with the MCVPU PEIR qualified it for an exemption from conducting further project-
specific environmental review under Section 15168(c)(2), Respondent severely abused its
5 discretion and violated CEQA.

6 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

7 (Violation of CEQA)

8 70. Respondent is charged with the authority to regulate and administer land use activities
9 within its jurisdiction, subject at all times to the obligations and limitations of all applicable state,
10 federal, and other laws, including CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and the California Planning and

11 Zoning Law.

12 71. Respondent failed to comply with its duty to conduct its environmental review of this

13 Project in accordance with the rules and procedures set forth in the California Public Resources Code

14 and the CEQA Guidelines and the fundamental principle of public disclosure and informed decision-
15 making underlying the Legislature's intent in enacting CEQA.

16 72. Respondent's preparation of a Section 15164-addendum violated CEQA.

17 73. Respondent's approval of the Project with an impermissibly- and improperly-
18 prepared Section 15164-addendum violated CEQA.

19 74. Specifically, the prepared Addendum fails to explain the Respondent's reasoning
20 behind its determination that a Section 15164-addendum was an appropriate CEQA compliance

21 document, as Section 15164 requires addendums to do. Furthermore, the Addendum fails to support

22 Respondent's reasoning with substantial evidence in the administrative record as Section 15164-

23 addendums are required to do under Section 15164 and Section 15162 which is cited in the former.
24 Finally, the Addendum substantively (1) fails to provide necessary public disclosure and adequate
25 project-specific information and analysis for decision-makers, (2) contains erroneous and misleading
26 descriptions of the Project's so-called consistency with the Mission Valley Community Plan PEIR,

27 and (3) fails state or substantially understates the scope of the Project's potentially significant impacts

28 to the Mission Valley Community planning area, the City of San Diego, and the environment at large.
15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
I 129199-00000001/5144565.2 CASE NO.

1 75. Moreover, the Addendum fails to state or substantially understates the severity and

2 scope of the Project's environmental impacts to Traffic and Land Use and Planning.

3 76. Therefore, the Addendum is at once the wrong CEQA compliance document through

4 which to review this Project and substantively inadequate to support Respondent's decision to
5 approve the Project.

6 77. As a result of (1) Respondent's abuse of discretion in the first place to use a Section

7 15164-addendum and (2) the actual Addendum's substantive inadequacies, the public and decision-
8 makers cannot fully appreciate the consequences of the Project's approval.

9 78. There is a fair argument based on substantial evidence that the Project may have a
10 significant effect on the environment and may have effects not examined or insufficiently examined

11 in the programmatic-level EIR previously prepared to update the Mission Valley Community Plan.
12 Accordingly, Respondent violated CEQA by failing to prepare an Initial Study of the Project in
13 accordance with Section 15168(c)(1), which Initial Study would have led to either an MND or EIR
14 and at least some opportunity for public comment, to which the public and decision-makers are
15 entitled but were denied in this instance by Respondent's ab initio abuse of discretion in choosing to
16 use a Section 15164-addendum for this Project.

17 79. To comply with state law and ensure the public and the decision-makers have

18 adequate information to consider the effects of the Project, Respondent MUST start its CEQA review
19 of the Project anew and reconduct the same in a manner which complies with the CEQA Guidelines,
20 particularly Section 15168 and 15162.

21 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

22 WHEREFORE, Petitioners and Plaintiffs pray for relief as follows:

23 1. Alternative and peremptory writs of mandate commanding Respondent to vacate its

24 determination and approval the Addendum;

25 2. An injunction prohibiting Respondent and Defendants from engaging in any

26 destructive site work, including without limitation, activities associated with the

27 Addendum;

28 3. For costs of suit incurred herein;

Re: Notice of Intent to Sue

To it Whom it May Concern:

This firm represents the interests of The Board of Trustees of the United Food & Commercial
Workers, Local 135 and United Food and Commercial Workers Union, Local 1.35 (collectively "UFCW") in connection with its concerns over the Mission Valley Home Depot (the "Proposed Project"). Please accept this correspondence that UFCW intends to file suit against the City of San
Diego (the "City") for its approval of Addendum No. 657591 (the "Addendum") and its failure to
proceed in the manner required by law under the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub.
Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.) ("CEQA").

UFCW's action will allege that the City's adoption of the Addendum and approval of the Proposed Project violates CEQA.

The Petition will also seek an award of attorneys' fees and costs under Code of Civil
Procedure section 1021.5. This letter is intended to provide formal notice of the same pursuant to
Graham v. DaimlerChrysler Corp. (2004) 34 Cal.4th 553, 577.
