17 Defendants and Real Parties in Interest.
18

19
20 Plaintiff and Petitioner CORONADO CITIZENS FOR TRANSPARENT GOVERNMENT
21 ("Petitioner") alleges as follows:

22 Parties

23 1. Petitioner is a non-profit, social-advocacy organization formed and operating under the

24 laws of the State of California. At least one of Petitioner's members resides in or near the City of

25 Coronado, California, and has an interest in ensuring open, accountable, responsive government and
26 in protecting the region's environment,
27 2. Defendant and Respondent CITY OF CORONADO ("Respondent") is a public agency

28 under Section 21063 of the Public Resources Code. Respondent is authorized and required by law to

•

1 hold public hearings to determine whether the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") applies

2 to development within its jurisdiction, to determine the adequacy of and certify environmental
3 documents prepared pursuant to CEQA, and to determine whether a project is compatible with the

4 objectives, policies, general land uses, and programs specified in Respondent's General Plan.

5 3. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that Respondent is the

6 applicant for the proposed project that is the subject of this lawsuit.

7 4. The true names and capacities of the Defendants/Respondents identified as DOES 11

8 through 100 and Defendants/Real Parties in Interest identified as DOES 101 through 1,000 are unknown

9 to Petitioner, who will seek the Court's permission to amend this pleading in order to allege the true
10 name and capacities as soon as they are ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that
11 basis alleges that each ofthe fictitiously named Defendants/Respondents 11 through 100 has jurisdiction
12 by law over one or more aspects of the proposed project that is the subject of this lawsuit and that each
13 of the fictitiously named Defendants/Real Parties in Interest 101 through 1,000 either claims an
14 ownership interest in the proposed project or has some other cognizable interest in the proposed project.

15 Background Information

16 5. On or around November 3, 2020, Respondent's city council approved the Golf Course
17 Water Recycling and Turf Care Facility Project ("Project"), a mitigated negative declaration ("MND")
18 | for the Project, and related matters. The Project entails construction and operation of the Satellite Water
19 Recycling Facility and Turf Care Facility at the existing Coronado Municipal Golf Course in the
20 northeastern portion of the City of Coronado.
21 6. Petitioner opposes the Project and challenges certain actions taken by Respondent, In
22 particular, Petitioner seeks to invalidate the approvals with respect to the Project on the grounds, among

23 others, that Respondent has violated CEQA, the Seismic Hazards Mapping Act ("SHMA"), and the
24 Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act ("APEFZA"), and/or other laws.
25 Notice Requirements and Time Limitations

26 7. This lawsuit was commenced not more than 30 days after the notice authorized by Public

27 Resources Code Section 21152(a) was filed (if such a notice was filed).
28

VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE ETC. Page 2

8. Petitioner has caused a Notice of Commencement of Action to be served on Respondent,

2 as required by Public Resources Code Section 21167.5. A true and correct copy of the Notice of
Commencement of Action is attached to this pleading as Exhibit "A."

9. Petitioner will have caused a copy of this pleading to be served on the Attorney General
not more than 10 days after its filing, as required by Public Resources Code Section 21167.7 and Code
6 of Civil Procedure Section 388.

7 Jurisdiction and Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies

8 10. Petitioner seeks review by and relief from this Court under Public Resources Code

Q Section 21168 or 21168.5, as applicable; and Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1060 et seq. and 1084
10 et seq., among other provisions of law.
11 11. Petitioner exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law; by way of

12 example and without limitation, at least one of Petitioner's members expressed opposition to the
13 Project. Additionally and/or alternatively, Petitioner was not required to exhaust its administrative
14 remedies under the circumstances presented by the Project.
15 12. Respondent's conduct in approving the Project without complying with CEQA and other
16 applicable laws constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion because, as alleged in this pleading, it failed
17 to proceed in the manner required by law and made findings not supported by substantial evidence.

18 13. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, since
19| its members and other members of the public will suffer irreparable harm as result of Respondent's
20 violations of CEQA and other laws. Respondent's approval of the Project also rests on its failure to
21 satisfy a clear, present, ministerial duty to act in accordance with those laws. Even when Respondent
22 is permitted or required by law to exercise its discretion in approving projects under those laws, it
23 remains under a clear, present, ministerial duty to exercise its discretion within the limits of and in a
24 manner consistent with those laws. Respondent has had and continues to have the capacity and ability

25 to approve the Project within the time limits of and in a manner consistent with those laws, but
26 Respondent has failed and refuses to do so and has exercised its discretion beyond the limits of and in

27 a manner that is not consistent with those laws.

28

VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE ETC. Page 3

14. Petitioner has a beneficial right and interest in Respondent's fulfillment of all its legal

2 duties, as alleged in this pleading.
3 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION:

4 Illegal Approval and Adoption of Project (Against All Respondents and Real Parties in Interest)

5 15. Paragraphs 1 through 14 are fully incorporated into this paragraph.

6 16. Petitioner is informed and believes and on that basis alleges that the Project does not
7 comply with all applicable laws. By way. of example and without limitation (including alternative

8 theories of liability):

A. The Project violates CEQA. Specifically:

10 Whenever a project proposed to be carried out or approved by a lead

11 agency has the potential to cause an adverse environmental impact, CEQA prohibits the agency from

12 relying on a negative declaration. Instead, CEQA requires the preparation of an environmental impact
13 report to identify and analyze the significant adverse environmental impacts of a proposed project,
14 giving due consideration to both short-term and long-term impacts, providing decision-makers with
15 enough information to enable them to make an informed decision with full knowledge of the likely
16 consequences of their actions, and providing members of the public with enough information to
17 participate meaningfully in the project's approval and environmental-review process. CEQA also
18 requires every environmental impact report to identify and analyze a reasonable range of alternatives

19 to a proposed project. CEQA further requires every environmental impact report to identify and analyze
20 all reasonable mitigation measures for a proposed project's significant adverse environmental impacts.
21 An environmental impact report must be prepared for a proposed project if there is a fair argument,
22 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record, that the project may have an adverse
23 environmental impact; stated another way, a negative declaration may not be used unless the lead
24 agency determines with certainty that there is no potential for the project to have an adverse
25 environmental impact.

26 ii. There is a fair argument that the Project will have significant
27 environmental impacts, By way of example and without limitation, the administrative record is replete

28 with evidence that the Project will result in significant biological, seismic, air quality, and aesthetic

VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE ETC. Page 4

impacts, among other environmental impacts. The Project will also result in cumulative impacts
unaccounted for in the MND.

ili. The Project's significant direct, indirect, or cumulative adverse impacts
on the environment give rise to Respondent's legal obligation to prepare an environmental impact

report.

6 iv. Respondent's failure to prepare an environmental impact report is a

7 violation of CEQA.

8 V. As a result of Respondent's violation of CEQA, Petitioner has been
harmed insofar as Petitioner, its members, other members of the public, and the responsible decision-
10 makers were not fully informed about the potential adverse environmental impacts of the this Project,

11 and insofar as Petitioner, its members, and other members of the public did not have an opportunity to
12 participate meaningfully in the analysis of such impacts prior to approval of the Project.
13 B. The Project violates APEFZA. In particular:

14 i. APEFZA prohibits lead agencies from approving any structure for human

15 occupancy to be built across the trace of active earthquake faults except in accordance with policies and
16 criteria established by the State Mining and Geology Board. The Board's policies and criteria prohibit
17 (f) the placement of a structure for human occupancy across the trace of an active earthquake fault; and

18 (ii) the placement of such a structure within fifty feet of such a fault without an appropriate geologic
19 investigation and report proving that no active fault branches exist within this area, In addition, the
20 Board's policies and criteria require (i) an application for a development permit for a project within a
21 delineated earthquake fault zone to be accompanied by a geologic report directed to the problem of

22 potential surface fault displacement through the project site, unless the report requirement is waived by
23 the lead agency with approval by the State Geologist; (il) a California registered geologist within or
24 retained by the lead agency to evaluate the geologic report for the project and advise the lead agency;
25 and (uit) the lead agency to file a copy of the report with the State Geologist not more than 30 days after
26 the report's acceptance. Respondent has a mandatory duty to ensure that it complies with APEFZA
27 whenever it approves a project.
28

VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE ETC. Page 5

1 ii. The Project is a structure for human occupancy located within an

2 earthquake fault zone; that the application for the Project was not accompanied by the prescribed

3 geologic report, no California registered geologist within or retained by Respondent has evaluated the
report and advised Respondent, and Respondent has not a filed a copy of the report with the State
Geologist after its acceptance; and that Respondent did not require any of the foregoing.
iii. Respondent had clear, present, and mandatory duties not to approve the
Project without complying with APEFZA. Respondent's approval of the Project despite its numerous
failures violates these duties, and Respondent acted unlawfully and in violation of these duties when

9 it approved the Project.

10 C. The Project violates SHMA. In particular:

11 i. SHMA prohibits lead agencies from approving any structure for human
12 occupancy to be built in a seismic hazard zone without first requiring a geotechnical report defining and
13 delincating any seismic hazard, unless there is a finding that no undue seismic hazard exists (in which
14 case the report may be waived). In addition, SHMA requires lead agencies (f) to submit a copy of each
15 approved geotechnical report to the State Geologist not more than thirty days after the report's approval;
16 and (it) in approving any structure for human occupancy to be built in a seismic hazardzone, to consider
17 the policies and criteria established by the State Mining and Geology Board pursuant to SHMA. The
18 Board's policies and criteria provide that (f) any structure for human occupancy to be built in a seismic
19 hazard zone shall be approved only when the nature and severity of the seismic hazards at the site have
20 been evaluated in a geotechnical report and appropriate mitigation measures have been proposed; (if)
21 geotechnical reports may be prepared only by a registered civil engineer or certified engineering
22 geologist having competence in the field of seismic hazard evaluation and mitigation; (üif) geotechnical

23 reports shall contain site-specific evaluations of the seismic hazard affecting the project proposed for
24 the site, (iv) geotechnical reports shall identify portions of the site containing seismic hazards and off-
25 site seismic hazards that could adversely affect the site in the event of an earthquake; (v) geotechnical
26 reports shall include, at a minimum, certain prescribed information about the project and the site; and
27 (vi) lead agencies, prior to approving a project, independently review the geotechnical report to
28 determine the adequacy of the hazard evaluation and proposed mitigation measures and whether the

VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE ETC. Page 6

requirement of certain policies and criteria have been satisfied, with the review being conducted by a
2 registered civil engineer or certified engineering geologist having competence in the field of seismic
3 hazard evaluation and mitigation. Respondent has a mandatory duty to ensure that they comply with
4 SHMA whenever it approves a project.

5 ii. The Project is a structure for human occupancy located within a seismic
6 hazard zone; the prescribed geotechnical report was not prepared for the Project (and there was 1o
7 finding that no undue seismic hazard exists), no copy of the report was submitted to the State Geologist

8 after its approval, and the Board's policies and criteria pursuant to SHMA were not considered as part

9 of the Project's approval; and Respondent failed to require the prescribed geotechnical report to be
10 prepared for the Project, to submit a copy of the report to the State Geologist after its approval, and to
11 consider the Board's policies and criteria pursuant to SHMA as part of the Project's approval.

12 ili. Respondent had clear, present, and mandatory duties not to approve the
13 Project without complying with SHMA. Respondent's approval of the Project despite its numerous
14 failures violates these duties, and Respondent acted unlawfully and in violation of these duties when
15 it approved the Project.
16 17.. There is currently a dispute between Petitioner and Respondent over the Project's legal
17 force and effect. Petitioner contends that the Project has no legal force or effect because it violates
18 CEQA and/or one or more other applicable laws. Respondent disputes Petitioner's contention. The
19 parties therefore require a judicial determination of the Project's legal force and effect (if any).
20 Prayer

21 FOR ALL THESE REASONS, Petitioner respectfully prays for the following relief against all

22 Respondents and Real Parties in Interest (and any all other parties who may oppose Petitioner in this
23 lawsuit):

24 A. A judgment or other appropriate order determining or declaring that Respondents failed

25 to fully comply with CEQA, APEFZA, SHMA, and/or one or more other applicable laws as they relate
26 to the Project and that there must be full compliance therewith before final approval and implementation
27 of the Project may occur;

28

VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE ETC. Page 7

1 B. A judgment or other appropriate order determining or declaring that Respondents failed

2 to comply with CEQA, APEFZA, SHMA, and/or one or more other applicable laws as they relate to

3 the Project and that its approval and implementation was illegal in at least some respect, rendering the
4 approval and implementation null and void;

5 C Injunctive relief prohibiting Respondents (and any and all persons acting at the request

6 of, in concert with, or for the benefit of one or more of them) from taking any action on any aspect of,

7 in furtherance of, or otherwise based on the Project unless and until Respondents comply with CEQA,
8 APEFZA, SHIMA, and all other applicable laws, as determined by the Court;

9 D. Any and all other relief that may be authorized by CEQA, APEFZA, SHMA, or other
10 applicable laws, or any combination of them, but is not explicitly or specifically requested elsewhere
11 in this Prayer;

12 E. Any and all legal fees and other expenses incurred by Petitioner in connection with this
13 lawsuit, including but not limited to reasonable attorney fees as authorized by the Code of Civil
14  Procedure; and

15 F. Any and all further relief that this Court may deem appropriate.

16 Dated: December 1, 2020. Respectfully submitted,
