22 The Petitioner, CITY OF TUSTIN ("City of Tustin"), respectfully petitions this Court
23 for a Writ of Mandate directed to the CITY OF SANTA ANA and CITY COUNCIL OF THE
24 CITY OF SANTA ANA (collectively "Santa Ana"). The City of Tustin alleges as follows:
25 NATURE OF THE CASE
26 1. This Petition challenges the action taken by Santa Ana to approve the Bowery
27 Mixed-Use Project, also referred to as the Warner Redhill Mixed-Use Project, located at 2300,
28 2310, and 2320 South Redhill Avenue in the City of Santa Aña (the "Project"). The Project

3 contemplates redeveloping 14.58-acre site to provide up to 1,150 multi-family residential

4 units and up to 80,000 square feet of commercial retail and restaurant space. The Project

5 proposes three mixed-use buildings that would be six-stories in height and one residential

structure.

8 Legacy master planned community.

3. The Project site is located directly adjacent to the City of Tustin and the Tustin

9

10 Project on August 18, 2020.

4. Santa Ana certified an environmental impact report ("EIR") and approved the

11

12 Santa Ana has a mandatory public duty to comply with the California

WOODRUFF, SPRADLO ATTORNEYS AT LAW 13
& SMART COSTA MESA Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") and all other applicable laws when certifying the EIR
and approving the Project.
5.

14

15

16 Santa Ana's decision to certify the EIR and approve the Project was unlawful

17 because Santa Ana failed to (i) utilize a consistent project description; (ii) utilize a lawful

18 baseline of environmental conditions; (iii) consider adequately the Project's potential adverse

19 environmental impacts; (iv) consider adequately and/or adopt feasible mitigation measures to

20 reduce or avoid significant impacts; (v) adequately respond in writing to significant points

21 raised during the environmental review process; (vi) recirculate the EIR; and (vii) adopt
legally sufficient findings of approval for the Project. Further, the Project is inconsistent with
Santa Ana's General Plan.

GENERAL ALLEGATIONS 19

20 29. The Notice of Preparation ("NOP") for the Project was originally issued on or

31. In a letter dated February 5, 2020, the City of Tustin submitted written comments
2 to Santa Ana on the Draft EIR identifying the legal inadequacies of the document.
3 32. On or about April 27, 2020, Santa Ana posted its Notice of Completion ("NOC")
4 and released the Final EIR and Responses to Comments on the DEIR for the Project, which
5 was received by the City of Tustin Community Development Department on May 7, 2020.
6 33. On or about May 11, 2020, the Santa Ana Planning Commission held a public a
7 hearing regarding the Final EIR. The item was continued to a subsequent Planning
8 Commission public hearing on or about May 26, 2020, in order to address, among other things,
0 concerns raised by the City of Tustin.
10 34. In a letter dated May 21, 2020, the City of Tustin submitted additional written
11 comments on the Final EIR identifying the legal deficiencies of the document.
12 35. On or about May 21, 2020, the Orange County Airport Land Use Commission
NIaVadS 'HHnd0OOM 13 ("Orange County ALUC") held a public hearing and found that the proposed Project was & SMART VS3W VISOO MY1 LY SAENNOLLV 14 inconsistent with the Airport Environs Land Use Plan ("AELUP") for John Wayne Airport
15 ("JWA") per AELUP Sections 1.2 and 2.1.4, and Public Utilities Code section 21674.
16 Essentially, the Orange County ALUC found that the proposed Project is located under the
17 primary aircraft approach corridor to JWA and future residents of the Project will be exposed
18 to significant aircraft overflight and single event noise due to the Project's location.
19 36. On or about May 26, 2020, the Santa Ana Planning Commission held its second
20 public hearing regarding the Final EIR for the Project. The Planning Commission
21 recommended that the City Council certify the Final EIR.
22 37. On or about June 16, 2020, the Santa Ana City Council adopted a Resolution

25 associated with the Project.
26 38. In a letter dated August 18, 2020, the City of Tustin submitted a third written
27 comment letter to Santa Ana regarding the Final EIR identifying the legal inadequacies of the
28 document.

39. The City of Tustin is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that other
2 comment letters were also submitted to and received by Santa Ana prior to certification of the
3 EIR and Project approval. These include, among others, comment letters from the California
4 Department of Toxic Substances, the California Department of Transportation, and the Orange
5 County ALUC.

6 40. On or about August 18, 2020, the Santa Ana City Council adopted a Resolution
7 adopting environmental findings of fact for the proposed Project pursuant to CEQA, certifying
8 the Final EIR, adopting the mitigation monitoring and reporting program, and approving the
9 proposed mixed-use commercial and residential development. The City Council also adopted
10 a Resolution overruling the Orange County ALUC's inconsistency finding for the Project.
11 41. In connection with the Project, Santa Ana also approved a General Plan
12 Amendment, GPA No. 2020-02, to change the General Plan land use designation of the Project
WOODRUFF, SPRADLI 13 MYT LV SAENHOLLY site and Amendment Application, AA No. 2020-01, to rezone the Project site from Light
LHVWS Y COSTA MESA 14 Industrial to (M-1) to Specific Development No. 96 (SD-96).
15 42. On or about September 1, 2020, Councilmember Bacerra made a request for
16 reconsideration of the City's Resolution No. 2020-067, which overruled the Orange County
17 ALUC' s Determination of Inconsistency for the Project. Since Councilmember Bacerra's

19 to the following City Council meeting on or about September 15, 2020.
20 43. On or about September 15, 2020, the Santa Ana City Council considered
21 Councilmember Bacerra's request for reconsideration of Resolution No. 2020-067, which
22 overruled the Orange County ALUC' S Determination of Inconsistency for the Project.
23 Councilmember Bacerra subsequently rescinded his request and no further action was taken
24 on this item.

25 44. On or about September 15, 2020, the Santa Ana City Council executed an
26 Indemnification Agreement with Arrimus Capital, LLC in order to protect Santa Ana against
27 potential aircraft liability in connection with the Project.

45.

6 The City of Tustin incorporates herein by reference paragraphs 1 through 44
above as though fully set forth herein.
46.

7

8 The Project is a discretionary "project" subject to CEQA within the meaning of

9 Public Resources Code sections 21080 and 21065. Therefore, in approving the Project,
Ana was required to comply with all provisions of CEQA. Santa

47.

11 Before the Project may be approved, CEQA requires that Santa Ana (i) identify
all of the Project's potential significant adverse environmental impacts;

12 (ii) identify and adopt

13 feasible mitigation measures that would reduce or avoid any of the Project's significant

& SMART WOODRUFF, SPRADLIN ATTORNEYS AT LAW 14 environmental impacts; (iii) adopt a mitigation reporting or monitoring program, (iv) identify

15 alternatives to the Project which reduce or avoid the Project's significant adverse impacts;

16 (v) adequately respond in writing to significant points raised during the environmental review
process; and (vi) make specific findings in support of its conclusions.
48.

17 Guidelines.

18 49. The EIR fails to comply with the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA

19

20 CEQA is intended to inform governmental decisionmakers and the public of the
environmental consequences of a proposed activity, so that

21 ways of avoiding environmental

22 damage can be identified. The EIR failed to fully inform the City of Tustin and the public of
the environmental consequences of the Project.
50.

23

24 Failure to Use an Accurate, Stable and Finite Project Description. To be
informative and legally sufficient, CEQA requires

25 an EIR to utilize an "accurate, stable and

26 finite project description." (County of Inyo V. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185,

27 199; Code Cal. Regs., tit. 14, § 15124.) Specifically, an accurate and stable project description
is needed to ensure that the decision-makers

28 and the public have enough information to
"ascertain the project's environmentally significant effects, assess ways of mitigating them,
and consider project alternatives." (Sierra Club v. County of Orange (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th

[522208.1 9
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
EXHIBIT A 11

523, 533.)

2 51. The Project description varies within the EIR. The EIR therefore failed to

3 maintain an accurate, stable, and finite project description, precluded the EIR from serving as

4 an informational document, and violates CEQA.

5 52. Failure to Use a Lawful Baseline to Evaluate the Project's Impacts. To

6 determine whether a project's impacts are significant, the project's impacts are compared to

7 existing environmental conditions referred to as the "baseline." With narrow, limited

8 exceptions, the Supreme Court has indicated that the baseline for CEQA purposes is the

9 existing condition at the time the environmental analysis began. (Neighbors for Smart Rail v.
10 Exposition Metro Line Construction Authority (2013) 57 Cal.4th 439, 445.)

11 53. Among other things, Santa Ana's baseline for the Project assumes hypothetical
12 baseline predicated on past uses of the Project site which no longer exist, rather than the
WOODRUFF, SPRADLIN 13 existing conditions. The Project does not fall within any of the exceptions identified by the
& SMART VS3N VISOO MVI IY SANHOLLY 14 Supreme Court. Santa Ana's failure to utilize existing conditions when analyzing the Project's
15 impacts violates CEQA, is unsupported, and masks the Project's significant impacts.
16 54. Failure to Identify and Adequately Analyze and Disclose Project Impacts.
17 CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines require that an EIR identify and focus on the significant

18 environmental effects of the proposed project. (Code Cal. Regs., tit. 14, § 15126(a).) This
19 includes the Project's significant effects not just in Santa Ana but on the environment,
20 including the Project's significant effects in the City of Tustin. (City of San Diego V. Board
21 of Trustees of the California State University (2015) 61 Cal.4th 945, 957.)

22 55. The EIR failed to comply with CEQA by failing to identify and analyze
23 adequately the Project's potential significant environmental impacts, including, but not limited
24 to, impacts in the areas of air quality, hazards, population and housing, recreation, and
25 transportation. The EIR further failed to identify and analyze adequately the Project's
26 cumulative impacts.

27 56. Failure to Adopt Adequate and Feasible Mitigation Measures to Reduce or
28 Avoid the Project's Significant Impacts. Under CEQA, a lead agency must identify and

10

1522208.1 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
EXHIBIT A 12

adopt mitigation measures that will reduce or avoid project's significant environmental

2 effects. (Public Resources Code § 21100(c).) A lead agency must also respond to specific

3 suggestions for mitigating a significant environmental impact unless the suggested mitigation

4 is facially infeasible. (Los Angeles Unified School District v. City of Los Angeles (1997) 58

5 Cal.App.4th 1019, 1029.)

6 57. Santa Ana failed to identify and adopt feasible mitigation measures, and failed

7 to respond adequately to facially feasible suggestions for mitigation measures, and unlawfully

8 deferred mitigation. Without limiting the foregoing, Santa Ana failed to respond adequately

9 to suggestions for mitigation measures that would reduce or avoid significant air quality,

10 hazards, population and housing, recreation, transportation, and cumulative impacts.

11 58. Failure to Adequately Respond to Comments During the Environmental
12 Review Process. Pursuant to CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, lead agencies must evaluate
NTICIVAJS *HNXCOOM 13 comments on the Draft EIR, prepare written responses, and include those written responses in
& SMART ATTORNEYS AT LAW WSSW WISO: 14 the Final EIR. (Public Resources Code § 21091(d).) Where a significant environmental issue
15 is raised in comments on the Draft EIR, the lead agency's response must be detailed and
16 provide a reasoned, good faith analysis in response. (Code Cal, Regs., tit, 14, § 15088(c).)

17 59. The City of Tustin and others provided Santa Ana with detailed written

18 comments raising significant environmental issues, including, issues regarding the Project

19 description, Project baseline, and failure to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's
20 significant air quality, hazards, population and housing, recreation, traffic, and cumulative
21 impacts. Santa Ana did not sufficiently respond to these comments or incorporate those

22 feasible mitigation measures into the EIR,

23 60. Failure to Recirculate the EIR. CEQA requires that if significant new
24 information is added to an EIR after a draft EIR is prepared, but before certification of the final
25 EIR, the EIR must be recirculated for public review.
26 61. Comments submitted to Santa Ana provided significant new information within
27 the meaning of information as defined by Public Resources Code section 21092.1 and

28 California Code of Regulations, Title 14, section 15088.5 including, but not limited to,

information about air quality, hazards, population and housing, recreation, transportation, and
2 cumulative impacts. Despite the availability of this information, Santa Ana failed to
3 recirculate the EIR or any portion of the EIR and, as a result, the public and other public
4 agencies were deprived of any meaningful opportunity to review and comment on the Project,
5 its significant impacts, and the new information regarding the Project's other unanalyzed
6 environmental impacts.

7 62. Santa Ana's failure to recirculate the EIR is not supported by substantial
8 evidence and represents a failure to proceed in the manner required by law.
9 63. Failure to Adopt and Support Legally Adequate Findings. Under CEQA, a
10 lead agency approving a project for which an EIR has been prepared which identifies one or
11 more significant effects must make specified findings supported by substantial evidence in the
12 record. (Public Resources Code §§ 21081, 21081.5.)
WOODRUFF, SPRADLIN 13 64. In approving the EIR, Santa Ana failed to comply with this requirement by & SMART VSEW VISOO MVTLY SAENNOLLV 14 failing to make appropriate findings supported by substantial evidence in the record. Santa
15 Ana's findings were legally deficient as to, among other matters, the determination that certain
16 impacts would be less than significant and/or that adopted mitigation measures would avoid
17 or lessen the Project's significant air quality, hazards, population and housing, recreation,
18 transportation, and cumulative impacts.
19 65. Summary. CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines require that public agencies act to
20 give the fullest possible protection to the environment. (Code Cal. Regs., tit. 14, § 15003.) In
21 adopting the legally defective EIR, Santa Ana failed to comply with this policy and provision
22 of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.
23 66. The inadequacies described above are prejudicial and require Santa Ana's
24 approval of the Project to be set aside until legally adequate environmental review in
25 compliance with CEQA is completed.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 1

2 (Petition for Writ of Mandate Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085 and 1094.5 -
3 Violation of Santa Ana General Plan Against All Respondents and Real Parties in
Interest) 4

5 67. The City of Tustin incorporates herein by reference paragraphs 1 through 66
6 above as though fully set forth herein.

7 68. A proposed project must be compatible with the objectives and policies of the
8 general plan. (Naraghi Lakes Neighborhood Preservation Association v. City of Modesto
9 (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 9, 17.) This includes projects in Santa Ana. (Santa Ana Municipal Code
10 27-21; Santa Ana General Plan Policies 1.4, 1.6, 4.3.)
11 69. A project is inconsistent with the general plan if it will not further the objectives
12 and policies of the general plan and will obstruct their attainment. (Friends of the Lagoon
13
LaVNS Y NITaVadS 'aanadoom Valley V. City of Vacaville (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 807, 817.) 3 VSON V.IS0O LY SAENgOLLY 14 70. Santa Ana's General Plan includes, among others, the following transportation
15

a. Maintain at least a level of service "D" on arterial street intersections, objectives and policies:

16

17 except in major development areas. (Policy 1.4.)
18 b. Limit the number of driveways on arterial streets to reduce vehicular
conflict and facilitate traffic flow. (Policy 2.1.) 19

20 71. The Project is inconsistent with these objectives and policies because: (a) the
21 Project's traffic analysis did not follow Santa Ana's traffic impact analysis guidelines; (b) the
22 Project will cause Santa Ana's accepted levels of service to be exceeded; and (c) the Project
23 includes driveways on an arterial without dedicated turn lanes that will create traffic safety
24 hazards.

25 72. Santa Ana's General Plan includes, among others, the following park and
26 recreation objectives and policies:
27 a. Provide sufficient open space to meet the recreational and aesthetic needs
28 of the community. (Goal 1.)

13
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
15 1522208.1 EXHIBIT A

1 b.

2 Provide quality open space in quantities adequate for the type and

3 intensity of surrounding development. (Open Space, Parks and

4 Recreation Element, p. 10.)

C. Treat

5 open space development and upgrading as priority investment

6 73. objectives. (Open Space, Parks and Recreation Element, p. 10.)

7 The Project is inconsistent with these objectives and policies because it does not:

8 (a) provide sufficient open space to meet the needs of the community; (b) provide quality open

9 space in quantities adequate for the type and intensity of development; or (c) prioritize open
space development.
10 74.

11 Specifically, among other things, Santa Ana counted private balconies,

12 walkways, paseos, and unusable perimeter landscape areas as open space and/or towards the

& SMART WOODRUFF, SPRADLIN MVT1Y SANJOLIY 13
COSTA MESA minimum parkland requirement for the Project. Santa Ana's own Planning Commissioner

14 questioned this approach. Santa Ana has failed to explain or support this approach with
substantial evidence.

15

16 75. REQUESTED RELIEF

17 The City of Tustin incorporates herein by reference paragraphs 1 through 74

18 above as though fully set forth herein.

19 Writ of Mandate

20 76. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5; Code of Civ. Pro. §§ 1085, 1094.5)

21 Santa Ana has violated a duty which the law specially enjoins, and the City of

22 Tustin has a clear, present and substantial right to the performance of the Santa Ana's duty.
77.

23 The City of Tustin has a beneficial interest in the issuance of a writ of mandate.

24 As explained above, the Project will result in unanalyzed and unmitigated significant impacts

25 in the City of Tustin, and the City of Tustin proceeds in the public interest. The City of Tustin
has a

26 beneficial interest in issuance of the writ for the separate reason that the City of Tustin

27 presented written evidence at hearings held by Santa Ana on the Project.
78.

28 The City of Tustin has performed all conditions precedent to issuance of a writ
of mandate. Without limiting the foregoing, the City of Tustin has exhausted all administrative

1522208.1 14 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
EXHIBIT A 16

1 remedies as described above.

2 79. The City of Tustin has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary
3 course of law other than the relief sought herein.
4 Temporary and Permanent Injunctive Relief

5 (Code Civ. Proc. §§ 526, 527; Civ. Code, § 3422)
6 80. Courts may issue temporary and permanent injunctive relief pursuant to Code of
7 Civil Procedure section 526; a temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction
8 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 527; and a permanent injunction pursuant to Civil
9 Code section 3422. (See San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center v. County of Stanislaus
10 (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 713.)
11 81. The City of Tustin is entitled to a writ of mandate for the reasons described
12 above.

13 82. If Santa Ana and the Real Parties in Interest are not enjoined from proceeding
& SMART NITAVadS "JN8COOM MWI LY SAENHOLI' SEN VISOO 14 with the Project, the Project would cause great and irreparable injury to human health and the
15 environment.

16 83. Pecuniary compensation would not afford adequate relief to the environment,
17 the City of Tustin, or the public.
18 84, If the Project is allowed to proceed, any judgment in the City of Tustin's favor
19 would be ineffectual - significant damage to human health and the environment will have
20 already occurred.

Attorneys' Fees 21

22 85. With this Petition, the City of Tustin seeks to enforce an important right affecting
23 the public interest. If the lawsuit is successful, the City of Tustin will confer a substantial
24 benefit on the region and its residents. Thus, the City of Tustin will be entitled to an award of
25 reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to section 1021.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
PRAYER FOR RELIEF 26

27 WHEREFORE, the City of Tustin prays that this Court:
28 1. Issue a peremptory writ of mandate:

15 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
EXHIBIT A 17 1522208.1

a. Voiding Santa Ana's action in approving the Project and certifying the EIR;
2 b. Directing Santa Ana to rescind, vacate, and set aside Santa Ana's approval

4 issuance of the Notice of Determination;
5 C. Directing Santa Ana to suspend immediately all activity in furtherance or

6 implementation of the Project;
7 d. Directing Santa Ana to prepare a revised draft environmental impact report,
8 consistent with the requirements of CEQA, before taking any further action
9 on the Project;
10 e. Directing Santa Ana to take all actions necessary to comply with CEQA in
11 connection with the Project.
12 2. Issue temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent
NI TAVadS 'HnACOOM 13 injunction restraining Santa Ana and the Real Parties in Interest from taking MYTLY SAENJOLLV & SMART VSUW VISOS 14 any action in furtherance of the Project while the litigation is pending.
15 3. Award the City of Tustin its costs of suit incurred and reasonable attorneys'
16 fees including, but not limited to, fees authorized under Code of Civil Procedure sections
17 1021.5, 1032, and Government Code section 800.

18 4. Retain jurisdiction over Santa Ana's proceedings by way of a return to the
19 peremptory writ until the court has determined that Santa Ana has complied with CEQA.
20 5. Award such other relief as the court may deem just and proper.
