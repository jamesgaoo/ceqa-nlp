2 Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition"), as follows:

INTRODUCTION 3

1. Petitioner challenges the adoption by Respondent City of Monterey Park ("City"

5 or "Respondent") of an Environmental Impact Report, the related discretionary

6 approvals/ordinances and resolutions declaring an emergency and authorizing contracting
7 without formal bidding (together, the "Project Approvals") for the proposed development located

8 at 1688 West Garvey Avenue, Monterey Park, CA (the "Project"). As noted below, the City
failed to follow the required procedures required by the California Environmental Quality Act
10 ("CEQA") when it certified the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Project. The
11 failure to follow these procedures was prejudicial in that it precluded informed decision-making. 8 d77 Group, MET |uueyO - LZ06 BLNS "PALE IJJUSIIM E888 Moreover, implementation of the Project will have substantial adverse impacts on the
13 environment. Additionally, the City failed to comply with mandatory procedures of the 12

SI!H ueAg 14 Government Code that require certain zoning ordinances be considered the Planning
15 Commission before they are adopted and at least two readings of a zoning ordinance by the City
16 Council.

17 Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the
Project Approvals considered by Respondent, including rescinding any authorizations to proceed 2.

20 failed to comply with the Government Code's procedures regarding adoption of zoning
21 ordinances. The Monterey Park City Council certified the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR")
22 for the Project on or about June 16, 2021. The City also approved a Zone Change, a Vesting

24 resolution declaring an emergency and authorizing contracting without formal bidding and 23 Tentative Map and approved a Development Agreement for the Project. The City also adopted a

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 set forth under the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000,

2 et seq. ("CEQA"), and therefore failed to proceed in a manner required by law. Respondent also

3 failed to comply with Government Code Section 65853-65857 (which requires certain zoning

4 ordinances be first considered by the Planning Commission) and Government Code Section
5 36934 (which requires at least two readings of a zoning ordinance before it is adopted).

6 3. Petitioner seeks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under California Code of Civil
7 Procedure section 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate, rescind and set aside all Project
8 Approvals and the EIR because Respondent failed to comply with CEQA.
PARTIES

10 4. Petitioner Save Our Slopes is an unincorporated association dedicated to the

24 Recorder.
25 7. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties sued herein
26 as DOES 1-25, inclusive, and therefore sues these Real Parties by such fictitious names.

PROJECT 15

16 12. The Project is located at 1688 West Garvey Avenue in Monterey Park, California.
proposed Project includes the development of 16 single-family residences on a 6.22-acre site 17 || The
18 located at 1688 West Garvey Avenue in the City of Monterey Park. The Project would involve
19 grading and installation of retaining walls and geotechnical improvements (overexcavations and
20 soil removals, recompaction, soil anchors and installation of engineered stabilization products) to
21 stabilize the onsite slopes to facilitate construction of 16 new single-family residences, a private
22 access road, and an open space lot. Two new retaining walls would be installed on the Project
to help stabilize the regraded slopes and would consist of a Lower Site Retaining Wall below 23 site
24 the houses along West Garvey Avenue and an Upper Site retaining wall along the west side of
25 the private access road. The proposed vesting tentative map shows that Lots 1 through 16 are the
26 residential lots; Lot A, the private access road; and Lot B would be preserved as open space. The
27

4 28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 residential lots would range in size from 7,515 square feet to 15,369 square feet in size.
2 13. The proposed 1688 West Garvey Avenue Specific Plan consists of a master
3 landscape plan and design and development standards and guidelines for the proposed retaining

4 walls and new residences. Project processing and review procedures are also included in the

5 Specific Plan

h 14. The project parcel common spaces and improvements will be included in a
7 Geologic Hazard Abatement District (GHAD) that will assess and collect fees, maintain and
8 improve the parcel as necessary and determined by the GHAD Board.
15. The General Plan Land Use designation for the site is High Density Residential.

10 The zoning designation of the Site is High-Density Residential (R-3). The High-Density
11 Residential land use and zoning designations allow a broad range of dwelling unit types, which 8 2A0  VPANE TH ASIDNGCSSO SIl!H ÁueAeg 12 may be attached or detached at a density of up to 25 units per acre.
'dnous 13 16. The Project Site is bordered by West Garvey Avenue on the north and east and
MET |OuueYO 14 Abajo Drive to the east. St. Steven's Serbian Orthodox Church is located north of the Site and
15 Garvey Avenue, with single-family residences located north of the church. The Abajo del Sol
16 senior apartment complex is located east of the Project Site between Abajo Drive and S. Fremont
17 Ave. Auto repair uses are located between South Fremont Avenue, Garvey Avenue, and
18 Monterey Pass Road. Single-family residences are located west of the Project Site.
19 17. The applicant for the Project sought the following three entitlements: (1) Zone
20 Change from R-3 to Specific Plan ZC-21-01, (2) Vesting Tentative Map No. 21-01, (3)
21 Development Agreement DA-21-01. In addition to the entitlements, the City adopted the 1688
22 West Garvey Avenue Specific Plan (SP-21-01) in order to facilitate the Project.
23 PROJECT BACKGROUND, ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL

24 18. The Project site was originally approved for development in 1978 and 1979 for 31
25 residential dwelling unit. That original project was developed by the Good Views Land
26 Development Company ("Good Views").
27

5 28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 19. The property is historically unstable. In 1983, Garvey Avenue was damaged, and

2 blocked, by a slope failure resulting in the City taking emergency action to construct various soil
3 stabilization and drainage infrastructure. In 1986, the City entered into an agreement with the

4 Good Views developer to construct permanent structures intended to stabilize the hillside that

5 was to be completed by December 5, 1986.

20. In 1987, 1988, and 1989, a number of City consultants advised the City regarding
what measures were required to stabilize the hillside. The Good Views property owner failed to
8  implement any of those recommendations. a As a result, the City in 1991 issued a notice of
9 violation to Good Views that the Project site constituted a public nuisance requiring abatement.
10 In 1997, the City Council declared the property to be a public nuisance and commenced abating

8 11 the property. Among other things, it installed a gate on the abandoned private road. The City Channel Law *dnoJg d17 LIZ06 E}nS "PALE EJJyS|IM €888 12 took additional abatement action in 2000 and 2002.
13 21. Starting in 2013, the City again undertook various code enforcement actions 8
S|!H Áueneg 14 against the new property owneri of 1600-1688 West Garvey Avenue.
15 22. Concerned that the El Niño storms in 2015 would result in significant slope

16 failure at the property, the City filed a civil lawsuit against the property owners to abate the
17 nuisances on the property. That lawsuit allowed the City to immediately take action to
18 temporarily stabilize the hillside. Those efforts, however, did not constitute a permanent solution
19 to the overall issue of hillside stability.

20 23. On April 25, 2017, the City entered into a settlement agreement with the property

21 owner which includes a plan for a long-term solution to the hillside. In short, the Settlement
22 Agreement requires the property owner to stabilize the hillside through a series of retaining walls
23 and other geotechnical solutions. This can be accomplished in one of two ways. "Plan A" is for

24 the hillside stabilization to occur via developing the site with residential homes. Under Plan A,
25 the hillside stabilization would be incorporated into the overall design and construction of that
26 residential development. Any such development, however, requires the discretionary approval of
27

5 voluntarily, then the City will complete that project at the property owner's cost.
6 25. Real Party in Interest opted to pursue "Plan A" and applications for the requested
7 entitlements were filed on or about July 2, 2020.

8 A draft environmental impact report (DEIR) was prepared pursuant to CEQA
Guidelines §15151. On July 22, 2020, the City circulated a Notice of Preparation (NOP) with an 26.

10 Initial Study for review and comment by the public, responsible agencies, and reviewing
11 agencies. The 30-day review period for the NOP ended on August 22, 2020. The City released 8 d77 'dnois 1LZ06 12 the Draft EIR for a 45-day period for review and comment from March 11, 2021 to April 26,
13 8 PHNS PALE BJUS|!M €8€8 2021. A number of agency and public comments were received during public review.
14 27. The FEIR includes a discussion and analysis of the following project alternatives: MET euueuO 'SIl!H ÁLeAea 15 Alternative 1: No Project Alternative
16 Alternative 2: Multi-Family Development Alternative
17 Alternative 3: Alternative Retaining Wall Design

Environmental Impact Report, approved all of the requested entitlements and adopted the 1688 28. On June 16, 2021, the City Council conducted a public hearing, certified the Final
20

21 West Garvey Avenue Specific Plan. The City waived the first reading of the ordinances for the
22 Zone Change and Specific Plan. The City also used the FEIR as an environmental clearance to
23 approve a resolution declaring an emergency and authorizing the City Manager to Contract
24 without the need for bidding pursuant to Public Contracts § Code 8 22050 to construct hillside
25 stabilization at 1688 West Garvey Avenue. This resolution was adopted in the event that the City
26 had to pursue Plan B in the settlement agreement with Real Party. The City also asserted that the

7 27

28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 waiver of bidding procedures was exempt from additional CEQA review because such actions
2 were being made to "protect public and private property and necessary to maintain services

3 essential to the public, health and welfare."

29. The City filed a Notice of Determination with the County Recorder on June 24,

5 2021.

6 CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

7 30. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public
8 agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental

9 implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the
10 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure

LLZ06
8 Chamnel uav Group, tel yEso 11 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires
eHNS "pAa BJIJySIM E8E8 12 governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects
13 of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
'SIllH Áueneg 14 otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with
15 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
16 31. CEQA is California's broadest environmental law and helps to guide public
17 agencies such as the City during issuance of permits and approval of projects. Courts have
18 interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest protection of the environment within the reasonable scope

19 of the statutes. CEQA applies to all discretionary projects proposed to be conducted or approved
20 by a City, including private projects requiring discretionary government approval. See California
21 Public Resources Code, sections 21000 - 21178, and Title 14 Cal. Code Regs., section 753, and
22 Chapter 3, sections 15000 - 15387.
23 32. A strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an Environmental
24 Impact Report ("EIR") is built into CEQA which is reflected in what is known as the "fair
25 argument" standard, under which an agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence

26 in the record supports a fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the

(VIOLATION OF CEQA) 20

21 35. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
22 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
23 36. The City's Initial Study screened out the following environmental resource
24 categories as less than significant: (1) Biological Resources,, (2) Hydrology/Water Quality, (3)
25 Recreation, (4) Utilities/Service Systems, (5) Agriculture and Forestry, (6) Cultural Resources,
26 (7) Greenhouse Gas Emissions, (8) Population/Housing, (9) Wildfire, (10) Energy, (11) Hazards

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 & Hazardous Materials, (12) Mineral Resources, and (13) Public Services. The City also
2 determined that all of the remaining categories could be mitigated and did not adopt a Statement
3 of Overriding Considerations. However, the City received public comments on the Draft

4 Environmental Impact Report indicating that the Project would result in significant
5 environmental impacts to environmental resources categories screened out and that the

6 mitigation measures proposed were inadequate.

7 37. For example, the City received two comment letters from the California

8 Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW") dated March 12-13, 2021 and April 15, 2021.

9 a CDFW is a trustee agency under CEQA. A "trustee agency" is defined in Public Resources Code
10 as "a state agency that has jurisdiction by law over natural resources affected by a project, that
11 are held in trust for the people of the State of California." Public Resources Code § 21070. The 8 Channel Law Group, d77 --Z06 12

13
& BINS 'PAE EJJySIM €8C8 CEQA Guidelines state that a trustee agency "means a state agency having jurisdiction by law
over natural resources affected by a project which are held in trust for the people of the State of
SIllH AueAg 14 California. Trustee agencies include: (a) The California Department of Fish and Game with
15 regard to the fish and wildlife of the state, to designated rare or endangered native plants, and to
16 game refuges, ecological reserves, and other areas administered by the department." California
17 Code of Regulations § 15386.
18 38. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife, formerly known as the California

19 Department of Fish and Game, is a state agency under the California Natural Resources Agency.
20 The Department has been tasked with a key role in reviewing environmental documents to assess
21 biological impacts to fish and wildlife resources. Fish & Game Code D 1802 states as follows:
22 The Department has "jurisdiction over the conservation, protection, and management of fish, wildlife, native plants, and habitat necessary for biologically sustainable populations
23 of those species. The department, as trustee for fish and wildlife resources, shall consult with lead and responsible agencies and shall provide, as available, the requisite biological 24 expertise to review and comment upon environmental documents and impacts arising those terms are used in the California Environmental Protection 25 from project activities, as Act (Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code).
26 39. In its letters to the City, CDFW outlined potentially significant environmental
27

10 28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 impacts to biological resources and suggested the addition of five mitigation measures. However,

2 the City responded and stated as follows: "As there are no biological resource impacts beyond

3 potential impacts to nesting birds during construction, no additional mitigation measures or
conditions of approval are required to mitigate potential biological impacts." CDFW, a trustee

5 agency, provided substantial evidence in its letter that the Project will cause biological impacts

6 beyond the mere potential impacts to nesting birds. Additionally, the City erred when it
7 concluded that there could be no biological impacts associated with the removal of non-native
8 species simply because the "Monterey Park General Plan and Municipal Code do not include
9 protection for biological resources, including trees, on private property." The fact that the City

10 does not have regulations in place is irrelevant as to the potential for impacts under CEQA.
11 40. The City violated CEQA when it screened out the following environmental +4Z06 MP ST B MIS IA A B E OE 'SIllH AueARg d11 'dnoJ9 MET |euueuO 12 resource categories: (1) Biological Resources, (2) Hydrology/Water Quality, (3) Recreation, (4)
13 Utilities/Service Systems, (5) Agriculture and Forestry, (6) Cultural Resources, (7) Greenhouse
14 Gas Emissions, (8) Population/Housing, (9) Wildfire, (10) Energy, (11) Hazards & Hazardous
15 Materials, (12) Mineral Resources, and (13) Public Services. Respondent received comments
16 from the general public and other public agencies demonstrating that the Project has the potential
17 for significant environmental impacts to these environmental resource categories. The City
18 violated CEQA by failing to further evaluate these impacts in the EIR prepared for the Project
19 and preparing appropriate mitigation measures. The City also violated CEQA when it determined
20 that the mitigation measures proposed for the Project would avoid and/or minimize
21 environmental impacts.

22 Inadequate Findings
23 41. CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be
24 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that a lead
25 agency provide an explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions it has
26 reached.

27

11 28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 42. Respondent violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter a

2 of law in that they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including, but not
3 limited to, the following.

a. The determination that certain impacts would be less than significant and/or that adopted
5 mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the Project's significant effects on the

0 environment;

7 b. The determination that alternatives to the Project and proposed mitigation measures that

8 would have avoided or lessened the significant impacts of the Project were unnecessary;

9 C. All determinations which relied on the inadequate EIR and other legally defective

10 documents or analyses.

11 Inadequate Response to Comments
L1Z06 12 43. Petitioner's members submitted comments which questioned the adequacy of the

8 OSL OUNS "PAIE EIIUSIIM E8E8 Channel Law Group, LLP 13| Projects' environmental analyses. However, many of the City's responses were evasive. By
SIl!H fueneg 14 failing to provide adequate responses to public comments and proposed alternatives, Respondent
15 failed to proceed in the manner required by law. Moreover, Respondent's finding that adequate
16 responses to comments were provided is not supported by substantial evidence.
17 44. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion
18 by failing to comply with the procedures outlined in the CEQA Guidelines and failing to conduct
19 an adequate environmental review for the Project. Accordingly, Respondent's EIR must be set
20 aside.

21 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

22 (VIOLATION OF GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION 65853-65857)
23 45. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
24 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
25 46. Government Code Section 65853 states, in part, as follows: "A zoning ordinance

19 (VIOLATION OF GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION 36934)
20 50. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
21 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
22 51. The California Government Code requires that an ordinance have two "readings"
23 before they it be adopted by a general law city such as Monterey Park. Government Code
24 Section 36934 states as follows:
25 Ordinances shall not be passed within five days of their introduction, nor at other than
a regular meeting or at an adjourned regular meeting. However, an urgency ordinance
26 may be passed immediately upon introduction and either at a regular or special mecting. Except when, after reading the title, further reading is waived by regular 27 motion adopted by majority vote all ordinances shall be read in full either at the time

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 of introduction or passage. When ordinances, other than urgency ordinances, are altered after introduction, they shall be passed only at a regular or at an adjourned regular meeting held at least five days after alteration. Corrections of typographical or
clerical errors are not alterations within the meaning of this section.
52. Respondent violated Government Code Section 36934 by attempted to "waive"
the first reading and adopting the ordinance at the City Council hearing on June 16, 2021.
Members of the public urged the City not to approve the Project and adopt the ordinance at this
6 hearing but the City ignored those pleas. Zoning Ordinance ZC-21-01 was not adopted as an
7 urgency ordinance.
8
53. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion
by failing to comply with the procedures outlined in the Government Code. Accordingly,
10 Respondent's Project Approvals must be set aside.
