.--- FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

Petitioner/Plaintiff California Commercial Investment Group, Inc. ("CCI") brings this
2 action challenging Respondent/Defendant City of Agoura Hills's (the "City") unlawful denial of a
3 development permit, concurrent misuse of the processes set forth in the California Environmental

4 Quality Act ("CEQA"), various violations of the Government Code and alleges as follows:

5 INTRODUCTION

6 1. California Governor Gavin Newsom made going "bold" on the state's housing
7 crisis-a "Marshall Plan" for housing a centerpiece of his recent campaign. The City of Agoura

8 Hills apparently has decided that using a web of regulatory obstacles to block any such plans is the

9 best way to ensure that Governor Newsom's objectives are met somewhere, anywhere, other than
10 within its city limits. Indeed, the City has only approved a scattering of housing developments

11 over the past eighteen years, and just one known multi-family project has been built in the City in
12 that same timeframe. The City's efforts to stand in the way of any solutions to the crisis-and
13 thereby put the brakes on a development already "deemed complete"-are the focus of this action.

14 2. This action is a direct result of the City's ongoing and improper efforts to block
15 new developments, even those that will benefit the City's residents and ease the housing crisis in
16 the State of California. The City created a system that is rigged against developers, and CCI-like
17 numerous others before it-suffered as a result. Specifically, the City improperly denied
18 development permits that had been in the works for seven years through a misapplication of
19 CEQA, through various violations of the Government Code and by means of a system so tortured,
20 convoluted and interminable that it is set up for applicants like CCI to fail.

21 3. Since 2015, CCI has been trying to get a permit to develop a bare 18-acre lot on the
22 southeast corner of Kanan and Agoura Roads: CCI's proposed Agoura Village East ("AVE")
23 Housing and Commercial Mixed Use Development Project (the "Project"). The AVE would have
24 commercial and residential buildings where people can live, shop, work and eat. It would provide
25 housing, jobs, a forum for businesses, support for the local community and tax revenue for the
26 City. The City deemed CCI's application complete in October 2018 and the CEQA draft
27 environmental impact report ("EIR") was close to being final. There was no legitimate reason to
28 block the Project.

1947567.3 -2-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

P hearing on the Project, but the City was not keen on giving CCI that opportunity, and so it relied
2 on its pretextual and inconsistent findings to deny the Project outside of the normal course.

3 8. Indeed, nothing in Section 21080(b)(5) authorizes a City to bail on its statutory
4 obligation to comply with CEQA's report requirement for an arbitrary reason - let alone at the
5 eleventh hour, after an applicant invested seven years and millions of dollars into a protracted and

6 laborious application process. Here, the City made incessant demands for information and
7 documents, and more demands, and then more demands before it finally pulled the plug with
8 virtually no notice to CCI. The City did this through improper processes, violating CCI's
9 constitutional rights and in violation of the Government Code. Nor does the City have the right to
10| improperly withhold the draft EIR to which CCI has rights to see, both as the applicant who paid

11 for it and as a public record under California's Public Records Act ("PRA").

12 9. None of the City's misconduct can be remedied without judicial relief.

13 PARTIES

14 10. Petitioner/Plaintiff California Commercial Investment Group, Inc. is a California
15 corporation with its principal place of business located in California.

16 11. Respondent/Defendant City of Agoura Hills is a municipal corporation organized
17 and existing under the laws of the State of California, located entirely within the County of Los
18 Angeles, California.

19 12. DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, are sued herein under fictitious names. CCI does
20 not at this time know the true names or capacities of these defendants but sues said defendants by

21 such fictitious names under Code of Civil Procedure section 474. When the true names and

22 capacities of said fictitiously named defendants have been ascertained, CCI will seek leave of the
23 Court to amend its Complaint to insert the proper names and capacities in lieu of such fictitious
24 names. CCI is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that DOES 1 through 20, and each
25 of them, were in some manner responsible for the acts alleged herein.

26 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

27 13. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action under Code of Civil
28 Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5.

1947567.3 -4-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

22. CCI is the developer for a property at the southeast corner of Kanan and Agoura
2 Roads (the "Property') in Agoura Hills, just south of the 101 Freeway, the intended purpose of
3 which is as a housing and commerciai dévelopment consistent ntisistent with the mixed use requirements of
the AVSP. The AVE would be a new town center for Agoura Hills with fifteen buildings for

6 apartments, a hotel, retail stores, restaurants and office space. * '

B.

7 23. . CCI Applies for Permits to Develop the Proiect
On September 30, 2015, CCI submitted permit applications for the Project to the
8 Agoura Hills Planning Commission: the Agoura Villagé Development Permit application
9 (including the Oak Trèe Permit application) (collectively the "AVDP*) and Vesting Tentative
10 Tract Map (*VTTM"). The City responded by deeming the applications "incomplete" and setting
11 forth a list of additional requirements that had to be submitted. . .'

12 24.: For the next three years thereafter; the City sent CCI a series of "deemed
13 incomplete" letters. Each one contained a dizzying array of questions regarding minute
14 technicalities and consistently held out the possibility of future questions and response items and
15 eventual deemed complete status. For example; the City's June 10, 2016 letter included 114
16 individual follow-up items, several of them with sub-items, and reserved comment about a variety
17 of CCI's technical reports. (Jüne 10, 2016 Letter from Ässistant Planning Director to CCI.) The
18 City's January 22, 2018 letter, more thän two years after CCI first submitted its formal
19 applications, included 39 separate follow-up itemns. (January 22, 2018 Letter from Assistant
20 Planning Director to CCI.) 'CCI diligently complied with each of the City's requests, believing
21 that it was working in good faith to move the Project forward to completion.

22 25. Finally, on September 25, 2018, after CCI's sixth planning submittal and three
23 years of formal application processing, the City finally deemed the applications complete.
24| (September 25, 2018-Letter from' Assistänt Planning Director to CCI.) Yet, even after the
25 applications were deemed complete; the City continued to concoct new issues and demand
26 additional submittals from CCI. The City sent a series of letters to CCI making additional requests
27 for information and alleging several new inconsistencies with the AVSP, requiring CCI to submit
28 eleven additional plänning sets. •The Citÿ fürther gave conflicting information

for approving the building heights as proposed; City staff acknowledged this in a letter to the
2 applicant, then did an about face later in the process. The City further refused to allow CCI to

3 request any AVSP flexibility from the City decision-makers as the AVDP process contemplates.
4 City staff also informed CCI that revising its VTTM application to achieve conformance with the

5 setback requirements would forfeit CCI's legal "vested" status as of the deemed complete date on

6 September 25, 2018.

7 32. On July 29, 2021, CCI timely filed an appeal of the Planning Commission's July
8 15, 2021 decision to deny the permit applications to the City Council.
9 33. Despite this denial, CCI submitted alternative plans as part of its objection letter to
10 the City Council to provide evidence that CCI was actually working on the plan in good faith.

11 34. On September 8, 2021, the City Council rejected the appeal and voted to uphold the
12 Planning Commission's denial of the Project.

13 E. The City Abused Its Discretion in Denying the Project

14 35. These actions above show that the City, without clear justification or evidence,
15 ignored the provisions of the AVSP. As described above, the stated basis for denying the Project
16 is its supposed inconsistency with three AVSP development standards: (1) setbacks, (2) building
17 height and (3) maximum number of dwelling units in a vertical mixed-use building. However,
18 each of these alleged inconsistencies was based on shifting City interpretations of the development
19 standards after the deemed complete date, and/or faulty information in the staff report and

20 findings.

21 36. In fact, for two of the City's three stated bases for denying the Project, building
22 setbacks and the permitted number of vertical mixed-use residential units, the City only identified
23 the alleged inconsistency after the AVDP and VTTM applications were officially deemed
24 complete.

25 37. For the third stated basis for denying the Project, building height, the AVSP
26 presented a clear path for approving the Project as proposed. The City's shifting interpretations of
27 development standards, refusal to allow the Applicant to request any AVSP flexibility from the
28 City decision-makers as the AVDP process contemplated and conclusory findings for denial

1947567.3 -9-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 constitute textbook abuse of discretion.

2 1. Setbacks

3 38. The first stated basis for denying the Project was the supposed inconsistency with
4 the AVSP development standards regarding setbacks.

39.

6 More than a year before the Project applications were deemed complete, the City
acknowledged that some of the Project's proposed front and side setbacks were greater than the
7 maximums stipulated in the 'AVSP.

8 40. In a January 30, 2017 letter to CCI, regarding the proposed front and side setbacks,
9 the City stated: "We understand that the additional setback beyond the maximum stipulated is

-1- a 10 provided to accommodate outdoor dining, and other sidewalk amenities, which are beneficial. . ..

11
- - We understand that the spaces in between the frontage buildings are either used as vehicle
12 driveways or for outdoor dining or other pedestrian amenities, and so are beneficial." To CCI's
13 knowledge, none of the subsequent communications from the City between the January 30, 2017
14 letter and the deemed complete date of September 25, 2018 ever again addressed building setbacks

15 or their alleged inconsistency.

-..-d 16 41.

17 For example, the Land Use/Economic Development Committee ("LU/EDC") did

•-. • .- not make any comments on the Project regarding the building setbacks' alleged inconsistency at
18| its meeting on March 1, 2017. To the contrary, the LU/EDC's comments directed CCI to

! 19| "[c]onsider a wider space at the corner of Kanan/Agoura Roads near the water feature, to further
20| 'open up' the space to the public, and work with City staff." (Emphasis added.) The LU/EDC's
21 direction, however, actually would have exacerbated the Project's noncompliance with the
22 AVSP's maximum 10-foot side yard setback standard if based on the City's belated and overly
23 rigid interpretation of the A'VSP development standards.

24 42. The AVSP specifically cites "flexibility to development standards" as part of the
25 Specific Plan implementation program, (AVSP, at p. 8-103.), and the City's current 2013-2021

777. 71 26 Housing Element also explicitly takes credit for the AVSP as relieving the governmental

27 constraint on housing caused by City processing and permit procedures. One of the Housing
28 Element's goals is to "[p]rovide flexibility in development standards to accommodate new models

1947567.3 -10-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

and approaches to providing housing, such as mixed use and live/work housing." (2013-2021
2 Housing Element, at p. V-13.) The Housing Element states that development within the AVSP
3 undergoes a "unique review process to enhance development flexibility and innovation," and that
4 the City Council has declared development within Agoura Village as a priority. (Id. at p. III-18.)
In fact, the Housing Element specifically discusses the AVSP's building setback requirements,

6 stating that "[b]uilding setbacks are minimal to create a vibrant, walkable village environment"
7 and that the AVSP development standards provide for "minimal setback requirements." (Id. at pp.

8 III-4 and IV-6.) The Housing Element provides further, "[t]he City's policy is to work with
9 applicants early on in the process to expedite processing of applications within the Agoura Village
10 Specific Plan, with goal of completing concept review through entitlement approval within one
11 year." (Id. at p. HII-18.)

12 43. CCI reasonably relied on the January 30, 2017 letter, these subsequent
13 communications, and the AVSP and Housing Element in its understanding that consensus with
14 City Planning staff and advisory bodies was reached regarding both the Project's proposed
15 setbacks and the procedural path for approving them.3

16 44. Yet, less than a month after deeming the Project applications-including the
17 VTTM application-complete, the City completely reversed its interpretation regarding setbacks.
18 In an October 16, 2018 letter to CCI, staff stated that some buildings did not comply with the

19 minimum and maximum setback requirements and that "[t]he project need[ed] to be revised to
20 meet the applicable setback standards.»4

21

22 For example, the City previously determined that a project's setbacks could deviate from the AVSP's standards through the AVDP process. On March 8, 2017, the City Council approved an 23 AVDP for the Cornerstone mixed-use project at the southeast corner of Cornell Road and Agoura Road, in AVSP Zone D. (City Council Resolution No. 17-1838.) In Zone D, the AVSP specifies 24 front setbacks of 10 feet (minimum) and 20 feet (maximum), side setbacks of 0 feet (minimum) and
25 20 feet (maximum), and rear setbacks of 0 feet (minimum). The approved site plan for the Cornerstone project clearly showed that the project would not meet the minimum and maximum
26 front setback requirements along Cornell and Agoura Roads.

27 4 This about-face is patently inconsistent with the policies of the AVSP. The Specific Plan calls

28 for creating a "walkable, vibrant plan" and a "welcoming pedestrian friendly atmosphere" that will

1947567.3 -11-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 45. This changing position is inconsistent with the vesting protection afforded by the
2 Subdivision Map Act, under which an application is subject only to the ordinances, policies, and
3 standards in effect at the time the application was deemed complete. Cal. Gov. Code §§

4 66498.1(b), 66474.2. The vesting tentative map statute requires prior actual or constructive notice

5 as a condition to imposing ordinances, policies, and standards upon an applicant who is entitled to
6 rely on complete vesting tentative map.

7 46. Moreover, the Project's site plan was designed specifically to be consistent with the

8 concept and massing diagram for the Project site shown on Page 5-72 of the AVSP. This is the site
9 plan the City desires along the Agoura Road frontage-yet the AVSP concept plan itself would
10 not be consistent with the AVSP's setback requirements. For example, the AVSP standards
11 provide that the maximum side yard setback for non-residential and mixed-use buildings is 10 feet
12 from the property line. (AVSP, at p. 4-50.) However, to provide the public plaza at the corner of

13 Kanan and Agoura Roads as shown in the concept plan and that City policymakers (including the
14 LU/EDC) desired, some buildings must necessarily have side setbacks greater than 10 feet. It was
15 physically impossible to design a project that is consistent with the concept diagram, the
16 LU/EDC's direction to "work with City staff' to "further "open up" the space," and the setback
17 requirements.

18 47. Still, going along with the City, CCI's experts spent countless hours studying staff's
19 revised interpretation and concluded that it was completely unfeasible to comply with the Specific
20 Plan's minimum and maximum setback requirements while also conforming to the maximum
21 building area development standard. In fact, the only way for the Project site plan to legally comply
22 with all the setback requirements would be to jerry-rig an unworkable and un-financeable
23 subdivision map, with no basis in good real estate or land use practice.

24 48. Even so, the City staff informed CCI that if CCI tried to revise its map to achieve

25

26 "encourage pedestrian orientation and movement throughout the area." (AVSP, at pp. 1-10, 1-7, 27 and 1-12.) As staff acknowledged in the January 30, 2017 letter, the Project's site plan and

28 setbacks would be "beneficial" in supporting this pedestrian-oriented atmosphere.

1947567.3 -12-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

conformance (convoluted lot lines and all) would forfeit CCI's legal "vested" status and rights as

2 of the deemed complete date on September 25, 2018, which would have started the entire seven-
3  year application process over again.

49. An ordinance, policy, or standard must be sufficiently detailed to provide the

5 applicant with reasonable notice of the actual, discernible standard that will apply to the developer's

6 project. Here, as discussed above, the AVSP specifically contemplates flexible development
7 standards. In communications prior to when the Project applications were deemed complete, CCI

8 had actual notice of the City's policy interpretation that the Project's proposed setbacks were
9 "beneficial" and could be accommodated through the AVDP process. And, CCI had no notice,
10 actual or constructive, that the AVSP's setback standards were considered inconsistent or not open

11 to flexibility. Therefore, the Project setbacks' ability to be accommodated through the AVDP
12 process applied as of the deemed complete date on September 25, 2018.

13 50. The City's historically unstable, but now immovable, position on setbacks can only
14 be read as an effort to strong-arm CCI into relinquishing its vested rights under the Subdivision
15 Map Act as of the "deemed complete" date. As discussed below, the City's real motivation is to is
16 clear the Project site of any pending applications, so that it can continue to target the Project site
17 for a large share of the City's affordable housing needs in its Housing Element while maintaining
18 its de facto development moratorium.

19 2. Building Height

20 51. The second stated basis for denying the Project was the supposed inconsistency
21 with the AVSP development standards regarding building height.

22 52. The AVSP provides that building height is measured "using the maximum vertical
23 height of a building or structure at all points measured from natural grade." (AVSP, at p. 4-44.)
24 In all other areas of the City, the height of a structure is "measured vertically from the finished
25 grade." Agoura Hills Municipal Code § 9607.

26 53. The AVSP also provides, "[b]Juildings that exceed the maximum height adopted
27 within the Specific Plan area may be authorized on the recommendation of the Planning
28 Commission and approval of the City Council through the AVDP process." (AVSP, at p. 4-44.)

1947567.3 -13-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

Chapter 9 of the AVSP sets forth a series of additional findings for the City to approve a height

2 exceedance.

54. CCI proposed to calculate building heights based on finished grade, as is the case
4 everywhere else in the City, rather than natural grade. Measured from natural grade, some of the
buildings would have exceeded the Specific Plan's height maximums, in some cases by de
6 minimis amounts. For these buildings, the City should have at least given the City decision-
7 makers the opportunity to allow for flexibility as the AVDP process expressly contemplates, and,

8 thus, the City did not proceed in accordance with the AVSP.
9 55. CCI has always proposed to measure the Project's building heights from finished
10 grade, rather than natural grade. CCI had years of back-and-forth discussions with staff about this
11 both during the concept review and formal application stages. CCI believed it had long ago-
12 prior to the "deemed complete" letter--reached a consensus with the City about the building
13 heights, consistent with the AVSP's intended procedures and flexible development standards.

14 56. In December 2019, CCI asked if the City needed any additional information related
15 to the findings necessary to approve the exceptions to the maximum building height. (December
16 11, 2019 Letter from CCI to Assistant Planning Director.) And, just last year, Planning staff
17 proposed 12 planning principles to the City Council for updating the AVSP, one of which was to
18 make the exact change to building height measurement that the Project proposed.

19 57. However, the City ignored this history in suddenly moving to deny the Project
20 based on allegedly non-compliant building heights. Given that the AVSP expressly contemplates

21 that the City can approve buildings that exceed the specified maximums, the City abused its
22 discretion and did not proceed in accordance with the AVSP by denying the Project on this basis,
23 without even giving the Commission the possibility of approving, or conditionally approving, the
24 proposed building heights.

25 58. The AVSP's expressly contemplated flexibility regarding building heights, means
26 that the City's decision did not proceed in accordance with the AVSP and its findings were not
27 supported by substantial evidence.

28 59. What is more, during the Planning Commission hearing on July 15, 2021, some of

1947567.3 -14-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 the building heights in the staff report that were presented were not correct. Indeed, the staff report
2 and the Planning Commission's findings for denial were based on out-of-date information, and were,

3 therefore, not supported by substantial evidence. Among other things, the staff report alleged that, in
4  part, two buildings that were positioned in an area that could obscure scenic views, including of

5 Ladyface Mountain, would be over-height if measured from natural grade as opposed to finished
6 grade.

7 60. However, the building heights in the staff report were not correct. The correct
8 Project data showed that the most sensitive buildings along the Project site perimeter that were the
9 focus of the Planning Commission's denial findings would meet the AVSP height limit, even if
10 measured from natural grade. The correct Project data showed that the Project would result in less
11 overall view blockage along the majority of the Agoura/Kanan frontage if the proposed heights
12 were measured from finished grade. And, under either measurement, the key buildings still
13 complied with the AVSP. Thus, the alleged basis for denial was substantively a non-issue, and the
14 staff report's statement at the July hearing that "[t]he buildings, particularly for those with
15 locations close to the public rights-of-way, would partially obscure views to the Santa Monica
16 Mountains, particularly Ladyface Mountain, which would not be consistent with the Plan's
17 policies to maintain view sheds" was plainly erroneous. (Planning Commission Staff Report, at p.
18 13.)

19 61. The City should have immediately corrected the errors in the Planning Commission
20 staff report regarding the heights for the key buildings on the Kanan and Agoura Road frontages

21 and allowed the Project to move forward in the ordinary course and given the Commission an
22 opportunity to make the AVDP findings for the other height exceedances. Instead, staff engineered

23 a scenario in which the Commission's only option was to deny the Project based on erroneous
24 building height information.

25 62. The City Council staff report at the September City Council hearing attempted to
26 correct the record, abandoning the argument that these two buildings were over-height. (City
27 Council Staff Report, at pp. 1-2.) However, in admitting this error, the City's entire substantive
28 basis for denial based on building heights also disappeared. The City's allegation was that the key

1 buildings on the Kanan and Agoura Road frontages would block views of Ladyface Mountain

2 from the public rights-of-way. The remaining over-height buildings, though later highlighted in
3 the City Council staff report, were an after-thought at the Planning Commission hearing, and there
was no evidence in the record that they would have a substantive impact on alleged view

5 blockages.

6 63. The City Council staff report in September also stated that the City Council cannot
7 approve flexible building heights for the remaining over-height buildings, because the Planning

8 Commission "did not recommend approval of the project, including the flexibility for height
9 standards." (City Council Staff Report, at p. 15.) Yet this fails to acknowledge that the critical
10 factual errors in the Planning Commission's decision itself.

11 64. Still, the City's logic was, yes, it offered incorrect information on two buildings'
12 heights in the July hearing, but a few other buildings were still noncompliant with the standards
13 and the Planning Commission did not grant flexibility for those, so denial was still warranted.
14 However, this is faulty logic as well because the Planning Commission could have come to a
15 different result if it considered the true height of all buildings in question and the impact on the
16 scenic views at issue.

17 3. Number of Vertical Mixed-Use Residential Units

18 65. The third stated basis for denying the Project was the supposed inconsistency with
19 the AVSP development standards regarding vertical mixed-use residential units.
20 66. The denial of the Project by the City partly was because the Project design
21 provided 42 vertical mixed-use residential units, whereas the Specific Plan would only allow a
22 maximum of 37 vertical mixed-use units in the Project.

23 67. City staff only informed CCI about this issue in June 2021, seven years into Project
24 processing and nearly three years after the Project applications were legally deemed complete.
25 Amazingly, the applicant was first informed of this noncompliance during telephone call with
26 City staff on June 17, 2021, when it was also informed that a hearing would be scheduled
27 imminently before the Planning Commission to summarily deny the Project. CCI could have
28 easily adjusted the Project plans to comply with this development standard. However, City staff

1947567.3 -16-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 never provided or allowed CCI an opportunity to resolve this issue. Rather, the City moved

2 straight to denying the Project, using newfound noncompliance with this Specific Plan standard as

3 a useful pretext.

4 68. It was bad faith and an abuse of discretion for the City to deny the Project based on
5 the number of vertical mixed-use units without giving CCI any opportunity to adjust the plans.
6 The City should have allowed the Project to move forward in the ordinary course, where Project

7 design adjustments are part of the normal process. The City abused its discretion by not giving

8 CCI any opportunity to cure this easily resolvable issue.

q 4. Roundabout

10 69. Additionally, the City's treatment of the proposed intersection of Kanan and
11 Agoura Roads is a further example of the City's bad faith and abuse of discretion. The adopted
12 AVSP contemplates a roundabout at this intersection. As far back as September 10, 2014,
13 however, the Council explicitly directed staff to amend the AVSP to include a traditional,
14 signalized traffic intersection instead of the roundabout. (September 23, 2014 Report to City
15 Council and Planning Commission from City Manager re: Agoura Village Specific Plan Study
16 Session.) Consistent with the Council's direction, the Project plans and certain CEQA documents
17 and EIR technical reports contemplate traditional intersection. For example, the Project's Initial
18 Study from October 2018 states that "[a] previously proposed conversion of the Kanan Road and
19 Agoura a Road intersection into a roundabout would not be part of this project, and is no longer
20 anticipated to be implemented as part of the AVSP." (The AVE Project Initial Study, October 17,
21 2018, at p. 38.)

22 70. Yet, staff never brought forward the necessary amendment to the Specific Plan as
23 directed by the City Council. In any event, the type of intersection is a material issue. In an e-
24 mail to CCI, the Assistant Planning Director stated:

25 [I]n its current configuration, the AVE can accommodate either the roundabout

26 currently identified in the AVSP or the proposed intersection. City staff is not
proposing to deny the pending application based on the intersection and therefore
27 does not believe it is relevant to the issues that will be presented to the Planning Commission at the hearing.
28

1947567.3 -17-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 (June 30, 2021 e-Mail from Assistant Planning Director to CCI.)

2 71. These assertions are not correct: the intersection design materially impacts the
3 Project's circulation, site planning and environmental review. Specifically, conformance with a

4 roundabout designed intersection would require a large land dedication on the Project site and
significantly alter the proposed site plan and building arrangement. CCI has followed the City

6 Council's explicit direction, but staff failed for nearly seven years to bring forward amendments to
7 the AVSP to make it consistent with the City's preferred circulation plan and the Project's
8 longstanding design.

9 F. The City Violated State Housing Element Law

10 72. While the City's inconsistent actions regarding the setbacks, building heights,
11  vertical mixed-use residential units and the roundabout appear odd, the procedural gymnastics
12 employed by the City to ensure a snap denial of the Project, can only be understood in the context
13 of the pending Housing Element update.

14 73. The State Housing Element Law requires the City to conform its land use actions to
15 | its Housing Element. (See Gov. Code § 65587(c) ("If a court finds that an action of a city, county,

16 or city and county, which is required to be consistent with its general plan, does not comply with
17| its housing element, the city, county, or city and county shall bring its action into compliance

18 within 60 days.")). Agoura Hills current Housing Element ranges from 2013-2021, and the 2021-
19 2029 Housing Element is currently being prepared by the City at this time.
20 74. The great majority of the City's Regional Housing Needs Assessment (*RHNA")
21 affordable housing allocation is proposed to be developed in the AVSP. However, because of the
22 Project's deemed complete status, the Project's housing component was not legally required to
23 include on-site affordable units (although a sizable in lieu fee payment would be made to the
24 City's affordable housing trust fund).

25 75. Under Government Code Section 65863(c)(2), if approval of a development project
26 results in fewer units by income category than are identified in the Housing Element for that
27 parcel, and the remaining sites identified in the Housing Element are inadequate to accommodate
28 the City's RHNA obligations, the City must identify and make available additional sites to

1947567.3 -18-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 accommodate the RHNA obligations within 180 days. This section then immediately makes clear,

2 "[n]othing in this section shall authorize a city, county, or a city and county to disapprove a housing
3 development project on the basis that approval of the housing project would require compliance

4 with this paragraph." Gov. Code § 65863(c)(2).

5 76. Thus, it is no surprise that City would obfuscate the real reasons for the City's
6 denial of the Project. If the City disclosed the obvious - that the real basis for Project denial is that
7 the CCI enjoyed vested rights that did not require the provision of affordable housing, the City

8 would walk right into a Housing Element violation.

9 77. Indeed, at the Planning Commission hearing on July 15, 2021 - with the life of the
10 Project in balance - a Planning Commission member asked whether the Project would satisfy any
11 of the 318 units needed for the City's upcoming RHNA cycle. To which the City staff member

12 stated no and that, as the Project stood and if approved, it would not help satisfy any RHNA
13 requirements for the City apart from the "Above Moderate" category, but then the City staff
14 member clarified that the City does not have trouble meeting that category. This question was
15 followed up minutes later by another Planning Commission member who sought from City staff
16 the exact RHNA numbers for the Project. Later that night, CCI's representative was asked by two
17 different commissioners about the lack of low-incoming housing provided by the Project. At the
18 conclusion of the hearing, City staff was again asked about the RHNA requirements, to which the
19 staff explained that all City's Housing Element efforts are concentrating on finding housing for the
20 lower income housing - which the Project did not provide.

21 78. Moreover, at the September 8, 2021 City Council meeting where the Project was
22 denied by the City Council, the immediate next agenda item was "a Public Hearing Regarding the
23 Sixth Cycle Housing Element 2021-2029 - Update of Identification of Potential Housing Sites
24 and Actions to Meet the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA)." During this presentation
25 by the City staff, the Project site was specifically and expressly identified in a PowerPoint
26| presentation to the City Council - now that the Project was denied - as the first potential site to
27 help Agoura Hills reach its RHNA goals. The fact the City had prepared documents identifying
28 the Project site as a key location for affordable housing before the City Council ever acted on the

1947567.3 -19-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

appeal clearly shows that the City was not acting objectively as required by law.

2 79. Denying CCI's Project and striping CCI of its vested rights, due to the RHNA
3 requirements was an illegitimate basis to deny the Project and a violation of Government Code
4 Section 65863(c)(2). As discussed above, the City abused its discretion and resorted to extreme

5 and outrageous conduct to derail the Project.

6 G. The City Has : Pattern and Practice of Imposing a De facto Moratorium on

7 Housing and Development

8 80. As noted above, it is through no fault of CCI that the City has become so deficient
9 in meeting its RHNA obligations. Nor is CCI the only victim of the City's draconian processing
10 practices. Rather, the City's conduct with respect to the Project is part of its years-long pattern and
11 practice of imposing a de facto moratorium on housing and development in the City through
12 excessive process, which violates the Housing Crisis Act of 2019 and harms both CCI and other
13 members of the public.

14 81. The Housing Crisis Act of 2019 applies to all "affected cities," including Agoura
15 Hills. With respect to land where housing is an allowable use, the City may not "enact a
16 development policy, standard or condition" that would have the effect of "[i]mposing a
17 moratorium or similar restriction or limitation on housing development, including mixed-use
18 development, within all or a portion of"' the City, except to specifically protect against an
19 imminent threat to health and safety. Gov. Code § 66300(b)(1)(B).

20 82. Over the past years, and specifically within the last few years prior to the date the
21 City decided to snap deny the Project in June 2021 despite the Project being deemed complete in
22 2018, the City has tacitly carried out development policies and conditions that impose a de facto
23 moratorium on development. The City intentionally engages in practices such as changing its
24 interpretations of development standards and making endless, iterative, and unreasonable demands
25 from applicants.

26 83. Just one illustrative example is the City's treatment of the Project's archeological
27 resources technical report. It took well over a year to approve the plan for on-site testing
28 associated with the report, with constant back-and-forth deliberations between CCI's consultant

1947567.3 -20-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

and City staff. Then, it took the City another eight months to complete its Tribal Cultural
2 Resources consultations. Once the City finally gave CCI approval to move forward with the
3 analysis, it took another six months for a the City to issue a simple temporary fencing permit to
4  ensure public safety during the on-site testing.

5 84. In addition, as discussed above, the City required CCI to spend hundreds of
6 thousands of dollars to complete an EIR over the years. Then once the EIR was "nearly complete"
7 in the spring of 2021, the City refused to complete the EIR, rushed to a hearing and requested a

8 denial where the applicant and the public was denied the benefit of the objective environmental
9 work that had been performed by the City's consultant over the course of many years.

10 85. The AVSP is the one area of the City where the City Council has adopted a plan
11 that specifically calls for development. Yet, the City's policies with respect to processing
12 development projects demonstrate a tacit, but very deliberate, "slow-growth" / "no-growth" master
13 strategy to ensure that nothing is ever built. These shifting interpretations include, but are not
14 limited to, refusing to be flexible and compliant with the AVSP, changing positions in with regard
15 as to how the City views the setback standard in the AVSP from project to project and within the
16 same project, refusing to address the key issue of the roundabout for years and years, requiring 11
17 different planning submittals after the deemed complete date in 2018 (four within 2020 alone), and
18 noncompliance with CEQA. These policies have imposed a de facto moratorium on critical land
19 that is available for residential use, which violates the Housing Crisis Act. The City's decades-
20 long pattern and practice of failing to process housing projects in the ordinary course is a
21 dereliction of its essential public duties that harms both CCI and other members of the public.

22 H. CCI's Damages

23 86. CCI has spent millions of dollars in direct reliance on the City's continued good
24 faith preparation of the EIR and processing of the Project. In addition to these amounts paid
25 directly to the City and the City's consultants, CCI's total direct project expenses exceed millions,
26 including expenses attributable to EIR-related costs, expenses for architecture, landscape
27 architecture, civil engineering, traffic engineering, archeological consulting, environmental
28 consulting, and geotechnical engineering. This is in addition to the estimated 25,000 or more hours

1947567.3 -21-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

:
--

1 that CCI's direct team has spent on the Project-not including any third-party consultant time.

P 2 87. CCI has already incurred significant quantifiable monetary damages due to, in part,

-a detrimental reliance on the City's past conduct and the City's failure to finish the EIR and process

4 the Project in the ordinary course with the possibility of approval.

5 88. CCI has also suffered substantial damages in the millions caused by the City's
6 action in the form of lost profits and lost opportunity in developing the Property.

7 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

8 (Code Civ. Proc., § 1085; § 1094.5; Violation of CEQA, Pub. Res. Code 21000 et seq.)

9 (Against All Respondents)

10 89. CCI hereby incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs of this Petition as
11 though fully set forth herein.

12 90. CEQA, codified at Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq., sets forth a
13 process which a public agency is required to follow in evaluating the effect of a proposed action
14 on the environment. CEQA requires public agencies to consider the environmental impacts of
15 proposed projects and to mitigate or avoid significant impacts, if feasible. Pub. Res. Code,
16 § 21002. As part of that a process, a public agency must prepare, or cause to be prepared, and
17 certify the completion of an EIR for any project that it proposes to carry out or approve that may

18 have a significant effect on the environment. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21100, subd. (a), 21151, subd.
--1• L-s 19 (a). Public Resources Code section 21151.5 provides time limits for preparation of an EIR or
20 negative declaration, directing that "(a) ... each local agency shall establish by ordinance or
21 resolution, time limits that do not exceed the following: [11 (A) One year for completing and
22 certifying environmental impact reports." CEQA has an exemption to the EIR requirement for
23 "Ip]rojects which a public agency rejects or disapproves." Pub. Res. Code § 21080, subd. (b)(5).
24 The purpose of this exemption is to provide for the "initial screening of projects on the merits for
25 quick disapprovals prior to the initiation [o]f the CEQA process where the agency can determine
26 that the project cannot be approved." Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14 § 15270, subd. (b). The public
27 policy behind this CEQA exemption is that "public agencies should not be forced to commit their
28 resources to the costly and time-consuming environmental review process for proposed private
173 5'- 1947567.3 -22-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 development projects slated for rejection." Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster v. State Water
2 Resources Control Bd. (1993) 12 Cal. App. 4th 1371, 1384.

3 91. Respondents abused the CEQA process by failing to complete the EIR and instead
4 invoking a CEQA statutory exemption for denial that operates to screen out projects in the early

5 stages, before significant resources are expended. Here, the draft EIR was in the late stages of
6 preparation for publication for public comment and had already been fully funded by CCI before

7 the Respondents deliberately cut off the EIR process to pre-ordain the outcome. The City further
8 failed to meet a one-year deadline to complete and certify the EIR under Public Resources Code
Section 21151.5 after the Project had been deemed complete.

10 92. Respondents' actions were arbitrary, capricious and lacking in evidentiary support.
11 CCI's fundamental vested rights are involved and the court is authorized by law to exercise its
12 independent judgment on the evidence.

13 93. Respondents abused their discretion by not proceeding in a manner by law, and
14 their underlying decisions and determinations are not supported by substantial evidence.
15| Respondents' actions are not supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record.
16 Pub. Res. Code § 21168 et seq.

17 94. CCI is entitled to seek any and all forms of relief, including a writ of mandate to

18 remedy each failure by Respondents to comply with CEQA.

19 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (Code Civ. Proc., § 1085; § 1094.5; Violation of the Housing Element Law)

21 (Against All Respondents)

22 95. CCI hereby incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs of this Petition as
23 though fully set forth herein.

24 96. The City failed to implement the Housing Element when it denied CCI's Project. The
25 City's current Housing Element states the AVSP relieves governmental constraints on housing
26 caused by City processing and permit procedures. Respondents did not comply with one of the
27 Housing Element goals to "[p]rovide flexibility in development standards," (2013-2021 Housing
28 Element, at p. V-13). Respondents did not offer an "unique review process to enhance development

1947567.3 -23-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

r

flexibility and innovation." (Id. at p. III-18.) Respondents did not comply with the Housing
2 Element's statement that in the AVSP "[bJuilding setbacks are minimal to create t vibrant, walkable
3 village environment" and that the AVSP development standards provide for "minimal setback

4 requirements." (Id. at pp.

5 III-4 and IV-6.) The Respondents did not comply with the Housing

6 Element where it provides that "[t]he City's policy is to work with applicants early on in the process
to expedite processing of applications within the Agoura Village Specific Plan, with a goal of
7 completing concept review through entitlement approval within one year." (Id. at p. III-18.)

8 97. In addition, under Government Code Section 65863(c)(2), if approval of a
9 development project results in fewer units by income category than are identified in the Housing

: 10 Element for that parcel, and the remaining sites identified in the Housing Element are inadequate
11 to accommodate the City's RHNA obligations, the City must identify and make available
12 additional sites to accommodate the RHNA obligations within 180 days. However, this section
13 makes clear, "[n]othing in this section shall authorize a city, county, or city and county to
14 disapprove a housing development project on the basis that approval of the housing project would
15 require compliance with this paragraph." Gov. Code § 65863(c)(2). The City based its denial on a
16 series of pretextual claims (i.e., Specific Plan non-compliance), but the real reason was likely for

: 17 the denial was that approving the project would have resulted in a RHNA deficiency for the City.

18

19 Thus, the City violated Government Code Section 65863(c)(2) when it denied the Project.

98. Respondents' actions were arbitrary, capricious and lacking in evidentiary support.

- -% 20 CCI's fundamental vested rights are involved and the court is authorized by law to exercise its
21 independent judgment on the evidence.

22 99. Respondents abused their discretion by not proceeding in a manner by law, and
23 their underlying decisions and determinations are not supported by substantial evidence.
24 Respondents' actions are not supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record.

25 100. CCI is entitled to seek any and all forms of relief, including a writ of mandate to
26 remedy each failure by Respondents to comply with the Housing Element.

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Code Civ. Proc., § 1085; 1094.5; Violation of the Subdivision Map Act)

3 (Against All Respondents)

4 101. CCI hereby incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs of this Petition as
5 though fully set forth herein.

6 102. Respondents violated the Subdivision Map Act. The City's changing position as it
7 relates to the reasoning for the denial of the Project was inconsistent with the vesting protection
8 afforded by the Subdivision Map Act, under which an application is subject only to the
9 ordinances, policies, and standards in effect at the time the application was deemed complete. Cal.
10 Gov. Code §§ 66498.1(b), 66474.2. CCI should have been able to rely upon its deemed complete
11 vesting tentative map prior to expending resources and incurring liabilities without the risk of
12 having the Project frustrated by subsequent action from the City. The City identified two of the
13 City's three stated bases for denying the Project, building setbacks and the permitted number of
14 vertical mixed-use residential units, after the AVDP and VTTM applications were officially
15 deemed complete. The City, without fair warning, ignored and violated the most important benefit
16 of a vesting tentative map, which is to evaluate, review and consider the application based on the
17 rules ordinances, policies, and standards in place at the time the map application was deemed
18 complete.

19 103. Respondents' actions were arbitrary, capricious and lacking in evidentiary support.
20 CCI's fundamental vested rights are involved and the court is authorized by is law to exercise its
21 independent judgment on the evidence.

22 104. Respondents abused their discretion by not proceeding in a manner by law, and
23 their underlying decisions and determinations are not supported by substantial evidence.
24 Respondents' actions are not supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record.

25 105. CCI is entitled to seek any and all forms of relief, including a writ of mandate to

3 (Against All Respondents)

4 106. CCI hereby incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs of this Petition as
5 though fully set forth herein.

107. The Housing Crisis Act of 2019 applies to Agoura Hills, and it requires that the
7 City not "enact a development policy, standard or condition" that would have the effect of
8 "[i]mposing a moratorium or similar restriction or limitation on housing development, including
mixed-use development, within all or a portion of' the City, except to specifically protect against
10 an imminent threat to health and safety. Gov. Code § 66300(b)(1)(B). The City, however, has
11 tacitly carried out development policies and conditions that impose a de facto moratorium on
12 development. As discussed above, the City intentionally engages in practices such as changing its
13 interpretations of development standards, making endless, iterative, and unreasonable demands
14 from applicants and rendering a land use determination completely at odds with its own Housing
15 Element, the AVSP, the Subdivision Map Act and CEQA.

16 108. Respondents' actions were arbitrary, capricious and lacking in evidentiary support.
17 CCI's fundamental vested rights are involved and the court is authorized by law to exercise its

19 109. Respondents abused their discretion by not proceeding in manner by law, and
20 their underlying decisions and determinations are not supported by substantial evidence.
21 Respondents' actions are not supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record.

28 as though fully set forth herein.

1947567.3 -26-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

112. Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, subdivision (a) provides that a writ of
2 mandate "may be issued by any court to any inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person; to
3 compel the performance of an act which the law specially enjoins, as a duty resulting from an

4 office, trust, or station, or to compel the admission of a party to the use and enjoyment of a right or

5 office to which the party is entitled, and from which the party is unlawfully precluded by that
6 inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person."

7 113. The City's denial of the Project was arbitrary, capricious and lacking in evidentiary
8 support. CCI's fundamental vested rights are involved and the court is authorized by law to
9 exercise its independent judgment on the evidence. The totality of the City's endless processing,
10 combined with its misuse of the CEQA exemption to force the Planning Commission into a snap
11 denial, had no rational relationship to the City's stated reasons for denying the Project. The snap
12 denial failed to allow CCI to propose an alternative project in the EIR that met the identified
13 "deficiencies" of the Project, even though CCI did submit plans for the EIR alternative as part of
14| its objection letter to the City Council in September to provide evidence that it was actually
15 working on the plan in good faith (despite staff's allegations to the contrary). The City's denial of
16 the Project, based on changed rules and policies that occurred after the vesting map deemed
17 complete date, was inconsistent with the vesting protection afforded by the Subdivision Map Act.
18 The City violated its own Housing Element by completely ignoring critical housing production
19 goals that include working flexibly with CCI (a housing applicant in the AVSP) and, instead,
20 implementing a tortured seven-year plus application process in lieu of the promised one-year
21 entitlement effort. In addition, the denial was based on pretextual reasoning, but in fact, the denial
22 likely occurred because the City's RHNA deficiency concerns. These above practices by the City
23 have imposed a de facto moratorium on development. Several of the City's actions were in direct
24 violation of Gov. Code Section 65000 et seq.

25 114. CCI is entitled to seek any and all forms of relief, including a writ of mandate and
26 injunctive relief pending the judgment of the court.

5 as though fully set forth herein.

6 116. Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, subdivision (a) provides for the issuance
7 of a writ of mandate "[w]here the writ is issued for the purpose of inquiring into the validity of any

18 discretion. Respondents' decision to deny the Project is not supported by the findings, and the
19 findings are not supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record. § 1094.5, subd.
20 |(b). The City ignored the provisions of the AVSP, the Planning Commission findings do not

21 support its decision to deny the Project and the findings were not supported by substantial
22 evidence. The City's actions left no opportunity for meaningful public participation, actual due
23 process, or a fair and impartial hearing on the merits. Respondents improperly put the denial on a

24 fast-track, which deprived CCI a of its rights to a full and fair evidentiary hearing. The City's denial
25 of the Project was inconsistent with the Subdivision Map Act's vesting protections. The City did
26 not comply with its Housing Element. The City did not comply with its Housing Element. The
27 City improperly denied the Project based on pretextual reasoning, but in fact it was based on

28

1947567.3 -28-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

RHNA deficiencies. The City's actions amount to a de facto moratorium on development. Several

2 of the City's actions were in direct violation of Gov. Code Section 65000 et seq.

3 118. CCI's fundamental vested rights are involved and the court is authorized by law to

4 exercise its independent judgment on the evidence. In the alternative, Respondents' decision to

5 deny the AVE Project is not supported by the weight of the evidence. Respondents' findings are
6 not supported by substantial evidence in the light of the whole record.

7 119. CCI is entitled to seek any and all forms of relief, including damages, a writ of
8 mandate and injunctive relief pending the judgment of the court.

0 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Violation of the California Public Records Act)

11 (Against All Respondents)

12 120. CCI hereby incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint
13 as though fully set forth herein.

14 121. Pursuant to the California Public Records Act (*PRA") codified at Gov. Code
15 section 6250 et seq., CCI submitted a PRA request to the City on June 28, 2021 and an amended
16 PRA request on July 2, 2021 (collectively "the PRA Requests"). The PRA Requests included a
17 request for the administrative draft EIR. The City improperly withheld the administrative draft
18 EIR from CCI.

19 122. The City's decision to refuse disclosure was not justified, and the City should be
20 ordered to make the record public.

21 123. CCI seeks injunctive relief, declarative relief and/or a peremptory or alternative
22 writ of mandate. CCI further seeks costs and reasonable attorney fees pursuant to Gov. Code

23 § 6259(d).

EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of Due Process)

3 (Against All Respondents)

4 124. CCI hereby incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint
as though fully set forth herein.
6 125. The City unlawfully, wrongfully, and improperly further violated CCI's Fourteenth
7 Amendment Due Process and Article I, § 7(a) of the California Constitution rights by performing
8 unlawful, wrongful and improper acts against CCI.
9 126. The City's acts and omissions, as set forth above and below, constitute arbitrary,
10 capricious, irrational and abusive conduct which unlawfully interfered with CCI's property
11 interests, including vested rights in the Project, protected by due process.
12 127. The City has acted under color of state law with the intent to unlawfully deprive
13 CCI of full use and deriving reasonable investment-backed revenue from the Property without due
14 process.
15 128. The City's tactics regarding the Project's applications and CEQA review reveal a
16 deliberate attempt to delay, constantly shift the terrain and move the goalposts, such that CCI
17 could never be on firm footing to move forward with public hearings on the Project in the ordinary
18 course, absent the inappropriate denial. The City arbitrarily moved to deny the Project after more
19 than seven years of work, and millions of dollars spent, even though CCI had vested rights and
20 continued to work with the City in good faith to resolve the open issues that can be readily
21 resolved. The City manipulated the application review process and CEQA processes to
22 deliberately engineer a situation a in which the only option was to deny the Project without either an
23 adequate or a legal basis.
24 129. Aside from the newly raised de minimis issue regarding the permitted number of
25 vertical mixed-use units, the Project's purported inconsistencies have been part of the Project
26 design and known to the City for years. Yet, the City continued to process the Project and EIR
27

28

1947567.3 -30-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

for years, taking advantage of CCI's good faith as it continued to it pay the City's (and EIR
2 consultants') invoices.

130. Then, on the eve of completing the draft EIR, the City suddenly moved to deny the

4 Project, leaving the decision-makers no other options but to deny the Project without the aid of a
5 completed EIR to review. Ordinarily, decision-makers are presented with a menu of options; if a
6 they have concerns regarding a project before them, they can conditionally approve the project.
7 Here, the City deliberately cut off the EIR process to pre-ordain the outcome.

8 131. These actions left no opportunity for meaningful public participation, actual due
9 process, or a fair and impartial hearing on the merits at a meaningful time and in a meaningful
10 manner. CCI was legitimately entitled to a fair and complete review of its vested, complete project
11 application, which the City denied. The City's abuse of the CEQA exemption and the land use
12 and CEQA processes violated CCI's due process rights.

13 132. These actions are part of a pattern, practice, and custom of the City essentially
14  imposing a de facto moratorium on any development in the City that harms both CCI and the
15 public.

16 133. As a direct and proximate result of the City's acts and omissions, which resulted in
17 deprivation of both CCI's due process rights, CCI has and will continue to sustain monetary
18 damages including lost revenue, profits, expenses, attorneys' fees, and other costs incurred.

19 134. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, CCI is entitled to declaratory relief and
20 temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief.

21 135. CCI found it necessary to engage the services of private legal counsel to vindicate
22 his rights under the law. CCI is therefore entitled to an award of reasonable attorney's fees and
23 costs pursuant to 42. U.S.C. § 1988.

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Inverse Condemnation and Violation of Takings Clause)
3 (Against All Respondents)
4
136. CCI hereby incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint
5

6 as though fully set forth herein.

137. Article I, § 19 of the California Constitution provides that "Private Property may be
7 taken or damaged for public use only when just compensation, ascertained by a jury unless
8
waived, has first been paid to, or into court, for the owner."
9 138. Under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution, the
10

11 City taking of private property for public use without paying just compensation and depriving CCI
of both substantive and procedural due process is compensable by damages.
12
139. The City is a governmental entity with the capacity to sue and be sued, acting under
13
the color of state law.
14
140.
15 Respondents, acting under color of California law, have caused, and will continue
to cause, CCI, to be deprived of its right to possess, use, and dispose of the Property, without just
16
compensation in violation of (1) Article 1, Section 19 of the California Constitution and of (2) the
17 Takings Clause of the U.S. Constitution per the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.
18
141. The City's extreme and inconsistent processing abuse and serial delays, followed
19

20 by its conduct in suddenly denying the Project, refusing to complete the EIR and removal of CCI's
vested rights, was arbitrary and unreasonable, bears no rational relationship to a legitimate purpose 21 and amounted to a taking under both the United States and the California Constitution. 22
142.
23 Here, the City's repeated stonewalling of development projects at the Project site,

24 shifting interpretations of development standards, and general disregard for the provisions of the
AVSP, have unreasonably impaired the value or use of the Project site. The City's actions rise to 25 the level of "extraordinary delay" constituting a taking. 26
143.
27 The City's interpretations of the AVSP and actions regarding the Project have had a
significant economic impact on CCI, both in terms of direct cost expenditures, as well as the 28

1947567.3 -32-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

H

2 opportunity cost of delay. Moreover, the City has interfered with CCI's distinct investment-

3 backed expectationsreversing course on the Project's setbacks, failing to bring forward a long-

4 directed amendment to the AVSP, and engineering a situation in which there was no possibility
that the decision-makers could approve the Project in the ordinary course. Finally, the City's
5 abusive tactics went beyond ordinary local government delays or procedural errors.

6 144.

7 The City's abuse of the land use and CEQA process to repeatedly delay and deny

8 multiple project applications at the Project site have deprived the Project site of all economically
beneficial use or, at minimum, significantly diminished the economic value of the Project site. The
9 totality of the City's action amount to a regulatory taking of property without just compensation.

10 145. The City also, years after CCI's project was deemed complete, interpreted the
11 AVSP such that a fully compliant project would have removed CCI's vested rights and would
12 have been unfeasible to build at the Project site, giving no options of how to proceed to work
13 around the perceived problem and depriving the Project site (and the citizens of the City) of all
14 economically beneficial use. Therefore, the City's actions must also be considered a per se taking.

15 146.

16 in the Project. The City's actions above also lead to the improper removal of CCI's vested rights

17 147. The City's actions thus constitute a direct, substantial, and peculiar burden on
18 CCI's property interests, while temporarily during the application process, and then permanently
19 after denial, without payment of just compensation.

20 148. These actions are part of a pattern, practice, and custom of the City essentially
21 imposing a de facto moratorium on any development in the City that harms both CCI and the
22 public.

23 149. As a direct and proximate result of City's manifestly unreasonable actions, CCI has
24 suffered injury, loss and damage, including an impermissible burden on the Property during the
25 application process and after the denial, a reduction in value, and the loss of rights in the future to
26 improve and/or develop of the land to its highest and best use, without the benefit of just and fair
27 compensation.

28

1947567.3 -33-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 150. To the extent, the City is justified in taking rights to and in the Property and the

2 rights connected to it, CCI is entitled to just and fair compensation for these takings in fair market
3 value and loss of income. To the extent, the City is not justified in taking rights to and in the

4 property, CCI is entitled to just and fair compensation for the wrongful taking of its property

5 rights.

6 151. •Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, CCI is entitled to declaratory relief and
7 temporary, preliminary, and permanent injunctive relief. it CCI found it necessary to engage the

8 services of private counsel to vindicate their rights under the law. CCI is therefore entitled to an
9 award of attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988.

10 TENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (Equitable Estoppel)

12 (Against All Respondents)

13 152. CCI hereby incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint

14 as though fully set forth herein.

15 153. The City's conduct should be estopped as the City was apprised of it never
16 intended to bring the Project to its conclusion in the ordinary course but CCI was ignorant of these
17 facts, and detrimentally relied on the City's Housing Element and AVSP, the City's interpretations
18 of those documents as of the VTTM deemed complete date, and its belief that the City would
19 apply these regulatory documents in good faith and with fair dealing.

20 154. CCI worked in good faith with the City for years to deem the Project complete,
21 provide all the materials necessary to complete the EIR, and continue to pay all City invoices
22 even the $4,000 budget augmentation requested solely to fund the drafting of the Planning
23 Commission denial letter. At no time until the City suddenly moved to a snap denial of the Project
24 did the City state that it was not continuing to process the Project.

25 155. The City also intended that its conduct would be acted upon. As recently as March
26 2021, it provided an email to CCI confirming that CCI had provided all the technical materials
27 necessary to complete the EIR, but for CCI's final responses to the City's comments on the
28 revised VMT analysis which CCI provided on April 16, 2021. CCI relied on these

1947567.3 -34-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

communications from the City to its detriment. CCI believed that the City was reviewing EIR
2 administrative drafts and moving towards publicly circulating the Draft EIR, and continued to pay
3 City invoices and its own consultants, as it worked to complete the City review process. The
4 denial of the Project on this basis without the possibility of approval significantly harmed CCI,

5

6 given its long-term investment in the Project site.

156.

7 Finally, not only does the injury to CCI's interest exceed the public injury resulting
from estoppel, preventing the City from denying the Project in this manner would benefit the
8 public and prevent a public injury from occurring. No public good would be served by allowing
the City's snap, manufactured denial of the Project to go forward. As discussed above, the City's
10 denial in this manner is part of the City's pattern and practice of imposing a de facto moratorium *

11 on development - particularly multi-family housing. As the City's regulatory documents make gf

12 clear, the City has determined that it is beneficial to concentrate its mandatory growth in the
13 AVSP- including the lion's share of the City's housing obligations. Thus, the City's total
14 blockade on development in the AVSP harms the public at large, ensures that new housing units
15 cannot and will not be built in Agoura Hills, and justifies estoppel against denial of the Project in
16 this manner.

17 157.

19 Under the circumstances here, and given the weight of the cumulative injury to CCI
18 and the public, the City could not have denied the Project in the way it did.

20 ELEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (For Declaratory and Injunctive Relief)

22 158. (Against All Respondents)

23 as though fully set forth herein.

24 159. CCI hereby incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs of this Complaint

An actual controversy has arisen, and now exists, between CCI, on the one hand,
25 and the City and Does 1 through 20, and each of them, on the other, concerning their respective
26 rights and duties laid out in the written documents including, but not limited to, the
27 September 25, 2018 "deemed complete" letter. --.

28

1947567.3 -35-
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

160. CCI desires a judicial determination of the rights and duties of the respective
2 parties, including a determination that the City improperly denied CCI's Project.

3 161. CCI further requests a declaration that the City is and shall be bound by all orders
4 of this Court related to approving the Project and/or reimbursing all of CCI's expenses paid in

5 reliance on the City's representations throughout the course of the Project.

6 162. CCI further requests injunctive relief consistent with the Court's determination and
7 declaration enjoining Respondents from taking further action to prevent the development of the
8 Property. Unless enjoined by the court, Respondents will continue to refuse to certify the EIR and

9 come up with pretextual reasons for denying the Project. Injunctive relief is necessary and
10 appropriate to prevent Respondents from violating the CEQA guidelines, the Public Resources
11 Code, the Government Code and CCI's constitutional and state rights. Unless injunctive relief
12 issues, CCI will be irreparably harmed in that it will be unable to develop the Property.

13 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

14 WHEREFORE, Petitioner/Plaintiff prays for judgment against Respondents/Defendants as

15 follows:

16 1. On the first cause of action, a writ of mandate or peremptory writ issued under the
17 seal of this Court directing Respondents to complete and certify the final EIR and process the
18 applications, which includes publication of the draft EIR;

19 2. On the second cause of action, a writ of mandate or peremptory writ issued under
20 the seal of this Court directing Respondents to set aside the denial of the Project on the grounds

22 compliance with the law;

23 3. On the third cause of action, a writ of mandate or peremptory writ issued under the
24 seal of this Court directing Respondents to set aside the denial of the Project on the grounds that
25 the City has violated the Subdivision Map Act and directing the City to process the Project in
26 compliance with the law;

27 4. On the fourth cause of action, a writ of mandate or peremptory writ issued under
28 the seal of this Court directing Respondents to set aside the denial of the Project on the grounds

2 in compliance with the law;

3 5. On the fifth cause of action, a writ of mandate or peremptory writ issued under the

5 arbitrary, capricious and lacking in evidentiary support;

6 6. On the sixth cause of action, a writ of administrative mandamus issued under the
7 seal of this Court setting aside the denial of the Project as unsupported by substantial evidence and

8 any and all relief pursuant to Code. Civ. Proc. § 1095;

13 9. On the ninth cause of action, an order stating that the City's actions constituted an
14 unlawful taking in violation of the laws of the United States and/or California;

15 10. On the tenth cause of action, a ruling that the City is estopped from denying the
16 Project and refusing to process the Project through the normal course;

17 11. On the eleventh cause of action, a declaratory judgment that: (i) Respondents
18  improperly relied on Pub. Res. Code § 21080, subd. (b)(5), to excuse their failure to prepare,
19 consider and approve or certify an adequate environmental analysis under CEQA; (ii) Respondents
20 failed to comply with Housing Element Law (iii) Respondents violated Gov. Code 65863, subd.
21 (c)(2), by denying the Project on unlawful bases; (iv) Respondent's denial of the Project was
22 inconsistent with the vesting protection afforded by the Subdivision Map Act; (v) Respondents
23 violated Gov. Code § 66300, subd. (b)(1)(B) by creating a de facto moratorium on development
24 due its actions and policies; (vi) the denial of the Project was arbitrary and capricious and
25 constituted : prejudicial abuse of discretion; (vii) Respondents wrongfully withheld the draft EIR;

Re: California Commercial Investment Group, Inc. V. City of Agoura Hills

To Whom It May Concern:

Our offices represent California Commercial Investment Group, Inc. (*CCI') in the above-referenced case pending in the Los Angeles Superior Court. By this letter, we request that respondent City of Agoura Hills (the "City") prepare the record of proceedings in this matter.
We request that respondent prepares whatever record it has, and that it consist of the complete record of the proceedings (formal and informal) to include the administrative record contemplated in Cal. Pub. Res. Code 21167.6.
In compiling the record, respondent should include all materials, including those on which the City did and did not rely on while reviewing CCI's proposed Agoura Village East
Housing and Commercial Mixed Use Development Project (the "Project"). We anticipate that such materials would include, but are not limited to, (a) copies of all input that City received
from staff; (b) all evidence that was contrary to the ultimate decision to reject the Project; and (c)
the following specific materials:
(1) All the Project application materials.
(2) All staff reports and related documents prepared by the respondent with respect to
compliance with the substantive and procedural requirements of The California Environmental
Quality Act ("CEQA") and with respect to the action on the Project.
(3) All staff reports and related documents prepared by the respondent and written testimony or documents submitted by any person relevant to any findings or statement of overriding considerations adopted by the respondent pursuant to CEQA.

(4) Any transcript or minutes of the proceedings at which the decisionmaking body of the
respondent heard testimony on, or considered any environmental document on, the Project, and

any transcript or minutes of proceedings before any advisory body to respondent that were
presented to the decisionmaking body prior to action on the environmental documents or on the
Project.

(5) All notices issued by the respondent to comply with CEQA or with any other law
governing the processing and approval of the Project.
(6) All written comments received in response to, or in connection with, environmental
documents prepared for the Project.
(7) All written evidence or correspondence submitted to, or transferred from, the
respondent with respect to compliance with CEQA or with respect to the Project.
(8) Any proposed decisions or findings submitted to the decisionmaking body of the
respondent by its staff, CCI, or other persons.
(9) The documentation of the final decision regarding the Project.
(10) Any other written materials relevant to the respondent's compliance with this division or to its decision on the merits of the project, including the initial study, any drafts of any environmental document, or portions thereof, that have been released for public review, and copies of studies or other documents relied upon in any environmental document prepared for the Project and either made available to the public during the public review period or included in the
respondent's files on the Project, and all internal agency communications, including staff notes and memoranda related to the Project or to compliance with CEQA.
(11) The full written record before any inferior administrative decisionmaking body whose decision was appealed to a superior administrative decisionmaking body prior to the filing of litigation.
For all electronic recordings, we ask that you provide a typewritten transcript thereof.
If you can provide us with an estimated cost of preparation, we will remit a check to your offices for the estimated amount, subject to our right to seek recovery of record preparation costs if we are deemed to be the prevailing party.
