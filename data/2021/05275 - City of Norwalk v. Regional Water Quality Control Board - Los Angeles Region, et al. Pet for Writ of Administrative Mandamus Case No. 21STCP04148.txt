7 INTRODUCTION AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

8 10.

9 The Petitioner owns and operates portions of the Municipal Separate Storm Sewer
System ("MS4") within its jurisdiction.

10 11.

11 The Petitioner, along with the Counties of Los Angeles and Ventura, the Los

Olt oung 'YON *AMXJ SPROISSOIO 00EEI v Angeles County Flood Control District ("LACFCD"), 84 other incorporated cities within the

13 coastal watersheds of Los Angeles County, the Ventura County Watershed Protection District, and

CASSO & SPARKS, LLP 91746 V *Ánsnpuijo 14 10 incorporated cities within Ventura County, are Permittees (collectively, the "Permittees") under

15 the 2021 MS4 Permit, which purports to regulate the discharge of storm water and urban runoff
from the MS4s within the Los Angeles Basin.
16 12.
3 2021. The final 2021 MS4 Permit was transmitted to Petitioner on or about August 9,

€ 18 13.

19 The 2021 MS4 Permit requires the Petitioner to directly implement its terms within

20 its jurisdictional boundaries, and the Petitioner is, therefore, beneficially interested in the

21 requirements imposed by the 2021 MS4 Permit. Furthermore, by conducting administrative

22 proceedings regarding the 2021 MS4 Permit in a manner which did not comply with applicable

23 federal and State law, as well as the California Constitution and the United States Constitution,

24 Respondents denied Petitioner its rights under such laws. Accordingly, the Petitioner is an

25 aggrieved party and is challenging the actions taken by Respondents and the failures of

26 Respondents to act lawfully in establishing and adopting the 2021 MS4 Permit in accordance with
State and federal law, as more particularly alleged below.
27 14.

28 below: By this action, Petitioner is, among other things and as alleged |n futther detail

PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

- (a) challenging the quasi-legislative and the quasi-adjudicative actions of the

2 Regional Board in adopting the 2021 MS4 Permit without complying with applicable California

3 and federal law;

4 (b) seeking a judicial determination regarding whether the requirements of the

5 2021 MS4 Permit complies with applicable California and federal law and whether certain

6 portions of the 2021 MS4 Permit violate the federal Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq.

7 (*Clean Water Act" or "CWA"), and/or the Porter-Cologne Act and unlawfully impose on

8 Petitioner and other Permittees obligations which are not supported by evidence in the

24 (f) seeking review of the Respondents' quasi-judicial determination of the 2021

25 MS4 Permit and the lack of evidentiary support for the findings in the 2021 MS4 Permit and the

26 Respondents' failure to comply with applicable law, including the California Administrative

27 Procedure Act set forth in Government Code § 11340, et seq. (the "APA"), and failing to afford

28 Petitioner due process under the California and United States Constitutions in the proceedings

5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 relating to the 2021 MS4 Permit; and

2 (g) seeking other writ and related relief.

3 15. This Petition asks that this Court issue a writ of administrative mandamus to both

4 the State Board and the Regional Board and enjoin them from implementing and enforcing those

5 portions of the 2021 MS4 Permit for the following reasons:

6 (a) Respondents acted contrary to law and, specifically, the requirements of the

7 Porter-Cologne Act, the Clean Water Act, and the regulations promulgated thereunder;

8 (b) Respondents' findings in the 2021 MS4 Permit were not supported by

9 substantial evidence, and the requirements and conditions set forth in the 2021 MS4 Permit are not

10 supported by the findings;

11 (c) Respondents failed to comply with the requirements of Porter-Cologne Act,
Water Code § 13000, et seq., and acted contrary to law, as described herein;
13 (d) Respondents' actions in adopting the 2021 MS4 Permit, and in modifying

14 the same, without providing Petitioner sufficient opportunity to review and comment on all

15 S substantive changes prior to the adoption of the 2021 MS4 Permit, as required by law, resulted in

16 Petitioner being denied a full opportunity to review and comment on all such changes and being

& Ansnpuijo 17 denied due process of law, in violation of the United States and California Constitutions; OSSVO á 18 (e) Respondents failed to comply with the requirements of the APA and acted

19 contrary to federal and State law, as described herein, and, among other things, by adopting

20 policies which are generally and universally applied to all operators of MS4 systems within

21 California; and

22 (f) Respondents acted without regard to the requirements and limitations of the

23 Clean Water Act and the federal regulations which the State Board and Regional Board are

24 purporting to implement.

25 A. Petitioner Has Exhausted its Administrative Remedies

26 16. The Regional Board adopted the 2021 MS4 Permit, which required the Counties of

27 Los Angeles and Ventura certain cities located within those counties to implement pollution

28 control measures to reduce the discharge of pollutants from the MS4s to waters of the United

6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

- States. Prior to the issuance of the 2021 MS4 Permit, the Regional Board issued other permits

2 which served as the NPDES permit for the MS4 storm water and non-storm water discharges

3 within the coastal watershed of the County of Los Angeles and applied to the Permittees,

4 including Petitioner.

17. The 2021 MS4 Permit application submitted by the Permittees, including

6 Petitioner, was found by the Regional Board to be complete and in compliance with the Clean

7 Water Act and state law.

8 18. Petitioner or its representatives attended workshops and hearings regarding the

9 draft 2021 MS4 Permit before the Regional Board, and Petitioner also provided written comments

10 and objections to the Regional Board and expressed its concerns regarding the 2021 MS4 Permit

11 prior to its adoption.
Olt dunS 'yLON •ÁMXd SPEOISSOI) OOGR7 dTT'SXHVAS: OSSVO 12 19. The Regional Board adopted the Regional Board Order which served as the basis

13 for the 2021 MS4 Permit on July 23, 2021, as Regional Board Order No. R4-2021-0105 The 2021

14 MS4 Permit purported to become effective on September 11, 2021 and to expire on September 11,

15 2026. Petitioner seeks review of that Regional Board Order and the 2021 MS4 Permit.

16 20. On August 23, 2021, Petitioner timely filed an administrative petition with the
8 9+LI6_VO °Ausnpuijo 17 State Board, pursuant to the § Water Code § 13320, seeking review of the Regional Board Order

18 and the Regional Board's adoption of the 2021 MS4 Permit.

19 21. By letter dated October 21, 2021, the State Board acknowledged receipt of

20 Norwalk's administrative petition. The letter also informed Petitioner that its administrative

21 petition to the State Board would be deemed automatically dismissed without further action by the

22 State Water Board, pursuant to the 23 C.C.R. § 2050.5 of the State Board's regulations on the 91st

23 day following the State Board's receipt of the petition, which the State Board as November 22,

24 2021. The State Board has taken no action on Norwalk's administrative petition, other than the

25 October 21, 2021 letter. Accordingly, Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that

26 the State Board deemed the petition to have been dismissed as of close of business on November

27 22, 2021.

28 22. Upon the dismissal of its administrative petition by the State Board, Petitioner had

7

F

2 no further available administrative remedy to redress its grievances against the Regional Board
and the State Board other than through this timely filed Petition.

3 23.

4 Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies available to it, except where

5 exhaustion would be futile, and has performed all conditions precedent to Petitioner filing of this

Petition.

6 B. Petitioner Has No Adequate Remedy At Law

7 24. Petitioner does a not have a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary

8 course of law.

9 25.

10 Unless the requested writ herein is issued and the other relief requested herein is

11 granted, Respondents will proceed with the enforcement of the subject 2021 MS4 Permit, in
violation of and in excess of Respondents' authority under the Clean Water Act, the Porter-

13

& CASSO & SPARKS, LLP Suite *YLON  AMAd speoussosc 12 Cologne Act, the APA, Government Code § 17561, and other State law and the United States and

91746 14 California Constitutions. Furthermore, Petitioner may be subject to citizens' suits which seek to
enforce invalid provisions of the 2021 MS4 Permit.

8 15 C.

COR of Industry, Independent Judgment Standard of Review

16 26.

17 Water Code § 13330(e) provides in pertinent part that "the court shall exercise its

18 independent judgment on the evidence in any case involving judicial review of a decision or order

of the state board issued under Section 13320."

19 27.

20 Abuse of discretion is established if Respondents have not proceeded in the manner

21 required by law, the order or decision is not supported by the findings, and/or the findings are not

22 supported by the evidence in the administrative record. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5(b).) When it is

23 alleged that the findings are not supported by the evidence and the Court is authorized to exercise

24 its independent judgment, abuse of discretion is also established if the Court determines that the

25 findings are not supported by the weight of the evidence. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5(c).)

28.

26 Pursuant to Government Code §§ 11350 and 11350.3, this Court also has

27 jurisdiction to determine whether there is substantial evidence that Respondents have acted in

28 compliance with the process set forth in the APA for adopting administrative regulations and
conducting all of the administrative hearings in accordance with the APA.

U 29. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

4 The Clean Water Act prohibits the discharge of any pollutant into waters of the

5 United States except in compliance with one of the statute's regulatory or permit programs. (33
U.S.C. § 1311(a).)

6 30.

7 The Clean Water Act established the NPDES permit program as the mechanism for

8 permitting, and thus controlling, discharges of pollutants from point sources. (See 33 U.S.C. §

1342.)

9 31.

10 The Clean Water Act also a includes a separate "permit shield" that provides that

11
á Olt aunS 'YuoN 'Amad SpeOISSOI 13300 "[c]ompliance with a permit issued pursuant to this section shall be deemed compliance" for

12 purposes of Clean Water Act enforcement and citizen suits. (33 U.S.C. § 1342(k).) The Clean

13 Water Act, therefore, protects a permittee from liability where the permittee has complied with its

dT1 'SMHVáS & OSSVO & 91746 14 Clean Water Act permit. (33 U.S.C. § 1342(k).) This protection is known as the "permit shield."

8 15 Compliance with the terms of a NPDES permit bars Clean Water Act liability for any and all types
of discharges.
of Industry, 16 32.

17 In 1987, Congress amended the a CWA to establish a framework for regulating storm

18 water and urban runoff by adding Section 402(p) which requires the U.S. Environmental

19 Protection Agency (*USEPA") to establish regulations setting forth NPDES requirements for

20 storm water discharges. Section 402(p)(3)(B) of the CWA [33 U.S.C. § 1342(p)(3)(B)] requires

r21 permits for discharges from the MS4s to "require controls to reduce the discharge of pollutants to

22 the maximum extent practicable." Dischargers who are issued permits and who operate within the

23 terms of such permits are thereby in compliance with the requirements of the Clean Water Act.

33.

24 The Clean Water Act authorizes states to implement the NPDES program, which

25 includes issuance and enforcement of NPDES permits, such as the 2021 MS4 Permit in question.

26 (33 U.S.C. § 1342(b).) The State Board has accepted the delegation of authority from the USEPA

27 to implement the Clean Water Act's NPDES permit program. The State Board administers the
NPDES permit program in California.

28 34. Pursuant to a September 22, 1989 Memorandum of Agreement (the "MOA")

9
PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

between the USEPA - Region IX and the State Board, the State Board is authorized to administer

2 the NPDES permitting program in and for the State of California, and pursuant to provisions of the

3 Porter-Cologne Act, and specifically, Water Code § 13160. By entering into the MOA, the State

4 Board has obligated itself to, among other things, follow all applicable federal statutes, regulations

5 and policy in its administration of the NPDES permitting program in and for the State of

6 California. Additionally, pursuant to the MOA, the State Board is obligated to ensure that all

7 NPDES permits which are issued by any of the Regional Water Quality Control Boards comply

8 with applicable federal legal requirements.

35. Although the MOA between USEPA and the State Board assigned certain tasks to

10 the Regional Water Quality Control Boards, the State Board is the only California signatory to the
11 MOA and, ultimately, has responsibility for the State's compliance with the MOA and the
: JuNS 'YON KMMd speoissor 12 delegation of authority from the USEPA.
13 36. The MOA sets forth specific responsibilities of the State Board with respect to the

d17 SPARKS, 91746 14 NPDES program. Among those responsibilities are: (a) "supporting and overseeing the Regional

5 15 Board's management of the NPDES and pre-treatment programs in California"; (b) "evaluating
of Industry, 16 Regional Board performance in the areas of permit content procedure compliance, monitoring and

17
I surveillance, quality assurance of sample analyses and program enforcement"; (c) acting "on its

18 own motion as necessary to assure that the program is administered in conformance with federal

19 and state legislation regulations policy, this MOA and the State Annual 106 Work Plan"; and (d)

20 "reviewing decisions of the Regional Boards upon petition from aggrieved persons or upon its

21 own motion."

22 37. The Regional Board and State Board are authorized under California law to adopt

23 waste discharge requirements (*WDRs"). (See Wat. Code, §§ 13374, et seq.) The Regional

24 Board is the State agency that issues and enforces NPDES permits and WDRs within its

25 geographical jurisdiction, which includes the County of Los Angeles. The State Board is the

26 agency responsible for reviewing Regional Board actions.

27 38. Under Water Code § 13000, the waters of the State of California are to be regulated
28 as necessary to "attain the highest water quality which is reasonable, considering all demands

10
PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

- being made and to be made on those waters, and the total values involved, beneficial and

2 detrimental, economic and social, tangible and intangible."

3 39. Under Water Code § 13241, when establishing water quality objectives and water

4 quality control plans within its region, a Regional Water Quality Control Board is required to

5 consider specific factors, including, but not limited to: (a) Past, present and probable future

6 beneficial uses of water; (b) Environmental characteristics of the hydrographic unit under

7 consideration, including the quality of water available thereto; (c) Water quality conditions that

8 could reasonably be achieved through the coordinated control of all factors which affect water

9 quality in the area; and (d) Economic considerations.

10 40. In accordance with California law, in formulating and revising state policy for

11 water quality control the State Board is required to consult with and carefully evaluate the
9 12 recommendations of concerned federal, state and local agencies on water policy issues. (Wat.

13 Code, § 13144.) Further, in formulating water quality policy within their respective regions, the
d'I 'SMHVdS 97LI6 OINS HLON HOOYA PROSSEID OOSEI 8 ) *Ansnpuijo , 14 Regional Water Quality Control Boards are required to consult with and consider the

15 recommendations of affected local agencies. (Wat. Code, § 13240.)

16 41. Under Water Code § 13263(a), all "waste discharge requirements", such as those

17 issued with the adoption of the subject 2021 MS4 Permit, are to be issued: OsSVO 18 ... with relation to the conditions existing in the disposal area or receiving waters upon, or
19 into which, the discharge is made or proposed. The requirements shall implement any

20 relevant water quality control plans that have been adopted, and shall take into
21 consideration the beneficial uses to be protected, the water quality objectives reasonably
22 required for that purpose, other waste discharges, the need to prevent nuisance, and the

23 provisions of section 13241. (Wat. Code, §13263.)

24 42. Federal law similarly provides for the consideration of economics in the issuance of

25 NPDES permits. (See e.g., 33 U.S.C. §§ 1288, 1313 and 1315(b), and 64 Fed. Reg. 68722 and

26 68732.)

PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

1 V.

2 REASONS WHY THE ACTIONS OF RESPONDENTS WERE IMPROPER
3 AND IN EXCESS OF THETR JURISDICTION

4 43. The actions taken by the Respondents, among other things, place obligations on

5 Petitioner that are not mandated by, or violate, or are in excess of the Respondents' jurisdiction

6 and authority under the Clean Water Act and/or the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Act, unlawfully

7 impose obligations on Petitioner, violate the prohibitions found in Water Code 13360(a), and are

8 not supported by evidence in the administrative record before the Respondents. The 2021 MS4

9 Permit, therefore, does not comply with the requirements of the Clean Water Act and the Porter-

10 Cologne Act or the regulations promulgated thereunder, and other applicable law, and the manner

11 in which it was adopted did not comply with applicable State and federal law, including the APA,
9 12 the Water Code and the Clean Water Act. These actions taken by Respondents, and their failures

13 to act, were improper, inappropriate, arbitrary and capricious, and in violation of State and federal

d11 'SMaYdS 91746 oung *quON *ÁMNd SPROISSOAJ 00EEI 14 law. Accordingly, Respondents proceeded in excess of their jurisdiction and prejudicially abused

15 8 their discretion by failing to proceed in the manner required by law, and the findings in the
f Industry, 16 Regional Board Order, the State Board Order and upon which the 2021 MS4 Permit is based are

17 § OSSVO not supported by the evidence in the administrative record, as more particularly alleged herein.

18 44. The 2021 MS4 Permit contains numerous requirements not mandated by the Clean

19 Water Act and that were not developed and adopted in compliance with Water Code §§ 13000,

20 13263 and 13241 and were, therefore, in excess of Respondents' jurisdiction under such statutes

21 and Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by including such requirements in the 2021

22 MS4 Permit. The 2021 MS4 Permit also violates the constitutional prohibition of imposing

23 unfunded mandates on Petitioner, as set forth under Article XIII B. Section 6 of the California

24 Constitution, and the corresponding statutory prohibition on mandating the construction of major

25 waste water treatment facilities, such as will result from the adoption of the 2021 MS4 Permit.

26 (See Gov. Code, § 17516(c).) The NPDES permit itself does not contain any findings as to

27 economic considerations as required by Water Code § 13241. The Fact Sheet attached as

28 Attachment F to the 2021 MS4 Permit purports to set forth findings supporting the requirements of

12
PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

the 2021 MS4 Permit. No substantial evidence supports the Regional Board'&-Finding in the Fact

2 Sheet to the 2021 MS4 Permit that the Permit does not impose unfunded mandates on the

3 Permittees, including the Petitioner. (See, 2021 MS4 Permit, pp. 25-26.)

A (*TMDLs"), the 2021 M$4 Permit improperly requires compliance with a Watershed Management

8 Program (*WMP"), which is not authorized under federal or state law and in lieu of the Storm

9 Water Management Program ("SWMP")iterative process, which is mandated by federal and state

10 law. In so doing, the Regional Board failed to comply with the Clean Water Act §§

11 402(p)(3)(B)(iii) and 40 CFR §122.26(d)(iv). CWA § 402(p)(3)(B)(iii) requires MS4 permittees to
Olt DunS 'yLioN KMAd SpeOIsSOI) OCRi oSSVO 12 reduce pollutants to the Maximum Extent Practicable (*MEP").

13 46. Norwalk is in the Coyote Creek and Reach 1 of the San Gabriel River Subbasins of

d77 'SMHVdS: 9+LI6 14 San Gabriel River Watershed (See, Figure C-9 of Attachment C at p. C-14 and Attachment J to the

15 8 2021 MS4 Permit). The 2021 MS4 Permit reports that Norwalk spent $1,676,191 in 2019 for the
of Industry, 16 implementation of the stormwater programs required by previous permits. (Table F-37 of

17 Attachment F at p. F-340.) Under the terms 2021 MS4 Permit, the only TMDLs applicable to

18 Norwalk (other than the Trash TMDL) are the "San Gabriel River and Impaired Tributaries Metals

19 and Selenium TMDL" and the "San Gabriel River, Estuary and Tributaries Indicator Bacteria

20 TMDL." (See Tables J-15 and J-16 at pp. J-18 and J-20).

21 47. According to Table F-10 of the Permit's Fact Sheet, entitled "Summary of Wet

22 Weather Metals Receiving Water Monitoring Exceeding Criteria by Watershed (Exceedances/

23 Samples)," zero samples of the 91 samples taken exceeded the TMDL criteria for Dissolved Lead.

24 Only 9 of 91 samples exceeded the TMDL criteria for Total Lead. Similarly, zero samples of the

25 67 samples taken exceeded the TMDL criteria for Selenium. (See also Table F-11)

26 48. Similarly, Table F-12 of the Permit's Fact Sheet, entitled "Summary of Dry

27 Weather Metals Receiving Water Monitoring Exceeding Criteria by Watershed (Exceedances/

28 Samples)", shows zero samples of the 31 samples taken exceeded the TMDL criteria for

13
PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

- Dissolved Lead and zero of 31 samples exceeded the TMDL criteria for dissolved lead. Similarly,

2 only two samples of the 26 samples taken exceeded the TMDL criteria for Selenium.(See, also

3 Table F-13)

4 49. Reflecting this data, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's

5 current 2016 303 (d) list, Reach 1 of the San Gabriel River currently is no longer subject to the

6 metals TMDL. The Coyote Creek Tributary of the San Gabriel River is only subject to the Copper

7 TMDL The Regional Board has asked USEPA that Copper be de-listed as a TMDL for Reach

8 based on its conclusion that:

"Based on the readily available data and information, the weight of evidence indicates
that there is sufficient justification against placing this water segment-pollutant
combination on the CWA section 303(d) List in the Water Quality Limited Segments

Suite *YLION 'AM%d speoissor 13300 category. This conclusion is based on the staff findings that:
1. The data used satisfies the data quality requirements of section 6.1.4 of the
dTT'SHäVdS 8 OSSVO * 91746 Policy.

5 2. The data used satisfies the data quantity requirements of section 6.1.5 of the
City of Industry, 2=9991000 Policy.
3.0 of 1 and 0 of 82 samples exceeded the CRITERIA and this does not exceed the
18 allowable frequency listed in Table 3.1 of the Listing Policy.

19 4. Pursuant to section 3.11 of the Listing Policy, no additional data and information

20 are available indicating that standards are not met."

21 50. Regional Board Staff reached the same conclusions for the Lead TMDL.

22 51. Regional Board staff have also asked that Selenium, Zinc and Lead bejde-listed for

23 Coyote Creek. (They have also asked that the metals Copper, Selenium, Zinc and Lead be de-

24 listed as TMDL for Reach 2of the San Gabriel River.)

25 52. Therefore, the 2021 MS4 Permit, as seen in attachments K through S, improperly

26 requires compliance with TMDLs which are no longer on the State's CWA § 303(d) list.

27 Nevertheless, Regional Board staff claimed, in writing, and at the July 23,2021 public hearing,

28 that it has this authority because a non-impaired upstream reach, despite not 303(d) listed, can

14
PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

"cause or contribute" to an impairment of a downstream reach. The evidence in the administrative

2 record does not support such assertion. This is not a State policy consistent with 303(d) listing

3 criterion. (See Water Quality Control Policy For Developing California's Clean Water Act

4 Section 303(d) List, 2015.) Despite the fact that as a result of Norwalk and the other Permittees

5 efforts, water quality has substantially improved in the San Gabriel River to the point that the

6 Regional Board itself has confirmed that most of the TMDLs applicable to the watershed are no

7 longer necessary, to implement the TMDLs imposed by the 2021 MS4 Permit by the Regional

8 Board's own estimation would require the expenditure by the Permittees of:

(a) $536.42 million in 2019 dollars in capital costs; 9

(b) $26.82 million in annual operation and maintenance costs; and $1.07283 10

11 billion total costs over a 20-year period. (See Table F-28 of the Fact Sheet at p. F-325.)
91746 O1P aNS TELONE HAUMSPROSNDAD OER 8 f Industry, 12 Again, the Regional Board is requiring the Permittees, including Norwalk, to spend over a billion

13 dollars over the next 20 years to build and maintain massive structure and implement programs
d'T1'sMarÿds 14 ostensibly to address contaminants that are no longer found in the San Gabriel River!

15 53. The Regional Board apparently is also unmindful of the fact that it had

16 recommended to the State Board to de-list several TMDLs despite being in the 2021 MS4 Permit;
* 17 and that in its 2020-2022 Triennial Review it affirmed that TMDLs are reach-dependent, which OSSVO 18 further debunks the "cause of contribute" argument. The invalid TMDLs contained in the 2021

19 MS4 Permit include all metals for the San Gabriel River (except lead for Reach 2); metals for

20 Reaches 2 and 2 3 of the Rio Hondo; metals for Reach 4 of the Los Angeles River; and metals for

21 - Reaches 1 and 2 for 2 the Arroyo Seco. Requiring compliance with expired or unauthorized TMDLs

22 violates CWA §303(d) and is an underground regulation under the APA..

23 B. The 2021 MS4 Permit improperly requires compliance with CWA Section 301.

24 54. The 2021 MS4 Permit improperly requires compliance with CWA Section 301 (33
25 U.S.C. § 1311) -which is not applicable to municipal separate storm sewer systems pursuant to

26 CWA Section 402(p)(3)(B) (33 U.S.C. § 1342(p)(3)(B))- -by (i) implementing Technology-Based

27 Effluent Limitations (*TBELs") to the MEP; and (ii) forcing a permittee to achieve absolute and

28 stringent compliance with TMDLs and WQS if the permittee chooses not participate in a WMP or

15
PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

if it wishes to opt out of one. CWA section 301(b)(1)(B) requires meeting water quality standards

2 as stringent as necessary. Although the Regional Board claims that the 2021 MS4 Permit does not
implement CWA $ 301, in de facto terms, it does. Part IV.A of the Permit references Technology

4 Based Effluent Limitations (*TBELs") that are to reduce pollutants in stormwater discharges

5 from the MS4 to the maximum extent practicable. According to 40 CFR § 122.44(a)(1):

6 Technology-based effluent limitations are promulgated under section 301 of the CWA. Further
complicating matters, the 2021 MS4 Permit offers no explanation of the TBELs' purpose. It also

8 does not define the maximum extent practicable, as it relates to TBELs, which is not found in

9 federal law. The MEP standard only applies to municipal discharges covered by CWA §

10 402(p)3(B)(iii) (33 U.S.C. § 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii)). CWA § 301 apparently is also the basis for the
11 2021 MS4 Permit's strict compliance requirement in Part V.A.I - that is, if a permittee does not
: oins *Y)ION 'AMMd speoIssor 00EEI 12 participate in a WMP it will be in violation in the event TMDL/WQS is not met. This, of course,
13 is inconsistent with CWA § 402(p)3(B)(iii), which requires only a reduction of a pollutant to the
dTT'SHäVdS 91746 14 MEP.

8 15 C. The 2021 MS4 Permit improperly requires MS4 permittees located in the Los
City of Industry, g! Angetes and San Gabrie River sub-watersheds, and their tributqries, to comply
17
CASSO with monitoring requirements associated with the Dominguez Channel Harbor
18 Toxics TMDL.

19 55. The 2021 MS4 Permit improperly requires MS4 permittees located in the Los

20 Angeles and San Gabriel River sub-watersheds, and their tributaries, to comply with monitoring

21 requirements associated with the Dominguez Channel Harbor Toxics TMDL. The San Gabriel

22 River, Los Angeles River, and Dominguez Channel/Harbor are separate and distinct water bodies

23 and watersheds, each with different pollution issues and beneficial uses. The Regional Board's

24 rationale requiring almost 50 permittees in the Los Angeles and San Gabriel River watersheds

25 (who have been designated as "responsible parties") is to determine compliance with TMDLs

26 (metals and pesticides) assigned to the Dominguez Channel/Harbors. The definition of a

27 "responsible party" is not provided either in the 2021 MS4 Permit or in the Dominguez

28 Channel/Harbor TMDL. Presumably, the parties are responsible based on the assumption that

16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

- they cause or contribute to the impairment of the harbors, despite the absence of any supporting

2 data. Further, as mentioned above, "cause or contribute" is not a criterion for determining a

3 TMDL. Also, Los Angeles River and San Gabriel River Permittees are not included on the 2010

4 or 2016 § 303(d) list for the Dominguez Channel/Harbors TMDL and, therefore, cannot be subject

5 to it. Flow from upstream Los Angeles and San Gabriel River Permittee jurisdictions is incapable

6 of reaching those harbors. In the case of the upper Rio Hondo (Reaches 2 and 3), which is

7 tributary to the Los Angeles River, and San Gabriel River (Reach 3 and above), flow could not

8 reach the harbors because it would be intercepted and retained in the spreading grounds for

9 infiltration. In the case of the lower San Gabriel River, flow could not reach the nearest harbor

10 (Long Beach) because it flows to Seal Beach, which is locate approximately 6 miles west of it.

11 The monitoring requirement includes testing in the harbor, including sampling for sediment
9
91746 DINS YLONLHAOMESPROSSOED OGR 6 f Industry, 12 contamination in harbor floors. However, federal regulations only require MS4 outfall discharge

13 monitoring---unless there is no outfall from which to monitor. There are outfalls for all reaches of

dT1'SHäVdS N OSSVO 14 the Los Angeles and San Gabriel rivers. Requiring compliance with this monitoring requirement

15 imposes an unjustifiable cost on the City and other impacted permittees while potentially exposing

16 them unnecessarily to violations. This requirement is therefore, arbitrary and capricious, not

17 supported by evidence in the administrative record and constitutes an abuse of discretion.

18 D. The 2021 MS4 Permit improperly requires permittees, through a WMP, to

19 implement stormwater capture and retention controls.

20 56. The 2021 MS4 Permit, under Part IX.A.k, improperly requires permittees, through

21 a WMP, to implement stormwater capture and retention controls. The purpose of the controls is to

22 achieve compliance with TMDLs/WQS by retaining the runoff volume of the 85th percentile, 24-

23 hour storm event for the drainage area tributary to the applicable receiving water. However,

24 according to the State Board's Order WQ0 2015-0075 (In The Matter Of Review Of Waste

25 Discharge Requirements For Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Discharges Within

26 The Coastal Watersheds Of Los Angeles County, Except Those Discharges Originating From The
27 City Of Long Beach MS4, 2015 WL 4071332 (Cal.St.Wat.Res.Bd. 2015)), "With regard to

28 evidence in the Administrative Record, it is clear that the storm water retention approach is a

17
-PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

- promising approach for achieving compliance with receiving water limitations, with multiple

2 additional environmental benefits. But the research regarding the storm water retention approach

3 is still in early stages and we cannot say with certainty at this point that implementation will lead

4 to compliance with receiving water limitations in all cases." The State Board's caveat reflects

5 USEPA's doubts regarding the scientific validity of stormwater capture/retention controls, based

6 on the 85th percentile design storm, to achieve WQS. John Kemmerer, Associate Director,

7 USEPA Region IX, Water Division, first expressed this at the November 12, 2012, 2012 MS4

8 permit adoption hearing (see transcript page 104 and 105). USEPA Region IX (David Smith, 2021

9 MS4 Permits Manager) also reiterated this concern later in a comment letter on the State Boards

10 draft WQ0 dated January 20, 2015. He wrote: "we do not believe that the permit's record
11 supports the conclusion that this retention will result in achievement of WLAs".
e E. The 2021 MS4 Permit improperly requires compliance with wet-weather WOS. duing *YLION *ÁMAd SPPOISSOID 00EEI ~s2 57. The 2021 MS4 Permit improperly requires compliance with wet-weather WQS.

dT1'SHHVdS 91746 14 Almost all of the WQS, and the TMDLs on which they are based, are expressed in terms of dry

15 5 and wet weather numeric limitations. However, according to WQO 2001-15: "There is no

16 provision in state or federal law that mandates adoption of separate water quality standards for

17 wet weather condition." (State Water Resources Control Board 2021 MS4 Permit 2001-15, page OSSVO of Industry,
á 18 10.) This infers that WQS are dry weather standards. According to CWA §303(d) and the

19 California Toxics Rule, (40 CFR Part 131, Water Quality Standards; Establishment of Numeric

20 Criteria for Priority Toxic Pollutants for the State of California), WQS are based on ambient water

21 conditions. This is also reflected in USEPA guidance documents for bacteria and toxics. The

22 federal definition of an ambient water is taken from 40 CFR § 122.21(g)(7)(ii), and is based on

23 the following:

24 "stormwater discharges, which shall be collected from the discharges resulting from a

25 storm event that is greater than 0.1 inch and the last 72 hours from the previously

26 measurable (greater than 01. inch rainfall) storm event. The interval period between the

27 two is the ambient condition of a water body from which the samples are collected."

28 58. Moreover, according to State Board and Regional Board Surface Water Ambient

18
PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

- Monitoring Programs (*SWAMPs"), sampling is done during the dry season, as the following

2 excerpt from a SWAMP document illustrates:

3 "All SWAMP-funded bio-assessments shall include sampling during the most appropriate
1 1000 index period (i.e., time of year that samples are collected). This interim guidance is needed
to ensure data comparability by requiring that samples are collected during standardized
index periods. Since the appropriate index period varies at different latitudes and
elevations (southern latitudes are generally sampled in late spring and northern latitude

8 sites are generally sampled in late summer.

9 (Seethttp://swamp.mpsl.mlmt.calstate.edu/resources-and-dowploads/standard-operating

10 procedures. Southern California is located in a southern latitude.) "

11 59. Requiring compliance with wet weather WQS is more difficult and significantly
: 12 more costly than compliance with ambient water conditions. The requirement, in effect, is oing *quoN *Amad SpeOIssOIg 13 tantamount to placing a thumb on a scale.
9+LI6 VO *Ausnpui jo 00551 dTT'SXHVdS ? OSSVO 14 F. The 2021 MS4 Permit requires meeting TMDL compliance schedules contrary to

15 state and federal regulations.

16 60. The 2021 MS4 Permit requires meeting TMDL compliance schedules contrary to
E 17 state and federal regulations. As mentioned during several Regional Board workshops, compliance

18 schedules are not required of MS4 NPDES permits. This is validated by State Policy Resolution

19 2008-0025, which is based on 23 C.C.R. § 2918, Policy for Compliance Schedules in 2021 MS4

20 Permits. The policy and resolution affirm that compliance schedules only apply to dischargers

21 subject to CWA § 301. Although Regional Board staff admitted that compliance schedules apply
22 only to CWA § 301 discharges, it argued that they are still required under 40 CFR $122.47,

23 Schedules of Compliance. The regulatory history of this regulation clearly indicates that it only

24 intended to apply to CWA § 301 discharges. A 2016 letter from Regional Board staff to USEPA

25 Region IX stated:

26 "Compliance Schedule Policy does not apply to MS4 Permits, as the Policy expressly only

27 applies to effluent limitations established under CWA section 301(b)(1)(C). Rather,

28 effluent limitations in MS4 permits are established pursuant to CWA section 402(p)(3)(B)

19

- and, if applicable, section 303(d). (Letter from former Regional Board Executive Officer

2 Sam Unger to Tomas Torres, USEPA Water Division Director, USEPA Region IX, June

3 23, 2016, page 2)

4 61. Actually, compliance with TMDLs and WQS is to be achieved through the 5-year

5 term of the 2021 MS4 Permit, subject to the SWMP/iterative process. Should additional time be

6 required to complete a TMDL compliance task, it can be carried over to the next permit cycle. As

7 such, requiring compliance schedules is arbitrary and capricious and constitutes an abuse of

8 discretion.

9 62. a According to a 2016 letter from United States Environmental Protection Agency

10 (USEPA) Region IX to the State Board, MEP is achieved through an iterative process. That

11 September 13, 2016, letter from USEPA Region IX Administrator Alexis Strauss to State Water
: 12 Board Chair Felicia Marcus states: "EPA envisions application of the maximum extent practicable

13 standard as an iterative process.... Successive iterations of the mix of BMPs [best management

d'II'SXHVdS 91746 § oinS '4uon ÁMyd SpROIssoI 00EEI oSSVO 14 practices] and measurable goals that will be driven by the objective of assuring maintenance of

15 8 water quality standards." USEPA's letter also affirms that 40 CFR § 122.26(d)(iv), implements §

16

2 *Ansnpujjo 402(p)(3)(B)(iii) by requiring a SWMP. MS4 permits issued in California are required to comply

17 with 402(p)(3)(B)(iii) and 40 CFR § 122.26(d)(iv), pursuant to State Water Board Water Quality

18 2021 MS4 Permit (WQO) 99-05. WQ0 99-05 was intended to achieve compliance with receiving

19 water limitations (includes WQS and TMDLs) by implementing a SWMP governed by an iterative

20 process. The 2021 MS4 Permit does implement WQO 99-05 in Part V.A-D. Sub-part "C"

21 specifically addresses the SWMP requirement and includes the iterative process. However, Part

22 X.A.2 of the MS4 permit effectively eliminates the SWMP: "Compliance with the prodedure

23 described in Part V.C of this 2021 MS4 Permit does not constitute compliance with the receiving

24 water limitations provisions of Part V.A and Part V.B of this 2021 MS4 Permit." Part X.B.1.b.i of

25 the 2021 MS4 Permit replaces the SWMP with a WMP as the following states: "A Permittee shall

26 be deemed in compliance with interim {and final} WQBELs and receiving water limitations if it is

27 implementing an approved Watershed Management Program." The revision to Part V.C violates

28 CWA Section 402(p)(3)(B)(iii), 40 CFR §122.26(d)(iv), and WQO 99-05. CWA Section 402(k),

63. The 2021 MS4 Permit Does Not Comply With the Clean Water Act

5 Under section 402 of the Clean Water Act, permits are to be issued "from

6 municipal storm sewers .. to reduce the discharge of pollutants to the maximum extent

7

8 practicable." In accordance with CWA section 402(p), operators of MS4s and permittees under a

9 MS4 NPDES permit are not required to strictly comply with water quality standards. Instead,

10 MS4s are regulated by NPDES permits which are intended to reduce the discharge of pollutants in

11 the storm water discharged by MS4 to the "Maximum Extent Practicable" ("MEP"). (See 33
U.S.C. § 1342(p)(3)(B)(iii).)

OSSVO 'SMHVaS ? dI 91746 OUNS 'YLION AMXd SPROISSOI) 00EEI 14 Best Management Practices ("BMPs") are implemented to the MEP. (See 40 C.F.R. § 122.44(k).)

15 The MEP standard is a maximum standard and is the only standard to be applied to Permittees
under either State or federal law.

8 65.

f Industry, 16

17 A necessary implication of the iterative process is that the Permittees will adopt

á 18 programs and practical BMPs to meet their obligations under the 2021 MS4 Permit, with the aim

19 of ultimately reducing pollutants in stormwater flow from the MS4 to the Maximum Extent

20 Practicable and that these programs or practical BMPs will either not feasibly eliminate or will fail

21 to reduce stormwater runoff into the MS4 Systems to the intended degree in the 2021 MS4 Permit
term. The iterative process is a standard MS4 feature in State-issued MS4 permits.

66.

22

23 The 2021 MS4 Permit violates the Clean Water Act by failing to recognize the

24 iterative process dictated by the Clean Water Act and by attempting to impose performance
standards which are more onerous than the MEP standard.

67.

25

26 Furthermore, the 2021 MS4 Permit attempts to diminish the permit shield to which
a permittee is entitled under the Clean Water Act while it is engaged in the iterative process.

2 The provisions of the 2021 MS4 Permit also inappropriately expose Permittees,

3 such as Norwalk, which are implementing pollution reduction programs to the maximum extent

4 practicable to unjustified enforcement actions and spurious third-party lawsuits, as it improperly

5 holds Permittees responsible for the discharges of others "to" its MS4, and as it inappropriately

is made, the full text of the resulting adoption, amendment, or repeal, with the change

2 clearly indicated, shall be made available to the public for at least 15 days before the

3 agency adopts, amends, or repeals the resulting regulation. Any written comments received

4 regarding the change must be responded to in the final statement of reasons required by

Un Section 11346.9.

(d) No state agency shall add any material to the record of the rulemaking proceeding after

7 the close of the public hearing or comment period, unless the agency complies with

8 Section 11347.1. This subdivision does not apply to material prepared pursuant to Section
11346.9.

10 (e) If a comment made at a public hearing raises a new issue concerning proposed
regulation and a member of the public requests additional time to respond to the new issue
: 99 before the state agency takes final action, it is the intent of the Legislature that rulemaking
agencies consider granting the request for additional time if, under the circumstances,

which generated it, did not comply with 15 78. The 2021 MS4 Permit, and the process
16 applicable principles of California and federal administrative law.
* 9+L16_VO °Ansnpurjo granting the request is practical and does not unduly delay action on the regulation.."

17 79. Although the Respondents have taken the position that the proceedings for the
18 adoption of the 2021 MS4 Permit were adjudicative under the APA, they failed to conduct those

19 proceedings in accordance with Government Code §§ 11400, et seq., and the State Board's own

20 regulations for the conduct of adjudicative proceedings set forth in Sections 648, et seq., of Title

21 23 of the California Code of Regulations and failed to provide Petitioner its rights under the

22 Administrative Adjudication Bill of Rights.

23 80. Petitioner is also informed and believes and thereon alleges that the Regional Board

24 and the State Board failed to separate the prosecutorial functions of their counsel from such

25 counsel's adjudicative and advisory roles. Also, the hearings were not conducted by neutral fact
finders. The Respondents also failed to provide the Petitioner and the other Permittees a full and

witnesses and evidence 26

27 fair right to be heard at the hearings on the 2021 MS4 Permit or to present

28 at the hearing and the right to cross-examine witnesses. Petitioner is also inforrhed and believes

24
PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

and thereon alleges that in reaching its findings and decisions the Regional Board reljed on

2 evidence outside of the administrative record or evidence which was not offered or admitted into

3 evidence at their hearings and, in many instances, on the basis of no evidence at all.

4 81. By proceeding in a manner which violated the APA and the State Board's own
regulations for the conduct of adjudicative proceedings, the Respondents improperly denied

6 Petitioner and other interested parties a fair hearing in their consideration of the 2021 MS4 Permit
In violation of the APA and Petitioner's due process rights under both the California and the

8 United States Constitution.

9 K. The 2021 MS4 Permit Infringes Upon the Local Land Use Authority of the

Petitioner 10

11 82. The Clean Water Act requires the traditional planning power of local authorities
: 12 over land use issues to be preserved and protected. (33 U.S.C. 1251(b).) Congress, under the

(Id.) J}nS *YLON *AMNd SpeOSSOId 13 Clean Water Act, specifically chose to "recognize, preserve and protect the primary responsibility

d11'SMVdS % OSSVO 9†LI6 Va *Knsnpuijo 14 and rights of states ... to plan the development and use ... of land and water resources ....

15 The regulations to the Clean Water Act further recognize the concerns with "possible federal

16 interference with local land use planning," and USEPA has expressly determined not to infringe

17 on local land use authority.
OER 18 83. Pursuant to § Government Code § 65300.9, the Legislature has already expressed its

19 intent that it is "for each city and county to coordinate its local budget planning and local planning
with the local land use planning process, recognizing 20 for federal and state program activities
21 that each city and county is required to establish its own appropriate balance in the context of the

22 local situation when allocating resources to meet the purposes." (Gov. Code, § 65300.) The

23 requirements of the 2021 MS4 Permit violate the policies and purpose of the Porter-Cologne Act,

24 the Clean Water Act and applicable State and federal laws which grant the Petitioner, not the

25 Respondent, the authority to review "discretionary" projects for purposes of considering whether

26 such projects will have significant adverse impact on the environment, and for purposes, if

27 necessary, of adopting appropriate "mitigation measures."

28 84. The 2021 MS4 Permit requires fundamental changes in land use planning and

25
PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

indicates the Regional Board's intent to direct local land use decisions. These goals and

2 objectives are ultra vires in that they exceed the agency's lawful jurisdiction; they also unlawfully
infringe on local governmental authority. The 2021 MS4 Permit seeks to improperly infringe

4 upon and interfere with the local land use planning and regulatory authority of the Permittees.

85. The 2021 MS4 Permit contains numerous provisions that exceed the Respondents'

6 statutory authority to regulate discharges. Many of the 2021 MS4 Permit's provisions regulate the

7 general use of land, the hydrology of the landscape, on-site and downstream erosion, as well as

8 other areas that are clearly ultra vires to the Respondents' statutory authority. In general, the 2021

9 MS4 Permit places illegal restrictions on when, where and how development can take place.

10 86. Neither the administrative record nor the 2021 MS4 Permit's Fact Sheet contain

11 admissible, credible evidence of the Regional Board supporting the Respondents' actions.
9 ~ L. Other Grounds.
13 87. In addition to the foregoing, the coercive requirements in the 2021 MS4 Permit that

SPARKS, LLP , 31nS "YLON *RMXJ SPROISSOD 00EEI 91746 14 Petitioner adopt specific ordinances and regulate the activities of third parties violate California

5 15 law, as well as the California and United States Constitutions.

16 88. Neither the administrative record nor the 2021 MS4 Permit's Fact Sheet contains
8 OSSVO of Industry, 17 admissible, credible evidence of the Regional Board supporting the Respondents' actions. In
§ 18 taking the actions alleged herein, the Respondents abused their discretion, acted contrary to law,

19 and their decisions were not supported by substantial evidence.

20 M. How Petitionerds Aggrieved.

21 89. Petitioner is a Permittee under the 2021 MS4 Permit. Petitioner is generally

22 aggrieved by the actions of Respondents for the following reasons:

23 (a) The 2021 MS4 Permit imposes unnecessary and enormous costs on the City

24 by: (i) requiring compliance with TMDLs not on the state's CWA §303(d) list; (ii) forcing

25 participation in a WMP, despite not being a state or federal requirement; (iii) requiring monitoring

26 for the Dominguez Channel Harbor Toxics TMDL despite being outside of the City's watershed;

27 and (iv) complying with TMDLs that were based on wet-weather water quality monitoring instead
28 of on ambient water quality monitoring.

26
PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

(b) Participating in a WMP, which requires stormwater capture and retention

2 controls and does not guarantee compliance with TMDLs/WQS because of the uncertainty of the
85th percentile design criterion in achieving such compliance. This exposes the City to citizen
4 lawsuits and is a waste of City funds.

5 (c) Failing to provide adequate public review, which was not only denied to

6 permittees, but to the public in general.

7 (d) The 2021 MS4 Permit contains several provisions that are in conflict and

8 confusing, thereby shifting liability away from the Regional Board and unnecessarily exposing the

9 City to violations for non-compliance.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
AGAINST ALL RESPONDENTS 9 91LI6 OuNS TLONE JGOMSPROSSOLN OR 8 *Ánsnpujjo / = ~ WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDATE - CALIFORNIA WATER CODE $ 13330
13 90. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation
d11'SMäVdS 8 OSSVJ 14 contained in Paragraphs 1 through 89 and 111 through 125 of this Petition.
15 91. Petitioner is subject to the terms and requirements of the 2021 MS4 Permit and.
16 thus, is a party who is beneficially interested in the subject of this Petition.
17 92. The Porter-Cologne Act authorizes the Respondents to adopt waste discharge
18 requirements that reflect certain statutory factors including, without limitation, the beneficial uses
19 to be protected, the water quality objectives reasonably required to protect such uses, reasonably
20 achievable water quality, local factors affecting water quality, the need for housing, and economic
21 conditions. (Wat. Code, §§ 13241 and 13263(a).) The Respondents failed to consider these
22 statutory factors in conjunction with adoption of the 2021 MS4 Permit and failed to include
23 substantial evidence in the administrative record of any such consideration.
24
93. The 2021 MS4 Permit regulates urban and stormwater runoff entering storm drains
[25 and water bodies throughout the County, during both wet and dry periods, and for all seasons of
26
the year. There is no substantial evidence in the administrative record that the Respondents
27 considered the beneficial uses of all the water bodies for which it set discharge requirements, or
28 what water quality objectives were reasonably required to protect such uses, or all the factors
27
PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

-

2 affecting water quality in the region, or what water quality could be reasonably achieved in light

3 of these factors, or the need to develop housing in the County, or the economic impacts of the vast

D majority of the 2021 MS4 Permit's provisions.

94.

5 Additionally, the Water Code prohibits the State Board or Regional Board from

6 mandating the manner of compliance a Permittee a must utilize in order to achieve compliance with

7 regional board discharge requirements. (Wat. Code, § 13360(a).) In contravention of the Section

8 13360(a) mandate, the 2021 MS4 Permit consists of numerous specific directions on how the

9 Petitioner must implement the 2021 MS4 Permit. The 2021 MS4 Permit's specific directions

10 require very specific actions that Petitioner must take in order to comply with the 2021 MS4

Permit.

11 95.
: 91746 B 8 of Industry, 12 As alleged herein, Respondents have prejudicially abused their discretion, contrary

denied due

21 process of law, in violation of the United States and California Constitutions;

(c)

22 Respondents' findings in the 2021 MS4 Permit were not supported by

23 substantial evidence, and the requirements and conditions set forth in the 2021 MS4 Permit are not

28 substantive changes prior to the adoption of the 2021 MS4 Permit, as required by law, resulted in

28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

a Petitioner being denied a full opportunity to review and comment on all such changes, and being

2 denied due process of law, in violation of the United States and California Constitutions; and
c (f) Respondents failed to comply with the requirements of the APA, and acted
contrary to federal and State law, as described herein.
u 96. Respondents had a clear duty to provide a fair hearing, to comply with the Clean
6 Water Act, the Porter-Cologne Act, the APA, and other State and federal laws and regulations, as

7 well as to act in accordance with the United States and California Constitutions.

8 97. In taking the above actions, the Respondents abused their discretion, acted contrary

9 to law and in excess of their jurisdiction, and their decisions were not supported by substantial

10 evidence.

11 98. For reasons set forth in this Petition, issuance of a writ of mandate will result in the
91746 O1F DIMS HLOR BAA MPROSIOI ONR 8 *Ánsnpuijo. 12 enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest and will confer a significant benefit

where 13 on the general public.

99. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies available to it, except SPARKS, LLP 14

15 exhaustion would be futile, and has performed all conditions precedent to Petitioner filing of this

16 Petition. Petitioner has no adequate legal remedy in the ordinary course of law other than the

8 17 issuance by this Court of a writ of mandate. ossvo 18 100. Accordingly, this action is appropriately brought pursuant to Water Code § 13330

19 and Petitioner is entitled to a writ of mandate pursuant to Section 13330.

20 101. Unless the writ requested herein are issued and the other relief requested herein is

29
PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

- 104.

2 Accordingly, Petitioner asks this Court to:

(a)

3

4 Invalidate the 2021 MS4 Permit on the grounds that when the Regional

5 Board issued the Order on July 23, 2021: (i) it failed to comply with federal and state law; (ii) it

6 failed to comply with several State Board precedential WQOs; (iii) it failed to comply with the

7 APA; and (iv) it imposed requirements on the City and other permittees that are arbitrary and
capricious and constitute an abuse of discretion; and .

(b)

8 for correction.

9 Remand the 2021 MS4 Permit to the Regional Board and the State Board

105.

10

11 Petitioner requests a stay of the implementation and enforcement of these unlawful

9 12 preliminary and permanent injunction, as

13 permanent damage and irreparable harm may occur as a result of the implementation and

SPARKS, LLP 91746 14 enforcement of the offending terms, because, in part, significant costs and resources will be
expended towards compliance with such deficient and invalid terms, and because Petitioner herein

8 15

16 will be subject to unwarranted and inappropriate citizen suits and enforcement actions under the

106.

8 oing 'quion 'AMNd SPROISSOJD OOEEI of Industry, 17 Clean Water Act, and other potential unwarranted litigation, if such relief is not granted.

18 The issuance of a writ of mandate against Respondents requiring the correction of

19 the unlawful provisions in the 2021 MS4 Permit will result in the enforcement of an important

20 right affecting the public interest and will confer a significant benefit on the public at large.

107.

21 Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5 authorizes this Court to issue a stay of the

22 operation of an administrative order or decision pending judgment of the Court, if the Court

23 determines that the stay is in the interest of the public, as it is in this case. Code of Civil
Procedure §§ 526 and 527 and Water Code $ 13361 authorize the Court to issue a temporary

25 restraining order, a preliminary injunction and/or a permanent injunction under the appropriate
24 T circumstances, which circumstances exist in this case.

27 Petitioner therefore seeks and is entitled under Code of Civil Procedure § § 526 and

28 527, Civil Code 3422, and Water Code § 13361 to a stay or a preliminary and/or permanent
injunction, enjoining Respondents from proceeding further with the administration,

109. Petitioner further seeks a stay of the implementation and enforcement of the

2 offending portions of the 2021 MS4 Permit, as well as preliminary and permanent injunctions

result 3 pursuant to California Water Code 13361, as permanent damage and irreparable harm may

4 as a result of the implementation and enforcement of the 2021 MS4 Permit, and as significant

5 costs and resources will be expended towards compliance with such invalid provisions, and as

6 Petitioner herein will be subject to unwarranted and inappropriate citizen suits and enforcement

7 actions under the Clean Water Act, and other potential and unwarranted litigation, if such relief is

8 not granted.

10 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
AGAINST ALL RESPONDENTS 11 WRIT OF MANDATE PURSUANT TO C.C.P. S 1094.5(b)
: 12 110. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation
13 contained in Paragraphs 1 through 109 and 116 through 125 of this Petition.
& SPARKS, LLP 9tL16 ounS 'quoN *KMNd SPROISSOI 14 111. The Regional Board's Order and the failure of the State Board to address the relief
15 8 sought in the Petitioner's petition of the Regional Board Order through the State Board Order were Ansnpuijo 16 invalid under California Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5(b) and Water Code 13330.
17 Specifically, the Respondents (a) proceeded in excess of their jurisdiction, (b) denied Petitioner a
18 fair hearing before the Regional Board and the State Board, (c) prejudicially abused their
19 discretion in that the Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law, (d) adopted and
20 issued decisions not supported by legally adequate findings, and (e) adopted findings that were not
21 supported by substantial evidence.
22
112. Respondents' actions in adopting the 2021 MS4 Permit, without providing
23 Petitioner sufficient opportunity to review and comment on all substantive changes prior to the
24 adoption of the 2021 MS4 Permit, as required by law, resulted in Petitioner being denied a full
25 opportunity to review and comment on all such changes, and being denied due process of law, in
26 violation of the United States and California Constitutions.
27 113. Respondents had a clear duty to provide a fair hearing, to comply with the Clean

6 comply with applicable State and federal law.

VIII. 7

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 8

AGAINST ALL RESPONDENTS 9 FOR WRIT OF MANDATE PURSUANT TO C.C.P. § 1094.5(c)
10 115. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference each and every allegation
11 contained in Paragraphs I through 114 of this Petition.
12 116. The California Code of Civil Procedure allows for review of the Respondents' 13 findings made in the 2021 MS4 Permit on the basis that they are not supported by "substantial
91LI6 410 JunS "YLON *AMNd SpROIssoJg 5 of Industry, 8 14 evidence in light of the whole record." (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5(c).)
15 117. Because the issuance and approval of the 2021 MS4 Permit is, in part, a quasi-
16 adjudicatory function, the Respondents were required to adopt findings which were grounded
17 a upon a reasonable factual basis and were supported by precise and specific reasons founded on
18 tangible record evidence.
19 118. The Respondents' adoption of findings were without substantial support in the
20 record, were contrary to law, an abuse of discretion, arbitrary and capricious and not supported by
21 the record.
22 119. In taking the above actions, the Respondents issued their findings without
support thereof. Respondents 23 substantial evidence admitted into the administrative record in
24 abused their discretion, acted contrary to law, and their decisions were not supported by

28 well as to act in accordance with the United States and California Constitutions.

32
PETITION FOR WRIT OF ADMINISTRATIVE MANDAMUS

L 121. Accordingly, Petitioner is entitled, among other things, to an alternative and

2 peremptory writ of mandate directing the Respondents to vacate and set aside the offending
portions of the 2021 MS4 Permit, to set a new hearing date for consideration of a revised 2021
4 MS4 Permit and to comply with applicable State and federal law.
5 122. Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5 authorizes this Court to issue a stay of the
6 operation of an administrative order or decision pending judgment of the Court, if the Court

7 determines that the stay is in the interest of the public, as it is in this case. Further, Code of Civil

8 Procedure §§ 526 and 527 and Water Code § 13361 authorize this Court to issue a temporary

9 restraining order, preliminary injunction and/or a permanent injunction under the present

10 I circumstances.

11 123. Respondents will continue to proceed in a manner that will force the Petitioner to
- 12 suffer great and irreparable harm. Without modification of the 2021 MS4 Permit and an

13 injunction, Petitioner will be required to choose between (a) complying with an unlawful 2021

dTT'SMHVS 9PLI6 14 MS4 Permit at tremendous economic, social and political cost, and (b) not complying with the
unlawful 2021 MS4 Permit and risk enforcement action by the Respondents and citizen-suit 8 15

*Ánsnpuijo. 16 litigation by third parties. The requirements and prohibitions will result in a significant loss of

d 17 municipal services and economic activity and disrupt homebuilding and construction in the City of I 18 Norwalk and throughout the County of Los Angeles. In addition, the Regional Board's subjective

19 interpretations of the law will force Petitioner to accept the burden of complying with standards

20 that are exceedingly onerous because they are vague and unpredictable in their specific application

21 to any given issue.

22 124. Petitioner cannot be fully compensated in damages for these harms and has no

23 adequate remedy at law. If the Respondents do not revoke its approval of the 2021 MS4 Permit,

24 Petitioner will be permanently required to comply with the illegal terms of the 2021 MS4 Permit

25 and will suffer the other harm set forth above.

26 125. Petitioner is entitled to a preliminary injunction and a permanent injunction

27 commanding the Regional Board to:
