INTRODUCTION

2 1. Under the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000

3 et seq. ["CEQA"), preservation of a quality environment is a matter of statewide concern.
4 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000, subd. (a).) The Legislature has mandated all state agencies to
5 give "major consideration" to preventing environmental damage when regulating activities
6 affecting the quality of the environment. (Kings Cty. Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990)
7 221 Cal. App. 3d 692, 710-11, quoting Pub. Resources Code, § 21000, subd. (g).)

8 2. This case arises from the March 3, 2021 decision of Respondent City of
9 Bakersfield ("City" or "Respondent") to adopt the Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND*') for
10 its Site Plan Review No. 20-102 ("SPR") and approval of a new Department of Veterans Affairs
11 ("VA") Clinic located at 5512 Knudsen Drive (the "Project"). Given the lack of appropriate
12 agency review, Petitioner PROGRESS FOR BAKERSFIELD VETERANS, LLC, a California
13 limited liability company ("Petitioner" or "PBV"), is seeking judicial review to ensure that
14 CEQA and all other applicable statutes, ordinances, and plans are enforced.
15 3. The Project would displace Bakersfield's existing VA clinic from its current
16 centralized location just west of downtown Bakersfield to an unsuitable former industrial site on

17 Knudsen Drive, located between a 7-11 and a self-storage facility, and adjacent to a future
18 planned Walmart store. In addition to being an inconvenient location, the proposed relocation of
19 the VA poses potential health concerns due to onsite contamination, as well as proximity to
20  other sources of air and other pollution. (See Exhibit A, Maps and Photos of Proposed Project
21 Location and Existing Bakersfield Veterans Affairs Clinic Location.)

22 4. As an alternative to relocating the existing VA Clinic, PBV, has proposed to
23 renovate and reuse the existing Westwind Drive facility with a modern, efficient layout and all
24 of the latest technology and equipment. The outpatient clinic proposed by PBV is on par with
25 the one proposed by Real Party in Interest SASD Development Group, LLC, a California

26 limited liability company ("SASD"), but would save taxpayers millions of dollars and could be
27 more quickly delivered to the veteran community. It would provide all of the same services as
28 proposed for the Knudsen Drive site, and be substantially bigger than the SASD proposal.

SOLURI
MESERVE 3
LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 PBV's as-new renovation of the existing clinic was designed by, and will be constructed by,

2 local Bakersfield companies and workers. This alternative could be completed a in a fraction of

3 the time and cost, and without causing significant impacts on the environment and posing
4 hazards to veterans. Using the existing VA site would also conserve natural resources and help

5 maintain the vitality of Bakersfield's existing commercial properties.

6 5. As a result of its rush to approve the VA Clinic relocation Project based on a
7 deficient MND, the City failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and thus prejudicially

8 abused its discretion, in violation of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines (Title 14, California Code
9 of Regulations, § 15000 et seq.).

10 6. An Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") is "the heart of CEQA" (CEQA
11 Guidelines, § 15003, subd. (a)), and its purpose is "to provide public agencies and the public in
12 general with detailed information about the effect which a proposed project is likely to have on
13 the environment; to list ways in which the significant effects of such a project might be
14 minimized; and to indicate alternatives to such a project." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21061; see
15 CEQA Guidelines, § 15003, subds. (b)-(e).) CEQA requires the preparation of an EIR where
16 there is substantial evidence, in light of the whole record before the lead agency, that a project
17 may have a significant effect on the environment. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21082.2, subd. (d).)
18 Because substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that the Project may cause
19 significant adverse effects on the environment, the City failed to proceed in the manner required
20 by law when it adopted the MND and approved the Project.
21 7. By approving the Project on the basis of the MND's flawed and fragmented
22 environmental analysis, the City made a decision without all of the information that it,

23 responsible and trustee agencies, and the public needed to properly weigh the consequences of
24 the City's approval of the Project. Prior to considering and approving the Project, the City
25 should have prepared and certified an EIR. As result of these failures, the City, responsible and
26 trustee agencies, and the public were deprived of the opportunity to consider mitigation and
27 alternatives that could have addressed the Project's adverse impacts, including, but not limited
28 to, renovating and reusing the existing VA facility location.

MESERVE 4

CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 8. In addition to violating CEQA, the City's approval of the Project on an industrially
2 zoned site via the SPR process also failed to comply with applicable City land use requirements,
3 including the City's General Plan and Zoning Code. Despite the inconsistency of the Project

4 with the applicable zoning for the site, SASD and/or the City have represented to the VA that

5 SASD's proposed displacement of the VA Clinic was in the M-2 Zone and that the property met

6 the VA's intended use.

7 PARTIES

8 9. Petitioner is a California limited liability company. PBV owns the outpatient
9 Iclinic currently operated by the VA located on Westwind Drive. PBV has significant concerns

10 regarding the integrity of the approval process undertaken for this Project, including both
11 adoption of the MND and approval of the SPR for the Project.
12 10. The principals of PBV own a significant amount of property in Bakersfield,
13 including multiple medical facilities, and have a strong commitment to the health and safety of
14 those who live or work in Bakersfield and the protection of the local environment. PBV has a
15 strong vested interest in ensuring that Bakersfield continues to be a place where people enjoy
16 living and doing business, and that the environment promotes their continued health and well-
17 being.

18 11. Respondent CITY OF BAKERSFIELD ("City" or "Respondent") is a charter city,
19 organized under the laws of the state of California, and exercising local government powers,
20 including land use authority. As the CEQA "lead agency" for the Project, the City is responsible
21 for preparation of an environmental document that describes the Project and its impacts and, if
22 necessary, evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid any significant
23 environmental impacts.

24 12. SASD is a limited liability company identified as the applicant in the Notice of
25 Determination filed by the City on March 8, 2021.
26 13. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest
27 DOES 1 through 20, and therefore names such Real Parties in Interest by fictitious names.
28 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based on such information and belief, alleges that the

SOLURI
MESERVE 5
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 fictitiously named Real Parties in Interest are also responsible for the actions described in this

2 Petition. When the true identities and capacities of DOES 1 through 20 have been determined,

3 Petitioner will seek leave from the Court to amend this Petition to insert such identities and

4 capacities.

5 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

6 14. The Project site was annexed to the City as part of a larger annexation in July
7 2012, and the established pre-zoning (M-2) was adopted upon annexation. The site is

8 surrounded on three sides (west, north and east) by land in unincorporated Kern County.

9 15. In January 2019, counsel for PBV submitted a written request for notification of
10 various actions associated with the Project, including all actions taken pursuant to CEQA.
11 16. In May 2020, SASD applied to the City for a SPR to develop a 39,648 square foot
12 medical outpatient clinic on approximately 9 acres in an M-2 (General Manufacturing) zone
13 district on Knudsen Drive, just south of the intersection with Olive Drive. Access to the site is

14 proposed through ingress/egress points along Knudsen Drive, Street 'A', and Landco Drive.

15 17. Without any notice to counsel for PBV, the City circulated an MND purporting to
16 review the Project on December 4, 2020. On December 31, 2020, upon learning of the
17 circulation of the MND for the Project, counsel for PBV requested that the public comment
18 period on the MND be extended for 30 calendar days and that the hearing on the MND be
19 continued to a date after the public comment period.
20 18. On January 7, 2021, PBV submitted comments on the inconsistency of the Project
21 with the City's Zoning Code and preliminary comments on the inadequacies of the MND, again
22 requesting extension of the MND comment period to allow meaningful public review of the

23 significant land use and other changes proposed for the site. In addition to providing specific
24 comments on numerous CEQA deficiencies, PBV's comments were supported by expert
25 opinion regarding the use of a potentially contaminated site for a VA Clinic. The expert stated
26 that "use of the property as a medical clinic should not be approved until after appropriate
27 testing of soil and groundwater on the property" and "strongly advis[ed] performing a phase II
28 site assessment to determine the potentially significant impacts of such land use."

MESERVE 6
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 19. On January 7, 2021, determining not to extend the comment period or continue the
2 hearing, the Planning Commission adopted the MND (Resolution No. 03-21).

3 20. On January 8, 2021, the Development Services Director approved the SPR for the

4 Project.

5 21. On January 15, 2021, Petitioner filed appeals of the Planning Commission's

6 decision to adopt the MND and the Development Services Director's approval of the SPR.

7 22. On February 4, 2021, the Planning Commission considered Petitioner's appeal of

8 the Development Services Director's approval of the SPR.

9 23. On February 12, 2021, Petitioner appealed the Planning Commission's decision to

10 uphold the approval of the SPR.

11 24. On March 1, 2021, PBV submitted detailed comments in support of its appeal of

12 the Planning Commissions adoption of the MND and approval of the SPR for the Project.
13 PBV's comments included updated expert opinion with respect to hazards and hazardous

14 materials impacts stating that "there is evidence of site contamination that could pose potentially
15 significant risks to human health and the environment." Expert opinion included in the letter

16 also identified potentially significant impacts associated with the Project's impacts on biological

17 resources, transportation and air quality. PBV's comments also described numerous other
18 deficiencies of the MND in detail, requesting that the City prepare a full EIR for the to ensure
19 proper analysis and mitigation of Project impacts.
20 25. On March 3, 2021, the City Council considered Petitioner's appeals of the

21 Planning Commission decision of January 7, 2021, to adopt the MND and the City Planning
22 Director's approval of the SPR. Without any discussion of the concerns raised by PBV, the City
23 Council concurred with the findings made by the Planning Commission on January 7. 2021,
24 denied the appeal and adopted the MND. The City Council found that the provisions of CEQA
25 and the City of Bakersfield CEQA Implementation Procedures were followed, that the Project

26 would not have the potential to cause a significant effect on the environment and that the Project
27 complies with the City's Zoning Code and development standards.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 26. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to

3 Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and

4 21168.5.

5 27. Venue is proper in the County of Kern under Code of Civil Procedure section 394.

6 28. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section
7 21167, subdivision (b). The City filed its Notice of Determination for the Project with the

8 County of Kern on March 8, 2021. (Citizens of Lake Murray Association v. City of San Diego
9 City Council (1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 436, 440-441 [the act of posting an NOD commences the

10 30-day limitations period for the filing of litigation].)

11 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

12 29. Petitioner has exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

13 Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to this filing and participated in the
14 administrative process. Petitioner actively participated in the administrative process leading up
15 to the City's approval of the Project and issuance of a notice of determination, and stated its

16 objections to the City's actions. (See Pub. Resources Code, § 21177, subd. (b).)

17 30. Respondent has taken final agency actions with respect to adopting the MND and

18 approving the Project. The City has a mandatory duty to comply with all state and federal laws,

19 including but not limited to CEQA and the Planning and Zoning Law, prior to undertaking the
20 discretionary actions at issue in this lawsuit.

21 STANDING

22 31. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because it has

23 health, safety, community and environmental interests that are directly and adversely affected by
24 the City's approval of the Project and adoption of the MND. Petitioner is within the class of
25 persons beneficially interested in, and aggrieved by, the acts of Respondent as alleged below.

26 32. Petitioner has a substantial interest in ensuring the Project's impacts are fully
27 mitigated. Unless the relief requested herein is granted, Petitioner's interests and the interests of
28 the community will be adversely affected and injured by the City's failure to comply with

SOLURI
MESERVE 8
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 CEQA in approving the Project and adopting the MND. The City's approval of the Project is

2 also a matter of public interest.

3 IRREPARABLE HARM

4 33. The City's failures, as set forth in this Petition, constitute a prejudicial abuse of

5 discretion within the meaning of the Code of Civil Procedure and CEQA. (See Code Civ. Proc.,

6 § 1094.5; Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.)

7 34. Petitioner possesses no other remedy than to challenge the City's abuse of

8 discretion than by means of this lawsuit. If the City's actions concerning the Project are
9 effectuated, Petitioner and the environment will be irreparably harmed. No money damages

10 could adequately compensate for that harm.

11 NOTICE OF CEQA SUIT

12 35. On April 6, 2021, Petitioner served a notice of Petitioner's intent to file this

13 lawsuit, pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5. (See Exhibit B, Notice of
14 Commencement of Action against the City of Bakersfield.)

15 REQUEST TO PREPARE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

16 36. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), and any
17 other applicable authority, Petitioner elects to prepare the record of proceedings in this action.

18 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

19 Violations of CEQA
20 (Public Resources Code, § 21000, et. seq.)
21 37. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates the allegations contained in
22 paragraphs 1 through 36, inclusive, of the Petition as if fully set forth herein.

23 38. CEQA applies to discretionary projects that are undertaken, funded, or approved
24 by public agencies. Under CEQA, a project may be approved based on an MND, rather than
25 an EIR, only if the initial study for the project that is circulated for public review and comment

26 indicates that all of the project's identified, potentially significant adverse effects have clearly

27 been mitigated to less than significant levels, and if no substantial evidence emerges through

28 the public review process that a project may have a significant effect.

SOLURI
MESERVE 9
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 39. In adopting the MND despite substantial evidence of a fair argument of
2 significant environmental impacts, the City failed to comply with the procedural mandates of

3 CEQA designed to ensure informed public decision-making. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21005.)

4 40. Petitioner submitted detailed comments substantiating the potentially significant

5 impacts of the Project and the inadequacy of mitigation measures provided to address those

6 impacts. Although the comments were clear, the City failed to adequately consider or respond
7 to comments prior to approving the Project in violation of CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15074,

8 subd. (b).)

9 41. An MND must include a complete, accurate description of the Project. (CEQA
10 § Guidelines, § 15071.) Among other defects, the MND's Project description was inadequate
11 due to its failure to describe the types of services that would be provided at the proposed VA
12 Clinic or the new drainage, power, wastewater and water systems required for the Project.
13 42. The setting information provided in the MND is inadequate, precluding adequate

14 environmental review in various resource areas including, but not limited to, the setting for the
15 following environmental impacts:

16 a. The MND fails to adequately describe the setting for biological resources,
17 containing no description of the site from a biological perspective, and no detection or
18 protocol surveys were performed for any of the special status species with potential to
19 occur on the site.

20 b. The MND fails to adequately describe the setting for land use impacts,
21 including the fact that the Project is not permitted by the existing zoning of the site, and
22 that a rezone would be necessary, with a proper a evaluation of the location of a VA

23 Clinic adjacent to land with an SI (Service Industrial) land use designation. The MND
24 also fails to disclose that the location of the Project, surrounded on three sides (west,
25 north and east) by land in unincorporated Kern County, could lead to growth inducing
26 impacts.

27 C. The MND also fails to describe the setting with respect to hazards and
28 hazardous materials, ignoring the complex history of the site and the immediately

SOLURI
MESERVE 10
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

A

2 surrounding area for industrial uses, including upgradient hazardous sites, as well as a

3 site history that includes oil production, and use as an automotive repair, dismantling, or
wrecking yard.

4 d.

5 The MND fails to provide setting information regarding key infrastructure

6 and its proximity to the Project site, including, CA-99, the railway, Beardsley Canal,

7 Kern River, Meadows Field Airport, Bakersfield Municipal Airport, and San Lauren

8 Elementary School. These facilities and their plans of operations have the potential to

9 be in conflict with the proposed Project, yet were left unanalyzed.
43. The MND failed to disclose, analyze and mitigate the proposed Project's direct,
10| indirect, and cumulative significant environmental impacts in violation of the substantive

11 mandates of CEQA.

12 44.

13 The Project would lead to significant site-specific, indirect and cumulative impacts

14 including, but not limited to, impacts associated with air quality, biological resources, tribal

15 cultural resources and geology/soils, energy, greenhouse gas emissions, hazards and hazardous

16 materials, hydrology/water quality, land use, noise, transportation/traffic, utility and utility

17 service systems, including fire safety and drainage systems. In addition, the City was required

18 to, but failed, to make mandatory findings of significance under CEQA Guidelines section
15065. The existence of a fair argument that these significant impacts may occur required
19 preparation of an EIR.

20 45.

21 The City prejudicially abused its discretion in approving the Project because

22 substantial evidence in the administrative record supports a fair argument that Respondent's

23 approval of the Project may result in one or more significant effects on various resource areas
including, but not limited to, the following impacts:

24 a.

25 The MND's discussion of air quality fails to consider potentially significant

26 air quality impacts, is based on inaccurate and outdated information regarding air quality

27 impacts, and fails to assess and analyze the public health risks associated with air

28 pollution from Project construction and operation. For example, the MND failed to
include any discussion of the potential health impacts from increased cancer risks for VA

SOLURI
MESERVE
A LAW 11

CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 patients in excess of Kern County and San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District

2 thresholds.

3 b. The MND's discussion of biological impacts is deficient, failing to account

4 for potentially significant impacts on biological resources, including, but not limited to,

5 impacts on burrowing owls, a special status species also protected by the Migratory Bird

6 Treaty Act with the potential to occur on the Project site; loss of avian productivity due to

7 habitat loss; Project impacts on wildlife movement; increase in wildlife roadkill as a

8 result of the Project; bird strikes from the Project's excessive use of glass windows on its

9 building façades; cumulative impacts from habitat fragmentation; and cumulative impacts
10 on species not covered by the Metropolitan Bakersfield Habitat Conservation Plan. As an
11 undeveloped area within an otherwise urbanized area, the site provides important habitat
12 values overlooked entirely in the MND.

13 C. The MND's analysis of impacts to tribal cultural resources and
14 geology/soils is inadequate. The MND identifies the potential presence of

15 "paleontological resources or unique geologic features" but then fails to adequately
16 assess these features at the site with a qualified expert; moreover, the MND relies on a
17 desktop records search performed by the applicant, as opposed to research performed by
18 a qualified expert, to determine that impacts to tribal cultural resources and geology/soils
19 are less than significant.

20 d. The MND fails to properly discuss and analyze the potentially significant
21 energy impacts generated by the construction of and operation of the Project, only briefly
22 discussing energy impacts of construction, and concluding that the impacts would be less
23 than significant. The MND provides no information of the adverse energy impacts from
24 construction, incorporation of renewable energy resources, energy use attributed to
25 vehicle trips associated with construction, the energy impacts associated with additional
26 square footage of the Project, and the designs by which the Project will undertake energy
27 efficiency. The MND also fails to consider whether energy impacts of the Project may be

2 avoided through alternate means, such as renovation, or LEED- certified efficiency
improvements.

3 e.

4 The MND fails to disclose the Project's Greenhouse Gas ("GHG") impacts,

5 claiming that "the impacts of this project are not considered significant given the efforts

6 made to reduce emissions of GHG from the project through design measures and

7 standards, plus further mitigation accomplished at the statewide level through California

8 Air Resources Board (CARB) regulations adopted pursuant to AB 32." The MND's

9 GHG analysis violates CEQA because it fails to establish that the project-level reduction

10 is consistent with reaching the State's current GHG-reduction goals. The MND was

11 required to acknowledge the relevance of the currently applicable law, SB 32, and should

12 have used the California Air Resources Board's 2017 Scoping Plan for guidance on
interpreting it, instead of the outdated 2014 Scoping Plan.
13 f.

14 The MND fails to disclose or analyze the hazards and hazardous materials

15 impacts associated with construction and operation of the Project on a site that likely

16 contains various hazards as a result of prior onsite uses and upgradient offsite sources.

17 The MND also fails to address whether the Project, as proposed, provides sufficient

18 emergency access to ensure the protection of life and property, and compliance with local

19 and regional emergency response plans. The MND also fails to disclose that the Project

20 is not an allowed use within Compatibility Area C of Meadows Field Airport, as shown

21 in the Kern County Airport Land Use Compatibility Plan, creating an unmitigated
hazards impact.

22 g.

23 The MND fails to disclose the hy drology/water quality impacts of the

24 a Project. As a drainage plan has not been prepared, the MND contains no specific

25 analysis of the Project's potentially significant hydrologic impacts, which are more

26 concerning due to contamination on and upgradient of the Project site. Without a

27 drainage plan, the MND's analysis was deficient and development of important Project
details were deferred to outside of the CEQA review process.

2 The MND fails to disclose the Project's land use impacts, claiming that the

3 Project a "is a permitted use within the M-2 (General Manufacturing) zone district, and is

4 consistent with the SI (Service Industrial) land use designation." The MND also fails to

5 analyze the Project's consistency with other required General Plan Elements, including

6 Environmental Justice and Air Quality elements, which are entirely missing from the

7 City's outdated General Plan. The City's determinations regarding the Project being a

8 permitted use on this M-2 zoned site are entirely without support in the Zoning Code and
skewed proper CEQA review of the Project's land use impacts.

10 The MND fails to contain Project-specific noise analysis, no information is

11 provided regarding existing noise levels in the Project vicinity, which has a General Plan

12 Land Use Designation of SI (Service Industrial) that includes uses involving outdoor

13 storage/use of heavy equipment described as uses that "produce significant air or noise

14 pollution and are visually obtrusive." In addition, the General Plan noise contours

15 referenced in the MND are entirely outdated. The noise analysis in the MND appears to

16 rely on a false assumption that application of "building codes for medical facilities" will
take into consideration noise" at some later date.

17 j.

18 The MND's analysis of transportation/traffic impacts contains inaccurate

19 information predicated on methods that are no longer used due to the change to Vehicle

20 Miles Travelled ("VMT*) approach to analysis, and fails to address public safety

21 concerns regarding access for emergency vehicles to the site. Despite an estimated

22 additional 1,511 trips per day into a site with only one entrance, the MND ignored the
potential for the Project to create transportation hazards.
23 k.

24 The MND's discussion of utility and service system impacts is inadequate.

25 While the MND claims that the "project would require the construction of new water,

26 storm water drainage, sewer facilities; above and/or belowground electrical facilities,

27 natural gas facilities, and telecommunications (e.g., cable, fiber optics, phone, etc.)

28 typical of residential development," the Project utility demands would logically be far in
excess of a "residential" development. The MND fails to provide any details on the

SOLURI
MESERVE
A LAW 14

CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

-

2 nature of the required construction, and no information is provided as to where existing

3 water, storm water, sewer, electrical, natural gas and telecommunications lines terminate.
Nor does the MND contain

4 any information regarding the need for supporting

5 infrastructure such as step-down transformers and pumping stations to meet Project
utility demands.

6 46.

7 The MND's cumulative impacts analysis in the Mandatory Findings of

8 Significance section is inadequate, stating only that "As described in the responses above, the

9 project has no impacts that would be defined as individually limited, but cumulatively

10 considerable." The MND does not include any discussion of the interaction between the

11 proposed Project and other past, present, and probable future projects producing related or

12 cumulative impacts. Among other cumulative impacts, other nearby development plans,

13 combined with the Project, could produce cumulatively significant effects not disclosed or
analyzed in the MND.

14 47.

15 The MND also failed to identify feasible mitigation measures to ensure reduction

16 of project impacts. The measures that are provided lack the detail and enforceability necessary

17 to adequately mitigate Project impacts. (See CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4.) Instead, the City

18 either impermissibly deferred mitigation or ignored its mitigation obligations entirely. As a

19 result, mitigation provided in the MND, along with the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting
Program ("MMRP"), will be ineffective in reducing potentially significant impacts to less than
20 significant levels. In addition, the MND and the MMRP fail to include the conditions applicable
21

22 to the Project even though the MND relies on these conditions to reduce Project impacts to less

23 than significant levels. (See Lotus v. Department of Transportation (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th

24 645, 655-57.) The City thus failed to reject or condition the project to avoid or minimize its
significant impacts as required by CEQA.
25 48.

26 The MND failed to adequately mitigate Project impacts, including, but not limited

27 to, mitigation for: air quality, biological resources, tribal cultural resources and geology/soils,

28 energy, greenhouse gas, hazards and hazardous materials, hydrology/water quality, land use,

SOLURI
MESERVE
A LAW 15

CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

noise, transportation/traffic, and utility and service system impacts. Examples of the MND's
2 failure to provide adequate, enforceable mitigation include:
3 a. With respect to air quality, the MND fails to require necessary mitigation,
4 defers specification of required mitigation measures, and fails to determine whether

5 emissions can successfully be reduced to less than significant levels.

6 b. With respect to biological resources, the MND failed to require basic
7 surveys for burrowing owls, California Species of Special Concern, instead only

8 including a condition to "generally require[] that Project-related disturbance at active
9 nesting territories be reduced or eliminated during the critical phases of the nesting
10 cycle." The MND also failed to incorporate specific mitigation measures identified by
11 the City's own consultant in the Biological Evaluation prepared for the Project.
12 C. With respect to tribal cultural resources and geology/soils, the mitigation
13 measures are inadequate to protect cultural resources, and paleontological and unique
14 geologic features. The MND delegates the evaluation assessment to a construction a

15 worker, and fails to use experts unless the worker makes and reports a discovery. The
16 mitigation provided leaves out "unique geologic features" and does not require the
17 special expertise needed to understand and protect those features from Project impacts.
18 d. With respect to energy, the MND fails to include mitigation to require

19 improved energy efficiency or renewable energy measures, referring only to "modern
20 building standards."
21 e. With respect to GHG emissions, the City failed to require the adoption of
22 all feasible GHG mitigation measures for the Project.

23 f. With respect to hazards and hazardous materials, the MND fails to include
24 mitigation to address potentially significant impacts from contamination on or near the
25 site, hazards due to inadequate emergency vehicle access, as well as hazards associated

26 with the Project's proximity to Meadows Field Airport.
27 g. With respect to hydrology and water quality impacts, the MND defers the
28 formulation of adequate mitigation to the later development of a drainage plan, and

SOLURI
MESERVE 16
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 leaving unaddressed the potentially significant hydrologic impacts associated with run-on
2 and run-off from the Project site.
3 h. With respect to land use impacts, the MND fails to include mitigation to
4 address the inconsistencies between the Project and the City's Zoning Code, nor requires
5 the necessary updates to the City's General Plan to make consistency findings for

6 environmental justice and air quality.

7 i. With respect to noise impacts, the MND fails to include mitigation to

8 address potentially significant noise impacts associated with the Project, deferring and

9 falsely assuming that building codes for medical facilities will address noise later.

10 j. With respect to transportation/traffic, the MND's reliance on participation
11 in the Regional Transportation Impact Fee Program and payment of Local Mitigation
12 Fees to mitigate the Project's significant cumulative and project-level transportation
13 impacts is inappropriate. The MND fails to provide specific information about the "fair
14 share" program to ensure that the payment of the impact fee is sufficiently tied to actual
15 mitigation and therefore effective. In addition, reliance on Conditions of Approval in lieu
16 of mitigation measures to conclude a less than significant impact fails to identify and
17 described the potential impacts of the proposed Project as required by CEQA.
18 k. With respect to utilities and service systems, the MND improperly relies on
19 the City's Subdivision & Engineering Design Manual to assume that the facilities would
20 not result in significant environmental effects. However, such compliance does not
21 eliminate the potential for direct and indirect utility and service system-related impacts.
22 49. The MND failed to disclose related environmental review and consultation
23 requirements of other local, state and federal jurisdictions, including tribal consultation and

24 trustee agencies, and to integrate those related requirements into CEQA review. (CEQA
25 Guidelines, § 15124, subd. (d)(1)(C).) The City failed to include information regarding other

26 local, state and federal regulatory and permitting regimes with authority over the Project in the
27 MND and failed to discuss and analyze how the Project will comport with the specific
28 environmental and other requirements of those regimes.

1 50. The City also failed to consult with all responsible and trustee agencies as required

2 by CEQA, and failed to provide those same agencies, along with "every other public agency

3 with jurisdiction by law over resources affected by the project," with notice and a copy of the
4 MND prior to adoption of the final MND as required by CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15063,

5 subd. (g); CEQA Guidelines, § 15073, subd. (e).)

6 51. The City's actions in adopting the MND and approving the Project violate CEQA.

7 Substantial evidence in the record, including evidence from other public agencies, technical

8 experts, and members of the public with knowledge and expertise concerning the environmental
9 issues raised herein, as well as substantial evidence in the City's own documents, demonstrate
10 that the City was required to prepare an EIR to comply with CEQA prior to considering
11 approval of the Project. (See Pub. Resources Code, § 21080, subds. (d), (e); CEQA Guidelines,

12 con 15070.)

13 52. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent failed to adopt legally adequate
14 mitigation for the Project and approved the Project with unmitigated impacts. Respondent

15 prejudicially abused its discretion by adopting an MND that does not comply with the
16 requirements of CEQA, and by failing to prepare an EIR for the Project.

17 53. CEQA requires a lead agency to apply its independent judgment to its adoption of
18 an MND. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21082.1, subd. (c).) The City's adoption of the MND does
19 not reflect the City's independent judgment because the City failed to consider substantial

20 evidence that supported a fair argument of significant impacts.
21 54. Respondent's decision to adopt the MND is invalid and an abuse of discretion
22 because its findings are not supported by evidence, its decision is not supported by the findings,
23 and it has not proceeded in the manner required by law as required by Public Resources Code
24 section 21081.

25 55. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent's adoption of the MND is

26 contrary to law and invalid and must be set aside.

2 Failure to Proceed in a Manner Required by Law
3 (Code Civ. Proc., 1094.5)
4 56. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates the allegations contained in
5 paragraphs through 55, inclusive, of the Petition as if fully set forth herein.
6 57. A Court's inquiry into the validity of an administrative decision extends to
7 whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion and whether the agency committed any
8 errors of law. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1094.5, subd. (b).)
9 58. Consistency with the City's General Plan relies on proper implementation of the
10 City's Zoning Code. (See Gov. Code, § 65860.)
11 59. An agency fails to proceed in a manner required by law when it relies on incorrect
12 legal information and misapplies governing legal authority for a land use decision. (William S.
13 Hart Union High Sch. Dist. v. Regional Planning Comm'n (1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1612, 1627.)
14 60. The City abused its discretion in finding that the Project conformed with the
15 City's adopted General Plan and Zoning Code, including but not limited to, consistency with the
16 site's zoning classification.
17 61. The purpose of the City's SPR process is to ensure development plans comply
18 with all applicable City development ordinances, standards, and policies.
19 62. The City prejudicially abused its discretion by approving the SPR based on a
20 demonstrably inaccurate Project description. A SPR application must include sufficient
21 information to determine whether the proposed project is consistent with the General Plan and
22 Zoning Ordinance and contains information necessary for CEQA review of the Project.
23 (Municipal Code, Ch. 17.08.080.)
24 63. The Project description in the City's staff reports and the MND failed to disclose
25 that the clinic would treat patients with contagious diseases, those suffering from drug and/or
26 alcohol abuse, as well as provide mental health services. Evidence before the City demonstrates
27 that these services were a condition of award of a contract by the VA to operate the Project.
28

SOLURI
MESERVE 19
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 64. The incomplete list of services to be provided at the Project resulted in a failure to
2 conduct a proper land use compatibility analysis and misapplication of the City's Zoning

3 Ordinance.

4 65. The City also abused its discretion by concluding that the Project is allowed, by

5 right, under the Property's M-2 - General Manufacturing Zone designation. Only the uses

6 specifically enumerated in the M-2 ordinance, or those "permitted uses" under the City's M-1-

7 Light Manufacturing Zone designation are allowed by right and solely require compliance with

8 the City's Zoning Ordinance. (See Municipal Code, Ch. 17.30.020, 17.04.494, italics added.)

9 66. The Project, when taking into account a complete, accurate description of the

10 services that will be provided, falls squarely within the use described under the M-1 ordinance

11 as "Clinics, hospitals, sanitariums or other buildings for contagious, mental, drug or liquor
12 addiction cases" which requires the issuance of a Conditional Use Permit ("CUP"). (See
13 Municipal Code, Ch. 17.28.030(A)(6), italics added.) The City lacks substantiation for its claim
14 that the use described in the M-1 ordinance only applies to services provided on an in-patient
15 basis. A plain language interpretation of the ordinance defeats this argument and the City's
16 purported practice of historically interpreting the ordinance in this way, even if true, is of no
17 legal consequence. (See Stockburger v. Jordon (1938) 10 Cal.2d 636, 648.)

18 67. The permitted uses within an M-1 - Light Manufacturing Zone include "any use
19 permitted in the C-O, C-1 and C-2 zones. (See Municipal Code, Ch. 17.28.020(A). Based
20 thereon, the City's improperly relied on one of the enumerated uses in a C-O- Professional and
21 Administrative Office Zone described as "medical, dental, psychiatric and other health
22 practitioner offices and clinics, including chiropractic, acupuncture, massage therapy and blood
23 banks" to determine that the Project complies with the applicable zoning provisions. (See
24 Municipal Code, Ch. 17.20.020(a)(21), italics added.) The City's conclusion in this regard fails
25 to take into account the subspecialty medical services that would be provided at the facility,
26 which constitutes a separate and distinct use addressed under the more intensive M-1 zone

27 designation and requires a CUP.

28

SOLURI
MESERVE 20
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 68. The more specific use described in the M-1 ordinance controls over the more

2 generalized use described in the less intensive C-O zoning designation, which the City

3 improperly relied upon. Because the Project's proposed use requires the issuance of a CUP, it

4 does not constitute a "permitted use," which is defined as a use by right by the City's Zoning

5 Ordinance. (See Municipal Code, §17.04.494.) The operation of a clinic that treats contagious,

6 mental, drug or liquor addiction cases is not a use allowed by right in a M-1 zone and, therefore,

7 is not a permitted use in a M-2 zone. Accordingly, the Project's approval in the absence of a
zone change and the issuance of CUP is violative of the City's land use regulations. (See

9 Code Civ. Proc., § 1859; Estate of Kramme (1978) 20 Cal.3d 567, 576.)
10 69. The City also abused its discretion in approving the SPR by failing to properly
11 analyze the Project's site plan in accordance with the law and its own development standards.
12 The site plan depicts Landco Drive as the only designated fire apparatus access road serving the
13 Project in violation of the California Fire Code, as adopted by the City. (See 24 CCR § 503.1.2;
14 Municipal Code, Ch. 15.65.010.) Furthermore, Landco Drive does not meet the requirements of
15 a dead-end fire apparatus road and fails to include an approved turnaround in accordance with

16 Fire Code standards. The conditions of approval do not otherwise require that the turnaround be
17 constructed in accordance with said standards. (See 24 Cal. Code Regs, § 503.2.5, App. D,
18 Table D103.4.)

19 70. The new roads, as configured on the approved site plan, also fail to provide the
20 Project with more than one independent means of access to the Project, posing a health and
21 safety risk. There is also nothing set forth in the conditions of approval that specifically require
22 the Project applicant to complete construction of all on-site and off-site improvements, including

23 the roads.

24 71. Finally, the City failed to proceed in a manner required by law when adopting the

25 inadequate MND in support of the Project, constituting an abuse of discretion.

26 72. For the foregoing reasons, the City prejudicially abused its discretion with respect
27 to its approval of the Project because the Project and its approval by the City are inconsistent
