VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 Petitioners, Fall River Conservancy (the "Conservancy") and California Trout

2 ("CalTrout") (collectively, "Petitioners") hereby petition this Court for a writ of mandate against

3 Respondents, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (the "Department") and the

4 California Fish and Game Commission (the "Commission") (collectively, "Respondents"), and

5 for their petition allege as follows:

6 INTRODUCTION

7 1. This action challenges and seeks to set aside certain amendments to Statewide

8 Inland Trout Regulations (SCH No. 2020090186, "Simplification of Statewide Inland Sport

9 Fishing") adopted by the Commission on October 14, 2020 (the "Regulations") as they pertain to

10 (i) the Fall River, one of the largest spring-fed river systems in the Western United States, and its
11 tributaries (the "Fall River Complex" or "Complex") including its distinct species of rainbow
12 trout, and (ii) to its tributary Bear Creek, without conducting sufficient environmental review as

13 required under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code

14 § 21,000, et. seq.

15 2. During the administrative and environmental review process for the Regulations,

16 several parties, including the Conservancy and CalTrout, provided written comments to

17 Respondents that the Regulations as proposed and ultimately adopted were insufficient and would

18 lessen environmental protections, resulting in potentially significant negative impacts to the

19 unique Fall River Complex and Bear Creek if implemented. They also commented that additional

20 scientific study - including a sufficient analysis of baseline conditions, adequate disclosure of

21 potential significant impacts, and development and adoption of mitigation measures - was needed

22 to comply with CEQA and protect the Fall River Complex and Bear Creek, and the fish

23 populations therein, before such regulations should be considered for adoption.

24 3. For purposes of environmental review under CEQA and the State CEQA

25 Guidelines (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15000, et seq.), the Commission relied on an unsupported and

26 inadequate Negative Declaration without any study of potential adverse environmental impacts to

27 the Fall River Complex and Bear Creek that could occur if the Regulations were adopted and

28 implemented.
-1-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

4. Petitioners contend that Respondents violated CEQA and committed a prejudicial

2 abuse of discretion by: (i) failing to proceed in the manner required by law; (ii) failing to apply

3 the proper legal standards; (iii) adopting findings that are insufficient to support their decisions;

4 (iv) making findings that are not supported or justified by substantial evidence in the

5 administrative record; and (v) failing to make other necessary findings.

6 5. a Accordingly, this Court should issue a writ of mandate directing Respondents to

7 set aside and vacate the Regulations applicable to the Fall River Complex and Bear Creek as
alleged herein. Petitioners further seek a court-ordered stay of those portions of the Regulations
pending resolution of this lawsuit, in order to protect the sensitive and unique fish populations,

10 including important long-living and irreplaceable broodstock, and conditions in the Fall River

11 Complex and related areas from irreparable harm.

12 PARTIES

13 6. The Conservancy is a California non-profit corporation founded in 2008 with the

14 mission of preserving lands and waters of the Northern California's Fall River Valley and

15 conserving the Valley's wildlife and biological resources, including the functioning cold-water
16 spring systems that support and protect robust populations of large, healthy trout. Conservancy

17 members include many long-time landowners in and around the Fall River Mills community, and
18 the Conservancy has a significant and direct interest in the continued health and vitality of the
19 unique and genetically distinct fish populations occurring in the Fall River Complex and Bear
20 Creek that could be adversely and directly affected by the Regulations.

21 7. CalTrout is a California conservation non-profit corporation incorporated in 1971,

22 with the mission of ensuring that wild fish thrive in healthy waters for a better California through

23 watershed stewardship, science-based solutions, and other measures. CalTrout operates through

24 six regional offices, including the Mount Shasta/Klamath region that includes the Fall River

25 Complex and Bear Creek, as well as an office in Sacramento that engages in legislative and

26 administrative policy matters with many agencies of the State of California, including
27 Respondents. Among other things, CalTrout participates in many "boots on the ground"

28 conservation projects designed to protect and promote healthy waters and fish populations for the

- 2 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

public benefit in California. In June 2020, CalTrout issued its formal comment letter concerning

2 the proposed Regulations in order to raise concerns about adequately protecting native trout

3 species and sensitive wild trout fisheries from unnecessary impacts associated with increased

4 harvest or angling pressure.

5 8. The Department is a state agency charged with public trust responsibilities for

6 protecting and managing the State's fish and wildlife. Among other things, the Department

7 implements and enforces the regulations established by the Commission and provides biological
data and expertise to inform the Commission's decision-making process.

9 9. The Commission is a state agency charged with the public trust responsibilities for

10 protecting and managing the State's fish and wildlife. Among other things, the Commission has

11 responsibility for promulgating regulations to manage sport fishing, including seasons, bag limits,

12 methods of take, and other subjects.

13 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

14 10. This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to the California

15 Constitution, Article VI, § 10, Code of Civil Procedure §§ 88, 1060, and 1094.5, or in the

16 alternative § 1085.

17 11. Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § § 393 and 395.
18 12. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to filing this action including

19 exhaustion of administrative remedies to the extent required by law and complying with notice

20 provisions of Public Resources Code §§ 21167.5 (Exhibit A hereto) and 21167.7 (Exhibit B

21 hereto).

22 13. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code

23 § 21167.6 by concurrently filing a request concerning preparation of the record of administrative

24 proceedings relating to this action.

25 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

26 14. Commencing in 2018, the Department proposed changes to California inland trout
27 angling regulations for approval by the Commission with a stated purpose "to eliminate or reduce

28

- 3 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

the sport fish harvest" and "to protect populations of threatened trout."
2 (https://ceganet.opr.ca.gov/2020090186/2.

3 15. The Department and the Commission conducted community meetings in 2018 and

4 2019 to discuss proposed changes to amend and simplify inland sport fishing regulations.

5 16. In June 2020, the Commission approved a formal notice of proposed rulemaking.

6 The Commission's rulemaking and regulatory process is governed by the California

7 Administrative Procedure Act ("APA"). The APA requires public participation in the adoption of

8 State regulations to ensure they are necessary and legally valid, among other things.

9 17. For purposes of CEQA, the staff of the Commission published a proposed

10 Negative Declaration on or about September 9, 2020 for a 30-day public review and comment

11 period.

12 18. During that review and comment period, several commenters stated that the

13 Negative Declaration and the Regulations did not consider or rely on the best available science or

14 adequate scientific study to inform and support adoption of the Regulations, including

15 identification of potential negative impacts through the proposed changes to the Regulations. The

16 comments included that the Department, in concert with the Conservancy, CalTrout, and the

17 University of California at Davis ("U.C. Davis") Center for Watershed Sciences, had conducted

18 annual mark-recapture surveys and genetic research on the trout population in the Fall River

19 Complex which indicated (among other things) that a significant portion of spawning fish in Bear

20 Creek reside in the Fall River and are genetically distinct from their counterparts throughout the

21 complex. That evidence demonstrated that the Regulations, which would lessen existing

22 protections of the fish populations, posed a potentially significant risk to the spawning season and

23 biodiversity in the Fall River Complex and Bear Creek, and that potential impact did not receive
24 the necessary level of environmental review under CEQA.

25 19. For those reasons, among others, CalTrout and the Conservancy opposed the
26 Regulations for the Fall River Complex and Bear Creek as posing significant adverse impacts

27 including by (i) altering the current fishing season, and (ii) removing the 14-inch maximum limit

28 on to trout to protect larger spawning broodstock. Petitioners also requested that the Commission

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 adopt a unified regulation to adequately protect the genetically distinct trout in the Fall River

2 Complex and Bear Creek, given (i) the inadequate population surveys and (ii) the latest scientific

3 and genetic information from UC Davis.

20. The Conservancy, CalTrout and others submitted timely public comments during

5 the public review period concerning the potential environmental impacts of the Regulations in

6 relaxing restrictions in the Fall River Complex. For example, on September 29, 2020, the

7 Conservancy submitted a letter to the Commission concerning the impact of the Regulations on

8 the Fall River, emphasizing that the Fall River presents a unique and high-quality angling

9 experience. These comments noted that under the protection of existing regulations, the Fall

10 River Complex fishery has sustained a robust trout population that could be significantly and

11 adversely impacted by the Regulations. The Conservancy requested that the Fall River Complex

12 be protected by a zero-bag limit and a requirement for artificial flies or lures with barbless hooks,

13 among other things. It also stated that the best available science, including the passive integrated
14 transponder ("PIT") project, favored retaining the status quo in the Fall River and in the

15 vulnerable upper spawning reaches.

16 21. On September 30, 2020, CalTrout, a leader in conservation of salmonids across

17 California for decades, submitted a letter to the Commission expressing concerns with the

18 Regulations' impacts on sensitive native and wild trout. Among other things, CalTrout stated that
19 the proposed Regulations would not adequately protect wild trout fisheries or meet stated

20 management objectives, including in the Fall River fishery, and requested the use of barbless,

21 artificial lures a only with a zero fish daily bag.

22 22. On October 14, 2020, the Commission held an online public meeting to consider

23 the Regulations and took action to approve the Regulations, without conducting any scientific

24 study or adopting any of the recommendations proposed by Petitioners and others.

25 23. On or about November 5, 2020, the Commission issued a notice to clarify the

•26 regulatory language that was adopted.

27 24. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that the Regulations

28 were submitted by the Commission to the Office of Administrative Law ("OAL") for review and

- 5 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

approval, and that the OAL approved the Regulations, which took effect on or about March 1,

2 2021.

3 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

(Writ of Mandate, CCP § 1094.5 and/or § 1085)

5 25. Petitioners incorporate by reference and re-allege the allegations of paragraphs 1-

6 24, above.

7 26. Pursuant to CEQA, public agency may not adopt a Negative Declaration if there

8 is substantial evidence in the record such that it could be "fairly argued" that the project may have
a significant effect on the environment. Sierra Club v. California Dept. of Forestry and Fire

10 Protection (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 370, 380-381; Keep our Mountains Quiet v. County of Santa

11 Clara (2015) 236 Cal.App.4th 714 (residents' personal knowledge qualifies as substantial

12 evidence). A court must reject a Negative Declaration even if there is also substantial evidence in

13 the record that the project would not have adverse environmental effects. Keep our Mountains

14 Quiet, supra, 236 Cal.App.4th at 732; Sierra Club, supra, 150 Cal.App.4th at 380-381 ("if

15 substantial evidence establishes a reasonable possibility of a significant environmental impact,

16 then the existence of contrary evidence in the administrative record is not adequate to support a

17 decision to dispense with an EIR [Citations]").

18 27. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion and violated CEQA in adopting

19 the Regulations without adequate environmental review, including the lack of any baseline

20 studies of current conditions in the Fall River Complex and Bear Creek., which are unique and

21 sensitive geographic areas that warrant such study and consideration. For the reasons given in

22 public comment letters, including those submitted by Petitioners, the Commission failed to study

23 the potentially significant adverse impacts that could result from implementing the Regulations
24 and their lessening of protections, and failed to give sufficient consideration to (i) protecting the

25 Fall River Complex with a zero-bag limit or at least a limitation that larger fish (over 14 inches)

26 not be harvested, a requirement for artificial flies or lures with barbless hooks to prevent high

27 mortality and injury rates, and a limited (status quo) fishing season from the last Saturday in April

28 to November 15th to the extent feasible; and (ii) adopting a unified regulation to adequately

- 6-
VERIFIEI PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 protect the genetically distinct trout in the Fall River Complex and Bear Creek given the

2 inadequate population surveys and the latest scientific information from U.C. Davis.

3 28. Respondents' responses to public comments, including the comments by the

4 Conservancy and CalTrout, were inadequate under CEQA.

5 29. For the same reasons, Respondents' actions also violated duties under the Fish and

6 Game Code (for example, § 203.1, "the commission shall consider populations, habitat, food

7 supplies, the welfare of individual animals"; § 219(a), "the regulation is necessary for the

8 protection of fish, wildlife, and other natural resources under the jurisdiction of the commission").

30. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy at law to correct the errors

10 and abuse of discretion committed by Respondents other than through the relief sought by this

11 Petition.

12 31. Accordingly, Petitioners seek a determination and judgment that Respondents

13 committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion by failing to proceed in the manner required by law,

14 that their decisions are not supported by their findings, and the findings are not supported by

15 substantial evidence in the record.

16 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

17 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for entry of judgment as follows:

18 32. For a stay pending resolution of this lawsuit of those portions of the Regulations

19 applicable to the Fall River Complex and Bear Creek;

20 33. For a judgment that Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and

21 failed to comply with CEQA and the Fish and Game Code as alleged herein;

22 34. For a peremptory writ of mandate setting aside the Regulations with respect to the

23 Fall River Complex and Bear Creek as alleged herein, and directing Respondents to comply with

24 their duties under CEQA and the Fish and Game Code as directed by the Court before seeking to

25 amend the Regulations applicable to those areas;

26 35. For costs of suit;

27 36. For attorneys' fees as authorized by Code of Civil Procedure 1021.5 and any

28 other applicable law; and

- 7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 37. For such other relief as the Court finds just and proper.
