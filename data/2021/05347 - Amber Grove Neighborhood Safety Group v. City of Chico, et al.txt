2. The Greenfield and Esplanade Apartments would be built in a large currently
2 empty lot adjacent to a single family, single story residential neighborhood. Certain portions of

3 the Project may have views into the back yards of several nearby houses, as well as a Skyway

4 House 24-hour residential alcohol and drug treatment facility, separated only by a chain link

5 fence.

6 3. The vehicle access for all of the new apartment residents would be through a

7 driveway located near an unsignalized intersection of Greenfield Drive off of Esplanade Drive.

8 Esplanade Drive is a busy street, and members of the public have reported that under existing
9 conditions, it is often difficult to turn left onto Greenfield Drive, as well as to turn left off of

10 Greenfield Drive onto Esplanade Drive.

11 4. While the City approved the Project under the Class 32 infill development project
12 exemption from environmental review under the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub.
13 Resources Code, § 21000 et seq ["CEQA"]), the CEQA Guidelines section 15332 exemption is

14 inapplicable. The City determined that there was no reasonable possibility of significant effect
15 on environment, yet the Project would, in fact, result in potentially significant impacts on the
16 environment. Thus, the City erred in relying on an exemption from CEQA to forego all CEQA
17 review.

18 5. The City also wrongly a processed the Project as a "housing development project"
19 under the Housing Accountability Act (Gov. Code, § 65589.5 I'HAA"]). Under the HAA, the

20 City cannot deny or reduce the density of a housing development project that meets "applicable,

21 objective general plan, zoning, and subdivision standards and criteria" except when the project
22 would have a "specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety unless the project is
23 disapproved or approved upon the condition that the project be developed at a lower density."
24 The Project does not meet the General Plan criteria and would also have specific, adverse
25 impacts upon public health and safety.

26 6. Petitioner seeks a peremptory writ of mandate invalidating the City's approval of
27 the Project since, as more fully set forth below, the City has violated CEQA as well as its own

28

2 public health and safety.

3 PARTIES

4 7. Petitioner AMBER GROVE NEIGHBORHOOD SAFETY GROUP is an

5 unincorporated association of Chico residents, business owners, and property owners concerned

6 about preserving the environment and character of the neighborhood in the vicinity of the

7 Project. AMBER GROVE NEIGHBORHOOD SAFETY GROUP was formed after the City's

8 approval of the Project and includes members of the public who participated in the City's
9 Project review process. Linda Reichello, a resident who filed an appeal of the Planning

10 Commission's approval of the Project, is a member of AMBER GROVE NEIGHBORHOOD

11 SAFETY GROUP.

12 8. Respondent CITY OF CHICO ("City" or "Respondent") is a charter city,
13 organized under the laws of the state of California, and exercising local government power,
14 including land use authority. As the CEQA "lead agency" for the Project, the City is responsible
15 for preparation of an environmental document that describes the Project and its impacts and, if
16 necessary, evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid any significant
17 environmental impacts.

18 9. Real Parties in Interest GARRET GILLILAND, an individual, and CALIFORNIA

19 CODES, LLC, a limited liability corporation, are identified as the applicants in the Notice of
20 Exemption filed by the City on March 5, 2021 for the Project.

21 10. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents DOES 1

22 through 10, and Real Parties in Interest DOES 11 through 20, and sue such respondents by

23 fictitious names. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on the basis of such information and

24 belief allege, that the fictitiously named respondents and real parties are also responsible for the

25 actions described in this Petition. When the true identities and capacities of these respondents

26 and real parties have been determined, Petitioners will amend this Petition, with leave of Court

27 if necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.

BACKGROUND FACTS

2 11. The Greenfield and Esplanade Apartments would be located at the corner of

3 Greenfield Drive off of Esplanade Drive in the City of Chico on a 3.13 acre lot. The Project

4 includes 62 units, and 60 of those would be located within the main apartment building. Two

5 units would be located within a two-story amenity building, and there would also be a one-story

6 café building nearest to the intersection. The Project would include 128 parking spaces for

7 vehicles and 12 parking spaces for bicycles.
8 12. The Amber Grove neighborhood surrounds the Project on three sides. There is a

9 total of 607 homes within neighborhood, bordered by Eaton Road to the North, Esplanade to the

10 East and the Shasta Union Drainage Assessment District canal to the West and South. This

11 neighborhood has been established over the past 20 years and is centered around Peterson Park.
12 There are only four entrances to the neighborhood, with three off of Esplanade Drive and one

13 off of Eaton Road. The Project site borders the Greenfield Drive entrance to the neighborhood.

14 13. The Ray Morgan corporate headquarters is located directly across the street from
15 the Project. The Ray Morgan site has approximately 70 employees, and is also visited by semi-

16 trucks enter Greenfield Drive for delivery. These trucks often use the Greenfield Drive and

17 Eagle Lake intersection for a turnaround, which is adjacent to the Project's proposed entrance

18 driveway.

19 14. The Project applicant listed on the Use Permit 20-02 application was California

20 Codes, LLC, and was submitted by Buddy Williams. The recorded owner of the property is

21 COB Enterprises, LLC.

22 15. City staff submitted the application for approval of Use Permit 20-02 by the City's

23 Planning Commission at its meeting on November 5, 2020, with a recommendation of approval

24 of the and finding that the Project is exempt from CEQA review under the infill development

25 exemption found in CEQA Guidelines section 15332.

26 16. With respect to the applicability of the Class 32 infill housing exemption, the City

27 staff report stated that: the Project is consistent with the General Plan and zoning; is on a site of

28 less than five acres within the City limits; is substantially surrounded by urban uses; has no

CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

value as habitat for endangered, rare, or threatened species; would not create any significant

2 effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality; and would be served by all required

3 utilities and public services.

4 17. Members of the public, including members of Amber Grove, provided detailed

5 testimony about the Project's potentially significant impacts on the environment and adverse

6 impacts upon the public health or safety, and asked the City Planning Commission and City

7 Council to properly review the Project before taking action.

8 18. Real Party in Interest Garret Gilliland appeared at the Planning Commission as the

9 applicant. Mr. Gilliland was formerly a principal in a firm called Nor-Cal Innovative

10 Investments. In 2012, Mr. Gilliland was sentenced in federal court to seven years and 10

11 months in prison and three years of supervised release for his role in a mortgage fraud scam in
12 Chico that that began in 2006, ran for about two years and involved some 70 newly constructed

13 houses that were sold, for the most part, to buyers who didn't exist for greatly inflated prices

14 using mortgage lenders from out of the area. The prosecution of Mr. Gilliland for mortgage

15 fraud gained international attention and was the product of an investigation by the Federal

16 Bureau of Investigation; the Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation; and the Butte
17 County District Attorney's Office's Major Crimes Unit.

18 19. Despite the concerns of the interested public regarding the Project and its

19 environmental and other impacts, the Planning Commission unanimously approved Use Permit
20 20-02 (Greenfield and Esplanade Apartments), authorizing a multi-family residential use on a

21 site zoned OR (Office Residential) at its November 5, 2020 meeting. With 62 units on 3.13

22 acres, the Project is just at the maximum density allowed 20 units per gross acre for an Office
23 Mixed Use (OMU) zone.

24 20. Linda Reichello filed a timely administrative appeal of the Planning Commission's

25 action on November 16, 2020, citing objections related to public noticing, traffic safety, project
26 design, and existing maintenance districts, among other issues.

27 21. The City's appeal hearing was held on March 2, 2021. Ms. Reichello and other

28 members of the public presented testimony at the appeal hearing explaining how the Project was

SOLURI
MESERVE 6
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

1 not consistent with the General Plan and how it would result in potentially significant impacts

2 on the environment. The fact that the Project applicant had deferred design review of the

3 Project's architectural style by the Architectural Review and Historic Preservation Board was

4 also discussed at the meeting.

5 22. After discussion among the Council members, the appeal was denied on a 3-2

6 vote, and the City approved CUP 20-04 and authorizing the Project, which constituted final

7 agency action.

8 23. On March 5, 2021, the City filed its notice of exemption for the Project with the

9 County of Butte.

10 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

11 24. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to

12 Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code sections 21168.

13 25. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the County of Butte
14 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394.

15 26. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section
16 21167, subdivision (d).

17 STANDING

18 27. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims alleged in this Petition because

19 Petitioner is beneficially interested in this matter, as required by Code of Civil Procedure
20 section 1086. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because its

21 members include residents, business owners and property owners within the City of Chico and
22 have personal and community interests that are directly and adversely affected by the City's

23 approval of the Project. Petitioner is within the class of persons beneficially interested in, and

24 aggrieved by, the acts of Respondent as alleged below. Petitioner and its members have a

25 beneficial interest in challenging the City's unlawful approval of the Project that will negatively

26 impact the environmental and public health in the City of Chico.
27 28. The City's approval of the Project is also a matter of public interest. Petitioner

28 and its members participated in the administrative processes herein, and exhausted its remedies.

SOLURI
MESERVE 7
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

Accordingly, Petitioner has standing to sue.

2 IRREPARABLE HARM

3 29. The City's failures, set forth in this Petition, constitute a prejudicial abuse of

4 discretion within the meaning of the Code Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and CEQA. (See

5 Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5; Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.)

6 30. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.

7 If the City's actions regarding the Project are effectuated, Petitioner and the community will be

8 irreparably harmed. No money damages could adequately compensate for that harm.

9 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

10 31. Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil

11 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights

12 affecting the public interest.

13 32. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit on

14 the general public by requiring the City to comply with CEQA, its General Plan and the HAA

15 when making land use decisions.

16 33. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will also result in the enforcement

17 of important rights affecting the public interest by requiring the City to comply with CEQA and

18 the HAA and thereby protect the environment in the city of Chico.

19 NOTICE OF CEOA SUIT

20 34. On April 7, 2021, Petitioner served a notice of Petitioner's intent to file this

21 lawsuit, pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5. (See Exhibit A, Notice of
22 Commencement of Action against the City of Chico.)

23 ELECTION TO PREPARE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

24 35. Pursuant to Public Resources Code, section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), and any
25 other applicable authority, Petitioner elects to prepare the record of proceedings in this action.

26 36. Pursuant to this election, Petitioner requests that Respondent, upon service of this

27 election, gather and transmit its administrative files to Petitioner for preparation of the

28 administrative record. Respondent is required to provide its administrative files free of charge.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
Violations of CEQA

2 (Public Resources Code, § 21000, et. seq.)

3 37. Petitioners incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in

4 Paragraphs 1 through 36 as though fully set forth herein.

5 38. The City did not perform environmental review for the Project pursuant to

6 CEQA. Instead, the City found the Project exempt from CEQA review pursuant to the "infill
7 development" categorical exemption. By relying on this exemption, the City failed to proceed

8 in a manner required by law.

9 39. The infill development categorical exemption is subject to exceptions under
10 which reliance on an exemption is improper. The infill exemption (and other categorical

11 exemptions) may not be relied on when there is a "reasonable possibility that the activity will

12 have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." (CEQA

13 Guidelines, § 15300.2, subd. (c); see, e.g., Voices for Rural Living v. El Dorado Irrigation

14 District (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1096, 1109 [reliance on an exemption precluded].)

15 40. Evidence presented to the City during the course of Project review indicated that

16 the Project would not comply with all applicable General Plan designations and policies and all

17 applicable zoning designations and regulations. In addition, approval of the Project would

18 result in potentially significant effects, including but not limited to effects relating to aesthetics,

19 air quality, land use, noise, recreation, transportation and water quality.

20 41. To the extent the City intends to rely on the adopted Project conditions to reduce

21 the significant impacts of the Project, those conditions are akin to mitigation, and a lead agency

22 may not rely on mitigation to qualify for a categorical exemption. (CEQA Guidelines, §
23 15126.4, subd. (a)(1)(A); Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004)

24 125 Cal.App.4 1098.)

25 42. The City prejudicially abused its discretion by exempting the Project from

26 environmental review under CEQA, as substantial evidence in the record indicates there is a

27 reasonable possibility of numerous potentially significant environmental impacts, including but

28 not limited to:

SOLURI
MESERVE 9
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

a. Aesthetics. The Project would a have a significant aesthetic impact because

2 it does not conform to the surrounding neighborhood. In addition, the

3 Project would introduce a new source of light and glare that would
4 adversely affect views in the area.
b. Air Quality. The Project would result in additional emissions, including

6 toxic air contaminants, from construction and traffic generated by 62 new

7 housing units located near sensitive receptors.

8 C. Cultural Resources. No assessment of the potential for cultural,
9 archeological or paleontological resources was performed for the Project.
10 To the extent Condition of Approval 8 purports to provide mitigation for
11 potentially significant impacts to cultural, archeological or paleontological
12 resources, a lead agency may not rely on mitigation to qualify for a
13 categorical exemption.

14 d. Biological Resources. There is no support for the City's finding that the
15 Project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened

16 species without conducting any site-specific review. In addition,
17 Condition of Approval 5 requires mitigation for removal of trees from the
18 site. A lead agency may not rely on mitigation to qualify for a categorical

19 exemption. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4, subd. (a)(1)(A).)
20 e. Land Use. The City erred in finding that the Project was consistent with

21 the General Plan. Evidence in the record indicates that the Project is

22 inconsistent with several General Plan policies, including, but not limited
23 to: maintaining neighborhood compatibility by maintaining neighborhood

24 character (LU-4.3, LU-2.4, CD-5.1) and context sensitive design (LU-4.3

25 and CD-5.3). To the extent that the a City relies on a future Architectural

26 and Design Review process to mitigate lead agency may not rely on
27 mitigation to qualify for a categorical exemption. (CEQA Guidelines, §

28 15126.4, subd. (a)(1)(A).)

SOLURI
MESERVE 10
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

/

1 f. Recreation. The Project would increase demand for recreational amenities

2 in the Project area., which has not been analyzed.

3 g. Transportation/Traffic. The addition of 62 new units to a street with no
4 stoplight or other measures at the intersection of Esplanade Drive and

5 Greenfield Drive would create significant transportation hazards to

6 existing and future residents and workers in the area. In addition, the site

7 plan provides inadequate access for emergency vehicles to the site.

8 43. Cumulative Impacts. The infill exemption (and other categorical exemptions) are

9 inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same
10 place, over time is significant. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15300.2, subd. (b).) The Project would

11 result in cumulatively significant impacts on aesthetic, cultural, land use, noise, traffic

12 resources, among other impacts.

13 44. As there is a reasonable possibility that the Project would have a significant effect

14 on the environment due to unusual circumstances, the City failed to proceed in the manner

15 required by law when it relied on an exemption from CEQA for the Project.

16 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
17 Failure to Proceed in a Manner Required by Law

18 (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5; Gov. Code, §§ 65000, 65589.5)

19 45. Petitioners incorporate by reference each and every allegation contained in
20 Paragraphs 1 through 44 as though fully set forth herein.
21 46. A Court's inquiry into the validity of an administrative decision extends to
22 whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion and whether the agency committed
23 any errors of law. (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1094.5, subd. (b).)
24 47. Consistency with the City's General Plan relies on proper implementation of
25 the City's Zoning Code. (See Gov. Code, § 65860.)
26 48. An agency fails to proceed in a manner required by law when it relies on incorrect
27 legal information and misapplies governing legal authority for a land use decision. (William S.
28 Hart Union High Sch. Dist. V. Regional Planning Comm'n (1991) 226 Cal.App.3d 1612, 1627.)

;

1 49. The site is designated Office Mixed Use on the City's General Plan Land Use

2 Diagram and is zoned OR-AOD-COS (Office Residential within Airport Overflight Zone D and

3 Corridor Opportunity Site overlays).

4 50. The City abused its discretion in findings that the Project conformed with the

5 City's adopted General Plan and Zoning Code.

6 51. In fact, the proposed project is inconsistent with the City's General Plan goals and

7 policies, including but not limited to, maintaining neighborhood compatibility by maintaining

8 neighborhood character (LU-4.3, LU-2.4, CD-5.1) and context sensitive design (LU-4.3 and

9 CD-5.3). The Building does not conform to the surrounding neighborhood and is not designed

10 in manner sensitive to the neighborhood context, which includes single story, single family

11 homes and a Skyway House 24-hour residential alcohol and drug treatment facility.

12 52. The City abused its discretion when it found that pursuant to Government Code

13 section 65589.5:

14 The proposed use would not be detrimental to the health, safety, or welfare of
15 persons residing or working in the neighborhood as the proposed residential use is compatible with the existing surrounding residential uses[;l
16 The proposed residential use is compatible with the existing surrounding residential uses, and with the surrounding commercial and institutional uses; and
17 The proposed use would not be detrimental and/or injurious to property and improvements in the neighborhood of the proposed use, or to the general welfare
18 of the City.

19 53. As a result of the Project's inconsistency with core General Plan policies, the City

20 failed to proceed in a manner required by law when it found that the Project conformed with the

21 General Plan and issued Use Permit 20-02.

22 PRAYER
