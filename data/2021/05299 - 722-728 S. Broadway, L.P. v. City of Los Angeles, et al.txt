PETITION AND COMPLAINT

Petitioner/plaintiff 722-728 S. Broadway, L.P., a California limited partnership

2 ("Petitioner"), hereby pelitions this Court for a peremptory writ of mandate/mandamus, pursuant

3 to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, to be directed to respondents/defendants the

4 City of Los Angeles ("City") and its City Council, along with other causes of action alleged

5 herein, including as to the applicant and real party in interest BRIDGE Housing Corporation, a

6 California nonprofit public benefit corporation ("Applicant"), and real party in interest Los

7 Angeles County Development Authority ("Owner"). This petition/complaint alleges conduct in

8 violation of the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21000-

9 21189.57) ("CEQA").

10 THE PARTIES

11 1. Petitioner is a California limited partnership is and is the fee owner of the properties

12 8517-8521 S Vermont (APN 6033-026-013), 8529 S Vermont (APN 6033-026-014), and 1057-

v 83A3WM3N 13 1059 W Manchester Ave (APN 6033-026-022) in the City of Los Angeles, California. These
DILLION 14 properties are within the close vicinity of the project at issue in this petition, which is the

15 Applicant's application for vacation of the public right of way located between 84th Street and

16 Manchester Avenue in the City of Los Angeles, VAC-E1401352 (the "Project"). For example,

17 the property at 8517 S. Vermont Ave. is located less than 150 feet from the Project. Accordingly,

18 Petitioner will be directly affected by the potential environmental impacts of the Project.

19 2. Respondent/defendant City is public entity located in the State of California.

20 The City is required to comply with state, local, and federal law, rules, and regulations, including,

21 without limitation, CEQA.

22 3. Respondent/defendant City Council of the City of Los Angeles ("City Council") is

23 the elected governing body of the City and has final decision-making authority, including the

24 resolution of appeals. Like the City, the City Council is required to comply with local, state, and

25 federal law, including CEQA.

26 4. Petitioner is informed and believes that Applicant is a California nonprofit public

27 benefit corporation that is the applicant for the Project.

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 5. Petitioner is informed and believes that Owner is a real party of interest based on it

2 being the alleged owner on whose behalf Applicant applied for the street vacation at issue.

3 6. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of the

4 respondents/defendants sued herein as DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, and therefore sues them

5 by such fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this petition/complaint to allege their true names

6 and capacities when ascertained.

7 7. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that at all relevant times

8 mentioned herein, Respondents and DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, were the agents, servants,

9 and employees of each other and in doing the things herein alleged, were acting within the course

10 and scope of their authority as such agents, servants, and employees with the permission, consent,

11 and knowledge of each other. The City, City Council, and DOES 1 through 100 shall 1 be

12 collectively referred to as "Respondents" herein.

A d3A3WM3N 13 FACTS AND ALLEGATIONS

DILLION 14 8. CEQA requires that public agencies review potential environmental impacts of a

15 proposal and consider ways to minimize or avoid environmental damage. Under CEQA, a

16 "project" means the "whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct

17 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the

18 environment." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15378, subd. (a).)

19 9. "Approval" of a project under CEQA, means a decision by the public agency

20 "which commits the agency to a definitive course of action in regard a to a project intended to be

21 carried out by any person." (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15352, subd. (a).)

22 10. The Project includes the vacation of approximately 49,500 square feet of streets

23 and/or alleys between 84th Street and Manchester Avenue. The stated purpose of the vacation as

24 set forth in Applicant's application for the street vacation (the "Application") is "to facilitate

25 County of Los Angeles project consisting of up to approx. 418,970 sf of mixed-use affordable

26 housing and community serving commercial retail, a public charter college-preparatory boarding

27 school, a publicly accessible transit plaza, and vehicular parking."

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

- 11. The City form that Applicant was required to utilize for the Application states as

2 follows:

3

4 Area (in sq. fi.) of the proposed vacation area is approx. 49,500 sq. ft. If over 10,000 sq. ft. of buildable area, the vacation is not

5 categorically exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act Guidelines and will require a higher level of environmental review. Contact a vacation staff member to discuss the effect of

6 this on the processing of your application prior to submittal. If the applicant is required to have an environmental determination

7 performed by the Bureau of Engineering Environmental Management Group, the applicant must submit an additional

8 $32,100 fee deposit. This will also increase the processing time by approximately 6 months.

9 12.

10 On February 27, 2020, while the Application was pending, Petitioner submitted a
letter to the City Council and the Public Works and Gang Reduction Committee ("PWGR

11

12 Committee) objecting to the Application on multiple grounds. These grounds included, without

833WM3N 13 limitation, that the City needed to conduct an environmental review of the Project in compliance
DILLION #3 14 with CEQA. A true and correct copy of the February 27, 2020 letter (without exhibits) is attached

15 hereto as Exhibit A to this petition/complaint and is incorporated by reference herein.

13.

16 On August 3, 2020, Petitioner's counsel learned that the PWGR Committee had

17 included an item regarding the Application on the agenda for its upcoming meeting on August 5,
2020, at 9:00 a.m. On August 4, 2020, Petitioner's counsel received an email notification from

18

19 LACityClerk Connect regarding an update to City Council File Number 18-1005-S1, which is the

20 file number for the Application. The update noted that a report from the City's Bureau of

21 Engineering and several otber supporting documents had been uploaded for review by the public
prior to the PWGR Committee meeting scheduled for the next day.

22 14.

23 On August 4, 2020, Petitioner submitted another letter to the City Council and the
PWGR Committee objecting to the Application on multiple grounds. These grounds again

24

25 included, without limitation, that the City was required to conduct an appropriate environmental

26 review of the Project in compliance with CEQA. A true and correct copy of the August 4, 2020
letter (without exhibits) is attached hereto as Exhibit B to this petition/complaint and is

27 incorporated by reference herein. Petitioner also noted in the letter that it was unclear whether the

28 City was treating the Application as a separate project from the County of Los Angeles' (the
4217.101/9004383.1 - 4.

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

"County") Vermont and Manchester Transit Priority Project.' For example, the letter noted that

2 the Bureau of Engineering's report stated that "[t]he transit priority development project and the

3 associated street and alley vacation meet all the requirements of sections 21151.1 subdivisions

4 (a) and (b) and a requirement of subdivision (c) as detailed in the NOE attachments." (Emphasis

5 added.) Petitioner emphasized in its letter that the City could not deem the Project to be exempt

6 under CEQA based on the Vermont and Manchester Transit Priority Project's alleged satisfaction

7 of the conditions required for the statutory exemption.

8 15. On August 5, 2020, the PWGR Committee met to consider the Bureau of

9 Engineering's report and recommendation. Petitioner's counsel appeared telephonically at the

10 meeting and made additional oral objections. However, the City imposed a strict one-minute time

11 limit on the comments. On information and belief, the PWGR Committee adopted a

12 recommendation to the City Council that the Bureau of Engineering's report be adopted, the

• d3A3WM3N 13 Application be approved, and the Project be found to be exempt from CEQA.
DILLION 14 16. On September 3, 2020, Petitioner's counsel received an email notification from

15 LACityClerk Connect regarding another update to City Council File Number 18-1005-S1. The

16 update noted that a report from the PWGR Committee had been uploaded for review. The report

17 was for a September 8, 2020 City Council meeting to consider the Application.

18 17. On September 4, 2020, Petitioner submitted another letter to the City Council via

19 email objecting to the Application on multiple grounds. Again, these grounds included, without

20 limitation, that Project did not comply with CEQA. A true and correct copy of the September 4,

21 2020 letter (without exhibits) is attached hereto as Exhibit C to this petition/complaint and is

22 incorporated by reference herein. Petitioner's counsel also attempted to submit the comment

23 through the City Council's online portal, but the portal was not working at the time, The portal

24 also limited the length of written public comments to 5,000 characters and limited document

25 submissions to a total of five megabytes. In response to their email, Petitioner's counsel received

26 an email from a City employee stating: "The Office of the City Clerk now has a new centralized

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 Public Comment Portal for you to submit your comments on items considered by the Los Angeles

2 City Council to be added as part of the online Council file."

3 18. On September 7, 2020, Petitioner submitted an additional public comment to the

4 City Council via email and through the public portal. A true and correct copy of the September 7,

5 2020 letter (without exhibits) is attached hereto as Exhibit D to this petition/complaint and is

6 incorporated by reference herein.

7 19. On September 8, 2020, the City Council met to consider the Application.

8 Petitioner's counsel appeared telephonically at the meeting and made additional oral objections.

LO However, the City again imposed a strict one-minute time limit on the comments. Petitioner's

10 counsel objected to these limitations on the record as a violation of due process. On information

11 and belief, the City Council adopted the PWGR Committee's recommendation and approved the

12 Application. The official action of the Council for the relevant agenda item states as follows:

# 83A3WM3N 13 Agenda Description: CATEGORICAL EXEMPTION and PUBLIC WORKS AND GANG REDUCTION COMMITTEE NOITTIO 14 REPORT relative to the vacation of Vermont Avenue and 85th
Street Vacation District, California Environmental Quality Act 15 (CEQA) analysis and recommendations as set forth in the Notice of Exemption (VAC-E1401352). 16
Council Action: PUBLIC WORKS AND GANG REDUCTION 17 COMMITTEE REPORT - ADOPTED FORTHWITH

18 20. On September 16, 2020, the City filed a notice of exemption ("NOE") from CEQA

19 for the Project. The NOE identifies the City of Los Angeles as the lead agency for the Project.

20 On information and belief, it also contains the following additional information and descriptions:

21 PROJECT TITLE: Vermont Avenue and 85th Street Vacation

25 and portions of West 85th Street. The site is bound by West 84th Street to the north, West Manchester Avenue to the south, and
South Vermont Avenue to the west. The site is in the South Los 26 Angeles Community Planning area. T.G. 704-A2.

4217.101 / 9004383.1 - 6 -

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

- DESCRIPTION OF NATURE, PURPOSE, AND BEFICIARIES

2 OF PROJECT: The Street Vacation (the Project) is part of a development known as the Vermont and Manchester Transit

3 Priority Joint Development which consists of a mixed-use
development comprised of affordable housing and public-serving

4 retail and community spaces, a career technical education center, a public charter boarding school, and a parking structure. The

5 development also currently includes other community serving uses, such as publicly accessible transit plaza and bus transfer center. The

6 proposed development is designed to revitalize the surrounding neighborhood to bring about positive economic and community

7 development. The street and alley vacations seek to improve mobility and circulation in the development area. See attachment

8 for further details.

9 EXEMPT STATUS: STATUTORY: IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES STRATEGY (PRC Secs.

10 21155 & 21151.1)

11 JUSTIFCATION FOR PROJECT EXEMPTION: The

12 development, including the vacation of street and alley, is exempt pursuant to Public Resources Code sections 21155 and 21155.1. The transit priority development meets all of the requirements of
MBA3WM3N 13 Section 21151.1 subdivisions (a) and (b) and a requirement of subdivision (c) as detailed in the January 2020, Vermont and
DILLION 14 Manchester Transit Priority Project Memorandum on Project Refinements report prepared by Meridian Consultants (including

15 Figures 1-3 & Attachments A-H); this Project is declared to be a sustainable communities project and shall be exempt.

16 21. As discussed in detail below, the Project does not qualify for the statutory

17 exemption under Public Resources Code sections 21155 and 21155.1. a It is a separate project

18 from the County's Vermont and Manchester Transit Priority Project and cannot independently

19 satisfy the criteria for that exemption. Accordingly, under CEQA, the City must conduct an

20 initial study to determine whether it has any potentially significant environmental effects. The

21 City's failure to do so violates CEQA.

22 JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

23 22. Jurisdiction and venue are proper in this Court under Code of Civil Procedure

24 sections 394, 1085, 1094.5, and Public Resources Code section 21168 et seq. Petitioner is the

25 owner of property in the close vicinity of the Project and will be directly affected by the Project's

26 potential environmental impacts.

27 23. Petitioner's counsel submitted written comments at all stages of the public process.

28 Petitioner's counsel also telephonically appeared and submitted oral comments at both the August
4217.101 /9004383.1 - 7-

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 5, 2020 PWGR Committee meeting and September 8, 2020 City Council meeting. Unfortunately,

2 for both meetings, the City limited the length of written public comments to 5,000 characters,

3 document submissions to a total of five megabytes, and oral comments to one minute.

4 Petitioner's counsel objected on the record that such limitations violated Petitioner's due process

5 rights and violated the full public comment and public hearing requirements mandated under the

6 Streets and Highways Code. Still, by virtue of said written and oral comments, which are

7 incorporated by reference herein, Petitioner has exhausted all required administrative remedies.

8 24. Prior to filing this action, Petitioner provided the required notice, a true and correct

9 copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit E.

10 25. As such, Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this action and

11 has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.5.

12 26. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law for the offenses alleged in this petition

* 83A3WM3N 13 and thus petitions this Court for relief as prayed for herein.
DILLION 14 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Peremptory Writ of Mandate/Mandamus--Against Respondents)

16 27. Petitioner incorporates all of the allegations contained within paragraphs 1 through

17 26, inclusive, as if set forth in full herein.

18 28. Petitioner brings this cause of action pursuant to Public Resources Code sections

19 21168 and 21168.5, the California Constitution, the California Streets and Highways Code, and

20 the City's land use regulations and local ordinances.

21 29. The Project is considered a "project" as defined by the California Public Resources

22 Code, as it is an activity that may cause either a direct physical change in the environment or a

23 reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment.

24 30. Respondents' consideration and approval of the Project constitutes "approval of a

25 project" within the meaning of CEQA.

26 31. Approval of the NOE for the Project was discretionary, not ministerial. As such,

27 the City was required to comply with CEQA with respect to the Project.

28 ///•

4217.101 /9004383.1 . 8 -

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

] 32. Respondents approved the NOE without evaluating whether the Project satisfied

2 the requirements for the exemption referenced therein. Instead, in approving the NOE,

3 Respondents relies on the analysis of a completely different project-the County's Vermont and

4 Manchester Transit Priority Project. This violates CEQA in multiple respects. Respondents

5 implicitly admit on the face of the NOE that the Project does not satisfy the numerous stringent

6 requirements for taking advantage of the cited exemption that are set forth in Public Resources

7 Code sections 21155 and 21155.1. The project description does not align with the project that

8 was found to be exempt. The lead agency that purportedly analyzed the Project was not the lead

9 agency for the Project, but was instead the lead agency for the Vermont and Manchester Transit

10 Priority Project. The Bureau of Engineering's report that recommended the approval of the

11 Project includes recommendations from the City's Environmental Management Group that

12 simply do not make sense. Those recommendations include the following language?:

• d3A3WM3N 13 [F]or compliance with public hearing requirements, EMG
DILLION 14 recommends the following language be included in the Council Committee Agenda:
15 California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) analysis and
16 recommendations (1) that project be determined to be statutorily exempt under Public Resources Code Sections 21155 and 21155.1,

17 and (2) that the transit priority development project and the associated street and alley vacation meets alí of the requirements of
18 Section 21151.1 subdivisions (a) and (b) and a requirement of subdivision (c) as set forth in the Notice of Exemption . .
19 33. The City cannot approve an NOE for the County's "Refined" Vermont and

20 Manchester Transit Priority Project' the County's Board of Supervisors would have that

21 responsibility. Instead of going through the process required to approve modifications to the

22 Vermont and Manchester Transit Priority Project, one of which is the inclusion of the street

23 vacation at issue, the City and County appear to have collaborated to circumvent that process by

24 instead having Respondents improperly approve an exemption for the street vacation as a separate

25

27 3 The Vermont and Manchester Transit Priority Project Memorandum on Project Refinements submitted in support of the Project and NOE uses the term "Refined Project" to refer to the County project as refined to include, among other

28 things, the street vacation at issue. (See Attachment to Report dated 07/27/2020 - Notice of Exemption, at p. 6 of the pdf [available at <https://cityclerk.lacity.org/lacityclerkconnect/>under Council File: 18-1005-S1J.)

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 project. In doing so, they likely hoped to avoid the public scrutiny over whether the Vermont and

2 Manchester Transit Priority Project was still on track to satisfy all the requirements of Public

3 Resources Code sections 21155 and 21155.1.

4 34. Here, Respondents were required under CEQA to perform an initial study to

5 determine if the Project would have any potentially significant environmental impacts on the

6 surrounding community. In failing to do so, they have violated CEQA.

7 35. In approving the NOE and failing to conduct the required environmental review

8 for the project, Respondents also violated the City's own regulations requiring CEQA analysis for

9 any vacation of over 10,000 sq. ft. of buildable area. The street vacation at issue here included

10 nearly five times the amount of buildable area, yet Respondents improperly determined it to be

11 exempt from environmental review.

12 36. Petitioner further alleges that the approval of the Project violates the California
83A3WM3N + 13 Streets and Highways Code.

DILLION 14 37. Streets and Highways Code section 8324, subdivision (b) states, in relevant part:

15 "If the legislative body finds, from all the evidence submitted, that the street, highway, or public

16 service easement described in the notice of hearing or petition is unnecessary for present or

17 prospective public use, the legislative body may adopt a resolution vacating the street, highway,

18 Or public service easement."

19 38. Here, the City Council's conclusory determination that the vacation area is not

20 necessary for present or prospective public use 1S not supported by substantial evidence. Among

21 other things, the City did not, for example, evaluate whether the vacated area could be utilized for

22 future public parking or road widening uses. The City also did not consider that it had initially

23 considered implementing its own version of the Vermont and Manchester Transit Priority Project

24 before soliciting the County to undertake the project instead. Should the County's project fail to

25 finally materializea distinct possibility given that construction has not yet even begun nearly

26 three years after County's Board of Supervisors approved the project- then it stands to reason

27 that the vacation area could be required for the previously-considered City project. However,

28 there is no analysis of this possibility in the record.
4217.101 /9004383.1 10 -

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 39. It is a matter of public record that there is significant evidence supporting that City

2 and County may have collaborated in condemning certain other property in the close vicinity of

3 the vacation area for the purpose of the County's Vermont and Manchester Transit Priority

4 Project.4 That history of improper collaboration provides useful context for the lack of

5 meaningful analysis and consideration giving to this Project, both in terms of compliance with

6 CEQA and the requirements of the Streets and Highways Code. Additionally, Petitioner alleges

7 that the general plan functions as a "constitution for all future developments," and land use

8 decisions must be consistent with the general plan and its elements.

9 40. As noted above, the City's extreme limitations on the ability of the public to

10 submit written and oral comments and supporting documents also violated Petitioner's due

11 process rights as well as the public hearing and public comment requirements set forth in the

12 Streets and Highways Code. (See Sts. & Hy. Code, §§ 8320 & 8324.) The limitations also

€ d3A3WM3N 13 violated the City's own regulations and Council Rules. (See City of Los Angeles Bureau of
DILLION 14 Engineering Manual, LAND DEVELOPMENT, at § D 717; Rules of The Los Angeles City

15 Council as Adopted on December 19, 1986 as Amended January 2019 ("Council Rules").) Under

16 the Council Rules, whereas public comment is limited to one minute per agenda item at regular

17 City Council meeting (see Council Rules, § 6), "[p]ublic hearing items scheduled for regular

18 meetings are afforded special notice for a specific Council meeting date and are intended to

19 receive separate public input on a specific matter." (See Council Rules, § 8.) "Interested persons

20 (for example applicants, appellants and property owners) shall be given reasonable opportunity to

21 present oral arguments for or against any proposed action." (Ibid.) Here, the City Council plainly

22 failed to provide the opportunity for public comment required for a full public hearing. Instead,

23 the City treated the proceedings before the PWGR Committee on August 5, 2020, and the

24 proceedings before the City Council on September 8, 2020, as a normal meeting agenda item

25

26 1 "Accepting Sasson Defendants' evidence and reasonable inferences therefrom as true and disregarding the County's conflicting evidence, Sasson Defendants have shown that the City and County collaborated (to some extent) in

27 condemning the Property. Given this collaboration and the County's early involvement in addressing blight on the
Property, the Court concludes that there is a triablo issue of fact as to whether the County engaged in unreasonable
28 precondemnation conduct." (Minute Order of Hon. Daniel S. Murphy, dated Jan. 6, 2020, County of Los Angeles v. 8400 S. Vermont Avenue, L.P. (Super. Ct. Los Angeles County, filed Dec. 8, 2017, No. BC686141).)
4217.101/9004383.1 - 11 -

PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 rather than a full public hearing with a "reasonable opportunity" for impacted property owners

2 such as Petitioner to "present oral arguments . against [the] proposed action."

3 41. In addition to the above, Petitioner also incorporates all of the arguments set forth

4 in its multiple objection letters to the City and the other public comments submitted related to the

5 Project, all of which are incorporated herein by reference. (See, e.g., Exhs. A-D.)

0 42. Petitioner, therefore, requests that this Court issue peremptory writ of

7 mandate/mandamus directing Respondents to vacate and/or set aside the approvals discussed

8 herein, including the approvals of the street vacation application and NOE.

9 43. The public interest will suffer from Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA,

10 the Streets and Highways Code, and City's own rules and regulations. Petitioner, therefore,

11 requests the recovery of its attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

12 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

Re: Objections to BRIDGE Housing's Application for Street Vacation VAC-E1401352, Council File No.: 18-1005-S1; Council File Title: Vermont Avenue / 85th Street / Street Vacation (Accelerated Procedure)

Honorable Mayor Garcetti, Members of the City Council, and Members of the Public
Works and Gang Reduction Committee:
We are writing on behalf of 722-728 S. Broadway, L.P. to object to BRIDGE Housing's application for street vacation on behalf of the County of Los Angeles, VAC- E1401352, Council File No.: 18-1005-S1, Council File Title: Vermont Avenue / 85th
Street / Street Vacation (Accelerated Procedure) (the "Application").
722-728 S. Broadway, L.P. owns the properties located at 8521 South Vermont Avenue (APN 6033-026-013), 8529 South Vermont Avenue (APN 6033-026-014), and 1057-1059 Manchester Avenue (APN 6033-026-022), in the City of Los Angeles, California. One or more of these properties is located directly across the street (Vermont Ave.)-less than 1,000 feet away-from the street and/or alleys of which the applicant seeks a vacation. Thus, 722-728 S. Broadway, L.P. has a direct and
substantial interest in the outcome of the application for street vacation at issue.
Please include this letter and all accompanying exhibits as part of the permanent record related to the Application, including, without limitation, the record regarding any agenda item, decision, or hearing by the City Council or the Public Works and Gang

4217.101 /8585649.1

Las Vegas | Newport Beach | Walnut Creek
newmeyerdillion.com

Los Angeles City Council / Public Works and Gang Reduction Committee February 27, 2020
Page 2

Reduction Committee concerning the Application. This includes, without limitation, any hearing under Streets and Highways Code section 8320 et seq. (See Sts. & Hy. Code, §§ 8322, subd. (a), & 8324, subd. (a).)
Please also consider this letter to be 722-728 S. Broadway, L.P.'s formal request for advance written notice of any future meetings or public hearings concerning the Application.

1. Summary of the Application.

The Application seeks the vacation of approximately 49,500 square feet of streets and/or alleys between 84th Street and Manchester Avenue. (Exh. A [Application], at p. 1.) The stated purpose of the vacation is "to facilitate County of Los Angeles project consisting of up to approx. 418,970 sf of mixed-use affordable housing and community serving commercial retail, a public charter college-preparatory boarding school, a publicly accessible transit plaza, and vehicular parking."1 (Ibid.) It is being
sought in conjunction with a revocable permit (Council File No.: 18-1005).

2. Errors in the Application.

The petitioner/applicant identified in the Application is BRIDGE Housing, which is further identified as a representative of the owner of the properties adjacent to the street and alleys at issue. (Exh. A [Application], at p. 2.) The owner of the properties is identified as the Community Development Commission of the County of Los Angeles. (lbid.) As evidence of its ownership of the properties, the Application purports to attach an "April 2018 Court Order" as Exhibit 2 to the Application. However, the publicly available version of the Application does not include an Exhibit 2. (See https://cityclerk.lacity.org/lacityclerkconnect/index.cfm?fa=ccfi.viewrecord&cfnumber=18 -1005-S1.) Additionally, to the extent the Application meant to refer to the April 23, 2018 "Order Re Motion for Order For Prejudgment Possession Pursuant to C.C.P. 1255.460" that Department 32 of the Los Angeles County Superior Court issued in the matter County of Los Angeles v. 8400 S. Vermont Avenue, L.P., et al., Case No.:
BC686141, then the Application misrepresents the scope and effect of that order. As
the name of the order indicates, it only it conveyed a right of prejudgment possession to the properties to the County, not title. These inaccuracies and omissions render the
Application invalid on its face.

3. No Definite Project.

As part of the City of Los Angeles' ("City") street vacation application process, the Bureau of Engineering ("BOE") must prepare a report regarding the feasibility of the
vacation request. To prepare the report, the BOE must solicit comments from the other
City agencies who might be utilizing or have an interest in the public right-of-way

This is hereinafter referred to as the "County Project."
4217.101 / 8585649.1

Los Angeles City Council / Public Works and Gang Reduction Committee February 27, 2020
Page 3

proposed to be vacated. Here, due to the lack of a definite plan for the County Project for which the street vacation is being requested, BOE and the other potentially impacted City agencies cannot provide full and meaningful comments to the Application.
On information and belief, as of September 2019, the County still did not have final design plans, final construction plans, or final funding approval for the County Project. The County Project is so vague and indefinite that, in response to a request for comments to the Application, a City Senior Transportation Engineer was unable to
meaningfully distinguish the County Project from the project underlying a different street vacation application by a different applicant five years earlier. (See Exh. B [May 22, 2019 Email from E. Guerrero to T. Crocker re: "VAC-E1401352 - DOT Review"].)
In light of the indefinite nature of the County Project for which it is seeking the
street vacation at issue, BOE and the relevant City agencies cannot perform a full and
meaningful review and analysis of the Application as required by law.
4. No or Inadeguate Finding of Consistency with General Plan and
Community Plan.

Streets and Highways Code section 8313 states:
(a) If the proposed vacation of a street, highway, or public service easement is within an area for which a general plan
is adopted by a local agency, the legislative body of the
public entity shall consider the general plan prior to vacating the street, highway, or public service easement.
(b) The procedure prescribed in Section 65402 of the Government Code shall be followed if that section f applies to the proposed vacation. If Section 65402 of the Government
Code does not apply to the proposed vacation, the legislative body may submit the proposed vacation to the local planning commission or planning agency and give the commission or agency an opportunity to report upon the proposed vacation.

(Sts. & Hy. Code, § 8313.)
Government Code section 65402 states, in relevant part:
If a general plan or part thereof has been adopted, no real property shall be acquired by dedication or otherwise for street, square, park or other public purposes, and no real
property shall be disposed of, no street shall be vacated or
abandoned, and no public building or structure shall be

4217.101 / 8585649.1

Los Angeles City Council / Public Works and Gang Reduction Committee February 27, 2020
Page 4

constructed or authorized, if the adopted general plan or part thereof applies thereto, until the location, purpose and extent of such acquisition or disposition, such street vacation or
abandonment, or such public building or structure have been submitted to and reported upon by the planning agency as to conformity with said adopted general plan or part thereof.
The planning agency shall render its report as to conformity
with said adopted general plan or part thereof within forty
(40) days after the matter was submitted to it, or such longer period of time as may be designated by the legislative body.
(Gov. Code, § 65402, subd. (a).)
The street and alleys at issue are located within an area encompassed by City's
General Plan (the "General Plan") and the South Los Angeles Community Plan (the "Community Plan"). Before the Application can be approved, the appropriate City agency must evaluate and submit a report on whether the proposed vacation conforms with the General Plan and Community Plan. That report must contain sufficient findings of fact to support the report's conclusions. Here, either the requisite report has not been issued, or it does not contain adequate findings of fact to support the report's conclusions.

5. No or Inadequate Finding that Rights-of-Way at Issue Are Not Useful as
Nonmotorized Transportation Facility.

Streets and Highways Code section 8314 states:
Section 892 applies to a street, highway, or public service easement vacated pursuant to this part.
(Sts. & Hy. Code, § 8314.)
Streets and Highways Code section 892 states:
(a) Rights-of-way established for other purposes by cities,
counties, or local agencies shall not be abandoned unless
the governing body determines that the rights-of-way or parts thereof are not useful as a nonmotorized transportation facility.

(b) No state highway right-of-way shall be abandoned until the department first consults with the local agencies having jurisdiction over the areas concerned to determine whether the right-of-way or part thereof could be developed as a nonmotorized transportation facility. If an affirmative

4217.101 / 8585649.1

Los Angeles City Council / Public Works and Gang Reduction Commiltee February 27, 2020
Page 5

determination is made, before abandoning the right-of-way, the department shall first make the property available to local agencies for development as nonmotorized transportation
facilities in accordance with Sections 104.15 and 887.6 of
this code and Section 14012 of the Government Code.

(Sts. & Hy. Code, § 892.)

Here, there has been no finding that the rights-of-way at issue are not useful as a
nonmotorized transportation facility. If such a finding has been made, than it is not supported by adequate findings of fact supporting the action. Without such a finding and supporting findings of fact, the City Council may not approve the Application.
6. No or Inadequate Determination that the Vacation Area Is Not Necessary for
Present or Prospective Public Use.

Streets and Highways Code section 8324 states:

(a) At the hearing, the legislative body shall hear the
evidence offered by persons interested.
(b) If the legislative body finds, from all the evidence
submitted, that the street, highway, or public service easement described in the notice of hearing or petition
is unnecessary for present or prospective public use,
the legislative body may adopt a resolution vacating the street, highway, or public service easement. The resolution of vacation may provide that the vacation occurs only after conditions required by the legislative body have been satisfied and may instruct the clerk that the resolution of
vacation not be recorded until the conditions have been
satisfied.

(Sts. & Hy. Code, § 8324, emphasis added.) The above-emphasized language implicitly requires that the City Council determine that the vacation area is unnecessary for present or prospective public use.
Here, the City Council has either failed to make such a finding or failed to support it with adequate findings of fact. For example, there has been no evaluation of whether the vacated area could be utilized for future public parking or road widening uses. Without such a finding and supporting findings of fact, the City Council may not approve the Application.

7. Failure to Comply with CEQA

As noted in the Application, the proposed vacation area is 49,500 square feet,
and any proposed vacation that is over 10,000 square feet of buildable area "is not categorically exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act Guidelines and will require a higher level of environmental review." (See Exh. A [Application], at p. 1.). Here, the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") have not
been satisfied.

The County did not undertake any of the environmental review normally required under CEQA with respect to the County Project. Rather, the County relied solely on a CEQA exemption for sustainable communities projects under Public Resources Code sections 21155 and 21155.1. This Application, however, requires a new approval that would result in the vacation of almost five times the amount of public right-of-way area that is required to trigger "a higher level of environmental review." (See Exh. A [Application], at p. 1.) Under the circumstances, it should not simply be encompassed within the County Project exemption, but should instead be reviewed independently for potentially significant environmental impacts pursuant to CEQA.
Furthermore, even if the County were to assert that the same CEQA exemption applies to the Application, and the City were to accept that such an exemption might potentially apply, the City should not simply accept on faith that the County has satisfied the exemption's requirements. Rather, the County should be required to demonstrate that it is on track to comply with Public Resources Code section 21155.1's various environmental (§ 21155.1, subd. (a)), land use (§ 21155.1, subd. (b)), and project benefits (§ 21155.1, subd. (c)) criteria before it can take further advantage of the
exemption and continue to avoid the requirements of CEQA.

Very truly yours,

Re: Further Objections to Street Vacation Request for Vermont Avenue and 85th Street - VAC-E1401352 (for Item No. 18-1005-S1 on Agenda for August 5, 2020 PWGR Committee Meeting)

Dear Public Works and Gang Reduction Committee:

This office represents 722-728 S. Broadway, L.P., the owner of property ("Owner") within close proximity to the proposed street vacations requested by Bridge Housing, and identified as VAC-E1401352 ("Application").
On behalf of the Owner, we hereby object to the proposed street vacation request (the "Street Vacation Project"). Our office previously submitted written objections on February 27, 2020, copies of which are attached hereto as Exhibits 1 and 2. In addition to the attached letters, we are hereby submitting the entire deposition (including exhibits) of Mr. Edmond Yew, Principal Civil Engineer for the City of Los Angeles, as a link to this e-mail. Mr. Yew has been directly involved in all aspects of the proposed
street vacations as well as prior requests.

We request that the entire deposition, either in print copy or link, be provided to all
members of the Committee and be made part of the permanent record on this agenda
item.

As outlined in the prior letters and the attached deposition, any approval of the Application would be an abuse of discretion and violate the various land use and CEQA
regulations previously identified. In addition, the Owner asserts the following objections.

Further CEQA Objections

It is unclear whether the City is treating the Street Vacation Project as a separate
project from the Vermont and Manchester Transit Priority Project (the "Vermont and

4217.101 / 8881000.1

Manchester Project") for CEQA purposes. It is also unclear whether the City performed any analysis to determine whether the Street Vacation Project was a separate project. The documents submitted to the Public Works and Gang Reduction ("PWGR")
Committee contain contradict each other.

The Bureau of Engineering's report submitted for this PWGR Committee meeting
states:

The transit priority development project and the associated street and alley vacation meet all the requirements of sections 21151.1 subdivisions (a) and (b) and a requirement of subdivision (c) as detailed in the NOE attachments.

(Report from Public Works: Engineering, dated 07/23/2020, at pp. 1-2, emphasis added [available at <https://cityclerk.lacity.org/lacityclerkconnect/> under Council File: 18- 1005-S1].) In addition, the attachment to the report regarding the CEQA notice of exemption states:

Find the vacation, which is a component of the Vermont and Manchester Transit Priority Project previously approved by the County of Los Angeles Board of Supervisors on December 5, 2017, is statutorily exempt from CEQA pursuant to California Public Resources Code Sections
21155 and 21155.1. The transit priority development project and the associated street and alley vacation meets all of the requirements of Section 21151.1 subdivisions (a) and (b) and a requirement of subdivision (c) as detailed in the NOE
attachments. As such, this project is declared to be a sustainable communities project.
(Attachment to Report dated 07/27/2020 - Notice of Exemption ("Attachment re Notice of Exemption"), at p. 2 of the pdf [available at
<https://cityclerk.lacity.org/lacityclerkconnect/> under Council File: 18-1005-S1].) The apparently unfiled notice of exemption1 includes a project title and project description that describe the Street Vacation Project as a separate project. (See Attachment re Notice of Exemption, at p. 1 of the pdf.) However, the analysis included in the Attachment re Notice of Exemption does not appear to analyze the Street Vacation
Project as a separate project. Rather, it analyzes the Vermont and Manchester Project
as subsequently modified through the addition of the Street Vacation Project and labels them together as the "Refined Project". (See Attachment re Notice of Exemption, at pp.

1 Owner requests that the PWGR Committee please address at its August 5, 2020 meeting whether a notice of cxemption has actually been filed for the Street Vacation Project.

4217.101 / 8881000.1

24-25 of the pdf.) This does not make sense, as the lead agencies for the Street Vacation Project and the Vermont and Manchester Project are entirely different. Is the Bureau of Engineeringthe lead agency for the Street Vacation Project-going to be the new lead agency for the Vermont and Manchester Project? These are all questions that the PWGR Committee should address at its meeting before the public.
If, as it appears, the Street Vacation Project is a separate project, then it must independently satisfy all the stringent requirements for the exemption that are set forth in Public Resources Code sections 21155 and 21155.1, or a full CEQA review must be performed for the project. It does not appear that any such analysis has been performed. This violates CEQA.
Note Regarding Public Comment at Subsequent City Council Hearing

Owner's understanding is that it will have an opportunity to provide additional comments
prior to and during a public hearing on the Street Vacation Project before the City
Council that will be taking place at least 30 days after this PWGR Committee meeting. Owner did not receive notice of PWGR meeting at least 14 days prior before the date of the meeting, so the requirement to provide such notice prior to a public hearing with an opportunity for public comment regarding a proposed street vacation has not yet been satisfied. (See Sts. & Hy. Code, § 8323.) Accordingly, the City Council will have to hold
a public hearing that satisfies the notice and opportunity for public comment
requirements under applicable state and local law.

Further CEQA Objections

It is unclear whether the City is treating the Street Vacation Project as a separate project from the Vermont and Manchester Transit Priority Project (the "Vermont and Manchester Project") for CEQA purposes. It is also unclear whether the City performed any analysis to determine whether the Street Vacation Project was a separate project. The documents submitted to the Public Works and Gang Reduction ("PWGR") Committee contradict each other.

Attachment re Notice of Exemption does not appear to analyze the Street Vacation Project as a separate project. Rather, it analyzes the Vermont and Manchester Project as subsequently modified through the addition of the Street Vacation Project and labels them together as the "Refined Project". (See Attachment re Notice of Exemption, at pp. 24-25 of the pdf.) This does not make sense, as the lead agencies for the Street Vacation Project and the Vermont and Manchester Project are entirely different. Is the Bureau of Engineering-the lead agency for the Street Vacation Project-going to be
the new lead agency for the Vermont and Manchester Project? The PWGR Committee's recommendation to the City Council, which is dated August 7, 2020, but which was not posted on the Council File Management System until the evening of September 3, 2020, does not address any of these questions. The City Council should address them at its meeting before the public.

If, it as it appears, the Street Vacation Project is a separate project, then it must independently satisfy all the stringent requirements for the exemption that are set forth in Public Resources Code sections 21155 and 21155.1, or a full CEQA review must be performed for the project. It does not appear that any such analysis has been performed. This violates CEQA.

Note Regarding Public Comment at City Council Hearing

Owner's understanding is that it will have an opportunity to provide additional comments prior to and during a public hearing on the Application before the City Council. Owner did not receive notice of the August 5, 2020 PWGR Committee meeting at least 14 days prior before the date of the meeting, so the requirement to provide such notice prior to a

To the City Clerk & Ms. Keyonna Kidd:

On behalf of 722-728 S. Broadway, L.P. we request that the City please also include the attached documents and below linked documents as part of the 2 record for Item No. 2 on the agenda for the City Council's September 8, 2020
meeting (Council File No. 18-1005-S1). One of the two attached documents ("2020.09.04 Objections") is just a second copy of the same document we attached to our below email on September 4, but with a reduced file size. The other
attached document and the documents to be downloaded using the below link are new.

We will also attempt to also submit comment with a link to the documents through the City's Public Comment Portal,
but the portal was not working on September 4 when we attempted to do so several times from different computers. Thus, to ensure the documents are included as part of the record, we request that you please process them as well.

Here are two links that can be used to download the additional documents (the documents are the same in both links):

Re: NOTICE OF INTENT TO FILE CEQA PETITION
Vermont Avenue and 85th Street Vacation District W.O. E1401352

Honorable Mayor and Members of the City Council of Los Angeles:
This letter shall serve as notice, under Public Resources Code section 21167.5, that proposed petitioner, 722-728 S. Broadway, L.P. ("Petitioner") intends to file a petition under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") commencing an action in the California Superior Court against respondent, the City of Los Angeles (the "City") and its governing body, the Los Angeles City Council (the "City Council").
The petition will seek to challenge the action taken and described in the notice of exemption ("NOE") filed with the Los Angeles County Clerk on September 16, 2020, Recording Number 2020 140069. The action will seek a writ of mandate/mandamus to vacate and set aside the decision of the City Council to adopt the Public Works and Gang Reduction Committee Report regarding VAC-E1401352 (Council File No. 18-
1005-S1), certify the NOE for project title Vermont Avenue and 85th Street Vacation District W.O. E1401352 (the "Project"), and approve Bridge Housing's associated street vacation application. The action will further seek an order requiring the City to prepare a legally adequate environmental impact report and to otherwise comply with CEQA and all other applicable state, federal, and local laws, regulations, ordinances, and policies in reviewing the Project.
In addition, Petitioner will also seek an order staying the effects of the certification of the NOE and other possible approvals, an order directing the City Council
