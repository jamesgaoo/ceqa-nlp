Factual and Procedural Background 16

A. The Hillside Zone 17

18 13. Paseo de las Tortugas is a street in south Torrance which lies in
19 the Hillside Zone. The Hillside Zone is contained in Torrance Municipal Code
20 Article 41 (Section 91.41 et. seq). The properties on this street are generally
21 level with the street with the northernmost portion of the rear yards situated

22 on a steep downward slope. The homes along Paseo de las Tortugas are single
23 family residences in an R-1 zone.

14. The back yards of the residences along the north-facing hillside on 1

Paseo de las Tortugas are supported by retaining walls, and behind the
3 retaining walls is a steep hillside. The majority of the hillside is currently 2

covered in ice plants and flora. The vegetation secures the soil on the hillside

Code Section 91.41.1 mandates "[n]o permits shall be issued for development in

25 Zone require the Planning Director to set a date for a public hearing with the
26 Planning Commission where "[t]he applicant shall have the burden of proving
27 that all the requirements of this Article have been met."

17. The Minor Hillside Exemption permit process requires the

6 B. "The Hill Is Pretty Damn Fragile"

18. There have been three landslides recorded on the same slope
8 within approximately ½ mile of the Project. The Palos Verdes Fault, a major 7

10 comprised of several segments that together form a complex fault system, is 9 geological fault that

16 Paseo de las Tortugas. The landslide destroyed one home at the bottom of the
17 hill and forced the City to purchase from its owner a second home left teetering

18 at the top. Before the landslide, the home at the top of the hill had a gazebo, a

22 became saturated with water and slid" down the hill. A Daily Breeze article
23 dated December 16, 1987 quoting Mr. Tilden attributed the landslide to
24 subsurface water that accumulated over time. The source of the subsurface
25 water was never determined, but a geology firm hired to evaluate the landslide
26 opined it could have come from rainfall, irrigation (such as lawn watering), or a

7 28 21.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
(CEQA)

1 pilings into the hillside to stabilize it, along with installing a drainage system

2 designed to prevent future landslides from occurring.

3 22. Former-Assistant City Attorney Bill Quayle confirmed the

4 hillside's instability in a Daily Breeze article dated January 9, 1987: "The fact
5 that the hillside slid again [another 4 feet in December 1986] confirms what
our geologist told us . and that is that the hill is pretty damn fragile." The 6

7 article said the slope first collapsed in April 1986 and "[a]nother chunk of
8 hillside dropped 4 feet last month." 4

9 23. The City is well aware of the threat landslides present based on its

10 own local planning documents. In 2004 the City published a document entitled

11 "Local Hazard Mitigation Plan" which is required by the Federal Emergency
12 Management Agency (FEMA) and must be approved by the City Council and

dTI 13 the State of California. Torrance published another "Local Hazard Mitigation
HONHA ONIH 97976 ELUIOJEO Mesa, Costa 3150 Bristol Street, Suite 220 14 Plan" in 2017.

15 24. Both the 2004 and 2017 'Local Hazard Mitigation Plan" identified
16 landslides in South Torrance as a hazard. The 2004 plan says at page 73:
17 "Although landslides are a natural geologic process, the incidence of landslides
18 and their impacts on people can be exacerbated by development. Grading for
19 road construction and development can increase the degree of the slope.
20 Grading and construction can decrease the stability of a hill slope by adding
21 weight to the top of the slope, removing support at the base of the slope, and
22 increasing water content. Other human activities effecting landslides include
23 excavation, drainage and groundwater alterations, and changes in vegetation."

24 25. The 2017 plan similarly cautions that "mitigation" actions for
25 landslides include, "Plant and maintain vegetation along cliffs and slopes to
26 hold soil together and reduce the potential for landslides," and "Continue to

12 C. The Proposed "Infinity" Pool

dTI 97976 EIUIOH! Mesa, Costa OZZ mins aNS LOISIIg OSIE 13 26. Baksh requested a Minor Hillside Exemption permit to construct
HONHA ONIH 14 an "infinity" pool and corresponding deck that would extend from the top of the
15 hillside out over the slope, which stretches from the retaining wall downward
16 approximately 100 feet.
17 27. By design, the water in the proposed "infinity" pool is not entirely
18 contained in the pool; water at the far edge of the pool will spill over into a
19 basin approximately 10-feet below at the bottom of the hillside.
20 28. According to Baksh's plans, the pool would be secured by 30-inch
21 diameter concrete piles connected with 24- to 30-inch deep concrete grade
22 beams. The piles would be sunk into the hillside. A Staff Report prepared for
23 the Planning Commission's August 4, 2021 meeting described the projects'
24 dimensions thusly:
25

26 "The deck measures 52' wide by 24' in depth, and provides a 5' side
27 yard setbacks on both sides and a rear yard setback of 67 feet. Due

12 apparently did not require any.

24 ("PRA") requests. None of the e-mail or handful of text messages Torrance
25 eventually produced contained any discussion of engineering or environmental
26 concerns about the proposed "infinity" pool or the hillside. There was no
27 discussion about the possibility of destabilizing the hillside with the proposed
28 construction. There is no mention or consideration of landslides or the area's

6 hillside was graded when the homes were originally constructed, and the top
of the hillside is largely comprised of "fill." According to the Los Angeles
8 County Public Works Grading Guidelines, "fill" is described as "Deposition of 7

9 earth materials by artificial means." "Fill" is not intended to support a
10 structure. SPC Engineering's study says the slope below the "fill" is "likely

Subject: LETTER OF FINDINGS
SITE REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF GEOTECHNICAL CONDITIONS
Your Client: The Nagy Trust, 5105 Paseo De Las Tortugas, Torrance, CA 90505 Neighboring Property: 5109 Paseo De Las Tortugas, Torrance, CA 90505

Dear Mr. Bobko:

In accordance with your request, SPC Engineering has performed a site visit at 5105 Paseo De Las
Tortugas on October 6, 2021, and reviewed available documents related to the stability of the rear
descending slope with respect to the proposed pool construction at 5109 Paseo De Las Tortugas,
which is the neighboring property to the left (Photo 1). During our site visit, we performed a visual
inspection of the property, photo-documented existing conditions, and inspected other nearby areas
related to this matter.

The subject site is located southeast of Pacific Coast Highway and Palos Verdes Boulevard in
Torrance, as shown on the attached Vicinity Map, Plate 1.

Document Review

Our document research and review included reviewing in-house files (geologic maps, historical
aerial photos, etc.), researched documents, and documents provided by you (see attached List of
References). As part of our document research, public records requests were submitted to the City
of Torrance; however, most of the files had not yet been provided at the time of this report. A
summary of the most pertinent available documents is provided below:

Geologic Conditions
There is an approximately 100-foot-high descending slope at the rear of the site. The rear slope
appears to be comprised of fill at the top (roughly 2:1 h:v inclination), with a natural slope

685 N. Shepard Street - Anaheim California 92806 (714) 630-0321 Fax (714) 630-0326

SPC 9141-01 Page:

below likely comprised of older dune deposits, sandy marine sediment, and laminated siltstone
bedrock. The underlying geologic formations in the area have been mapped to comprise an
out-of-slope geologic structure that is prone to landsliding (Dibblee, 1999).

There are three other mapped slope failures on the same subject slope located at distances of
0.22 miles, 0.35 miles, and 0.53 miles from the subject site, as shown on the attached Landslide
Inventory Map, Plate 2. The landslide located 0.22 miles from the subject site occurred in
1986, and reportedly was triggered by subsurface water (LA Times, 1987). Additionally, the
Palos Verdes Fault is mapped to cross the slope at the site, making susceptibility to seismic
loading a concern.

The State of California has mapped areas susceptible to earthquake-induced landsliding, and
the rear slope is mapped within the earthquake-induced landsliding zone, as shown on the
attached Earthquake-Induced Landslide Zones, Plate 3.

Swimming Pool Drawings - 5109 Paseo De Las Tortugas
Design drawings for the proposed swimming pool were reviewed for the 5109 address (MAD
Design, 2020). The swimming pool structure is planned to extend over the top of the rear
slope, and be supported on 30-inch diameter concrete piles (cast-in-drilled hole)that are to be
connected with 24 to 30-inch-deep concrete grade beams. No geotechnical design, report, or
investigation was referenced in the plans.

For the "Pile Schedule" on Sheet S2, it is not clear whether "Depth (Bedrock)" refers to "depth
to bedrock" or "embedment depth into bedrock." This is an important distinction for
construction quality assurance. Additionally, the possibility of weathered bedrock or weak
planes within the bedrock is not considered in the plan set. The term "competent bedrock"
would be appropriate rather than "bedrock." It is unknown at this time whether the proposed
construction meets the geotechnical requirements, such as slope stability, fill density and
susceptibility to settlement, proper embedment of foundations into competent bedrock, soil
strength parameters, horizontal setback distance, slope creep loads, lateral earth pressures, and
others.

Observations

A site visit was performed on October 6, 2021, and a summary of our findings is as follows:

5105/5109 Paseo De Las Tortugas

The rear, top-of-slope wall has rotated downslope, and has separated from the right
property line wall by up to 3 1/4 inches (Photos 2, 3).
The left property line wall has experienced separation and cracking up to 18 feet from the
rear top-of-slope wall (Photos 4 through 6).
On the slope, the near surface soil appeared to be sandy and prone to erosion (Photos 7, 8).

Landslide Repair Between Via Corona & Vista Largo

In 1986, a landslide destroyed two residences on the same slope, located 0.22 miles to the
east of the subject properties (Photos 9, 10). The landslide repair is visible from the streets
above and below.

Conclusions

Based on site observations, review of available information, engineering evaluation and analysis,
and professional experience and judgment, we conclude that the proposed swimming pool
construction at 5109 Paseo De Las Tortugas should be rationally designed based on a geotechnical
investigation and design parameters. A geotechnical investigation is warranted, considering the
geologic history of the site with significant slope stability problems, as well as to identify the
geotechnical parameters for design. More specifically:

There are three landslides that have been recorded on the same slope within about 1/2-mile
of the site (including one that destroyed two residences in 1986, triggered by subsurface
water), indicating geologic vulnerability and propensity to slope failures. Additionally, the
slope is located within a state-mapped zone of areas susceptible to earthquake-induced
landsliding.

The proposed swimming pool structure is planned to be supported on deep foundations
embedded into bedrock; however, based on the design drawings, there are no indications

Civil • Geotechnical • Environmental SPC ENGINEERING Z

SPC 9141-01 Page 4
October 20, 2021

that the foundations were rationally designed. Deep foundations in this application should
be designed to consider lateral loading (slope creep, lateral earth pressures), downdrag
loading from fill settlement, depth to bedrock, and design parameters for the bedrock.
None of these items appear to have been addressed as part of the foundation design.
Furthermore, a subsurface investigation is critical in order to identify any weak layers or
clay seams that could be a slip surface within the formation, resulting in landsliding. Any
foundation embedment into competent bedrock should be below any potential slip surface.
During our site visit, we observed signs of slope creep at the top of the slope. If the
proposed swimming pool foundations are not designed properly and are not sufficiently
embedded into competent bedrock, the swimming pool structure will be susceptible to
downslope movement. Upon downslope movement, the pool plumbing would be prone to
failure, endangering the stability of the rear slope. This is particularly important for a leak
at the rear of the backyard, which could go unnoticed. Additionally, if the pool is subjected
to downslope movement and rotation, the hardscape may be altered to not flow as designed
to the drainage system (catch basin), and result in water draining onto the slope.

A potential slope failure would likely extend beyond the limits of the pool, and into the
adjacent properties, and the possibility that the residential structures may be affected should
be seriously considered. A proper subsurface geotechnical investigation and design is
warranted to reduce risk to the subject and surrounding properties.
