9 Jurisdiction for the' supplemental state claims is based on 28 U.S.C. § 1367(a).

10 2. Venue is proper in the Southern Division of the Central District in that

11 the events and conduct complained of herein all occurred in Orange County.

12 PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

13 3. Mary's Kitchen has been the only service provider in the City of Orange
14

15 ("Orange") for unhoused adults without children for over three decades. The day

16 shelter operates in furtherance of its religious beliefs to serve those in need of

17 sustenance and a place of respite. Repeatedly, the City identified Mary's Kitchen as

18 a resource to meet the state statutory Housing Element required for approval of the

19 City's General Plan for development. Not only has the City put forward Mary's

20 Kitchen's services to satisfy state law mandates, it also identified the day shelter as

21 available services to the United States Department of Housing and Urban

22 Development (HUD), where both the City of Orange and County of Orange held

23 Mary's Kitchen out as a model service provider with no cost to the government.

24 4. At its day shelter, Mary's Kitchen provides wrap-around services to

25 approximately 330 individuals, the majority of whom have one or more disabilities,

26 Since people fall in and out of homelessness, the annual number is significantly

27 higher. Wrap-around services provided include nutritious meals; a reliable mail

28 address for work and government benefits; hygiene; bathrooms; charging stations COMPLAINT: CLASS ACTION: FRCP 23(B)(2)42 U.S.C. §1983. - 2

Case 8:21-cv-01483 Document 1 Filed 09/09/21 Page 3 of 42 Page ID #:3

1 for electronic devices; clothes and laundry service; and medical services. Critically!
it is the only place in Orange that provides a safe place to rest each day. For domestio
violence and sexual assault survivors, this is the only place they feel safe in the city.
4 Prayer and bible study, along with community support, assist moving out of
5 homelessness. Because of Mary's Kitchen, women, veterans, and seniors are
6 connected with other providers, find employment, reconnected with family, and
7 some enroll in educational programs to build a better future.
8
5. On June 18, 2021, in the midst of a deadly global pandemic, and with

10 the knowledge that a tsunami of newly homeless persons is expected soon, the City

11 |Manager acted outside his authority to issue a notice demanding the closure of

12 Mary's Kitchen by September 18, 2021. The existing land use agreement allows

13 operations through 2024. Actions by the City to cause immediate closure of Mary's

14 Kitchen violate state and federal law and put lives of its clients in immediate danger

15 as a direct and anticipated result of the City's actions against the shelter.

16 6. In 2018 litigation' the City suspended all criminal enforcement of anti-
17 camping laws and committed to a healthcare first approach to homelessness while
18 building capacity for solutions. Nearly three years later, the City has taken no steps

19 to increase services or outreach to unhoused adults without children. 2 If it is

20 permitted to shut down Mary's Kitchen, the pernicious pattern of individual cities

21 causing unhoused people to move from city to city, making them another city's

"problem," will repeat. There is no other provider serving this community in the
City, SO the migration of unhoused seniors, disabled and economically marginalized
persons experiencing homelessness is inevitable. More importantly, many will
4 likely die if the City's only homeless service provider is closed.
HISTORY OF MARY'S KITCHEN

7. In 1984, 82-year-old Mary McAnena found her religious calling
helping others. In 1986, the City recognized her program then providing service
9 days per week in Heart Park. However, in 1992, the City passed an ordinance
10 banning sharing food with the many individuals who relied upon Mary for their basid

11 needs. In 1993, the City agreed to allow Mary's Kitchen to relocate to a city site af

12 the end of a cul-de-sac in an industrial area next to the police department where thein
13 services would be less visible. In 2000, Ms. McAnena and the City entered into a

14 formal four-year agreement to rent the property at no cost and to pay utility costs.3
15 8. In 2004, just after Gloria Suess stepped in, the City renewed the lease
16 and expanded the site to allow for additional services. At the time, Mary's Kitchen
17 served about 65 people each day. The lease was renewed again in 2010, and again
18 in 2014, each time recognizing the critical services provided at no cost to the City
19 and the growing need for the assistance Mary's Kitchen provides.
20 9. Barely two years ago, in 2019, when the contract was again renewed,
21

22 the City publicly recognized that the site was "well organized and efficiently run"

23 and referenced the volunteers as "very dedicated to the program." The discussion at

26 Just three years later, at the age of 100, Mary received the Albert

27 Schweitzer Award of Excellence. At 100, she was still committed to saving lives in
a County that disregarded the lives of the poor. She created a place free of judgement
28 to serve people no matter their own personal barriers. COMPLAINT: CLASS ACTION: FRCP 23(B)(2)42 U.S.C. §1983. - 4

Case 8:21-cv-01483 Document 1 Filed 09/09/21 Page 5 of 42 Page ID #:5

the City Council noted that, despite an influx in use due to the closure of the Santa
Ana Riverbed encampment, the patrons were "behaved and orderly" and that the
need had increased to about 200 people per day. The City noted Mary's Kitchen,
4 installed a camera system as requested by police and wanted to expand the space
5 used. The City approved renewal of the land use agreement through 2024 and gave
6 the City Manager authority to extend the agreement in 2024.
10. In early 2020, as the pandemic tore through the country and everyone
struggled to adjust, Mary's Kitchen similarly struggled. Initially, it closed, limiting

10 services to food pick-up, use of bathrooms, mail pick-up and emergency needs. With

11 more limited services, and under Covid-19 safety practices, the City was impacted

12 by hundreds of unhoused individuals who no longer had a safe place to wait during

13 the day or the additional live-saving hygiene and water services provided by Mary's

14 Kitchen for more than three decades, without issue. In or around December 2020.

15 Mary's Kitchen reopened and slowly restored services with new Covid restrictions.

16 11. In September 2020, even before operations were fully reopened, the

17 City informed Mary's Kitchen it was concerned about activities outside the gates

18 and wanted the day shelter to hire a private professional security company.4 The City
19 complaints included the police having to advise people not to be around the property:
20 inadequate monitoring by Mary's Kitchen of the area outside the property after the

21 shelter closed each day; congregating and "loitering" of guests of the service

22 provider outside in the evening; and trash found outside the property. sMary's

Kitchen addressed all of these issues and hired a professional security company to a
take over the intake area of the daytime shelter,' at great cost to the Plaintiff. 6

12. Over the years, Mary's Kitchen has requested City support to provide
4 additional services, housing navigation, and more. The shelter also requested
5 authorization to make shelter referrals, required status for many of the County's
6 shelters and local law enforcement. Mary's Kitchen also requested to purchase the
property, or the neighboring property to expand services, all without success.

13. In August 2021, after issuing the termination notice, the City brought

in
10 County services for the first time. That occurred only once in the last month and

11 appeared to be more hype for the media than help for the guests of Mary's Kitchen.?

12 There was no provider present to assess and enroll individuals into Telecare, the

13 County's only Full-Service Partnership provider.8

21 The City staff requested that Micah's Way of Santa Ana attend the fain

22 to allow all guests to sign up for mail at their address instead. Micah's Way was not

23 lavailable. If Orange residents are forced to move to Santa Ana to receive critical
mail including benefits, DMV, and job-related documents, it will impact the entire
24 region's programs shifting people by forcing them from the North SPA and adding

25 to Santa Ana's already high numbers. The City seems to suggest people should go to neighboring cities with outreach services to be entered into the County 26 coordinated entry system as Orange police officers do not provide that service.

8 Today, approximately 330 people rely upon Mary's Kitchen for

9 daytime shelter and services each week. Others rely on Mary's Kitchen for nutritious

10 meals, job training, and emotional or spiritual support. Until just a few weeks ago.

11 the shelters of North Service Planning Area (North SPA") brought people to and

12 from Mary's Kitchen daily to ensure their residents could access the critical services

13 offered by Mary' Kitchen. Following the City's lease termination notice, only The

14 Salvation Army continues to partner with Mary's Kitchen'.

15 STATEMENT OF FACTS

16 16. Housing and homelessness are crises threatening the lives of people
17 daily. In Orange County, more than one person without a fixed address dies every
18 day. During the pandemic, the numbers increased to record rates of death,
19 disproportionately in the City. In months without full-service at Mary's Kitchen,
20 more people died, reaching record rates of six people per month in July and
21

22 September 2020. In months with full-service at the shelter, the rate often drops to
zero to one deaths.

16 Although Mary's Kitchen temporarily limited services in its congregate

17 space in the initial state-mandated "stay-at-home" order, as the death toll for

18 unhoused persons rose, it reopened its doors, following CDC guidelines.

19 18. The brief daily respite provided by Mary's Kitchen allows people to

20 take steps toward a more secure future. For veterans, it means accessing the

21 assistance earned by their service to the nation. For women, it means not living with

22 the constant vulnerability of sexual assault on the streets for a few hours a day. For

23 people with disabilities, it means a place to accommodate their needs without

19. The City exploited Mary's Kitchen for its own benefit as well. Over
4 the years, it promoted Mary's Kitchen as its only program to meet various state and
federal requirements. It did so to both the HUD and the California Department of
Housing and Community Development. It posted about Mary's Kitchen on its

21. Since the closure of the Santa Ana Riverbed, many Orange County

putting people in jail, they have moved to identifying an individual's need and
providing housing and shelter, improving outcomes for many at-risk unhoused
individuals. Many have developed outreach programs following the best practices in

only law enforcement. As it was at the time the OCCW litigation was filed in
2019, naming the City of Orange as a defendant, the City's law enforcement mission
has been to make unhoused person's someone else's problem by pushing people to

writing. Captain Dan Adams distributed instructions to the police telling them that
"they [the homeless] will keep coming back if we aren't consistent.".15
23. In the 2019 Point in Time County the City of Orange had 341 homeless

15 years. Approximately one-third of unsheltered individuals in Orange County report

16 that they cannot afford housing, even though they are employed. At the same time.

not arrested people from sleeping in public, without any shelter alternative to offer.
the Orange Police Department deliberately disrupts the sleep of homeless individuals
and directs them to move along.
4 NORTH SERVICE PLANNING AREA SHELTERS

25. The County is split into three planning areas for homeless services. The
6 City of Orange is in the North Service Planning Area ("SPA"). In addition to
County-provided services, many cities in the SPA provide some services for those
8
they identify as "residents" of their city. As a result, many people with disabilities

10 are barred from accessing local services because their status as chronically homeless

11 does not meet City-imposed "residency" requirements.

12 26. The City of Orange is the location of a county shelter for families with

13 minor children from any city in Orange County. There is no no-barrier or low-barrien

14 shelter for adults without children, senior or people with disabilities waiting for a

15 placement in the City of Orange other than Mary's Kitchen day-shelter.

16 27. There are no "no-barrier" shelters in the County of Orange. The County

17 operates The Bridges at Anaheim, the only County emergency shelter in the North

18 SPA. In addition, there are approximately 200 beds at shelters with residency

19 barriers in Buena Park and Placentia. Although originally expected to serve all cities

20 in the North SPA per the settlement agreement entered in OCCW, the Court

21 subsequently altered the agreement and allowed a residency requirement for the

22 cities where the shelters are located. These shelters require admission by referrals
23 only. No beds in either shelter are reserved for the use of residents of Orange or
24 guests of Mary's Kitchen day-shelter.
25 28. Because Orange does not contract with any approved referral agency,
26 such as City Net, and will not approve Mary's Kitchen to make referrals, only
27 Orange police officers may make shelter referrals to a facility such as Bridges.

Case 8:21-cv-01483 Document 1 Filed 09/09/21 Page 13 of 42 Page ID #:13

Compounding the fact that there are very limited beds available to begin with, this
makes it very difficult for a resident of Orange to get into any shelter.
29. During the pandemic, Bridges and Buena Park converted to "high-
4 barrier" shelters, limiting residents' daytime movement, becoming inaccessible to
5 individuals with trauma or mental health conditions who required the ability to leave
6 during the day to reduce the trauma in the shelter environment. The restrictions alsa
made them untenable for many survivors of domestic violence or sexual assault.
Placentia is the only "low-barrier" shelter, but it prioritizes residents. It is almost
9

10 always full because of a side deal with the City of Stanton, contrary to the settlement

11 agreement in OCCW.

12 THE MANDATORY DUTY TO PROVIDE FOR SENIORS, PEOPLE
WITH DISABLITIES, LOW INCOME AND UNHOUSED INDIVIDUALS
13

14 30. In 1982, California passed the California Housing Accountability Act.

15 California Government Code § 65589.5. Formerly known as the Anti-NIMBY law,

16 the statute bans discrimination against housing for lower-income households. The
17 legislature declared that the provision of housing for all Californians is a "priority of a

18 the highest order." §65580.

19 31. Under this provision, every city and county is required to adopt a

20 General Plan governing land use and development projects in its jurisdiction. The

21 General Plan includes a "Housing Element," one of seven mandatory components to

22 the General Plan that must be addressed and approved by the State of California's
23 Housing and Community Development Department ("HCD"). The Housing
24 Element is prepared every 10 years. Submission to, and approval of, the Housing
25 Element by HCD is a necessary prerequisite for local governments to qualify fon
26 public funding for various development programs.

Case 8:21-cv-01483 Document 1 Filed 09/09/21 Page 14 of 42 Page ID #:14

32. The Orange City Council is the governing entity for the City. It is
responsible for developing and implementing the General Plan, including addressing
3 the need for housing and shelter for low-income and homeless individuals.
4 33. Each local entity must act consistently with its General Plan and
5 housing element. All land use decisions, zoning codes, the General Plan and all
6 other ordinances and policies affecting land use must be consistent with the housing
element. $65580.5, §65860. All local land-use decisions, including site specifiq
8

9 plans, must be consistent with the adopted General Plan. $65454.
34.
10 In 2007, California passed Senate Bill 2 (SB2). SB2 extended the

11 protections of the Housing Accountability Act to emergency shelters and clarified

12 that it also covers transitional and supportive housing. This measure imposed

13 increased requirements on cities and counties for low-income housing, emergency

14 shelters and transitional/supportive housing. Each city and county must evaluate its

15 need for shelters and provide a comparison to available facilities to address the

16 identified need. The need for emergency shelters must be assessed annually and

17 seasonally. §65583(a)(7).

18 35. Each entity must also designate at least one location where a year-round

19 shelter may be operated without further approval by the local government. The

20 designated location or locations for shelter must have sufficient capacity to meet the

21 entity's entire local need for emergency shelter. The designated location may then

22 be used by right, subject only to reasonable zoning restrictions. Mary's Kitchen sits
23 in the City of Orange's designated zone in its Housing Element. Despite repeated
24 requests by Mary's Kitchen, the City has not permitted the day shelter to include
25 overnight services or expand its footprint for daytime services.
26 36.
27 The express legislative intent of SB2 was to expand the Housing

28 Accountability Act to prevent local entities from denying a proposal to create an

Case 8:21-cv-01483 Document 1 Filed 09/09/21 Page 15 of 42 Page ID #:15

eligible facility if it is needed and otherwise consistent with the locality's zoning and
development standards. Recognizing the NIMBYism the statute was enacted to
combat, the Legislature expressly prohibited the ability of local entities to impose
4 hurdles such as "a conditional use permit or any discretionary" approval from the
5 local government. §65583(a)(4)(A).
6 37. The statute enumerates factors that may be imposed on a proposed
facility. These include, but are not limited to, the number of beds or persons served,
off-street parking restrictions, outside lighting, etc. §65583(a)(4)(A)(i)-(viii),

10 However, the local entity has the burden to establish that any restrictions imposed

11 on a proposed facility, as well as any permit processing standards applied, are

12 objective and directly advance the creation of emergency shelters. If the local entity

13 has an existing shelter that satisfies the statute's intent, a conditional use permit or

14 similar prerequisite may be required to open a new shelter in the same community,

15 Otherwise, the unreasonable denial of a permit for a shelter, as here, is a denial

16 prohibited by statute without the required explanation for the City's decision.

17 38. The Housing Accountability Act provides that an entity shall not

18 "disapprove" a proposed emergency shelter unless it makes written findings, based

19 on substantial evidence, that one of five exceptions are met. §65589.5(d). The

20 allowed exceptions are: (I) the jurisdiction has met or exceeded the need for

21 emergency shelter identified in its housing element; (2) the project would adversely

22 impact the public health or safety in a significant, quantifiable, direct and
23 unavoidable way that cannot be mitigated; (3) denial is required to comply with
24 specified state or federal law and there is no way to comply without rendering the
25 shelter project infeasible; (4) the shelter is proposed on land zoned for agriculture or
26 resource preservation; and, (5) the shelter is inconsistent with both the zoning
27 ordinance and general plan land use designation (but this reason is not allowed if the

city failed to identify the mandated "by right" zones, or that its zones have sufficient
capacity to accommodate the need and failed to demonstrate that the zones can
accommodate at least one emergency shelter). §65589.5(d)(1)-(5).
4 39. Local entities may satisfy the mandate of SB2 in several ways.
Jurisdictions that are successfully implementing a supportive housing program
model under the entity's 10-year plan to End Chronic Homelessness are credited for
supportive housing units created under the 10-year plan if the entity can demonstrate

9 that the units are identified in the 10-year plan and are either currently vacant or have

10 all funding needed to construct the units during the planning period.
40.
11 Local entities may also meet the requirements of SB2 by entering into

12 a multi-jurisdiction agreement provided that any emergency shelter will be opened

13 within two years of the start of the planning period. Gov. Code §65583(d)(1).

14 Entities involved in a joint project must adopt an agreement which, among othen

15 conditions, assigns a portion of the new shelter to each jurisdiction. Specifically, the
16 agreement "shall allocate a portion of the new shelter capacity to each jurisdiction

17 as credit toward its emergency shelter need §65583(d)(1)(2). Also, the housing
18 lelement for each participating local government must set out the following: the

19 method for allocating bed capacity for the shelter; how the jurisdiction's emergency

20 shelter need is met by the proposed facility; the amount of the financial contribution

21 each entity will make for the development, operation and ongoing management of
22 the shelter; the amount and source of money to be contributed to the shelter; and,
23 finally, that the aggregate total capacity claimed by each participating entity in its
24 housing element is not greater than the total beds available at the shelter.
25 65583(d)(1)(3)(A)-(C). In other words, if several cities enter in a multi-jurisdiction
26 agreement for a 200-bed shelter, they may not each claim all 200 beds as evidence
27 that they have complied with the mandate to provide shelter resources.

41. Defendant City of Orange completely failed to meets it statutory burden
while denying Mary's Kitchen's requests to expand services and now acting to shut
down even the day shelter. The City has no emergency shelter in its boundaries and
4 no exclusive use of beds for a homeless adult anywhere in the County. Beds that are
5 not for the exclusive use of Orange may not be counted for Gov. Code cOP.
65583(d)(1)(2) and (3)(A)-(C).

42. The shelter resources Defendant lists in its Housing Element are located

9 in other cities or restrict services based on a variety of categories. The State

10 approved 5th Cycle Housing Element lists services that a shelter may provide. The

11 list is nearly identical to what is provided at Mary's and not available at any othen

12 provider within the City. On page H-59 the City specifically lists Mary's as its

13 provider. The day-shelter cannot offer overnight beds since the City does not permit

14 it and, even if there was an overnight shelter, it could not offer the services at Mary's

15 Kitchen as it the City code requires overnight shelters close from 9:00AM to 5:00PM

16 daily. The Housing Element states that "the city shall provide support for nonprofit

17 entities ... to provide a range of services and housing opportunities for homeless

18 persons in Orange."18

19 43. Mary's Kitchen is in an area designated as an appropriate place for

20 shelter and identified as a site a in the General Plan as mandated by Government Code

21 §65583. Mary's Kitchen has offered to purchase this site and surrounding land from

22 the City to increase services and have greater wrap-around capacity. A draft plan
23 was submitted for the City to review the expansion. Again, there is no lawful basis
24 for the City to violate Government Code §65583.

LIABILITY FOR FAILURE TO PROVIDE

2 HOUSING AND SHELTER

3 44. California Government Code § 815.6 provides that: Where a publiq
4 entity is under a mandatory duty imposed by an enactment that is designed to protect
5 against the risk of a particular kind of injury, the public entity is liable for an injury
6 of that kind proximately caused by its failure to discharge the duty unless the public
7 entity establishes that it exercised reasonable diligence to discharge the duty.
45. The requirement to provide for the basic needs of low-income and

10 homeless individuals in the General Plan and to adhere to the government code is an

11 "obligatory duty which a governmental entity is required to perform," not a

12 Ipermissive one. Failure to meet this duty gives rise to liability whether the

13 underlying enactment allows a private right of action or is self-executing. The term

14 "enactment" includes "a constitutional provision, statute, charter provision,

15 ordinance or regulation." Cal. Govt. Code §810.6.

16 46. The City of Orange municipal code, 17.13.040 requires clients
17 traditional overnight shelters vacate the facility each day and limits services to 45

18 days. The average time to access services in the Orange County Coordinated Entry

19 system is significantly more than 45 days. The failure of the City to meet its

20 obligations under the Housing Accountability Act falls particularly hard on disabled

21 individuals. They face the additional burden of being required to travel considerable

22 distances to obtain the most basic of social services because there are no such

23 services in their communities. They must carry all their possessions with them, more
24 often making them a target of local law enforcement as they attempt to navigate the
25 route to obtain services in the few areas of the County that offer it.

47. The claims set forth in this action are brought by Plaintiffs on their own
behalf and on behalf of all of those similarly situated putative class members
pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P 23(b)(2).
4 48. The Class is defined as:
5
a. All persons who are experiencing homelessness in the City of
6
Orange.
b. All disabled persons experiencing homelessness, including those
| diagnosed as having severe and persistent mental illness ("SPMI") and qualified for

10 Full Service Partnership ("FSP") placements, who have not received reasonable

11 accommodations for their disability.

12 49. The members of the class are so numerous that individual joinder of all

13 members is impracticable, if not impossible. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and

14 on that basis allege that members of the primary class will exceed 330 in number.

15 Similarly, based on the information and belief, the members of the sub-class will

16 exceed 110 individuals, or approximately 30 percent of the total number of people
17 experiencing homelessness in the City of Orange and served by Mary's Kitchen.

18 50. There are common questions of law and fact that predominate over any

19 questions affecting only individual class members in this instance.

20 51. Among the common questions of law and fact are the following:

21 52. Whether the Defendant met its statutory duty to provide low-income
22 housing and a continuum of shelter facilities as required by California Government
23 § Code § 65589.5;
24 53. Whether Defendant's failure to provide programs or services to assess
25 the need for and make reasonable accommodations for unhoused people with
26 disabilities violates and continues to violate Plaintiffs' state and federal statutory
27 rights;
28
COMPLAINT: CLASS ACTION: FRCP 23(B)(2)42 U.S.C. $1983. - 19

Case 8:21-cv-01483 Document 1 Filed 09/09/21 Page 20 of 42 Page ID #:20

54. Whether Defendants planned actions will create a danger to the lives of
unhoused people in the City;
55. Whether injunctive relief restraining further unconstitutional and
4 unlawful acts by Defendant should be ordered by the Court and, if so, the nature of
that injunctive relief;
6 56. The Class Representatives will fairly and adequately protect the
interests of the Class. They have retained counsel who are experienced and
competent in class-action and civil rights litigation. The Class Representatives have

10 no interests that are adverse or antagonistic to those of other Class members.
57.
11 A class action is superior to any other method to secure a fair and

12 efficient adjudication of this controversy. As the relief sought for the class is

13 injunctive in nature, the burden and expense make it impractical for class members

14 to seek redress individually for the wrongs done to them. No class damages are

15 sought. Individual litigation by each class member would necessarily burden the
16  judicial system and run the risk of inconsistent judgments.

17 58. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and on that basis allege that the City

18 acted on grounds generally applicable to the class, making injunctive or declaratory

19 relief appropriate for the class as a whole.

compassion. Volunteers are called to provide services and assist guests to overcome

barriers to returning to a stable means of support.
60. Gloria Suess is the CEO of Mary's Kitchen. Now in her 80's, Ms. Suess
4 has led the organization almost every day since the founder, Mary's passing in 2003.
5 She engages with each person she meets and helps them connect with available
6 resources. She observes an estimated 300-400 people in any month of 2021 who rely
upon Mary's Kitchen for life-sustaining services not available elsewhere in the City,
week.
9 Some people visit daily, others only a few days per
61.
10 For many years, Ms. Suess observed actions taken by the cities and

11 county to exclude those experiencing homelessness from their jurisdictions,

12 including removal of benches that the individuals could lawfully sit on, restricting

13 parking hours in the area to deter people living in their vehicles, increasing police

14 and private security presence, and other tactics to pressure people to leave the City

15 and surrounding area. She is acutely familiar with available local social services and

16 knows of no place in and around the City where people with marginalized income.

17 or housing insecurity can obtain the services offered at Mary's Kitchen.

18 62. Based on nearly two decades of experience and countless hours,she is

19 aware that a significant portion of the guests at Mary's Kitchen have a variety of

20 disabilities - physical, cognitive, medical, mental - some compounded by their
21 status as seniors. She has formed the belief that, as the result of the Defendant's

22 policies, practices and customs, and those of the Defendant's agents and employees,
23 the community served by Mary's Kitchen would be left without any daytime shelten
24 in the City or other placement that accommodates their disabilities, meets their basic
25 hygiene needs, and addresses their food insecurities. The community members
26 without a fixed residence would be without adequate food, water, and a whole host
27 of other critical social essentials if they did not have access to Mary's Kitchen.

mail, and connections to medical providers. Beyond that, Mary's Kitchen provides
8

9 him with respite from the unyielding stress of life on the streets. Mr. Hancox has no

10 alternative for the vital, life-sustaining services provided by Mary's Kitchen. Tg

11 date shelters in other cities have been unable to accommodate his mental health

12 needs. No City or County service provider offered him any housing opportunities,

13 The support at Mary's Kitchen allows him to get the medical care he needs.

14 64. He is diagnosed with a major depressive order. When he has stayed in

15 shelters, his condition is severely exacerbated by the environment, causing
16 substantial anxiety and mistrust. Despite multiple requests for long-term housing, he

17 has not been offered any appropriate placements, let alone any opportunities. He is

18 concerned that if he is forced back into a shelter, his disabilities will be increased.

19 65. On many occasions, Orange Police officers have directed Mr. Hancox

20 to leave or avoid public spaces. Sometimes he was waiting to enter in front of Mary's

21 Kitchen. Other times he was woken up while sleeping in a public space and
22 instructed to move along. Yet other times he was simply sitting on a bench in a public
23 space and directed to leave because police felt he was loitering. To avoid harassment
24 for waiting in front of Mary's Kitchen, Mr. Hancox began waiting at a bus stop about
25 two blocks away. The City then removed the bench and shade cover, putting him at
26 greater risk in his ongoing battle with skin cancer.

Instead, she is now a volunteer at Mary's Kitchen. In a safe place that understands
6 her trauma she is able to gain experience and work toward stability.

9 receive her benefits, showers, nutritious meals, and safety from the dangers faced

10 by a single woman without housing. She is certain that she and other unhoused

11 women will be in immediate and life-threatening danger if they lose access to Mary's

12 Kitchen, where they find a safe environment free from sexual harassment.

13 68. Plaintiff HORACIO AGUILAR does not have any hope that he will

14 be given any options other than Mary's Kitchen because he does not qualify for mosi

15 housing programs. Mr. Aguilar is disabled and does not meet the requirements
16 necessary for stable employment. His disability is aggravated by the noise and
17 crowding in congregate shelters.

18 69. He relies on Mary's Kitchen for food, water, showers, respite, and more.

19 He is certain that without Mary's, his primary source of income of recycling would

20 not be enough to even replace the food he gets, let alone all of the other services. Mr.
21 Aguilar has limited mobility and cannot physically travel great distances to get

22 different services or see a doctor. He waits at Mary's Kitchen for assistance when
23 doctors visit and believes his life would be in substantial danger and his health would
24 be far worse if Mary's Kitchen was not available to him.

for complications related to her chronic medical condition. Ms. Acosta relies on
nutritious food support from Mary's Kitchen to meet her basic needs. She visits
Mary's Kitchen daily. The respite Mary's Kitchen provides is critical to her mentall

The City has not offered her any housing solutions or assistance. While she does

9 have the safety of her vehicle overnight, she struggles to find safe places to rest on

10 access to bathrooms, showers, and more. This is especially important given her many

11 medical needs. Without Mary's Kitchen, she believes her life would be in danger.

12 72. Plaintiff TODD CHRISTOPHER is Navy veteran with an honorable

13 discharge. He served for 16 years from 1976 until 1992 and obtained Veterans

14 Affairs Supportive Housing seven years ago. Despite VASH, Mr. Christopher's
15 housing has been unstable. His first placement ended when compensation for a rent

16 increase was denied by the government agency, next due to a conflict with neighbors,

17 and last when he did not have sufficient income to pay his portion of the rent. When

18 he falls back into homelessness, he turns to Mary's Kitchen for critical support. He

19 knows many other veterans who similarly rely on the services.

11 Due to the repercussions and trauma from his time in Vietnam, he

12 cannot stay in a congregate shelter. He does not fit well with other available support

23 unlawful conduct challenged herein and, to the extent that they did not personally
24 participate, authorized, acquiesced, set in motion, or otherwise failed to take
25 necessary steps to prevent the acts that resulted in the unlawful conduct and the harm
26 suffered by Plaintiffs. Each acted in concert with each other. The challenged acts
27 caused the violation of Plaintiffs' rights.

10 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
Right To Due Process of Law; Liberty Interest 42 U.S.C. § 1983
11 Fourteenth Amendment

12

13 79. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate the allegations set forth in the
14 preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth hereat.

15 80. The due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits

16 government officials, and those acting in concert with them as their employees and

17 agents, from depriving persons of their rights without due process of law. It also

18 protects the liberty to loiter for innocent purposes.

19 81. Plaintiffs and people in similar situations in a city with limited services

20 for unhoused adults other than Mary's Kitchen often have nowhere to go. As a result.

21 they are forced to remain in public space. They do this with the innocent purpose of

22 having no alternative, which does not constitute "loitering."

23 82. Defendant lacks an adequate system of care with standards and
24 guidelines for assessing and addressing the needs of homeless individuals in the City
25 of Orange. As a consequence of this omission, Plaintiffs' rights to due process of
26 law were violated in several ways, including denial of access to programs and
27 Iplacements for which they were qualified based on their disabilities and their status
28
COMPLAINT: CLASS ACTION: FRCP 23(B)(2)42 U.S.C. §1983. - 26

Case 8:21-cv-01483 Document 1 Filed 09/09/21 Page 27 of 42 Page ID #:27

as unsheltered persons. The Plaintiff class has a property interest in these
government benefits and programs and were entitled to a fair and equitable process
for providing and denying access to such benefits and programs.
83. In addition, Plaintiffs' right to due process of law was violated by each
of the Defendants through the application of constitutionally vague laws used to
threaten, intimidate, coerce, cite and arrest Plaintiffs for, inter alia, "camping" in
public, loitering, and placing their possessions on public property when they have
8

9 no other place to put it. The City's laws violate the Fourteenth Amendment because

10 they are so vague as to be impossible to comply with. The unlawful orders to the

11 homeless to move along or be subject to arrest for camping or loitering are directed

12 toward intimidating plaintiffs. Similarly, under Orange Municipal Code §12.66.020,

13 using "extra clothing" is a crime if the person using that clothing appears to be living

14 outside without defining the terms. Provisions similar to the Defendant's loitering

15 ordinance have been repeatedly found unconstitutionally vague and overbroad and

16 a violation of the Fourteenth Amendments "liberty" interest.

17 84. The acts and omissions of Orange, as described herein, violate the

18 constitutional rights of Plaintiffs under the Due Process Clause of the United States

19 Constitution. The wrongful conduct complained of herein was the product of a

20 policy and practice of the City, and was not the product of accident or inadvertence.

21 or random. In so doing, Defendants were deliberately indifferent to the rights of
22 Plaintiffs and the class they represent and acted in willful and reckless disregard of
23 the rights of Plaintiffs and the class.
24 85. Plaintiff Mary's Kitchen was denied due process of law repeatedly
25 when the City refused to consider its request for shelter operations in the City in
26 zone approved for such facilities, as well as when the City recently issued a notice
27 of termination without following state-mandated requirements for written

documentation of the specific items required to be address by the state before
shelter permit may be denied or revoked. Plaintiff Mary's Kitchen had no adequate
notice since the City did not file the statutory notice requirements and, thus, no
4 opportunity to a fair hearing before the City unilaterally cancelled the contract for
use of the property as a shelter for decades. On information and belief, Plaintiff
alleges that the reason why Defendant City has taken this adverse action is because
of the services provided by Mary's Kitchen to a class of persons marginalized by
society.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
10

11 Right To Be Free of Unconstitutional Conditions; 42 U.S.C. § 1983

12 86. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate the allegations set forth in the

13 preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth hereat.

14 87. The City has sought to impose unconstitutional conditions on Plaintiffs

15 as a condition to operate. The government may not impose a choice between a

16 government benefit and the exercise of a constitutionally guaranteed right, here the

17 right to associate and the right to be present in a public space when there is no

18 unlawful intent (*loitering). Similarly, the seems to demand that Mary's Kitchen

19 deny services to some people based on disabilities, perceived or actual, that may

20 make them unable to obtain employment or increase their income or make them an

21 inappropriate fit for existing shelter programs. The City has even requested that
22 Mary's Kitchen discriminate in its volunteers by only accepting those with housing
23 or without mental health conditions. If the government could deny a benefit because
24 of constitutionally protected activity or associations, exercise of those freedoms
25 would in effect be penalized and inhibited. The Supreme Court invokes this doctrine
26 for various government actions.

Case 8:21-cv-01483 Document 1 Filed 09/09/21 Page 29 of 42 Page ID #:29

88. The land use agreement between Orange and Mary's Kitchen is a
government benefit that falls under the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions.

89. The City attempts to terminate this agreement because it alleges Mary's
Kitchen staff have failed to stop people from congregating outside its gates, even
when the day-shelter is not open. The first and fourteenth amendments protect the
right to engage in free speech, congregate, and loiter for innocent purposes. The
condition that requires Mary's Kitchen interfere with such conduct to maintain
operations is an unconstitutional condition.
9
90.
10 The City can and should enforce valid criminal law in and around

11 Mary's Kitchen. Staff welcome law enforcement to do just that. However, any acts

12 by the city to terminate the benefits to Mary's Kitchen and its guests because of its

13 alleged failure to implement unconstitutional conditions and laws violates the rights

14 of each Plaintiff.

15 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
State Created Danger 16 Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment (42 U.S.C.§1983)
17
91.
18 Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate the allegations set forth in the

19 preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth hereat.

20 92. The City is aware that Mary's Kitchen is the only provider for adults

21 without minor children in Orange. The City issued a notice of termination
22 demanding the property be vacated by September 18, 2021. The City has not secured

23 an alternative day shelter with the same minimum wrap-around services to begin
24 operations before that date.

25 93. Without access to nutrition, water, restrooms and hygiene, people's
26 lives will be in danger during the ongoing pandemic and heat.

27 94. Without access to mail, people will be unable to received expected
28 items from the DMV, state benefits, employers, and others that are necessary for

their survival. Many individuals receive their benefits including social security or
2 unemployment via mail at Mary's Kitchen and have no alternative.
3 95. Without access to charge phones, and rest during the day, many people
4 would be unable to communicate with their employers, doctors and families.
5 Similarly, those with disabilities will be unable to safely stay out of the public eye.
6 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
Ultra Vires

8 Orange Municipal Code 3.08.095, California Environnemental Quality

9 Act (CEQA)

10 96. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate the allegations set forth in the

11 preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth here.

12 97. The Orange Municipal Code provides an explicit process for making

13 the decision to end a City contract. The termination notice issued to Mary's Kitchen

14 was issued and signed by the City Manager without following the express process
15 set forth in the Municipal Code and without authority as required by the Code. There
16 was no public meeting or action to designate the authority to the City Manager,
17 Orange County municipal code requires that contracts not specifically covered by
18 the Code be approved by the City Council and signed by the Mayor. The only
19 authority vested in the City Manager with respect to the contract with Mary's
20 Kitchen was to renew it in 2024, not terminate it in 2021.
21
98.
22 The City land use decisions must be made in public meeting by the City

23 Counsel. All past land use agreements with Mary's Kitchen were properly signed by

24 the Mayor with vote of the City Council. With no authority to act, no public meeting!

25 and therefore no valid notice, any action the City takes to seize the land would be

26 without any authority.

27 99. The City did not do any environmental review and did not file a notice

28 of exemption. The City did not do an environmental impact report, approve a
COMPLAINT: CLASS ACTION: FRCP 23(B)(2)42 U.S.C. §1983. - 30

Case 8:21-cv-01483 Document 1 Filed 09/09/21 Page 31 of 42 Page ID #:31

negative declaration, or a mitigated negative declaration. Every discretionary action
approved or carried out by the City requires consideration of whether the California
Environmental Quality Act applies. For any CEQA determination made by a non-
elected decision-maker, including that CEQA does not apply to a project, the City is
obligated to provide for an appeal to the City's elected decision-making body.
100. The closure of Mary's Kitchen is both a project and a lease/license a for
the use of land. Either would require evaluation of potential environmental impacts,
Here, the City failed to evaluate the potential environmental impact of displacing

10 hundreds of people, removing necessary bathrooms and showers, and repurposing

11 the property that has served as the City's Day shelter for decades.

12 101. After the notice was issued, the City had a closed session meeting. The

13 agenda did not include any mention of land use or Mary's Kitchen. Any discussion

14 in that meeting or action arising from that meeting were in violation of the Brown

15 Act and are therefore void. Despite failure to obtain authority to issue or act on the

16 notice, the City expressed its intent to move forward with seizure of the land.

17 102. Unless the Defendant is enjoined from continuing its course of conduct

18 for engagement with the Plaintiff class, Plaintiffs will suffer ongoing and irreparable

19 injury to their rights. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief to prevent these injuries.

20 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

21 Violation of First and Fourth Amendment; 42 U.S.C. 1983

22 103. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate the allegations set forth in the
23 preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth hereat.
24 104. When Mary's Kitchen is not open, Plaintiffs are left with nowhere to
25 go. Individuals often wait in public space in the city of Orange, sometimes on the
26 same street as Mary's Kitchen. Here the associate with other people with disabilities

and unhoused persons, make appointments to meet case workers, or wait for shuttles
to and from County services.
105. Prior to the initiation of this action, each of the Defendants repeatedly
and consistently were stopped, detained, interrogated and ordered by law
enforcement to move along from public places where they have a right to be pursuant
to the First and Fourteenth Amendment. The stops and subsequent detentions and
interrogations constitute unlawful seizures as they were done without reasonable
8
suspicion or probable cause to believe that the individual had or was about to commit
9

10 a crime other than a purported violation of a law necessitated by their status as

11 homeless individuals plus the lack of available shelter.

12 106. Plaintiffs, as everyone else, have a First Amendment right to be present

13 in a public space, to "loiter" a in a public space for no reason and to not be excluded

14 from that space by threat, intimidation or coercion because they are homeless. Since

15 the closure of the Riverbed and the Santa Ana Civic Center encampments, and since

16 the expiration of the County's placements of the Plaintiff class in motels,
17 recuperative care, FSP placements, sober living facilities and the closure of the

18 armories, the Plaintiff class is, again, being stopped, detained, interrogated, ordered

19 to move from public places and, in many instances, cited and arrested by Defendants

20 for crimes directly resulting from the fact that they have no place to live other than

21 in public spaces.

22 107. The Orange Police Department has a policy and practice a of threatening
23 individuals who sleep or sit in public places or exhibit other behaviors which Orange
24 considers "loitering". The Orange Police Department also has informed its officers
25 that they should have "zero tolerance" for the homeless.
26 108. These policies and practices produce municipal liability under MonelA
27 v. Dep't of Soc. Svcs., 436 U.S 658 (1978).

Case 8:21-cv-01483 Document 1 Filed 09/09/21 Page 33 of 42 Page ID #:33

109. The citation and threats of citation for "the use of public streets on
public property for living accommodation or habitation purposes" when there is
inadequate shelter available violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the
4 United States Constitution and Article 7, §17 of the California Constitution.
110. There is an actual controversy between Plaintiffs and the Defendants
concerning the threat of citation if Plaintiffs remain and sleep on public property
with their personal possessions when they have no alternative location to be that will
not violate Defendants' laws. Plaintiffs desire a judicial determination of their rights

10 and duties and a declaration as to Defendants' obligations.

11 111. As a direct consequence of Defendants' past and threatened future

12 actions, Plaintiffs have suffered and will continue to suffer a violation of thein

13 constitutional rights. Plaintiffs have suffered damages in the form of pain and

14 suffering as a result of Defendants' policies, practices and customs.

15 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION
VIOLATION OF FAIR HOUSING ACT
16 42 U.S.C. § 3604 and California Gov. Code § 12955 et seq.
17

18 112. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate the allegations set forth in the

19 preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth hereat.

20 113. Under the Fair Housing Act, a dwelling is "any building, structure, on
21 portion thereof which is occupied as, or designed or intended for occupancy as, a
residence by one or more families 29
22 42 U.S.C. § 3602(b). Emergency and bridge

23 shelters, transitional housing, assisted living and recuperative care facilities, soben

24 living facilities, room and board facilities are all subject to the Fair Housing Act

25 ("FHA") whether publicly or privately owned and operated. The Fair Housing Act
26 requires that an entity not discriminate on a number of bases, including disability.

27 114. Defendants are aware that guests of Mary's Kitchen and class

28 representatives are members of protected classes. As such, they have protections COMPLAINT: CLASS ACTION: FRCP 23(B)(2)42 U.S.C. §1983. - 33

Case 8:21-cv-01483 Document 1 Filed 09/09/21 Page 34 of 42 Page ID #:34

under FHA. Government action that would close the doors of Mary's Kitchen would
take away the only no-barrier daytime shelter that people with disabilities rely on.
Without a complete alternative, this discriminatory impact is inevitable.
4 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION
VIOLATION OF THE 14TH AMENDMENT; ART. I, § 13

6 115. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate the allegations set forth in the
proceeding paragraphs as through fully set forth hereat.
116. Defendants' conduct, as described herein, constitutes a denial of equal

10 protection to the Plaintiff class based on their status as homeless individuals coupled

11 with their presence in public spaces and the lack of available appropriate housing

12 options, from shelters to permanent and supportive housing. The equal protection

13 clause prohibits the Defendants from making determinations about access to
14 government programs on the basis of the Plaintiff class's indigent status.

15 117. As individuals with disabilities and as homeless persons, they have

16 been subjected to selective and discriminatory application of the laws and programs,

17 which has had both a discriminatory intent and a discriminatory purpose. As

18 individuals with disabilities and as homeless persons, they have been the subject of

19 selective and discriminatory application of the laws and programs as a result of bias.

20 negative attitudes, animosity and fear directed at the unsheltered community and

21 disabled persons, all done with the intent to harm a politically unpopular group!
22 Plaintiffs and the class that they represent have been intentionally treated differently
23 from others similarly situated and with no rational basis for the difference in
24 treatment as a result of Defendants' willful, malicious and unlawful acts.
25 118. As a direct and proximate consequence of Defendants' actions,
26 Plaintiffs have suffered and continue to suffer a loss of constitutional and statutory
27 rights and pain and suffering. The individual Plaintiffs are entitled to compensatory

EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION
VIOLATION OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT
(42 U.S.C. § 12132; 42 U.S. Code § 12133; 29 U.S.C § 794a)

119. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate the allegations set forth in the
proceeding paragraphs as through fully set forth hereat.
120. The American with Disabilities Act protects individuals with
9 disabilities against governmental action that constitutes intentional discrimination
10 when the government entity knows or should know that its conduct is substantially
11 likely to result in harm to an individual's federally protected right and, nonetheless.
12 continues its unlawful action.
13 121. Plaintiffs in the disabled class are qualified individuals with disabilities
14 within the meaning of the ADA. Despite knowing this, the City has not provided any 15
reasonable accommodation to meet their needs.
16

17 122. In this instance, Defendant City engaged in intentional discrimination

18 against the class based on their disabilities by intentionally and arbitrarily denying

19 them access to benefits and programs to which they were otherwise eligible,

20 Defendant City is targeting those with severe mental health conditions and working

21 to make life in the City untenable without taking any steps to provide for their needs.

22 In at least one case, a person with such a condition was sent to Mary's Kitchen from

23 BeWell, a County provider, as they were unable to provide services beyond a limited
24 program and had no exit plan. Families from the County shelter also have often

25 frequented Mary's Kitchen for services as they can walk there. In other instances.

26 people with disabilities like Plaintiffs Hancox were directed to move along despite

27 their disability related needs.

123. In doing the acts complained of herein, Defendant has acted knowingly
and with deliberate indifference to Plaintiffs' disabilities and the harm substantially
likely to occur to them as the result of Defendant's unlawful policies and practices.
4 Defendant has accomplished these unlawful acts by using federal and state funds in
ways that discriminate against qualified disabled persons.
NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION
Violation of California Civil Code § 52.1

124. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate the allegations set forth in the

10 | proceeding paragraphs as through fully set forth hereat.

11 125. The Defendants' conduct, as described herein, interferes by threats,

12 intimidation, or coercion, or attempts to interfere by threats, intimidation, or

13 coercion, with the exercise and enjoyment of Plaintiffs' rights as secured by the First.

14 Fourth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution

15 laws of the United States, and of the rights secured by the Constitution or laws of

16 the state of California.

17 126. Defendants have engaged in concerted and repeated conduct to cite and

18 arrest Plaintiffs under unconstitutional ordinances, on their face and as applied, and

19 threatened to cite and arrest them repeatedly. Defendants engaged in coercive and
20  intimidating tactics by conducting unwarranted stops and collecting information on

21 Plaintiffs to push them out of Defendants' respective jurisdictions.

22 127. Defendants' actions are the proximate cause of the harm suffered by the
23 individual Plaintiffs, who are entitled to compensation for their pain and suffering.
24 128. Defendants' continued use of threats, intimidation, coercion against
25 Plaintiffs and the class they represent is ongoing and will continue unless and until
26 the Court enjoins this unlawful conduct.

Case 8:21-cv-01483 Document 1 Filed 09/09/21 Page 37 of 42 Page ID #:37

129. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate the allegations set forth in the
proceeding paragraphs as though fully set forth hereat.
130. Civil Code § 815.6 provides for liability against a public entity when;
(1) the entity violates an enactment; (2) the plaintiffs are in the class of persons

6 protected by the enactment; (3) the enactment is intended to protect the type of injury
complained of by the plaintiffs; (4) the violation of the enactment is the proximate

8 cause of the injury; and, (5) the public entity did not exercise reasonable diligence
9  in discharging its duty established by the enactment.
10 131. An enactment includes a federal or state constitutional provision, a
11 statute, charter provision, ordinance or properly adopted regulation.
12 132. The Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution, Article
13 I, § 7 of the California Constitution, California Civil Code § 52.1, and California
14 Government Code § 65583 et seq. are all enactments within the meaning of 15 California Civil Code § 815.6. Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class are in the class of
16

17 persons protected by these enactments.

18 133. The Housing Element drafted by the City and approved by the State

19 points out that groups provide food, shelter, and other services but only details one

20 such group - Mary's Kitchen. It goes on to list the wrap around services permitted

21 at shelter - they are all items provided by Mary' Kitchen. While the day-shelter does

22 not have traditional "beds19» it does provide all the shelter services to those forced

23 to move during the night and rest during the day due to the lack of shelter in the city.

24 The same document as submitted by the City and approved by the State goes on to

detail that "the city shall provide support for nonprofit entities ...to provide a range
of services and housing opportunities for the homeless persons in Orange."
134. Despite the obligation to take all actions in compliance with the
|Housing Element and General Plan, the Defendant's planned actions would
adversely impact the nonprofit and remove the range of services at the day shelter
6 rather than meet the mandate to support and supplement these services.
135. The aforementioned enactments, applied to Plaintiffs separately and
8

9 together, constitute mandatory duties within the meaning of California Civil Code cop.

10 815.6 and were designed to protect against the injuries alleged herein.

11 136. As described hereinabove, Defendants did not exercise reasonable

12 diligence in discharging their duty established by the enactments identified above to

13 refrain from violating the constitutional and statutory rights of Plaintiffs and the

14 Class.

15 137. As a direct and proximate cause of the aforementioned acts of

16 Defendants, Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class suffered injuries in that they were

17 denied access to existing facilities on grounds that were arbitrary, capricious and

18 discriminatory, were unable to obtain appropriate housing or shelter and were

19 threatened, cited and, in some instances arrested, for living in public places when

20 there was no available shelter or housing.

21 138. Plaintiffs and the Plaintiff Class seek injunctive and declaratory relief
22 and damages for the individual Plaintiffs. The damages sought by the individual
23 Plaintiffs are incidental to the injunctive relief sought in this action.
24 ELEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION
25 Violation of California Government Code § 11135 and California

26 Government Code §65008

27 139. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate the allegations set forth in the

Case 8:21-cv-01483 Document 1 Filed 09/09/21 Page 39 of 42 Page ID #:39

140. California Government Code section 11135 provides that:
No person shall, on the basis of race, national origin, ethnic group
identification, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, color, genetic information, or
disability, be unlawfully denied full and equal access to the benefits of, or be
|unlawfully subjected to discrimination under, any program or activity that is
6 conducted, operated, or administered by the state or by any state agency, is funded
directly by the state, or receives any financial assistance from the state.
8 141. The Defendant receives public monies and financial assistance from

10 state agencies and other state funds passed through the County.

11 142. The term "disability" applies to both mental, medical and physical
The 12 disabilities as defined in California Government Code section 12926.

13 Defendant County, directly and through its contractors and agents, has discriminated

14 against Plaintiffs on the basis of their disabilities and has denied them full and equal

15 access to the programs and activities operated by the County for the benefit of

16 unhoused persons.

17 143. Under §65008 any action is void if it denies land use for enumerated

18 reasons including "because the development or shelter is intended for occupancy by

19 persons and families of very low, low, or moderate income." Here, the City's
20 termination notice attempts to deny land use for simply to stop low income

21 individuals with disabilities from occupying the property daily -other allegations are

22 pretextual.
23 144. California Code of Regulations §12060, Practices with

24 Discriminatory Effect, makes unlawful a practice which actually or predictably
25 results in a disparate impact on a group of individuals, or creates, increases.
26 reinforces, or perpetuates segregated housing patterns, based on membership in

borders because they are unable to afford housing, producing a clear and anticipated
