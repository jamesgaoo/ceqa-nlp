23 INTRODUCTION

24 1. This petition challenges the San Francisco Planning Department and the San

25 Francisco Board of Supervisors' decision to allow the development of an eight-story high rise

26 apartment building without conducting the environmental review required under the California
27 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), including identifying and studying the potential harmful
28 effects of this development, preparing an environmental impact report ("EIR"), and evaluating
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
UNDER CEQA

1 potential measures to mitigate those harmful effects. The proposed project would demolish a

2 culturally and historically significant one-story restaurant called the Grubstake, and build in its

3 place an eight-story apartment building on top of newly-designed commercial space where the

4 Grubstake restaurant and other businesses can operate, all within a narrow lot closely abutting a

5 neighboring six-story residential building.' It would drastically reduce or eliminate natural light

6 in neighboring residences, and potentially create dangerous wind conditions on the neighboring

7 rooftop terraces, or at the street level. The City's2 decision fails to comply with CEQA's most

8 fundamental premise: that projects having any reasonable possibility of significant environmental

9 impacts be adequately studied through an EIR process to ensure that any potential environmental

10 harm can be mitigated to the fullest extent possible. By failing to follow CEQA's mandate for an

11 EIR whenever a project may have a significant effect on the environment, the City has allowed

12 the Project to proceed without adequately analyzing the potentially significant environmental

13 impacts that the Project may cause, thereby foregoing potentially significant mitigating measures.

14 2. Moreover, and separate from the City's CEQA violation, the City's administrative

15 process in green-lighting this Project violated its own procedural rules. This procedural violation

16 a is a separate and independent basis for vacating the City's decision and remanding.

17 3. Petitioner seeks a writ vacating the City's approval of the Project, as proposed, and

18 remanding to the City to prepare an EIR in compliance with CEQA.

19 THE PARTIES

20 4. Petitioner Shawn Farrell is an owner and resident of a condominium unit in the

21 Austin building, located at 1545 Pine Street in San Francisco. The Austin building is directly

22 next to the Grubstake Development Project, located at 1525 Pine Street. Petitioner has an interest

23 in preventing the harmful environmental effects that the Proposed Project may cause to himself,

24 other residents of the Austin building, and the surrounding neighborhood. Petitioner also has an

25 interest in preserving the historical and culturally significant nature of the Grubstake restaurant, at

26 1 Petitioner refers to the proposed project as the "Grubstake Development Project," the
27 "Proposed Project,' or simply, the "Project."

28 2 Petitioner refers to the SF Planning Department and the SF Board of Supervisors collectively as "San Francisco" or "the City.'

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

1 which he has been and will a continue to be a patron. Petitioner wrote letters to the City during the

2 Planning Department and Board of Supervisor's approval processes and spoke during public

3 hearings, objecting to the Project's approval.

4 5. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondent San

5 Francisco Planning Department is an administrative agency within the City and County of San

6 Francisco, that among other things, develops city plans, performs environmental and historical

7 preservation analysis, and enforces the Planning Code. The Planning Department is under the

8 direction of a Planning Commission, which is made up of seven commissioners appointed by the

9 Mayor and the President of the Board of Supervisors.

10 6. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondent San

11 Francisco Board of Supervisors is the legislative branch of the City and County of San Francisco.

12 The Board consists of 11 members, representing 11 districts in San Francisco. The Board voted

13 to deny the appeal and approve the Grubstake Development Project without an EIR on

14 October 19, 2021.

15 7. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Real Party in Interest

16 1525 Pine Street Dev, LLC, is a California limited liability company that owns and operates the

17 Grubstake restaurant located at 1525 Pine Street in San Francisco, and is the project sponsor of

18 the Grubstake Development Project.

19 8. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Real Party in Interest

20 Kerman Morris Architects LLP is an architecture firm based in San Francisco that has been hired

21 by 1525 Pine Street Dev, LLC to design the Grubstake Development Project and work with the

22 City through the approval process, and may be considered a project sponsor as well.

23 9. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that at all times material

24 hereto, real 1 parties in interest DOES 1 through 50, inclusive, were and now are either the agents

25 or principals of the other real parties in interest, and of each other, or were and now are either the

26 owners, interest holders, or co-obligees of the other real parties in interest and, in such capacity or

27 capacities, stand to be directly affected by this litigation.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

P JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 10. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil

3 Procedure sections 1085 and/or 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and

4 21168.5.

5 11. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 393

6 and/or 395 because the proposed Project is located at 1525 Pine Street in San Francisco.

7 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS AND BACKGROUND

8 12. The Grubstake Development Project site at 1525 Pine Street is an approximately

9 3,000 square foot narrow lot with frontages on Pine Street and Austin Street. Currently, the only

10 building on the project site is the Grubstake restaurant. The Project would demolish the existing

11 one-story Grubstake restaurant and construct in its place an eight-story, 79-foot-tall building with

12 21 dwelling units and a large commercial space occupying the ground floor, and mezzanine level

13 of the new building, where the project sponsors propose that the Grubstake restaurant can

14 continue to operate. The Project would reclaim and incorporate some of the culturally and

15 historically significant pieces of the old Grubstake building into the Project.

16 13. The building that currently houses the Grubstake is a one-story lunch-wagon-style

17 diner, consisting of two portions: a lunch wagon originally constructed before 1916 with a sheet

18 metal curved roof, and a main wood-frame rectangular portion that was added to the lunch wagon

19 in 1975. The Grubstake restaurant has operated at the site since the 1960s, and in the 1980s and

20 1990s, it became well known and loved as a welcoming establishment to the LGBTQ community

21 at a time when other business were not open to the LGBTQ community. It was frequented by

22 transgender women and artists who performed and participated in drag shows at nearby venues.

23 It is officially considered a "contributor" to the Polk Gulch LGBTQ Historic District.

24 14. The Grubstake was purchased in 2015 by the current owners, who thereafter

25 proposed plans to demolish the building, and develop the property into a high-rise apartment

26 building on top of commercial space. Those plans were first proposed to the City for approval on

27 May 9, 2016. At that time, the Proposed Project was only six stories high, in conformance with

28 San Francisco building height restrictions. Subsequently, the Proposed Project was modified to

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR RIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

-

2 an eight-story building, relying on the California Density Bonus Law codified at California

3 Government Code Sections 65915 - 65918, to seek numerous waivers and concessions, including

a variance in building height.

4 15. The Grubstake Development Project is directly adjacent to a condominium

5

6 building called the Austin, at 1545 Pine Street. The Austin is comprised of two portions: a

7 twelve-story roughly rectangular building, and a six-story portion, which is itself divided into two

8 roughly rectangular portions, with an open corridor between them, or light well, spanning the

9 entire six stories. The two six-story portions directly abut the Grubstake Development Project

10 site. The six-story portions also have open space terraces on their roofs, which residents of the
twelve-story building can access from the seventh floor.

11 16.

12 The Grubstake Development Project's new eight-story building would be built

13 directly abutting the Austin's six-story portions, enclosing the open light well that runs between

them, and overshadowing by two stories the open

14 roof terraces. As proposed, the development

15 would have a significant impact on the availability of natural light to its surroundings, including

16 by significantly reducing the light that reaches the interior and Grubstake-facing (east-facing)

17 portions of the six-story Austin building. It could also create new and potentially dangerous wind

18 tunnel effects on the roof terraces of the six-story Austin building, since those terraces would be
fully enclosed on their two longer sides.

19 17.

20 The Proposed Project also has no onsite parking, thus significantly increasing

21 congestion and affecting traffic patterns for pedestrians and vehicles. Moreover, the Proposed

22 Project's residential units' only access is on Austin alley, a narrow one-way alley that is already
handling more vehicle and foot traffic than may be feasible.

23 18.

24 On January 27, 2021, the SF Planning Department published a preliminary

25 mitigated negative declaration, declaring that the Proposed Project would not have any significant
environmental impacts, and therefore did not require an EIR under CEQA.

26 19.

27 On February 16, 2021, residents of the Austin building filed an appeal of the

28 preliminary mitigated negative declaration, arguing that the Project's potential significant
environmental impacts required preparation of an EIR.

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

P 20. On May 6, 2021, despite several commissioners noting the significant impacts of

2 the Proposed Project on its surroundings, the Planning Commission voted to uphold the

3 preliminary mitigated negative declaration over the appeal's objection, holding that no EIR was

4 required, and adopting the final mitigated negative declaration.

5 21. At the same hearing, on May 6, 2021, the Planning Commission, further noting the

6 potentially significant environmental impacts of the Proposed Project, denied approval of the

7 Project by voting to disapprove issuance of a conditional use authorization. After the

8 Commission denied issuance of a conditional use authorization, the Commission continued the

9 matter.

10 22. On July 22, 2021, the Planning Commission reversed its previous denial, and

11 granted the Project a conditional use authorization, approving the Project.

12 23. On August 20, 2021, residents of the Austin filed an appeal of the final mitigated

13 negative declaration, arguing that the Grubstake Development Project could cause significant

14 environmental impacts, including on natural light, historical and cultural resources (including the

15 demolition of the Grubstake building), transportation, and wind, thus requiring an EIR.

16 24. On September 27, 2021, the Planning Department filed its response to the appeal.

17 25. On October 19, 2021, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors heard the appeal,

18 and voted to deny the appeal and approve the Project.

19 26. On October 22, 2021, the City filed and published its notice of determination,

20 stating that the Grubstake Development Project will not have a significant effect on the

21 environment, and therefore does not require an EIR.

22 COMPLIANCE WITH PREREQUISITES

23 27. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to the filing of this

24 petition, and has fully exhausted his administrative remedies by participating in the City's

25 administrative processes related to the approval of the Proposed Project without an EIR, to the

26 extent that those processes were available, including Petitioner's submittal of two letters to

27 the City, and testimony at City hearings on the Proposed Project on May 6, July 22, and

28 October 19, 2021.

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

P 28. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law unless the Court grants

2 the requested relief. In the absence of the requested relief, the Grubstake Development

3 Project will commence without an EIR in violation of CEQA, and thus without adequate

4 study of the potentially significant environmental impacts and mitigation measures.

5 29. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5, and, prior to

6 filing this lawsuit, has served upon the San Francisco Planning Commission and San Francisco

7 Board of Supervisors a notice of his intent to file this lawsuit. Copies of those notices are

8 attached collectively as Exhibit A.

9 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

10 Violation of CEQA for Failure to Prepare Environmental Impact Report

11 30. Paragraphs through 29 are hereby incorporated as though fully set forth herein.

12 31. CEQA requires a public agency to prepare an environmental impact report before

13 approving a project that may have significant environmental effects. (Pub. Res. Code § 21151.)

14 32. The EIR is "the heart of CEQA," and so fundamental to the CEQA process, that so

15 long as there is evidence to support a fair argument that a project may have a significant adverse

16 impact, an EIR is required. See, e.g., Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University

17 of California, 47 Cal.3d 376, 392 (1988); Georgetown Pres. Soc'y v. Cty. of El Dorado, 30 Cal.

18 App. 5th 358, 375-76 (2018).

19 33. The City was required to prepare an EIR for the Grubstake Development Project

20 because the City was presented with evidence that the Project may have a significant impact on

21 the environment on multiple, independent grounds, including, but not limited to (1) the

22 demonstrated adverse shadow effects impacting the surrounding natural light; (2) the demolition

23 of a culturally and historically significant building, the Grubstake restaurant; (3) the likely impact

24 on traffic, congestion, and pedestrian safety; and (4) the potential impact on wind.

25 34. The City failed to adequately analyze the potential environmental impacts of the

26 Project through the preparation of an EIR, in violation of CEQA.

27

28

7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

P SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 Violation of San Francisco Planning Code § 306.5

3 35. Paragraphs 1 through 34 are hereby incorporated as though fully set forth herein.

4 36. During the May 6, 2021 San Francisco Planning Commission hearing, the

5 Commission voted to disapprove of the application for a conditional use authorization for the

6 Grubstake Development Project.

7 37. Under San Francisco Planning Code section 306.5, "[w]henever any application

8 for. .. [a] conditional use or variance, or any part thereof, has been disapproved by the Planning

9 Commission .. no application proposing .. [a] conditional use or variance, the same or

10 substantially the same as that which was disapproved, shall be resubmitted to or reconsidered by

11 the Planning Commission . . . within a period of one year from the effective date of final action

12 upon the earlier application."

13 38. Because the Planning Commission disapproved of the Grubstake Development

14 Project's application for conditional use authorization on May 6, 2021, the Planning Commission

15 was precluded from reconsidering the conditional use authorization for one year, until May 6,

16 2022.

17 39. The Planning Commission failed to apply the one-year waiting period under

18 Section 306.5, and reconsidered the conditional use authorization for the same Project on July 22,

19 2021. The City thus proceeded in excess of its jurisdiction, has not proceeded in a manner

20 required by law, and/or has abused its discretion, and thus the approval of the Project must be set

21 aside under California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1094.5 and/or 1085.

22 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

23 WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays for relief as follows:

24 40. a For a peremptory writ of mandate, issued under the seal of this Court,

25 commanding respondent, the City, forthwith, to vacate, annul, and set aside its adoption of

26 the final mitigated negative declaration for the Grubstake Development Project.

27 41. For a peremptory writ of mandate, issued under the seal of this Court,

28 commanding respondent, the City, to vacate, annul, and set aside its approval of a conditional

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

- use authorization for the Grubstake Development Project, and to observe the one-year

2 waiting period required under San Francisco Planning Code Section 306.5.

3 42. For a peremptory writ of mandate, issued under the seal of this Court,

4 commanding respondent, the City, to fully comply with CEQA and conduct legally adequate

5 environmental review prior to approving the Grubstake Development Project as it is

6 currently proposed, including preparation of an EIR.

7 43. For a peremptory writ of mandate, issued under the seal of this Court, or a stay

8 and/or temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction and/or permanent injunction

9 restraining, enjoining, and preventing the Respondents and Real Parties in Interest from any

10 construction or other Proposed Project activities until the Project complies with CEQA and

11 administrative law.

12 44. For its costs of suit herein.

13 45. For its attorneys' fees, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

14 46. For such other relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

23 INTRODUCTION

24 1. This petition challenges the San Francisco Planning Department and the San

25 Francisco Board of Supervisors' decision to allow the development of an eight-story high rise

26 apartment building without conducting the environmental review required under the California
27 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), including identifying and studying the potential harmful
28 effects of this development, preparing an environmental impact report ("EIR"), and evaluating
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
UNDER CEQA

1 potential measures to mitigate those harmful effects. The proposed project would demolish a

2 culturally and historically significant one-story restaurant called the Grubstake, and build in its

3 place an eight-story apartment building on top of newly-designed commercial space where the

4 Grubstake restaurant and other businesses can operate, all within a narrow lot closely abutting a

5 neighboring six-story residential building.' It would drastically reduce or eliminate natural light

6 in neighboring residences, and potentially create dangerous wind conditions on the neighboring

7 rooftop terraces, or at the street level. The City's2 decision fails to comply with CEQA's most

8 fundamental premise: that projects having any reasonable possibility of significant environmental

9 impacts be adequately studied through an EIR process to ensure that any potential environmental

10 harm can be mitigated to the fullest extent possible. By failing to follow CEQA's mandate for an

11 EIR whenever a project may have a significant effect on the environment, the City has allowed

12 the Project to proceed without adequately analyzing the potentially significant environmental

13 impacts that the Project may cause, thereby foregoing potentially significant mitigating measures.

14 2. Moreover, and separate from the City's CEQA violation, the City's administrative

15 process in green-lighting this Project violated its own procedural rules. This procedural violation

16 a is a separate and independent basis for vacating the City's decision and remanding.

17 3. Petitioner seeks a writ vacating the City's approval of the Project, as proposed, and

18 remanding to the City to prepare an EIR in compliance with CEQA.

19 THE PARTIES

20 4. Petitioner Shawn Farrell is an owner and resident of a condominium unit in the

21 Austin building, located at 1545 Pine Street in San Francisco. The Austin building is directly

22 next to the Grubstake Development Project, located at 1525 Pine Street. Petitioner has an interest

23 in preventing the harmful environmental effects that the Proposed Project may cause to himself,

24 other residents of the Austin building, and the surrounding neighborhood. Petitioner also has an

25 interest in preserving the historical and culturally significant nature of the Grubstake restaurant, at

26 1 Petitioner refers to the proposed project as the "Grubstake Development Project," the
27 "Proposed Project,' or simply, the "Project."

28 2 Petitioner refers to the SF Planning Department and the SF Board of Supervisors collectively as "San Francisco" or "the City.'

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

1 which he has been and will a continue to be a patron. Petitioner wrote letters to the City during the

2 Planning Department and Board of Supervisor's approval processes and spoke during public

3 hearings, objecting to the Project's approval.

4 5. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondent San

5 Francisco Planning Department is an administrative agency within the City and County of San

6 Francisco, that among other things, develops city plans, performs environmental and historical

7 preservation analysis, and enforces the Planning Code. The Planning Department is under the

8 direction of a Planning Commission, which is made up of seven commissioners appointed by the

9 Mayor and the President of the Board of Supervisors.

10 6. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondent San

11 Francisco Board of Supervisors is the legislative branch of the City and County of San Francisco.

12 The Board consists of 11 members, representing 11 districts in San Francisco. The Board voted

13 to deny the appeal and approve the Grubstake Development Project without an EIR on

14 October 19, 2021.

15 7. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Real Party in Interest

16 1525 Pine Street Dev, LLC, is a California limited liability company that owns and operates the

17 Grubstake restaurant located at 1525 Pine Street in San Francisco, and is the project sponsor of

18 the Grubstake Development Project.

19 8. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Real Party in Interest

20 Kerman Morris Architects LLP is an architecture firm based in San Francisco that has been hired

21 by 1525 Pine Street Dev, LLC to design the Grubstake Development Project and work with the

22 City through the approval process, and may be considered a project sponsor as well.

23 9. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that at all times material

24 hereto, real 1 parties in interest DOES 1 through 50, inclusive, were and now are either the agents

25 or principals of the other real parties in interest, and of each other, or were and now are either the

26 owners, interest holders, or co-obligees of the other real parties in interest and, in such capacity or

27 capacities, stand to be directly affected by this litigation.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

P JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 10. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil

3 Procedure sections 1085 and/or 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and

4 21168.5.

5 11. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 393

6 and/or 395 because the proposed Project is located at 1525 Pine Street in San Francisco.

7 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS AND BACKGROUND

8 12. The Grubstake Development Project site at 1525 Pine Street is an approximately

9 3,000 square foot narrow lot with frontages on Pine Street and Austin Street. Currently, the only

10 building on the project site is the Grubstake restaurant. The Project would demolish the existing

11 one-story Grubstake restaurant and construct in its place an eight-story, 79-foot-tall building with

12 21 dwelling units and a large commercial space occupying the ground floor, and mezzanine level

13 of the new building, where the project sponsors propose that the Grubstake restaurant can

14 continue to operate. The Project would reclaim and incorporate some of the culturally and

15 historically significant pieces of the old Grubstake building into the Project.

16 13. The building that currently houses the Grubstake is a one-story lunch-wagon-style

17 diner, consisting of two portions: a lunch wagon originally constructed before 1916 with a sheet

18 metal curved roof, and a main wood-frame rectangular portion that was added to the lunch wagon

19 in 1975. The Grubstake restaurant has operated at the site since the 1960s, and in the 1980s and

20 1990s, it became well known and loved as a welcoming establishment to the LGBTQ community

21 at a time when other business were not open to the LGBTQ community. It was frequented by

22 transgender women and artists who performed and participated in drag shows at nearby venues.

23 It is officially considered a "contributor" to the Polk Gulch LGBTQ Historic District.

24 14. The Grubstake was purchased in 2015 by the current owners, who thereafter

25 proposed plans to demolish the building, and develop the property into a high-rise apartment

26 building on top of commercial space. Those plans were first proposed to the City for approval on

27 May 9, 2016. At that time, the Proposed Project was only six stories high, in conformance with

28 San Francisco building height restrictions. Subsequently, the Proposed Project was modified to

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR RIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

-

2 an eight-story building, relying on the California Density Bonus Law codified at California

3 Government Code Sections 65915 - 65918, to seek numerous waivers and concessions, including

a variance in building height.

4 15. The Grubstake Development Project is directly adjacent to a condominium

5

6 building called the Austin, at 1545 Pine Street. The Austin is comprised of two portions: a

7 twelve-story roughly rectangular building, and a six-story portion, which is itself divided into two

8 roughly rectangular portions, with an open corridor between them, or light well, spanning the

9 entire six stories. The two six-story portions directly abut the Grubstake Development Project

10 site. The six-story portions also have open space terraces on their roofs, which residents of the
twelve-story building can access from the seventh floor.

11 16.

12 The Grubstake Development Project's new eight-story building would be built

13 directly abutting the Austin's six-story portions, enclosing the open light well that runs between

them, and overshadowing by two stories the open

14 roof terraces. As proposed, the development

15 would have a significant impact on the availability of natural light to its surroundings, including

16 by significantly reducing the light that reaches the interior and Grubstake-facing (east-facing)

17 portions of the six-story Austin building. It could also create new and potentially dangerous wind

18 tunnel effects on the roof terraces of the six-story Austin building, since those terraces would be
fully enclosed on their two longer sides.

19 17.

20 The Proposed Project also has no onsite parking, thus significantly increasing

21 congestion and affecting traffic patterns for pedestrians and vehicles. Moreover, the Proposed

22 Project's residential units' only access is on Austin alley, a narrow one-way alley that is already
handling more vehicle and foot traffic than may be feasible.

23 18.

24 On January 27, 2021, the SF Planning Department published a preliminary

25 mitigated negative declaration, declaring that the Proposed Project would not have any significant
environmental impacts, and therefore did not require an EIR under CEQA.

26 19.

27 On February 16, 2021, residents of the Austin building filed an appeal of the

28 preliminary mitigated negative declaration, arguing that the Project's potential significant
environmental impacts required preparation of an EIR.

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

P 20. On May 6, 2021, despite several commissioners noting the significant impacts of

2 the Proposed Project on its surroundings, the Planning Commission voted to uphold the

3 preliminary mitigated negative declaration over the appeal's objection, holding that no EIR was

4 required, and adopting the final mitigated negative declaration.

5 21. At the same hearing, on May 6, 2021, the Planning Commission, further noting the

6 potentially significant environmental impacts of the Proposed Project, denied approval of the

7 Project by voting to disapprove issuance of a conditional use authorization. After the

8 Commission denied issuance of a conditional use authorization, the Commission continued the

9 matter.

10 22. On July 22, 2021, the Planning Commission reversed its previous denial, and

11 granted the Project a conditional use authorization, approving the Project.

12 23. On August 20, 2021, residents of the Austin filed an appeal of the final mitigated

13 negative declaration, arguing that the Grubstake Development Project could cause significant

14 environmental impacts, including on natural light, historical and cultural resources (including the

15 demolition of the Grubstake building), transportation, and wind, thus requiring an EIR.

16 24. On September 27, 2021, the Planning Department filed its response to the appeal.

17 25. On October 19, 2021, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors heard the appeal,

18 and voted to deny the appeal and approve the Project.

19 26. On October 22, 2021, the City filed and published its notice of determination,

20 stating that the Grubstake Development Project will not have a significant effect on the

21 environment, and therefore does not require an EIR.

22 COMPLIANCE WITH PREREQUISITES

23 27. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to the filing of this

24 petition, and has fully exhausted his administrative remedies by participating in the City's

25 administrative processes related to the approval of the Proposed Project without an EIR, to the

26 extent that those processes were available, including Petitioner's submittal of two letters to

27 the City, and testimony at City hearings on the Proposed Project on May 6, July 22, and

28 October 19, 2021.

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

P 28. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law unless the Court grants

2 the requested relief. In the absence of the requested relief, the Grubstake Development

3 Project will commence without an EIR in violation of CEQA, and thus without adequate

4 study of the potentially significant environmental impacts and mitigation measures.

5 29. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5, and, prior to

6 filing this lawsuit, has served upon the San Francisco Planning Commission and San Francisco

7 Board of Supervisors a notice of his intent to file this lawsuit. Copies of those notices are

8 attached collectively as Exhibit A.

9 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

10 Violation of CEQA for Failure to Prepare Environmental Impact Report

11 30. Paragraphs through 29 are hereby incorporated as though fully set forth herein.

12 31. CEQA requires a public agency to prepare an environmental impact report before

13 approving a project that may have significant environmental effects. (Pub. Res. Code § 21151.)

14 32. The EIR is "the heart of CEQA," and so fundamental to the CEQA process, that so

15 long as there is evidence to support a fair argument that a project may have a significant adverse

16 impact, an EIR is required. See, e.g., Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University

17 of California, 47 Cal.3d 376, 392 (1988); Georgetown Pres. Soc'y v. Cty. of El Dorado, 30 Cal.

18 App. 5th 358, 375-76 (2018).

19 33. The City was required to prepare an EIR for the Grubstake Development Project

20 because the City was presented with evidence that the Project may have a significant impact on

21 the environment on multiple, independent grounds, including, but not limited to (1) the

22 demonstrated adverse shadow effects impacting the surrounding natural light; (2) the demolition

23 of a culturally and historically significant building, the Grubstake restaurant; (3) the likely impact

24 on traffic, congestion, and pedestrian safety; and (4) the potential impact on wind.

25 34. The City failed to adequately analyze the potential environmental impacts of the

26 Project through the preparation of an EIR, in violation of CEQA.

27

28

7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

P SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 Violation of San Francisco Planning Code § 306.5

3 35. Paragraphs 1 through 34 are hereby incorporated as though fully set forth herein.

4 36. During the May 6, 2021 San Francisco Planning Commission hearing, the

5 Commission voted to disapprove of the application for a conditional use authorization for the

6 Grubstake Development Project.

7 37. Under San Francisco Planning Code section 306.5, "[w]henever any application

8 for. .. [a] conditional use or variance, or any part thereof, has been disapproved by the Planning

9 Commission .. no application proposing .. [a] conditional use or variance, the same or

10 substantially the same as that which was disapproved, shall be resubmitted to or reconsidered by

11 the Planning Commission . . . within a period of one year from the effective date of final action

12 upon the earlier application."

13 38. Because the Planning Commission disapproved of the Grubstake Development

14 Project's application for conditional use authorization on May 6, 2021, the Planning Commission

15 was precluded from reconsidering the conditional use authorization for one year, until May 6,

16 2022.

17 39. The Planning Commission failed to apply the one-year waiting period under

18 Section 306.5, and reconsidered the conditional use authorization for the same Project on July 22,

19 2021. The City thus proceeded in excess of its jurisdiction, has not proceeded in a manner

20 required by law, and/or has abused its discretion, and thus the approval of the Project must be set

21 aside under California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1094.5 and/or 1085.

22 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

23 WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays for relief as follows:

24 40. a For a peremptory writ of mandate, issued under the seal of this Court,

25 commanding respondent, the City, forthwith, to vacate, annul, and set aside its adoption of

26 the final mitigated negative declaration for the Grubstake Development Project.

27 41. For a peremptory writ of mandate, issued under the seal of this Court,

28 commanding respondent, the City, to vacate, annul, and set aside its approval of a conditional

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE UNDER CEQA

- use authorization for the Grubstake Development Project, and to observe the one-year

2 waiting period required under San Francisco Planning Code Section 306.5.

3 42. For a peremptory writ of mandate, issued under the seal of this Court,

4 commanding respondent, the City, to fully comply with CEQA and conduct legally adequate

5 environmental review prior to approving the Grubstake Development Project as it is

6 currently proposed, including preparation of an EIR.

7 43. For a peremptory writ of mandate, issued under the seal of this Court, or a stay

8 and/or temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction and/or permanent injunction

9 restraining, enjoining, and preventing the Respondents and Real Parties in Interest from any

10 construction or other Proposed Project activities until the Project complies with CEQA and

11 administrative law.

Re: Notice of Intent to Commence Lawsuit re: 1525 Pine Street Development
Project (the Grubstake)

To Whom it May Concern:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code Section 21167.5, that Petitioner,
Shawn Farrell, intends to file a petition for writ of mandate against Respondents, San Francisco
Board of Supervisors and San Francisco Planning Department, challenging their failure to
comply with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code
Sections 21000, et seq., and other laws, in connection with the 1525 Pine Street development project (the "Project") at the current site of the Grubstake restaurant. The Planning Department approved the Project on May 6 and June 22, 2021, as did the Board of Supervisors on October 19, 2021, without conducting the necessary environmental review as required under CEQA, and
engaged in other administrative errors that warrant issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate to vacate and remand the approval for this project to comply with CEQA and other laws.

Sincerely,

JONES DAY
