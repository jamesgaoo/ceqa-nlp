VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Petitioner, HI POINT NEIGHBORS' ASSOCIATION ("Petitioner"), alleges through this
2 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition"), as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. Petitioner challenges the approval by the City of Los Angeles ("City" or
"Respondent") of the approvals and permits designed to facilitate development project
proposed at 1447 S. Hi Point Street, Los Angeles, CA (together, the "Project"). The approval of
the Project was contrary to state and local laws and was premised on incentives improperly

8 awarded pursuant to an improperly approved set of guidelines.
9 2. Petitioner also brings an as applied challenge to the Transit Oriented
10 Communities Affordable Housing Incentive Program Guidelines (the "TOC Guidelines"). By
11 adopting the TOC Guidelines outside the voter-approved process and the City charter, 8 Channel Law Group, LLP L1706 amS "PATa BI!YSEM E8E8 12 Respondent exceeded the authority granted to it by the voters and its own laws.
13 3. 8 Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the
'SITFI ÁpraAg 14 permits and approvals ("Project Approvals") adopted by the City in order to facilitate the Project.
15 The Project was approved by the City Planning Commission of the City of Los Angeles.
16 Petitioner requests that the Court vacate the Project Approvals because Respondent failed to
17 comply with the provisions set forth under the State Planning and Zoning Law and local laws
18 and therefore failed to proceed in a manner required by law.
19 4. Petitioner seeks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under California Code of Civil
20 Procedure section 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate, rescind and set aside all Project
21 Approvals because Respondent failed to comply with applicable state and local laws.

1 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
Project

11. The Project consists of the demolition of one (1) existing single-family residential
structure, and the construction, use, and maintenance of new (5) five-story, 57-foot-high multi-
family residential building with 20 dwelling units over one (1) level of subterranean parking.

12. Surrounding properties are generally developed with commercial, single-family
residences, and multi-family residential uses. Properties abutting the subject site to the west are

8 zoned [Q]R3-1-0 and improved with three- and four-story apartment buildings. Properties to the
9 east across Hi Point Street are also zoned [Q]R3-1-0 and developed with one- to four-story
10 single-family homes, condominiums, and small lot buildings. Properties to the north are zoned
11 [Q]R3-1-0 and C4-1-0, and include both single-family and multi-family residential structures as 8 Channel Law Group, LLP LIZ06 12 well as a McDonald's Drive-Thru restaurant and a commercial strip mall. Properties to the south
8 aymnS "pAIa anSIM E8E8 13 across Saturn Street are zoned [Q]R3-1-O and R1R3-RG-O, and include a mix of single-family
'SITH Apraag 14 residences and multistory apartment buildings.
15 13. The project site is a single interior lot consisting of approximately 8,839 square
16 feet of lot area. The subject property is rectangular-shaped and has a street frontage of
17 approximately 52 feet along the westerly side of Hi Point Street, with an approximate depth of 18 170 feet. The subject site is located within the Wilshire Community Plan Area and is zoned
19 [Q]R3-1-0 with a corresponding land use designation of Medium Residential. The "Q" Qualified
20 Condition, established pursuant to Ordinance Number 168,193, limits the building height to 35
21 feet, requires articulation at every 30 feet for building facades exceeding 40 feet (minimum depth
22 of façade modulation is five feet), and prohibits balconies above the first floor which have a line
23 of sight to adjacent existing single-family uses. Ordinance 168,193 provides for additional
24 regulations that are applicable to the project as well.
25 14. On December 30, 2021, the Director of Planning adopted a determination of the
26 applicability of the Transit Oriented Communities Affordable Housing Incentive Program (the
27

4 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 "Letter of Determination") and found that the Project qualified for a categorical exemption from
2 CEQA.
15. In the Letter of Determination, Department of City Planning staff approved a

4 building height for the Project of 57 feet, instead of the 35 feet required by the applicable [Q]

5 Condition, as a Tier 3 project under the Transit Oriented Communities ("TOC") Affordable

6 Housing Incentive Program.

16. The Determination Letter for the proposed development, dated December 30,
2020, stated that "the project site is located within a Tier 3 Transit Oriented Communities
Affordable Housing Incentive Area, qualified by its proximity to the intersection of a Major
10| Transit Stop. The project site is located within 750 feet of the intersection of one Rapid Bus
11
R Lines (Metro Rapid Line 780) and one Regular Bus Line (Local Line 7) at the intersection of
MET pUUPYO Group, dTI SjIng "pAIa anusiM E8E8 [TZ06 12 Pico Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue."

S 13 17. In the Letter of Determination, the Director also approved a 25 percent reduction
Beverly Hills, 14 in required open space under the TOC Affordable Housing Incentive Program.

15 18. In January 2021 members of Petitioner, and owners and residents adjacent to the
16 Project, timely appealed the approval and environmental determination to the City Planning
17 Commission as provided for by the Los Angeles Municipal Code. Multiple appeals were filed.
18 Among other things, the appellants argued that the Project did not comply with the TOC
19 Affordable Housing Initiative Program, with the [Q] Conditions under Ordinance No. 168,193,
20 and that Department of City Planning staff erroneously determined that the Project was exempt
21 from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines, Section 15332, Article 19 (Class 32).
22 19. The City Planning Commission held a hearing on the appeal. The City Planning
23 Commission denied the appeal, sustained the determination to approve the Project as a Tier 3
24 TOC Affordable Housing Incentive Area, and reaffirmed that the Project was exempt from
25 CEQA. A written letter of determination was issued on April 13, 2021.
26 20. On or about November 26, 2018, an appeal of the CEQA determination was filed

to the Los Angeles City Council pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21151(c). The City

Shall an ordinance: 1) requiring that certain residential development 5 ballot question for Measure JJJ read:
6

projects provide for affordable housing and comply with prevailing wage, 7

local hiring and other labor standards; 2) requiring the City to assess the 8

impacts of community plan changes on affordable housing and local jobs; 9

3) creating an affordable housing incentive program for developments 10

near major transit stops; and 4) making other changes; be adopted? 11
0s47 22. The Chief Legislative Analyst for the City prepared an impartial analysis of
'dnois LIZ06
8 amns "pAlA ANTYSIEM E8E8 13 Measure JJJ, which explained that Measure JJJ "creates an affordable housing incentive program 12

MET (auueuo 'SITHH ÁpaAg 14 with increased density and reduced parking requirements in areas within a one-half mile radius
15 around a major transit stop."

17 subdivision (b) of Section 21155 of the California Public Resources Code which in turn takes its 23. Measure JJJ's definition of a Major Transit Stop takes its definition from 16

18 definition from Section 21064.3 of the CPRC which states "Major transit stop... means a site
19 containing...the intersection of two or more major bus routes with a frequency of service interval
20 of 15 minutes or less during the morning and afternoon peak commute periods."
Section 6 (Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC) § 12.22(A)(31)(b) provides that 21

within 90 days of enactment, the Director of City Planning "shall prepare TOC Affordable 24.

22

23 Housing Incentive Program Guidelines (the "TOC Guidelines") that provide the eligibility
24 standards, incentives, and other necessary components of this TOC incentive program described
25 herein." Measure JJJ required that the "[t]he TOC Guidelines shall be drafted consistent with the
26 purposes of this Subdivision and [that the TOC Guidelines] shall include [l" standards regarding

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

eligibility and incentives.

25. According to the City of Los Angeles's Technical Clarifications to the Transit
3 Oriented Communities Affordable Housing Incentive Program Guidelines, Notes for Map 1,
page 6, "confirmation of the correct Tier shall take place at the time a TOC application is
accepted by the Department of City Planning. As transit service changes, eligible TOC Incentive
Areas may be modified."

26. As adopted by the City Planning Commission, the TOC Guidelines depart from
the parameters and requirements of Measure JJJ in multiple respects.

27. Measure JJJ provides that the TOC Guidelines may allow different levels of
10 density increases based upon base zone and density, but the TOC Guidelines utilize a system of

11 Tiers based on the distance from a Major Transit Stop. Under the TOC Guidelines, the Tiers R Channel Law Group, LLP LIZ06 12 allow for different levels of density increases, regardless of the base zone or density of a specific
S 3}InS "PAIE AIISIM E8E8 13 piece of property.
'SITTH ALIIASg 14 28. Measure JJJ also provides that TOC Guidelines must contain incentives
15 "consistent with the following" which include a residential density increase, adjustments to
16 minimum square feet per dwelling unit, floor area ratio, or both, as well as parking reductions.
17 The TOC Guidelines included additional incentives for reductions in yards and setbacks, open
18 space, lot width, maximum lot coverage, height, and transitional height requirements. Bach
19 additional incentive alters the otherwise applicable development standards in the municipal code
20 without complying with the procedural requirements for zone changes, height district
21 amendments, or general plan amendments and variances.
22 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
23 (VIOLATION OF LOCAL ZONING: As Applied Challenge to TOC Guidelines)
24 (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1085 and 1094.5)
25 29. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
26 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
27

7 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 30. As applied to the Project, the TOC Guidelines are unlawful because they grant
2 incentives that are contrary to Measure JJJ and the requirements of the Los Angeles Municipal
3 Code.

4 31. Measure JJJ authorizes incentives for density increases and parking, but does not
5 authorize incentives for increased height, reduced open space, or reduced side or front yards.

6 Voters adopted Measure JJJ with the understanding that projects under the TOC Affordable
7 Housing Incentive Program would provide density increases and reduced parking requirements.
8 32. Among other things, the City granted a 25 percent reduction in the required
amount of open space for the project. However, while the TOC Guidelines authorizes the grant
10 of such incentives, they are defective and unlawful as applied to this project because Measure JJJ
11 never authorized open space incentives. Open space is simply not included as an incentive or 8 Channel Law Group, dTI TIZ06 12 concession in Measure JJJ. In any event, as explained below, even if you apply the 25 reduction

S a}ms "PATA aMSIEM €8E8 13 in open space, the Project still does not meet the Q Condition's open space requirements due the
'STTH Ápraaag 14 specific criteria outlined in the Ordinance for "common open space."
15 33. The TOC Guidelines depart from the framework approved by voters and overturn
16 the development standards adopted by the Los Angeles City Council through "tiers." By
17 allowing increasing density with proximity to transit, the TOC Guidelines effectively create new
18 zones, which are not authorized by the general plan or Measure JJJ.
19 34. The TOC Guidelines are so wide reaching for land use in the City of Los Angeles
20 that they effectively constitute an amendment of the general plan, but the TOC Guidelines were
21 not adopted consistent with a general plan amendment, or even by the City Council. By allowing
22 for increased height and other incentives not provided for in Measure JJJ, Respondent has
23 effectively rendered the general plan amendment moot, creating inconsistencies within the
24 general plan in violation of state law. (Gov. Code, sec. 65300.5.)
25 35. In approving this Project, Respondent has violated its own laws by application of
26 the TOC Guidelines.

27

8 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 36. In adopting TOC Guidelines inconsistent with Measure JJJ, the City Planning
2 Department and City Planning Commission abused their discretion and adopted TOC Guidelines
3 in an arbitrary and capricious manner. As applied to this project, the TOC Guidelines are void.
4 For this reason, the general plan, Wilshire Community Plan, and [Q] conditions applicable to the
5 Project are not overridden by the TOC Guidelines.
6 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
7 (VIOLATION OF LOCAL ZONING LAW: Project Inconsistent with TOC Guidelines)
8 (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1085 and 1904.5)
9 37. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
10 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
11 38. The Project is not consistent with the TOC Affordable Housing Incentive R Channel Law Group, LLP IL706 eymng "pAIa anusIM E8E8 12 Program, as adopted, and is not consistent with the applicable zoning, adopted to ensure
S 13 consistency with the General Plan and the Wilshire Community Plan.
'SITH ApAg 14 39. Judicial review in actions brought for violation of CEQA is generally limited to
15 the administrative record. Extra-record evidence may be admissible in cases where the facts are
16 in dispute and the administrative record is not adequate for judicial review without extra-record
17 evidence. Western States Petroleum Ass'n v. Superior Court (1995) 9 Cal.4th 559, 575. If the
18 lead agency provides the opportunity for members of the public to review the CEQA documents
19 prepared for the project, to comment, present evidence, and subject objections, and the agency
20 makes its decision in the record, judicial review should be confined to the record.
21 40. The TOC Guidelines, as adopted, permit eligible projects within Tier 3 to increase
22 floor area ratio ("FAR") by 50%, while permitting eligible projects within Tier 2 to increase
23 FAR by 45%. In order to award a project with Tier 3 status under the TOC Guidelines, the
24 Director of City Planning must find that the project is "within 1,500 feet of a major Transit stop
25 consisting of two rapid bus routes."
26 41. In the Letter of Determination, the Director of City Planning found that "the
27

9 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

project site is located within a Tier 3 Transit Oriented Communities Affordable Housing

2 Incentive Area, qualified by its proximity to the intersection of a Major Transit Stop. The project
3 site is located within 750 feet of the intersection of one Rapid Bus Lines (Metro Rapid Line 780)

4 and one Regular Bus Line (Local Line 7) at the intersection of Pico Boulevard and Fairfax

Avenue."

6 42. The project is neither located within the requisite distance, nor do the cited bus
lines meet the requisite frequency service intervals. By the City's own method of measuring
8 distance, as stated in the TOC Guidelines, this site is not located within 750 feet of the Pico and
Fairfax intersection.

10 43. Furthermore, using the City's own methodology as shown in Appendix A of the

ß 11 TOC Guidelines, at the time the project was accepted for review in December 2020, the Metro JTI 'dnory LLZ06 12 Rapid Line 780 did not offer a frequency of service interval of 15 minutes or less during the
13 S ejing "PALE AIIYSI!M E8€8 morning and afternoon peak commute periods in either direction.
MET [3uueYo Beverly Hills, 14 44. The frequency of service interval for Rapid Line 780 is 21 minutes in the
15 castbound direction and 22 minutes in the westbound direction. Both are greater than 15
16 minutes, the amount required by the definition of a major transit stop.
17 45. In response to the appeals filed, the City claimed in its Appeal Recommendation
18 Report ("Appeal Recommendation Report") that the subject property is located within a Tier 3
19 TOC area not because it was within 750 feet of the intersection of one Rapid Bus Lines and one
20 Regular Bus Line but because it was within 1500 feet of "the intersection of two rapid bus routes
21 (Santa Monica Big Blue Bus Rapid 7 Line, Metro Rapid Line 780, and Metro Rapid Line R7)."
22 However, the Metro Rapid Line R7 does not exist. The City mistook it for the Santa Monica Big
23 Blue Bus Rapid 7 Line which it had already mentioned.
24 46. In addition, the City claimed in its Appeal Recommendation Report that "the
25 definition of a Major Transit Stop was subsequently clarified through City Planning on August
26 19, 2020 to apply only to transit schedules in place as of March 17, 2020." Even under this new
27

10 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 definition, according to the timetable that was in effect on that date, Metro Rapid Line
2 780 still does not offer a frequency of service interval of 15 minutes or less during the morning
3 and afternoon peak commute period.

4 47. Rather than stand by its findings in its original Determination Letter - that the
5 project is within 750 feet of the intersection of one Rapid Bus Line and one Regular Bus Line,
6 the City then claimed the project is qualified by its proximity to a Major Transit Stop involving
7 the intersection of two rapid bus routes within 1500 feet of the site. Given Metro Rapid Line
8 780's failure to meet the requisite headways, this claim is false.
48. The only way a bus line along Fairfax could meet the requisite 15-minute
10 frequency of service interval is if the City aggregated the frequency of service intervals of
11 multiple bus lines along Fairfax Avenue-a fact not mentioned by the City in its Determination R MET [aueYo d'T1'dnoIS I1706 ,34mS "pALA AIuSTM ESE8 12 Letter nor its Appeal Recommendation Report.

8 13 49. At the Los Angeles City Planning Commission Meeting in response to the appeals
'SITHI Ápraag 14 City Planning Staff stated ".in any case, there's Santa Monica Big Blue Bus 7, Big Blue Bus
15 R7 intersecting with Local Line 217 and Metro Line Rapid 780, SO that was the qualification that
16 was determined February 27[, 2020] before COVID and that would still stand today."
17 50. This instance was the first time City Planning Staff explicitly stated that Metro
18 Line 217 and Metro Rapid Line 780 were used to justify Pico Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue's
19 status as a Major Transit Stop. The only other mention of Line 217 in the City's 228-page
20 Appeal Recommendation Report was a handwritten notation.
21 51. The City apparently combined the Metro Rapid Line 780 and the Metro Line 217,
22 neither of which meet the 15-minute frequency of service interval required, into a single bus
23 route with a frequency of service of 15 minutes or less as required by the definition of a Major
24 Transit Stop.
25 52. However, the TOC Guidelines cite "SCAG and OPR Methodology" in
26 determining the number of trips that occur during peak period. In SCAG's own Transit Technical
27

11 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Report for Connect SoCal (2020-2045 Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities
2 Strategy), it states "separate but overlapping bus routes that do not individually meet the 15-
3 minute threshold may not be combined in order to qualify as a [corridor with fixed route bus

4 service with service intervals no longer than 15 minutes during peak commute periods]
5 [emphasis added]." Neither the Metro Rapid Line 780 nor the Metro Line 217 meet the 15-

6 minute threshold on their own and they may not be combined in order to qualify as a major bus
7 route with service intervals no longer than 15 minutes. As such the Pico Boulevard and Fairfax
8| Avenue intersection cannot be considered a Major Transit Stop.
9 53. Even if the Project was located in a Tier 3 incentive area, the project is still not
10 consistent with the TOC requirements. Section V.4 of the TOC Guidelines provide:

22| of "usable open space" be provided for each dwelling unit. Ordinance No. 168,193 lays out clear
23 criteria for what can be considered "usable open space." The project's proposed open space does
24 not meet these criteria. For example, the Q conditions require that private open space have a
25 horizontal dimension of at least 15 feet in width. Yet, a number of the patios and balconies on the
26 first habitable level do not meet the Q Condition's 15-foot in width requirement. Additionally,
