FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE / Contra Costa Superior Court Casc No.: N21-1274

I. INTRODUCTION

1. Contra Costa County ("County") and its Board of Supervisors (collectively,
"Respondents") approved a 125-unit single family housing development (the "Tassajara Parks

5 Project" or "Project") in unincorporated Contra Costa County without a supply of water. Under
applicable law, this is illegal.

6 2.

7 In connection with that approval, Respondents certified an environmental impact

8 report ("EIR") stating that water will be supplied by Petitioner East Bay Municipal Utility

9 District (the "District"), but the District has repeatedly made clear most recently in a June 8,

10 2021 Resolution of its Board (attached as Exhibit A) - that it "does not intend to serve the
Project."

11 3.

BARG COFFIN LEWIS & TRAPF 2 12 The Project is located outside of the District's Ultimate Service Boundary

u 13

Z (*USB"), and Respondents' approval assumes the District will: (a) expand its USB to encompass

14 the Project and (b) provide water to the Project.

cc 4.

15 The District has informed Respondents that it will do neither because, in light of

16 the drought and other pressures on its water supply, the District has determined that (a) its

17 existing sources of water are already (i.e., without the Project) insufficient to reliably serve

18 current and future customers within its USB, and (b) therefore, annexing the Project would
violate the District's Annexation Policies.

19 5.

20 Respondents' approval of the Project violated State Planning and Zoning Law and

21 County General Plan provisions that prohibit approval of projects without adequate water.
6.

22 Respondents' certification of the EIR also violated the California Environmental

23 Quality Act ("CEQA") because (a) the EIR failed to identify a reliable source of water and assess
the impacts of providing it, and (b) Respondents failed to correct and recirculate the EIR once
24 they learned that the water they were relying on (from the District) would not materialize.

25 7.

26 Therefore, the District hereby petitions the Court to set aside Respondents'

27 approval of the Project and certification of the EIR.

28

1 II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 8. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to California Code of Civil

3 Procedure section 1094.5 (alternatively, section 1085), and Public Resources Code sections

4 21168 (alternatively, section 21168.5) and 21168.9. This Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of a

5 mandate directing the County to vacate and set aside approval of the Project and certification of

6 the EIR under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5. The Court has jurisdiction to

7 issue declaratory relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1060 and injunctive relief

8 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 525 et seq.

9. Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of action alleged in this Petition

10 arose in the County of Contra Costa. Venue is also proper in this Court because the Project is

11 located in the County of Contra Costa.

A III. PARTIES

w 13 10. Petitioner EAST BAY MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT (the "District") is a
ATTORN 14 public utility formed in 1923 by California's Municipal Utility District Act. (Pub. Utility Code
15 section 11501 et seq.) The District provides drinking water to approximately 1.4 million
16 customers in Alameda and Contra Costa counties. The District's water supply primarily comes
17 from capturing snowmelt from the Mokelumne River watershed and storing it at Pardee it
18 Reservoir, 90 miles east of the Bay Area.

19 11. In addition, local runoff is stored in several East Bay reservoirs for treatment and
20 delivery to customers and to assure emergency supplies are available locally. In dry years,
21 enough water can be lost through evaporation to completely offset any water gained from local
22 runoff.

23 12. With regards to the Project, the District is a responsible agency under Public
24 Resources Code section 21080.1.

25 13. The District and its customers would be directly, adversely and irreparably
26 affected by the Project and its components, as described herein, until and unless this Court
27 provides the relief requested in this petition.

1 subject of this action. The District will amend this petition to state their true names and capacities

2 once they become known.

3 IV. LEGAL BACKGROUND

21. CEQA has two it primary purposes: it informs decision-makers and the public about

5 potential, significant environmental effects of a proposed action (CEQA Guidelines, §

6 15002(a)(1)), and it requires agencies minimize environmental damage when feasible.

7 22. CEQA requires that a lead agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of

8 a proposed action in an EIR except in limited circumstances not present here. Courts have called
the EIR the heart of CEQA and an "environmental 'alarm bell' whose purpose is to alert the

10 public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached the

11 ecological points of no return." (Bakersfield Citizens for Local Control v. City of Bakersfield
BARG COFFIN ddVäL 12 (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1184, 1214, 1220.) The EIR also functions as a "document of
13 accountability," intended to "demonstrate to an apprehensive citizenry that the lead agency has,
z s a 14 in fact, analyzed and considered the ecological implications of its action." (Laurel Heights
SIM37 15 Improvements Ass'n. v. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.) The EIR
AT T 16 process thus "protects not only the environment but also "informed self-government." (Pocket

17 Protectors v. City of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 903, 927.)

18 23. An EIR must contain a sufficient degree of analysis to allow decision-makers to

19 make an intelligent decision. The analysis in the EIR must be sufficient to connect the dots

20 between facts and conclusion; it may not include the lead agency's bare conclusions or opinions.
21 An EIR's analysis must be supported by substantial evidence, and not "argument, speculation,
22 unsubstantiated opinion or narrative [or] evidence which is clearly erroneous or inaccurate."

23 24. When it comes to water supply, "CEQA's informational purposes are not satisfied

24 by an EIR that simply ignores or assumes a solution to the problem of supplying water to a

25 proposed land use project. Decision-makers must, under the law, be presented with sufficient

26 facts to sevaluate the pros and cons' of supplying the amount of water that the [project] will
27 need." (Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth v City of Rancho Cordova ("Vineyard

28 Citizens ")(2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 431 [quoting Santiago County Water Dist. v. County of Orange

1

2

3 (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 818, 829].)] An EIR's water supply impact analysis must address

4 uncertainties regarding a project's water supplies, must identify a water source with a likelihood

5 of actually proving available, and must discuss possible replacement or alternative water sources.

25. If significant changes to the project or its circumstances

6 occur, or new information

7 becomes available, after a final EIR has been prepared but before it is certified as complete, the

8 agency must revise the EIR and recirculate it or the revised portions of it for public review and

9 comment. The standards for recirculation are similar to the standards for determining whether

has been certified.

10 changes or new information trigger a the need for a subsequent or supplemental EIR once an EIR

11 STATEMENT OF FACTS

A.

BARG COFFIN The District

C 12 26.

LEWIS & TRAI w 13

AT T N8I 14 The District is a publicly-owned utility established by California's Municipal

15 Utility District Act. The District's mission is to manage the natural resources with which the

16 District is entrusted; to provide reliable, high quality water and wastewater services at fair and

17 reasonable rates for the people of the East Bay; and to preserve and protect the environment for
future generations.

27.

18

19 The District's Ultimate Service Boundary (USB) defines the territory within

20 which it has planned to provide water service. The District's USB encompasses 332 square miles

21 and includes 20 cities, 15 unincorporated East Bay communities, and approximately 1.4 million

customers.

28.

22

23 The Project site is outside of the District's current USB, in an unincorporated part
of Contra Costa County.

29.

24 The District has policies ("Annexation Policies") that

25 govern annexation of new

26 territory into the USB. (See Annexation Policy 3.01 (effective November 24, 2015), 3.05

27 (effective April 26, 2016), and 3.08 (effective September 14, 2010), copies attached as Exhibit B

28 to this petition.) These policies are designed to ensure the District does not annex new territory
into its USB when doing so would threaten the District's ability to provide water service to
existing and future customers within its current USB.

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE / Contra Costa Superior Court Case No.: N21-1274

1 30. District's Annexation Policies guard against significant environmental impacts

2 flowing from the procurement of additional water supplies for areas the District is not planning to
service.

31. Of particular relevance, District Annexation Policy 3.05 ("Considerations for
Extension of Water Beyond the Ultimate Service Boundary') provides, "The District will not
extend water to areas outside the present Ultimate Service Boundary (USB) of the District, if

7 such extension would result in ... A reduction in the quantity of water available to District

8 customers to satisfy existing or projected levels of demand.... The phrase 'District customers'

9 shall mean (i) existing water service customers of the District and (ii) future customers, located

10 within the present USB, but not now receiving water service."

11 B. Project Description and Setting

BARG COFFIN LEWIS & TRAPF co 12 32.
A The Tassajara Parks Project involves (a) the construction of 125 single-family

w 13 residences on an approximately 30-acre site, and (b) additional acreage of grading, and
Z
8 14 infrastructure, including a detention basin.

15 33. Respondents' approval of the Project includes (a) expanding the County's Urban

16 Limit Line (ULL) to incorporate approximately 30 acres into a Residential Development area; (b)
17 amending the Land Use Element of the General Plan to designate the project site as Single-

18 Family Residential, High Density, Parks and Recreation, and Public/Semi-Public; (c) rezoning

19 the Project site accordingly; and (d) vesting a Tentative Map to subdivide the Project site into 125

20 single-family residential lots.

21 VI. ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS FOR THE PROJECT

22 A. Draft EIR

23 34. The County issued a draft EIR ("DEIR") on May 12, 2016, held a hearing on it on

24 June 6, 2016, and received public comments on it through July 18, 2016. The DEIR initially
25 identified two possible sources of water for the Project: purchasing supply from Calaveras Public

26 Utility District or annexation into the District's USB.

1 35.

3 On July 13, 2016, the District submitted written comments on the DEIR
2 identifying legal inadequacies and factual errors in the document. These comments included, but

4 were not limited to, the following:

a.

5

6 The DEIR failed to adequately disclose, analyze and mitigate impacts

7 resulting from the Project's inconsistency with the District's Annexation Policies
resulting in a "significant and unavoidable" impact under CEQA.
b.

8 The DEIR failed to adequately analyze the Project impacts to water

10 resources generally, including impacts to water supply, water quality, water infrastructure,
water demand, growth-inducing impacts, and alternative sources of water supply.

C.

11

LEWIS & TRAPP BARG COFFIN C 12 The DEIR over-estimated the feasibility of a recycled water offset as a

ATTORNE A 13 mitigation measure for the Project, and on that basis, erroneously concluded that the
Project's impacts were insignificant.

B.

14 36. Recirculated Draft EIR
The County issued a Recirculated DEIR ("RDEIR") (altering its water supply
15 evaluation) on September 29, 2016, held a hearing on it on November 14, 2016, and received
16 public comments on it through November 30, 2016.

17 37.

18

19 The RDEIR rejected the option of purchasing water from Calaveras Public Utility

20 District and identifies the District as the Project's water source. The RDEIR eliminated the

21 recycled water offset mitigation (that had been included in the DEIR) due to infeasibility. In its

22 place, the RDEIR stated Respondents intend "to augment EBMUD's potable water availability

23 by facilitating, accelerating and implementing conservation beyond currently planned levels

C.

24 within EBMUD's service area by an amount sufficient to offset the Project's water demand."

38. RDEIR's Treatment of Conflict with District's Annexation Policies

25 acknowledged that annexation to EBMUD's USB would require a corresponding expansion of

26 In assessing consistency with the District's Annexation Policies, the RDEIR

27 EBMUD's Sphere of Influence and both actions would be subject to LAFCO approval.
39. The RDEIR also stated that "the applicant would need to demonstrate that the
28 Project's water strategy is consistent with these policies, as determined by the EBMUD Board."

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE / Contra Costa Superior Court Case No.: N21-1274 8

1 40. The RDEIR, however, determined that implementation of Mitigation Measure

2 USS-1 [requiring the applicant to demonstrate the provision of adequate water supply via a will-

3 serve letter from EBMUD before the final map can be recorded] "would ensure that all EBMUD

4 annexation policies are adhered to and would reduce impacts to a less than significant level."

5 41. The RDEIR noted that "inconsistency with policies would cause a significant

6 environmental impact."

7 42. The RDEIR concluded that if the District's Board of Directors approves the

8 annexation, then there is no inconsistency that needs to be publicly disclosed or evaluated under

9 CEQA.

10 D. RDEIR's Treatment of Impacts to Water Supply

11 43. Regarding water supply, the RDEIR determined that off-site water conservation
BARG COFFIN ddVdl 8 SIM37 AENYOIL V 12 would involve either: (1) an expansion of EBMUD's existing potable water conservation

13 program by funding potable water conservation at a level beyond what EBMUD ultimately

14 approved on April 24, 2012, as part of its Water Supply Management Plan (*WSMP") 2040 Final

15 Plan, or (2) implementation of an acceleration or expansion of measures that were included in the

16 WSMP 2040 Final Plan but are not yet funded for implementation.

17 44. The RDEIR's water supply evaluation, at Appendix J, found that that
18 implementation of "Level E" conservation measures as described in the District's WSMP 2040

19 would conserve 2 million gallons per day (mgd) of water and offset the Project's increased water

20 demand. The RDEIR concluded that this amount was in excess of that needed to serve the

21 Project.

22 E. District's Comments on RDEIR

23 45. On November 21, 2016, the District submitted written comments detailing the

24 legal deficiencies and factual errors in the RDEIR. These comments included, but were not
25 limited to, the following:

26 46. The RDEIR failed to disclose that the Project "is inconsistent with these

27 [Annexation] Policies," which were adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an
28 environmental effect, and Respondents should have "identified a significant and unavoidable

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE / Contra Costa Superior Court Case No.: N21-1274

1

2 environmental impact" because the Project "conflict[s] with any applicable land use plan, policy,
or regulation."

3 47.

4

5 The RDEIR's determination that the District possesses sufficient water supply to

6 service the Project by "accelerating currently planned conservation" is arbitrary and not

7 supported by substantial evidence. The District noted that "[a]ccelerating water conservation

48.

8 programs is already required to ensure the District's ability to meet demand through year 2040."

water service infrastructure.

9 49. The RDEIR failed to adequately disclose and analyze the Project's impacts to

10

11 The RDEIR failed to adequately analyze the significant growth-inducing impacts

BARG COFFIN LEWIS & TRAPP C ATTORNEY 12 that Project might have on the greater area, including implications and impacts of obtaining water
sources for potential growth.

50.

13

14 The RDEIR rejected the alternative of obtaining water from Calaveras Public
Utility District but failed to meaningfully evaluate any alternative source of water supply except
for provision by EBMUD.

15 F.

16 2020 Final EIR

51. The County issued the Final EIR ("FEIR"), comprised of the RDEIR, Appendices,
17 Master Responses and Responses to Written Comments on the RDEIR and Draft EIR, Changes

18

19 to the a RDEIR and a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program on September 14, 2020.

52. Regarding the District's Annexation Policies, the FEIR erroneously found the
20 "proposed project can, in fact, be determined consistent with said policies." It states that "a

21

22

23 definitive interpretation of the Project's consistency must be made by the EBMUD Board of

24 Directors, who are the District's policy and decision makers." The FEIR also concluded that
impacts to water resources were less than significant under CEQA.

53. In its September 29, 2020 comments on the FEIR, the District reiterated its
25 continued opposition to annexation and noted that the FEIR violates CEQA by failing to: a)
26 analyze whether the Project can realistically obtain a water supply; b) meaningfully describe and

27

28 analyze water conservation measures and c) disclose the conflict with the District's Annexation
Policies which results in a "significant and unavoidable impact" under CEQA.

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE / Contra Costa Superior Court Case No.: N21-1274 10

1 54. The District also identified several of the FEIR's findings which are not supported

2 by substantial evidence, including but not limited to: (a) an inadequate water supply evaluation

3 which conflicts with the analysis of the District (i.e., the very agency the FEIR relies upon to

4 supply the water); and (b) a flawed water demand estimate.

5 G. Changed Circumstances Prior to FEIR Certification

6 55. Since the issuance of the FEIR, California has entered an historic drought fueled

7 by human-caused climate change, which exacerbates drought cycles. California's current

8 drought is likely to persist. The District's recently-released Draft Urban Water Management Plan
(*UWMP") 2020 identifies a substantial increase in USB-wide demand over the next thirty years

10 and several thousand acre-feet in unmet need for existing customers in times of drought in the

11 future.

BARG COFFIN ddVdl 8 LEWIS Cb 12 56.
A On April 27, 2021, the District Board issued a Stage One drought declaration,

13 finding the District's water supplies insufficient to meet existing customer demand within its
ATTORN 14 USB, establishing a rationing goal of 10 percent, declaring the need to purchase supplemental

15 water supplies and directing staff to promote customer water conservation. (See Exhibit C, a true

16 copy of Resolution No. 35222-21, the "Drought Declaration.") Since April 27, 2021, the

17 District's water supply projections for 2021 have further plummeted by 65-70 thousand acre-feet.

18 57. Dry conditions in the State have led to other State level directives - the State

19 Water Resources Control Board's water curtailment actions and Central Valley Project water

20 supply cutbacks - that further limit the District's water supply.

21 58. In a May 27, 2021 letter to the County, the District informed Respondents that the

22 April 27, 2021 Drought Declaration constituted significant new information and a changed

23 circumstance affecting the Project that was not previously disclosed to the public or analyzed in

24 any environmental document and that recirculation of the FEIR was required.

25 59. On June 8, 2021, the District's Board passed Resolution No. 35229-21 (attached

26 as Exhibit A, the "June 8 Resolution") opposing annexation of the Project because the District
27  "must reserve all sources of water supply available to mitigate water supply deficiencies it

28 experiences during droughts and to address the potential impacts of other stressors and

11

N 14 of water to serve the Project; (3) the Project is inconsistent with the County General Plan; and (4)

ATTC 15 "overwhelming opposition" to the Project from members of the public. On July 13, 2021, the
County Board of Supervisors acted contrary to the Planning Commission recommendation and
approved the Project and certified the FEIR.

19 Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by serving

20 on August 11, 2021 a written notice of Petitioner's intent to commence this action against

63.

21 Respondents. A copy of the written notice is attached to this petition as Exhibit D.

22 Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law
unless this Court grants the relief requested below.

64.

23

24 Petitioner brings this action pursuant to Public Resources Code sections 21168
and 21168.5, as well as Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, which require that a
lead agency's approval of a Project be set aside if the lead agency has prejudicially abused its
25 discretion. Prejudicial abuse of discretion occurs either where a lead agency has failed to proceed

26

27

28 a in a manner required by law or where its determination or decision is not supported by substantial
evidence. Respondents have prejudicially abused their discretion because the County's findings

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE / Contra Costa Superior Court Case No.: N21-1274 12

1 are not supported by substantial evidence and the County failed to comply with the procedural

2 and substantive requirements of CEQA.

20 (VIOLATIONS OF CEQA; failure to proceed in manner required by law)

21 70. Petitioner incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth above.
22 71. CEQA requires lead agency for project to prepare an EIR that complies with
23 the requirements of the statute.
24 72. In approving this Project, Respondents certified an EIR that fails to comply with
25 CEQA in the following ways:
26 a. Failed to a provide a stable and consistent Project description, including a
27 viable source of water;
28

C. Improperly deferred impact analysis and mitigation measures;

d. Failed to adequately analyze the cumulative and growth-inducing impacts

5 of the Project;

6 e. Failed to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's impacts to water

7 resources; and

8 f. Failed to adequately analyze an alternate source of water for the Project.
73. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their

10 discretion by certifying an EIR that does not comply with CEQA and approving the Project in

11 a reliance on a defective EIR. Accordingly, Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of

13 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION (VIOLATION OF CEQA; Failure to Recirculate EIR) z 14 8 c 74. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth
011 V 15
above.
16
75. CEQA requires that if significant new information arises before certification of an 17
EIR, the EIR must be amended and recirculated for public review and comment. 18
76. Comments submitted to Respondents before certification of the EIR raised 19
significant new information regarding the absence of a water supply for the Project. 20
77. Respondents failed to amend or recirculate the EIR, and the public was deprived 21
of an opportunity to meaningfully comment on water-supply-related impacts. 22
78. Therefore, Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and their 23

24 certification of the EIR is not supported by substantial evidence.

RESOLUTION NO. 35229-21 Lnlas Cole
Secretary
East Bay Municipal Utility District
DECLARING EAST BAY MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT'S (DISTRICT) OPPOSITION
TO ANNEXING THE TASSAJARA PARKS PROJECT INTO THE DISTRICT'S SERVICE
AREA, FINDING THE PROJECT INCONSISTENT WITH THE DISTRICT'S ANNEXATION
POLICIES, AND MAKING FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS REGARDING THE
UNAVAILABILITY OF WATER TO SERVE THE PROJECT

Introduced by Director Patterson Seconded by Director Mellon

WHEREAS, Contra Costa County (County) is considering approving the Tassajara Parks Project (Project), a proposed 125-unit single family residential development in unincorporated County territory, outside the County's Urban Limit Line; and
WHEREAS, the Project is outside but adjacent to the District's service area, Ultimate Service Boundary (USB), and Sphere of Influence; and
WHEREAS, the USB defines the geographic area within which the District has planned to provide water service to existing and future customers; and
WHEREAS, due to the Project's location outside the USB, the District has not planned to provide
it with water service; and

WHEREAS, as set forth in District Policy 3.05 - Considerations for Extension of Water Beyond the Ultimate Service Boundary, it is the policy of this Board of Directors (Board) that the District shall not extend water to areas outside the current USB if such extension would result in a
reduction in the quantity or quality of water available to serve present and future customers within the USB or an increase in the costs of service; and
WHEREAS, as set forth in District Policy 3.01 - Annexations, it is further the policy of this Board to oppose annexations outside the current USB unless several enumerated conditions are
met; and

WHEREAS, as set forth in District Policy 3.08 - Advisory Election for Annexations Outside the Contra Costa County Urban Limit Line, it is further the policy of this Board to oppose annexations of proposed residential developments of less than 200 units located outside the County's Urban Limit Line that are inconsistent with Policy 3.01; and
WHEREAS, based on these Policies, throughout the County's environmental review process for the Project, the District has stated its opposition to annexing the Project into its service area; and
WHEREAS, despite the District's opposition to annexing the Project, the County has consistently assumed the District would provide water service to the Project; and
WHEREAS, the County's Final Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the Project, published in September 2020, assumed the District would provide water service to the Project based on a proposed offsite water conservation offset (Proposal), under which the Project would fund water

L

conservation programs throughout the District's service area to offset the Project's water demand; and

WHEREAS, the Proposal relies on implementation of water conservation programs, a component of the District's water supplies available to meet the needs of current and future customers within the current USB; and
WHEREAS, as a long-time leader in water conservation, the District has engaged in a decades- long, comprehensive effort in water conservation throughout its service area, and its efforts to promote water conservation include, but are not limited to:
(a) adopting a Water Conservation Master Plan in 1994, specifying water conservation strategies for building on the District's then-existing water conservation efforts and
creating a pathway for future water conservation through expanding rebates and incentives and providing conservation information to its customers. The Master Plan
was updated in 201 1-- to extend the planning horizon to 2040-- and is currently in the
process of being updated again;
(b) sponsoring legislation to ensure that land use planning takes into account the availability of adequate water supplies for proposed new development before the development is approved. These efforts included SB 901 (1995) to require water supply assessments, and SB 221 and SB 610 in 2001 to further improve upon the water supply assessment process;

(c) adopting its own water efficiency and wise water use requirements through Sections 29 and 31 of its Board-adopted Regulations Governing Water Service to Customers of East
Bay Municipal Utility District;
(d) implementing a long-running water conservation education program, including school education efforts beginning in 1974, writing and publishing large format books
promoting water conservation, and engaging with the public regarding water
conservation by maintaining water conservation demonstration gardens, staffing water conservation displays at community events, and organizing and sponsoring the annual Water Conservation Showcase since 2004, which event brings together representatives from water agencies, industry, government, and nonprofits to discuss pressing water issues and learn about new water conservation technologies and solutions;
(e) incentivizing water conservation through a fully staffed, permanent, year-in, year-out
water conservation program, with a cumulative budget now totaling over $100 million, and including measures such as water conservation rebate and incentive programs and distribution of water conservation devices to customers; and
WHEREAS, water conservation has long been a key component of the District's water supply portfolio, pursuant to which the District (1) achieved approximately 46 million gallons per day (MGD) in wäter conservation savings between 1995 and 2018 and (2) continues to pursue further expansion of its already-robust water conservation program; and
WHEREAS, remaining water conservation potential within the District's USB is an important

2

tool the District can and does use to address the impacts of water supply deficiencies on its customers; and

WHEREAS, the Final EIR generally failed to analyze the feasibility of the Proposal and specifically failed to assess whether and to what extent depleting the District's remaining water conservation potential would jeopardize the District's ability to meet the needs of current and future customers within the District's current USB; and
WHEREAS, the District submitted to the County detailed comments on the Final EIR, objecting to the County's failure to analyze the feasibility of the Proposal, explaining the Project's inconsistency with the District's Board-adopted Policies regarding annexation of new service territory, and stating the District's opposition to annexing the Project into its service area; and
WHEREAS, following publication of the Final EIR, District staff engaged in discussions with County staff and the Project developer's team regarding the feasibility of Proposal; and
WHEREAS, the Project developer's team prepared an assessment addressing in part the technical and economic feasibility of the Proposal; and
WHEREAS, the Project developer's assessment did not address the effect of the Proposal on the District's ability to serve current and future customers within the current USB; and
WHEREAS, current drought conditions prevailing throughout much of California have highlighted the importance of protecting all of the District's water supplies-including supplies created through water conservation-for current and future District customers within the current USB; and

WHEREAS, 2021 has thus far been the second driest year on record in the Mokelumne River basin, where most of the District's water supplies originate; and
WHEREAS, 2021 has thus far been the driest year on record for the East Bay; and
WHEREAS, the snow depth at Caples Lake, a Mokelumne basin snow survey reference point, was at 52 percent of average as of April 19, 2021 and the California Department of Water Resources' Bulletin 120 forecast of the forecasted runoff on the Mokelumne River is at 42
percent of average; and

WHEREAS, on March 22, 2021, the State Water Resources Control Board sent a warning letter to the District and other water rights holders which noted the unusually dry conditions prevailing throughout California, and urged water rights holders to begin planning for potential water supply shortages by taking actions such as increasing water conservation and diversifying water supply portfolios; and
WHEREAS, on April 27, 2021, based on the projected impact of the prevailing dry conditions on the District's water supplies, this Board declared the District's water supplies deficient for meeting customer demands, declared a Stage drought, established a District-wide ten percent rationing goal, declared the need to purchase supplemental supplies, and directed District staff to take actions to promote customer water conservation; and

3

WHEREAS. since this Board's April 27, 2021 drought-related actions, the District's water supply projections for this water year have continued to decline, with the District's anticipated end-of-September storage levels now 65-70 thousand acre-feet lower than previously projected; and

WHEREAS, as demonstrated in this year's drought and other droughts in recent years, the District's water supplies are not sufficient to meet customer demand in times of drought, requiring the District to purchase supplemental supplies and impose water rationing requirements on its customers; and
WHEREAS, dry year deficiencies in the District's supplies are expected to persist, and the District's Draft Urban Water Management Plan 2020 identifies both a substantial increase in USB-wide demand over the next thirty years, and several thousand acre-feet in unmet need for water in times of drought in the future; and
WHEREAS, in addition to drought, many other stressors threaten to reduce the amount of water available to District customers now and in the future, including climate change, future regulatory actions, and cutbacks in the availability of water to the District under its Central Valley Project (CVP) contract with the United States Department of Interior Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation); and
WHEREAS, the District's Urban Water Management Plan 2015 estimated that climate change could result in a several thousand acre-foot increase in the District's unmet need for water by the year 2040; and

WHEREAS, climate change may also result in more frequent and severe droughts in the future;
and

WHEREAS, the State Water Resources Control Board's efforts to update the Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan have thus far focused on improving Bay-Delta water quality by significantly increasing instream flow requirements on tributary rivers to the Bay-Delta, like the Mokelumne River, where most of the District's water supplies originate; and
WHEREAS, the Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan Update is likely to increase the District's Mokelumne River instream flow obligations by tens of thousands of acre-feet per year, adding a significant new constraint on the District's water supplies that could impair its ability to meet customer demands in the future; and
WHEREAS, during the last drought, the State of California directly involved itself in local water management, both by issuing curtailment orders requiring water rights holders like the District to divert less water, and by promulgating emergency regulations dictating reductions in customer demand; and

WHEREAS, 2014 and 2015 curtailment orders required the District to bypass approximately 76 thousand acre-feet of water on the Mokelumne River that would have otherwise been available to
serve its customers; and
WHEREAS, the State of California could take similar actions this year and in future droughts,

4

requiring the District to achieve short-term reductions in water consumption and reducing the availability of Mokelumne River water for District customers; and
WHEREAS, in addition to customer rationing, the District's CVP contract provides a key source
of supply to meet customer demands during droughts; and
WHEREAS, during the 2014-15 drought, CVP allocations were cut to only 25% for Municipal and Industrial contractors like the District, significantly reducing the amount of CVP water available to the District and forcing the District to purchase supplemental supplies on the spot water transfers market; and
WHEREAS, securing supplemental supplies on the spot transfers market in 2015 was both challenging and expensive, with spot transfer water prices seven to ten times higher than CVP water prices; and
WHEREAS, on May 26, 2021, Reclamation indicated the District's CVP allocation would again be cut to 25%, thus dramatically reducing the amount of CVP water available to address the
District's drought-induced water supply deficiencies this year; and
WHEREAS, because of the late date on which CVP cutbacks were announced, it is very unlikely the District will be able to purchase water on the spot transfers market, as most available water has already been purchased by other parties; and
WHEREAS, CVP allocations could be similarly reduced in future droughts, and there are no assurances that supplemental water will be available on the spot transfers market to replace the District's reduced CVP supplies, potentially leaving the District without adequate supplies to meet customer demands; and
WHEREAS, given the existing and predicted future deficiencies in the District's water supplies during droughts, and other threats and stressors on those supplies, the District must adhere to its policies regarding the annexation of new service territory; and
WHEREAS, offsetting the Project's demand through conservation programs would take "new water" created through those programs away from District customers within the USB, thereby violating Policy 3.05 by reducing the quantity of water available to those customers; and
WHEREAS, the Project is located entirely outside the USB, would result in the addition of more than 100 residential units outside the is USB, and is inconsistent with Policy 3.05, such that (1) the Project does not meet Policy 3.01's enumerated conditions for annexation of territory outside the USB, and (2) annexation of the Project would therefore be inconsistent with Policy 3.01; and
WHEREAS, because the Project is less than 200 units in size, is located outside the County's Urban Limit Line, and is inconsistent with Policy 3.01, it also does not comply with Policy 3.08;
and

WHEREAS, the District has a legal obligation to provide adequate water service to all members
of the community within its service area; and

5

WHEREAS, given the deficiencies in the District's water supplies in times of drought, the potential threats to those supplies, and the anticipated growth in water demand within the USB, the District cannot afford to dedicate any water available to it-including new water supplies created through water conservation programs--to a proposed development outside its current service area, and outside the USB;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Board of Directors of the East Bay Municipal Utility District finds, determines and declares the following:

1. The Board finds the above recitals to be true and correct.

2. The Board hereby finds and declares the District has not planned to serve the Project and does not have adequate water supplies to support the proposed annexation of the Project into the District's service area.

3. The Board hereby finds and declares the District must reserve all sources of water supply available to mitigate water supply deficiencies it experiences during droughts and to address the potential impacts of other stressors and constraints on its water supplies.

4. The Board hereby finds and declares that serving the Project using water created through implementation of conservation programs throughout the District's service area is not feasible because doing so would take a source of water supply away from existing and future customers within the USB, thereby exacerbating deficiencies in the District's water supplies during droughts.

5. The Board hereby finds and declares that the proposed annexation of the Project is inconsistent with District Policies 3.01 and 3.05 and does not comply with Policy 3.08.

6

6. The Board hereby declares the District (a) is opposed to annexing the Project into its service area and (b) does not intend to serve the Project.

ADVISORY ELECTION FOR ANNEXATIONS SUPERSEDES 14 OCT 08
OUTSIDE THE CONTRA COSTA COUNTY
URBAN LIMIT LINE

IT IS THE POLICY OF THE EAST BAY MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT TO:

Call an advisory election if EBMUD is designated as the preferred water service provider by a local planning agency in its environmental documentation when the proposed development is located outside the Urban Limit Line adopted by Contra Costa County in 2000.

Purpose The purpose of the election shall be to submit to the voters within the EBMUD
service area the question of whether territory outside said Urban Limit Line should be annexed to EBMUD. to

Events Triggering •
an Advisory EBMUD is identified by a local planning agency in its environmental
Election documentation as the preferred provider to deliver potable water service to a residential development of 200 or more dwelling units located in territory beyond the Contra Costa County Urban Limit Line. In such cases, the matter shall be placed on the agenda for consideration by the Board of Directors at a regularly scheduled public meeting. If the Board of Directors determines not to oppose annexation of such territory to EBMUD, EBMUD shall call an advisory election on the question of whether such territory should be annexed to EBMUD. The advisory election shall occur prior to the time the Contra Costa County Local Agency Formation Commission is scheduled to consider annexation of the territory to EBMUD and, when possible, shall be consolidated with a general election.

If a local agency designates EBMUD as the preferred provider for water service to a residential development in territory outside the Contra Costa County Urban Limit Line that is less than 200 dwelling units and is not covered by the IS provisions of Policy 3.01, then EBMUD shall oppose the annexation and the Board of Directors shall determine, at a regularly scheduled public meeting, whether to call an advisory election on the question of whether such territory should be annexed to EBMUD.

PROJECT AND TO DIVERT SUCH SUPPLIES AT THE FREEPORT FACILITIES,
AND DIRECTING FURTHER MEASURES TO PROMOTE WATER CONSERVATION

Introduced by Director Coleman ; Seconded by Director Patterson

WHEREAS, dry conditions currently prevail throughout much of California, including within the Mokelumne River basin and the East Bay; and
WHEREAS, 2021 has thus far been the second driest year on record in the Mokelumne River basin and the driest year on record for the East Bay; and
WHEREAS, the snow depth at Caples Lake, a Mokelumne basin snow survey reference point, is at 52 percent of average as of April 19, and the California Department of Water Resources' April Bulletin 120 forecast of the forecasted runoff on the Mokelumne River is at 43 percent of average; and
WHEREAS, the current weather forecast predicts precipitation within the Mokelumne River watershed which is below the historical median for the forecasted period, and long-term precipitation forecasting models do not currently predict a likelihood of above-normal
precipitation during the remainder of the spring; and
WHEREAS, on March 22, 2021, the State Water Resources Control Board sent a warning letter to East Bay Municipal Utility District (District) and other water rights holders which noted the unusually dry conditions prevailing throughout California, and urged water rights holders to begin planning for potential water supply shortages by taking actions such as increasing water conservation and diversifying water supply portfolios; and
WHEREAS, the District has undertaken substantial investments in comprehensive water conservation programs, water recycling projects, and dry year supplemental water supply projects to help reduce the severity of water rationing that may be required in multi-year droughts, and will continue doing so; and
WHEREAS, following adoption of its Water Conservation Master Plan in 1994 through the year
2018. the District achieved approximately 46 million gallons per day in estimated customer conservation savings and anticipates achieving up to 66 to 74 million gallons per day in conservation savings by the year 2050; and
WHEREAS, the District provided recycled water customers with over 6 million gallons per day of recycled water for nonpotable uses in 2020 and continues to pursue further expansions of its recycled water program; and

WHEREAS, on April 27, 2021, the 2021 Water Supply Availability and Deficiency Report was filed with the District's Board of Directors (Board) in accordance with District Policy 9.03, and

the Board declared the District's water supply will be deficient for meeting customer demand after all required releases to the Lower Mokelumne River have been made; and
WHEREAS, despite the District's long-running, aggressive water conservation program and its
utilization of recycled water supplies, the current dry conditions and the District's deficient water
supplies require consideration of customer water use reductions and the purchase of supplemental water supplies by the District; and
WHEREAS, the District's Water Shortage Contingency Plan and Drought Management Program provide recommendations regarding potential drought response actions to help the District
continue to meet customer water demand; and
WHEREAS, because precipitation has consistently trended well below the historical median for
an extended time, because concern is growing statewide regarding the ongoing dry conditions, and because it is important to use appropriately conservative water supply projections when formulating drought response actions, it is reasonable and prudent to project the District's end- of-September total system storage based upon the assumption that conditions in the Mokelumne watershed will remain dry relative to the historical median for the remainder of the precipitation season, as reflected by the 90 percent exceedance water supply projection; and
WHEREAS, on April 22, 2021, the District's projected end-of-September total system storage was 475,000 acre-feet based on a 90 percent exceedance; and
WHEREAS, the District's current Drought Management Program guidelines recommend
declaration of a Stage 1 Drought whenever projected end-of-September total system storage falls between 450,000 acre-feet and 500,000 acre-feet; and
WHEREAS, the District's current Drought Management Program guidelines also recommend voluntary customer demand reductions of up to 15 percent in a Stage 1 Drought; and
WHEREAS, as part of its draft Water Shortage Contingency Plan 2020 currently out for public
review and comment, the District has proposed changes to its current Drought Management Program, referred to herein as the District's Proposed Drought Management Program; and
WHEREAS, when projected end-of-September total system storage falls between 425,000 acre- feet and 475,000 acre-feet, the Proposed Drought Management Program recommends declaration
of a Stage 1 Drought, purchase of supplemental supplies, and voluntary customer demand
reductions of up to 10 percent; and
WHEREAS, the drought response actions recommended in both the District's current and Proposed Drought Management Program are intended to guide, but not constrain, District drought response actions, particularly where the District's projected end-of-September total system storage approaches the total system storage thresholds demarcating the various drought stages set forth in the Drought Management Program; and

2

WHEREAS, given the current end-of-September total system storage projection of 475,000 acre- feet, it would be appropriate under the recommendations found in either the current or the Proposed Drought Management Program to: (i) declare : Stage 1 Drought, (ii) establish a District-wide voluntary 10 percent customer demand reduction goal and implement other voluntary measures to promote increased water conservation, and (iii) purchase supplemental supplies; and
WHEREAS, the District has a permanent repayment contract with the United States Bureau of Reclamation under which the District is entitled to purchase Central Valley Project water as a supplemental supply in any contract year in which the District's May forecast of its October 1 total system storage is less than 500,000 acre-feet based on a 50 percent exceedance, or any different reasonable exceedance used by the District to declare rationing within its service arca, said supplemental supplies to be diverted at the Freeport Regional Water Project Facilities (Freeport Facilities); and
WHEREAS, the District reasonably anticipates it will be entitled to take Central Valley Project water during the 2021 contract year under the terms of its permanent repayment contract; and
WHEREAS, given the above-referenced dry conditions, the deficiency of available supplies, and anticipated entitlement to take Central Valley Project water, the District intends to purchase up to 58,000 acre-feet of water under its Central Valley Project contract and divert the purchased water at the Freeport Facilities during the current Central Valley Project contract year which ends on February 28, 2022; and

WHEREAS, the District diverts its Central Valley Project supplies at the Freeport Facilities at the rate of approximately 8,300 acre-feet a month, and the additional cost to purchase, convey, treat, and deliver 8,300 acre-fect of Central Valley Project water is approximately $4 million per month, resulting in an estimated $28 million cost associated with obtaining and delivering Central Valley Project water to the District's customers through the end of the current Central Valley Project contract year; and
WHEREAS, the District's Fiscal Year 2022 reserves are adequate to cover the estimated cost of purchasing, treating and delivering supplemental water supplies from the Central Valley Project in the remainder of Fiscal Year 2022; and
WHEREAS, the declaration of a Stage 1 Drought, establishment of a voluntary 10 percent customer demand reduction goal and other voluntary measures to promote water conservation, and acquisition of supplemental water supplies will enable the District to continue meeting the water supply needs of its customers;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Board of Directors of the East Bay Municipal Utility District finds and determines and hereby declares the following:

1. The Board finds the above recitals to be true and correct.

2. The Board hereby declares a Stage 1 Drought.

3. The Board hereby establishes a District-wide voluntary 10 percent customer demand reduction goal.

4. The Board authorizes and directs District staff to review the proposed Stage 1 Drought response actions described in the District's approved Water Shortage Contingency Plan and implement such actions described therein as staff deems appropriate, including initiating a public information campaign and offering expanded services which promote customer water conservation.

5. The Board hereby declares a need to purchase up to 58,000 acre-feet of supplemental water supplies from the United States Bureau of Reclamation during the current Central Valley Project contract year and to use the Freeport Facilities to divert such supplies for delivery to the District's service area.

6. The General Manager or his designee is hereby authorized and directed to take such other actions as may be necessary to effectuate this Resolution.
