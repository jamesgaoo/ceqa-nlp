Petition for Writ of Mandamus 1

1 Laguna Beach is acknowledged by the National Park Service as a Historic a

2 American Landscape. The City Council's land use discretion extends to permits to

3 enlarge century-old homes in its historic neighborhoods, subject to environmental
4

5 review. Here, however, it relied on a "categorical exemption" from any CEQA review,

6 relying on the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties.

7 Experts, including Historic Resources Group engaged by the city, concluded

8 that plans to substantially alter the historic home on Hawthorne Road would not meet
9

10 the Secretary's Standards. Even following revisions, the project's lack of compliance with

11 the Standards remained "egregious," foretelling significant adverse impacts. The city

12 nonetheless approved the project without any environmental review.

13 The Alliance respectfully requests judgment and a peremptory writ to require
14

15 that the city set aside all approvals of the 369 Hawthorne Road project and reconsider

16 approval only after adequate environmental review and full compliance with CEQA.

17

18 Jurisdiction

19 2. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code section 21168

20 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. The parties and affected historic resources
21

22 lie within the City of Laguna Beach and the County of Orange.

23
Parties
24

25 3. Petitioner Historic Architecture Alliance is an unincorporated association

26 formed in the public interest following the city's approvals of the expansive project at
27 369 Hawthorne Road. Its mission is to advocate for compliance with local and state law
28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 2

1 protecting historic architecture in Laguna Beach and its environs. Alliance members

2 enjoy and appreciate the city's historic resources, including those at 369 Hawthorne

3 Road. The Alliance brings this petition on behalf of all others similarly situated and too
4

5 numerous to be named and brought before this Court as petitioners. Members of the

6 Alliance, including Dennis Sundman, objected to the approvals of the Hawthorne Road

7 project and exhausted administrative remedies.

8 4. Petitioner Laguna Beach Historic Preservation Coalition is an
9

10 unincorporated association formed in the public interest prior to 2020, before the

11 approval of the 369 Hawthorne Road project. Its mission is to preserve and protect the

12 historic fabric of Laguna. Association members enjoy and appreciate the city's historic

13 resources, including those on Hawthorne Road. The Coalition brings this petition on
14

15 behalf of all others similarly situated and too numerous to be named and brought

16 before this Court as petitioners. The Coalition and its members objected to the city's

17 approvals of the Hawthorne Road project and exhausted their administrative remedies.

18 5. Respondents City of Laguna Beach and its City Council (collectively, the
19 city) is the governmental body that approved the 369 Hawthorne Road project. It is the
20

21 lead agency responsible for CEQA administration, compliance, and implementation of

22 city policies and programs and ordinances protecting historic resources.

23 6. Real parties in interest Ian and Cherlin Kirby are the owners of the
24 property at 369 Hawthorne Road in Laguna Beach, and an adjacent home, and are the
25

26 project sponsors. Todd Skenderian is the project architect. As he is named as the project

27 applicant in the city's Notice of Exemption, the Public Resources Code requires that

28 petitioners name him as a real party in interest. Upon his request, petitioners may

1 dismiss Mr. Skenderian from this action if all parties agree that he is not indispensable.

2 7. Does 1 to 10 are fictitiously-named petitioners and real parties in interest
3 whose true names and capacities are unknown to petitioners. If and when true names
4

5 and capacities are known, petitioners will amend this petition to assert them.

6 8. A copy of this petition has been mailed to the California Attorney General.

7

8 General Allegations

9 9. The paragraphs below refer to and rely on information in documents that
10 will be lodged with this Court as part of the record of proceedings. 11

12 Environmental Setting
13

14 10. Laguna Beach is honored with recognition by the National Park Service as

15 a Historic American Landscape. As stated by historian Karen Turnbull, "Laguna Beach

16 contains a myriad of residential and commercial building styles all with the mark of
17 charm and individuality that has been popular in the city through the decades .... The 18

19 older homes and buildings in the city form both an important part of the local history

20 and serve as an important component of the quality and character of Laguna Beach."

21 11. According to the city's Historic Resources Inventory, the home at 369
22 Hawthorne Road "was originally constructed in 1925 and is identified as a Colonial
23

24 Revival style of architecture with gabled roof and shingled siding. The front of the

25 house is perpendicular to the street and is assumed that the orientation was to

26 maximize a once panoramic ocean view. A porte cochére is on the side (street facing

27 elevation) which echoes the treatment of the entry portico. The inventory description
28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 4

1 notes that the wide posts and a stepped parapet characterize the portico. Six-over-six

2 double-hung windows on both the first and second stories comprise the fenestration.

3 An ornamental chimney rises from the porte cochére along the side of the house."
4
12.
5 The subject property was listed on the city's Historic Register in 2014 as a

6 "K"rated structure. It is protected by the city's Historic Preservation Program and the

7 Historic Resources Element of the General Plan.

8

9 Project Description

10 13. Real parties propose a major remodel that requires city Design Review
11

12 approval and a Coastal Development Permit. The project proposes additions at the first

13 and second stories (1,020 square feet) that would be more than 50% greater than the

14 existing structure and that also include a 437 square-foot attached two-car garage,

15 174 square-foot elevated deck, pool, spa, pedestrian entry feature, and hardscaping.
16

17 The proposed project requires approval of alterations to a "K" rated historic registered

18 property and a historic preservation incentive (maintain existing nonconforming roof

19 height) in the R-2 (Residential Medium Density) zone. A Revocable Encroachment

20 Permit is required for enhanced paving in the Hawthorne Road public right-of-way.
21

22 Administrative Process and Approval

23 14. The city's Design Review Board staff report recited that the project
24

25 qualified as categorically exempt under CEQA Guidelines Section 15331, Class 31

26 (Historical Resource Restoration/Rehabilitation), "which allows maintenance, repair,

27 stabilization, rehabilitation, restoration, preservation, conservation or reconstruction of

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 5

1 historical resources in a manner consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards

2 for the Treatment of Historic Properties."

3 15. Following a public hearing, the Design Review Board approved the project

5 coastal development permit, design review, encroachment permit, and the Class 31

6 categorical exemption from CEQA on a vote of 4-1. City resident and project neighbor

7 Dennis Sundman appealed the approvals to the City Council based on violations of

8 CEQA's protections for historic resources and the lack of substantial evidence to
9

10 support the city's findings for alterations to an historic resource, neighborhood
11 compatibility, privacy, and view equity.

12 16. The City Council held a public hearing on the appeal on December 1, 2020.

13 | Testimony at the hearing included evidence that the project, as had been revised
14

15 during the administrative processes, continued to be out of compliance with the

16 Secretary's Standards and did not merit a Class 31 categorical exemption. The record also

17 included evidence that the city could not rely on a categorical exemption in light of

18 substantial evidence supporting a 'fair argument' that the project would have a
19 significant impact on a qualified historic resource listed on the city's Register. (See, e.g., 20

21 Berkeley Hillside Preservation v City of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1086, 1117; Valley

22 Advocates v. City of Fresno (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1039, 1072.) Among those providing

23 fair argument evidence was Architectural Historian Francesca Smith, who provided a
24 detailed fact-based report that pointed out the project's significant impacts and
25

26 criticized the city's failure to obtain qualified expert review. Ms. Smith concluded:

27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 6

1 CEQA Guidelines provide that project like the one under consideration

2 that would demolish and alter those physical characteristics of the historical

3 resource that convey its historical significance, including its character-

4 defining features is considered to materially impair the significance of the

5 resource. Because the proposed project would not conform to the Standards

6 for Rehabilitation and could be expected to [result in ]"material impairment"
to the historical resource, a focused Environmental Impact [Report]
7 should be prepared to analyze those impacts, seek ways to avoid or reduce
8 those impacts and mitigate any remaining impacts. Please vote to uphold the
9 appeal and deny the project.
10

11 Further support for the appeal was provided in another detailed written report

12 and testimony by Laguna Beach Historic Preservation Coalition representative
13

14 Catherine Jurca. Dr. Jurca underscored among other things that the project's significant

15 historic resource impacts violative of the Secretary's Standards had been pointed out by

16 the city's consultant Historic Resources Group (HRG) for a prior similar project and

17 remained outstanding and unaddressed by city staff. "It is possible to add on to the
18

19 residence, but it will only comply with the Standards it if is done in line with the spirit

20 and letter of HRG's suggestions . [T]he addition will have to shrink."

21 17. The City Council denied the appeal and approved the project. No appeal

22 to the California Coastal Commission is available for the Coastal Development Permit.

23
18. The city filed a Notice of Exemption from CEQA on December 18, 2020,
24
triggering a 35 day statute of limitations. By agreement, to allow for settlement
25

26 discussions all parties agreed to toll the statute of limitations for two weeks, until

27 February 5, 2021. This petition is ripe for review and is timely filed.
28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 7

1 19. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary

2 course of law. Issuance of a peremptory writ is imperative to avoid irreparable harm to
3 Laguna Beach residents and the city's environment via physical harm to the historic
4

5 resource at 369 Hawthorne Road. The city has the capacity to correct its violations of

6 law but has failed and refused to do sO.

7
Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act

9 20. Petitioners incorporate all paragraphs as if fully set forth.
10
21. CEQA requires agencies to conduct a prescribed, public environmental
11

12 review process, beginning with an Initial Study, before taking discretionary action that

13 a may have a significant adverse environmental impact. The process informs the public

14 and provides necessary information to allow elected officials and decisionmakers to
15 comply with CEQA's substantive mandate: to adopt feasible project mitigations and
16

17 alternatives that can reduce a project's significant environmental impacts.

18 22. The city abused its discretion and failed to act in the manner required by

19 law in approving the substantial alteration of 369 Hawthorne Road based on a

20 categorical exemption from CEQA, without preparing an Initial Study or conducting
21

22 an environmental review process. The city's actions were not supported by substantial

23 evidence that the project met Class 31 requirements for categorical exemption. Further,

24 a categorical exemption cannot be used for a project that may cause a substantial

25 adverse change in the significance of a historical resource, and the record contains a fair
26

27 argument that the project will result in just such adverse change.

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 8

1 WHEREFORE, petitioners pray:

2. 1. That the a Court issue judgment and a peremptory writ of mandamus

3 ordering the city respondents to set aside all actions and approvals relating to the
4

5 project at 369 Hawthorne Road, requiring that before further consideration of approval

6 the city prepare an Initial Study and conduct an adequate environmental review

7 process in which it analyzes project impacts, identifies and adopts feasible mitigation

8 measures and alternatives to lessen or avoid environmental impacts, and makes all
9

10 findings required by CEQA, supported by substantial evidence;

11 2. That the Court enjoin the city and real parties and their employees and

12 agents from all physical construction or pre-construction furthering the 369 Hawthorne

13 Road project while the petition is pending and after judgment pending compliance
14 with the peremptory writ;
15

16 3. For petitioners' reasonable costs, expenses, and attorney fees pursuant to

17 Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5; and

18 4. For other and further relief as the Court finds proper.
