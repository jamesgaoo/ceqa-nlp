Petitioners Make UC A Good Neighbor and The People's Park Historic District Advocacy Group
2 allege:

3 On or about July 22, 2021, Respondent Regents of the University of California certified a Final
4 Environmental Impact Report (EIR) prepared for the 2021 Long Range Development Plan for the UC

5 Berkeley campus (LRDP), Housing Project # 1, and Housing Project # 2. On or about July 22, 2021,

6 Respondent Regents of the University of California approved the LRDP and Housing Project # 1. On or

7 about September 30, 2021, Respondent Regents of the University of California approved Housing

8 Project # 2. The LRDP, Housing Project # and Housing Project # 2 are collectively referred to herein

9 as the "Project."

10 This action challenges Respondents' approval of the Project on grounds the Project approvals
violate the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).
11 3 Education Code section 67504 provides that "The Legislature further finds and declares that the
12 expansion of campus enrollment and facilities may negatively affect the surrounding environment.
13 Consistent with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), it is the intent of
14 the Legislature that the University of California sufficiently mitigate significant off-campus impacts
15 related to campus growth and development."
16 4. Public Resources Code section 21080.09, subdivision (b) requires that "Environmental effects
17 relating to changes in enrollment levels shall be considered for each campus or medical center of public
18 higher education in the environmental impact report prepared for the long range development plan for

19 the campus or medical center." Public Resources Code section 21080.09, subdivision (d) requires that 20 Respondents and the University of California, Berkeley "consider the environmental impact of academic

21 and enrollment plans" pursuant to CEQA and "that any such plans shall become effective for campus

22 only after the environmental effects of those plans have been analyzed" as required by CEQA.

19 Said Notice of Commencement of Action and Proof of Service are attached hereto as Exhibit 1; and

20 Petitioners served Respondents with written notice of commencement of this Amended and

17. Venue is proper in Alameda County pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 393(b) because
2 the Project's environmental impacts will occur in Alameda County and Code of Civil Procedure section
3 394, subdivision (a), because the University of California, Berkeley, and Respondents are situated

4 therein.

Standing
18. Petitioners and, to the extent applicable, their founders, directors, supporters, patrons,
contributors, advisors, and members are beneficially interested in Respondents' full compliance with
CEQA. Respondents owed a mandatory duty to comply with CEQA with respect to the Project and the
increase in student enrollment projected in the Project EIR. Petitioners have the right to enforce the

10 mandatory duties that CEQA imposes on Respondents.
Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies
11 19.
12 Respondents' approval of the Project is final and not subject to further administrative appeal
procedures.
13 20. In accord with Public Resources Code section 21177, subdivision (b), Petitioners objected to
14 Respondents' approval of the Project orally or in writing during the public comment period or prior to
15 the close of the public hearing on the Project before the filing of any Project-related Notice of
16 Determination.
17 21. In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21177, subdivision (a), all alleged grounds for
18 non-compliance with CEQA that are alleged herein were presented to Respondents during the public
19| comment period for, or prior to the close of the public hearing on, the Project.

20 22. In the alternative, pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21177, subdivision (e), there was

21 no opportunity for members of the public to raise the grounds of noncompliance alleged in this Petition

22 prior to Respondents' approval of the Project.

23 Private Attorney General Doctrine

24 23. Petitioners bring this action as private attorneys general pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

25 section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights affecting the public
interest.
26 24.
27 Issuance of the relief requested herein will confer a significant benefit on a large class of persons
by ensuring that Respondents complete adequate environmental review of the Project's environmental
28 effects.

1 25. Issuance of the relief requested herein will result in the enforcement of important rights affecting
2 the public interest. By compelling Respondents to complete adequate environmental review or
3 mitigation of the Project's environmental effects, Petitioners will vindicate the public's important CEQA

4 rights to public disclosure regarding and public participation in government decisions that affect the

5 environment.

6 26. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make an award of attorney's

7 fees appropriate in this proceeding because the transgressor is the agency whose duty it is to enforce the

8 laws at issue in this proceeding.
First Cause of Action
9 (Violation of CEQA: Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)
10 27. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate the preceding paragraphs of this Petition and
11 Complaint as though set forth herein in full.
12 28. The paragraphs below refer to and rely on information in documents relating to this action, all of
13 which will be filed with this Court as part of the record of proceedings and which are incorporated by
14 reference.
15 29. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in violation of CEQA pursuant to Public
16 Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5 and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5.
17 30. Respondents violated CEQA because, without limitation, Respondents:

31. These violations of CEQA include, without limitation, the legal errors described in comment

13 32. The EIR fails to lawfully assess the Project's environmental effects caused by increases in
14 enrollment and local populations at the UC Berkeley campus.
15 a. The EIR fails to include accommodating enrollment and local population increases in its
16 statement of objectives.

17 b. The EIR fails to include enrollment and campus population increases in its project

18 description, it and it fails to acknowledge Respondents' discretion with regard to enroliment and

19 local population.

20 C. The EIR fails to consider mitigation and alternatives that would reduce significant

21 impacts by reducing, delaying, or capping enrollment and local population increases.

22 d. The EIR fails to adequately or accurately account for enrollment and local population

23 increases.

e.
24 The EIR fails to adequately acknowledge and evaluate impacts due to enrollment and

25 local population increases, including, e.g., impacts related to population and housing, public
services, public services infrastructure, noise, aesthetics, solid waste, street trash, air quality,
26 vehicle miles traveled, transportation, greenhouse gases, historic and cultural resources, and
27 wildfire.
28 G The EIR fails to adequately acknowledge and evaluate impacts due to enrollment and

local population increases that may exceed the projections in the EIR, despite Respondents'
2 historical underestimation of such increases.

3 g, The EIR fails to adequately assess the cumulative impacts of past enrollment and local

4 population increases.

5 h. The EIR fails to lawfully describe the Project. For example, the EIR fails to describe the

6 whole of the Project; fails to include increases in enrollment and local population in the project
description; and fails to include accommodation of those increases in its statement of project
objectives. The EIR's "Project Study Area," identified as the project site, improperly truncates
9 the geographic scope of the project area and analysis. The EIR fails to provide adequate

10 information about the Project to support analysis of its impacts. The EIR improperly includes
mitigation measures in the project description. 11 33. The EIR fails to lawfully describe the environmental setting. For example, the EIR fails to 12 provide or justify omission of a setting description based on existing conditions, and it fails to
13 adequately describe the affected environmental setting outside the "EIR Study Area."
14 34. The EIR fails to lawfully analyze environmental effects. For example, the EIR unlawfully relies
15 on the programmatic nature of the EIR to excuse its lack of necessary information and its failure to
16 propose mitigation at a time in which Respondents still have flexibility to devise program-level
17 mitigation and consider broad policy alternatives. The EIR fails to adequately evaluate impacts deemed
18 to be significant and unavoidable. The EIR fails to adequately evaluate effects outside of the "EIR Study
19 Area."

20 35. The EIR's analysis of alternatives omits essential information, including an analysis of a range of

21 reasonable alternatives. For example, the EIR fails to consider alternatives that would reduce, cap, or

22 delay enrollment and local population increases; alternative sites, including sites outside the truncated

23 "EIR Study Area;" alternatives that would build more and denser housing on the proposed sites;

24 alternatives that would preserve or partially preserve historic and cultural resources; and alternatives that

25 would avoid or reduce multiple significant impacts. The EIR fails to provide adequate information
about and comparison of alternatives. 26 36.
27 The EIR fails to propose and evaluate adequate mitigation for significant impacts, including, e.g.,
impacts related to population and housing, public services, public services infrastructure, public utilities,
28 transportation, air quality, greenhouse gases, energy, noise, vehicle miles traveled, and wildfire. For

17-5808 First Amended and Supplemental Petition for Writ of Mandate; Case No. RG21110142 (CEQA)

H example, the EIR fails to propose mitigation that would reduce, cap, or delay enrollment and local
2 population increases. The EIR improperly defers the formulation of mitigation, relies on vague or
3 unenforceable "Continuing Best Practices," and fails to identify performance standards. The EIR fails to
4 propose adequate mitigation for impacts it finds significant and unavoidable. The EIR fails to evaluate

5 the significance of impacts with and without the mitigation included in the project description, and it

6 fails to consider alternatives to that mitigation.

7 37. The EIR fails to lawfully assess the Project's effects on historic and cultural resources. For

8 example, the EIR fails to adequately describe existing conditions at the project site, including the

9 historically significant character of the area surrounding the project site; the EIR provides an incomplete

10 analysis of impacts to identified historic resources; the EIR improperly defers mitigation of significant

11 impacts to identified historic resources; the EIR fails to adequately analyze or mitigate impacts relating
to archacological resources; the EIR fails to analyze alternative building designs and locations that avoid
12 significant impacts on historic and cultural resources; the EIR fails to consider feasible mitigation to
13 avoid or reduce impacts to historic and cultural resources; and the EIR proposes ineffective mitigation
14 for impacts to historic and cultural resources.
15 38. The EIR fails to lawfully assess or mitigate the Project's effects on air quality.
16 39. The EIR fails to lawfully assess or mitigate the Project's effects on traffic, transportation, and
17 vehicle miles travelled.
18 40. The EIR fails to lawfully assess or mitigate the Project's effects on wildfires and wildfire risks.
19 41. The EIR fails to lawfully assess or mitigate the Project's effects on greenhouse gas emissions and

20 climate change.

21 42. The EIR fails to lawfully assess or mitigate the Project's effects on noise pollution.

22 43. The EIR fails to lawfully assess or mitigate the Project's land use effects and inconsistencies with

23 the City's General Plan and zoning laws and with other applicable regional plans.
44.
24 The EIR fails to lawfully assess or mitigate the Project's effects on population and housing,

25 including effects related to induced growth and housing displacement.
45.
26 The EIR fails to lawfully assess or mitigate the Project's cumulative effects.
46. The EIR fails to lawfully assess or mitigate the Project's effects on public services, utilities,
27 public service and utilities infrastructure, schools, and public safety.
28 47. The EIR fails to lawfully assess or mitigate the Project's effects on energy.

49. The EIR fails to lawfully assess or mitigate the Project's effects on biological resources.
50. The EIR fails to lawfully assess or mitigate the Project's effects on parks and recreation.

8 will suffer irreparable injury unless this Court issues the relief requested herein.

10 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for the following relief:

Re: Notice of Intent to Sue Regarding Inadequate CEQA Review of UC
Berkeley's Housing Project #2 identified in the Environmental Impact Report prepared for the campus's 2021 Long Range Development Plan and Housing Projects #1 and #2 certified by the Regents in July 2021.
Dear Chancellor Christ and Regents of the University of California and Mr. Robinson:
This office represents Make UC A Good Neighbor and The People's Park Historic District Advocacy Group (Petitioners) with respect to the University of California, Berkeley's legal obligation to conduct environmental review of UC Berkeley's 2021 Long Range Development Plan, Housing Project #1, and Housing Project #2 in compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

As you know, Petitioners have already filed a lawsuit challenging the Regents approval of UC Berkeley's 2021 Long Range Development Plan and Housing Project #1 on grounds that the approval violates CEQA. That action is entitled Make UC a Good Neighbor, et al. v. The Regents of the University of California, Alameda Superior Court, Case No. RG21110142.
This letter provides notice pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5 that Petitioners also intend to file a legal action to challenge the Regents' September 30, 2021,

Chancellor Carol T. Christ, University of California, Berkeley Regents of the University of California
Charles Robinson
Notice of Intent to Sue Regarding Housing Project #2. October 12, 2021
Page 2
approval of Housing Project #2 on grounds that the approval violates CEQA.
Petitioners are interested in discussing settlement of this dispute without the need for litigation. Given the short, 30-day statute of limitations that presumably applies here, however, Petitioners will file the action forthwith.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Very Truly Yours,
Tom Lfjpe
Thomas N. Lippe
