VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

Petitioner and Plaintiff WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION ("WSPA")
2  hereby files this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandamus and Complaint for Declaratory Relief and
3 alleges as follows:

4 INTRODUCTION

5 1. Oil and gas production in Ventura County have anchored the local economy for more

6 than 100 years. The industry supports more than 2,000 good-paying jobs for working families and
7 generates millions of dollars in tax revenue.

8 2. Local oil and gas also provide major degree of energy security to the state and
9 reduces California's reliance on imported oil from foreign countries.

10 3. As the nation grapples with the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States

11 Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has identified workers in the oil and gas industry

12 as "critical infrastructure workers," whose work is imperative during the nation's response to the
13 pandemic for both public health, security, and community well-being.

14 4. But the County has turned a blind eye to the many contributions the oil and gas
15 industry has made to the local economy and its diverse workforce.

16 5. Recently, on September 15, 2020, the County Board of Supervisors certified an
17 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act
18 ("CEQA") for the Ventura County 2040 General Plan Update ("GPU") and approved the GPU. The
19 EIR concluded that the GPU will have significant and unavoidable impacts on the environment,

20  including impacts to petroleum resources.

21 6. The EIR for the GPU ran afoul of CEQA in almost every way imaginable. It
a 22 contained a legally inadequate description of the environmental setting, incorporated infeasible
23 mitigation measures, failed to adequately analyze cumulative impacts, and improperly piecemealed
24  its analysis of the GPU.

25 7. In addition, the GPU contained a series of Oil and Gas Policies that will phase out
26 the production of oil and gas in the County through the imposition of unduly restrictive and unlawful
27  policies. Still, the County did not stop there.

28 8. On November 10, 2020, the County adopted amendments to the County's Coastal

1
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 Zoning Ordinance ("CZO") and Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance ("NCZO") (collectively, "Zoning
2 Amendments") and determined that the Zoning Amendments are exempt from CEQA. Accordingly,
3 the County failed to analyze the potentially significant impacts the Zoning Amendments will have

4 on the environment in compliance with CEQA. The County refused to conduct any CEQA analysis

5 even though the Zoning Amendments broaden the applicability of the GPU's Oil and Gas Policies,
6 which the County has already found will have significant and unavoidable impacts on the
7 environment.

8 9. The Zoning Amendments in conjunction with the GPU will effectively shut down oil
9 and gas production in Ventura County. Without the millions of dollars in tax revenue that the oil

10 and gas industry provides to the County each year, the County would be forced to cut spending for
11 numerous County programs and services such as law enforcement, fire prevention, social programs,
12 and public health services in the midst of a global pandemic that has taken tens of thousands of lives

13 and dealt an enormous blow to the state and local economy. This precipitous attack on the oil and
14 gas industry is short-sighted and will significantly increase carbon emissions, while failing to
15 provide any public health benefits to County residents and businesses.

16 10. The County cannot proceed to implement the Zoning Amendments without first
17 analyzing and feasibly mitigating their significant environmental effects in compliance with CEQA.

18 11. Accordingly, WSPA brings this action to challenge the decisions of Respondents and
19 Defendants COUNTY OF VENTURA and VENTURA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS

20 to adopt the Zoning Amendments without conducting any analysis under CEQA.

21 PARTIES

22 12. Petitioner WSPA is a California non-profit corporation and longstanding trade
23 association of cnergy companies that explore for, produce, refine, transport and market petroleum,
24 | petroleum products, natural gas, and other energy supplies in California and four other western
25 states, including several oil and gas producers in the County of Ventura. WSPA is dedicated to
26 ensuring that Americans continue to have reliable access to petroleum products through policies that
27 are socially, economically, and environmentally responsible. WSPA's principal offices are located

28 at L 1415 L Street, Suite 900, Sacramento, California, 95814.

2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

13. Respondent COUNTY OF VENTURA, a political subdivision of the State of

2 California, is responsible for regulating and controlling land use in its territory, including

3 implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA.

4 14. Respondent VENTURA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS is the elected
5 decision-making body of the County.

6 15. WSPA does not know the true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate,
7 associate, or otherwise, of Defendants and Respondents DOES through 20, inclusive, and therefore

8 sue said parties under fictitious names. WSPA will amend this Petition and Complaint to show their

9 true names and capacities when the same have been ascertained.

10 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

11 16. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to California Code of Civil
12 Procedure sections 1085 (alternatively section 1094.5) and 526; and Public Resources Code sections
13 21168.5 (alternatively section 21168) and 21167.

14 17. Venue is proper in Ventura County Superior Court pursuant to Code of Civil
15 Procedure sections 393(b), 394(a) and 395 because Respondents in this action are the County of
16 Ventura and its Board of Supervisors, a local agency, and all the acts and omission occurred in
17 Ventura County.

18 18. WSPA has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by prior service of

19 a notice upon the County indicating its intent to file this Petition. Proof of Service of this
20 notification, with the notification, is attached as Exhibit A.

21 19. WSPA has elected to prepare the record of proceedings in the above-captioned
22 | proceeding or to pursue an alternative method of record preparation pursuant to Public Resources

23 Code Section 21167.6(b)(2). Notification of the Election to Prepare the Administrative Record is
24 attached as Exhibit B.

25 20. WSPA has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
26 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by mailing a copy of this Petition to the California
27 Attorney General on December 17, 2020. A copy of the letter transmitting the Petition to the
28 Attorney General is attached as Exhibit C.

3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 21. WSPA has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant action

2 and has exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

3 22. This Petition is timely filed within 35-days after Respondents filed the Notice of
4 Exemptions ("NOE") with the County Clerk on November 13, 2020. A copy of the NOE for the
5 NCZO and CZO are attached hereto as Exhibit D and Exhibit E, respectively.

6 23. WSPA has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the court of ordinary law because

7 WSPA and its members will be irreparably harmed by the ensuing damage caused by
8 implementation of the Zoning Amendments and Respondents' violations of CEQA, as well as other
9 I aspects of state law. In the absence of such remedies, the County's approval will remain in effect in
10 violation of state law.

11 STANDING

12 24. WSPA has associational standing to bring this suit on behalf of its members because

13 more than one of those members will be directly, adversely, and imminently affected by the County's

14 adoption of the Zoning Amendments and failure to analyze the Zoning Amendments in conformance

15 with CEQA, and thus would have standing to sue in their in own right.' If the approvals for the Zoning
16 Amendments are not rescinded and subject to CEQA review, WSPA will face immediate and

17 threatened injury. Furthermore, the interests that WSPA seeks to protect by way of this lawsuit are

18 germane to the organization's purpose. Specifically, WSPA is dedicated to addressing the wide

19 range of public policy issues that affect the petroleum industry, including zoning codes that impose
20  unreasonable and unlawful mandates on WSPA members. Finally, neither the claims asserted, nor

21 the relief requested requires an individual member of WSPA to participate in this suit.

22 25. WSPA has an interest in this action because its members own and operate petroleum
23 refineries in Ventura County, which are subject to the Zoning Amendments. WSPA's members have
24 been or will be impacted by the Zoning Amendments.

25 LEGAL BACKGROUND - CEQA

26 26. Enacted in 1970, CEQA imposes a statewide policy of environmental protection.
27 CEQA'S basic purposes include: informing government decisionmakers and the public about the

28 A list of WSPA's member companies is available at: https://www.wspa.org/about/.

potential, significant environmental effects of proposed activities; identifying ways that
2 environmental damage can be avoided or significantly reduced; and preventing significant,
3 avoidable damage to the environment by requiring changes in projects through the use of alternatives

4 or mitigation measures when the governmental agency finds the changes to be feasible. (Tomlinson

5 V. County of Alameda (2012) 54 Cal.4th 281, 285-286; Guidelines ยง 15002(a).)2

6 27. CEQA applies whenever a government agency approves a discretionary project,
7 defined as "an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a
8 reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment." (Pub. Res. Code ยง 21065.)
9 The California Supreme Court has stated that applicability of CEQA must "be interpreted in such

10 manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of

11 the statutory language." (Friends of Mammoth v. Bd. of Supervisors (1972) 8 Cal.3d 247, 259.)

12 28. Prior to the approval of a project, CEQA requires the lead agency to prepare an
13 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") if the agency "finds substantial evidence that the project may
a 14 have a significant effect on the environment." (Pub. Res. Code ยง 21165; Guidelines ยงยง 15002(f)(1)

15 & 15064(a)(1).) An EIR is a public document that is "used by the governmental agency to analyze
16 the significant environmental effects of a proposed project, to identify alternatives, and to disclose
17 possible ways to reduce or avoid the possible environmental damage." (Guidelines ยง 15002(f).)

18 Whether a project may have significant effect on the environment "calls for careful judgment on
19 the part of the public agency involved, based to the extent possible on scientific and factual data."
20 (Guidelines ยง 15064(b).)

21 29. CEQA does not apply if a project fits within an exemption. There are two types of
22 exemptions under CEQA: statutory and categorical.

23 30. Statutory exemptions are projects specifically excluded from CEQA consideration as
24 defined by the State Legislature.

25 31. Categorical exemptions are classes of projects identified by the State Natural
26| Resources Agency that are generally considered not to have potential environmental impacts.

27
28 2 "Guidelines" refers to the CEQA Guidelines embodied in Title 14, Chapter 3 of the California Code of Regulations, including 14 C.C.R. ยงยง 15000 - 15387 and Appendices A through N.

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

(Guidelines ยงยง 15300 - 15331.) For example, one type of CEQA exemption - and the type at issue
2 in this litigation is the Class 8 Categorical exemption, which exempts "actions taken by regulatory

3 agencies, as authorized by state or local ordinance, to assure the maintenance, restoration, or

4 protection of the environment where the regulatory process involves procedures for protection of the
environment." (Guidelines ยง 15308.)

6 32. Even if an agency determines that a project is categorically exempt from CEQA, the
7 agency must still determine whether any of the exceptions in CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2

8 apply. The agency must determine whether the exceptions in section 15300.2 apply, regardless of
9 whether a fair argument has been made. (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com. (1997)
10 16 Cal.4th 105, 124.)

11 33. Because CEQA exemptions do not require extensive fact-finding and environmental
12 analysis, they have narrow applicability. (Santa Monica Chamber of Commerce v. City of Santa
13 Monica (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 786, 793.) The lead agency bears the burden to demonstrate with

14 substantial evidence that its project will fit within an exemption. (California Unions for Reliable
15 Energy v. Mojave Desert Air Quality Management Dist. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1239.) If
16 there is a fair argument a that a project may have a significant a effect on the environment, a CEQA

17 exemption cannot apply. (Banker's Hill, Hillcrest, Park West Community Preservation Group v.
18 City of San Diego (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 249, 266.)

19 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

20 Oil and Gas Operations in Ventura County

21 34. Oil and gas exploration began in Ventura County during the mid-1800's and
22 established itself as one of the primary economic drivers bchind the County's growth from the early

23 1900's onward to today. With the County's first zoning ordinance in 1947, oil and gas exploration
24 and production projects were identified as a "special use" requiring discretionary approval that could
25 only be authorized by the Board of Supervisors following the consideration and advisory
26 recommendation of the Planning Commission.

27 35. Of the nearly 800 special use or conditional use permits (CUPs) issued by the County

28 for oil and gas exploration and production operations since 1947, approximately 120 are still active

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

today.

2 36. The first discretionary special use permits3 issued for oil and gas operations typically

3 authorized the continuation or expansion of operations which existed before the County adopted its

4 first zoning ordinance and imposed a permit requirement in 1947. Approximately 60 percent of the

5 wells in Ventura County are operated under permits that were first issued between 1948 and the end

6 of 1950.

7 37. Oil and gas CUPs granted by the County prior to 1966 generally authorized operators
8 to use specifically-described parcels of land for "drilling for and extraction of oil, gas and other
9 hydrocarbon substances and installing, and using, buildings, equipment and other appurtenances
10 accessory thereto...." Unless subsequently modified, these permits did not contain expiration dates

11 or specifically identify the location or number of wells that could be drilled under the permit. Thus,
12 once vested, these permits authorize the continued drilling of new wells and installation of accessory

13 facilities, and cannot be unilaterally modified or cancelled without a showing of nuisance. These
14 long-term permits are oftentimes referred to by the County as "antiquated permits." Approximately

15 80 of the CUPs issued prior to 1966 that do not include expiration dates remain active today.

16 38. CUPs from the 1960's onward typically authorize the drilling and operation of a

17 certain number of drill sites, well and/or other structures, require discretionary County approval for
18 subsequent development, and contain expiration dates. Approximately 40 of the CUPs issued for

19 oil and gas operations from 1966 to the present are currently active.

20 Approval of New Oil and Gas Development

21 39. Under the County's zoning ordinances, new oil and gas development projects must
22 be authorized by a discretionary CUP. (NCZO ยงยง 8105-4 and 8105-5; CZO ยง 8174-5.) Changes to
23 development authorized under an existing, modern-era oil and gas CUP also requires County
24 discretionary approval in the form of a permit adjustment or modification. (NCZO ยง 8111-6.1; CZO

25 8181-10.4.)

26 40. The County's zoning ordinances direct the Planning Division to evaluate

27

28 Special use permits are the predecessors to the County's CUPs and are sometimes hereinafter
referred to as CUPs.

7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

I discretionary oil and gas proposals for their consistency with the oil development operational
2 standards set forth in NCZO section 8107-5.6 and CZO section 8175-5.7.8. Similarly, the County's
zoning ordinances direct the Planning Division to develop and impose conditions of approval on a

4 project based on the oil development design guidelines set forth in NCZO section 8107-5.5 and CZO
5 section 8175-5.7.7.

6 41. Prior to the Zoning Amendments, new oil and gas development proposed under long-
7 term permits was permissible after approval through a ministerial zoning clearance.

8 42. The primary standards for determining if a zoning clearance is to be issued in relation
to a proposed oil and gas development are whether the proposed development is consistent with and
10 authorized by an underlying, active discretionary permit, and whether the proposed development

11 complies with the County's applicable zoning ordinance and General Plan provisions. (NCZO

12 von 8111-1.1.1b; CZO ยง 8181-3.1a.)

13 Background on the Zoning Amendments

14 43. The County's recent adoption of the Zoning Amendments began with allegations of
15 a potential threat to groundwater in the Fox Canyon area purportedly caused by oil and gas
16 exploration and production operations. According to the County Resource Management Agency,

17 on February 25, 2019, the United States Geologic Survey (USGS) reported that it had allegedly

18 found indications that petroleum-related gases were migrating into the Fox Canyon aquifer system

19 in the vicinity of existing oil wells utilizing cyclic steam injection.

20 44. Accordingly, the Resource Management Agency recommended that the Board of

21 Supervisors direct the Planning Division to return to the Board with a proposed interim ordinance

22 pursuant to Government Code section 65858 to temporarily prohibit the County's approval of new
23 oil and gas wells, and re-drilling of existing oil and gas wells, for oil production that will utilize

24 steam injection in the vicinity of potable groundwater aquifers while the County studies potential
25 regulations for this land use. The Resource Management Agency further recommended that the
26 Board of Supervisors direct the Planning Division to also study potential amendments to the
27 County's zoning ordinances to require discretionary approval of new development under long-term
28 oil and gas permits. These recommendations were placed on the Board of Supervisors' agenda as

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

-

2 Agenda Item 46 for the Board's April 9, 2019 regular public meeting.

45.

3 At the conclusion of the April 9, 2019 regular public meeting, the Board approved
both recommendations.

4 46.

5 On April 23, June 4, and November 5, 2019, the Board approved and then extended

6 the proposed interim urgency ordinance prohibiting County approval of new oil wells, and the re-

7 drilling of existing wells, that would utilize steam injection on a portion of the Oxnard Plan overlying

8 the Fox Canyon aquifer that was the subject of the USGS study. The interim urgency ordinance was

9 intended to remain in effect until December 7, 2020, unless terminated sooner by the Board.

47. The Board took these actions even though the purported concerns regarding
10 allegations of a potential threat to groundwater in the Fox Canyoner area were conclusively proven

11 false by the County itself. In a Technical Memorandum, dated May 16, 2019, and revised October
12 29, 2019, Dan Tormey, of Catalyst Environmental Solutions, the County's expert consultant for oil
13 and gas issues, stated that the USGS groundwater monitoring results "do not indicate that oil and
14 gas operations have impacted groundwater quality." And, furthermore, Catalyst "did not identify
15 ongoing threats to the groundwater quality" from oil and gas activities.

16 48. Nevertheless, in response to the Board's direction to study potential amendments to
17 the County's zoning ordinances to require discretionary approval of new development under long-
18 term oil and gas permits, County Counsel, in consultation with the Planning Division, provided the
19 Board with a written report that was the subject of Item 3 of the Board's September 10, 2019 regular
20 public meeting.

21 The report states, among other things, that the County can legally require

22 discretionary approval and environmental review of proposed new oil and gas production facilities
on land covered by long-term permits, and that the County can, in general, apply its oil development
23 standards to all existing oil and gas production facilities.*

24

25 Notably, County Counsel reached these erroneous legal conclusions even though the County itseif

26 had previously recognized that its "ability to impose new conditions on antiquated permits is very limited. Because of the vested rights doctrine and constitutional protections afforded to these

27 permits, the County can impose new, narrowly tailored conditions on these permits only when a compelling public necessity, such as danger, harm or public nuisance, or significant violations exist, and not through an ordinary exercise of the police power for the general welfare." (County Counsel's Office Memorandum regarding Legal Analysis of Antiquated Oilfield Conditional Use Permits, 28| emphasis added.) The County also previously recognized that a "when a conditional use permit has

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

49. A potential draft amendment to the NCZO that would purportedly accomplish these

2 objectives was attached to the September 10, 2019 staff report. At the conclusion of the September

3 10, 2019 item, the Board directed "the Planning Division to prepare draft amendments to the

4 County's zoning ordinances that are consistent with the potential draft amendment attached to the
5 County Counsel report to be processed through the standard land use public hearing process."

6 Planning Commission Considers the Zoning Amendments

7 50. On July 30, 2020, the County Planning Commission considered the Zoning

8 Amendments at a public hearing. The purpose of the hearing was to determine whether the Planning

9 Commission should recommend that the Board: (1) adopt, not adopt, or adopt with modification the
10 Zoning Amendments; (2) find that the Zoning Amendments are exempt from CEQA; and (3) find

11 that the Zoning Amendments are consistent with the goals, policies, and programs of the Ventura
12 County General Plan, the Ventura County Coastal Area Plan, and the Coastal Act.

13 51. The Zoning Amendments, as proposed, consisted of three substantive changes to the

14 NCZO and CZO. First, the proposed Zoning Amendments would amend NCZO section 8107-5.2
15 and CZO section 8175-5.7.2, to require the issuance of a new discretionary CUP, or approval of a
16 discretionary permit adjustment or modification, to authorize all new oil and gas development,
17 including that proposed under long-term permits, unless the proposed development is already

18 specifically described as being authorized under an existing CUP. New development triggering the
19 need for discretionary approval includes, but is not limited to, the installation of new wells, tanks
20 and other oil field facilities, and the re-drilling or depending of existing wells. Because these

21 approvals would require a discretionary permit the County would subject the projects to
22 environmental review under CEQA.

23 52. Second, the proposed Zoning Amendments would amend NCZO 8107-5.2 and CZO
24 8175-5.7.2, to state that the County's current oil development design guidelines and operational
25 standards uniformly apply to all oil and gas exploration and production operations to the extent: (I)
26 such guidelines and standards would impose more stringent requirements than those set forth in

27 been issued and relied upon by the permittee, giving rise to a vested right, the permit becomes
28 immunized from impairment and revocation by subsequent government action.3 (Id., emphasis added.)

10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 existing permit conditions, laws, or regulations applicable to the operation; and (2) application of
2 such guidelines and standards would not impair any vested right of an operator under California law.

3 53. Third, the proposed Zoning Amendments would amend NCZO section 8107-5.4 and
4 CZO section 8175-5.7.5, to state that improvements that are the subject of a zoning clearance must

5 be developed within 180 days of permit issuance.

6 54. A Planning Commission Staff Report drafted by County Counsel in advance of the
7 July 30 Planning Commission hearing determined that the NCZO amendment was exempt from
8 CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15308 (the Class 8 Exemption) as an action taken by

9 regulatory agency, as authorized by state or local ordinance, "to assure the maintenance,
10 restoration, enhancement, or protection of the environment where the regulatory process involves
11 | procedures for protection of the environment."5 The Planning Division staff further determined that

12 no "unusual circumstances" or other exceptions set forth in CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2
13 prelude use of this categorical exemption.6

14 55. In addition, Planning Commission Staff Report stated that the CZO amendment was

15 exempt from CEQA pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21080.9, which exempts local
16 governments from preparing an EIR or other CEQA document in connection with an amendment to

17 a Local Coastal Program ("LCP").7 Instead, the LCP amendment must be certified by the California

18 Coastal Commission and is subject to Coastal Commission review for compliance with the Coastal

19 Act of 1972.

20 56. After the hearing on the Zoning Amendments, the Planning Commission voted 4-1
21 (Commissioner McPhail dissenting) to recommend that the Board of Supervisors (1) adopt the

22 Zoning Amendments as proposed; (2) find that the Zoning Amendments are exempt from CEQA
23 under CEQA Guidelines section 15308 and no unusual circumstances or any other exception set
24 forth in CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2 applies; and (3) find that the Zoning Amendments are
25 consistent with the goals, policies, and programs of the Ventura County General Plan, the Ventura

1 County Coastal Area Plan, and the Coastal Act.

2 57. Although the Planning Commission Staff Report indicated that the CZO was exempt

3 from CEQA under Public Resource Code section 21080.9, the actual Staff Report did not specifically
4 recommend that the Board find that the CZO amendments were exempt on that basis.8

5 County Adopts 2040 General Plan Update and Certifies EIR

6 58. Prior to considering the Planning Commission's recommendation to adopt the Zoning

7 Amendments and determine that they are exempt from CEQA, on September 15, 2020, the Board of

8 Supervisors certified an EIR for the Ventura County 2040 General Plan Update ("GPU") and

9 adopted the GPU. There were over 400 new goals, policies, and programs that were added to the
10 GPU, including the adoption of several Oil and Gas Policies.

11 59. The EIR determined that the GPU would have significant and unavoidable impacts

12 on the environment, including impacts to petroleum resources.

13 60. The EIR was riddled with flaws, including legally inadequate description of the
14 environmental setting, incorporation of infeasible mitigation measures, a flawed analysis of
15 cumulative impacts, improper piecemealing, and unlawful Oil and Gas policies that would impair
16 vested rights.

17 61. While the GPU's policies purport to "effectively and safely manage the exploration,
18 production, and drilling of oil and gas resources in Ventura County," they actually present an all-out
19 | assault on the oil and gas industry. The GPU will effectively phase out the production of oil and gas

20 in the County through the imposition of unduly restriction and unlawful policies.

21 62. The EIR did not consider or analyze proposed amendments to the CZO and NCZO,

22 which will deliver an additional blow to the public and the environment, as discussed further herein.

23 Board of Supervisors Hearing on Zoning Amendments

24 63. On November 10, 2020, the Board of Supervisors held a public meeting to consider
25 adopting the Planning Commission's recommendations on the Zoning Amendments.

26 64. An agenda for the Board of Supervisors' meeting was posted on the County's website

27 In advance of the meeting. The proposed actions regarding the Zoning Amendments appeared as

28 8 Id. at pp. 15-16.

12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

Agenda Item 47 on the Board's Agenda.

2 65. Agenda Item 47 contained several supporting materials, including a "Board Letter"
3 from the County Resource Management Agency, which contained certain recommended actions,
including that the Board: (1) find that the NCZO is exempt from CEQA under CEQA Guidelines

5 section 15308 and no unusual circumstances or any other exception set forth in CEQA Guidelines

6 section 15300.2 applies; (2) find that the CZO is exempt from CEQA pursuant to Public Resources

7 Code section 21080.9 as an amendment to the County's LCP; (3) find that the Zoning Amendments

8 are consistent with the goals, policies, and programs of the Ventura County General Plan, the
9 Ventura County Coastal Area Plan, and the Coastal Act; (4) adopt the NCZO amendments; and (5)
10 adopt the CZO amendments subject to Coastal Commission certification.

11 66. No in-person participation was available for the November 10 meeting. Instead, the
12 agenda for the meeting stated that the building was closed to the public, and further noted that
13 participants should attend online. The agenda further stated that in order to comment during the
14 meeting via Zoom, a participant was required to register. Comments made while watching the
15 livestream are only read at the "discretion of the chair."

16 67. In addition, while the County provided instructions as to how the public could
17 electronically attend hearings and provide public comment, in practice it was a confusing and
18 complicated process since each participation method has a separate registration process, deadline,
19 and requirements. Not all Ventura County community members have equal access to the technology

20 required to participate in virtual hearings. Indeed, approximately 8,000 residents in Ventura County

21 do not have access to any wired Internet.' Thus, thousands of Ventura County residents were unable

22 to attend and/or comment on the proposed actions in advance of and during the November 10 Board

23 meeting.

24 68. Planning Director Dave Ward presented the proposed Zoning Amendments to the
25 Board of Supervisors during the November 10 Board meeting. At the beginning of his presentation,
26 the following discussion occurred between Mr. Ward, Chair Kelly Long, and the Clerk:

Dave Ward: And ] think the clerk also has an item that updates one of your

2 recommendations in your board letter, which is recommendation number two, which

3 relates to the findings being requested to be made today in regards to CEQA.

4 Kelly Long: And is this new [sic] available to the public?
5 Clerk: Not yet.

6 Kelly Long: Okay.

7 Clerk: We are just receiving it.

8 Kelly Long: Is it in your PowerPoint presentation?
9 Dave Ward: Yeah, I will be covering it.

10 69. The updated item to the Board Letter referenced by Mr. Ward was a recommendation

11 that the Board of Supervisors find "to the extent commenters have raised issues about the application
12 of new 2040 General Plan policies to new oil and gas wells, that those impacts factually are the same

13 as the impacts evaluated in the certified environmental impact report (EIR) for the 2040 General
14 Plan, that there is no new or substantially more severe impact requiring a further EIR under CEQA
15| Guidelines section 15162, and that it is appropriate to rely on that certified EIR for the extension of
16 those policies to new oil and gas wells, and reliance on that EIR is an independent basis under CEQA

17 for the adoption of the proposed zoning ordinance amendments."Io Notably, a summary of this

18 updated recommendation was not included in the Agenda posted on the County's website in advance
19  of the November 10 Board meeting. The Agenda did not cite or refer to the EIR for the GPU or
20 CEQA Guidelines section 15162. In addition, as the clerk had conceded, the County had not

21 circulated the revised Board Letter to the public prior to or during the November 10 meeting. The

22 revised Board Letter was subsequently uploaded to the County's website embedded in a hyperlink
23 to Agenda Item 47 after the November 10 meeting had already concluded. The County therefore
24 failed 10 notify the public of this proposed finding in advance of the November 10 meeting.

25 70. WSPA sent a cure and correct letter to the Board of Supervisors on November 23,
26 2020 explaining that these actions constituted violations of the Ralph M. Brown Act (Gov. Code ยง

54952), which was enacted to ensure that all meetings of state and local legisiative bodies are open,

2 public, and all persons can attend. A copy of WSPA's cure and correct letter is attached hereto as
3 Exhibit F. Specifically, WSPA alleged that the actions described above (1) violated the Brown

4 Act's requirement that the Board post an agenda 72 hours before a regular meeting containing a brief

5 general description of each item of business (Gov Code ยง 54954.2; San Joaquin Raptor Rescue

6 Center v. County of Merced (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 1167, 1176-1177 [commission violated Brown

7 Act by taking action a on a CEQA document that was not expressly disclosed on meeting agenda]),

8 and (2) violated the Brown Act's prohibition against requiring registration to attend a public meeting
(id. at ยง 54953.3). The County has 30-days to notify WSPA of any intent to cure and correct these
10 Brown Act violations. If the County fails to cure and correct these violations, WSPA will promptly

11 amend this Petition to state a claim for violations of the Brown Act.

12 71. Despite the numerous violations that occurred during the November 10 meeting, the
13 Board of Supervisors proceeded to vote 3 to 2 (Supervisors Hubber and Long dissenting) to approve
14 Agenda Item 47 regarding adoption of the Zoning Amendments.

15 CEQA EXEMPTIONS

16 72. The Board of Supervisors incorrectly determined that the Zoning Amendments are

17 exempt from CEQA.
18 | The NCZO Amendments are Not Exempt Under CEQA Guidelines Section 15308

19 73. The Class 8 Exemption under CEQA Guidelines section 15308 exempts "actions
20 taken by regulatory agencies, as authorized by state or local ordinance, to assure the maintenance,

21 restoration, enhancement, or protection of the environment where the regulatory process involves

22 procedures for the protection of the environment." Notably, the Class 8 exemption does not apply

23 to agency actions that improve one clement of the environment but have significant effects on
24 another. (Dunn-Edwards Corp. v. Bay Area Air Quality Management District (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th
25 644 [Class 8 exemption does not apply to new regulations designed to reduce volatile organic
26 carbons (VOCs) in paint because the regulations could also increase other VOC emissions].)

27 74. The Class 8 Exemption does not apply to the NZCO amendments for several reasons
28 including, but not limited to, the three reasons discussed below.

15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 75. First, the Board of Supervisors is legislative body, not a regulatory agency. The

2 Class Exemption only applies to "actions taken by regulatory agencies," not legislative actions by
3 | a legislative body handling broad zoning issues. (Guidelines ยง 15308.)

4 76. Second, the NCZO amendments will not maintain, enhance, or protect the
5 environment. (Save Our Big Trees v. City of Santa Cruz (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 694 [City's use of
6 Class 8 Exemption for its ordinance amendment was overturned for failure to demonstrate
7  substantial evidence that the project would assure maintenance, enhancement, or protection of the

8 environment].) Rather, substantial evidence demonstrates that the NCZO amendments will have

9 significant effects on the environment including, but not limited to, impacts to mineral resources and
10 greenhouse gas emissions.

11 A. Mineral Resources. The NCZO amendments will have a significant impact on

12 mineral resources. CEQA Appendix G states that an impact is significant if it would "result

13 in the loss of availability of a known mineral resource" or would "result in the loss of

14 availability of a locally important mineral resource recovery site delineated on a local general

15 plan, specific plan, or other land use plan." Mineral resources, which are part of the

16 environment, include petroleum resources. (See Pub. Res. Code sp 21060.5 [defining

17 "environment" to include "minerals"].) The NCZO amendments will have a significant

18 effect on the environment because they will hamper, preclude, and limit the availability of

19 known petroleum resources in the County. In fact, the Resource Management Agency's
20 Board Letter concedes that the NCZO amendments "could slow and/or reduce the potential

21 expansion of new oil and gas development.ยป11 The Board Letter further concedes that the

22 new GPU Oil and Gas Policies COS 7.2 (increasing minimum well setback distances from

23 sensitive uses), 7.7 (requiring oil and produced water to be transported offsite by pipeline),

24 and 7.8 (prohibiting flaring of produced gas) "reduce the locations where, and types of, new

25 oil production facilities that can be discretionarily permitted by the County," and that the

26 NCZO amendments "would make these new policies applicable to a broader range of

27 1 Ventura County Resource Management Agency, letter to Board of Supervisors, Nov. 10, 2020,
28 p. 8, emphasis added.

16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 proposed oil and gas development."12 Importantly, the Final EIR for the GPU already

2 concluded that the Oil and Gas Policies would have significant and unavoidable impacts on

3 the environment, including (1) the loss of availability of known petroleum resources of value

4 to the region and the State, and (2) hampering or precluding access to petroleum resources.13

5 By broadening the applicability of the GPU Oil and Gas Policies, the Zoning Amendments

6 will necessarily exacerbate the significant and unavoidable impacts the Policies will have on

7 the environment, Thus, the Final EIR for the GPU provides clear, substantial evidence that

8 the Zoning Amendments will have significant impacts on mineral resources.
9 B. Greenhouse Gas Emissions. The NCZO amendments will result in the generation

10 of greenhouse gas emissions ("GHG") that will have a significant effect on the environment.

11 Specifically, the NCZO amendments will significantly reduce oil and gas production in the

12 County, which will increase the County's demand and reliance on foreign oil, which is more is

13 carbon intensive.14 California does not have any interstate pipelines that supply crude oil to

14 the State from other states, and therefore must rely on foreign and Alaska sources of oil that

15 are transported by marine tankers. 15 Because the carbon intensity of Ventura oil is lower

16 than imported oil, higher GHG emissions will result from the import of crude oil into

17 California from outside of Ventura. 16 The Final EIR for the GPU concluded that the GPU

18 would have significant and unavoidable impacts on GHG emissions.17 The NCZO

19 amendments will exacerbate these already significant and unavoidable impacts.

20 77. Third, exceptions to the Class 8 Exemption apply. Under CEQA Guidelines section

21 15300.2, the Class 8 exemption is inapplicable to projects that result in cumulative impacts or

24 See, e.g., 2040 General Plan Update Draft EIR, p. 4.12-21 (conceding that demand for oil and gas resulting from reduced oil and gas production in the County would have to be satisfied through
25 "the importation of additional oil and gas from other countries and Alaska, which in turn could have indirect environmental impacts such as those associated with transporting the oil and gas 26 from outside of Ventura County."). ld.

17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

significant effects due to unusual circumstances.

2 A. Cumulative Impacts. The Class 8 exemption is "inapplicable when the cumulative

3 impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant."

4 (Guidelines 15300.2(b).) The exception for cumulative impacts applies because the

5 NCZO amendments in conjunction with the GPU Oil and Gas Policies will have a

6 cumulatively significant impact on the environment including, but not limited to, impacts

7 on mineral resources and greenhouse gas emissions.

8 B. Unusual Circumstances. The Class 8 exemption cannot be used "when there is a

9 reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due

10 to unusual circumstances." (Guidelines 15300.2(c).) As explained in case law, an

11 unusual circumstance refers to "some feature of the project that distinguishes it from others

12 in the exempt class." (San Lorenzo Valley Community Advocate for Responsible Educ. v.

13 San Lorenzo Unified Sch. Dist. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1381, quoting Fairbank v.

14 City of Mill Valley (1999) 75 Cal.App.4th 1243, 1260.) The NCZO Amendments present

15 "unusual circumstances" for several reasons. The NCZO amendments do not impose

16 procedures for the protection of the environment, but instead eviscerate existing permits to

17 revoke previously issued property rights. Further, they will actually encourage the

18 importation of carbon-intensive foreign oil into the state, which distinguishes the NCZO

19 amendments from other ordinances covered under the Class 8 exemption. In addition,

20 there is a reasonable possibility that significant environmental impacts will result from

21 those unusual circumstances, including impacts to greenhouse gas emissions and mineral

22 resources.

23 78. Accordingly, the County cannot claim that the NCZO amendments are exempt from
24 CEQA. Instead, the County must prepare an initial study and determine whether to draft an EIR or
25 Negative Declaration.

26 The CZO Amendments are Not Exempt Pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21080.9

27 79. CEQA exempts activities and approvals by a local government for the preparation
28 and adoption of a local coastal program ("LCP") or long-range land use development plan under the

18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

California Coastal Act. (Pub. Res. Code ยง 21080.9.) The County claims that the CZO amendments

2 are exempt pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21080.9 as an amendment to the County's

3 LCP. The California Coastal Act defines a "local coastal program" as a "local government's (a)
4 land use plans, (b) zoning ordinances, (c) zoning district maps, and (d) within sensitive coastal

5 resources areas, other implementing actions, which, when taken together, meet the requirements of,

6 and implement the provisions and policies of, this division at the local level." (Pub. Res. Code

7 30108.6.)

8 80. The exemption under Section 21080.9 does not apply because the CZO amendments
9 do not constitute amendments to an LCP. As discussed above, in order to constitute an amendment

10 to an LCP, the CZO amendments must "implement the provisions and policies of' the California

11 Coastal Act. (Pub. Res. Code ยง 30108.6.) The Coastal Acts' goals and policies are set forth in
12 Public Resources Code section 30001.5. The CZO amendments would not implement several of

13 these policies including, but not limited to, the policies discussed below.

14 81. One policy of the Coastal Act is to "assure orderly, balanced utilization and
15 conservation of coastal zone resources taking into account the social and economic needs of the
16 people of the state." (Pub. Res. Code ยง 30001.5(b), emphasis added.) The CZO amendments do not
17 assure the "balanced utilization" of the coastal zone because they will significantly hamper, limit,

18 and render infeasible the utilization of the coastal zone for oil and gas development. In addition, the

19 CZO amendments do not take "into account the social and economic needs of the people of the
20 state." To the contrary, the County concedes that the CZO amendments will "slow and/or reduce
21 the potential expansion of new local oil and gas development, which in turn could have a negative
22 economic impact on this economic sector and its employment base, due to the increased permitting
23 costs and uncertainty that would be associated with the proposed discretionary permitting and
24 environmental review process that would be required for certain new oil and gas development."18

25 82. A second policy of the Coastal Act is to "encourage state and local initiatives and
26 cooperation in preparing procedures to implement coordinated planning and development for
27 mutually beneficial uses, including educational uses, in the coastal zone." (Pub. Res. Code

28 18 Revised Board Letter, p. 8, emphasis added; see id. at p. 9.

19
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 ยง 30001.5(e).) Development of oil and gas in the coastal zone is mutually beneficial to the County
2 and industry because it generates millions of dollars in local tax revenue, reduces reliance on foreign
3 oil, and generates employment opportunities for thousands of essential workers. Thus, by
4 implementing restrictions that will hamper, reduce, and render infeasible the expansion of oil and

5 gas development in the coastal zone, the CZO amendments would discourage the planning and
6 development of oil and gas resources within the coastal zone for mutually beneficial uses.

7 83. A third policy of the Coastal Act is to "assure priority for coastal-dependent and
8 coastal-related development over other development on the coast." (Pub. Res. Code ยง 30001.5(d).)

9 Oil and gas development in the County coastal zone is necessarily "coastal-dependent" and "coastal-
10 related" because the development "depends" on and "relates" to subsurface minerals confined within

11 the coastal zone. The CZO amendments do not "assure priority" for these developments, instead,
12 they significantly restrict development of oil and gas within the coastal zone. In fact, the CZO
13 amendments afford zero priority oil and gas development.

14 84. Accordingly, the CZO amendments are not exempt under Public Resources Code

15 section 21080.9. The County must analyze the CZO amendments in compliance with CEQA.

16 IMPROPER PIECEMEALING

17 85. Under CEQA, an agency is generally prohibited from "segmenting" or
18 "piecemealing" a project into separate parts to avoid full disclosure of environmental impacts. (See,

19 e.g., Orinda Assn. V. Bd. of Supervisors (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 1145, 1171 ["A public agency is not
20 permitted to subdivide a single project into smaller individual subprojects in order to avoid the
21 responsibility of considering the environmental impact of the project as a whole"], emphasis added.)

22 86. On September 15, 2020, the Board of Supervisors certified an EIR for the GPU and
23 approved the GPU. As discussed above, the GPU included a number of Oil and Gas Policies that

24 restrict and establish additional requirements for new oil and gas development in the County.
25 However, the County failed to analyze or disclose the impacts of the cumulative changes to oil and

26 gas regulations by impermissibly piecemealing its analysis in the GPU EIR and omitting
27 consideration of the alrcady envisioned Zoning Amendments.

28 87. The purpose of a cumulative impact analysis is to avoid considering projects in a

20
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

vacuum, because failure to consider cumulative harm may risk environmental disaster. (Whitman v.
2 Bd. of Supervisors (1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 397, 408.) Agencies cannot allow "environmental
Il considerations [to] become submerged by chopping a large project into many little ones-each with

a minimal potential impact on the environment--which cumulatively may have disastrous
consequences." (Bozung V. Local Agency Formation Com. (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 283-284

6 [superseded by statute on separate grounds].) Without cumulative analysis, piecemeal approval of

7 several projects with related impacts will lead to severe environmental harm. (San Joaquin
8 Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Ctr. V. County of Stanislaus (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 713, 720.)

88. The certified GPU EIR expressly anticipated the Zoning Amendments, yet the County
10 has made no effort to include and consider cumulative impacts from the Zoning Amendments in the

11 GPU EIR. The GPU and Zoning Amendments are fundamentally related. The County has stated
12 that the Zoning Amendments "would help implement the General Plan's vision statement, guiding
13 principles, and numerous policies ...ยป19 In fact, the Zoning Amendments do not just implement the
14 Oil and Gas Policies adopted in the GPU, but significantly broaden the scope and impose new
15  restrictions on oil and gas operations that significantly increase the direct and cumulative impacts to

16 mineral resources from the adoption of the GPU. The County has conceded that the GPU's Oil and

17 Gas Policies would "reduce the locations where, and types of, new oil production facilities that can

18 be discretionarily permitted by the County" and that the Zoning Amendments "would make these

19 new policies applicable to a broader range of proposed oil and gas development based on the new
20 discretionary approval requirement for projects which, under the status quo, only requires a
21 ministerial approval.20

22 89. Because the County concluded that the GPU's Oil and Gas Policies would have
23 significant and unavoidable impacts on the environment, and that the Zoning Amendments would
24 broaden the applicability of those policies, it is quite clear that the Oil and Gas Policies and Zoning
25 Amendments would have cumulatively significant effects on the environment. Yet the County
26 ignored these cumulative impacts and instead segmented the Zoning Amendments from the GPU.

27

28 19
20 Revised Board Letter, p. 8, emphasis added. (Id., emphasis added.)

21
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

By ignoring projects "which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences," the County engaged

2 in illegal piecemealing under CEQA and deprived the public of an informed review. (Bozung, supra,

3 13 Cal.3d at 283-284.)

4 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

5 Violation of CEQA - Improper Use of Categorical Exemption

6 (Public Resources Code ยง 21000, et seq.)

7 90. WSPA realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as though
8 fully set forth herein.

9 91. Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in the
10 manner required by law in filing a NOE for the NCZO amendments and failing to prepare an initial

11 study and/or environmental impact report to identify, analyze, disclose, and mitigate significant
12 environmental impacts from the NCZO amendments prior to approving them.

13 92. The NCZO amendments constitute a "project" under CEQA. (Pub. Res. Code

14 ยง 21065; Guidelines ยง 15378(a).)

15 93. The Board of Supervisors incorrectly determined that the NCZO amendments are

16 categorically exempt from environmental review under CEQA based on the Class 8 Exemption.

17 which applies to "actions taken by regulatory agencies, as authorized by state or local ordinance, to

18 assure the maintenance, restoration, enhancement, or protection of the environment where the
19 regulatory process involves procedures for the protection of the environment."

20 94. The Class 8 exemption does not apply to the NCZO amendments because the Board

21 of Supervisors is a legislative body, not a regulatory agency. a

22 95. The Class 8 cxemption is also inapplicable because the NCZO amendments will have
23 significant effects on the environment, including impacts to mineral resources and greenhouse gas

24 emissions. The NCZO amendments will broaden the applicability of the GPU Oil and Gas Policies,

25 which the Final EIR for the GPU found will have significant and unavoidable effects on the
26 environment. Thus, the Final EIR for the GPU itself provides substantial evidence that the NCZO
27 amendments will have significant effects on the environment.

28 96. At all times relevant herein, Respondents knew or should have known that substantial

22
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

evidence supported the conclusion that the Class 8 Exemption is inapplicable to the NCZO
2 amendments for the reasons stated herein.

3 97. Under Guidelines section 15300.2(c), "[a] categorical exemption shall not be used

4 for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect

5 on the environment due to unusual circumstances." The Class 8 Exemption claimed by Respondents
6 for the NCZO amendments cannot be used under CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c), because the

7 NCZO amendments present unusual circumstances, and there is a reasonable possibility that a
8 significant environmental impact will result from those unusual circumstances, including impacts to

9 greenhouse gas emissions and mineral resources.

10 98. Further, the Class 8 Exemption claimed by Respondents for the NCZO amendments
11 cannot be used under CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(b) because NCZO amendments in
12 conjunction with the GPU Oil and Gas Policies will have a cumulatively significant impact on the
13 environment, including on mineral resources and greenhouse gas emissions.

14 99. Moreover, since the County has not produced any evidence that the NCZO
15 amendments will have no adverse effect on the environment, the County "cannot say with certainty
16 | 'there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the
17 environment.โข" (California Unions for Reliable Energy v. Mojave Desert Air Quality Management
18 Dist., (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1245-1246, citing Dunn-Edwards Corp, supra, 9 Cal.App.4th
19 at p. 658.)

20 100. For the foregoing reasons, the exception provided in CEQA Guidelines sections

21 15300.2(b) and 15300.2(c) applies.

22 101. Respondents have failed to comply with the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA
23 Guidelines prior to approving the NCZO amendments.

24 102. Respondents' actions in adopting the NCZO amendments without full compliance
25 with the requirements of CEQA, as alleged herein, were arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of
26 discretion. Respondents' failure to conduct any CEQA review prior to approving the NCZO
27 amendments further constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion for failure to proceed in a manner
28 required by law. (Pub. Res. Code ยง 21168.5.)

23
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

103. WSPA performed any and all conditions precedent prior to filing this action and has

2 exhausted all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

104. As the NCZO amendments are not exempt from CEQA under CEQA Guidelines
4 section 15308, or any other CEQA exemption, the County as the lead agency must prepare an initial

5 study to be followed by the appropriate environmental document. (Guidelines ยง 15063(a); San
6 Lorenzo Valley, supra, 139 Cal.App.4th at p. 1373.) Respondents failed to comply with these legal
7 requirements because the County did not prepare an initial study in connection with its approval of

8 the NCZO amendments or otherwise conduct any environmental review under CEQA prior to its

9 approval of the NCZO amendments.

10 105. For the foregoing reasons, a writ of mandate should issue, commanding Respondents

11 to rescind their action approving the NCZO amendments, until such time as Respondents have
12 properly complied with the requirements of CEQA.

13 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

14 Violation of CEQA - Improper Use of Statutory Exemption

15 (Public Resources Code ยง 21000, et seq.)

16 106. WSPA realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as though
17 fully set forth herein.

18 107. Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in the

19 manner required by law in filing a NOE for the CZO amendments and failing to prepare an initial

20 study and/or environmental impact report to identify, analyze, disclose, and mitigate significant

21 environmental impacts from the CZO amendments prior to approving them.

22 108. The CZO amendments constitute a "project" under CEQA. (Pub. Res. Code ยง 21065;

23 Guidelines ยง 15378(a).)

24 109. The Board of Supervisors incorrectly determined that the CZO amendments are

25 statutorily exempt from environmental review pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21080.9

26 as an amendment to an LCP.

27 110. The statutory exemption under Public Resources Code section 21080.9 does not
28 apply because the CZO amendments do not constitute amendments to an LCP.

24
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 111. Respondents' actions in adopting the CZO amendments without full compliance with
2 the requirements of CEQA, as alleged herein, were arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion.
3 Respondents' failure to conduct any CEQA review prior to approving the CZO amendments further

4 constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion for failure to proceed in a manner required by law. (Pub.

5 Res. Code ยง 21168.5.)

6 112. WSPA performed any and all conditions precedent prior to filing this action and has
7 exhausted all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

8 113. As the NCZO amendments are not exempt from CEQA under Public Resources Code
9 section 21080.9, or any other CEQA exemption, the County as the lead agency must prepare an
10| initial study to be followed by the appropriate environmental document. (Guidelines ยง 15063(a);

11 San Lorenzo Valley, supra, 139 Cal.App.4th at p 1373.) Respondents failed to comply with these
12 legal requirements because the County did not prepare an initial study in connection with its approval
13 of the CZO amendments or otherwise conduct any environmental review under CEQA prior to its

14 approval of the CZO amendments.

15 114. For the foregoing a reasons, a writ of mandate should issue, commanding Respondents
16 to rescind their action approving the CZO amendments, until such time as Respondents have

17 properly complied with the requirements of CEQA.

18 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
19 Violation of CEQA - Improper Piecemealing

20 (Public Resources Code ยง 21000, et seq.)

21 115. WSPA realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as though
22 fully set forth herein.

23 116. Under CEQA, an agency is generally prohibited from "segmenting" or

24 | "piecemealing" a project into separate parts to avoid full disclosure of environmental impacts.
25| (Orinda Assn., supra, 182 Cal.App.3d at p. 1171.)

26 117. The Zoning Amendments constitute "projects" under CEQA. (Pub. Res. Code
27 ยง 21065; Guidelines ยง 15378(a).)

28 118. The GPU constitutes & "project" under CEQA. The County analyzed the GPU in an

25
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

EIR and determined that the GPU would have significant and unavoidable impacts on the

2 environment.

3 119. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion and violated CEQA by unlawfully
4 segmenting the Zoning Amendments from the GPU to avoid CEQA review.

120. The "requirements of CEQA cannot be avoided by piecemeal review which results

6 from chopping a large project into many little ones-each with a minimal potential impact on the
7 environment-which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences." (Envt'l Prot. Info. Clr. v.
8 Cal. Dept. of Forestry & Fire Prot. (2008) 44 Cal.4th 459, 503, quoting Rio Vista Farm Bureau
9 Center v. County of Solano (1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 351, 370.)

10 121. Rather, when a lead agency undertakes the environmental review process, the lead

11 agency must review and consider the "whole of the action," (CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15378), and

12 consider "the effects, both individual and collective, of all activities involved in [the] project." (Pub.
13 Resources Code, ยง 21002.1(d).)

14 122. Respondents failed to conduct a full environmental review and consideration of the
15 Zoning Amendments and GPU together before adopting the Zoning Amendments.

16 123. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law by taking the above-
17 described actions in violation of CEQA. Respondents' actions were not supported by substantial
18 evidence.

19 124. Because CEQA prohibits a disjointed, a piecemeal process, a writ of mandate should
20 issue, commanding Respondents to rescind their action approving the Zoning Amendments, until
21 such time as Respondents have properly complied with the requirements of CEQA.

22 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

23 Violation of CEQA - Improper Reliance on Prior EIR

24 (Publie Resources Code ยง 21000, et seq.)

25 125. WSPA rcalleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as though
26 fully set forth herein.

27 126. Public Resources Code section 21166, and its implementing Guidelines section
28 15162, mandate that once a public agency has prepared an EIR for a project, no further EIR is

26
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

required unless either (1) substantial changes are proposed in the project that will require major
2 revisions of the EIR, or (2) substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which

3 the project will be undertaken that will require major revisions in the EIR, or (3) new information,

4 which was not known and could not have been known when the EIR was certified, becomes
5 available.

6 127. On September 15, 2020, the Board of Supervisors certified an EIR for the GPU and
7 approved the GPU. The Draft EIR for the GPU acknowledged that the County was "considering
8 amending its zoning ordinances.ยป21 But the EIR failed to analyze the significant cumulative effects
9 the Zoning Amendments and GPU Oil and Gas Policies would have on the environment. The EIR
10 failed to conduct this analysis even though the Zoning Amendments were a "probable future

11 project." (Pub. Res. Code ยง 21083(b)(2); Guidelines ยงยง 15064(h)(1), 15065(a)(3).)

12 128. The County must prepare a further EIR for the GPU because substantial changes have

13 occurred with respect to the circumstances under which the GPU will be undertaken that will require
14 major revisions to the EIR. This includes substantial changes to the CZO and NCZO vis a vis the a
15 Zoning Amendments, which broaden the scope of the GPU's Oil and Gas Policies and will result in
16 new and more severe significant impacts on the environment that were not considered in the EIR.

17 129. The County must also prepare a further EIR because new information, which was not
18 known and could not have been known when the EIR was certified, has bccome available. The
19 significant individual and cumulative environmental effects of the Zoning Amendments were not
20 fully known at the time the County certified the EIR for the GPU because the Zoning Amendments

21 had not yet been adopted at that time. The new information regarding the significant individual and
22 cumulative environmental effects of the Zoning Amendments shows that (1) the GPU will have
23 significant effects not evaluated in the EIR for the GPU and (2) significant effects previously
24examined in the EIR for the GPU, including significant and unavoidable impacts to mineral
25  resources and greenhouse gas emissions, will be substantially more severe than shown in the EIR.

26 130. The County violated CEQA by unlawfully adopting the Zoning Amendments without
27 first preparing a further EIR for the GPU that adcquately addressed the additional environmental

28 21 See, e.g., Ventura County 2040 General Plan Update Draft EIR, p. 4.12-22.

27
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 effects caused by the Zoning Amendments.

2 131. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law by taking the above-
3 described actions in violation of CEQA. Respondents' actions were not supported by substantial

4 evidence.

5 132. Because CEQA requires a further EIR when (1) substantial changes occur with

6 respect to the circumstances under which the project will be undertaken that will require major
7 revisions in the EIR or (2) new information, which was not known and could not have been known
8 when the EIR was certified, becomes available, a writ of mandate should issue, commanding
9 Respondents to rescind their action approving the Zoning Amendments, until such time as
10 Respondents have properly complied with the requirements of CEQA.

11 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

12 (Petition for Writ of Traditional Mandamus Under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1085 or

13 Alternatively under Section 1094.5 - Preemption)

14 133. WSPA realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as though

15 fully set forth herein.

16 134. WSPA seeks a writ of traditional mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

17 section 1085, or alternative section 1094.5. The adoption of the Zoning Amendments is preempted

18 because the County is preempted from intruding upon the state's exclusive jurisdiction over certain

19 parts of oil and gas regulations.

20 135. California has adopted numerous statutes and regulations that comprehensively

21 regulate virtually all aspects of oil and gas operations. Oil and gas operations are specifically

22 governed by Division 3 of the Public Resources Code (Pub. Res. Code ccn 3000, et seq.) and its

23 implementing regulations (14 C.C.R. ยง 1712, et seq.) By and through this all-encompassing
24 statutory and regulatory scheme, the State of California, through the California Department of
25 Conservation, Geologic Energy Management Division ("CalGEM"), has exclusive jurisdiction over
26 the field of oil and gas operations, methods, and procedures to the exclusion of local legislation.

27 136. The Zoning Amendments impermissibly attempt to regulate, restrict, prohibit, render
28 infeasible, and/or impair oil and gas subsurface operations by imposing severe restrictions on oil and

28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

gas development in the County and broadening the applicability of the GPU's Oil and Gas Policies.

2 137. GPU Policy COS-7.4 attempts to require evaluations of well stimulation treatment
3 and enhanced oil recovery projects for seismic, groundwater, greenhouse gas emission, and other

4 impacts. This Policy is preempted, including by Senate Bill 4, codified in Pub. Res. Code. ยง 3150,

5 et seq. Senate Bill 4 explicitly directs CalGEM to promulgate extensive regulations governing well
6 stimulation treatments in California.

7 138. GPU Policy COS-7.5 requires restoration for oil and gas sites. GPU Policy COS-7.5

8 is preempted, including by 14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง 1776, which requires well sites to be returned to as

9 a near a natural state as practicable within 60-days of plugging and abandonment of any oil and gas

10 well. Section 1776 also requires oilfield lease restoration to include the removal of all tanks, above-
ground pipelines, debris, and other facilities equipment.

12 139. GPU Policy COS-7.6 indicates that the County "shall evaluate discretionary
13 development to identify any abandoned oil and gas wells on the project site." This Policy is

14 preempted, including by Public Resources Code section 3208.1, which establishes well re-
15 abandonment responsibility when a previously plugged and abandoned well will be impacted by

16 planned property development or construction activities. Section 3208.1 gives CalGEM the
17| authority to order or permit the re-abandonment of any well wherc it has reason to question the
18 integrity of the previous abandonment, or if the well is not accessible or visible.

19 140. GPU Policy COS-7.8 attempts to restrict flaring of natural gas on new wells except
20 for emergencies and testing. Policy COS-7.8 is preempted, including by state law that expressly

21 provides for flaring of natural gas (Pub. Res. Code ยงยง 3300, 3500-3503; 17 Cal. Code Regs.

22 ยงยง 95665-95677) as does the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District (*VCAPCD"), such as
23 during emergencies, testing power outages, and maintenance of wells, facilities, and pipelines. This

24 Policy is also preempted by 40 C.F.R. Part 60, Subpart A General Provisions, which regulates flares,
25 including those at oil and gas facilities. Policy COS-7.8 is further preempted by state regulations

26 that cover measurement and reporting of flare emissions. (See, e.g., 40 C.F.R. Part 98 Mandatory
27 Greenhouse Gas Reporting; 17 Cal. Code Regs., Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting).

28 141. The Zoning Amendments impose additional restrictions on oil and gas development

29
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

- and broaden the applicability of the GPU Oil and Gas Policies to effectively halt the industry in

2 Ventura County. The County concedes that the Zoning Amendments will make the GPU's Oil and

3 Gas Policies "applicable to a broader range of proposed oil and gas development based on the new
4 discretionary approval requirement for projects which, under the status quo, only requires a

5 ministerial approval."22

6 142. By adopting the oning Amendments, Respondents have acted unlawfully and
7 beyond the scope of their statutory authority and regulatory authority as set forth in California and

8 federal law.

9 143. Respondents have acted arbitrarily and capriciously and have abused their discretion.

10 144. WSPA has a beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondents do not enforce the
11 Zoning Amendments that exceed their authority and are preempted by state and federal statutes.

12 WSPA and its members dedicate themselves to ensuring that Americans continue to have reliable

13 access to petroleum and petroleum products through policies that are socially, economically, and
14 environmentally responsible. The Zoning Amendments will slow, reduce, or render infeasible the

15 potential expansion of new local oil and gas development, which will hinder reliable access to
petroleum and petroleum products. In addition, several of WSPA's members own and operate 16

17 petroleum exploration and production operations in Ventura County that are subject to the Zoning

18 Amendments.

19 145. WSPA is irreparably harmed by the County's adoption of the Zoning Amendments.

20 146. WSPA has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law to challenge the Zoning

21 Amendments other than the relief sought herein. Without the resolution of these challenges, WSPA

22 will be permanently and irreparably harmed by implementation of the Zoning Amendments.

23 147. Because the adoption of the Zoning Amendments is quasi-legislative in nature and
24 not adjudicatory, WSPA brings this action under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. In the
25 alternative, however, WSPA also secks a writ of mandamus under Code of Civil Procedure section

26 1094.5 to the extent, if any, that the Court concludes section 1094.5 is applicable here.

SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Declaratory Relief - Preemption)

3 148. WSPA realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as though
4 fully set forth herein.

5 149. Pursuant to federal and state law, the power and authority to regulate oil and gas
6 operations, methods, and procedures in California lies exclusively in the State of California,
7 including with CalGEM. The Zoning Amendments purport to regulate, restrict, prohibit, render
8 infeasible, and/or impair subsurface operations in the County, including by broadening the

9 applicability of the GPU Oil and Gas Policies, and are in direct conflict with superior California law,
10 including, without limitation, the sections of the California Public Resources Code relating to oil

11 and gas production, Senate Bill 4, CalGEM regulations, and permits lawfully issued by CalGEM.

12 150. Respondents lack the power, authority, and jurisdiction to indirectly prohibit or
13 | impair subsurface operations by imposing restrictive policies, as that power is exclusively a function
14 of the State of California. Moreover, the laws of the State of California preempt and fully occupy

15 regulation of the fields of drilling of oil and gas wells, well stimulation treatment, underground
16 injection control, enhanced oil recovery, well abandonment and re-abandonment, flaring, and
17 restoration of oil and gas sites. The provisions of the Zoning Amendments purporting to regulate,
18 restrict, prohibit, and/or impair subsurface operations are preempted, in whole or in party, by federal
19 and state law, and, as such, are invalid and without effect.

20 151. WSPA is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Defendants dispute the
21 contentions set forth above.

22 152. Judicial intervention in these disputes, and a declaration by the Court, is necessary to
23 resolve whether the Zoning Amendments are preempted, in whole or in part, by federal and state

24  law.

25 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

26 (Petition for Writ of Traditional Mandamus Under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1085

27 or Alternatively under Section 1094.5 - Inconsistency with California Coastal Act)

28 153. WSPA realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as though

31
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

- fully set forth herein.

2 154. WSPA seeks a writ of traditional mandamus pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
3 section 1085, or alternatively section 1094.5. The County improperly determined that the CZO
4 Amendments are consistent with the California Coastal Act ("Coastal Act").

5 155. The Coastal Act is a comprehensive statutory scheme to protect the environment of

6 California's coastal zone. (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553,
7 571.)

8 156. Among other things, the Coastal Act requires the implementation of LCPs that
9 embody statewide standards for preserving the coastal zone. (Citizens of Goleta, supra, 52 Cal.3d
10 at p. 571.) Local government has the initial responsibility to prepare an LCP or LCP amendment

11 covering the coastal zone within its jurisdiction. (Pub. Res. Code ยง 30500.) The local government

12 then submits the LCP or amendment to the California Coastal Commission ("Commission"). (id. at

13 ยง 30510.) The submission must include a complete environmental review and satisfy other policies

14 and regulations of the Commission. (id. at ยง 30510-30514.)

15 157. Land use within the County's unincorporated coastal zone is governed by the
16 County's Coastal Area Plan (CAP"), the CZO, and two adopted Categorical Exclusion Orders
17 (Order E-83-1 and amendment E-83-1A). The CAP is the County's coastal area land use plan
18 addressing the type, location, and intensity of land uses, applicable resource protection and
19 development policies and, where necessary, a listing of implementing actions. The CAP was
20 certified by the Coastal Commission in June 1982.

21 158. The Coastal Commission will certify the CZO amendments as amendments to the
22 County's LCP if the amendments are in conformance with the Coastal Act policies and are adequate

23 to carry out the provisions of the CAP. (14 C.C.R. ยง 13540.)

24 159. In submitting a proposed LCP amendment to the Coastal Commission for review and
25 certification, the County was required to include an analysis of the amendment's consistency with
26 the Coastal Act. (14 C.C.R. ยงยง 13552, 13511.)

27 160. The Planning Commission conducted this analysis and determined that the CZO
28 amendments were consistent with the Coastal Act. The Planning Commission attached this analysis

32
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

as Exhibit 8 to the Board Letter in advance of the November 10, 2020 Board of Supervisors meeting.
2 The Board subsequently voted to find that the CZO Amendments are consistent with the Coastal

3 Act.

4 161. Respondents acted arbitrarily and capriciously, prejudicially abused their discretion,

5 and failed to proceed in the manner required by law by finding that the CZO Amendments are

6 consistent with the Coastal Act.

7 162. The CZO Amendments are inconsistent with the Coastal Act for several reasons,
including because they:
9 A. Discourage oil and gas facilities within the coastal zone, which are coastal-
10 dependent facilities, from locating or expanding within existing sites. (Pub. Res.

11 Code ยง 30260.) The CZO Amendments also function to prohibit or render

12 infeasible long-term growth of coastal-dependent oil and gas industrial facilities.

13 (Id.)

14 B. Hamper oil and gas development even though such development meets the

15 conditions set forth under Pub. Res. Code ยง 30262.

16 C. Will not ensure the balanced utilization and conservation of coastal zone

17 resources taking into account the social and economic nceds of the people the

18 state," including because the CZO Amendments will significantly hamper, limit,

19 and render infeasible the utilization of the coastal zone for oil and gas

20 development. (Pub. Res. Code ยง 30001.5(b).)

21 D. Discourage "state and local initiatives and cooperation in preparing procedures to

22 implement coordinated planning and development for mutually beneficial uses,
23 including educational uses, in the coastal zone," including by implanting

24 restrictions that will hamper, reduce, and render infeasible the expansion of oil
25 and gas development for mutually beneficial uses. (Pub. Res. Code

26 ยง 30001.5(e).)

27 E. Fail to "assure priority for coastal-dependent and coastal-related development

28 over other development on the coast" through restrictions that will hamper,

33
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 reduce, and render infeasible the expansion of coastal-dependent and coastal-

2 related oil and gas development. (Pub. Res. Code ยง 30001.5(d).)

3 163. By finding that the Zoning Amendments are consistent with the Coastal Act,

4 Respondents have acted unlawfully and beyond the scope of their statutory authority and regulatory
5 authority as set forth in California and federal law.

6 164. Respondents have acted arbitrarily and capriciously and have abused their discretion.

7 165. WSPA has a beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondents do not enforce the
8 Zoning Amendments that exceed their authority and are inconsistent with the Coastal Act.

9 166. WSPA is irreparably harmed by the County's finding that the Zoning Amendments

10 are consistent with the Coastal Act.

11 167. WSPA has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law to challenge the County's
12 findings other than the relief sought herein. Without the resolution of these challenges, WSPA will

13 be permanently and irreparably harmed.

14 168. Because the County's finding is quasi-legislative in nature and not adjudicatory,

15 WSPA brings this action under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. In the alternative, however,

16 WSPA also seeks a writ of mandamus under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 to the extent,

17 if any, that the Court concludes section 1094.5 is applicable here.

18 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

19 (Declaratory Relief -Inconsistency with California Coastal Act)

20 169. WSPA realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as though

21 fully set forth herein.

22 170. In submitting proposed LCP amendment to the Coastal Commission for review and
23 certification, the County was required to include an analysis of the amendment's consistency with
24 the Coastal Act. (14 C.C.R. ยงยง 13552, 13511.) The County improperly found and determined that
25 the CZO Amendments are consistent with the Coastal Act.

26 171. WSPA is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Defendants dispute the
27 contentions set forth above.

28 172. Judicial intervention in these disputes, and a declaration by the Court, is necessary to

34
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 resolve whether the CZO Amendments are consistent with the Coastal Act.

2 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

3 WHEREFORE, WSPA prays for judgement and further relief as follows:

4 A. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate, commanding the County:

5 1. To vacate and set aside approval of the Zoning Amendments taken in

6 violation of CEQA;

7 2. To prepare and certify a legally adequate CEQA document for the Zoning

8 Amendments;
9 3. To vacate and set aside the County's finding that the CZO Amendments are
10 consistent with the California Coastal Act;

11 4. To suspend any and all activity pursuant to the County's approval of the

12 Zoning Amendments that could result in an adverse change or alteration to

13 the physical environment until the County has complied with all

14 requirements of CEQA and all other applicable state and local laws, policies,

15 ordinances, and regulations as are directed by this Court pursuant to Public

16 Resources Code section 21168.9;

17 B. For preliminary and permanent injunctive relief enjoining Respondents, and each of

18 them, from engaging in any activity pursuant to the Zoning Amendments until the

19 Zoning Amendments comply with CEQA and all other applicable state and local

20 laws, policies, ordinances, and regulations;

24 Amendments are void ab initio or otherwise invalid and have no legal effect;

25 E. For a declaratory judgment that Respondents' failure to prepare, consider, approve

Re: Notice of Intent to File CEQA Lawsuit

Dear County Clerk:
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code ยง 21167.5, that Petitioner and
Plaintiff, Western States Petroleum Association ("WSPA"), will file suit against Defendants and
Respondents, County of Ventura and Ventura County Board of Supervisors, for failure to
observe the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public
Resources Code ยง 21000, et seq., and the CEQA Guidelines, California Code of Regulations ยง 15000, et seq., in the administrative process that culminated in the County's November 10, 2020 decision to adopt amendments to the Ventura County Coastal Zoning Ordinance ("CZO") and Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance ("NCZO") (collectively, "Zoning Amendments") without first
complying with CEQA.

The relief that WSPA intends to seek with the Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint
includes, but is not limited to, the following:

For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate, commanding the County:

o To vacate and set aside approval of the Zoning Amendments taken in violation
of CEQA;

o To prepare and certify a legally adequate CEQA document for the Zoning
Amendments;

o To vacate and set aside approval of the Zoning Amendments taken in violation
of the Brown Act;

4. E-mail Address: mindy.fogg@ventura.org

C. Exempt Status:
Categorical Exemption: Section 15308: Actions by regulatory agencies for protection of the environment.

D. Justification for Exemption:
Adoption of the Ordinance is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act
(CEQA) pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15308 as an action taken by a regulatory agency, as authorized by state or local ordinance, "to assure the
maintenance, restoration, enhancement, or protection of the environment where the regulatory process involves procedures for protection of the environment." Because certain special use permits authorizing oil and gas exploration and production activities were granted by the County of Ventura (County) before enactment of CEQA in 1970, none of the original oil and gas operations covered by these permits underwent CEQA review. Many operations authorized under these permits have been expanded or modified subsequently under the NCZO's ministerial zoning clearance a process, a situation which the Ordinance amends.
The Ordinance assures the County's maintenance and protection of the
environment by requiring the discretionary approval of, and environmental review under CEQA for, all new oil and gas development by implementing a single, uniform
review process for such new development proposed in the unincorporated areas of
the county. Oil and gas development can result in potentially significant adverse
impacts to a number of important resource issue areas including, but not limited to, air quality, public health and safety, climate change, land subsidence, as well as water resources, biological resources, and agricultural, visual, and recreational resources. Potential impacts from oil and gas development can also implicate environmental justice issues.

By requiring discretionary approval for all new oil and gas development, the Ordinance enables the County to achieve the five major objectives of CEQA: (1) study and disclose potential environmental impacts; (2) prevent or reduce environmental damage; (3) disclose and provide reasoning for County permitting decisions; (4) promote interagency coordination; and (5) encourage public participation. (Pub. Resources Code, ยงยง 21000-21004; CEQA Guidelines, ยงยง15002,
15086 and 15087.)

exempts local governments from preparing an environmental impact report or
other CEQA document in connection with an amendment to an LCP. Instead,
certification of an LCP amendment by the California Coastal Commission (Coastal
Commission) is required and is subject to Coastal Commission review for compliance with the California Coastal Act of 1972.

section 21080.5 as the functional equivalent of CEQA review

Re: Demand to Correct Brown Act Violations

Dear Honorable Members of the Board:

Pursuant to Government Code section 54960.1, we submit this demand on behalf of the
Western States Petroleum Association ("WSPA") that the Board of Supervisors correct violations of the Ralph M. Brown Act ("Brown Act") that occurred during the Board's November 10, 2020 meeting. Government Code section 54960.1 provides that any interested person may
commence an action for the purpose of obtaining a judicial determination that an action taken
by legislative body of a local agency violated the Brown Act's open meeting laws and is null
and void. As a pre-requisite to filing such an action, it is required that WSPA make a demand of
the Board to correct its action.

The requirements of the Brown Act apply to meetings of this Board. (Cal. Gov. Code,
: 54952.) Pursuant to the Brown Act, "public commission, boards and councils and the other
public agencies in this State exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business." (Cal. Gov. Code ยง 54950.) The Brown Act specifically intends to ensure that all meetings of the legislative body are open, public, and all persons are permitted to attend. (Cal. Gov. Code ยง 54950.) Meetings subject to the Brown Act are not limited to face-to-face gatherings but include any
or communication meeting or device through which a majority of a legislative body deliberates, discusses or takes action. While the public's business must be conducted in open, noticed
meetings, the public also has the right to participate in all meetings. (Cal. Gov. Code
ยง 54954.3(a).)

The Brown Act requires that the Board post an agenda at least 72-hours prior to its
meetings. Specifically, Government Code section 54954.2 states, "At least 72 hours before a
regular meeting, the legislative body of the local agency, or its designee, shall post an agenda

containing a brief general description of each item of business to be transacted or discussed at
the meeting, including items to be discussed in closed session" (emphasis added). During the
November 10 hearing on Agenda Item 47, Planning Director Dave Ward informed the Board that
the Resource Management Agency was changing one of its recommendations to the Board
regarding Agenda Item 47. He stated, "the clerk has an item that updated one of your
recommendations in your board letter which is recommendation number two, which relates to
the findings requested to be made today in regards to CEQA." The "updated" recommendation
Mr. Ward had referenced was the Resource Management Agency's recommendation that the
Board find to the extent commenters have raised issues about the application of new 2040 General Plan policies to new oil and gas wells, that those impacts factually are the same as the impacts evaluated in the EIR for the General Plan Update, that there is no new or substantially
more severe impact requiring a further EIR under CEQA Guidelines section 15162, and that it is
appropriate to rely on that certified EIR for the extension of those policies to new oil and gas
wells, and reliance on that EIR is an independent basis under CEQA for the adoption of the
proposed zoning ordinance amendments.

But these "updated" actions were never included in the agenda that was posted in
advance of the Board's November 10 hearing. In addition, the recommended action was not
included in the Resource Management Agency's letter to the Board in advance of the meeting,
which was embedded in the hyperlink to Agenda Item 47. Shockingly, it was not until after the November 10 meeting had concluded and the Board voted to approve Agenda Item 47 that the County proceeded to upload a "Revised Board Letter," which contained the "updated" recommended actions Mr. Ward had referenced during the meeting. The County violated the Brown Act by failing to describe these recommended actions in its agenda.

The Brown Act also prohibits requiring registration to attend a public meeting. No in- person participation was available for the November 10 meeting. Instead, the agenda for the
meeting noted that the building is closed to the public, and further noted that participants should attend online. However, none of the provided options for submitting comments were sufficient. The agenda noted that to comment via Zoom, participant was required to register.
Comments made while watching the livestream are only read at the "discretion of the chair"
and thus this was not an adequate substitute for full and open participation. The agenda did not
provide the necessary clarity required by the Brown Act that registration cannot be required to attend a public meeting. (Cal. Gov. Code, ยง 54953.3.) The Board of Supervisors has not adequately complied with this requirement to allow public participation in the current
pandemic.

In addition, while the County provided instruction as to how the public can electronically
attend hearings and provide public comment, in practice it's a confusing and complicated
process since each participation method has a separate registration process, deadline, and
requirements. Not all Ventura County community members have equal access to the

5:16:10 minute mark.

Demand to Correct Brown Act Violations

technology required to participate in virtual hearings. Indeed, approximately 8,000 residents in Ventura County do not have access to any wired Internet.2 Thus, thousands of Ventura County
Residents were left out of what has already proved to be an incredibly contentious topic related
to oil and gas development in the County. Technological disparities including access to Internet and reliable computers may prevent segments of the community from full participation in important aspects of the County's decision-making process as required under the Brown Act.

Of course, WSPA supports the County's efforts to address and mitigate a pandemic that
has plagued the County and nation, but the County's alternative procedures are not a lawful
substitute. Such attempts to diminish the public's ability to effectively participate in the
discussion on the proposed amendments to the Zoning Codes will not be tolerated. Accordingly,
WSPA demands that the Board of Supervisors cure or correct the serious Brown Act violations identified above that will undermine the validity of the November 10, 2020 meeting. The
County has 30-days to take corrective action under Government Code section 54960.1. Please
notify WSPA of any intent to cure the Brown Act violations prior to the running of the 30-day
period.

Sincerely,
ddett Leluliuoloo.
