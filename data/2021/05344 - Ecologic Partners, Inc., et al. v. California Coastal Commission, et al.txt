VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. The Oceano Dunes State Vehicle Recreation Area ("ODSVRA") is a state-

3 designated off-highway vehicle ("OHV") park managed and operated by Respondent California

4 Department of Parks and Recreation ("State Parks") for the benefit of residents of, and visitors to,

5 the state of California. The ODSVRA was initially established in 1974 as the "Pismo Dunes State

6 Vehicle Recreation Area". State Parks changed the name of the park to ODSVRA in 1994. Certain

7 development activities at the ODSVRA are regulated under Coastal Development Permit No. 4-82-

8 300, as amended ("CDP 4-82-300"), which State Parks applied for, and Respondent California
9 Coastal Commission (the "Commission") approved, in 1982.

10 2. On March 18, 2021, the Commission amended CDP 4-82-300 to require that State
11 Parks phase out and eliminate OHV use at ODSVRA within three (3) years. The Commission took

12 this action without conducting the type of environmental impact review required under the
13 California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA; Pub.Res.Code §§ 21000 et seq) and the
14 Commission's approved alternative regulatory program. Specifically, the Commission prepared no
15 analysis of the proposed amendment's impacts on the physical and human environment. The only

16 document the Commission prepared and made available to the public was the Commission Staff

17 Report, which did not evaluate the impacts of the proposed amendments to CDP 4-82-300 or

18 discuss alternatives or mitigation measures that would address such impacts. For this reason, the

19 Commission's amendment to CDP 4-82-300 violated CEQA.

20 3. The Commission's decision to order State Parks to terminate OHV use at the

21 ODSVRA went beyond the Commission's regulatory authority under the California Coastal Act.
22 Neither the Coastal Act nor the terms of CDP 4-82-300 give the Commission the power to eliminate
23 OHV use at a state-designated OHV park, especially one that was established prior to enactment of

24 the California Coastal Act.

25 4. The Commission's decision to amend the ODSVRA CDP was not supported by
26 substantial evidence. In addition, the Commission's action was not properly noticed or accurately
27 described in the Commission's agenda. Specifically, the agenda stated that the Commission was
28 considering an amendment to the CDP per an application from State Parks. In reality, the

2
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Commission was intending to eviscerate the CDP and purge it of all terms allowing OHV use at the

2 ODSVRA. There is no evidence that State Parks itself applied for such an "amendment" Rather,

3 the so-called "amendment" was a unilateral action recommended by the Commission staff and then

4 taken by the Commission over the objections of State Parks. For these reasons, the Commission's

5 amendment to the CDP violated the California Coastal Act.

0 5. The Commission's action also rendered meaningless State Parks' ongoing effort to

7 prepare and adopt a Public Works Plan ("PWP") for the ODSVRA pursuant to the California

8 Coastal Act. (Pub.Res.Code § 30605.) State Parks agreed to pursue the PWP at the urging of the
9 Commission, which represented to State Parks that the PWP would be used to supersede the CDP
10 and programmatically address current and future management issues at the ODSVRA consistent

11 with Coastal Act requirements. State Parks spent three years and hundreds of thousands of tax
12 dollars, much of it from State Parks' Off-Highway Motor Vehicle Recreation ("OHMVR")
13 program, to prepare a draft PWP and draft Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"). However, rather
14 than submit comments on the PWP and Draft EIR and allow the PWP process to move forward
15 toward completion, the Commission, through its actions on March 18, 2021, interrupted and
16 effectively killed that process by unlawfully gutting the CDP and demanding that State Parks phase
17 out OHV use at ODSVRA by March 2024. This, too, is a violation of the Coastal Act and CEQA.
18 6. Real party County of San Luis Obispo (the "County") has a Local Coastal Program
19 ("LCP"), certified by the Coastal Commission, which expressly incorporates the ODSVRA and
20 allows OHV use at the ODSVRA, consistent with CDP 4-82-300, as it existed prior to March 18,
21 2021. By amending CDP 4-82-300 to require the complete elimination of OHV use at the ODSVRA

22 in three years, the Commission took an action that is inconsistent with the County's certified LCP.
23 This is also a violation of the Coastal Act.

24 7. For these reasons, among others, the Commission's amendment to CDP 4-82-300

25 constituted an abuse of discretion and must be overturned.

26 PARTIES

27 8. Petitioner EcoLogic Partners, Inc. ("EcoLogic") is a tax-exempt non-profit

28 California corporation dedicated to protecting and preserving public access to recreational venues,

3
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 including designated OHV parks, throughout California and the western United States. EcoLogic is
2 a consortium comprised of the American Sand Association, the American Motorcyclists
3 Association District 37, and the Off-Road Business Association, and their respective members.
4 Since 2002, EcoLogic and its members have been actively involved in the various environmental,
regulatory, and management issues at the ODSVRA, and has participated in Commission meetings

6 and public hearings regarding same. EcoLogic's members routinely visit the ODSVRA to engage in
7 a variety of recreational activities, including camping, hiking, photography, riding OHVs,
8 swimming, beachcombing, and spending time with family and friends. EcoLogic members are

9 especially fond of the ODSVRA because it is the only public beach in California where visitors can

10 drive vehicles on the beach, thereby providing coastal access to all, including persons with
11 disabilities and other mobility challenges. EcoLogic members also visit the ODSVRA because it
12 represents a low-cost alternative to other forms of vacationing, such as air travel, that are too
13 expensive for many families in California. EcoLogic and its members have contributed financially
14 to the State Parks' OHMVR program - the program that funds many of the activities, including the
15 preparation of technical studies, that take place at the ODSVRA. On March 18, 2021, EcoLogic
16 submitted comments to the Commission objecting to the proposed amendments to CDP 4-82-300,
17 including and especially those that called for the phase-out of OHV use at the ODSVRA. EcoLogic
18 also provided testimony during the Commission hearing of March 18, 2021, reiterating its
19 objections to the proposed action and amendments to the CDP. Due to the Commission's actions on

20 March 18, 2021, the interests of EcoLogic and its members have been and will continue to be

21 harmed. The interests that EcoLogic is pursuing in this action are within its goals and purposes.
22 EcoLogic and its members have a direct and beneficial interest in the Commission's and State

23 Parks' compliance with the laws affecting CDP 4-82-300 and the ODSVRA as a whole. These

24 interests will be directly and adversely affected by the Commission's amendment to CDP 4-82-300.
25 By prosecuting this action, EcoLogic will confer a substantial benefit on the public by protection it
26 from the environmental and other harms alleged in this Petition.

27 9. Petitioner Specialty Equipment Market Association ("SEMA") is a California tax-
28 exempt non-profit corporation and trade association that consists of a diverse group of

4
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and individuals engaged in the production, sale, distribution

2 and use of specialty automotive parts, including parts for OHVs. More specifically, SEMA

3 members provide specialty automotive parts and accessories for OHV users, including those who

4 visit the ODSVRA, as well as for various retailers who serve the ODSVRA OHV community. In
addition, some members of SEMA travel to and visit the ODSVRA for their own recreational

6 enjoyment. In addition, SEMA operates the SEMA Action Network ("SAN"), a nationwide

7 partnership of vehicle clubs, enthusiasts and members of the specialty parts industry who want to

8 protect their hobby. Established in 1997, the SAN has over 130,000 individual and car club

O members throughout the United States and Canada. A primary mission the SAN is to support and

10 protect access to motorized recreation venues, such as the ODSVRA. SEMA has an interest in

11 ensuring the Commission and State Parks comply with CEQA, the Coastal Act, and all other

12 applicable laws when establishing regulations and/or amending permits for the ODSVRA. For this

13 reason, SEMA submitted comments to the Commission objecting to the then-proposed amendments

14 to CDP 4-82-300. Due to the Commission's actions on March 18, 2021, the interests of SEMA and

15 its members have been and will continue to be harmed. The interests that SEMA is pursuing in this

16 action are within its goals and purposes. SEMA and its members have a direct and beneficial

17 interest in the Commission's and State Parks' compliance with the laws affecting CDP 4-82-300

18 and the ODSVRA as a whole. These interests will be directly and adversely affected by the

19 Commission's amendment to CDP 4-82-300. By prosecuting this action, SEMA will confer a

20 substantial benefit on the public by protection it from the environmental and other harms alleged in

21 this Petition,

22 10. Respondent California Coastal Commission is a state commission of unelected

23 appointees that operates under the aegis of the California Natural Resources Agency, The

24 Commission is responsible for implementing and enforcing the California Coastal Act (Pub.Res.

25 Code §§ 30000). In that capacity, the Commission reviews and certifies Local Coastal Programs

26 (LCPs) such as the one adopted in by the County of San Luis Obispo. The Commission also has the

27 authority to review, approve, issue, and amend Coastal Development Permits (CDPs), such as CDP

28 4-82-300, which applies to some of State Parks' operations at the ODSVRA. In this case, it was the

5
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Commission which, on March 18, 2021, amended CDP 4-82-300 to require the phase out OHV use

2 at the ODSVRA in three years.

3 11. Respondent John Ainsworth is the Executive Director of the Commission.

4 12. Respondent State Parks is a state department that, like the Commission, operates
under the aegis of the California Natural Resources Agency, Its primary function is to manage the

6 various state parks within California, including the ODSVRA, which was first established as a state

7 park in 1974 under the name "Pismo Beach Off-Road Vehicle Park". In 1982, State Parks applied

8 for and secured from the Commission a Coastal Development Permit covering certain development

9 activities at the ODSVRA - i.e., CDP 4-82-300. According to the Commission, State Parks

10 "applied" for an amendment to CDP 4-82-300 in 2020. This application eventually resulted in the

11 Commission's decision to amend the CDP and require the phase out of OHV use at the ODSVRA.

12 13. Respondent Armando Quintero is the Director of State Parks.

13 14. EcoLogic and SEMA (collectively, "Petitioners") are unaware of the true names and

14 capacities of Respondent Does 1 through 10 and sue such respondents by fictitious names.

15 Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that the fictitiously named

16 respondents are also responsible for the actions described in this Petition. When the true identities

17 and capacities of these respondents have been determined, Petitioners will amend this petition, with

18 leave of the Court if necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.

19 15. Petitioners are informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Real Party

20 County of San Luis Obispo is a political subdivision of the State of California. Petitioners are

21 informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that the County regulates coastal development

22 activities within its jurisdiction pursuant to an LCP certified by the Commission on October 7,

23 1986. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that the County's certified LCP

24 assumes, allows, and incorporates OHV use at the ODSVRA. Petitioners are informed and believe,

25 and on that basis allege, that the Commission's amendment to CDP 4-82-300 requiring the complete

26 elimination of OHV use at the ODSVRA by 2024 is inconsistent with the County's certified LCP.

27 16. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Party Does 1

28 through 10 and sue such real parties by fictitious names. Petitioners are informed and believe, and

6
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

on that basis allege, that the fictitiously named real parties are directly and materially affected by

2 the actions described in this Petition. When the true identities and capacities of these real parties

3 have been determined, Petitioners will amend this petition, with leave of the Court if necessary, to

4 insert such identities and capacities.

5 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

6 17. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 527, 1085, 1087, and 1094.5,

7 Public Resources Code section 21080.5, 21168, 21168.5, 21168.9, 30801, the San Luis Obispo

8 County Superior Court has initial jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set aside the

9 Commission's decision to amend CDP 4-82-300 and, through that amendment, require State Parks

10 to phase out OHV use at the ODSVRA by 2024.

11 18. The subject of this action, the ODSVRA, is located in San Luis Obispo County.

12 Therefore, venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California in and

13 for the County of San Luis Obispo pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394,

14 19. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to filing this action and have

15 exhausted all available administrative remedies to the extent possible and required by law.

16 Petitioners submitted comments to the Commission objecting to the proposed amendments to CDP

17 4-82-300 requiring the phase-out of OHV use at the ODSVRA. EcoLogic also provided testimony

18 during the Commission hearing of March 18, 2021, reiterating its objections to the proposed action

19 and amendments to the CDP.

20 20. On April 15, 2021, Petitioners complied with Public Resources Code section

21 21167.5 by emailing and mailing to Respondents (the Commission and State Parks) letters stating

22 that Petitioners planned to file a Petition for Writ of Mandate seeking to invalidate the

23 Commission's amendment of CDP 4-82-300. Attached hereto as Exhibit A are true and correct

24 copies of those letters.

25 21. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6(b)(2), Petitioners elect to prepare

26 the record of proceedings in this action. Concurrently with this Petition, Petitioners will file with

27 this court a notice of election to prepare the administrative record.

28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

22. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in law unless this Court grants

2 the requested writ of mandate and orders the Commission to set aside its amendments to CDP 4-82-

3 300. In the absence of such remedies, the Commission's amendments to CDP-4-82-300, and State

4 Parks' acceptance and implementation of those amendments, will remain in violation of State law,

5 and Petitioners and their members will be irreparably harmed. No money damages or other legal

6 remedy will adequately compensate Petitioners and their members for that harm.

7 23. This petition is timely filed.

8 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

9 24. Pismo State Beach ("PSB") and the Oceano Dunes State Vehicle Recreation Area

10 (ODSVRA) are park units owned and managed by State Parks. They are located on the Central

11 California coast in southern San Luis Obispo County. The City of Pismo Beach is to the north and

12 the City of Grover Beach and the unincorporated community of Oceano are to the east. The

13 ODSVRA borders PSB to the south. The Phillips 66 refinery and privately-owned agricultural land

14 abut the ODSVRA to the east, and the Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes National Wildlife Refuge is to the

15 south. This lawsuit addresses the ODSVRA only, not PSB.

16 25. The ODSVRA was established in 1974, when the State of California acquired the

17 park's initial 847 acres from Pacific Gas & Electric as a designated OHV recreation area. At that

18 time, the park was known as the "Pismo Dunes State Vehicle Recreation Park". The Coastal Act

19 did not become effective until three years later, in 1977.

20 26. In 1982, the state legislature adopted the Off-Highway Motor Vehicle Act (the

21 "OHV Act", which established numerous state vehicle recreation areas and set forth the process for

22 establishing additional SVRAs in the future. (Pub.Res.Code §§ 5090 et seq.) Among the SVRAs

23 specifically referenced in the 1982 OHV Act was the Pismo Dunes SVRA, which was later named

24 the "Occano Dunes State Vehicle Recreation Area" in 1994. Land acquisitions between 1974 and

25 1994 expanded the size of the ODSVRA. Currently, the SVRA comprises 3,490 acres, including

26 584 acres leased from the County of San Luis Obispo, known as the "La Grande Tract". It also

27 includes 371 acres owned by Union Oil and Phillips 66, which State Parks has leased and operated

28 as part of the ODSVRA since 1981.

8
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 27. In 1994, State Parks changed the name of the SVRA from "Pismo Dunes State

2 Vehicle Recreation Area" to "Oceano Dunes State Vehicle Recreation Area".

3 28. Both OHVs and street-legal vehicles are allowed in the open riding areas of the

4 ODSVRA, which consists of approximately 3.5 miles of beach and approximately 1,350 acres of

5 dunes. Outside of these areas, OHV and vehicle use is prohibited. Thus, nearly 2,100 acres or

6 almost two-thirds of the SVRA are protected from impacts associated with vehicle use.

7 29. The State of California selected Oceano Dunes as a site for an OHV recreation area

8 because residents and visitors have been enjoying motorized recreation at Oceano Dunes for in part

9 approximately 100 years. By establishing an SVRA at Oceano Dunes, State Parks was able to

10 regulate and manage long-standing motorized recreation at this location, thereby ensuring that this

11 existing use could continue for many generations to come.

12 30. In 1982, State Parks proposed the construction of entrance kiosks at ODSVRA, as

13 well as placement of fencing along portions of the park's perimeter and around certain areas

14 deemed biologically sensitive, such as wetlands. These proposed improvements to the ODSVRA

15 constituted "development" as that term is defined under the Coastal Act. For that reason, State Parks

16 applied to the Commission for a Coastal Development Permit (CDP). State Parks could have

17 applied to the County of San Luis Obispo for the CDP, but at that point in time, the County's LCP

18 had not yet been certified by the Commission. Therefore, State Parks needed to obtain its requested

19 CDP directly from the Commission. On June 17, 1982, the Commission approved CDP 4-82-300 to

20 allow State Parks to construct the entrance kiosks and the protective fencing. The permit, including

21 four subsequent amendments, addressed the number of users to be allowed in the ODSVRA. It also

22 required State Parks, in consultation with the County of San Luis Obispo and Commission staff, to

23 a prepare a "carrying capacity" study to guide future management of the ODSVRA.

24 31. On October 7, 1986, the Commission certified the San Luis Obispo County LCP.

25 That LCP incorporated, assumed, and allowed OHV use at the ODSVRA, consistent with CDP 4-

26 82-300.

27 32. In the last 25 years, the ODSVRA has become one of the most popular destinations

28 for Californians and visitors from other states who enjoy motorized recreation, in part because the

9
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

A

2 ODSVRA is the only place in California where OHVs and other vehicles, including motorhomes,

3 are allowed on the beach. The ODSVRA's large dune complex is also a major attraction.
33.

4 During that same 25-year period, State Parks has made a variety of changes to the
ODSVRA to better protect

5 the site's natural resources. These changes have reduced the acreage

6 designated for RV camping and OHV riding, while increasing the acreage designated for resource

7 conservation. State Parks has also worked closely with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service

8 (USFWS) and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW") to establish "exclosures"
the protect the federally-listed snowy plover and California least tern.

9 34.

10 Despite State Parks' conservation efforts at the ODSVRA, some environmental

11 organizations, and the Commission itself, have expressed concerns regarding OHV use at the park.
More recently, various groups

12 have called for the Commission to rescind CDP 4-82-300 and

13 eliminate OHV use at ODSVRA, citing impacts to air quality, special status birds and fish,
environmentally sensitive habitat areas, and cultural resources.

14 35. In or about 2017, the Commission recommended that State Parks prepare a Public

15 Works Plan ("PWP") for the ODSVRA

16 pursuant to Public Resources Code section 30605. The

17 PWP would purportedly allow State Parks to adjust its management of the park, as well as complete

18 certain development projects, with a more streamlined review process. The PWP would also allow

19 State Parks to address some of the ongoing resource protection concerns raised by environmental

20 groups, local residents, regulatory agencies, and the Commission, Between 2017 and December

21 2020, State Parks developed the PWP and prepared a Draft Environmental Impact Report for it.

22 During that period, State Parks also worked with USFWS and CDFW to develop a Habitat
Conservation Plan and a Biodiversity Management Plan for the ODSVRA.

23 36.

24 In May 2018, State Parks and the San Luis Obispo County Air Pollution Control

25 District entered into a Stipulated Order of Abatement ("SOA") related to dust emissions at

26 ODSVRA, However, studies conducted since May 2018 have raised doubts as to air quality data on

27 which the SOA was based. Those same studies bring into question whether the perceived dust

28 problem is related to OHV use at the ODSVRA or is instead a natural phenomenon caused by
strong winds off the Pacific Ocean. Nevertheless, despite the uncertainties surrounding the dust

10
VERIFIED FIRST ÁMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 issue - often referred to as "particulate matter" in air quality parlance - State Parks has prepared a

3 Particular Matter Reduction Plan to address dust impacts identified in the SAO.

37.

4 In December 2020, State Parks released for public and agency review the Draft PWP

5 and Draft EIR. Petitioner EcoLogic submitted comments on both. The Draft PWP proposes

6 numerous changes at ODSVRA but retained the park's commitment to motorized recreation. At the

7 insistence of the Commission, however, the PWP's Draft EIR included an alternative that would
phase out OHV use at ODSVRA in five years.

8 38.

9 The public comment period on the draft PWP and Draft EIR was set to conclude on
April 16, 2021.

10 39.

11 On information and belief, Petitioners allege that on or about March 1, 2021, the

12 Commission issued a public notice for a Special Meeting regarding the ODSVRA, to be held on

13 March 18, 2018. The notice indicated that the Commission, at the Special Meeting, would be

14 considering amendments to CDP 4-82-300. The notice, however, did not explicitly state that

15 Commission staff was recommending the Commission effectively rescind CDP 4-82-300 by

16 demanding that State Parks quickly phase out OHV use at the ODSVRA. This fact became clear

17 only when one reviewed the Commission staff report. The Commission website admonished

18 persons wishing to comment on the proposed amendment to keep their statements to three (3)

pages.

19 40.

20 On March 18, 2021, the Commission held the Special Meeting on the proposed

21 amendments to CDP 4-82-300. Petitioners and other members of the public submitted comments

22 and provided testimony prior to and during the hearing, which lasted more than 10 hours. At the

23 hearing, Commission staff stated that the "applicant" for the amendments to the CDP was State

24 Parks. However, State Parks expressly objected to Commission staff's recommendation that OHV

25 use at ODSVRA be phased out. Thus, it appears that the Commission, not State Parks, was the

26 "sponsor" of the so-called amendment to CDP 4-82-300. Following the close of public comment,

27 the Commission closed the public hearing and voted unanimously to "amend" CDP 4-82-300 to

28 a require a full phase out of OHV use at ODSVRA within three (3) years.

11
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 41. The Staff Report prepared for the proposed amendment to CDP 4-82-300 did not

2 identify itself as an environmental impact study; nor did it attempt to evaluate the environmental

3 effects of the proposed amendment. The Staff Report also did not discuss mitigation measures or

4 alternatives that would have reduced the amendment's potentially significant impacts, such as those

5 on recreation, coastal access, LCP consistency, historic resources, and physical blight caused by

0 economic losses from the phase out of OHV use. The Staff Report also made no attempt to respond

7 to comments previously submitted by members of the public or by state and local agencies. No

8 other document issued by the Commission addressed these issues either.

9 42. Because the Commission's amendment to CDP 4-82-300 calls for the rapid phasing

10 out of OHV use at ODSVRA, it rendered the entire PWP process, on which State Parks has spent

11 hundreds of thousands of dollars, moot and meaningless.

12 43. As of April 12, 2021, the Commission had not yet notified the California Resources

13 Agency of its March 18, 2021 decision to amend CDP 4-82-300, as required by Public Resources

14 Code section 21080.5(d)(2)(E).

15 44. In an abundance of caution, EcoLogic filed this lawsuit within 30 days of the

16 Commission's action on March 18, 2021.

17 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

18 Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub.Res.Code §§ 21000)

19 Against California Coastal Commission

20 45. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by this reference allegations 1 through 44, above,

21 as if fully set forth herein.

22 46. Like all state and local agencies in California, the Commission must comply with the

23 California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) when taking action on a "project" as that term is

24 defined in the statute. (Pub.Res.Code, §§ 21000 et seq.) CEQA requires that the acting or "lead"

25 agency assess and publicly disclose a project's potential to cause significant environmental impacts.

26 CEQA also requires the lead agency to accept and respond to public comments regarding the project

27 and its impacts. And, finally, CEQA requires the lead agency to examine project alternatives and

28

12
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 mitigation measures that will reduce the project's significant effects, if such alternatives and
mitigation measures are feasible.

47. Approval or amendment of a

4 Coastal Development Permit is a project under CEQA.

5 Thus, the Commission's proposed amendments to CDP 4-82-300 constituted a project and required a
CEQA review.

6 48. Though the Commission must comply with CEQA, it may do SO pursuant to a
"regulatory program" that differs slightly but not substantially from the basic procedural and

9 substantive requirements of the statute and the CEQA Guidelines. (Pub.Res.Code, § 21080.5.) Such

10 regulatory programs must be approved by the Resources Agency and shall, at a minimum, do all of
the following:

11

12 Require that an activity will not be approved or adopted as proposed if there

13 are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available that would

14 substantially lessen a significant adverse effect that the activity may have on
the environment.

15

16 Include guidelines for the orderly evaluation of proposed activities and the

17 preparation of the plan or other written documentation in a manner consistent

18 with the environmental protection purposes of the regulatory program.

19 Require the administering agency to consult with all public agencies that

20 have jurisdiction, by law, with respect to the proposed activity.

21 Require that final action on the proposed activity include the written

22 responses of the issuing authority to significant environmental points raised
during the evaluation process.

23

24 Require the filing of a notice of the decision by the administering agency on

25 the proposed activity with the Secretary of the Resources Agency. Those

26 notices shall be available for public inspection, and a list of the notices shall a

27 be posted on a weekly basis in the Office of the Resources Agency. Each list

28 shall remain posted for a period of 30 days.

13
VERIPIED FIRST ÁMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Require notice of the filing of the plan or other written documentation to be

2 made to the public and to a person who requests, in writing, notification. The
notification shall be made in a manner that will provide the public or the

4 person requesting notification with sufficient time to review and comment on

5 the filing. (Pub.Res.Code § 21080.5(d)(2).)

6 49. Rather than an EIR, the Commission, through this alternative regulatory program,

7 may present its environmental impact analysis is "plan or other written documentation". The plan

8 or other written documentation, however, must do both of the following:

9 Include a description of the proposed activity with alternatives to the activity,

10 and mitigation measures to minimize any significant adverse effect on the

11 environment of the activity.

12 Be made available for a reasonable time for review and comment by other

13 public agencies and the general public. (Pub.Res.Code § 21080.5(d)(3).)

14 50. The Commission's website does not include or otherwise provide access to its

15 approved regulatory program.

16 51. When it issued the public notice for the Special Meeting regarding the ODSVRA and

17 CDP 4-82-300, the Commission did not identify any "plan or other written documentation" that was

18 to serve as the Commission's compliance document under Public Resources Code section 21080.5.

19 The Commission did post and make available to the public the Commission's staff report. The staff

20 report, however, did not state that it was being used to satisfy the Commission's obligations under

21 Public Resources Code section 21080.5.

22 52. In addition, the staff report did not evaluate the potentially significant impacts of the

23 proposed amendments to CDP 4-82-300, which include reduced recreational opportunities, reduced

24 coastal access, elimination of historical/cultural uses, physical blight due to adverse economic

25 effects, and inconsistency with local land use plans. Nor did it describe alternatives to the proposed

26 amendments or discuss mitigation measures that might reduce the impacts of those amendments.

27 The staff report also did not provide responses to comments submitted by other agencies or

28 members of the public. Thus, neither the staff report nor any other document prepared and issued by

14
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

the Commission met the minimum requirements of Public Resources Code section 21080.5. Thus,

2 the Commission failed to comply with CEQA when it amended CDP 4-82-300.

3 53. To the extent the Commission believes it did, in fact, comply with CEQA, its

4 findings and conclusions regarding the environmental effects of the proposed amendments to CDP

5 4-82-300 are not supported by substantial evidence.

6 54. State law, including Public Resources Code section 21167.6(e), requires the

7 Commission to retain all records necessary to form the complete administrative record of

8 proceedings in an action to challenge the Commission's amendment of CDP 4-82-300.

9 55. On information and belief, Petitioners hereby allege that the Commission has deleted

10 or destroyed records relating to the amendment of CDP 4-82-300 and any environmental review

11 thereof, and that such destroyed records were required to be retained for inclusion in the

12 administrative record for this action.

13 56. The Commission improperly truncated public participation in the environmental

14 review process by admonishing interested persons to limit their comments to three pages.

15 57. For the foregoing reasons, the Commission abused its discretion when it adopted the

16 amendments to CDP 4-82-300 without first complying with CEQA.

17 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

18 Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub.Res Code §§ 21000, et seq)

19 Against State Parks

20 58. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by this reference allegations through 57, above,

21 as if fully set forth herein.

22 59. State Parks, like the Commission, must comply with CEQA when it acts on a

23 proposed project that has the potential to result in significant impacts on the environment. Unlike

24 the Commission, State Parks has no approved "regulatory program" under Public Resources Code

25 section 21080.5. Thus, State Parks must comply with the various procedural and analytical

26 requirements set forth in the CEQA statute and the CEQA Guidelines.

27 60. During the March 18, 2021 Commission hearing on the proposed amendments to

28 CDP, Commission staff indicated that State Parks was the project "applicant". If this is true, State

15
VERIFIED FIRST ÂMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Parks was required to prepare a CEQA-compliant document that evaluated the extent to which the

2 proposed amendments to CDP 4-82-300 would result in significant impacts on the environment.

3 State Parks prepared no such document.

4 61. Concurrently with the Commission's proposed amendments to CDP 4-82-300, State

5 Parks was and is preparing a Public Works Plan (PWP) for the ODSVRA, as requested by the

6 Commission. In December 2020, State Parks released the draft PWP and its attendant Draft EIR to

7 the public and relevant state and local agencies. The draft PWP and Draft EIR included an

8 alternative that called for the OHV use at the ODSVRA to be phased out over a period of five (5)

9 years.

10 62. The public comment period on the PWP and Draft EIR was set to close on April 16,
11 2021, at which point State Parks would begin finalizing both the PWP and the EIR. Thus, at this
12 time, State Parks has not yet finished its CEQA review of the PWP. However, to the extent State

13 Parks sought to bypass the CEQA process on the PWP and use the CDP amendment process to

14 phase out OHV use at the ODSVRA, State Parks abused its discretion and violated CEQA.

15 63. State law, including Public Resources Code section 21167.6(e), requires State Parks
16 to retain all records necessary to form the complete administrative record of proceedings in an
17 action to challenge the Commission's amendment of CDP 4-82-300.

18 64. On information and belief, Petitioners hereby allege that State Parks has deleted or

19 destroyed records relating to the amendment of CDP 4-82-300 and any environmental review

20 thereof, and that such destroyed records were required to be retained for inclusion in the
21 administrative record for this action.

22 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

23 Violations of the California Coastal Act (Public Resources Code Section 30000 et seq):

24 Against California Coastal Commission

25 65. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by this reference allegations 1 through 64, above,

26 as if fully set forth herein.

27 66. The State of California established the ODSVRA (originally knowns as the "Pismo

28 Dunes State Vehicle Recreation Area") in 1974, approximately three years prior to enactment of the

16
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 California Coastal Act, which was passed in 1976 and became effective January 1, 1977. Thus, the

2 ODSVRA was an existing use at the time the Coastal Act became law.

3 67. Between 1974 and January 1, 1977 (the effective date of the Coastal Act), the

4 ODSVRA operated as a unit within the California State Parks system.

5 68. Between January 1, 1977 and 1982, State Parks operated the ODSVRA without need

6 of a Coastal Development Permit, because, during that period, State Parks did not propose or

7 attempt to implement any "development" requiring such a permit. a

8 69. In 1982, the California Legislature passed the 1982 Off-Highway Vehicle Act,

9 which, among other things, provided procedures and funding mechanisms for establishing state-

10 sponsored OHV parks in California. The 1982 Off-Highway Vehicle Act also expressly recognized

11 several then-existing State Vehicle Recreation Areas. Among those identified by name was the

12 Pismo Dunes State Vehicle Recreation Area, now known as the ODSVRA.

13 70. Also in 1982, State Parks applied to the Commission for its first Coastal

14 Development Permit (CDP). The CDP was to cover construction of entry kiosks and installation of

15 protective fencing around certain resource areas. The CDP did not seek permission from the

16 Commission to operate the ODSVRA or allow OHV use at the park. That issue had already been

17 decided in 1974, when the State of California established the ODSVRA and allowed OHV use

18 within its a boundaries - a decision later confirmed by the 1982 Off-Highway Vehicle Act.

19 71. When the Commission approved CDP 4-82-300, it recognized and accepted that the

20 ODSVRA was an existing use that allowed OHV recreation within its boundaries. Nothing in CDP

21 4-82-300 lawfully give the Commission the right or authority to eliminate OHV use at the

22 ODSVRA or to order State Parks to do the same.

23 72. On March 18, 2021, the Commission amended CDP 4-82-300 to mandate that OHV

24 use at the ODSVRA be phased out within three years and that the park be converted to a non-

25 motorized unit within the State Parks system. The Commission's amendments, and the mandates

26 they carry, are beyond the Commission's legal authority and thus ultra vires. The Commission,

27 which is an unelected body, has no power under the Coastal Act to eliminate a State-created,
28 legislatively-confirmed state vehicle recreation area such as the ODSVRA. In amending CDP 4-82-

17
VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 300 to eliminate, or direct State Parks to eliminate, OHV use at the ODSVRA, the Commission

3 violated the Coastal Act and committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

73.

4 The Commission made no finding that State Parks, in its management and operation

5 of the ODSVRA, is in violation of CDP 4-82-300 or any applicable provision of the Coastal Act. To

6 the extent the Commission believes it made such a finding, the finding is not supported by

7 substantial evidence in the record. Thus, to the extent the Commission amended CDP 4-82-300 on

8 grounds that State Parks was in violation of its terms or in violation of other applicable provisions
of the Coastal Act, the amendments are not supported by substantial evidence; thus the
9 Commissions adoption of those amendments constitutes prejudicial abuse of discretion.

10 74.

11 The Commission's amendments to CDP 4-82-300 are inconsistent with the County

12 of San Luis Obispo's certified Local Coastal Program (LCP), which assumes and allows OHV use

at the ODSVRA. Such inconsistency is not permitted under the Coastal Act. Thus, the
13 Commission's amendments to CDP 4-82-300 violate the law and represent a prejudicial abuse of a

14 discretion.

15 75.

16 The Commission improperly truncated public participation in the Coastal Act

17 review process by admonishing interested persons to limit their comments to three pages.

76.

18 For the reasons set forth above, in amending CDP 4-82-300 to require the phase out

19 of OHV use at the ODSVRA, the Commission failed to proceed in the manner required by law, thus
resulting in a prejudicial abuse of discretion.
