1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges approvals by Respondent City of Riverside ("City" or

3 "Respondent") of the Northside Specific Plan ("Project") and the related approval of an Environmental
Impact Report ("EIR").

5 2. The City violated the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code
21000, et seq., in several respects. Among other things, the City failed to adequately consider the

7 environmental impacts associated with the Project, failed to prepare and circulate required

8 environmental analysis, and failed to consider feasible alternatives and mitigation.
3. Petitioner seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate declaring the City's approvals
1.0 invalid, and enjoining the City from taking steps to implement the approvals.

11 PARTIES

12 4. Petitioner Friends of Riverside's Hills (Petitioner") is a non-profit corporation based in the

13 City of Riverside, with members who are residents of the City of Riverside. Petitioner seeks to protect

14 the environment and natural resources of the Riverside area. Petitioner and its members have been

15 injured as a result of Respondent's actions. Petitioner and its members use, enjoy, and benefit from the

16 resources affected by Respondent's actions. Respondent's actions adversely affect the recreational,

17 aesthetic, scientific, environmental, and economic interests of Petitioner and of Petitioner's members. The

18 interests of Petitioner and Petitioner's members have been and will continue to be adversely affected by

19 Respondent's unlawful actions. The relief sought in this Petition would redress Petitioner's and

20 Petitioner's members' injuries.

21 5. Respondent City of Riverside ("City") is a political subdivision of the State of California and

22 the County of Riverside and a body corporate and politic exercising local government powers, as specified

23 by the Constitution and the laws of the State of California.

24 6. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities of the persons or entities sued herein as

25 Does 1 through 5, and therefore sue these respondents by such fictitious names. Petitioner will amend the

26 Petition to set forth the names and capacities of said respondents along with appropriate charging

27 allegations when the same have been ascertained.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY

2 7. The approximately 2,000-acre Northside Specific Plan area is located on the border
between the County of San Bernardino and County of Riverside. It includes approximately 1,600 acres
within the City of Riverside, approximately 336 acres within the City of Colton, and approximately 83

5 acres within the unincorporated County of Riverside. Within the City of Colton, the area includes the

6 227-acre Pellissier Ranch, which is owned by Riverside Public Utilities.

7 8. The area is southwest of La Loma Hills, north of downtown Riverside, west of Hunter

8 Industrial Park, and east of the Santa Ana River.

9. It includes a variety of uses, including residential, commercial, office, and industrial uses,

10 as well as the former Riverside Golf Course. It also includes open space and important biological

11 habitat.

12 10. As a part of the Project, and to accommodate the adoption of the Northside Specific Plan,

13 the City proposed to amend its General Plan, adopt the Specific Plan, adopt zoning code amendments,

14 and rezone affected properties.

15 11. The Specific Plan would provide for several land uses in the area. It also includes a

16 "Transition Zone Overlay," which would allow certain uses to remain over time. Under "Scenario 13

17 of the Specific Plan, near-term buildout would include an additional 5,383 residential units and

18 5,227,000 square feet of employment-based uses and year 2040 buildout would include 12,681

19 residential units and 15,567,000 square feet of employment-based uses.

20 12. The City prepared a Program Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") regarding the Project.

21 The City provided a comment period on the draft EIR from approximately March 26 to May 25, 2020.

22 13. On September 3, 2020, the City's Planning Commission held a hearing regarding the

23 Project and EIR.

24 14. After receiving public testimony, the Planning Commission voted to recommend approval

25 of the Project and EIR.

26 15. A final EIR was issued on or about November 17, 2020. The EIR acknowledged significant

27 impacts to aesthetics, air quality, biological resources, cultural resources, geology and soils, hazards

28

Friends of Riverside's Hills v. City of Riverside Page 3
Writ Petition

and hazardous materials, hydrology and water quality, land use and planning, noise, transportation, and

2 tribal cultural resources. The EIR claimed significant impacts were unavoidable.
16. After receiving testimony, and despite numerous expressed concerns, the City Council

4 voted to approve the Project and EIR. Approvals included the approval of P19-0064 General Plan
Amendment, P19-0065 Specific Plan, P19-0063 Zoning Code Amendment, P20-0443 Rezoning, and

6 P19-0066 Program Environmental Impact Report.
17. A Notice of Determination was filed by the City on November 24, 2020.

8 18. On December 1, 2020 the City Council held a hearing regarding the zoning approvals for
the Project. Comments were received in writing in opposition to the Project from Petitioner's

10 representatives.

11 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

12 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

13 19. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies, and objections to the Project

14 have been presented orally and in writing to the City, as required by Public Resources Code Section

15 21177. These include, but are not limited to, letters and oral comments presented during public

16 hearings.

17 20. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5

18 by mailing a written notice of commencement of this action to the City. A true and correct copy of

19 is that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

20 21. Petitioner has advised the City that Petitioner has elected to prepare the record of

21 proceedings relevant to the approval of the Project, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section

22 21167.6. A true and correct copy of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.

23 22. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code Section 21167.7 by filing copy of

24 the original petition with the California Attorney General. A true and correct copy of the notification

25 is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.

26 23. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law unless the Court grants the requested writ of

27 mandate requiring the City to set aside its approval of the Project and the EIR. In the absence of such

28

Friends of Riverside's Hills v. City of Riverside Page
Writ Petition

remedy, the City's approvals will remain in effect in violation of State law, and Petitioner will suffer

2 irreparable harm because of the significant adverse environmental impacts generated by the Project.
