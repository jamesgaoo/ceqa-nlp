VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

Petitioners and Plaintiffs West Coast Chapter, Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, Inc.

2 (*ISRI"), Ecology Recycling Services, LLC ("Ecology"), SA Recycling, LLC ("SA Recycling"),

3 Schnitzer Steel Industries, Inc. ("Schnitzer Steel"), Sims Group USA Corporation ("Sims"), and

4 Universal Service Recycling, Inc. ("USR") (collectively, "Petitioners") hereby petition this Court

5 for a writ of mandate and complain for declaratory and injunctive relief ("Petition") against

6 Respondents and Defendants California Department of Toxic Substances Control ("DTSC") and

7 Meredith Williams, in her capacity as Director of DTSC (collectively, "DTSC," or

8 "Respondents"), and by this Petition allege as follows:

9 INTRODUCTION

10 1. Petitioners seek to set aside emergency regulations adopted by DTSC and

11 approved by the Office of Administrative Law ("OAL") on October 25, 2021, that modify the

12 state definition of "scrap metal" set forth in Title 22, California Code of Regulations, Sections

13 66260.10 and 66273.9. DTSC Reference No. R-2021-11E (hereafter, the "Emergency

14 Regulations" or "Regulations"). Through this single definitional change, adopted under the guise

15 of an "emergency" and described as a mere "clarification," Respondents seek unlawfully to

16 impose an unprecedented and unworkable regulatory regime on the scrap metal recycling

17 (shredding) facilities operated by Petitioners. To be clear, there is no emergency. The facts

18 upon which Respondents' make their Finding of Emergency have been known to DTSC for years,

19 have not previously been considered necessary for urgent response, and do not now create the

20 necessary risk of harm to human health, safety or the environment to justify the Emergency

21 Regulations. Respondents' precipitous and unlawful action deprives Petitioners of their basic

22 rights under due process of law and immediately threatens the viability of Petitioners' business

23 operations that comprise a critical sector of the state's recycling infrastructure.

24 2. The Emergency Regulations were adopted in violation of OAL standards
25 establishing Special Requirements for Submission of Emergency Regulatory Actions (1 Cal.

26 Code Regs. § 50), the California Administrative Procedures Act ("APA") (Gov. Code §§ 11340 et

27 seq.), the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000 et seq.),

28 and other provisions of California law, including those relating to scientific peer review and to
- 2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

preparation of a Standardized Regulatory Impact Assessment for major regulations, i.e., those

2 with an estimated economic impact exceeding $50 million.

3 3. Petitioners further seek to set aside DTSC's unilateral recission of DTSC Official

4 Policy/Procedures # 88-6 ("OPP #88-6") immediately following OAL's approval of the

5 Emergency Regulations. This policy-which is directly applicable to Petitioners' operations and

6 confirms the status of "metal shredder aggregate" as an in-process material, and not a

7 "waste"-has had the force and effect of law for over three decades. Respondents' unilateral

8 recission of this policy is in violation of the APA. For the reasons alleged herein, DTSC failed to

9 proceed in the manner required by law and abused its discretion, all to the immediate detriment of

10 the Petitioners, and threatening the viability of a necessary business in California.

11 4. Petitioners own and operate the seven largest metal shredding facilities in

12 California and provide for the safe, environmentally responsible, and efficient recycling of the

13 millions of tons of scrap metal produced in the state every year. This scrap metal is purchased by

14 Petitioners for use as raw material in their operations and is conceded by Respondents to be

15 exempt from regulation under the Hazardous. Waste Control Law. Health & Safety Code

16 § 25100, et seq. These facilities use hammer mill shredders and other advanced equipment to

17 separate out and prepare specification-grade ferrous (steel) and non-ferrous (aluminum, copper,

18 etc.) metals for use as feedstock in steel mills and smelters in the United States and other

19 countries around the world, making these valuable commodities commercially available for

20 beneficial use, conserving natural resources, saving energy, and reducing greenhouse gas

21 emissions.

22 5. Since the advent of the hazardous waste management program in the early 1980's,

23 scrap metal recycling operations-including metal shredding and the subsequent processing steps

24 that separate, sort and remove valuable ferrous and non-ferrous metals from the shredded

25 material-have been exempt from regulation under the HWCL. After nearly 40 years, this

26 regulatory paradigm has been upended by Respondents who now claim that these valuable scrap

27 metals are no longer "scrap metal" once they have been prepared for recycling, i.e., by being

28 shredded by the hammer mill. According to Respondents, shredded scrap metal ("metal shredder
-3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

aggregate" in the parlance of the Emergency Regulations)' becomes "waste" by virtue of the

2 mechanical process that is used to render the metals available for recovery and beneficial use. It

3 defies logic and common sense to classify this material as "waste."

4 6. Under current law, scrap metal that is "being recycled" is exempt from state

5 hazardous waste regulations. See 22 Cal. Code Regs., § 66261.6(a)(3). This provision was not

6 amended by the Emergency Regulations. The act of shredding scrap metal (the first step in the

7 recycling process) necessarily produces "scrap metal being recycled," a material that is expressly

8 exempt from regulation under the HWCL. Metal shredder aggregate is nothing more than scrap

9 metal that has been reduced in size (shredded) so that it can undergo the processing steps needed

10 for recovery of ferrous and non-ferrous metal commodities. In other words, metal shredder

11 aggregate is scrap metal "being recycled," and is not a waste. a The Emergency Regulations

12 impermissibly seek to extend DTSC's authority over metal processing (recycling) operations at

13 metal shredding facilities by arbitrarily excluding "metal shredder aggregate" from the definition

14 of "scrap meta!" and labeling it a hazardous waste.

15 7. Over the past 10 years, Petitioners have been engaged with Respondents in

16 prolonged and good-faith effort to develop an updated regulatory framework for California metal

17 shredding facilities to address certain concerns raised by DTSC. At no time over the entire course

18 of these regulatory development efforts has DTSC ever suggested that metal shredding facilities

19 pose "serious and imminent harm" to the public welfare. Now, out of the blue, Respondents

20 claim that metal shredding facilities have caused an unforeseen public health "emergency" that

21 can only be rectified by the immediate elimination of the scrap metal exemption and the

22 application of the HWCL to these recycling operations. Respondents' action is based on a legal

23 fiction and is not supported by substantial evidence.

24 8. Respondents claim that the Emergency Regulations merely "clarify" the definition

25 of "scrap metal" in the Title 22 regulations. This is incorrect. Respondents' true purpose in

26 adopting the Emergency Regulations is far more sweeping than a mere "clarification"-

27 "Metal shredder aggregate" is an industry term that refers exclusively to the in-process material
28 that is the source of the ferrous and non-ferrous commodities produced by metal shredding facilities. Respondents co-opt and misuse this term in the Emergency Regulations. -4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

Respondents seek to eliminate the scrap metal exemption that has applied to Petitioners' metal

2 processing operations since the early 1980's and subject these facilities to regulation as hazardous

3 waste treatment facilities under the HWCL. DTSC's rulemaking understates the far-reaching

4 effects of its action and the agency failed to disclose or analyze the serious adverse economic

5 consequences and environmental effects of this dramatic regulatory change.

6 9. DTSC further intends to use the Regulations for two improper purposes. First,

7 they seek to create new authority to regulate the scrap metals purchased by Petitioners. Because

8 this valuable commodity was acquired for value and was not discarded, it is not a waste and

9 subject to regulation under the HWCL. Nor, for that matter, is it hazardous. As such, DTSC has

10 no statutory authority to regulate Petitioners' metal processing activities. Second, as DTSC's

11 emergency findings accompanying the Regulations make clear, Respondents adopted the

12 Regulations for the purpose of gaining advantage in a pending lawsuit filed by Petitioners in

13 November 2019, which seeks to prevent DTSC from unlawfully regulating Petitioners' scrap

14 metal processing facilities as hazardous waste treatment facilities under current law.2 Through

15 this emergency rulemaking, Respondents seek an end-run around the judicial process to reverse

16 the long-standing regulatory scheme governing Petitioners' metal shredding operations in

17 California, without adequate justification of any purported "emergency" and outside the required
18 notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures of the APA.

19 10. Accordingly, Petitioners seek a judicial declaration that the Emergency

20 Regulations are invalid and an abuse of DTSC's discretion as no emergency exists and as an ultra

21 vires act contrary to the HWCL and implementing regulations, and a writ a of mandate directing

22 DTSC to rescind the Emergency Regulations and reinstate OPP #88-6. Petitioners also seek an

23 injunction to prevent DTSC from enforcing the Emergency Regulations against Petitioners. Such

24 an injunction is necessary to avoid the irreparable harm that would result if Petitioners' metal

25 processing operations were immediately and unlawfully reclassified as hazardous waste treatment

26 operations pursuant to the Emergency Regulations, rendering them immediately in violation of

27 See West Coast Chapter, Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, Inc., et al. v. California
28 Department of Toxic Substances Control, et al., Sacramento County Superior Court, Case No. 34-2019-00269900 ("2019 ISRI Action").

law and requiring discretionary authorization from DTSC to continue ongoing recycling and

2 storage operations.

3 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4 11. This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to the California

5 Constitution, Article VI, Section 10; Code of Civil Procedure Sections 525, 526, 1060 and 1085,

6 Government Code Section 11350; and Public Resources Code Sections 21080.5, 21168.5 and
7 21168.9.

8 12. Venue is proper in this Court because Respondents' illegal actions apply state-

9 wide and one of Petitioners' metal shredding facilities is located in Bakersfield, California.

10 Accordingly, the causes of action, or some part thereof, arose and have caused harm in Kern

11 County, and thus, venue is proper in this Court pursuant to section 393(b) of the California Code
12 of Civil Procedure.

13 13. Petitioners provided written notice of their intention to commence this action to

14 Respondents, in compliance with Public Resources Code Section 21167.5. A copy of that notice

15 and proof of service is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

16 14. Petitioners served the Attorney General with a copy of this Petition, along with a a

17 notice of its filing, in compliance with Public Resources Code Section 21167.7, a copy of which

18 is attached as Exhibit B to this Petition.

19 15. Concurrent with the filing of this Petition, Petitioners filed a notice requesting that

20 Respondent DTSC prepare the administrative record for this action, in accordance with Public

21 Resources Code Section 21167.6(a).

22 16. Petitioners satisfied all requirements to bring this action, including exhaustion of
23 administrative remedies and providing timely written comments to DTSC.

24 PARTIES

25 17. Petitioner West Coast Chapter, Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries, is a local

26 chapter of ISRI, a national, not-for-profit trade association that represents over 1,300 recycling

27 companies operating at more than 6,000 facilities in the United States (including in California),

28 and 40 countries worldwide. These members are engaged in the handling, processing, shipping
- 6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

and recycling of valuable scrap metal commodities. ISRI members pay dues and are actively

2 involved in the activities of the association, including this action. Petitioners Ecology, SA

3 Recycling, Schnitzer Steel, Sims and USR are each members of the West Coast Chapter of ISRI.

4 18. ISRI (and its chapters, including the West Coast Chapter), is a members-based

5 national trade association that is actively engaged with federal and state legislative and regulatory

6 matters affecting the scrap metal recycling industry. ISRI's members, including the individual
Petitioners in this action, are engaged in the handling, processing, shipping, and sale of valuable

8 recycled scrap metal commodities to customers around the world. Through its advocacy efforts,

9 and in order to promote commerce in recycled scrap metal, ISRI seeks to maintain consistency

10 among federal and state laws affecting scrap metal operations.

11 19. ISRI, through its West Coast Chapter, has associational standing to represent the

12 interests of its members in this action because ISRI's members would otherwise have standing to

13 sue in their own right; the interest ISRI seeks to protect in filing this lawsuit are germane to

14 ISRI's purpose; and the relief sought herein does not necessarily require the participation of

15 individual members in the lawsuit.

16 20. Ecology, SA Recycling, Schnitzer Steel, Sims and USR each own and operate

17 metal shredding and processing facilities in California. Their facilities include the seven largest

18 metal shredding facilities in the state of California and represent the bulk of the state's scrap

19 metal processing capacity and are essential to the safe and environmentally responsible recycling

20 of millions of valuable end-of-life vehicles, household appliances and other metal-containing

21 items.

22 21. Petitioner Ecology is privately-owned limited liability company organized under

23 the laws of the state of California and registered to do business in California. Ecology owns and

24 operates a metal shredding and processing facility in Colton, California, and is engaged in, and

25 intends to continue to engage in, the lawful operation of the facility.

26 22. Petitioner SA Recycling is a privately-owned limited liability company organized

27 under the laws of the state of Delaware and registered to do business in California. SA Recycling

28 owns and operates metal shredding and processing facilities in Los Angeles (Terminal Island),
-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

.

1 Anaheim, and Bakersfield, California, and is engaged in, and intends to continue to engage in, the

2 lawful operation of these facilities.

3 23. Petitioner Schnitzer Steel is a publicly traded company organized under the laws

4 of the state of Oregon and registered to do business in California. Schnitzer Steel owns and

5 operates metal shredding and processing facility in Oakland, California, and is engaged in, and

6 intends to continue to engage in, the lawful operation of the facility.

7 24. Petitioner Sims d/b/a Sims Metal is a subsidiary of a publicly traded company and

8 is organized under the laws of the state of Delaware and registered to do business in California.

9 Sims owns and a operates a metal shredding and processing facility in Redwood City, California,

10 and is engaged in, and intends to continue to engage in, the lawful operation of the facility.

11 25. Petitioner USR is a privately owned metal recycling company registered to do

12 business in California. USR owns and operates a metal shredding and processing facility in

13 Stockton, California, and is engaged in, and intends to continue to engage in, the lawful operation

14 of the facility. While smaller in volume than the other facilities involved in this action, USR's

15 metal recycling and processing operations are conducted in substantially the same manner as the

16 other Petitioners' operations.

17 26. The hazardous waste regulatory regime imposed on Petitioners' facilities by

18 Respondents' unlawful action will significantly disrupt their metal shredding and processing

19 operations, increase operating costs to the point their operations would likely be rendered

20 uneconomical, cause some or all of the facilities to be non-conforming land uses, and effectively

21 foreclose safe and cost-effective means of recycling the vast quantities of scrap metal generated

22 in California on a daily basis. Further, DTSC's actions stigmatize a legitimate industrial activity

23 and could impede the sale of valuable metals by characterizing them as the products of a

24 hazardous waste treatment process. Petitioners have an interest in the lawful and effective
25. regulation of metal shredding facilities and scrap metal recycling operations generally, and in the

26 continued economic viability of California's scrap metal recycling industry. This interest would

27 be frustrated, and the industry placed at serious risk, without a decision in Petitioners' favor in

28 this action.
- 8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

•

27. Petitioners participated in the rulemaking proceeding for the Emergency

2 Regulations (to the limited extent allowed), and in DTSC's efforts to analyze and evaluate the

3 regulatory framework for metal shredders over the past four years, contradicting any claim that

4 these matters are the subject of some "unforeseen emergency." Over this period of time,

5 Petitioners submitted numerous written and verbal comments to DTSC in an effort to explore

6 alternative ways in which the regulatory framework for metal shredding facilities might be

7 updated to address the agency's concerns. Specific to the Emergency Regulations, Petitioners

8 submitted their Comments of California Metal Recyclers Coalition to OAL on October 20, 2021

9 (discussed more specifically below). Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent

10 to filing this action and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent

11 required by law.

12 28. Respondent DTSC is an agency of the State of California, organized and existing

13 under and pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section 58000 et seq. DTSC is authorized to

14 administer and enforce the HWCL and its implementing regulations but may not do SsO in an

15 unlawful manner.

16 29. Respondent Meredith Williams is sued in her official capacity as the Director of

17 the Department of Toxic Substances Control. The Director serves as the chief executive of DTSC

18 and is ultimately responsible for the decisions made by DTSC concerning its implementation of

19 applicable laws and regulations. Ms. Williams was selected to serve as Acting Director of DTSC

20 by the California Secretary of Environmental Protection on January 9, 2019 and was confirmed as

21 the Director in August 2020.

22 30. DOES through 100, inclusive, are the partners, agents, employees or principals

23 of the named Respondents and Defendants and other State agencies, and of each other whose true

24 names and capacities are currently unknown to Petitioners; the named respondents and DOES

25 through 100, inclusive, performed the acts and conduct herein alleged, aided and abetted the
26 performance thereof, or knowingly acquiesced in, ratified, and accepted the benefits of such acts

27 and conduct; and therefore, DOES 1 through 100, inclusive, are liable to Petitioners and Plaintiffs

28 to the extent of the liability of the named Respondents and Defendants. Petitioners will seek

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

F leave of the Court to amend its Petition to reflect the true names and capacities of the

2 Respondents and Defendants designated herein as DOES when such identities and capacities

3 become known.

4 31. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that at all times

5 mentioned herein, each and every Respondent was acting as an agent and/or employee of each of

6 the other Respondents, and at all relevant times mentioned was acting within the course and scope

7 of said agency and/or employment with the full knowledge, permission, and consent of each of

8 the other Respondents. In addition, each of the acts and/or omissions of each Respondent alleged
9 herein were made known to, and ratified by, each of the other Respondents.

10 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

1I A. The Metal Shredding Industry and Petitioners' Operations.

12 32. Petitioners provide an essential service to California local municipalities, counties,

13 governmental agencies, businesses and individual residents: the safe and effective recycling of the

14 millions of tons of scrap metal that are produced in the state. Every year, the state of California

15 generates over 1.5 million end-of life vehicles and millions of tons of other types of scrap metal.

16 California law prohibits the disposal of recyclable scrap metal in California landfills, requiring

17 the state to support a viable scrap metal recycling industry to process these ubiquitous, valuable

18 materials. See Pub. Res. Code, §§ 42160 et seq. In fact, any salvageable metal that finds its way
19 a to a landfill is required to be diverted from disposal and redirected to a scrap metal recycling

20 facility for recycling. Id., § • 162. Salvaged scrap metal is not a "solid waste."

21 33. Petitioners conduct metal processing operations to separate, remove and collect

22 valuable ferrous and non-ferrous metals from end-of-life vehicles, household appliances and

23 myriad other forms of scrap metal. The shredding process reduces scrap metal to a size and form

24 from which ferrous and non-ferrous metals can be separated and removed from accompanying

25 non-metallic materials. Petitioners purchase the scrap metal that is processed by their facilities

26 from numerous sources including auto dismantlers, construction demolition companies,

27 manufacturers, and thousands of small, family-owned businesses that collect scrap metal. Upon

28 completion of processing, the metals are sold as commodities on the open market and are used in
- 10 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

the manufacture of steel and various metal alloys. Collectively, Petitioners' facilities shred

2 millions of tons of scrap metal on an annual basis, yielding over a million tons of ferrous and non-

3 ferrous metals from their metal processing operations. Indeed, DTSC has repeatedly recognized

4 the vital importance of the scrap metal industry to the state of California.3

5 34. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that approximately

6 8,100 people are directly employed in the scrap metal recycling industry in California. The direct

7 economic output of the scrap metal recycling industry in California is currently estimated at $2

8 billion annually, a significant percentage of which is attributable to Petitioners' metal shredding

9 facilities. When supplier and other induced impacts are taken into consideration, the economic

10 impact more than doubles to approximately $5.4 billion annually. The number of supplier and

11 induced jobs attributable to scrap metal recycling in California is estimated to exceed 17,000.

12 The shut-down or curtailment of metal shredding operations in the state would thus have

13 significant adverse effects throughout many sectors of the economy.

14 35. The recycling and beneficial use of scrap metal has significant environmental

15 benefits. It reduces the need to mine virgin ores, saves large amounts of energy, and provides
16 tangible benefits to public health, safety and the environment by ensuring that scrap metal is

17 managed safely and in an environmentally responsible manner. Petitioners' facilities also allow

18 the millions of tons of scrap metal that are produced annually in California to be managed in

19 California, without placing a burden on neighboring states.

20 36. The absence of viable metal recycling industry in the state would result in

21 significant adverse environmental consequences, irrespective of the financial impacts to

22 Petitioners. The 1.5 million or more vehicles that reach the end of their useful lives for

23 transportation each year in California would have to be shipped hundreds of miles to neighboring

24 states to be recycled or be shipped out of the country. Transport of these vehicles would place

25 thousands of additional trucks on the highways every year, increasing the risk of accidents, fossil

26 fuel usage, greenhouse gas and diesel particulate emissions, and costs/inconvenience to the

27

28 See, e.g., "Proposed Regulatory Path to Metal Shredder Compliance" (January 25, 2018), at p. (recognizing that the metal recycling sector "provides important services to Californians.") -11-

consumer. Inevitably, these vehicles and other scrap metals that would otherwise have been

2 purchased by Petitioners for recycling, will be abandoned in alleys, yards, vacant lots, or along

3 roadsides or improperly and dangerously loaded into shipping containers and sent overseas with

4 myriad unintended consequences. With the loss of available recycling outlets, routine collection

5 and recycling of household appliances and other forms of "light iron"4 would also be disrupted,

6 causing these materials to accumulate in huge quantities, creating urban and rural blight and

7 potential threats to human health, safety and the environment. Local governments will face

8 increased costs to address these risks and burdens.

9 37. If forced to operate under the state's hazardous waste permitting regime as a result

10 of DTSC's Emergency Regulations, many of Petitioners' facilities would be at serious risk of

11 discontinuing operations or being shut down for economic or other reasons.

12 B. Metal Shredding and Processing Operations.

13 38. Shredders are large electric hammer mills or similar devices that utilize a

14 shredding technique to reduce scrap metal to fist-sized pieces that can be processed by
15 | "downstream" separation equipment. The shredding process is strictly mechanical in nature and

16 does not involve the use or addition of heat or any hazardous materials. Purchased scrap metal

17 (shredder feedstock) is staged in stockpiles near the shredder and is placed onto an infeed

18 conveyor by a largè grapple attached to material handler equipment. The recyclable metal enters

19 the hammer mill where it is reduce in a size into a heterogeneous mixture of ferrous metal (i.e.,

20 steel), non-ferrous metals (e.g., copper and aluminum), and non-metallic materials that are

21 naturally present in the feedstock (e.g., upholstery, cloth, carpet, rubber, glass, and plastic). This

22 mixture, referred to as "shredder output" (or "metal shredder aggregate" in the Emergency

23 Regulations) exits the shredder and is conveyed to large rotating drum magnet that removes the

24 ferrous metal from this in-process material. The ferrous metal is conveyed to a stacking conveyor

25 from which it is placed into large stockpiles where it is stored pending sale.

26

27

28 4 "Light iron" is an industry term that applies to the myriad lighter forms of scrap metal that are processed by metal shredders. - 12 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

39. The mixture that remains after removal of ferrous metal is then moved by

2 a conveyor or other heavy equipment to a downstream non-ferrous metal separation plant where it

3 is processed by a variety of sophisticated, proprietary technologies that mechanically separate the

4 non-ferrous metals into range of different metal commodities, depending on the type, grade and

5 size of the metal. A substantial portion of the economic value in the scrap metal recycling

6 industry resides in the non-ferrous metals contained within this in-process material.

7 40. The in-process materials described above are the antithesis of "waste": the raw

8 materials entering the metal shredder are scrap metals that have not been discarded; these

9 materials are collected and sold for value to metal recyclers; the shredding process is a necessary

10 step to enable the recycling of these scrap metals; and the specification-grade metal products that

11 are produced by the recycling process are commodities. The fact that the non-metallic portion of

12 this in-process material is generated as waste at the end of the recycling process does not mean

13 that metal shredder aggregate is a waste at the beginning of or at any time during the separation

14 process. Indeed, almost every manufacturing process involves the use of raw materials, some

15 component of which ultimately ends up as waste at the end of the process. Here, the material that

16 remains after ferrous and non-ferrous metals have been removed (i.e., after completion of
17 | processing operations) is known as metal shredder residue and is a waste. For decades, DTSC

18 has taken the position that waste from the recycling process is not generated until after all metals

19 that can be removed from the aggregate have been removed. Only at that point is the material

20 considered "exhausted" and thus a waste. The Emergency Regulations turn that long-standing

21 paradigm on its head, placing Petitioners in the untenable position of having to comply overnight

22 with an entirely new set of highly prescriptive regulations that are ill-suited to, if not
23 incompatible, with their operations.
24 C. Statutory and Regulatory Framework.

25 41. DTSC's regulatory framework for metal shredding and recycling facilities over the

26 past 35 years has been based on three long-standing, fundamental principles: (1) DTSC has no

27 Metal shredder aggregate is not regulated as a hazardous waste in any other state, and is
28 expressly excluded from the federal definition of "solid waste" under RCRA. See 40 C.F.R. § 261.4(a)(13). - 13 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

jurisdiction under the HWCL over materials that are not "wastes" (Health & Saf. Code, § 25124);

2 (2) DTSC's recognition of and adherence to the scrap metal exemption contained in the HWCL

3 regulations and the application of that exemption during metal processing and recycling

4 operations (see 22 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 66260.10; 66261.6(a)(3)(B)); and (3) DTSC's own formal

5 determination that the materials being processed by metal shredding facilities are not subject to

6 regulation under the HWCL until after they have been "exhausted," i.e., after all ferrous and non-

7 ferrous metals that can be removed have been removed from the material produced by the

8 shredder. See OPP #88-6.6 This framework has sustained the industry since the advent of the

9 HWCL and has allowed metal shredding facilities to beneficially recycle over a hundred million

10 tons of metal in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner.

11 42. Under the HWCL, DTSC's jurisdiction is limited to "hazardous wastes." To be

12 considered a "hazardous waste," a material must in the first instance be defined as a "waste."

13 Section 25124(a) of the HWCL defines a "waste" as a "discarded material that is not excluded by

14 this chapter or by regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter." By law, materials that are not

15 "wastes" cannot be "hazardous waste" and therefore are not subject to regulation by DTSC,

16 regardless of their characteristics.

17 43. Neither the raw materials (scrap metals) that are introduced into the metal

18 shredder, nor the heterogeneous mixture that is produced by the metal shredding process to

19 facilitate the separation and removal of valuable ferrous and non-ferrous metal commodities, are

20 "discarded materials." The scrap metal feedstock is purchased by Petitioners through a network

21 of large and small suppliers, many of whom trade in these valuable materials. These materials are

22 collected, sorted, and sold to Petitioners for valuable consideration, and are prevented from

23 becoming part of the "rising tide" of waste that is addressed by the laws applicable to solid and

24 hazardous waste. See Waste Management of the Desert, Inc. v. Palm Springs Recycling Center,

25 Inc. (1994) 7 Cal. 4th 478.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

44. The fact that scrap metal items may not be suitable for their originally intended

2 purpose or have reached the end of their useful lives from the perspective of the original

3 purchaser or user does not mean they have been "discarded" under the HWCL. See West Coast

4 Chapter of the Institule of Scrap Recycling Industries v. Scott Smithline, et al. (Sac. County Sup.

5 Ct. Case No. 34-2019-00257463, ruling dated October 22, 2021 [holding that recyclable scrap

6 metal that has not been discarded is not subject to regulation as a "solid waste" under the

7 Integrated Waste Management Act and issuing a preliminary injunction against application of the

8 statute to such materials]).

9 45. Furthermore, the "scrap metal exemption" in the Title 22 regulations expressly
10 provides that scrap metal that is being recycled is "not subject to regulation under this division."

11 22 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 66260.10, 66261.6(a)(3)(B). Accordingly, the "recycling" prong of the

12 definition of "discarded material" has no application to the scrap metal processed by Petitioners'

13 metal shredding facilities. Scrap metal that is being recycled is exempt from regulation under the

14 HWCL and is not a regulated "recyclable material." 22 Cal. Code Regs. § 66261.6(a)(3)(B).'

15 46. Moreover, irrespective of the scrap metal exemption, the materials processed by

16 Petitioners' metal processing operations do not fall within the statutory definition of "recyclable

17 material." "Recyclable material" is defined in Section 25120.5 of the HWCL to mean "a

18 hazardous waste that is capable of being recycled." (Emphasis added.) The statute provides

19 examples of secondary materials that fall within this definition: namely, residues, spent materials,

20 materials that are SO contaminated that they can no longer be used for the purpose for which they

21 were originally purchased or manufactured, byproducts and retrograde materials. The metal-rich

22 materials produced by the shredding process bear no similarity to any of these categories of

23 secondary materials.

24

25 Other provisions of the HWCL confirm that the shredded materials processed in Petitioners'
26 metal processing operations are not "wastes" but instead fall within a category of useful materials known as "intermediate manufacturing process streams." Health & Saf. Code,
27 § 25116.5. These are materials that are produced as part of a manufacturing process and that are used on a batch or continuous basis, in either the same or a different manufacturing process,
28 to produce a commercial product. By law, intermediate manufacturing process streams are not "discarded materials" and thus not "wastes." Id., § 25124(c).

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

47. •DTSC concedes that the scrap metal introduced into Petitioners' metal shredders is

2 exempt from regulation as hazardous waste but now claims the metal-rich in-process material

3 exiting the shredder is not exempt. This distinction is incongruous and is not supported by any

4 provision of law.

5 48. Furthermore, DTSC's OPP #88-6 expressly provides that the mixture of materials

6 exiting a metal shredder is an "in-process" material that is not subject to regulation as a "waste"

7 until after the material has been "exhausted"; i.e., all ferrous and non-ferrous metals have been

8 removed.

9 49. Finally, even if metal shredder aggregate were legally considered a hazardous

10 waste, it is nevertheless eligible for conditional exclusion from classification as a waste, and

11 thus, on information and belief, excluded from regulation under the HWCL as an "excluded

12 recyclable material" under Section 25143.2 of the HWCL.

13 D. S.B. 1249 and DTSC's 2018 Draft Evaluation of Metal Shredder Facilities.

14 50. In 2014, the California Legislature enacted Senate Bill 1249 (Hill) ("S.B. 1249"),

15 Health & Saf. Code, $§ 25150.82 - 25150.86 (effective January 1, 2015), which directed DTSC

16 to conduct an evaluation of metal shredding facilities in the state and authorized DTSC to adopt

17 alternative management standards for hazardous waste management activities within DTSC's

18 jurisdiction conducted at these facilities, as an alternative to the requirements of the HWCL. S.B.

19 1249 did not expand the jurisdiction of the DTSC, nor did it repeal or revise the scrap metal

20 exemption contained in Section 66261.6(a)(3)(B) of the Title 22 regulations.

21 51. As directed, DTSC conducted an investigation to evaluate metal shredding

22 facilities and consider the adoption of alternative management standards. The result of this

23 investigation was published in DTSC's Draft Evaluation and Analysis of Metal Shredding

24 Facilities and Metal Shredder Wastes (January 2018) ("Draft Evaluation").8 The 2018 Draft

25 Evaluation describes the regulatory history of metal shredding facilities, including both DTSC's

26 role in regulating these facilities as well as the roles of other California environmental regulators

27 A copy of the 2018 Draft Evaluation is available on DTSC's website at: https://dtsc.ca.gov/wp-

such as the Regional Water Quality Control Boards, the Air Quality Management Districts and

2 Air Pollution Control Districts, the Certified Unified Program Act agencies, and other state and

3 local agencies.

4 52. The 2018 Draft Evaluation reached several key conclusions pertinent to this

5 action:

6 DTSC evaluated the environmental and public health regulatory oversight history

7 of six metal shredding facilities operated by Petitioners, including hazardous waste

8 regulation by DTSC, air quality regulation by local Air Quality Management

9 Districts or Air Pollution Control Districts, water quality regulation by the

10 Regional Water Quality Control Boards, hazardous waste regulation by the local

11 Certified Unified Program Agencies ("CUPAs"). While incidents such as those

12 discussed in DTSC's Finding of Emergency were identified prior to 2018, DTSC

13 expressed no finding of emergency or other urgent need necessitating any

14 emergency regulatory intervention. See Draft Evaluation, at 21-68.

15 The Draft Evaluation claims that metal shredder residue (i.e., the waste generated

16 at the end of the recycling process) exhibits California-only hazardous

17 characteristics (concentrations of residual metals in excess of regulatory

18 thresholds), rendering it subject to regulation. However, the Draft Evaluation

19 states, "[dJue to challenges in sampling methodology, there is limited empirical

20 data available demonstrating the toxicity of metal shredder aggregate at the precise

21 point of shredding in the hammer mill." Id. at 42. On information and belief,

22 Petitioners assert that DTSC has never conducted any sampling on representative

23 samples of "metal shredder aggregate" and has no scientific basis upon which to

24 claim that it exhibits hazardous characteristics. Therefore, DTSC's conclusion in

25 its Finding of Emergency that metal shredder output contains a large volume of

26 California-regulated hazardous waste and is thus subject to regulation under the

27 HWCL is not supported by substantial evidence. Furthermore, the Draft

28 Evaluation misstates the waste characterization process.
- 17-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

53. At the same time DTSC issued its Draft Evaluation, in January 2018, it issued a

2 document entitled "Proposed Regulatory Path to Metal Shredder Compliance." This document

3 described the development of "an appropriate regulatory framework" for metal shredding

4 facilities "through an open public process" that would include input from all stakeholders. There

5 was no suggestion that an emergency existed at the time, and nothing that has transpired since

6 then that would suggest otherwise.

7 54. Following issuance of the 2018 Draft Evaluation, Petitioners made repeated efforts

8 to engage with DTSC with the goal of exploring alternative ways in which the regulatory

9 framework for metal shredding facilities might be updated to address the agency's concerns.

10 Over the past three-plus years, DTSC never responded to Petitioners' comments, never initiated

11 any rulemaking action, never suggested that the circumstances at metal shredding facilities posed

12 an "emergency," and in fact indicated on several occasions that it had no obligation to even

13 finalize the Draft Evaluation.

14 E. DTSC's August 2021 Final Evaluation of Metal Shredder Facilities.

15 55. After three years of silence, on August 2021, DTSC released its final Evaluation

16 and Analysis of Metal Shredding Facilities and Metal Shredder Wastes ("Final Evaluation"). A

17 copy of the Final Evaluation is available on DTSC's website. Contrary to DTSC's claims, the

18 metal shredding industry was not involved in the preparation of the Final Evaluation. Only after
19 Respondents' release of the Emergency Regulations did Petitioners learn that the Draft

20 Evaluation had been under revision by Respondents, behind closed doors and with no input from

21 or engagement with the public or regulated community, in order to repurpose the Evaluation to

22 support the Emergency Regulations. 10

23 56. As described further below, DTSC's Finding of Emergency relies heavily on the

24 August 2021 Final Evaluation to support the claimed existence of an emergency. However, the

25 Final Evaluation contains largely the same information presented in the 2018 Draft Evaluation,

26

27 Notably, the Final Evaluation was not publicly available on August 9, when DTSC issued its first notice of emergency rulemaking and finding of emergency and was only made publicly
28 available on DTSC's website on August 23, 2021. 10 See: https://dtsc.ca.gov/metal-shredding-facilities-and-wastes-implementation-of-sb-1249/. -18-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 including the very same conditions that are now claimed to create an unforeseen emergency.

2 Although the Final Evaluation is embellished and deletes discussion pertinent to the original

3 purpose of the Draft Evaluation, the underlying facts remain the same, albeit updated to reflect a

4 handful of non-emergency events occurring between 2018 and 2020 which have been

5 appropriately addressed through enforcement actions by DTSC or other regulatory agencies or

6 voluntary corrective measures undertaken by Petitioners. None of those more recent events, by

7 themselves or collectively, constitute an "emergency."

8 57. In fact, the most substantive changes to the Evaluation do not relate to the industry

9 at all, but rather to shoring up DTSC's legal rationale for overturning the long-standing

10 interpretation of the scrap metal exemption. These are not mere changes in "terminology," as

11 DTSC insists (Final Evaluation, at 1), but are instead aimed at moving the "point of waste

12 generation" from the end of the industrial process to the beginning of the metal production

13 process, where the materials are appropriately and accurately described as "intermediate
14| manufacturing process streams" under Health and Safety Code Section 25116.5. This long-
15 standing interpretation was delineated in the now-rescinded OPP # 88-6, which placed the point

16 of waste generation at the end of the metal processing operation, after all recoverable metals have

17 been removed. At that point, OPP # 88-6 described the in-process material as "exhausted" and

18 therefore a waste.

19 58. The Final Evaluation states that metal shredder residue, not metal shredder

20 aggregate, demonstrates toxicity under California standards rendering it subject to regulation

21 under the HWCL. With respect to shredder aggregate (or, more correctly, shredder output),

22 however, DTSC concedes, as it did in 2018, that, "[d]ue to challenges in sampling methodology

23 at the precise point of shredding in the hammer mill, there is limited empirical data available on

24 the characteristics of metal shredder aggregate at this point." Id. at 33. DTSC therefore relies on

25 conjecture in its Finding of Emergency to conclude that metal shredder aggregate may be

26 regulated as hazardous waste. Further, the Draft Evaluation cites no legal basis for moving the

27 point of waste generation to the beginning of the process, and DTSC's declaration that "metal

28 shredder aggregate" is not scrap metal is unsupported by law or common sense.

F. The 2019 ISRI Litigation.

2 59. On November 26, 2019, Petitioners filed a Complaint for Declaratory and
Injunctive Relief in Sacramento County Superior Court seeking a judicial declaration of the scope

4 of DTSC's authority-if any--under current law to regulate scrap metal recycling and processing

5 operations as hazardous waste treatment under the HWCL. Specifically, the 2019 ISRI Action

6 seeks a judicial declaration that: (1) operation of a metal shredder (hammer mill or shredding

7 device) does not require a permit or other form of authorization from DTSC; (2) metal processing

8 operations do not constitute treatment of hazardous waste and do not require a permit or other

9 form of authorization from DTSC; (3) the scrap metal exemption set forth in Section
10 66261.6(a)(3)(B) of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations applies during metal

11 processing operations; and (4) none of the following materials are subject to regulation as

12 hazardous waste: shredder feedstock, shredder output, aggregate, and ferrous and non-ferrous

13 metals that are produced by metal processing operations. The 2019 ISRJ Action also seeks an

14 injunction barring DTSC from requiring Petitioners to apply for hazardous waste treatment

15 permits for their metal processing operations.

16 60. In effect, the ISRI Action seeks a judicial determination that DTSC is barred from

17 taking the very action it is taking under the Emergency Regulations: to regulate the processing of

18 shredded scrap metal as hazardous waste. With this litigation pending and in the discovery phase,

19 DTSC now openly admits, in its 5-Day Public Notice, that it had an "urgent need" to amend the

20 emergency basis in order to vest itself with regulatory authority it definition of scrap metal on an

21 currently does not possess, before the Court has an opportunity to hear the case and creating an

22 end-run around the judicial process. The coup de grace is DTSC's issuance of the "Call-In

23 Letters" to Petitioners on October 25, 2021 directing that each shredding facility submit a permit

24 application for a Hazardous Waste Facility Permit within 30 days or cease operations.

G. DTSC's Purported "Emergency" Findings and Adoption of the Emergency

2 Regulations.

3 61. The Emergency Regulations are DTSC's second (or third) attempt to adopt

4 emergency regulations to amend the state "scrap metal" definition in the Title 22 regulations. On

5 August 9, 2021, DTSC issued a 5-Day Notice of the agency's proposal to adopt emergency

6 regulations to Petitioners and other interested parties. The notice provided that the comment

7 period for interested parties would be August 16 through August 21, 2021. On Wednesday,

8 August 18, 2021, DTSC posted a notice on its Emergency Rulemaking website directing

9 interested parties to disregard the comment period referenced in the August 9 notice.

10 62. On August 30, 2021, DTSC submitted a 5-Day Public Notice, Scrap Metal

11 Definition Revision to OAL.12 The public comment period for this first set of emergency

12 regulations opened on August 31, 2021 and closed on September 7, 2021. Petitioners submitted

13 timely comments to OAL on September 7, 2021 ("September 7 Comments"). The comments

14 described numerous deficiencies in the proposed regulations, including, among other issues,

15 DTSC's failure to establish the existence of an "emergency" under the APA and DTSC's failure

16 to prepare an adequate environmental analysis under CEQA. The comments set forth substantial

17 evidence documenting the lack of any facts or circumstances justifying DTSC's attempt to use its
18 emergency rulemaking powers to regulate Petitioners' metal processing operations.

19 63. On or about September 9, 2021, DTSC withdrew the emergency regulations and

20 posted a notice on its website that there is "[n]o emergency regulation at this time."

21 64. On October 15, 2021, DTSC submitted a revised 5-Day Public Notice of Proposed

22 Action, Regulation of Metal Shredder Aggregate ("Five-Day Notice" or "Notice") to OAL, along

23 with an Economic and Fiscal Impact Statement (Form STD 399), Notice of
24 Publication/Regulations Submission (Form STD 400), and a CEQA Notice of Exemption (OAL

was essentially identical to the Notice issued by the agency on August 9. - 21 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

65. The 5-Day Notice states that the Emergency Regulations are intended to clarify the

2 definition of "scrap metal" in 22 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 66260.10 and 66273.9 by defining the term

3 "metal shredder aggregate" and excluding "metal shredder aggregate" from the California

4 definition of scrap metal. Ex. C Notice at 1. The Notice also states that immediate adoption of

5 the Regulations is the "only timely option" to "mitigate the existing environmental and public

6 health impacts associated with metal shredding activities, avoid and prevent future harmful events

7 such as fires, explosions, and the release of hazardous waste... and provide a pathway for metal

8 shredders to operate in an environmentally- and health-protective manner." Id., at 2.

9 66. The Notice includes a "Finding of Emergency," which asserts the following in

10 support of DTSC's emergency determination:

11 2021 Final Evaluation: DTSC cites extensively to the conclusions of the August

12 2021 Final Evaluation, along with "several recent findings and occurrences," in

13 claiming that "the current regulatory system has created an unforeseen emergency

14 necessitating immediate action to avoid serious and imminent harm to the public

15 peace, health, safety, and general welfare." Notice, at 1. DTSC cites several

16 conclusions from the Final Evaluation, including that "metal shredding facilities

17 generate and manage a large volume of a mixed wastestream (i.e., metal shredder

18 aggregate) composed of recoverable scrap metal and non-RCRA hazardous waste"

19 subject to regulation under the HWCL, and that "the point of generation of this

20 hazardous waste is at the shredder itself, and ... all activity downstream of the

21 hammer mill constitutes hazardous waste management." Id.

22 Incidents at Metal Shredder Facilities: DTSC also cites several "incidents" at

23 California metal shredding facilities identified in the Final Evaluation, including

24 past fires, explosions, contamination of soil and stormwater, and offsite migration

25 of hazardous waste. Id. at 1, 4. DTSC asserts that these incidents--some

26 occurring more than 10 years agodemonstrate the "ongoing significant risks to

27 human health and safety and the environment" posed by these facilities under the

28 current regulatory system, and require "immediate action." Id., at 1. As described
-22 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

I further herein, the specific categories of harm identified in the Finding of

2 Emergency are the same as those discussed in the 2018 Draft Evaluation and

3 known to DTSC even years before, yet DTSC expressed no finding of emergency

4 necessitating urgent regulatory action in January 2018, when the Draft Evaluation

5 was published.

6 Lack of Clarity: The Finding of Emergency states that DTSC has identified a

7 "lack of clarity" in the regulations "pertaining to the regulatory classification of

8 metal shredder aggregate," and asserts that failure to address this lack of clarity
9. "will result in continuation of the ongoing environmental and public health

10 impacts." Id. at 1. DTSC asserts that the Emergency Regulation is necessary to

11 resolve this lack of clarity and "to provide a pathway for metal shredding to occur

12 in an environmentally and health-protective manner." Id.

13 2019 ISRI Lawsuit: Finally, DTSC's Finding of Emergency states that one of the

14 primary purposes of the Emergency Regulations is to improve its legal position in

15 the pending 2019 ISRI Action, noting that the pending 2019 ISRI Action

16 "demonstrates an urgent need for clarification of the appropriate regulation of

17 metal shredding facilities and metal shredder aggregate to address the

18 aforementioned environmental and public health impacts, and further underscores

19 the lack of clarity in the regulation of certain activities at metal shredding

20 facilities." Id., at 4.

21 67. DTSC's Finding of Emergency confirms the agency's intention to regulate metal

22 processing operations at metal shredding facilities in a California in a wholly new manner under the

23 HWCL: "DTSC has determined that metal shredder aggregate is a hazardous waste and not a

24 scrap metal, and that metal shredding facilities conduct treatment activities on metal shredder

25 aggregate to reclaim recoverable ferrous and non-ferrous metals." Id., at 4. The Notice also

26 states that "[i]f the proposed emergency rulemaking is approved, metal shredder aggregate will be

27 unambiguously excluded from the definition of scrap metal" and "[t]he regulations relevant to

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 ferrous metals from metal shredder aggregate represent hazardous waste treatment activity

2 requiring DTSC authorization." Id., at 5 (emphasis added). These statements are in direct

3 conflict with the law regarding the management of scrap metal and involve the central questions

4 on which Petitioners seek judicial review in the 2019 ISRI Action.

5 68. The public comment period for the Emergency Regulations opened on October 15,

6 2021 and closed on October 20, 2021. Petitioners submitted timely comments to OAL on

7 October 20, 2021 ("October 2020 Comment Letter"). The comments again described numerous

8 deficiencies in the Emergency Regulations, including, among other issues, DTSC's failure to

9 establish the requisite conditions of an "emergency" under the APA; DTSC's failure to comply

10 with the APA's substantive rulemaking standards of "necessity" and "authority"; DTSC's failure

11 to prepare an economic analysis pursuant to the APA; and DTSC's failure to evaluate the

12 potential adverse environmental effects of the Regulations under CEQA. A partial copy of the

13 October 20 Comment Letter is attached as Exhibit D as is incorporated herein by reference.

14 69. On October 25, 2021, OAL approved the Emergency Regulations, and the

15 regulations became effective that same day upon filing with the Secretary of State. On that same

16 day, Respondents unilaterally rescinded OPP # 88-6.

17 70. On October 25, 2021, Respondents also issued the "Call-In Letters" to Petitioners

18 directing them to submit permit applications for Hazardous Waste Facility Permits within 30 days

19 or otherwise be in violation of the HWCL and required to stop operations. The initial estimated

20 cost to process these applications was set at almost $500,000 per facility.

21 H. The Emergency Regulations were Enacted in Violation of the APA.

22 1. The Facts Recited in DTSC's Finding of Emergency do not Constitute an

23 Emergency.

24 71. The Emergency Regulations do not meet the statutory requirements for emergency

25 rulemaking under the APA. The APA defines an "emergency" as "a situation that calls for

26 immediate action to avoid serious harm to the public peace, health, safety, or general welfare."

27 Gov. Code, § 11342.545. Before an agency can issue emergency regulations, it must make a

28
- 24 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 finding that an "emergency" properly exists. An agency's finding of emergency must include,

2 among other things:

3 [A] written statement that contains... a description of the specific facts demonstrating the existence of an emergency and the need for immediate action, and demonstrating, by
4 substantial evidence, the need for the proposed regulation to effectuate the statute being implemented, interpreted, or made specific and to address only the demonstrated
5 emergency. The finding of emergency shall also identify each technical, theoretical, and empirical study, report, or similar document, if any, upon which the agency relies..
6
A finding of emergency based only upon expediency, convenience, best interest, general
7 public need, or speculation. shall not be adequate to demonstrate the existence of an
emergency. If the situation identified in the finding of emergency existed and was known
8 by the agency adopting the emergency regulation in sufficient time to have been addressed through nonemergency regulations adopted in accordance with Ithe APA1. the finding of
9 emergency shall include facts explaining the failure to address the situation through nonemergency regulations.
10
Gov. Code, § 11346.1(b)(2).
11

12 72. DTSC's Emergency Regulations fall far short of these standards. First, DTSC has

13. failed to establish, by substantial evidence, the existence of any "emergency" justifying the

14 adoption of the Emergency Regulations. The conditions described in the Finding of Emergency

15 that are claimed to pose an unforeseen grave danger have been well-known to the Department

16 over a period of many years and until now have never been deemed to constitute a public health

17 emergency.

18 73. The Notice describes the adverse human health effects associated with lead,

19 copper and zinc under a heading titled "Key Risks Associated with Metal Shredding Facility

20 Activity." See Ex. C Notice, at 3. However, nowhere does the Notice describe any actual

21 community exposure to metal shredder aggregate, much less any exposure at a level that would

22 cause the adverse health effects described in the Notice.

23 74. The Department failed to provide substantial evidence to support its assertion that

24 metal shredder aggregate is a "hazardous waste." Tellingly, no factual support is offered for the

25 conclusion, in the first instance, that the scrap metal recycled by Petitioners is, in fact, a discarded

26 waste. Labelling these materials as end-of-life consumer products provides no basis to conclude

27 they are wastes under California law and subject to DTSC's authority.

28
- 25 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

75. While DTSC collected samples of in-process material that it describes as "metal

2 shredder aggregate," these samples are not representative of metal shredder aggregate because

3 they do not contain the metals that are inherent in this material. The 2021 Final Evaluation

4 confirms that DTSC has never tested representative samples of metal shredder aggregate to

5 determine whether this material as a whole, as opposed to only a component of the material,

6 exhibits a hazardous characteristic. See Final Evaluation, at 33.

7 76. DTSC's previous August 30 finding of emergency asserted that metal shredding

8 facilities pose ongoing risks to human health and safety and the environment as a result of the

9 potential for off-site releases of hazardous waste, fires and smoke inhalation, explosions, and

10 contamination of soil and stormwater. Petitioners commented extensively on this proposed

11 emergency rulemaking regarding the lack of substantial evidence supporting a finding of

12 emergency on the basis of any of these asserted past risks. DTSC's revised Finding of

13 Emergency for the Regulations now makes only passing reference to the risk of fires, explosions

14 and soil/stormwater contamination, without offering any specific evidence as to the gravity or

15 immediacy of such risks, how the risk of these events compares with other industrial operations,

16 or that these risks are even associated with the targeted processing of metal shredder aggregate.

17 The types of harm that are alleged by DTSC to establish a public health emergency in need of

18 immediate action are discussed below.

19 77. Potential for Fires and Explosions. More specifically, DTSC points to the

20 occurrence of fires and explosions that occasionally occur at metal shredding facilities as

21 presenting an emergency situation that can only be addressed through the Emergency

22 Regulations. As described further in Petitioners' September 7 Comment Letter, the agency's

23 characterization of this risk is grossly exaggerated. DTSC's Final Evaluation references a total of

24 only four fires in the past 10 years, two of which occurred in 2013, one in 2018 and one in 2020.

25 Significantly, only one of those fires involved material that DTSC now considers to be a

26 hazardous waste. Further, only one explosion has occurred at a metal shredding facility, in 2007,

27 in equipment that Respondents concede is not part of the purported hazardous waste treatment

28 operation. The industry takes the risk of fires and energy releases extremely seriously, and metal
- 26 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 shredding facilities adhere to rigorous source control and inspection programs, as well as detailed

2 fire prevention, detection and response programs. See September 7 Comment Letter, at 11-13.

3 Nowhere does DTSC establish that the past fires, in fact, presented a grave risk to human health

4 or safety. Therefore, DTSC's claim that the risk of fire and explosions at metai shredding

5 facilities constitutes an "emergency" situation is not supported by substantial evidence.

6 78. Potential for Off-site Dispersal of LFM. DTSC's Finding of Emergency primarily

7 identifies "offsite migration and deposition of hazardous waste and/or hazardous waste

8 constituents into heavily trafficked commercial areas" as a basis for the Emergency Regulations.

9 Ex. C Notice at 1,3-4. As described further in Petitioners' October 20 Comment Letter, "Light

10 Fibrous Material" (or "LFM"), the lightest fraction of the in-process material consisting largely of

11 shredded carpet and other synthetic fabrics contained in end-of-life vehicles, has the potential to

12 escape from the metal shredding process and be dispersed by wind outside the facility. See Ex. D

13 October 20 Comment Letter, at 6-7. DTSC's Finding of Emergency describes a number of recent

14 inspections in which DTSC identified off-site releases of LFM at metal shredding facilities. See

15 Ex. C Notice, at 3-4. However, DTSC neglects to mention that the potential for this material to

16 be released outside a facility has been known for over a decade, that releases of the material a have

17 been significantly reduced by engineering controls installed by the metal shredding industry, and

18 that such releases have never been associated with any evidence of actual harm to human health

19 or the environment. As documented in a formal Health Risk Evaluation conducted in 2018, LFM

20 has been demonstrated not to pose a risk to human health unless it is incidentally ingested in

21 quantities that are extremely unlikely to ever occur. See Ex. D October 20 Comment Letter, at 6-

22 7 13 In 2014, DTSC's own toxicologist determined that LFM releases do not pose a human health

23 risk outside the shredding facility in Oakland, and periodic testing of employees at metal shredder

24 facilities has not revealed human health risks. Id., at 7-8. DTSC's Finding of Emergency

25 contains no description of the quantities of LFM that were identified in these most recent

26 13 The Health Risk Evaluation was performed Dr. Robert Scofield, a Board-certified toxicologist.
27 Dr. Scofield has reaffirmed his professional opinion that low level and infrequent exposure to LFM does not pose a significant health risk, even to sensitive receptors that may be present in
28 the area and thus cannot be considered to present a grave danger as is needed to satisfy this prong of the "emergency" analysis. See Technical Memorandum dated October 19, 2021. - 27 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 inspections, how these quantities compared to amounts that were observed during previous

2 inspections, where they were located, or whether there was any realistic probability of significant

3 community exposure that could cause grave harm.

4 79. Furthermore, LFM controls at metal shredding facilities have greatly improved in

5 recent years, due to numerous environmental improvements such as the construction of

6 permanent enclosures around the shredder hammer mill, non-ferrous metal recovery plants and

7 associated state-of-the-art particulate emission control systems, further undercutting any claim of

8 emergency. These measures have greatly reduced to potential for off-site releases of LFM. See

9 Ex D October 20 Comment Letter, at 8-9.

10 80. Potential Contamination of Soil and Storm Water. DTSC points to the risk of the

11 "contamination of soil and stormwater" at metal shredding facilities as evidence of an emergency

12 situation. Ex. C Notice, at 1. However, DTSC has not pointed to any evidence indicating that

13 any such contamination now presents a grave risk to public health or the environment. The Final

14 Evaluation contains no evidence that operations at metal shredding facilities cause or contribute

15 water quality impairment attributable to storm water discharges and absolutely no evidence that

16 would support a finding of emergency on this basis. See Ex D September 7 Comment Letter, at

17 16-17.

18 81. Finally, DTSC cites the 2019 ISRI Action as a factor supporting the "urgent" need

19 for adoption of the Emergency Regulations. See Ex. C Notice, at 4. However, the Notice fails to

20 mention that the lawsuit seeks a declaration from the Court that DTSC has nO authority under

21 current law to regulate scrap metal recycling and processing operations as hazardous waste

22 treatment. In effect, DTSC seeks to avoid a judicial determination of its authority by quickly
23 promulgating Emergency Regulations that purport to provide this missing authority. This

24 purpose does not qualify as an emergency under the law. Under the APA, "[a] finding of

25 emergency based only upon expediency, convenience, best interest, general public need, or

26 speculation, shall not be adequate to demonstrate the existence of an emergency." Gov. Code,

27 § 11346.1(b)(2).

28
- 28 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 82. In short, DTSC has not established by substantial evidence that the processing of

2 metal shredder aggregate constitutes public health emergency, for which immediate action must

3 be taken by adoption of the proposed emergency regulations.

4 2. DTSC Fails to Show a "Nexus" Between the Emergency Regulations and

5 the Alleged Emergency.

6 83. DTSC also failed to demonstrate by substantial evidence that the Emergency

7 Regulations will; in fact, address the claimed emergency, as required by the APA: "Any finding

8 of emergency shall [demonstrate], by substantial evidence, the need for the proposed regulation

9 to effectuate the statute being implemented, interpreted or made specific and to address only the

10 demonstrated emergency." Gov. Code, § 11346.1(b)(2) (emphasis added).

11 84. DTSC's Finding of Emergency does not provide a nexus between the adoption of

12 the Emergency Regulation and resolution of the "emergency" allegedly created by the continued

13 operation of metal shredding facilities without a hazardous waste treatment permit. Indeed, such

14 permitting will take several years to complete, will trigger additional land use permitting and

15 other local land use approvals (if this could be accomplished at all), and will be handled by DTSC

16 permitting staff who have no experience in writing permits for metal shredding facilities, which

17 bear no resemblance to traditional hazardous waste treatment facilities. DTSC has presented no

18 evidence to support its claim that requiring metal shredding facilities to apply for hazardous waste

19 permits will somehow immediately "avoid and prevent future harmful events such as fires,

20 explosions and the release of hazardous waste." Id., at 2.

21 85. Imposing a regulatory regime that will take years to apply and implement will do

22 nothing to proximately change the status quo to reduce the alleged incidents of concern. As

23 DTSC notes, following approval of the Emergency Regulations, metal shredding facilities "will

24 be required to obtain interim status authorization to continue operating through the permit

25 application process" pending issuance of hazardous waste facility permit. Notice, at 5.

26 Petitioners are unable to comply immediately with many of these requirements and achieving

27 compliance would likely take years of facility reconstruction at a cost of many millions of dollars.

28 During this interim process, DTSC will be unaffected (as compared to prior to the adoption of the
-29 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

F Emergency Regulations), exercising the same authority it possessed since the inception of the

2 HWCL and certainly since it first concluded the SB 1249 investigation in 2018. Furthermore, the

3 imposition of the full regimen of hazardous waste management facility requirements is

4 unnecessary to address any minor off-site releases of LFM, that represent no actual community

5 health risk.

6 3. DTSC Fails to Explain why it did not Address the "Emergency"

7 Conditions through Nonemergency Regulations.

8 86. DTSC failed to provide any credible justification for why the alleged "emergency"

9 could not have been addressed through nonemergency regulations subject to the normal APA

10 notice-and-comment requirements. The APA provides: "If the situation identified in the finding

11 of emergency existed and was known by the agency adopting the emergency regulation in

12 sufficient time to have been addressed through nonemergency regulations adopted in accordance

13 with [the APA], the finding of emergency shall include facts explaining the failure to address the

14 situation through nonemergency regulations." Gov. Code, § 11346.1(b)(2).

15 87. DTSC's long-standing, documented knowledge of the events described in its

16 Finding of Emergency contradicts its assertion of a sudden and "unforeseen" emergency.

17 DTSC's August 2021 Final Evaluation, which DTSC cites to support the claimed "urgent need"

18 for the Emergency Regulations, was issued in draft form almost four years ago and expressly

19 raised all of the alleged "harms" that are now claimed to pose a grave threat to public health.

20 Despite its long-standing knowledge of these claimed harms, DTSC fails to explain why the

21 proposed changes could not have been addressed through nonemergency regulations subject to

22 the traditional APA notice-and-comment process, following the publication of the 2018 Draft

23 Report. Instead, DTSC elected to wait until late 2021 to adopt the regulations through the

24 accelerated emergency rulemaking pröcess, precluding opportunities for public notice and

25 comment. DTSC's claim of an "unforeseen" emergency is further contradicted by the fact that

26 the Emergency Regulations are the agency's third attempt since early August to modify the

27 "scrap metal" definition on an emergency basis. Documents obtained from OAL through a recent

28 Public Records Act request confirm that Respondents began working on emergency regulations at
- 30 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 least as early as March 5, 2021, if not before, during which time a regular rulemaking could have

2 been initiated. Such advance planning and deliberation undercut the assertion of an emergency.

3 4. The Emergency Regulations Do Not Comply with the Substantive

4 Rulemaking Standards of Section 11349.1.

5 88. Under the APA, the OAL must disapprove emergency regulations if, among other

6 things, "it determines that the regulation fails to meet the standards set forth in Section 11349.1."

7 For the reasons described below and in Petitioners' Comment Letter, the Emergency Regulations

8 fail to meet the APA's standards of "necessity" and "authority" pursuant to Gov. Code

9 § 11349.1(a).

10 89. Necessitv. DTSC's finding of emergency must be supported by substantial

11 evidence of significant actual or imminent harm to public health or the environment, and the

12 Emergency Regulations must be "necessary" to reduce or eliminate that harm. For the reasons

13 described above, DTSC's Finding of Emergency does not establish the existence of an
14 /"emergency" sufficient to support the adoption of Emergency Regulations. Furthermore, the

15 Emergency Regulations impose permanent obligations on metal shredding facilities that go far

16 beyond any measures needed to resolve the alleged "urgent health and environmental risks"

17 discussed in the Finding of Emergency. The Emergency Regulations are not necessary to

18 implement the provisions of the HWCL.

19 90. Authority. DTSC lacks the authority under the HWCL to adopt and enforce the

20 Emergency Regulations. First, DTSC has no authority under the HWCL to regulate materials that

21 are not hazardous wastes (a material must be a waste and exhibit hazardous characteristics in

22 order to be subject to regulation under the HWCL). DTSC's assumption that metal shredder

23 aggregate is a hazardous waste is not supported by substantial evidence, as DTSC concedes in the

24 Final Evaluation. See Final Evaluation, at 33 ("[d]ue to challenges in sampling methodology at

25 the precise point of shredding in the hammer mill, there is limited empirical data available on the

26 characteristics of metal shredder aggregate at this point."). In fact, DTSC has never collected or

27 analyzed representative samples of metal shredder aggregate, nor attempted to determine whether
28 this material, as a whole, would exhibit hazardous characteristics if analyzed in accordance with
- 31 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

-

2 the technical guidance published by DTSC for characterization of materials containing elemental

metals.

3 91.

4 shredder DTSC asserts that, with the adoption of the Emergency Regulations, "metal

5 aggregate will be unambiguously excluded from the definition of scrap metal" and "the

6 activities conducted to recover ferrous and non-ferrous metals from metal shredder aggregate

7 represent hazardous waste treatment activity requiring DTSC authorization." Ex. C Notice, at 5.

8 This assertion contradicts California Supreme Court precedent that recyclable materials that are

9 kept out of the solid waste stream and sold or donated for value are not considered "discarded"

10 materials subject to regulation under the Integrated Waste Management Act. See Waste

11 Management of the Desert, supra, 7 Cal. 4th at 487. It also ignores the fact that shredder output

12 is eligible for conditional exclusion from regulation under the HWCL pursuant to Health and

13 Safety Code Section 25143.2(d). DTSC has no authority to override these statutory exclusions
through regulatory action.

14 92.

15 Finally, the HWCL provides no legal basis to support the Department's conclusion

16 that "the point of generation of [metal shredder aggregate] is at the shredder itself, and that all

17 activity downstream of the hammer mill constitutes hazardous waste management." Notice, at 1.

18 DTSC cites the Final Evaluation as authority for its regulation of metal shredder aggregate as a

19 hazardous waste, but the Evaluation lacks the force of law. Moreover, as DTSC has conceded, it

20 has not conducted sampling of metal shredder aggregate or any such mixed waste stream and, as
such is assertion of authority is based on conjecture.

21 5.

22 In Adopting the Regulations. DTSC Failed to Conduct the Required
Economic Analysis.

23 93.

24 The Emergency Regulations will have serious economic consequences for

25 Petitioners, the state and the public, greatly exceeding the $50 million threshold required for

26 "*major regulations." Yet DTSC failed to undertake and publicly disclose the mandated economic

27 impact analysis as required by the APA and other provisions of the Government Code. Section

28 11349.1(d)(2) requires OAL to return any regulation if the agency fails to comply with Section
11346.3, meaning the agency "failed to complete the economic impact assessment or
- 32 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

standardized regulatory impact analysis required by Section 11346.3 or failed to include the

2 assessment or analysis" in the rulemaking file. Pursuant to Section 11346.3(a), prior to

3 submitting a proposal to adopt regulations, DTSC "shall assess the potential for adverse economic

4 impact on California business enterprises and individuals." That assessment must consider "the

5 impact on business, with consideration of industries affected including the ability of California

6 businesses to compete with businesses in other states." ld., § 11346.3(a)(2).

7 94. DTSC ignored, or purposefully avoided, its obligation to assess the economic

8 impact of the Emergency Regulations and to disclose the cost to businesses and the metal

9 shredding industry in California, including costs that will inevitably be passed on to

10 municipalities. DTSC failed to analyze any of the required statutory factors including: the

11 creation or elimination of jobs within California; the creation of new businesses or the elimination

12 of existing businesses within California; the expansion of businesses currently doing business in

13 California; impacts to small businesses; the competitive advantages or disadvantages for

14 businesses currently doing business within California; the increase or decrease of investment in

15 California; the incentives for innovation in products, materials or processes; the specific

16 categories of individuals and business enterprises that would be affected by the regulation;

17 significant adverse economic effect on business; and the cost impact on a representative person or

18 business.

19 95. DTSC's bare conclusion that its regulatory action will have no significant adverse

20 impact on businesses and other entities referenced in the Economic Impact and Fiscal Statement

21 iS not supported by evidence or rational analysis. See Western States Petroleum Ass'n v. Board of

22 Equalization (2013) 57 Cal.4th 401, 428 (the agency "shall provide in the record any facts,

23 evidence, documents, testimony, or other evidence upon which it relies" for its determination of

24 economic impact [citations and internal quotations omitted]). Mere "speculative belief is not

25 sufficient to support an agency declaration of its initial determination about economic impact."

26 Id. (citation omitted).

27 96. DTSC aiso relies on a series of "assumptions" in its fiscal analysis that are

28 inaccurate and incomplete in Addendum A to Form STD 399 (Fiscal Impact Assumptions). Two
-33 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

I of these assumptions are completely inaccurate: (1) that the Emergency Regulations "[do] not

2 impose new regulatory requirements but rather clarify[y] the status of metal shredder aggregate,"

3 and (2) that "this [Emergency] regulation makes only technical, non-substantive or clarifying

4 changes to current law regulations." Both of these statements are directly contradicted by the

5 Finding of Emergency which states the opposite: that, upon approval of the Emergency

6 Regulations, metal shedding facilities will be required to submit Part A of the hazardous waste

7 permit application within 30 days of the effective date and will be required immediately to

8 comply with all applicable interim status regulations in Chapter 15 of the Department's

9 regulations, plus any additional conditions "which the department deems necessary to protect

10 public health or the environment," pending issuance of a permit. See Health & Saf. Code,

11 25200.5(c). DTSC has already issued "Call-In Letters" to all Petitioners, the processing of

12 which will necessitate significant additional permitting and enforcement resources. DTSC

13 estimates roughly $500,000 per facility must be paid as a cost reimbursement for permit

14 processing. Additional enforcement actions will also be needed to bring clandestine shredders

15 owned and operated by entities other than Petitioners under the purview of the Department. None

16 of these costs are mentioned.

17 97. Overall, DTSC made no effort to provide "adequate information" concerning the
18 consequences of the proposed action, instead checking boxes on Form 399 that disclaim any

19 economic or fiscal impact at all. DTSC failed to provide the public and Petitioners with the

20 required information regarding the economic impacts of the Emergency Regulations, in violation

21 of the APA.

22 I. Respondents' Unilateral Rescission of OPP #88-6 Was in Violation of the

23 APA.

24 98. Compounding the impropriety of the Emergency Regulations, DTSC rescinded

25 # OPP # 88-6, without providing any opportunity for public comment. The August 23, 2021 Notice

26 to Interested Stakeholders was the first notice Petitioners received of any impending rescission of

27 # OPP # 88-6, which is nowhere mentioned in the Emergency Regulations. Given the length of

28 time OPP #88-6 has been in effect (over 35 years), and the level of capital investment that has
- 34 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

I been made by metal shredding facilities in direct reliance on this policy, OPP #88-6 is a de facto

2 regulation and can only be repealed in accordance with the APA. See Tidewater Marine Western,

3 Inc. v. Bradshaw (1996) 14 Cal. 4th 557. DTSC's unilateral rescission of OPP #88-6

4 immediately on the heels of OAL's approval of the Emergency Regulations violated the APA.

5 Moreover, Respondents' asserted three-pronged rationale for rescission of the policy-that it was

6 (1) only ever intended as internal guidance to DTSC staff, (2) inexact and self-contradictory, and

7 (3) in conflict with state and federal law-is factually and legally incorrect in each respect.

8 J. Harm to Petitioners.

9 99. The Emergency Regulations will cause immediate significant harm to Petitioners
10 by subjecting them to an entirely different, extremely costly, and unwarranted regulatory regime,
11 the application of which will have severe operational and economic consequences for these

12 important facilities, possibly leading to cessation of operations of some or all of them.

13 Furthermore, DTSC has chosen to make these changes under the accelerated timetable of the

14 emergency rulemaking procedures, thereby depriving Petitioners and the public of a meaningful

15 opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process.

16 100. The immediacy of harm arising from DTSC's ultra vires action arises from the

17 fact that metal processing operations at metal shredding facilities are now subject to a rigid and

18 ill-suited set of interim status hazardous waste requirements all of which apply pending the

19 issuance of a Hazardous Waste Facility Permit. Immediate compliance with these requirements,

20 found in division 4.5, chapters 15 and 20 of Title 22 of the California Code of Regulations, plus

21 any other as-yet unspecified requirements Respondents may seek to impose upon Petitioners

22 during interim status, is required as a condition to continued lawful operation. See Health & Saf.

23 Code, § 25200.5(c). Non-compliance with any of these requirements subjects Petitioners to

24 significant financial and injunctive penalties. Confirmation of this fact is illustrated by DTSC's

25 immediate issuance of "Call-In Letters" to Petitioners on October 25, 2021 directing each

26 Petitioner to submit a permit application for a Hazardous Waste Facility Permit to lawfully

27 conduct metal shredding activities or suffer significant penalties and forced closure of their

28 facilities. Moreover, compliance with the hazardous waste regulations cannot be achieved
- 35 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 overnight, and many of the requirements are fundamentally incompatible with the operation of

2 metal recycling facilities, placing Petitioners in an impossible situation. On information and

3 belief, Petitioners are unaware of any circumstance in the history of the HWCL in which DTSC

4 has summarily reclassified an in-process material as a "waste," thereby subjecting an entire

5 industry to hazardous waste regulation literally overnight.

6 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

7 Declaratory and Injunctive Relief - No Emergency

8 (Code Civ. Proc. § 1060; Gov. Code § 11350)

9 101. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate herein by reference the allegations of all

10 foregoing paragraphs.

11 102. The APA provides that "[a]ny interested party may obtain a judicial declaration as

12 to the validity of any regulation…by bringing an action for declaratory relief in the superior court

13 in accordance with the Code of Civil Procedure." Gov. Code, § 11350(a).

14 103. Under the APA, a court may declare an agency's emergency regulations "invalid"

15 if the facts recited in the agency's finding of emergency "do not constitute an emergency within

16 the provisions of Section 11346.1." Gov. Code, § 11350(a).

17 104. The APA defines "emergency" as "a situation that calls for immediate action to

18 avoid serious harm to the public peace, health, safety, or general welfare." Id., § 11342.545

19 (emphasis added); see Doe v. Wilson (1997) 57 Cal.App.4th 296, 300 (defining "emergency" for

20 purposes of the APA as "an unforeseen situation calling for immediate action" [citation omitted]).

21 A finding of emergency under the APA may not be based on "expediency, convenience, best

22 interest, general public need, or speculation." Gov. Code, § 11346.1(b)(2). The harm that will

23 occur if emergency action is not taken "must have a basis firmer than simple speculation." Doe,

24 57 Cal.App.4th at 278.

25 105. In adopting the Emergency Regulations, DTSC violated these requirements of the

26 APA. First, the facts recited in DTSC's Finding of Emergency do not establish the existence of

27 an "emergency" as defined in the APA. In addition, nothing in DTSC's Finding of Emergency
28 demonstrates, "by substantial evidence, the need for the proposed regulation" to effectuate the
- 36 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 HWCL. Gov. Code, § 11346.1(b)(2). Instead, as described above, the Emergency Regulations

2 are merely an attempt to bolster DTSC's legal position in the pending litigation filed by

3 Petitioners.

4 106. Second, DTSC failed to provide an explanation for why the situation described in

5 the Emergency Regulations could not have been addressed by nonemergency regulations within

6 the normal APA notice and public comment time frames, as required by Gov. Code

7 Section 11346.1(b)(2). As DTSC concedes in its Finding of Emergency, the agency has been

8 aware of the purported issues described in the finding for years, but fails to explain why the

9 situation could not have been addressed through non-emergency regulations subject to the

10 ordinary APA notice-and-comment requirements. Nor is there substantial is evidence that the

11 situation is dire or warrants a wholesale and immediate change to regulation of the entire industry

12 to protect public health and safety.

13 107. This case presents justiciable issue, in that there is a present and actual

14 controversy between Petitioners and DTSC as to the validity of the Emergency Regulations and

15 whether an "emergency" exists within the meaning of the APA.

16 108. A declaratory judgment in this matter would afford relief from the uncertainty,

17 cost, disruption, conflict and controversy giving rise to this proceeding, and would provide

18 direction to Petitioners and other affected parties regarding the validity of the Emergency

19 Regulations, which are now in effect.

20 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

21 Declaratory Relief - Violation of APA

22 (Code Civ. Proc. § 1060; Gov. Code § 11350)

23 109. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate herein by reference the allegations of all

24 foregoing paragraphs.

25 110. Under the APA, a regulation may be declared invalid if "the agency's
26 determination that the regulation is reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute,

27 court decision, or other provision of law that is being implemented, interpreted or made specific

28 by the regulation is not supported by substantial evidence." Gov. Code, § 11350(b)(1). The APA
- 37 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

requires regulations-including emergency regulations- -to meet standards of "necessity,"
2 | "authority," "clarity," "*consistency," "reference" and "nonduplication." Gov. Code, § 11349.1(a).

3 111. In adopting the Emergency Regulations, as explained in Petitioners' comment

4 letters and alleged herein, DTSC violated the above requirements of the APA, including the

5 APA's standards of "necessity" and "authority." DTSC also failed to conduct the appropriate

6 economic analysis as required by Section 11346.3 of the APA (as incorporated by reference in

7 sections that are applicable to emergency rulemaking), which requires DTSC to "assess the

8 potential for adverse economic impact on California business enterprises and individuals" and to

9 consider "the impact on business, with consideration of industries affected including the ability of

10 California businesses to compete with businesses in other states." Gov. Code, § 11346.3(a)(2).

11 112. This case presents a justiciable issue, in that there is a present and actual

12 controversy between Petitioners and DTSC as to the validity of the Emergency Regulations and

13 DTSC's compliance with the APA.

14 113. A declaratory judgment in this matter would afford relief from the uncertainty,

15 cost, disruption, conflict and controversy giving rise to this proceeding, and would provide

16 direction to Petitioners and other affected parties regarding the validity of the Emergency

17 Regulations, which are now in effect.

18 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

19 Writ of Mandate (Code Civ. Proc. § 1085)

20 114. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate herein by reference the allegations of all

21 foregoing paragraphs.

22 115. For all the reasons alleged herein, DTSC acted arbitrarily and capriciously, abused

23 its discretion, and acted in violation of its duties under the APA and other applicable California

24 law in adopting the Emergency Regulations in that, among other things, DTSC's Finding of

25 Emergency lacks facts demonstrating the existence of an emergency, and DTSC has failed to
26 demonstrate, by substantial evidence, the need for the Emergency Regulations to effectuate the

27 purpose of the HWCL, and DTSC lack authority to regulate scrap metal, including metal shredder

28 aggregate, in the first instance given that the materials processed at Petitioners' facility are not
- 38-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

I waste and thus cannot be hazardous waste. DTSC also failed to follow proper procedures and

2 abused its discretion by unilaterally rescinding OPP #88-6.

3 116. Petitioners are beneficially interested in the Emergency Regulations and in
4  reinstatement of OPP #88-6. The Emergency Regulations-and the absence of OPP #88-6

5 would require Petitioners to obtain hazardous waste facility permits under the HWCL and/or

6 undertake other regulatory applications and/or facility modifications, imposing significant costs

7 and regulatory burdens on Petitioners.

8 117. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate compelling Respondents to set aside and vacate

9 the Emergency Regulations and to reinstate OPP #88-6, which was improperly and ineffectively

10 "rescinded" by DTSC.

11 118. Petitioners have no plain and speedy or adequate remedy at law other than the

12 relief sought herein, and will be irreparably harmed if the Emergency Regulations are allowed to

13 go into effect.

14 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

15 Violation of CEQA (Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq.)

16 119. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate herein by reference the allegations of all

17 foregoing paragraphs.

18 120. CEQA and the State CEQA Guidelines, 14 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 15000 et seq.

19 ("CEQA Guidelines") require public agencies to evaluate and, if feasible, avoid or mitigate

20 potentially significant environmental impacts from public projects that they propose to carry out

21 or approve. See CEQA, § 21002.1; CEQA Guidelines, § 15002(a). CEQA "embodies a central

22 state policy to require state and local governmental entities to perform their duties," including for

23 projects undertaken by the agency itself. Union of Med. Marijuana Patients, Inc. V. City of San

24. Diego (2019) 7 Cal.5th 1171, 1184-85 (internal citations and quotations omitted). The adoption

25 of regulations, including emergency regulations, is subject to CEQA.

26 121. DTSC failed to conduct any environmental review, by improperly relying on a

27 categorical exemption from CEQA under Guidelines Section 15308 (actions by regulatory

28 agencies to "assure the maintenance, restoration, enhancement, or protection of the
- 39 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

environment"). 14 DTSC may not evade environmental review of this major regulatory change by

2 characterizing the proposed regulations as environmentally protective. See Save the Plastic Bag

3 Coalition v. County of Marin (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 209, 228. "It cannot be assumed," as

4 DTSC did here, "that activities intended to protect or preserve the environment are immune from

5 environmental review." Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 106, 119.

6 122. Given DTSC's specific intent to subject all California metal shredding facilities to

7 the requirements of the HWCL, CEQA mandates that DTSC stop and study the issues, not pre-

8 judge or ignore them by simply pointing to a categorical exemption. DTSC further failed to

9 demonstrate with substantial evidence that the exemption applies.

10 123. Furthermore, even if the categorical exemption applied to DTSC's adoption of the

11 Emergency Regulations, several exceptions to the exemption apply, including the "cumulative

12 impact" and "unusual circumstances" exceptions. See CEQA Guidelines 15300.2(b), (c). As

13 stated by Petitioners in their comments on Respondent's Notice of Exemption, DTSC ignored

14 these exceptions.

15 124. As Petitioners commented, the Emergency Regulations would have a sweeping

16 and immediate impact on metal shredding facilities, with ripple effects throughout other sectors

17 of the metals recycling industry and the State's economy at large, triggering environmental

18 impacts from construction and other impacts from facility modifications, rebuilding, or
19 retrofitting, that could be needed to meet the new requirements; increased greenhouse gas and

20 fuel emissions and increased consumption of fossil fuels in transporting scrap metal greater

21 distances; impacts from discarding and dumping of unwanted items (appliances, abandoned cars,

22 etc.); soil and groundwater contamination associated with large accumulations of scrap metal and

23 other impacts from debris piles (increased vectors, stormwater discharges). See October 20

24 Comments, at 26-27.

25 125. DTSC improperly segmented its environmental review of the Emergency

26 Regulations by ignoring these foreseeable environmental impacts of the Regulations, including

27
14
28 DTSC filed a Notice of Exemption with the Governor's Office of Policy and Research on October 26, 2021.
- 40 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

P construction activities required to comply with the Regulations and other subsequent regulatory

2 action. DTSC stated that "no construction activities are proposed with this rulemaking project;"

3 however, DTSC ignored the immediate construction activities that will be required to comply

4 with DTSC's interim status regulations. Indeed, DTSC touted the rulemaking as designed to

5 "*mitigate" purported environmental impacts and "avoid and prevent future harmful events," but

6 did not include, describe or analyze all project activities and any associated environmental

7 impacts. See NOE, at 1-2. CEQA prohibits such improper "piecemealing" of a project's

8 environmental effects. CEQA Guidelines, § 15378(a)(1) (defining "project" as the "whole of an

9 action" which "has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment,
10 or a reasonably foreseeable physical change in the environment"); Environmental Protection

11 Information Center v. California Dept. of Forestry & Fire Protection (2008) 44 Cal.4th 459, 503

12 126. Given DTSC's specific intent to subject metal shredding facilities to the
13 requirements of the HWCL, for which compliance would require completion of several multi-

14 million dollar construction projects at each of the Petitioners' facilities, DTSC was obligated to

15 evaluate any potential environmental impacts resulting from this regulatory expansion, at a

16 minimum at a programmatic level of review. DTSC violated CEQA by not proceeding to the

17 next step in the environmental review process.

18 127. By failing to conduct environmental review as required by CEQA, DTSC

19 committed t prejudicial abuse of discretion, failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and

20 failed to support its actions with substantial evidence. CEQA, § 21168.5.

21 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

22 (Injunetive Relief, Cal. Code Civ. Proc. § 526)

23 128. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate herein by reference the allegations of all
24 foregoing paragraphs.

25 129. Petitioners' metal shredding and processing operations safely and effectively

26 process the vast majority of end-of-life vehicles, appliances and light iron generated in the state.

27 If some or all of Petitioners' facilities were forced to shut down or to significantly curtail their

28 operations, the thousands of businesses in the state that rely on Petitioners' facilities to purchase
- 41 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

I and recycle their scrap metal would be severely impacted. In addition, local municipalities and

2 other governmental entities would rapidly be overwhelmed by scrap metal generated by

3 consumers and would have no outlet for those items that could be collected. While some types of

4 scrap metal (e.g., car bodies) may begin to flow out of state or to foreign countries for recycling,

5 large numbers of vehicles and many other items would remain in the state where they would be

6 abandoned or accumulate, contributing to public nuisance conditions, and posing risks to human

7 health and the environment.

8 130. Petitioners' metal shredding facilities are critical parts of the state's infrastructure

9 and enable the state to beneficially recycle the vast array of metal objects that are produced by

10 society. Unnecessary disruption or curtailment of these vital operations would cause far-ranging

11 adverse impacts and leave the state without adequate means of managing this material. Neither
12 Petitioners, their customers nor the public should be subjected to the significant environmental

13 and economic impacts that would be caused by disruption of Petitioners' metal recycling

14 operations.

15 131. As a consequence of Respondents unlawful adoption of the Emergency

16 Regulations, each of Petitioners' facilities could immediately become a nonpermitted or non-

17 conforming use under local zoning ordinances or other land use authorities, subject to significant

18 restrictions on future modifications and expansions, new local permitting requirements, fees and

19 assessments, and possibly phase-out over time, all of which will interfere severely with

20 Petitioners' ability to conduct their lawful operations.

21 132. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that the cost of

22 compliance with hazardous waste permit requirements and related regulations will vastly increase

23 current operating costs and upset the economic balance that must be maintained in order for the

24 facilities to remain in operation. Petitioners could also be required to substantially rebuild their

25 facilities, at a cost of tens of millions of dollars, in an effort to comply with hazardous waste

26 regulations. Incurrence of these additional costs will threaten the economic viability of

27 Petitioners' metal shredding facilities and could result in the shut-down and/or out-of-state

28 relocation of one or more of such facilities.
- 42 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

133. Shutdown or curtailment of Petitioners' operations would have the undesirable

2 result of encouraging illicit metal recyclers that operate without regard to applicable

3 environmental laws. By avoiding environmental regulation and the attendant costs of

4 compliance, these facilities undercut legitimate operations by offering higher prices for scrap

5 metal, depriving legitimate recyclers of critical raw materials. Petitioners are informed and

6 believe, and on that basis allege, that illicit recyclers operate without storm water permits, air

7 quality permits, hazardous materials business plans or permits, spill response and contingency

8 plans, scrap acceptance policies or other procedures designed to protect the environment and that

9 apply to Petitioners' operations.

10 134. Petitioners will suffer immediate and irreparable harm if DTSC is not enjoined

11 from enforcing the Emergency Regulations. Petitioners' facilities would be in immediate

12 violation of the interim status requirements that have become applicable as a result of the
13 Emergency Regulations, forcing them to modify or discontinue their activities and/or risk being

14 subjected to immediate penalty. Even if facility modifications are possible, they must be

15 reviewed and approved by DTC under the interim status regulations, a prolonged, public process

16 that takes many months to complete and that is antithetical to Respondents claim that subjecting

17 metal shredding facilities to the hazardous waste regulations will immediately address the

18 purported "emergency" conditions described in the Finding of Emergency.

19 135. Petitioners have no adequate remedy at law for the injuries alleged herein. Only

20 this Court's exercise of its equitable powers can protect Petitioners from sustaining irreparable

21 harm.

22 136. While injunctive relief would prevent irreparable injury to Petitioners, any

23 resulting injury to Respondents (if any at all) would be insignificant. DTSC has allowed

24 Petitioners to operate their metal shredding facilities without having to obtain hazardous waste

25 treatment permits since the advent of the state's hazardous waste management program and can

26 point to no change in the law that supports a contrary result. Petitioners' facilities are already

27 subject to numerous regulatory programs of other state, regional and local agencies, including the

28 local air quality management districts, regional water quality control boards, certified unified
. - 43 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

program agencies and local fire departments. Petitioners work closely with these regulatory

2 agencies to address any concerns that have been raised and are inspected by them on a regular

3 basis. Petitioners' facilities do not pose a threat to human health, safety or the environment.

4 137. The public interest would also be served by injunctive relief because unilateral

5 imposition of the Emergency Regulations, without input from Petitioners or any other members

6 of the metal shredding industry, would come at a collective cost of thousands of direct and

7 indirect jobs and many millions of dollars in taxes, goods and services to the state and local
8 governments. The resulting loss of jobs would cause extreme financial hardship to the affected

9 individuals, including parties throughout the scrap metal supply chain, and would propagate

10 serious effects throughout the local and state economy. On a statewide basis, total economic

11 losses could exceed hundreds of millions of dollars.

12 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

13 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for entry of judgment as follows:

14 138. For judicial declaration pursuant to Gov. Code, § 11350(a) that the facts and

15 circumstances described in DTSC's Finding of Emergency do not constitute an "emergency"
16 under the APA, that DTSC failed to comply with the requirements of the APA, including its

17 failure to provide the required economic analysis, and that the Emergency Regulations are

18 contrary to, in conflict with, and/or not reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the

19 HWCL and are thus void and without effect.

20 139. For a judicial declaration, as alleged herein, that scrap metal and metal shredder

21 aggregate are not "waste" and are not "discarded," and that metal shredder aggregate has not been

22 demonstrated to be a "hazardous waste" within the meaning of the HWCL and implementing

23 regulations when recycled at Petitioners' facilities and that adoption of the Emergency

24 Regulations was an improper and void ultra vires act.

25 140. For the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate pursuant to Code Civ. Proc.

26 0n 1085 directing DTSC to refrain from enforcing, and to set aside and vacate, the Emergency

27 Regulations and to reinstate OPP #88-6.

28

] 141. For the issuance of a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to comply

2 with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and to take any other action required by law.

3 142. For an injunction requiring DTSC to vacate and rescind the Emergency

4 Regulations, and for any other preliminary and permanent injunctive relief as appropriate

5 pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §§ 525 et seq.

6 143. For costs of suit.

7 144. For attorneys' fees as authorized by Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5 and any

8 other applicable law.

9 145. For such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.
