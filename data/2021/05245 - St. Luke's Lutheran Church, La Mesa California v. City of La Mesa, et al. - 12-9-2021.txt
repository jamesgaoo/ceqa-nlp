Notice of Related Case

ATTACHMENT 1H

St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California v. City of La Mesa; City of La Mesa City Council; City of La
Mesa Development Advisory Board, Case No. 37-2021-00022567-CU-MC-CTL, was a Petition for Writ of Mandate regarding violations of the Ralph M. Brown Act and the La Mesa Municipal Code filed on May 24, 2021 in the San Diego Superior Court - Central Division ("Brown Act Case"), making this the first-filed of the related matters.

The instant filing made on December 1, 2021, St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California v. City of La Mesa (CityMark Communities LLC, Real Party-in-Interest), Case No. TBD, regards California Environmental Quality Act, California Public Records Act, and record retention violations ("CEQA Case").
The Brown Act Case and the CEQA Case (collectively, the "Cases") involve two of the "same parties," with the Respondent City of La Mesa as the primary defendant in each action. (Cal. R. Ct. 3.300(a)(1).) Though these cases are based on wholly different and independent factual claims, and alleged violations of law, the underlying activity relates to the City of La Mesa's administration of public notification, public hearings, public records, and land-use approvals. Though consolidation of the cases is not sought, judicial economy and efficiency dictates having the same judge hear this matter in light of the likely overlap in underlying issues and parties.

ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) INFORMATION

CASE NUMBER: 37-2021-00050398-CU-WM-CTL CASE TITLE: St Lukes Lutheran Church La Mesa California vs City of La V

NOTICE: All plaintiffs/cross-complainants in a general civil case are required to serve a copy of the following a three forms on each defendant/cross-defendant, together with the complaint/cross-complaint: (1) this Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Information form (SDSC form #CIV-730),
(2) the Stipulation to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) form (SDSC form #CIV-359), and (3) the Notice of Case Assignment form (SDSC form #CIV-721).
Most civil disputes are resolved without filing a lawsuit, and most civil lawsuits are resolved a without a trial. The courts, community organizations, and private providers offer a variety of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) processes to help people resolve disputes without a trial. The San Diego Superior Court expects that litigants will utilize some form of ADR as a mechanism for case settlement before trial, and it may be beneficial to do this early in the case.
Below is some information about the potential advantages and disadvantages of ADR, the most common types of ADR, and how to find a local ADR program or neutral. A form for agreeing to use ADR is attached (SDSC form #CIV-359).
Potential Advantages and Disadvantages of ADR
ADR may have a variety of advantages or disadvantages over a trial, depending on the type of ADR process used and the
particular case:

Potential Advantages Potential Disadvantages
Saves time May take more time and money if ADR does not
Saves money
Gives parties more control over the dispute resolve the dispute

resolution process and outcome Procedures to learn about the other side's case (discovery), jury trial, appeal, and other court protections may be limited
Preserves or improves relationships or unavailable

Most Common Types of ADR
You can read more information about these ADR processes and watch videos that demonstrate them on the court's ADR webpage at http://www.sdcourt.ca.gov/adr

Mediation: A neutral person called a "mediator" helps the parties communicate in an effective and constructive manner so they can try to settle their dispute. The mediator does not decide the outcome, but helps the parties to do so. Mediation is usually confidential, and may be particularly useful when parties want or need to have an ongoing relationship, such as in disputes between family members, neighbors, co-workers, or business partners, or when parties want to discuss non-legal concerns or creative resolutions that could not be ordered at a trial.

Settlement Conference: A judge or another neutral person called a "settlement officer" helps the parties to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their case and to discuss settlement. The judge or settlement officer does not make a decision in the case but helps the parties to negotiate a settlement. Settlement conferences may be particularly helpful when the parties have very different ideas about the likely outcome of a trial and would like an experienced neutral to help guide them toward a resolution.

Arbitration: A neutral person called an "arbitrator" considers arguments and evidence presented by each side and then decides the outcome of the dispute. Arbitration is less formal than a trial, and the rules of evidence are usually relaxed. If the parties agree to binding arbitration, they waive their right to a trial and agree to accept the arbitrator's decision as final. With nonbinding arbitration, any party may reject the arbitrator's decision and request a trial. Arbitration may be appropriate when the parties want another person to decide the outcome of their dispute but would like to avoid the formality, time, and expense of trial.

SDSC CIV-730 (Rev 12-10) ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) INFORMATION Page: 1

Other ADR Processes: There are several other types of ADR which are not offered through the court but which may be obtained privately, including neutral evaluation, conciliation, fact finding, mini-trials, and summary jury trials. Sometimes parties will try a combination of ADR processes. The important thing is to try to find the type or types of ADR that are most likely to resolve your dispute. Be sure to learn about the rules of any ADR program and the qualifications of any neutral you are considering, and about their fees.

Local ADR Programs for Civil Cases

Mediation: The San Diego Superior Court maintains a Civil Mediation Panel of approved mediators who have met certain minimum qualifications and have agreed to charge $150 per hour for each of the first two (2) hours of mediation and their regular hourly rate thereafter in court-referred mediations.
On-line mediator search and selection: Go to the court's ADR webpage at www.sdcourt.ca.gov/adr and click on the "Mediator Search" to review individual mediator profiles containing detailed information about each mediator including their dispute resolution training, relevant experience, ADR specialty, education and employment history, mediation style, and fees and to submit an on-line Mediator Selection Form (SDSC form #CIV-005). The Civil Mediation Panel List, the Available Mediator List, individual Mediator Profiles, and Mediator Selection Form (CIV-005) can also be printed from the court's ADR webpage and are available at the Mediation Program Office or Civil Business Office at each court location.
Settlement Conference: The judge may order your case to a mandatory settlement conference, or voluntary settlement conferences may be requested from the court if the parties certify that: (1) settlement negotiations between the parties have been pursued, demands and offers have been tendered in good faith, and resolution has failed; (2) a judicially supervised settlement conference presents a substantial opportunity for settlement; and (3) the case has developed to a point where all parties are legally and factually prepared to present the issues for settlement consideration and further discovery for settlement purposes is not required. Refer to SDSC Local Rule 2.2.1 for more information. To schedule a settlement conference, contact the department to which your case is assigned.
Arbitration: The San Diego Superior Court maintains a panel of approved judicial arbitrators who have practiced law for a minimum of five years and who have a certain amount of trial and/or arbitration experience. Refer to SDSC Local Rules Division II, Chapter III and Code Civ. Proc. § 1141.10 et seq or contact the Arbitration Program Office at (619) 450-7300 for more information.

More information about court-connected ADR: Visit the court's ADR webpage at www.sdcourt.ca.gov/adr or contact the court's Mediation/Arbitration Office at (619) 450-7300.
Dispute Resolution Programs Act (DRPA) funded ADR Programs: The following community dispute resolution programs are funded under DRPA (Bus. and Prof. Code §§ 465 et seq.): In Central, East, and South San Diego County, contact the National Conflict Resolution Center (NCRC) at www.ncrconline.com or (619) 238-2400. In North San Diego County, contact North County Lifeline, Inc. at www.nclifeline.org or (760) 726-4900.
Private ADR: To find a private ADR program or neutral, search the Internet, your local telephone or business directory, or legal newspaper for dispute resolution, mediation, settlement, or arbitration services.
Legal Representation and Advice

To participate effectively in ADR, it is generally important to understand your legal rights and responsibilities and the likely outcomes if you went to trial. ADR neutrals are not allowed to represent or to give legal advice to the participants in the ADR process. If you do not already have an attorney, the California State Bar or your local County Bar Association can assist you in finding in an attorney. Information about obtaining free and low cost legal assistance is also available on the California courts website at www.courtinfo.ca.gov/selfhelp/lowcost.

18 Petitioner St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California (*St. Luke's") brings this Verified
19 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief against Respondent
20 City of La Mesa (the "City") for its failure to comply with the procedural and substantive requirements
21 of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"; Public Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq.) in
22 approving the demolition of the La Mesa Woman's Club ("LMWC") and the construction of a mixed 23 luse development project at 5220 Wilson Street in La Mesa, California in its place (the "Project") as
24 proposed by real party in interest, CityMark Communities LLC (the "Developer"), as well as violations
25 of the City's joint duties to retain public records (Gov. Code §§ 6200 et seq., 34090 et seq.; Pub. Res.
26 |Code § 21167.6(e); collectively, the "Record Retention Laws") and disclose public records ("CPRA";
27 Gov. Code §§ 6250 et seq.) which serve to inform the Project's true scope and the impacts it will
28 produce on the environment. ST. LUKE'S alleges as follows:
1
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM1

INTRODUCTION

2 1. Extensive evidence presented by the community, and subject matter experts, detailing
3 the Project's impacts on the environment with respect to traffic, noise, air quality, stormwater runoff,
4 public safety, and historical resources, along with internal communications amongst the City's own
5 experts acknowledging many such impacts, was summarily ignored, and the public and
6 decisionmakers were misdirected in the adoption of a California Code of Regulations, Title 14
7 ("CEQA Guidelines"), § 15332 notice of exemption (the "NOE") so that the Project could avoid
8 lenvironmental review.

2. By way of example, multiple, independent, and well-qualified experts opined that the
10 LMWC is eligible for historic designation due to, amongst other things, the organization's association
11 with events that have made a significant contribution to the history of La Mesa (e.g., the creation of
12 the Friend of the La Mesa Library organization which helped build the City's first library, housing that
13 |first La Mesa library within the LMWC, and extensive campaigns to support World War I efforts and
14 |to incorporate the City), the distinctive Modern Contemporary character of the LMWC indicative of
15 (that specific type, period, and method of construction, that the LMWC was the last work of the notable
16 architect, Herluf Brydegaard, whose architecture has previously been deemed historic and is notable
17 due to its high artistic values, and the LMWC's association with the lives of persons of significance in
18 La Mesa's past. Moreover, these same experts opined that the Developer's historical analysis was
19 fatally deficient in that it noted some of the LMWC's historical characteristics but dismissed them as
20 unworthy of preservation without reasoned basis. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5 ["The inquiry in such a
21 case shall extend to the questions whether the respondent has proceeded without, or in excess of,
22 jurisdiction; whether there was a fair trial; and whether there was any prejudicial abuse of discretion.
23 Abuse of discretion is established if the respondent has not proceeded in the manner required by law,
24 the order or decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the
25 evidence."].)

26 3. Compounding matters, the City's own experts repeatedly opined that the LMWC is
27 eligible for historic preservation, and then prepared, and transmitted to the Developer, extensive
28 documentation relating to the historic aspects of the site. But, when asked to provide this same
2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM2

information to the Petitioner, the City claimed this documentation longer existed - in direct violation
2 of its requirements to retain and/or disclose such records so that the public and decisionmakers have
linformation relevant to the Project's scope and impacts on the environment. (Sierra Club v. County of
4 Fresno (2018) 6 Cal.5th 502, 515 ['failure to comply with the law subverts the purposes of CEQA"
and constitutes prejudicial error "if it omits material necessary to informed decisionmaking and
6 linformed public participation"]; Golden Door Properties LLC v. Sup. Ct. (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 733,
7 790 [disclosure of records relating to a development to developer require disclosure to the public].)
8 4. Further, upon learning that Petitioner sought, and recovered, the City's own
9 communications decrying the Project's impacts on the environment, Respondent changed its tack by
10 denying Petitioner the disclosure of internal correspondence in preparation of staff reports, arguing
11 that it was not required to retain such public records in direct violation of its duties under CEQA, the
12 CPRA, and the Record Retention Laws. "[I]f the manner in which an agency failed to follow the law
13 is shown to be prejudicial, or is presumptively prejudicial, as when the department or the board fails
14 to comply with mandatory procedures, ...the decision [must] be set aside ..." .... (Sierra Club v. State Bd.
15 of Forestry (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1215, 1236.)

16 5. The Project's baseline conditions were inaccurately described as well. For instance,
17 the Community Development Director and the Developer's traffic consultant both claimed, without
18 evidence in the record, that the intersection fronting the proposed development, at Wilson Street and
19 Grossmont Boulevard was safe and had only experienced one (1) vehicular accident in recent history.
20 Notwithstanding the fact that Petitioner presented the City's own police reports reflecting four (4) such
21 accidents, and the concerns raised by the community members most familiar with this intersection's
22 hazards, as well as the City staff's internal communications recommending further analysis and
23 mitigation measures, the City abused its discretion by turning a blind eye to the Project's exacerbation
24 of an already dangerous condition. In furtherance of this point, the subject intersection at Wilson Street
25 and Grossmont Boulevard suffered another serious vehicular accident on November 19, 2021, soon
26 lafter the City claimed no concern for increasing the traffic intensity in this location without considered
27 analysis. (Exhibit A - Photographs of vehicles involved in the Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street
28 lintersection traffic accident which occurred at approximately 11 AM on November 19, 2021.) The
3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM3

1 City's blatant disregard for this dangerous condition, and the impacts which will be generated by the
2 lproposed Project's residents, guests, commercial tenants, and customers is a clear and prejudicial abuse
3 of discretion. The Legislature declares that it is the policy of this state to "take all action necessary to
4 protect, rehabilitate, and enhance the environmental quality of the state." [Citation.] [Citation.] (Id. at
5 p. 1229.)

6. It is not only the public which has been harmed by the City's failures to follow the law
- its own decisionmakers have been bamboozled by staff who patently misrepresent the facts, as noted
8 above, and alter them when inconvenient. The City's Design Review Board ("DRB"), which board
9 Iconsists of land use, planning and architectural experts, critically reviewed the Project's proposed
10 street improvements indicating concerns over its public safety impacts. When the DRB boardmembers
11 determined a traffic analysis was necessary to identify street improvements to mitigate the Project's
12 impacts, City staff made efforts to blunt the condition (since this would clearly indicate that a CEQA
13 lexemption could not be granted). First, staff unlawfully claimed the traffic analysis could be provided
14 after the NOE was adopted, at the "construction drawing" stage - in clear violation of CEQA's
15 prohibition against deferred environmental analysis. (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com.
16 (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 134 [CEQA's "substantive mandate [requires] that public agencies refrain from
17 approving projects for which there are feasible alternatives or mitigation measures," and that an agency
18 not approve a project for which significant environmental effects have been identified unless the
19 agency makes specific findings about alternatives and mitigation measures.) Then, upon the DRB's
20 imposition of this traffic analysis condition, in an astonishingly brazen move, City staff surreptitiously
21 eliminated this traffic analysis condition altogether when presenting the DRB's conditional approval
22 to the La Mesa Planning Commission and Council, and falsely denied the existence of said condition
23 when raised by Petitioner. City staff had no authority to countermand the DRB's conditional approval.
24 Nor can there be any legitimate basis justifying such willful misinformation to decisionmakers and the
25 public. The resulting a process was not a fair or legitimate adjudication of the facts underlying the
26 Project.

27 7. Further, the City's ham-handed efforts to avoid CEQA analysis by use of the NOE are
28 clearly evident in that the Project was in fact conditioned to (1) construct crosswalk improvements and
4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM4

(2) make a five thousand dollar ($5,000) contribution towards unspecified future improvements at the
2 lintersection of Wilson Street and Grossmont Boulevard. Such mitigation measures are plainly
3 indicative of the fact the Project will generate impacts requiring ameliorative action. Yet, when
4 presented with this point, the City staff falsely claimed the Developer "volunteered" to provide these
(things, rather than being required by the City to do so. This dissembling was exposed, and presented
6 to both Planning Commission and City Council, through the staff's internal correspondence plainly
7 discussing a desire to impose cach of these conditions on the Developer to mitigate the Project's
8 impacts. Once again, the facts were blatantly ignored. No rational developer would simply volunteer
9 to give money to the City unless required for approval of its for-profit business venture. Nor can the
10 City point to any fund, or approved fee schedule, previously established by the Council dictating that
11 la five thousand dollars ($5,000) contribution to be a "standard condition" of a development of this
12 nature. Rather, putting the facts, the staff's own words, and common sense aside, the City prejudicially
13 abused its discretion by approving these mitigation measures on the Project and simultaneously
14 claiming no CEQA review was required.

15 8. Though the Project is proposed directly next door to an elementary school, and across
16 the street from an exclusively senior residential community, no effort was made to investigate the
17 impacts of the construction noise, and/or air quality, impacts. Instead, the City relies upon its "standard
18 conditions" to mitigate the Project's expected impacts in these categories. But this argument makes
19 Little sense. For instance, the City's noise ordinance only restricts noise levels at night (between 10
7 20|p.m. and 7 a.m.), but the elementary school is only open for instruction in the daytime, such that no
21 limitations exist with respect to the construction noise arising from grading almost ninety percent
22 (90%) of a nearly one (1) acre site. The City has no substantial evidence upon which to rely that the
23 construction noise associated approximately one thousand eight hundred (1,800) cubic yards of
24 grading operations, along with the heavy trucks required to haul dirt to and from the site, will not pose
la 25 la significant noise impact on these sensitive receptors. What is evident is that the proximal school site
26 will be forced to absorb the noise and dust from the construction of the Project, especially in light of
27 the now commonly understood need for good air circulation arising from the COVID-19 pandemic,
28 requiring classrooms to open their windows to lessen viral circulation. Again, the City turned a blind

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM5

leye, and prejudicially abused its discretion without substantial evidence to support its position.

9. These and other violations of law detailed in extensive written and oral presentations to
the City have all been summarily ignored in the adoption of the NOE, resulting in serious and
4 prejudicial errors which this Court must now remedy by directing the City to provide the Petitioner,
5 the public, and the City's decisionmakers, all necessary and accurate information to conclude the true
6 scope of the Project and its impacts, and to require the preparation of an environmental impact report
7 ("EIR"). (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 113 [*Whenever
8 la a project may have a significant and adverse physical effect on the environment, an EIR must be
9 prepared and certified. [Citations.]"].)

10 THE PARTIES

11 10. At all relevant times mentioned herein, Petitioner is a California non-stock corporation
12 operating as a religious institution at 5150 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California, and its property includes
13 an elementary school (pre-kindergarten through fifth grade) onsite known as the Warren Walker La
14 Mesa Lower School.

15 11. Petitioner, like much of the public, is concerned about the City's failure to observe and
16 abide by the laws intended to protect the community from unmitigated impacts arising from the
17 Project's development. Accordingly, St. Luke's has a direct and beneficial interest in the City's
18 compliance with CEQA, the CPRA, and the Record Retention Laws.

19 12. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondent is a
20 municipality organized under the laws of the State of California and has general land use authority
21 over the Project site, is responsible for reviewing entitlement requests for the Project, and approving
22 or denying such requests.

23 13. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondent functions as
24 the "lead agency" under CEQA for purposes of assessing the Project for environmental impacts and
25 disclosing that assessment to the public, and as the lead agency Respondent must comply with the
26 procedural and substantive requirements of CEQA.

27 14. Petitioner is further informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondent is
28 F*local agency" under the CPRA and as a local agency is required to permit the inspection, or provide

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM6

Icopies, of identifiable public records upon request by Petitioner.

2 15. Petitioner is further informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondent is a
3 city, and that the Respondent is subject to the Record Retention Laws.

4 16. Petitioner is further informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Developer is a
5 limited liability company organized and existing under the laws of the State of California, and is
6 lidentified as the applicant for the Project, and the NOE, approved and/or adopted by the Respondent
7 and challenged by this lawsuit.

8 17. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents and/or Real
9 Parties in Interest fictitiously named herein as Does 1 through 20, inclusive, and is unaware of any
10 other parties required to be named under applicable law. Petitioner will amend this petition and
11 complaint, with leave of the Court, if necessary, to allege the fictitiously named parties' true names
12 land capacities if ascertained.

13 JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND STANDING
14 18. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged herein pursuant to Code of Civil
15 Procedure §§ 1060, 1085, and 1094.5; Government Code §§ 6203, 6258, and 6259; Public Resources
16 Code §§ 21168 and 21168.5.

17 19. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing the instant lawsuit, including
18 but not limited to, exhausting all administrative remedies by objecting to the City's violations of CEQA
19 and making all administrative appeals of such legislative bodies having authority over the Project.
20 20. Petitioner has also requested public records from the City under the CPRA, and has
21 been unlawfully denied the right to inspect, and or to be provided with copies of, certain records
22 without legitimate basis.

23 21. Petitioner is further excused from any conditions precedent to filing the instant lawsuit,
24 lif any exist, by futility, lack of jurisdiction, and/or the unavailability of any other timely review,
25 including without limitation the failure of the City to provide timely public notice, public hearings, or
26 other proceedings.

27 22. Venue is proper in this Court because all known parties to this lawsuit are located within
28 the County of San Diego County and the alleged violations occurred in the County of San Diego.
7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM7

23. Petitioner has standing to assert its claims because it has a material interest in the
2 Project's impacts on the environment as they relate to the neighboring community, and in ensuring
3 that the City abides by the laws of the State of California in providing transparency in its governance
4 of this community, by and through its retention and disclosure of public records.

vote but conditioned the Project based upon several requirements including, but not limited to, the
6 preparation of traffic study to be provided well after environmental review had concluded.

31. On March 16, 2021, St. Luke's, through its counsel, requested additional public records
8 relating to the Project through the CPRA. A true and correct copy of St. Luke's March 16, 2021 CPRA
9 request is attached hereto as Exhibit H.

10 32. On March 17, 2021, St. Luke's submitted its timely appeal of the Development
11 Advisory Board's approval of the Project. A true and copy of St. Luke's written appeal is attached
12 hereto as Exhibit and its content is fully incorporated by reference as though set forth herein in its

6 appeal of the March 8. 2021 Development Advisory Board's determination to approve the Project and
7 adopt the NOE. St. Luke's objected to the Project's approval and the NOE in a writing delivered prior
8 to said public hearing, and additional objections were presented orally on Petitioner's behalf during
9 the course of said hearing. City staff and the City's legal counsel directed the Planning Commissioners
10 that they could not deny the Project, or the adoption of the NOE based upon, amongst other things, the
11 development's impacts on historical resources (that is, the LMWC) notwithstanding multiple subject
12 Imatter experts offering substantial evidence and opining on this point prior to, and during, the public
13 hearing. Instead, Planning Commissioners were directed that could only rely upon the Developer's
14 historical analysis. Thereafter, the Planning Commission voted unanimously to deny the Project and
15 to uphold the Project's approval as well as the adoption of the NOE. A true and correct copy of St.
16 Luke's written objections is attached hereto as Exhibit O and its content is fully incorporated by
17 reference as though set forth herein in its entirety.
18 39. On July 27, 2021, St. Luke's submitted a CPRA request to the City for public records
19 relating to the Project. A true and correct copy of that CPRA request is attached hereto as Exhibit P
20 40. On or about August 3, 2021, St. Luke's submitted its timely appeal of the Planning
21 Commission's July 21, 2021 determination on the Project and NOE. A true and correct copy of St.
22 Luke's appeal is attached hereto as Exhibit Q and its content is fully incorporated by reference as
23 though set forth herein in its entirety.

24 41. On August 9, 2021, the City replied to St. Luke's July 27, 2021 CPRA request
25 indicating it required additional time due to unusual circumstances, but estimated production of the
26 responsive records would be made by August 23, 2021. A true and correct copy of the City's August
279, 2021 cover letter is attached hereto as Exhibit R.

28 42. On August 23, 2021, the City replied, via email, to St. Luke's July 27, 2021 CPRA

11 the record production, including Project-related staff reports and internal communications, public
12 comments, and historical resource records regarding the LMWC previously provided to the Developer
13 and/or its agent(s). A true and correct copy of St. Luke's October 6, 2021 email requesting follow up
14 on the July 27, 2021 CPRA request is attached hereto as Exhibit U.

15 45. On October 18, 2021, the City responded, via email, to St. Luke's October 6, 2021
16 CPRA follow up request, providing several responsive records but indicating that some staff
17 communications and reports were "drafts that no longer exist" and that the LMWC historic resource
18 records previously provided to the Developer and/or its agent(s) could not be found. A true and correct
19 copy of the City's October 18, 2021 email is attached hereto as Exhibit V.
20 46. Thereafter, between October 18, 2021 and October 20, 2021, St. Luke's and the City
21 corresponded with one another, via email, regarding the City's missing staff communications and
22 reports, and the LMWC historic resource records failed to produce to Petitioner but made available to
23 the Developer and/or its agents. The City stopped providing responses on this topic when asked
24 directly if the historic resource records were not retained. At no time previously, or thereafter, did the
25 City provide the referenced staff communications and reports, or the LMWC historic resource records
26 provided to the Developer and/or its agent. A true and correct copy of said email exchange between
27 St. Luke's and the City is attached hereto as Exhibit W.
28 47. On October 26, 2021, the City Council for the City heard St. Luke's appeal of the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM11

Planning Commission's July 21, 2021 determination to uphold the Development Advisory Board's
2 March 8, 2021 approval of the Project and adoption of the NOE. St. Luke's objected to the Project's
3 approval and the NOE in a writing delivered prior to said public hearing, and additional objections
4 were presented orally on Petitioner's behalf during the course of said hearing. The Council denied St.
5 Luke's appeal and approved the Project and adoption of the NOE on a 3 to a 1 vote. A true and correct
6 copy of St. Luke's written objections is attached hereto as Exhibit X and its content is fully
7 lincorporated by reference as though set forth herein in its entirety.

8 48. On October 27, 2021, the City filed the NOE with the County of San Diego. A true and
9 correct copy of the filed NOE is attached hereto as Exhibit Y.

10 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (VIOLATION OF CEQA)

12 49. St. Luke's realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 48 above, as
13 though set forth herein in their entirety.

14 50. An actual and justiciable controversy has arisen and now exists between Petitioner and
15 the City concerning the adoption of the NOE resulting in the Project's exemption from CEQA review.
16 51. Though perfection is not required of the City, CEQA exemptions may not be exploited
17 to avoid environmental analysis by ignoring substantial evidence reflecting clear and undeniable
18 exceptions to the NOE in light of the Project's significant impacts with respect to traffic, noise, air
19 quality, stormwater runoff, public safety, and historical resources.

20 52. The City's failure or refusal to disclose public records relevant to the significant effects
21 of the Project violates CEQA by limiting the public's, and decisionmakers' understanding of the
22 Project's true scope, baseline, and/or impacts resulting in a prejudicial abuse of discretion improperly
23 favoring circumvention of environmental review.

24 53. The City's unlawful reliance upon mitigation measures it imposed to limit traffic and
25 public safety impacts does not justify the grant of exemption from CEQA review. Rather, such
26 mitigation measures indicate the Project does, in fact, generate impacts which the City has implicitly
27 determined require amelioration. Thus, the NOE is illegitimate in light of the Project's recognized
28 limpacts with respect to traffic and public safety.
12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM12

54. The DRB conditioned its approval of the Project by requiring the preparation of a traffic
2 study. a Such a condition acknowledges the development's potentially significant impacts on public
3 safety and traffic in light of the Project's increase use of a roadway recognized as impaired. In SO
4 doing, the City tacitly admits the NOE cannot be granted in light of the Project's significant impacts
5 on the environment. Moreover, the DRB was misdirected to require this traffic study condition well
6 past the conclusion of the CEQA process, resulting in an unlawful deferred analysis of the Project's
7 impacts in further violation of the law. The City's efforts to then avoid the consequences of this
8 unlawful deferment, wherein its staff unilaterally altered the legislative body's determination by
9 altogether striking this traffic study condition (and then falsely testifying the condition did not exist)
10 only serves to highlight the impropriety of granting the NOE and puts into question the credibility of
11 all other claims made by the City with respect to the Project's impacts on the environment.
12 55. The City also failed to consider the Project's effects on sensitive receptors. Instead, the
13 City improperly relies upon plainly ineffective standards which do nothing to mitigate the noise and
14 air quality/dust impacts resulting from the proposed construction on school children and senior citizens
15 proximate to the subject site without consideration of appropriate mitigation measures to alleviate such
16 imminently distressful conditions.

17 56. The public interest in resolving the controversy is substantial. The public has a
18 significant interest in ensuring the City properly analyze the Project's environmental impacts and direct
19 proper mitigation measures accordingly.
20 57. Writ relief is required to correct the City's abuses of discretion resulting in violations
21 of CEQA.

22 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (DECLARATORY RELIEF)
24 58. St. Luke's realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 57 above, as
25 though set forth herein in their entirety.

26 59. An actual and justiciable controversy has arisen between Petitioner and the City
27 concerning their respective rights and duties.

28 60. St. Luke's contends the City erred when it approved the Project and adopted the NOE
13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM13

1 las described heretofore.

2 61. St. Luke's is informed and believe, and on that basis alleges, the City disputes
2 /Petitioner's contentions and instead maintains the Project and NOE were lawfully approved and/or
4 adopted.

5 62. St. Luke's seeks a judicial determination concerning the rights and duties of the parties
6 lin the controversy alleged.

63. Such a determination is necessary and appropriate at this time so that the parties may
8 plan and determine their actions accordingly.

9 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AS TO CEQA CLAIMS)
11 64. St. Luke's realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 63 above, as
12 though set forth herein in their entirety.

13 65. St. Luke's seeks a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent injunction
14 to enjoin the City from continuing to implement the Project without adequate environmental review as
15 required by CEQA.

16 66. St. Luke's further seeks a temporary restraining order, preliminary and permanent
17 injunction compelling and ordering the City to comply with CEQA in implementing the Project.
18 67. St. Luke's is likely to prevail on the merits and establish that the City, by its actions
19 violated CEQA, as alleged herein.

20 68. Unless enjoined and restrained, the City will continue to implement the Project without
21 adequate environmental review as required by CEQA.

22 69. St. Luke's has no adequate remedy at law to prevent the unlawful implementation of
23 the Project in its current state.

24 70. In the event the Project is implemented without proper environmental review, St.
25 Luke's, and the public generally, will sustain damages that are impossible to determine. The
26 environment itself will likewise suffer.

27 71. If the Project is allowed to proceed, Petitioner's claims for relief may become moot.
28 72. Further, the actions of the City may result in a multiplicity of lawsuits unless enjoined.
14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM14

73. For these reasons, injunctive relief as to the City's violations of CEQA is appropriate
2 in this case.

FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

4 (VIOLATION OF THE CPRA)
74. St. Luke's realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 73 above, as
6 though set forth herein in their entirety.

7 75. The City withholds, delays, obstructs, and/or otherwise denies to St. Luke's the right to
8 inspect, and/or receive copies of, extensive public records including, but not limited to, those
9 describing the LMWC as a historical resource and staff reports and/or communications relating to such
10 staff reports regarding the Project.

11 76. Such public records were prepared, owned, used, and/or retained by the City, and are
12 owed to the public, including St. Luke's, upon request under the CPRA.

13 77. The City has a clear, present ministerial duty to properly respond to CPRA requests and
14 has no legitimate claim to any CPRA exemptions with respect to said public records requested by St.
15 Luke's. Nor may the City claim any CPRA exemption as to those public records which it has
16 previously disclosed to others, as it did with it respect to certain materials requested by St. Luke's.
17 78. The City failed to comply with its mandated duties under the CPRA to promptly
18 disclose identifiable public records requested by St. Luke's unlawfully limiting the public
19 understanding as to how the City conduct's the people's business with respect to the Project.
20 79. The City's failure to perform its duties under the CPRA as described is an abuse of
21 discretion correctable by writ, declaratory, and injunctive relief.
22 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (UNLAWFUL DESTRUCTION OF PUBLIC RECORDS)
24 80. St. Luke's realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 79 above, as
25 though set forth herein in their entirety.
26 81. The Legislature clearly intended public agencies, like the City, to retain the eleven
27 categories of documents enumerated in Public Resources Code § 21167.6(e) in order to fulfill the
28 obligations and rights set forth in Public Resources Code § 21167.6(b).
15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM15

82. Public records that meet the criteria set forth in Public Resources Code § 21167.6(e)
2 are required by law to be retained pursuant to Government Code § 6200 and 34090(c)-(d).
3 83. St. Luke's, upon information and belief, alleges that the City has not retained those
4 records it is required to retain under Public Resources Code § 21167.6(e) and has instead improperly
5 destroyed or otherwise tampered with such records resulting in an improper pattern and practice of
6 Iviolation of the law.

7 84. St. Luke's, upon information and belief, alleges City staff engage in an improper pattern
8 and practice of failing to properly screen and retain public records for preservation in violation state
9 law resulting in the unlawful destruction of public records including, but not necessarily limited to
10 those relating to the Project.

11 85. The City has a clear, present ministerial duty to retain public records required under
12 Public Records Code § 21167.6(e).

13 86. The City failed to comply with its mandated duty to retain public records a in a manner
14 which resulted in detriment to St. Luke's, and the public, resulting in unlawfully limiting an accurate
15 understanding of the Project's scope, baseline, and/or impacts.
16 87. The City's failure to perform its duties to retain such public records is an abuse of
17 discretion correctable by writ, declaratory, and injunctive relief

Re: Project No. 2020-16 (CityMark Communities LLC) - 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, CA

Dear Ms. Kinnard:

This law firm represents the St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California located at
5150 Wilson Street, directly adjacent to the La Mesa Woman's Club ("LMWC"), the site of a 49
residential unit and three commercial unit mixed-use project ("Project") proposed by CityMark Communities LLC ("CityMark") known as Project No. 2020-16. This correspondence is offered to inform the City of La Mesa ("City") of our client's grave concerns regarding the proposed Project, the limited conditions recommended to ensure the health and safety of the public, and the apparent lack of analysis of the Project's expected impacts.
We also wish to bring to the City's attention that on December 17, 2020 this firm requested to be placed on the notice list for all public hearings relating to the Project, and specifically those relating to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Notwithstanding this, we were only sent notice of the March 8, 2021, 12:30 p.m. Design Review Board ("DRB") meeting after regular work hours, at 8:10 p.m., on Thursday, March 4, 2021 (see Attachment "1"), indicating that the City requires audio/visual presentations by the public to be submitted by "12:00 noon, one business day prior to the start of the meeting." It would be practically impossible to prepare and transmit any presentation, let alone a thoughtful one, within three regular working hours of receipt of said notice (i.e., after 9 a.m. on March 5, 2021) to comply with the City's stated deadline. What is more, no notice was sent to this office of the March 8, 2021, 10 a.m. Development Advisory Board ("DAB") meeting though we understand that an exemption to CEQA analysis is to be voted on in this hearing. In fact, it is solely due to our client's diligence in searching the City's website, at approximately 11:15 am on March 5, 2021, that we learned of the DAB meeting at all - again, making it impossible to provide the City with an audio/visual presentation by the 12:00 noon
deadline set for that same day.
We understand that COVID-19 has altered the conditions by which we all live and work, and that the City is permitted to avoid direct communications from the public during such hearings

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV

in light of California Executive Order N-29-20. Yet, the failure to afford the public a practical
opportunity to review, analyze, and respond to the Project's 137-page DRB staff report and the 150-page DAB staff report does not comport with the public's statutory and constitutional rights to petition its government under the Ralph M. Brown Act. (Government Code 54950 et seq.; Cal.
Const., Art. I § 3, subd. (a) and (b)(1), (7).) These actions run afoul of the law as they present
limitations on public participation which are simply "too arbitrary and capricious, too restrictive and unreasonable." (Nevens v. Chino (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 775, 778; see also Robins v. Pruneyard Shopping Center (1979) 23 Cal.3d 899, 907 [The right of the people to petition the government for redress of grievances is "vital to a basic process in the state's constitutional
scheme."].)
Furthermore, should CityMark, or its consultants, be permitted to present audio/visual materials to, or communicate directly with, the DAB or DRB boards during these hearings on March 8, 2021 it will only heighten the inequities inherent in providing late, or no, notice to the public, with regard to the respective rights of the parties to petition their government. This would be an unfortunate, and likely unlawful, action in unequal treatment under both state and federal
statutes and constitutions. A more reasoned action would be to postpone each of the DAB and
DRB hearings by a week, or more, to permit each party, and the public more generally, an
opportunity to present their positions thoughtfully.
Notwithstanding this, we offer a limited summary of our client's position with respect to
the proposed Project in the hopes that it will be presented to the DAB and DRB board members for review prior to any discussion of, or determination on, this matter. In light of the severely
constrained time available to us before the DAB and DRB meetings, we will not reiterate each of the points made in prior communications and correspondence delivered to the City in opposition to the Project but join in those comments by this reference. Rather, we will focus briefly on the inadequate analysis of the Project in light of the City's General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, the Project's inapt use of California State Density Bonus Law (Gov. Code § 65915 et seq.) waivérs, and the impropriety of the claimed CEQA exemption under Guidelines section 15332.

I. The Project Runs Afoul Of The General Plan's Urban Design Element And The Zoning Ordinance
As the staff reports to each of the DAB and DRB indicate, the Project site is designated as
"Mixed Use Urban," corresponding to the Mixed Use (MU) Overlay, in the Residential Business
base zone and is intended to support "pedestrian friendly housing." (DAB Staff Report, p. 2; DRB Staff Report, p.2.) Notwithstanding this, the Project seeks to avoid the very features it is obligated to provide to enable pedestrian-friendly housing.

PWM54

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
March 8, 2021

The Project sits under 100 feet away, directly across Grossmont Boulevard, from the Grossmont Shopping Center. The closest supermarket to the Project is the Walmart Neighborhood Market therein, lying approximately 350 feet away, yet because there is no crosswalk, stop sign, and/or traffic signal at the intersection of Wilson Street and Grossmont Boulevard, a resident of
the Project would be required to walk about three-quarters of a mile to safely cross the street, pick up groceries, and return with them - it is doubtful many residents will be able to lug an average family's weekly groceries this distance, on foot. (DAB Staff Report, p. 2 [In fact, the City recognizes this failing at the beginning of its report, "The intersection is not signalized and is lacking curb ramps and crosswalks."]; see also DRB Staff Report at p. 2 for the same
acknowledgment of a dangerous condition].) Notwithstanding this, it appears the Project is being
permitted to avoid the development of a crosswalk which is absolutely necessary for its residents
or, at least, providing an analysis showing the Project will generate significantly more average daily vehicular trips and vehicle miles traveled than contemplated.
The City failed to require a traffic analysis for the Project, though it initially sought to require an ADA-compliant ramp be constructed at this intersection before apparently dropping this condition altogether. Our client's environmental consultant has also indicated this intersection is particularly dangerous because of limited sightlines arising from a substantial curve in Grossmont Boulevard in this area. The observation that this particular intersection is dangerous has been
voiced numerous times in correspondence submitted to the City by multiple parties. Yet the staff reports show that no ramp, crosswalk, or analysis was required of the Project - instead, the Project is conditioned to provide a $5,000 "fair-share" payment toward a ramp to be built by an unknown party at an unknown time in the future. This does not comport with the law.
There appears to be no plan on file to develop a safe intersection at Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street, and the $5,000 payment does not appear to go towards any previously approved
fund for that purpose. Nor is there any indication of how this figure was calculated. In Anderson First Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173, the appellate court held that paying a "fair-share fee" is permissible as effective mitigation only if the fees are "part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency commits itself to implementing." That is not the case in this instance. In light of this, the City must require the installation of an appropriately signalized intersection, or some other traffic calming feature here, or require the Project to present an analysis indicating why it should not do so. The only evidence in the administrative record, to date, on this topic shows that the City initially desired a crosswalk to be
installed but backed off without explanation (or analysis available to the public, or the City's
decisionmakers).

"In MU areas, new development is required to include pedestrian realm improvements along collector streets to encourage pedestrian activity. The Circulation Element classifies Grossmont Boulevard as a major collector street subject to pedestrian realm requirements." (DAB
Staff Report, p. 2; DRB Staff Report, p. 2. [Emphasis added.]; see also La Mesa Municipal Code

PWM55

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard

24.18.040(B).) The condition to pay a fee in lieu of an actual mitigation measure regarding a known project impact runs afoul of CEQA and should not be permitted. Rather the Project must be required to perform an analysis to determine the scope of the impact and to then propose a mitigation measure to reduce that impact to a less than significant level.
Moreover, this mitigation measure is improper on two other bases. First, it improperly attempts to defer mitigation until a later (and, in this case, unknown future) time. This is specifically forbidden under CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4 (a)(1)(B).) And second, a mitigation
measure is only available if a project under CEQA is expected to generate a potentially significant impact on the environment, but the staff report indicates that the Project is exempt from CEQA because there are no such expected impacts. (DAB Staff Report, p. 7-8; see also DAB Staff Report, Attachment A, "Resolution No. DAB-2021-xx" at Par. 1.) So, either the Project is not exempt from CEQA and cannot be conditioned to mitigate a potentially significant impact, or it must be analyzed properly under CEQA (i.e., by preparation of an Initial Study, followed by specific impact category studies, and the development of a mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report). The status quo does not comport with the law. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network V. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102 [a public agency may not adopt mitigation measures for a project for the purpose of qualifying it for a categorical CEQA exemption; see also Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster
(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1200.)
A. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Limited To Overcoming Physical, Not Financial, Constraints Such That Avoiding Improvements To The Pedestrian Realm Are Not
Permitted For This Project

As indicated above, the Project is designated Mixed Use Urban requiring improvements to
the surrounding pedestrian realm. LMMC § 24.18.020(E) defines the term "pedestrian realm" as
follows:

"Pedestrian realm" means a twelve-foot wide area located between the face of the
curb of a Circulation Element designated street and the face of the building. The pedestrian realm includes the parkway, sidewalk, and landscaped areas. The
pedestrian realm may include both public and private property where the public right-of-way is not twelve feet wide. Pedestrian amenities, street trees, street
furniture, bus stop facilities, and other landscaping, as specified in this chapter,
shall be included in the public realm.
Notwithstanding this acknowledged requirement, "[w]aivers are being requested to allow reductions in... pedestrian realm requirements." (DAB Staff Report, p. 3; DRB Staff Report, p. 3.) For instance, the Project seeks a "waiver" under the State Density Bonus Law so that it may
encroach four feet into the pedestrian realm along Grossmont Boulevard by installing balconies hanging over this right of way. This miscomprehends what a waiver is under the law.

PWM56

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
March 8, 2021
Page 5 of 13

Pursuant to Government Code §65915(e)(1), waivers (as opposed to incentives) are afforded to a density bonus project only when a "development standard will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development," not because the developer desires it, or because it will enhance the financial prospects of a project. Put another way, a waiver permits deviation from, or altogether evasion of, regulations which affect : project due to its site-specific physical features. This subject site has no such physical constraints. Rather, the balconies could be built outside of the pedestrian realm (i.e., within the building envelope) by moving the exterior walls along Grossmont Boulevard back four feet, or removed altogether. The applicant itself makes clear that it is not a physical constraint that drives this waiver request when it states its justification as follows:

This waiver is requested due to excessive space and cost impacts to incorporate the
Open Space requirement and private balconies. The loss of development potential to incorporate this would make the project infeasible to provide the affordable units.
As mentioned above, the site itself does not have any physical obstruction which precludes construction of these balconies, rather CityMark simply desires to have them overhang the pedestrian realm because it would increase their financial incentive to develop the Project. The State Density Bonus Law permits this sort of deviation from regulation for financial gain through the use of incentives, of which the Project has two (waivers, on the other hand, are unlimited for such developments). Yet, the Project avoids using any of its incentives and instead improperly requests at least five waivers to avoid its open space requirements, building height limit, parking space sizing, landscaping required within the pedestrian realm, and overall parking requirements. In each such instance, CityMark indicates that the justification for the waiver is not a physical constraint unique to the site but rather the request is made to seek a financial boon for the
developer.

The reason the Project seeks to use waivers rather than incentives is clear on its face - the State Density Bonus Law does not authorize a sufficient number of incentives (i.e., the Project requires five, but only has two available to it) to meet CityMark's desired financial goals, whereas it may request an unlimited number of waivers. Because it does not have sufficient incentives to develop the Project in this manner, it attempts to avoid their use altogether and instead make faulty justifications for waivers which are impermissible under the law.
Because a CityMark cannot show a physical constraint exists which limits the development of the Project under the City's laws and policies, it must use its incentives (and justify the use of those incentives by showing the financial benefit gained thereby) and/or redesign the Project to be in conformity with the law.

B. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Not Permitted To Overcome Regulations That Pertain To Health And Safety
As mentioned above, the Project's requests for waivers are inapposite to the law because they pertain to financial rather than physical constraints. In addition, the Project improperly seeks to waive the City's standard parking space and driving aisle dimensions even though this would result in direct health and safety impacts. Waivers are impermissible on this basis as well.

The dimensions of parking spaces and adjacent driving aisles are specified to ensure the safety of vehicles, their drivers and passengers, and pedestrians. (LMMC § 22.112.010(B).) This makes common sense - if spaces and driving aisles are too small, or otherwise constrained, they are likelier to lead to physical harm from other vehicles when vacating or entering a space and are the reason why State building codes requires minimum parking dimensions to ensure health and safety. (DAB Staff Report, p. 3 & Attachment D, pp. 3-4; DRB Staff Report, p. 3 & Attachment E, pp. 3-4.)

Government Code section 65915(e)(1) of the State Density Bonus Law provides:
Nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted to require a local government to waive or reduce development standards if the waiver or reduction would have a specific, adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5, upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact. [Emphasis added.]
Thus, a waiver cannot be used to avoid the specific, adverse impact arising from the reduction of a basic safety feature inherent in parking stall/space sizes and driving aisle dimensions as contemplated by the Project due to the health and safety issues it raises. No justification exists which would be sufficient to overcome this requested reduction in health and safety standards, nor would an incentive permit such a thing.
C. The Project, As Designed, Is Contrary To The Chief Land Use Policies Declared Under
The Land Use And Urban Design Element Of The General Plan
California law requires each city and county to adopt a general plan, a comprehensive long- term plan for the development of that city or county, famously referred to by the state Supreme
Court as the "constitution for future development." (Lesher Communications, Inc. v. Cityof Walnut Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 540.) A general plan must contain seven mandatory "elements," including a "land use element" to designate the level of intensity and general distribution of land uses. (Gov. Code § 65302.) "[T]he propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development depends upon [a finding of] consistency with the applicable general plan and its

PWM58

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
March 8, 2021
Page 7 of 13

elements." (Resource Defense Fund v. County of Santa Cruz (1982) 133 Cal.App.3rd 800, 806.) CEQA imposes an obligation on La Mesa to assess the Project's consistency with the City's General Plan. (North Coast Rivers Alliance et al. V. Marin Municipal Water District (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 614, 633.) The Project, as designed and proposed, cannot be found to be consistent with the Land Use and Urban Design Element of the City's General Plan.
By way of example:

1) Policy LU-1.2.2 requires that "[a]s part of the development review process, City
departments will review all future development to ensure that safety requirements are met, including building and fire codes, accessibility standards and crime prevention techniques. Yet, as indicated above, the City's failure to ensure that the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street indicates that no such review has been performed (or that, if it has, the requirement to ensure safety has been obviated) such that a dangerous condition not only is permitted to exist, but it is being worsened by increasing the vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the area while also attempting to authorize a large development where a single-story structure currently exists, further reducing sight lines on a dangerous curve a in the road. Similarly, the proposed waivers to reduce parking space dimensions and drive aisle widths do not "ensure that safety requirements are met, including building and fire codes, [nor] accessibility standards."
2) Policy LU-2.1.2 requires the City to "[s]upport infill development and subdivision proposals that reinforce neighborhood strengths and benefit neighborhood identity," yet the Project proposes a development which is so different in character and intensity from any other in the neighborhood, both with respect to its architectural style and the materials used on its exterior walls - none of which can be found elsewhere in this community. Thus, it cannot be said that this Project will "reinforce" the existing visual appeal of the community.
3) Policy LU-2.1.5 requires the implementation of projects in the "Mixed-Use Overlay Zone by promoting the rehabilitation of properties and new development that fits into the context of the existing neighborhoods while meeting the City's Urban Design Objectives for infill development." Again, as noted directly above, in #2, the Project is completely out of character and context with respect to the existing neighborhood such that this policy cannot be met.
4) Policy LU-4.2.3 requires that "[n]ew development shall provide adequate
parking. As the Project specifically seeks to not only reduce parking space numbers below the City's normal standards, it also seeks to reduce the number below those permitted under the State Density Bonus Law (albeit, improperly attempting to do so via a waiver, as indicated in the immediately preceding two sections of this letter). Also, as indicated in the immediately preceding section, the Project does not provide adequate parking not only with respect to the reduced number of spaces it proposes, but also improperly attempts to reduce the dimensions of the spaces and the drive aisles around them in a manner likely to impact the public's (and future residents') health and safety. Thus, the Project clearly conflicts with this policy as well.
5) Objective UD-1.1 requires the City's "[t]o protect La Mesa's existing built environment and cultural heritage." But the Project proposes to destroy the LMWC clubhouse

PWM59

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
March 8, 2021
Page 8 of 13

which has been in place for over half a century and, thus, conflicts directly and inarguably with
this policy.
6) Objective UD-3.1 requires that development be "architecturally and environmentally sensitive and ...compatible with neighboring design and scale." As indicated in the discussions regarding Policy LU-1.2.2 and Policy LU-2.1.2 directly above, the Project is unlike anything in this neighborhood, especially with respect to its design and scale, and therefore, conflicts with this objective of the General Plan.
In short, the Project cannot be said to be in harmony with the City's General Plan Land Use and Urban Design Element as proposed. As such, it must be revised significantly to come into conformance with the General Plan, and the surrounding community.

II. The Project Fails To Comply With The California Environmental Quality Act
The primary purposes of CEQA are to inform City decisionmakers, as well as the public,
about the potential impacts of a project, and to prescribe mitigation measures to avoid such
impacts. CEQA requires a broad view of what constitutes a project requiring environmental
analysis. (McQueen v. Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1143.) Even projects that
appear benign will likely fall within the ambit of CEQA. (Bloom v. McGurk (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1307, 1312.) The California State Legislature formulated CEQA to "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of the environment shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions." (Pub. Res. Code §21001(d).) To implement this goal, CEQA requires municipalities to analyze discretionary projects for potential environmental impacts utilizing a three-tier system. (No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 74.) The first tier is known as a preliminary review. The preliminary review requires public agency staff to analyze a complete application in order to discern the full scope of the project at issue. (CEQA Guidelines section 15060(b); City of Pasadena V. The State of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 810, 836.) Once the parameters of the project are established, a determination is made to resolve whether an exemption is applicable to the project. If such an exemption is found, the agency must determine that no exceptions to the exemption are triggered by the potential impacts from the full scope of the project. (CEQA Guidelines §§ 15060, 15061.) If the project is not exempt from CEQA, or an exception is applicable, the second tier of review is required wherein an initial study is prepared because it has been determined that there is a possibility that the project may have a significant effect on the environment. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063.) An initial study facilitates environmental assessment early in the design of a project. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063(c).) In the third tier, the initial study is used to demonstrate that either: a) the project "will not have a significant effect," triggering the preparation of a negative declaration, or b) the project is one "which may have a significant effect on the environment," triggering the preparation of an environmental impact report ("EIR").
(CEQA Guidelines § 15064.)

PWM60

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
March 8, 2021
Page 9 of 13

While the Guidelines provide opportunities for projects to be exempted from CEQA
review, these exemptions are limited in nature. "Only those projects having no significant effect on the environment are categorically exempt from CEQA review." (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network, supra, at p. 1102.) A significant effect is a "substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in the environment." (Pub. Res. Code §21068. [Emphasis added.]) This means that an activity has a significant effect if, among other things, it "has the potential to degrade the quality of the environment." (Pub. Res. Code § 21083.) "[A]n activity that may have a significant effect on the environment cannot be categorically exempt." (Mountain Lion Foundation V. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 124. [Emphasis added.])

The courts review categorical exemptions using strict construction in a manner affording the greatest environmental protection within the reasonable scope of the statutory language. (County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 966.) "[E]xemption categories are not to be expanded or broadened beyond the reasonable scope of their statutory language." (Dehne v. County of Santa Clara (1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 827, 842.) Thus, an exemption must be applicable in light of the full scope of a project.

A public agency has the burden of proving that substantial evidence supports its factual
finding that project falls within the asserted exemption. (Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose, 54 Cal. App. 4th 106, 114-115 (1997); Magan v. County of Kings (2002) 105 Cal.App.4th 468, 475.) "An agency's duty to provide such factual support 'is all the more important where the record shows ...that opponents of the project have raised arguments regarding possible significant environmental impacts." (Muzzy Ranch Co. v. Solano County Airport Land Use Com. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 372, 386.) A city cannot impose a burden on the public to prove a possibility of adverse environmental impacts since this would frustrate CEQA's fundamental purpose of ensuring that government officials "make decisions with environmental consequences in mind." (Davidon Homes, supra, at p. 116; California Farm Bureau Federation v. California Wildlife Conservation Bd. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 186.) "[T]he agency's exemption determination must be supported by evidence in the record demonstrating that the agency considered possible environmental impacts in reaching its decision." (Davidon Homes, supra, at p. 117; East Peninsula Ed. Council, Inc. v. Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School Dist. (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 155, 171.)
The record before the City, limited as it is because of the lack of analysis performed by CityMark, reveals that the Project's potential effects on the environment make the application of
a categorical exemption legally inappropriate. In fact, most of the environmental analysis performed, to date, has been by the church's experts and those analysis have not been challenged, nor apparently analyzed by the City.

A. The City May Not Apply The In-Fill Development Exemption In Light Of The
Project's Expected, and Known, Potentially Significant Impacts

The City proposes to avoid CEQA review of the Project by employing the In-Fill Development exemption found at CEQA Guidelines section 15332. This exemption provides that in-fill development may avoid CEQA analysis if:

(a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and
regulations.
(b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more
than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses. (c) The project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened
species.
(d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to
traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality.
(e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.

Our client has secured all Project materials the City purports to have in its possession or control via the California Public Records Act ("CPRA"). In securing this data, it has become readily obvious that very little analysis of the Project's potentially significant impacts to the
environment have been performed to date. In fact, the only data in the administrative record
analyzing the Project under CEQA has been provided by our client's environmental experts. These analyses, and the records produced pursuant to the above-mentioned CPRA request, indicate that though CityMark submitted an "Environmental Assessment/Initial Study Application" the City
has performed no analysis of its own and has no Initial Study to indicate whether further
environmental review must occur. Moreover, the expert analyses provided by our client,
concretely and definitively specifies potentially significant impacts in the following CEQA
categories:

(1) Air quality impacts arising from construction. This is especially important in that the Project proposes significant grading "400 cubic yards of excavation (cut) and 1,400 cubic yards of fill…. primarily used to raise the rear of the site to establish pad for the parking area [along with].... [a] retaining wall of up to eight and a half feet in height is planned along the south end of the parking area" - which is directly adjacent to the area
where 125 students currently attend the Warren Walker School, on the church campus.
These students are sensitive receptors, spending time outdoors to learn and play, and with open windows, especially during the COVID-19 era, to provide additional ventilation limiting disease spread. (2) Noise impact arising from construction. Again, much like the air impacts category, directly above, but likely to last significantly longer as the construction noise will exist

PWM62

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
March 8, 2021
Page 11 of 13

throughout the site's development both before (during demolition) and long past (during construction) the grading operations. The noise from all of this construction will flow unimpeded into the directly adjacent school and playground disrupting hundreds of children's' education for what is likely to be a period of one to two years. (3) Hazardous materials disposal during construction. The LMWC building was constructed prior to the elimination of asbestos-containing materials, lead-based paints, and polychlorinated biphenyls, yet no analysis has been made of these hazards (or methods to mitigate these potential hazards) upon adjacent residents, churchgoers, senior living facility residents, and/or schoolchildren. (4) Hydrology and water quality impacts from the developed Project. The church's experts have analyzed the existing site, and the proposed Project at build-out, and determined that the Project's drainage study inaccurately describes the conditions such that considerably more stormwater is expected to flow onto the church property than
reported.
(5) Transportation impacts from construction and the developed Project. These impacts include significant numbers of heavy-haul trucks going through Wilson Street (designated a local collector) interrupting regular traffic and parking along the road, as well as church and school pick-ups and drop-offs, and a failure to follow the current standard in traffic analysis under CEQA, namely a vehicle miles traveled (VMT) analysis pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15064.3. And as indicated above, the analysis indicates the dangers inherent in the intersection at Grossmont Boulevard and
Wilson Street.

But for the Project's hydrology and water quality analyses, the church's expert analyses on
the remaining impact categories described above remain the only information in the administrative
record such that the City cannot simply overlook the described potentially significant impacts.
Neither the Project applicant, nor the City itself, have made any attempt to respond to these expert
analyses such that CEQA requires that an initial study be prepared. (Hansen Brothers Enterprises,
Inc. v. Board of Supervisors (1996) 12 Cal.4th 533, 560 [standing for the proposition that undisputed evidence in the administrative record must be relied upon.].) Until such time as the Project applicant, or the City, rebut the evidence presented by the church's experts, and with respect to certain issues, the testimony, and opinions of laypersons, those remain the only materials
upon which the City may rely in determining whether the exemption to CEQA under Guidelines section 15332 may be effective.
Under CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c), "[a] categorical exemption shall not be used
for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." Such an exception to CEQA Guidelines section 15332 exists in the administrative record in light of church's undisputed expert testimony as to impact categories described above. The City may not ignore evidence of an unusual circumstance creating a reasonable possibility of a significant environmental impact. (Committee to Save the

PWM63

Ms. Kinnard

Hollywoodland Specific Plan v City of Los Angeles (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1187; McQueen
v Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1148; Lewis v Seventeenth District Agricultural
Association (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 823, 211.)
In light of these facts, the City cannot use a categorical exemption to avoid further analysis of the Project and must proceed to prepare an initial study followed by the preparation of a mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report permitting the public and the City's decisionmakers a thoughtful and reasoned opportunity to examine the totality of the Project
and its potential impacts.

III. Conclusion

The City has failed to provide the public with a substantive opportunity to participate in a public forum regarding this Project in light of the inadequate (and with respect to the DAB, non- existent) notice, along with the practical impossibility of petitioning the government with a fulsome expression of the public's interests and grievances with regard to the development. The sharply limited deadlines needlessly imposed on the public do not comport with the law.
Further, the Project does not comply with the City's General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, the
State Density Bonus Law, nor CEQA. In all, this Project must be sent back for significant further
revisions and review.

We further note that the church is now engaged a in a quiet title action with the LMWC,' before the superior court, over the church's driveway to resolve the ownership, possession, and control of this area. Should the court determine that the church is the title owner of the land, the
Project's total size will be sharply reduced resulting in a significant reduction in its base density, as well as any density bonus which may be afforded to it under the current proposal. Moreover, the Project seeks to install a tall retaining wall along this driveway, which will not be permissible upon the church securing explicit title in this land. And, the Project plans show that the church's driveway is being improperly shown as a fire truck access road during times of emergency though it does not offer access to the Project site given the steep slope separating the properties. In light of this, we strongly recommend the City hold back any decision which may result in confusing
these issues or bringing the City into the action unnecessarily.

1 We note the DRB and DAB Staff Reports both inaccurately claim that the Project site at 5220 Wilson Street is owned by CityMark. It is, in fact, owned solely by the LMWC according to the church's latest information.

Re: Appeal of March 8, 2021 Development Advisory Board Determination Regarding Project
No. 2020-16

Dear Ms. Wiegelman:
This correspondence shall serve as a request to appeal the March 8, 2021 City of La Mesa ("City") Development Advisory Board ("DAB") approval of the CityMark Communities LLC ("Applicant") development project, and exemption from the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California, also known as Project No. 2020-16 (the "Project').
Appeal of DAB Determination
Pursuant to La Mesa Municipal Code sections 2.08.051 and 24.02.035, this firm, acting on behalf of its client, St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California ("St. Luke's") located at 5150 Wilson Street, hereby timely appeals the DAB's March 8. 2021 approval of the Project and its exemption from review under CEQA, and attaches a check in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) (a copy of which is presented with the electronic version of the correspondence as Exhibit "A"). As the neighboring property owner representing the interests of its congregation as well as the community at large, St. Luke's files this appeal in light of specific violations of CEQA, the La Mesa Municipal Code, including but not limited to the Project's zoning requirements and concomitant development standards, the California State Density Bonus Law (Government Code § 65915 et seq.), and the City's General Plan as iterated in the letter delivered to the DAB on March 8, 2021 and attached hereto as Exhibit "B."
In addition, certain representations made at the subject DAB hearing indicate that the Project is further violative of the law. We lay several of these issues out below:
1) In expectation of the Project's residents accessing the Grossmont Shopping Center directly across Grossmont Boulevard, the City's staff report to the DAB, at page 2, acknowledges that the "intersection [of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street] is not signalized and is lacking curb

PWM72

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Wiegelman, La Mesa City Clerk March 16, 2021
Page 2 of 6

ramps and crosswalks." The Applicant's traffic engineer, during the public comment portion of the DAB hearing, indicated that the Project would install a crosswalk across Grossmont Boulevard.
Yet, an examination of the Project plans, as reflected in the staff report, indicates no such street
improvements are offered, nor is the City's approval conditioned on the installation of a safe,
signalized crosswalk at this intersection - though it is well understood to be a dangerous location in light of the curvature of the street and speed of the automobiles moving through the area. Instead, the staff report, at page 5, provides "[a]s a condition of approval, the applicant will pay a fair-share contribution towards crosswalk improvements to the intersection." Such a mitigation measure is
improper in the following respects (beyond those points made in our March 8, 2021 comment letter
to the DAB):
a. First, the imposition of this condition of approval shows the DAB, and city staff, recognize the intersection requires a crosswalk in light of the Project's addition of 49 households of new residents, and the additional pedestrian traffic expected from
the Project's three retail spaces, directly accessing the Grossmont Shopping Center
for shopping or parking purposes (the latter especially, in light of the Project's deficient parking space supply). This dangerous condition (i.e., no safe crosswalk, stop signs, or signals) will be heightened by the addition of dozens, if not hundreds,
of additional individuals trying to cross Grossmont Boulevard on a daily basis - a
clear and unmistakable impact requiring review and mitigation under CEQA. Yet,
the DAB approved an exemption from CEQA review declaring that there is no reasonable possibility that a significant impact exists pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c). This determination does not comport with the facts, nor the City's determination that a condition on the Project is required to contribute towards the safety of this intersection. On this basis alone, the DAB's approval of a categorical exemption is without merit. b. Second, the DAB's approval of a fair-share contribution, on its face, indicates that the City expects other neighboring future developments to contribute to the correction of the unsafe conditions at the Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street
intersection due to the foreseeable addition of more pedestrians and vehicles due to residential and commercial development in the area. This, too, indicates that the cumulative impact exception found at CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(b) (*All [categorical] exemptions. are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.") applies, such that the DAB could not lawfully approve a categorical CEQA exemption to this Project. c. Third, the imposition of a mitigation measure, such as a condition requiring a street improvement, or payment of a fair-share contribution toward such an improvement, inherently indicates that the Project is expected to result in a significant impact. In such an instance, no categorical CEQA exemption may be granted. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102.) Notwithstanding this, DAB chairman, and Community Development

Director, Kerry Kusiak's attempt to waive this legal impropriety by arguing that the $5,000 contribution to street improvements is a feature of the a Project rather than a
condition imposed by the City runs counter to the plain language of the approval the fair-share contribution is "a condition of approval" (staff report, page 5), and "[t]he applicant shall provide a fee in-lieu of $5,000 [sic] for construction of an
ADA compliant curb ramp at the southeast corner of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street" (DAB Resolution No. DAB-2021-xx, at page 4, Engineering Condition of Approval #21).

Moreover, the argument that this $5,000 contribution is a feature of the Project
offered by the Applicant, rather than a mitigation measure imposed by the City, is patently absurd. The Applicant repeatedly indicates, in its own words, when (improperly) seeking waivers under the State Density Bonus Law, that the Project would be financially infeasible due to "cost impacts" if it were to meet the City's development standards (see staff report, Attachment E, pages 2-5) -so, the Council
would have to believe that the Applicant is claiming financial difficulty and
simultaneously giving away cash to the City even though it was under no obligation to do so (and that there no Project impact to this intersection dictate the imposition
of a mitigation measure). Such efforts to avoid CEQA must be avoided as an affront to the community this Council and its staff serve.
As further described in our March 8, 2021 (Exhibit "B"), this mitigation measure also runs afoul of the basic tenet of CEQA jurisprudence that payment into a fair-share fee is only permissible if the fees are "part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency commits itself to implementing." (Anderson First Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173, 1187.) There appears to be no such plan, commitment, nor funds to implement, the construction of a crosswalk across Grossmont Boulevard at Wilson Street, nor any indication as to how the $5,000 condition of approval was determined to result in "fair-share" of the overall
expense in light of the Project's impacts - this is, of course, because there has been no lawful review of the Project's impacts at this intersection in direct violation of CEQA.
The City's Design Review Board, also on March 8, 2021, conditioned the Project's approval on the Applicant's a provision of a traffic analysis to prove that the intersection of
Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street was inherently dangerous requiring deviation from the
City's standard public realm improvements in the Mixed Use ("MU") zone. This condition indicates that the Applicant specifically seeks a waiver of required development standards due to a hazardous condition to health and safety at this intersection (i.e., by adding numerous new pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles). Whether the waiver is granted, or not, the fact remains that the City acknowledges the Project will generate impacts at this intersection requiring review and mitigation measures such that a categorical CEQA exemption may not be approved in light of CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c).

PWM74

Ms. Wiegelman, La Mesa City Clerk

Making matters worse, Mr. Kusiak, also a Design Review Board member, declared that the traffic report required of the Project would not be prepared until the Applicant provided "construction drawings" for the development such construction drawings are submitted when seeking building permits, well after the Project's discretionary entitlements have been considered and issued by the City. This, too, runs afoul of CEQA in that mitigation measures, and analyses, studies, and reports required to develop such measures in light of expected environmental impacts may not be deferred. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4(a)(1)(B).)
2) Throughout the DAB hearing, Mr. Kusiak incorrectly declared that the Project was a "by- right" development. A "by-right" development means the Project cannot be reviewed in a discretionary manner but must instead by approved ministerially. This is incorrect and runs afoul of CEQA in that it provides an inaccurate description of the Project likely to mislead the public, and other decisionmakers, as to their rights and the scope of analysis owed the Project under the
law.

The California Supreme Court recently opined on this very issue clarifying the difference
between discretionary and ministerial projects:
A permit issuance decision can be discretionary or ministerial depending on the circumstances. Those terms are defined in the CEQA Guidelines. A project is discretionary when an agency is required to exercise judgment or deliberation in deciding whether to approve an activity. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15357.) It is distinguished from a ministerial project, for which the agency merely determines whether applicable statutes, ordinances, regulations, or other fixed standards have been satisfied. (Ibid.) Ministerial projects are those for which "the law requires [an] agency to act ... in a set way without allowing the agency to use its own judgment...." (CEQA Guidelines, cop 15002, subd. (i)(1).) They involve "little or no personal judgment by the public official as to the wisdom or manner of carrying out the project. The public official merely applies the law to the facts as presented but uses no special discretion or judgment in reaching a decision."(CEQA Guidelines,
§ 15369.) [Protecting Our Water & Environmental Resources v. County of Stanislaus (2020) 10 Cal.5th 479, 489.1
On its face, the Project requires the approval of a Site Development Plan in light of its MU zoning. (DAB staff report, page 2 ["Entitlement review for new development in the MU zone involves site development plan review by the Development Advisory Board and design review by the Design Review Board, subject to City Council ratification."] The La Mesa Municipal Code, at section 24.02.034, further indicates that the review of a Site Development Plan is a discretionary process subject to approval, approval with conditions or denial, upon determining the project findings to be satisfactory and the City's design objectives are met, to ensure "that no detriment to

PWM75

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Wiegelman, La Mesa City Clerk
March 16, 2021
Page 5 of 6

the public health, safety of welfare will result." Such a review specifically calls out the City's responsibility to use its judgment in deliberating whether to approve the Project's Site
Development Plan.
Moreover, Mr. Kusiak's declaration that the Project is "by-right" does not comport with CEQA. CEQA specifically does not apply to ministerial projects. (Public Resources Code so. 21080(b).) The very fact that the DAB sought to approve an exemption from CEQA pursuant to Guideline section 15332 indicates that the Project is discretionary in that a CEQA exemption is
not applicable to ministerial projects.
CEQA is intended to provide the public, and decisionmakers, with accurate information about the nature and full scope of a development. (County of Inyo V. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal. App. 3d 185, 192.) Providing inaccurate information, misleading the public, and other decisionmakers, as to their rights to review and analyze the Project is a disservice to the community and discourages thoughtful discussion necessary to shape a discretionary development review. (Id. [an "accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an informative and legally sufficient" review under CEQA.J.) The inaccurate description of the Project must be corrected to
comply with CEQA.
Similarly, Mr. Kusiak stated that the DAB had no authority to deny the Project's requested waiver under the State Density Bonus Law due to health and safety concerns (raised, largely, with respect to the dangerous traffic-related conditions at the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street). This, too, is an incorrect statement of the law and the scope of the City's authority
to review the Project under CEQA. As indicated in our March 8, 2021 letter to the DAB,
Government Code section 65915(e)(1) specifically provides that waivers of development standards under the State Density Bonus Law should not be granted when they would result in "specific, adverse impact... upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact." Though the DAB (and the DRB), as well as the City staff report, acknowledge that the Project's waivers result in specific, adverse impacts upon health, safety, and the physical environment without offer of satisfactory mitigation, due to the claimed exemption from CEQA, with respect to public realm improvements (resulting in hazardous traffic conditions), parking space size and drive aisle standards (resulting in hazardous traffic and parking conditions), open space standards, landscaping standards, and other deviations from development standards, these waivers were approved due to an inaccurate statement of the law claiming that the DAB could not deny the waivers under circumstances where specific, adverse impacts to health and safety are expressly acknowledged to exist. In light of this, the Project's waivers must be reconsidered and its impacts on the environment reviewed to determine what mitigation measures may be imposed.
Further, in light of the rampant inaccuracies, misstatements of law, and impropriety of appointing City staff (i.e., the Community Development Director, City Engineer, Building Division Director, and Fire Marshal) to review staff recommendations, and afford discretionary

PWM76

approval of projects, we strongly recommend the City reconsider its current practices. It does not appear that the composition of the DAB, nor the Design Review Board, afford any semblance of an impartial determination on matters of great importance to the public. Rather, these bodies appear to act as "rubber-stamps" on staff decisions. At the very least, the Council should consider having a municipal attorney staff each such meeting to protect the City's interests, and those of
the community.

Re: Project No. 2020-16 (CityMark Communities LLC) - 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, CA

Dear Ms. Kinnard:

This law firm represents the St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California located at
5150 Wilson Street, directly adjacent to the La Mesa Woman's Club ("LMWC*), the site of a 49
residential unit and three commercial unit mixed-use project ("Project") proposed by CityMark Communities LLC ("CityMark") known as Project No. 2020-16. This correspondence is offered to inform the City of La Mesa ("City") of our client's grave concerns regarding the proposed Project, the limited conditions recommended to ensure the health and safety of the public, and the apparent lack of analysis of the Project's expected impacts.
We also wish to bring to the City's attention that on December 17, 2020 this firm requested to be placed on the notice list for all public hearings relating to the Project, and specifically those relating to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Notwithstanding this, we were only sent notice of the March 8, 2021, 12:30 p.m. Design Review Board ("DRB") meeting after
regular work hours, at 8:10 p.m., on Thursday, March 4, 2021 (see Attachment "1"), indicating that the City requires audio/visual presentations by the public to be submitted by "12:00 noon, one business day prior to the start of the meeting." It would be practically impossible to prepare and
transmit any presentation, let alone a thoughtful one, within three regular working hours of receipt of said notice (i.e., after 9 a.m. on March 5, 2021) to comply with the City's stated deadline. What is more, no notice was sent to this office of the March 8, 2021, 10 a.m. Development Advisory Board ("DAB") meeting though we understand that an exemption to CEQA analysis is to be voted on in this hearing. In fact, it is solely due to our client's diligence in searching the City's website, at approximately 11:15 am on March 5, 2021, that we learned of the DAB meeting at all again,
making it impossible to provide the City with an audio/visual presentation by the 12:00 noon
deadline set for that same day.
We understand that COVID-19 has altered the conditions by which we all live and work, and that the City is permitted to avoid direct communications from the public during such hearings

in light of California Executive Order N-29-20. Yet, the failure to afford the public a practical a opportunity to review, analyze, and respond to the Project's 137-page DRB staff report and the 150-page DAB staff report does not comport with the public's statutory and constitutional rights to petition its government under the Ralph M. Brown Act. (Government Code 54950 et seq.; Cal. Const., Art. I § 3, subd. (a) and (b)(1), (7).) These actions run afoul of the law as they present limitations on public participation which are simply "too arbitrary and capricious, too restrictive and unreasonable." (Nevens v. Chino (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 775, 778; see also Robins V. Pruneyard Shopping Center (1979) 23 Cal.3d 899, 907 [The right of the people to petition the government for redress of grievances is "vital to a basic process in the state's constitutional
scheme."].)
Furthermore, should CityMark, or its consultants, be permitted to present audio/visual
materials to, or communicate directly with, the DAB or DRB boards during these hearings on March 8, 2021 it will only heighten the inequities inherent in providing late, or no, notice to the public, with regard to the respective rights of the parties to petition their government. This would be an unfortunate, and likely unlawful, action in unequal treatment under both state and federal statutes and constitutions. A more reasoned action would be to postpone each of the DAB and DRB hearings by a week, or more, to permit each party, and the public more generally, an opportunity to present their positions thoughtfully.
Notwithstanding this, we offer a limited summary of our client's position with respect to the proposed Project in the hopes that it will be presented to the DAB and DRB board members for review prior to any discussion of, or determination on, this matter. In light of the severely constrained time available to us before the DAB and DRB meetings, we will not reiterate each of the points made in prior communications and correspondence delivered to the City in opposition to the Project but join in those comments by this reference. Rather, we will focus briefly on the inadequate analysis of the Project in light of the City's General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, the Project's inapt use of California State Density Bonus Law (Gov. Code § 65915 et seq.) waivers, and the impropriety of the claimed CEQA exemption under Guidelines section 15332.

I. The Project Runs Afoul Of The General Plan's Urban Design Element And The
Zoning Ordinance
As the staff reports to each of the DAB and DRB indicate, the Project site is designated as "Mixed Use Urban," corresponding to the Mixed Use (MU) Overlay, in the Residential Business base zone and is intended to support "pedestrian friendly housing." (DAB Staff Report, p. 2; DRB Staff Report, p.2.) Notwithstanding this, the Project seeks to avoid the very features it is obligated to provide to enable pedestrian-friendly housing.

The Project sits under 100 feet away, directly across Grossmont Boulevard, from the Grossmont Shopping Center. The closest supermarket to the Project is the Walmart Neighborhood Market therein, lying approximately 350 feet away, yet because there is no crosswalk, stop sign, and/or traffic signal at the intersection of Wilson Street and Grossmont Boulevard, a resident of the Project would be required to walk about three-quarters of a mile to safely cross the street, pick up groceries, and return with them - it is doubtful many residents will be able to lug an average family's weekly groceries this distance, on foot. (DAB Staff Report, p. 2 [In fact, the City
recognizes this failing at the beginning of its report, "The intersection is not signalized and is lacking curb ramps and crosswalks."]; see also DRB Staff Report at p. 2 for the same
acknowledgment of a dangerous condition].) Notwithstanding this, it appears the Project is being permitted to avoid the development of a crosswalk which is absolutely necessary for its residents or, at least, providing an analysis showing the Project will generate significantly more average
daily vehicular trips and vehicle miles traveled than contemplated.
The City failed to require a traffic analysis for the Project, though it initially sought to require an ADA-compliant ramp be constructed at this intersection before apparently dropping this condition altogether. Our client's environmental consultant has also indicated this intersection is particularly dangerous because of limited sightlines arising from a substantial curve in Grossmont Boulevard in this area. The observation that this particular intersection is dangerous has been voiced numerous times in correspondence submitted to the City by multiple parties. Yet the staff
reports show that no ramp, crosswalk, or analysis was required of the Project - instead, the Project is conditioned to provide a $5,000 "fair-share" payment toward a ramp to be built by an unknown party at an unknown time in the future. This does not comport with the law.
There appears to be no plan on file to develop a safe intersection at Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street, and the $5,000 payment does not appear to go towards any previously approved fund for that purpose. Nor is there any indication of how this figure was calculated. In Anderson First Coalition V. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173, the appellate court held that a paying a "fair-share fee" is permissible as effective mitigation only if the fees are "part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency commits itself to implementing." That
is not the case in this instance. In light of this, the City must require the installation of an appropriately signalized intersection, or some other traffic calming feature here, or require the Project to present an analysis indicating why it should not do so. The only evidence in the
administrative record, to date, on this topic shows that the City initially desired a crosswalk to be
installed but backed off without explanation (or analysis available to the public, or the City's
decisionmakers).
"Tn MU areas, new development is required to include pedestrian realm improvements along collector streets to encourage pedestrian activity. The Circulation Element classifies
Grossmont Boulevard as a major collector street subject to pedestrian realm requirements.' (DAB Staff Report, p. 2; DRB Staff Report, p. 2. [Emphasis added.]; see also La Mesa Municipal Code

co 24.18.040(B).) The condition to pay a fee in lieu of an actual mitigation measure regarding a known project impact runs afoul of CEQA and should not be permitted. Rather the Project must be required to perform an analysis to determine the scope of the impact and to then mitigation measure to reduce that impact to a less than significant level. propose a

Moreover, this mitigation measure is improper on two other bases. First, it improperly
attempts to defer mitigation until a later (and, in this case, unknown future) time. This is
specifically forbidden under CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4 (a)(1)(B).) And second, a mitigation IS measure is only available if a project under CEQA is expected to generate a potentially significant impact on the environment, but the staff report indicates that the Project is exempt from CEQA because there are no such expected impacts. (DAB Staff Report, p. 7-8; see also DAB Staff Report, Attachment A, "Resolution No. DAB-2021-xx at Par. 1.) So, either the Project is not exempt from CEQA and cannot be conditioned to mitigate a potentially significant impact, or it must be
analyzed properly under CEQA (i.e., by preparation of an Initial Study, followed by specific impact category studies, and the development of a mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report). The status quo does not comport with the law. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network V. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102 [a public agency may not adopt mitigation measures for a project for the purpose of qualifying it for a categorical CEQA exemption; see also Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1200.)
A. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Limited To Overcoming Physical, Not Financial,
Constraints Such That Avoiding Improvements To The Pedestrian Realm Are Not
Permitted For This Project

As indicated above, the Project is designated Mixed Use Urban requiring improvements to the surrounding pedestrian realm. LMMC 24.18.020(E) defines the term "pedestrian realm" as
follows:

"Pedestrian realm" means a twelve-foot wide area located between the face of the
curb of a Circulation Element designated street and the face of the building. The pedestrian realm includes the parkway, sidewalk, and landscaped areas. The pedestrian realm may include both public and private property where the public
right-of-way is not twelve feet wide. Pedestrian amenities, street trees, street
furniture, bus stop facilities, and other landscaping, as specified in this chapter, shall be included in the public realm.
Notwithstanding this acknowledged requirement, "[w]aivers are being requested to allow reductions in….. pedestrian realm requirements." (DAB Staff Report, p. 3; DRB Staff Report, p. 3.) For instance, the Project seeks a "waiver" under the State Density Bonus Law so that it may encroach four feet into the pedestrian realm along Grossmont Boulevard by installing balconies hanging over this right of way. This miscomprehends what a waiver is under the law.

PWM84

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard

Page 5 of 13

Pursuant to Government Code §65915(e)(1), waivers (as opposed to incentives) are afforded to a density bonus project only when "development standard will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development," not because the developer desires it, or because it will enhance the financial prospects of a project. Put another way, a waiver permits deviation from, or altogether evasion of, regulations which affect a project due to its site-specific physical features. This subject site has no such physical constraints. Rather, the balconies could
be built outside of the pedestrian realm (i.e., within the building envelope) by moving the exterior walls along Grossmont Boulevard back four feet, or removed altogether. The applicant itself makes clear that it is not a physical constraint that drives this waiver request when it states its justification as follows:
This waiver is requested due to excessive space and cost impacts to incorporate the Open Space requirement and private balconies. The loss of development potential to incorporate this would make the project infeasible to provide the affordable units.
As mentioned above, the site itself does not have any physical obstruction which precludes
construction of these balconies, rather CityMark simply desires to have them overhang the pedestrian realm because it would increase their financial incentive to develop the Project. The
State Density Bonus Law permits this sort of deviation from regulation for financial gain through the use of incentives, of which the Project has two (waivers, on the other hand, are unlimited for such developments). Yet, the Project avoids using any of its incentives and instead improperly requests at least five waivers to avoid its open space requirements, building height limit, parking space sizing, landscaping required within the pedestrian realm, and overall parking requirements. In each such instance, CityMark indicates that the justification for the waiver is not a physical constraint unique to the site but rather the request is made to seek a financial boon for the
developer.
The reason the Project seeks to use waivers rather than incentives is clear on its face - the State Density Bonus Law does not authorize a sufficient number of incentives (i.e., the Project requires five, but only has two available to it) to meet CityMark's desired financial goals, whereas it may request an unlimited number of waivers. Because it does not have sufficient incentives to develop the Project in this manner, it attempts to avoid their use altogether and instead make faulty
justifications for waivers which are impermissible under the law.
Because CityMark cannot show a physical constraint exists which limits the development of the Project under the City's laws and policies, it must use its incentives (and justify the use of those incentives by showing the financial benefit gained thereby) and/or redesign the Project to be in conformity with the law.

B. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Not Permitted To Overcome Regulations That Pertain To Health And Safety

As mentioned above, the Project's requests for waivers are inapposite to the law because they pertain to financial rather than physical constraints. In addition, the Project improperly seeks to waive the City's standard parking space and driving aisle dimensions even
though this would result in direct health and safety impacts. Waivers are impermissible on this
basis as well.

The dimensions of parking spaces and adjacent driving aisles are specified to ensure the safety of vehicles, their drivers and passengers, and pedestrians. (LMMC § 22.112.010(B).) This makes common sense - if spaces and driving aisles are too small, or otherwise constrained, they are likelier to lead to physical harm from other vehicles when vacating or entering : space and are
the reason why State building codes requires minimum parking dimensions to ensure health and safety. (DAB Staff Report, p. 3 & Attachment D, pp. 3-4; DRB Staff Report, p. 3 & Attachment
E, pp. 3-4.)
Government Code section 65915(e)(1) of the State Density Bonus Law provides:
Nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted to require a local government to waive or reduce development standards if the waiver or reduction would have a
specific, adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section
65589.5, upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact.
[Emphasis added.]
Thus, a waiver cannot be used to avoid the specific, adverse impact arising from
the reduction of a basic safety feature inherent in parking stall/space sizes and driving aisle
dimensions as contemplated by the Project due to the health and safety issues it raises. No justification exists which would be sufficient to overcome this requested reduction in health and safety standards, nor would an incentive permit such a thing.

C. The Project, As Designed, Is Contrary To The Chief Land Use Policies Declared Under The Land Use And Urban Design Element Of The General Plan
California law requires each city and county to adopt a general plan, a comprehensive long- term plan for the development of that city or county, famously referred to by the state Supreme
Court as the "constitution for future development." (Lesher Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut
Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 540.) A general plan must contain seven mandatory "elements," including a "land use element" to designate the level of intensity and general distribution of land uses. (Gov. Code § 65302.) "[T]he propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development depends upon [a finding of] consistency with the applicable general plan and its

PWM86

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard

elements." (Resource Defense Fund v. County of Santa Cruz (1982) 133 Cal.App.3rd 800, 806.) CEQA imposes an obligation on La Mesa to assess the Project's consistency with the City's General Plan. (North Coast Rivers Alliance et al. v. Marin Municipal Water District (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 614, 633.) The Project, as designed and proposed, cannot be found to be consistent with the Land Use and Urban Design Element of the City's General Plan.
By way of example:

1) Policy LU-1.2.2 requires that "[a]s part of the development review process, City departments will review all future development to ensure that safety requirements are met, including building and fire codes, accessibility standards and crime prevention techniques. Yet, as indicated above, the City's failure to ensure that the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street indicates that no such review has been performed (or that, if it has, the requirement
to ensure safety has been obviated) such that dangerous condition not only is permitted to exist, but it is being worsened by increasing the vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the area while also attempting to authorize a large development where a single-story structure currently exists, further reducing sight lines on a dangerous curve in the road. Similarly, the proposed waivers to reduce parking space dimensions and drive aisle widths do not "ensure that safety requirements are met, including building and fire codes, [nor] accessibility standards."
2) Policy LU-2.1.2 requires the City to "[s]upport infill development and subdivision proposals that reinforce neighborhood strengths and benefit neighborhood identity,' yet the Project proposes a development which is sO different in character and intensity from any other in the neighborhood, both with respect to its architectural style and the materials used on its exterior walls - none of which can be found elsewhere in this community. Thus, it cannot be said that this Project will "reinforce" the existing visual appeal of the community.
3) Policy LU-2.1.5 requires the implementation of projects in the "Mixed-Use Overlay Zone by promoting the rehabilitation of properties and new development that fits into the context of the existing neighborhoods while meeting the City's Urban Design Objectives for infill development." Again, as noted directly above, in #2, the Project is completely out of character and context with respect to the existing neighborhood such that this policy cannot be met.
4) Policy LU-4.2.3 requires that "[n]ew development shall provide adequate
parking.' As the Project specifically seeks to not only reduce parking space numbers below the City's normal standards, it also seeks to reduce the number below those permitted under the State Density Bonus Law (albeit, improperly attempting to do so via a waiver, as indicated in the immediately preceding two sections of this letter). Also, as indicated in the immediately preceding section, the Project does not provide adequate parking not only with respect to the reduced number of spaces it proposes, but also improperly attempts to reduce the dimensions of the spaces and the drive aisles around them in a manner likely to impact the public's (and future residents') health and safety. Thus, the Project clearly conflicts with this policy as well.
5) Objective UD-1.1 requires the City's "[t]o protect La Mesa's existing built environment and cultural heritage." But the Project proposes to destroy the LMWC clubhouse

PWM87

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV

which has been in place for over half a century and, thus, conflicts directly and inarguably with
this policy.
6) Objective UD-3.1 requires that development be "architecturally and
environmentally sensitive and ..compatible with neighboring design and scale." As indicated in the discussions regarding Policy LU-1.2.2 and Policy LU-2.1.2 directly above, the Project is unlike anything in this neighborhood, especially with respect to its design and scale, and therefore, conflicts with this objective of the General Plan.
In short, the Project cannot be said to be in harmony with the City's General Plan Land Use and Urban Design Element as proposed. As such, it must be revised significantly to come
into conformance with the General Plan, and the surrounding community.

II. The Project Fails To Comply With The California Environmental Quality Act
The primary purposes of CEQA are to inform City decisionmakers, as well as the public, about the potential impacts of project, and to prescribe mitigation measures to avoid such impacts. CEQA requires a broad view of what constitutes a project requiring environmental analysis. (McQueen v. Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1143.) Even projects that appear benign will likely fall within the ambit of CEQA. (Bloom v. McGurk (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1307, 1312.) The California State Legislature formulated CEQA to "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of the environment shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions.' (Pub. Res. Code §21001(d).) To implement this goal, CEQA requires municipalities to analyze discretionary projects for potential environmental impacts utilizing a three-tier system. (No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 74.) The first tier is known as a preliminary review. The preliminary review requires public agency staff to analyze a complete application in order to discern the full scope of the project at issue. (CEQA Guidelines section 15060(b); City of Pasadena v. The State of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 810, 836.) Once the parameters of the
project are established, a determination is made to resolve whether an exemption is applicable to the project. If such an exemption is found, the agency must determine that no exceptions to the exemption are triggered by the potential impacts from the full scope of the project. (CEQA Guidelines §§ 15060, 15061.) If the project is not exempt from CEQA, or an exception is applicable, the second tier of review is required wherein an initial study is prepared because it has been determined that there is a possibility that the project may have a significant effect on the environment. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063.) An initial study facilitates environmental assessment early in the design of a project. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063(c).) In the third tier, the initial study is used to demonstrate that either: a) the project "will not have a significant effect," triggering the preparation of a negative declaration, or b) the project is one "which may have a significant effect on the environment," triggering the preparation of an environmental impact report ("EIR").
(CEQA Guidelines § 15064.)

PWM88

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard

While the Guidelines provide opportunities for projects to be exempted from CEQA review, these exemptions are limited in nature. "Only those projects having no significant effect on the environment are categorically exempt from CEQA review." (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network, supra, at p. 1102.) A significant effect is a "substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in the environment." (Pub. Res. Code §21068. [Emphasis added.]) This means that an activity has a significant effect if, among other things, it "has the potential to degrade the quality of the environment." (Pub. Res. Code 21083.) "[A]n activity that may have a significant effect on the environment cannot be categorically exempt." (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 124. [Emphasis added.])
The courts review categorical exemptions using strict construction in a manner affording the greatest environmental protection within the reasonable scope of the statutory language. (County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 966.) "[E]xemption categories are not to be expanded or broadened beyond the reasonable scope of their statutory language." (Dehne v. County of Santa Clara (1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 827, 842.) Thus, an exemption must be applicable in light of the full scope of a project.
A public agency has the burden of proving that substantial evidence supports its factual finding that a project falls within the asserted exemption. (Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose, 54 Cal. App. 4th 106, 114-115 (1997); Magan V. County of Kings (2002) 105 Cal.App.4th 468, 475.) "An agency's duty to provide such factual support 'is all the more important where the record shows ...that opponents of the project have raised arguments regarding possible significant environmental impacts.™ (Muzzy Ranch Co. v. Solano County Airport Land Use Com. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 372, 386.) A city cannot impose a burden on the public to prove a possibility of adverse environmental impacts since this would frustrate CEQA's fundamental purpose of ensuring that government officials "make decisions with environmental consequences in mind." (Davidon Homes, supra, at p. 116; California Farm Bureau Federation v. California Wildlife Conservation Bd. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 186.) "[T]he agency's exemption determination must be supported by evidence in the record demonstrating that the agency considered possible environmental impacts in reaching its decision." (Davidon Homes, supra, at p. 117; East Peninsula Ed. Council, Inc. v. Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School Dist. (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 155, 171.)
The record before the City, limited as it is because of the lack of analysis performed by CityMark, reveals that the Project's potential effects on the environment make the application of a categorical exemption legally inappropriate. In fact, most of the environmental analysis performed, to date, has been by the church's experts and those analysis have not been challenged, nor apparently analyzed by the City.

A. The City May Not Apply The In-Fill Development Exemption In Light Of The Project's Expected, and Known, Potentially Significant Impacts

The City proposes to avoid CEQA review of the Project by employing the In-Fill
Development exemption found at CEQA Guidelines section 15332. This exemption provides that in-fill development may avoid CEQA analysis if:
(a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and
regulations. (b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses. (c) The project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened
species. (d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality. (e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.
Our client has secured all Project materials the City purports to have in its possession or
control via the California Public Records Act ("CPRA"). In securing this data, it has become
readily obvious that very little analysis of the Project's potentially significant impacts to the
environment have been performed to date. In fact, the only data in the administrative record analyzing the Project under CEQA has been provided by our client's environmental experts. These analyses, and the records produced pursuant to the above-mentioned CPRA request, indicate that though CityMark submitted an "Environmental Assessment/Initial Study Application" the City has performed no analysis of its own and has no Initial Study to indicate whether further environmental review must occur. Moreover, the expert analyses provided by our client, concretely and definitively specifies potentially significant impacts in the following CEQA
categories:
(1) Air quality impacts arising from construction. This is especially important in that the Project proposes significant grading "400 cubic yards of excavation (cut) and 1,400 cubic yards of fill.. primarily used to raise the rear of the site to establish a pad for the
parking area [along with].... [a] retaining wall of up to eight and a half feet in height is planned along the south end of the parking area" - which is directly adjacent to the area is where 125 students currently attend the Warren Walker School, on the church campus.
These students are sensitive receptors, spending time outdoors to learn and play, and with open windows, especially during the COVID-19 era, to provide additional ventilation limiting disease spread. (2) Noise impact arising from construction. Again, much like the air impacts category, directly above, but likely to last significantly longer as the construction noise will exist

PWM90

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
March 8, 2021
Page 11 of 13

throughout the site's development both before (during demolition) and long past (during construction) the grading operations. The noise from all of this construction will flow unimpeded into the directly adjacent school and playground disrupting
hundreds of children's' education for what is likely to be a period of one to two years.
(3) Hazardous materials disposal during construction. The LMWC building was constructed prior to the elimination of asbestos-containing materials, lead-based paints, and polychlorinated biphenyls, yet no analysis has been made of these hazards (or methods to mitigate these potential hazards) upon adjacent residents, churchgoers, senior living facility residents, and/or schoolchildren. (4) Hydrology and water quality impacts from the developed Project. The church's experts have analyzed the existing site, and the proposed Project at build-out, and determined that the Project's drainage study inaccurately describes the conditions such that considerably more stormwater is expected to flow onto the church property than
reported. (5) Transportation impacts from construction and the developed Project. These impacts include significant numbers of heavy-haul trucks going through Wilson Street (designated a local collector) interrupting regular traffic and parking along the road, as well as church and school pick-ups and drop-offs, and a failure to follow the current
standard in traffic analysis under CEQA, namely a vehicle miles traveled (VMT)
analysis pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15064.3. And as indicated above, the analysis indicates the dangers inherent in the intersection at Grossmont Boulevard and
Wilson Street.

But for the Project's hydrology and water quality analyses, the church's expert analyses on the remaining impact categories described above remain the only information in the administrative record such that the City cannot simply overlook the described potentially significant impacts. Neither the Project applicant, nor the City itself, have made any attempt to respond to these expert analyses such that CEQA requires that an initial study be prepared. (Hansen Brothers Enterprises, Inc. v. Board of Supervisors (1996) 12 Cal.4th 533, 560 [standing for the proposition that undisputed evidence in the administrative record must be relied upon.].) Until such time as the Project applicant, or the City, rebut the evidence presented by the church's experts, and with respect to certain issues, the testimony, and opinions of laypersons, those remain the only materials upon which the City may rely in determining whether the exemption to CEQA under Guidelines section 15332 may be effective.
Under CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c), "[a] categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." Such an exception to CEQA Guidelines section 15332 exists in the administrative record in light of church's undisputed expert testimony as to impact categories described above. The City may not ignore evidence of an unusual circumstance creating a reasonable possibility of a significant environmental impact. (Committee to Save the

PWM91

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
March 8, 2021
Page 12 of 13

Hollywoodland Specific Plan v City of Los Angeles (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1187; McQueen
v Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1148; Lewis v Seventeenth District Agricultural
Association (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 823, 211.)
In light of these facts, the City cannot use a categorical exemption to avoid further analysis of the Project and must proceed to prepare an initial study followed by the preparation of a
mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report permitting the public and the
City's decisionmakers a thoughtful and reasoned opportunity to examine the totality of the Project
and its potential impacts.

III. Conclusion

The City has failed to provide the public with substantive opportunity to participate in a public forum regarding this Project in light of the inadequate (and with respect to the DAB, non- existent) notice, along with the practical impossibility of petitioning the government with a
fulsome expression of the public's interests and grievances with regard to the development. The sharply limited deadlines needlessly imposed on the public do not comport with the law.
Further, the Project does not comply with the City's General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, the State Density Bonus Law, nor CEQA. In all, this Project must be sent back for significant further
revisions and review.

We further note that the church is now engaged in a quiet title action with the LMWC,' before the superior court, over the church's driveway to resolve the ownership, possession, and control of this area. Should the court determine that the church is the title owner of the land, the
Project's total size will be sharply a reduced resulting in a significant reduction in its base density,
as well as any density bonus which may be afforded to it under the current proposal. Moreover, the Project seeks to install a tall retaining wall along this driveway, which will not be permissible upon the church securing explicit title in this land. And, the Project plans show that the church's
driveway is being improperly shown as a fire truck access road during times of emergency though it does not offer access to the Project site given the steep slope separating the properties. In light of this, we strongly recommend the City hold back any decision which may result in confusing these issues or bringing the City into the action unnecessarily.

We note the DRB and DAB Staff Reports both inaccurately claim that the Project site at 5220 Wilson Street is owned by CityMark. It is, in fact, owned solely by the LMWC according to the church's latest information.

As you know, this firm filed a timely appeal of the now-defunct Development Advisory Board's ("DAB") March 8, 2021 approval of Project No. 2020-16 and grant of California environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") exemption (collectively, the "Project") on behalf of St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California ("Church"). That appeal is the subject of the July 21, 2021 hearing before the City of La Mesa ("City") Planning Commission ("Commission"). This correspondence shall serve to further explain the procedural and substantive shortcomings inherent in the DAB's actions and the Project itself, and why the Commission must, by law, approve our client's appeal.

The Approval Of The Project Is Void On Its Face and Must Be Rescinded Due To The
Development Advisory Board's Procedural Deficiencies Resulting In Its Dissolution

The Project seeks Site Development Permit ("SDP") and an exemption from CEQA to demolish the La Mesa Woman's Club facilities (the "Clubhouse") at 5220 Wilson Street and construct a nearly 50 foot tall mixed use development consisting of 49 residential apartments and 3 retail spaces. To attain this intensity of use, the Project employs the State Density Bonus Law ("SDBL"; Gov. Code § 65915 et seq.) to deviate from the standard development requirements of the La Mesa Municipal Code ("LMMC"). Yet, the City is not permitted to deviate from the procedural requirements set forth in the Ralph M. Brown Act (the "Brown Act"), CEQA, and the LMMC, to grant approval for the Project. Below is a brief explanation, highlighting some of the unlawful actions taken by the City through the DAB, ultimately resulting in the body's dissolution specifically due to its approval of the Project.
Though the Church abuts the Clubhouse, and this firm specifically requested notice of all
public hearings relating to the Project, the City failed to afford legal notice in violation of the

PWM126

Brown Act and CEQA. (Gov. Code § 54954.1; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 ["CEQA Guidelines"] § 15087(a)(3).) Though no technical, or other physical, limitation existed, the DAB unlawfully prohibited the public's right to participate in the hearing waiving any right to public oral comments yet, the DAB authorized the applicant to make an extended audio and visual presentation and held over an hour's worth of back-and-forth communications with the applicant and its consultants in assessing the Project. Upon conclusion, the DAB granted approval of the requested SDP and CEQA exemption. This is further detailed in our March 16, 2021 letter of appeal (the "Appeal"), attached hereto as Exhibit "1." The substantive and procedural points shortcomings of the Project described therein are incorporated in full.
Thereafter, on April 7, 2021, this firm delivered to the City a Demand for Cure and Correction (the "Demand") pursuant to the Brown Act to request the unwinding of the DAB's unlawful actions - a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit "2." The procedural shortcomings of the Project described therein are incorporated in full.
In short, the Demand alleges, amongst other things, that the DAB itself was improperly
composed in that its members are senior City staff who serially, or directly, communicated about the Project (and other development proposals), informing one another as to their intent to grant approval, and the conditions of such approval, outside of open, public meetings in violation of basic tenets of open government. (See, e.g., Gov. Code § 54952.2(b) ['"A majority of the members of a legislative body shall not, outside a meeting authorized by this chapter, use a series of communications of any kind, directly or through intermediaries, to discuss, deliberate, or take action on any item of business that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the legislative
body."].)
City Attorney Glenn Sabine, in conference with Community Development Director Kerry Kusiak, and City Manager Greg Humora, acknowledged that Brown Act violations likely existed,
just as the Church claimed. (See Exhibit "3" communications between Mr. Sabine and the
undersigned acknowledging the DAB's Brown Act violations.) Notwithstanding Messrs. Sabine,
Kusiak, and Humora stated intention to request the DAB be terminated, the City Council failed to
cure the alleged violations within the statutory thirty (30) day period afforded for such actions, nor offered "an unconditional commitment to cease, desist from, and not repeat the past action" as is required by law to avoid such litigation. (Gov. Code §§ 54960.1(c), 54960.2(a)(4).)
On or about May 24, 2021, the Church filed litigation with the San Diego Superior Court detailing the DAB's violations under the Brown Act and the LMMC. Attached as Exhibit "4" is the subject Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint filed with the Court. Thereafter, the City Council dissolved the DAB - though it again, failing to offer any indication that it had made an
unconditional commitment as to the other allegations made within the Demand. (Exhibit "5"

PWM127

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV

City Ordinance approved on or about June 8, 2021 dissolving the DA .) Notwithstanding this, the City Council has yet to offer an acknowledgment of the alleged Brown Act violations detailed in the Demand, nor taken steps to unwind the violative actions taken by the DAB. (Gov. Code § 54960.2(a)(4).)

Nor has the City followed through in rehearing the Project under its new SDP review process, as indicated would be done (See Exhibit €33 at p. DA - 2, wherein Mr. Sabine wrote
to the undersigned, ".City staff would be happy to "redo" the March 8, 2021 DAB hearing on the development project planned at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California.") Instead, the City has moved the Project "forward" in presenting the matter to the Planning Commission in direct contradiction to any cognizable notion that the City had cured the Brown Act violations it acknowledged existed with respect to the DAB.
Now, the Commission is faced with the unenviable task of reviewing an invalid, and unsupportable, determination by a defunct body. Rather than following the basic mandates of the law, and taking proactive steps to correct these violations, the City appears ready to compound its unlawful actions and lay the problem at the Commission's feet. The Church strongly recommends the Commission reject the review of this Project out of hand, uphold the appeal, and demand the City staff conform with its own municipal code requirements, the Brown Act, and CEQA. A rescission of the DAB's approval of the Project, including its CEQA exemption, is required under the law, and will only serve to save the City, and thereby its taxpayers, the unnecessary expense of having the Court order this very thing.
The Project, As Posed, Is In Violation Of The California Environmental Quality Act And
Does Not Comply With The California State Density Bonus Law Requiring This Appeal Be
Upheld

As described above, the Project seeks to use the SDBL to demolish the Clubhouse and construct a mixed-use development in its place. In doing so, the Project must comply not only with the SDBL, but with CEQA, the LMMC, and the City's General Plan, Zoning Ordinance and all applicable zoning overlays. In all of these regards, the Project fails.
The subject site is zoned Residential Business and located within the Mixed Use (MU) Overlay. Though mixed use developments are to be expected on such sites, this zoning requires the Project to provide pedestrian friendly housing. (LMMC § 24.18.010(B)(4).) The SDBL does not authorize waivers from such requirements unless a physical constraint exists within the site which would not permit such development. And though there is no such physical constraint, the Project was approved by the DAB to avoid making the improvements which would be required of

1 The Church has not determined whether the actions taken by the City in dissolving the DAB, or in revising the methodology by which an SDP, and this Project, must now be reviewed, comport with the law. Therefore, the Church reserves its consideration of the adequacy of these actions for the time being.

any such development - namely, the installation of a crosswalk, curb ramps, and signalization of the intersection of the heavily-trafficked Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street. The replacement of the Clubhouse, which saw infrequent trips to and from the site, with forty-nine (49)
residential and three (3) commercial units necessarily an already over-used intersection, making it more dangerous individuals seeking to reach public transportation, or the grocery and shopping center just across Grossmont Boulevard. Though the City is aware of these shortcomings, and the inadequacy of the existing road features, it neither required a traffic study nor institution of the improvements already required within the Circulation Element of the General Plan. Unless this Project is required to make these improvements, no other mechanism exists to fulfill the City's
plans.

Backing this up, the Church has submitted its own expert analysis from Wood Environmental, dated November 9, 2020, indicating that the City improperly failed to evaluate the Vehicle Miles Traveled associated with the Project, as required by the State of California's Office of Planning and Research Technical Advisory on Evaluating Transportation Impacts under CEQA and pursuant to Senate Bill 743. Wood Environmental also notes that the City has not required the evaluation of "potential geometric hazards such as sharp turns, dangerous intersections, or points of vehicle/pedestrian traffic conflicts associated with the proposed site plan."
Notwithstanding this, the City knows the area to be hazardous as it has multiple reports of head-
on and fixed object collisions at this location. This exacerbation of existing dangerous conditions is not only unconscionable, but it also runs counter to the law in that the Project was afforded an exemption from CEQA when it quite clearly will create significant impacts on the neighboring
roadway and must be made to mitigate such impacts.
Instead, the City staff attempt to foist a meager $5,000 fair-share contribution for roadway
improvements on the Project. But such mitigation measure cannot be lawfully placed on a
development purportedly exempt from CEQA review - the logic being that a development which is exempt from CEQA cannot be said to generate potentially significant impacts and, therefore, may not be required to provide mitigation where no impacts exist. (Anderson First Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173 1186-87.) Though the City appears to understand
this conundrum, in its desire to offer an exemption from review, the City nevertheless elected to
suggest that the fair share condition be imposed on the development in violation of CEQA. (See,
Exhibit "5" Communications from Community Development Director Kerry Kusiak.) This blatant violation of CEQA must be corrected by upholding the appeal, denying the CEQA exemption recommended by City staff, and requiring a complete and unbiased analysis of the Project's traffic impacts so that appropriate mitigation measures may be instituted. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102.)
The City also uses SDBL waivers in a manner that does not comport with the law in attempting to permit the Project the right to avoid compliance with the LMMC's requirements for the pedestrian realm. (LMMC § 24.18.020(E).) As mentioned previously, a waiver may only be

PWM129

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
July 14, 2021
Page 5 of 7

afforded to the Project when a "development standard will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development.' (Gov. Code § 65915(e)(1).) Notwithstanding this, the Project proposes, and the DAB approved, the encroachment of balconies into the pedestrian realm because of "cost impacts [necessary] to incorporate the Open Space requirement and private balconies.' This waiver request is clearly impermissible as it does not pertain to physical site limitations precluding construction but is instead merely tied to the development's potential profitability. Thus, the proposal is in violation of the SDBL and must all similar waivers must be stricken from
the Project.

Nor may a development use the SDBL to overcome health and safety requirements
imposed under the LMMC. Yet, that is precisely what the Project proposes, and what the DAB approved in permitting reductions in standard parking space and drive aisle dimensions though there can be no doubt that such cutbacks will endanger life and property by increasing the likelihood and frequency of car accidents. The City's parking space and drive aisle requirements are not randomly devised, but rather carefully determined to afford the public safe conditions within parking facilities. (LMMC § 22.112.010(B).) To reduce such safety conditions under the
guise of an SDBL waiver runs directly counter to the law. (Gov. Code § 65915(e)(1) [Nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted to require a local government to waive or reduce development standards if the waiver or reduction would have a specific, adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5, upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact.] Emphasis added.) Given this, the Project cannot be approved as proposed in light of the immediate health and safety impacts raised by its reductions in standards attendant to the protection of the
public.

Further, the DAB blatantly disregarded the facts that its members, and City staff, knew to
be true, that the Clubhouse is a historically important site in the region for a number of reasons. (Exhibits 6-8 [Emails from Planner Allyson Kinnard, Community Development Director Kusiak,
and (then-assistant) City Manager Greg Humora, each imparting the significance of the Clubhouse, as well as the need for CEQA review, if not the preparation of an environmental impact report, to permit its modification].) Simply speaking, the Clubhouse is a historically important site due to its distinctive architecture, the well-known and respected architect that designed and oversaw its construction, and the La Mesa Woman's Club's many, extensive contributions to the City of La
Mesa and the region - likely meeting three of the four criteria for historical designation under State
law, and up to six of eight criteria for designation under the LMMC. (Public Resources Code § 5024.1; LMMC § 25.03.010(A thru F).) The Project's historical report (Historical Resource Assessment in Support of the CityMark Mixed-Use Development Project, La Mesa, San Diego County, California, dated August 19, 2020) is clearly deficient and appears to be directly intended to give the impression that the site should not be considered historic notwithstanding the facts.

PWM130

The Project report indicates that the project architect was Herluf Jensen Brydegaard described by Modern San Diego as "[n]ationally recognized for his school designs." (https://modernsandiego.com/people/herluf-jensen-brydegaard).Three of Brydegaard's works were recently represented in a tour of historically significant architectural works in just the Clairemont community of San Diego, including the Clairemont Branch Public Library, the Del Sol Academy, and the George W. Marston Junior High School, all of which have distinctly similar architectural characteristics to those found at the Clubhouse.
http://www.sohosandiego.org/tourbooklets/clairemontTour061616.pdf.)And hisworks are understood to be part of the historical archive kept by the San Diego Historical Society. The Project report clearly offers little insight in that it describes Brydegaard's career as "long" - though Brydegaard had a prolific career as acknowledged by the report, he passed away at age 45, in 1960, the same year the Clubhouse was opened. Such an obvious lack of care in the preparation of a historical analysis should be offered no weight when faced with the obvious value inherent in the
site.

Further, the report acknowledges that the "La Mesa Women's [sic] Club made many contributions to the betterment of the region" but goes on to say that it no significant events are associated with the history of La Mesa. This runs counter to basic logic in that this service organization in existence since 1902 held meetings for five decades in the Clubhouse where all of their good works and "many contributions" were devised and planned out, but because little research was performed (or disclosed) the report declares no historical value should be assigned to the Clubhouse, and that no individuals important in local history are associated with the site. In short, the report is clearly lacking in objectivity and intended to permit the demolition of a historically important feature of the La Mesa community.
To that end, the Church has hired its own historical expert, Kiley Wallace, who has indicated that the Clubhouse does, in fact, have historical value as to its architectural features similar to others he has promoted successfully for designation in the San Diego County region. Mr. Wallace will provide further details on this in his own correspondence and will review the site for nomination for historical designation.
In light of these facts, the City must require further analysis under LMMC Title 25 to determine the historic nature of the Clubhouse and to determine whether it may be demolished at all. This further portends that the SDBL may not be applicable to the Project in that historically designated sites may not be afforded waivers or incentives by law. (Gov. Code §§ 65915(d)(1)(B), 65915(e)(1).)

Conclusion
The Project, as proposed and previously approved by the void determination made by defunct, must be sent back for further revision in compliance with local and state law. On its face, the Project will generate potentially significant impacts on the environment such that an exemption

under CEQA is impermissible, it fails to comport with its zoning and General Plan requirements and implements the SDBL in a manner not allowed under the law. In light of these facts, and the law, the Planning Commission is obligated to uphold the Church's appeal.

Re: Appeal of March 8, 2021 Development Advisory Board Determination Regarding Project No. 2020-16

Dear Ms. Wiegelman:
This correspondence shall serve as a request to appeal the March 8, 2021 City of La Mesa (**City") Development Advisory Board ("DAB") approval of the CityMark Communities LLC
(*Applicant") development project, and exemption from the California Environmental Quality Act
("CEQA"), at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California, also known as Project No. 2020-16 (the
"Project').

Appeal of DAB Determination

Pursuant to La Mesa Municipal Code sections 2.08.051 and 24.02.035, this firm, acting on behalf of its client, St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California ("St. Luke's") located at 5150 Wilson Street, hereby timely appeals the DAB's March 8, 2021 approval of the Project and its exemption from review under CEQA, and attaches a check in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) (a copy of which is presented with the electronic version of the correspondence as
Exhibit "A"). As the neighboring property owner representing the interests of its congregation as well as the community at large, St. Luke's files this appeal in light of specific violations of CEQA, the La Mesa Municipal Code, including but not limited to the Project's zoning requirements and concomitant development standards, the California State Density Bonus Law (Government Code
§ 65915 et seq.), and the City's General Plan as iterated in the letter delivered to the DAB on
March 8, 2021 and attached hereto as Exhibit "B."

In addition, certain representations made at the subject DAB hearing indicate that the Project is further violative of the law. We lay several of these issues out below:
1) In expectation of the Project's residents accessing the Grossmont Shopping Center directly across Grossmont Boulevard, the City's staff report to the DAB, at page 2, acknowledges that the "intersection [of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street] is not signalized and is lacking curb

PWM134

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Wiegelman, La Mesa City Clerk
March 16, 2021
Page 2 of 6

ramps and crosswalks." The Applicant's traffic engineer, during the public comment portion of the DAB hearing, indicated that the Project would install a crosswalk across Grossmont Boulevard.
Yet, an examination of the Project plans, as reflected in the staff report, indicates no such street improvements are offered, nor iS the City's approval conditioned on the installation of a safe, a signalized crosswalk at this intersection - though it is well understood to be a dangerous location in light of the curvature of the street and speed of the automobiles moving through the area. Instead, the staff report, at page 5, provides "[a]s a condition of approval, the applicant will pay a fair-share contribution towards crosswalk improvements to the intersection." Such a mitigation measure is improper in the following respects (beyond those points made in our March 8, 2021 comment letter to the DAB):
a. First, the imposition of this condition of approval shows the DAB, and city staff, recognize the intersection requires a crosswalk in light of the Project's addition of
49 households of new residents, and the additional pedestrian traffic expected from the Project's three retail spaces, directly accessing the Grossmont Shopping Center for shopping or parking purposes (the latter especially, in light of the Project's deficient parking space supply). This dangerous condition (i.e., no safe crosswalk, stop signs, or signals) will be heightened by the addition of dozens, if not hundreds, of additional individuals trying to cross Grossmont Boulevard on a daily basis - a
clear and unmistakable impact requiring review and mitigation under CEQA. Yet,
the DAB approved an exemption from CEQA review declaring that there is no
reasonable possibility that a significant impact exists pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c). This determination does not comport with the facts, nor the City's determination that a condition on the Project is required to contribute towards the safety of this intersection. On this basis alone, the DAB's approval of a categorical exemption is without merit. b. Second, the DAB's approval of a fair-share contribution, on its face, indicates that
the City expects other neighboring future developments to contribute to the
correction of the unsafe conditions at the Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street
intersection due to the foreseeable addition of more pedestrians and vehicles due to residential and commercial development in the area. This, too, indicates that the cumulative impact exception found at CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(b) ("All [categorical] exemptions.. are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of
successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.") applies, such that the DAB could not lawfully approve a categorical CEQA exemption to this Project. c. Third, the imposition of a mitigation measure, such as a condition requiring a street improvement, or payment of a fair-share contribution toward such an improvement,
inherently indicates that the Project is expected to result in a significant impact. In such an instance, no categorical CEQA exemption may be granted. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102.) Notwithstanding this, DAB chairman, and Community Development

PWM135

Director, Kerry Kusiak's attempt to waive this legal impropriety by arguing that the $5,000 contribution to street improvements is a feature of the Project rather than a condition imposed by the City runs counter to the plain language of the approval - the fair-share contribution is "a condition of approval" (staff report, page 5), and "[t]he applicant shall provide a fee in-lieu of $5,000 [sic] for construction of an ADA compliant curb ramp at the southeast corner of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street" (DAB Resolution No. DAB-2021-xX, at page 4, Engineering Condition of Approval #21).
Moreover, the argument that this $5,000 contribution is a feature of the Project offered by the Applicant, rather than a mitigation measure imposed by the City, is patently absurd. The Applicant repeatedly indicates, in its own words, when (improperly) seeking waivers under the State Density Bonus Law, that the Project would be financially infeasible due to "*cost impacts" if it were to meet the City's development standards (see staff report, Attachment E, pages 2-5) - so, the Council would have to believe that the Applicant is claiming financial difficulty and simultaneously giving away cash to the City even though it was under no obligation
to do so (and that there no Project impact to this intersection dictate the imposition
of a mitigation measure). Such efforts to avoid CEQA must be avoided as an affront to the community this Council and its staff serve.
As further described in our March 8, 2021 (Exhibit "B"), this mitigation measure also runs afoul of the basic tenet of CEQA jurisprudence that payment into a fair-share fee is only
permissible if the fees are "part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency commits itself to implementing.' (Anderson First Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173, 1187.) There appears to be no such plan, commitment, nor funds to implement, the construction of a crosswalk across Grossmont Boulevard at Wilson Street, nor any indication
as to how the $5,000 condition of approval was determined to result in a "fair-share" of the overall
expense in light of the Project's impacts this is, of course, because there has been no lawful review of the Project's impacts at this intersection in direct violation of CEQA.
The City's Design Review Board, also on March 8, 2021, conditioned the Project's approval on the Applicant's provision of a traffic analysis to prove that the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street was inherently dangerous requiring deviation from the City's standard public realm improvements in the Mixed Use ("MU") zone. This condition indicates that the Applicant specifically seeks a waiver of required development standards due to
a hazardous condition to health and safety at this intersection (i.e., by adding numerous new
pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles). Whether the waiver is granted, or not, the fact remains that
the City acknowledges the Project will generate impacts at this intersection requiring review and mitigation measures such that a categorical CEQA exemption may not be approved in light of CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c).
