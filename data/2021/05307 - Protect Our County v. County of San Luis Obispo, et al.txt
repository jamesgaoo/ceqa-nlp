2 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code Section 21167.7, and Code of
Civil Procedure Section 388, that on March 10, 2021, Petitioner Protect Our County filed a
4 Petition for Writ of Mandamus against Respondents County of San Luis Obispo and Board of
Supervisors of the County of San Luis Obispo ("Respondents") in the above-referenced Court.

6 This litigation challenges the actions of Respondents in connection with the adoption of

7 Resolution No. 2021-033 denying an appeal of the Planning Commission's decision to approve

8 a Conditional Use Permit (DRC2018-00036) submitted by 13350 River Road LLC (formerly
9 Helios Dayspring) ("Real Party") for the establishment of a cannabis operation facility that
10 includes up to three acres of outdoor cultivation in hoop structures, up to 22,000 square feet of
11 indoor mixed-light cultivation, up to 27,570 square feet of ancillary cannabis nursery,
12 operation of a non-storefront dispensary and the modification of parking requirements

13 ("Project") and approving the Project. The Respondents adopted a Mitigated Negative
14 Declaration ("MND") for the Project because they erroneously determined that there is no fair

15 argument that the Project may have a significant effect on the environment. The Petition
16 further names 13350 River Road LLC as Real Party in Interest.
17 A copy of the Petition for Writ of Mandamus is enclosed herewith.

2 INTRODUCTION

3 1. On February 9, 2021 the County of San Luis Obispo ("County") by and through

4 the Board of Supervisors (collectively "Respondents") adopted Resolution No. 2021-033
Conditional Use Permit 5 denying an appeal of the Planning Commission's decision to approve a
6 (DRC2018-00036) submitted by 13350 River Road LLC (formerly Helios Dayspring) ("Real
7 Party") for the establishment of a cannabis operation facility that includes up to three acres of
8 outdoor cultivation in hoop structures, up to 22,000 square feet of indoor mixed-light cultivation,

Q up to 27,570 square feet of ancillary cannabis nursery, operation of a non-storefront dispensary
10 and the modification of parking requirements ("Project") and approving the Project. The

11 Respondents adopted a Mitigated Negative Declaration (*MND*) for the Project because they
12 erroneously determined that there is no fair argument that the Project may have a significant
13 effect on the environment.

14 2. The Project is located at 13350 River Road in the census-designated area of San

15 Miguel, within unincorporated San Luis Obispo County in California and is within the Paso
16 Robles Groundwater Basin. The Paso Robles Groundwater Basin has been assigned a Level of

17 Severity III impacted groundwater basin. In order to meet the Project's water demands, the Real

18 Parties pian to utilize the existing on-site well as a water source. The MND asserted the Project's

19 water demands would total 6.44 acre feet per year of water (AFY). This value was not

20 calculated by a licensed Professional Geologist, Certified Engineering Geologist, or Certified
21 Hydrogeologist, or other expert on water demand as approved by the Director of Planning and

22 Building. Instead, this value was calculated based on incorrect water usage assumptions and

23 units of measurements take from an Environmental Impact Report prepared for the Santa Cruz
24 County Commercial Cannabis Cultivation and Manufacturing Regulations and Licensing
25 Program ("Santa Cruz County EIR"). Therefore, the MND failed to analyze the actual water
26 usage and a fair argument exists that the Project may have a significant impact on water.
27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

3. With regard to greenhouse gases, the MND asserts that the Project is expected to

2 produce 1,719 metric tons of CO2 per year. However, the MND does not provide the

3 calculations for these estimates. The MND also estimates that this CO2 level would be reduced

4 to 621 metric tons of CO2 per year due to the implementation of an Energy Conservation Plan.

5 However, the Energy Conservation Plan has not been developed yet nor does the MND cite any

6 evidence to support this claim. The MND also fails to account for other greenhouse gasses in its

7 analysis, such as methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone. Therefore, a fair argument exists that the
8 Project may have a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions.

9 4. With regard to noise impacts, the MND states the Project will involve the use of
10 HVAC and odor management systems associated with the proposed greenhouse and former
11 winery building which would be expected to generate noise levels of 31 dBA at the northern
12 property line and 32 dBA the eastern property line. Additionally, the existing winery building to
13 be re-purposed for cannabis processing and non-storefront dispensary and nursery will also
14 involve the operation of HVAC and odor management systems which would result in a noise
15 level of 52 dBA at the property line. However, the MND does not cite any evidence to support
16 this analysis. Furthermore, the MND also fails to specify the sound measurements for other
17 sources of noise such as construction and vehicle transportation.
18 5. The MND contains mitigation measures that are based on conclusory assumptions

19 and values that rely on by unreliable evidence. A fair argument exists that the Project may have
20 significant impacts on the environment thus warranting preparation of an Environmental Impact

21 Report ("EIR").

22 6. The MND concludes the Project will not create a cumulatively considerable
23 impact on the environment even if all 114 of the current applications for cannabis cultivation

24 activities will be approved. However, this assertion erroneously considers each project within

25 their own vacuums rather than in aggregate. Therefore, a fair argument exists that that Project

26 will contribute to a significant cumulative impact on the environment.

1 7. Petitioner Protect Our County ("Petitioner") is concerned with the Respondents'

2 failure to conduct adequate environmental review under the California Environmental Quality

3 Act ("CEQA").

4 8. Petitioner challenges the approval of the Project and the adoption of the MND on
5 the grounds that the Project does not comply with the California Environmental Quality Act

6 ("CEQA" - Pub. Resources Code § 21000 et seq.) because, inter alia, the MND failed to analyze
7 the actual water demand and greenhouse gas emissions of the Project. Furthermore, the MND
8 failed to provide adequate support of the Project's compliance with state and local air quality

0 standards or adequate mitigation measures for the Project air quality and greenhouse gas impacts.
10 Therefore, a fair argument exists that the Project may have significant impacts to water and air

11 quality, The MND also provides an insufficient analysis regarding the Project's noise impacts
12 and contribution to cumulative impacts.

13 9. On February 10, 2021, Respondents filed a Notice of Determination and, pursuant

14 to Public Resources Code Section 21167, this action was filed within 30 days thereof.

16 PARTIES

17 10. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 9 as if fully set

27 Approval of the Project will adversely affect the interests of Petitioner Protect Our

28 County. Petitioner Protect Our County has a strong interest in the preservation of the

1 environment. Members of Petitioner Protect Our County reside in the County of San Luis

2 Obispo, and include residents affected by the Project and whose interests will be adversely
3 affected by the violations of CEQA. Approval of the Project and adoption of an MND will

4 adversely affect these interests of Petitioner Protect Our County and its members. Protect Our

5 County was formed subsequent to Project approval. Its members have expressed their concerns

6 and commented on the Project during the administrative proceedings wherein the Project was
7  considered. Therefore, Petitioner Protect Our County has exhausted its administrative remedies

8 and has standing pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21177(c). Accordingly, Petitioner

9 Protect Our County is an "aggrieved person" within the meaning of Public Resources Code
10 21177. The claims asserted and relief requested are broad-based, so that participation in the
11 litigation by individual members is not required.

12 20. Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to California Code of Civil

13 Procedure §§ 1085 and 1094.5; California Public Resources Code § 21167; CEQA Guidelines
14 § 15112; the Constitution of the State of California; the Constitution of the United States; and

20 22. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition by
21 themselves or others, raising each and every issue known to them before Respondents, in
22 compliance with Public Resources Code § 21177, Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 and
23 1094.5, and other applicable laws.
24 23. Notice of the filing of this action as required by Public Resources Code

2 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

U)
4 Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act [Public Resources Code $ 21000 et seq.]

5 24. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 23 as if fully

6 set forth herein.

7 25. Respondents' adoption of an MND constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion

8 because a fair argument exists that the Project may have a significant effect on the

9

10 environment. "With certain limited exceptions, a public agency must prepare an EIR whenever

11 substantial evidence supports a fair argument that a proposed project 'may have a significant

12 effect on the environment.173 Protect Niles v. City of Fremont (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 1129,
1138-1139.

13 26.

14 CEQA requires that Respondents adequately and accurately disclose, evaluate,

15 and mitigate the impacts of the Project. The MND failed to adequately evaluate and provide
mitigation for the impacts of the Project on water and greenhouse gas as well as the noise from

16

17 the Project. The MND also failed to adequate analyze the cumulative impacts of the Project.
The Real Parties admitted that the Project's water demand would be 6.6 AFY. However, the
18 MND's analysis was based on the erroneous calculations and assumptions. Furthermore, the
19 MND failed to provide its calculations for the Project's projected greenhouse gas emissions. The

20 Project also is likely to violate County noise standards, and the MND's cumulative impacts

21

22 analysis is inadequate. A fair argument exists that the Project may have a significant impact on
the environment. "The fair argument standard is *low threshold' test for requiring the

23 preparation of an EIR. It is a question of law, not fact, whether a fair argument exists, and the

24 courts owe no deference to the lead agency's determination. Review is de novo, with a

25 preference for resolving doubts in favor of environmental review." Protect Niles v. City of

9 VIII

10 INJUNCTION

11 29. Petitioner hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 28 as if fully
12 set forth herein.

13 30. An actual controversy has arisen concerning Respondents' failure to comply with
14 CEQA (Pub. Resources Code § 21000 et seq.), as set forth above.

15 31. As a result of the above-alleged violations of CEQA, Respondents have failed to
16 conduct adequate environmental review as required by law and, thus, have failed to proceed in
17 a manner required by law in approving the Project.

18 32. At all times mentioned herein, Respondents have been able to comply with
19 CEQA, prepare adequate environmental review, and comply with all relevant provisions of
20 law. Notwithstanding such an ability, Respondents have failed and continue to fail to perform

21 their duty to comply with CEQA and all other relevant provisions of law.

22 33. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis allege, that Respondents
23 are threatening to proceed with development of the Project in the near future. Said
24 implementation of the Project will irreparably harm the environment and will result in
25 significant and unmitigated adverse environmental impacts.

26 34. Petitioner possesses no speedy, adequate remedy at law, in that implementation
27 and development in connection with the Project will permanently and forever harm, injure,

28

7

degrade, and impact the environmental values of the County of San Luis Obispo and the State
2 of California. Petitioner will suffer irreparable and permanent injuries if Respondents' actions

3 described herein are not set aside.

35. A stay and/or restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunction

5 should issue restraining Respondents from proceeding with development of the Project.

6 36. In order to preserve the status quo, a stay and/or restraining order and
7 preliminary and permanent injunction should issue staying Respondents' approval of the

8 Project and adoption of the MND.

12 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:

14 aside: (1) any and all Project approvals, including, but not limited to, approval of Conditional
15 Use Permit (DRC2018-00036) for the construction of an indoor cannabis cultivation facility and

17 outdoor cultivation in hoop structures, up to 22,000 square feet of indoor mixed-light cultivation,
18 up to 27,570 square feet of ancillary cannabis nursery, operation of a non-storefront dispensary
19 and the modification of parking requirements, and (2) adoption of an MND for the Project.
20 2. For an order staying Respondents or other Project applicants from engaging in
21 any activity pursuant to the Project until the environmental review and the Project complies with
22 California statues and regulations, including but not limited to the requirements of CEQA.
23 3. For reasonable attorneys' fees, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure
24 1021.5, and other provision of the law.

Re: Notice of Intent to Commence Litigation

Pursuant to the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5, this letter will
serve as notice that Protect Our County will commence litigation against the County of San Luis Obispo and Board of Supervisors of the County of San Luis Obispo ("Respondents").
This litigation challenges the actions of Respondents in connection with the adoption of Resolution No. 2021-033 denying an appeal of the Planning Commission's decision to approve a Conditional Use Permit (DRC2018-00036) submitted by 13350 River Road LLC (formerly Helios Dayspring) ("Real Party") for the establishment of a cannabis operation facility that includes up to three acres of outdoor cultivation in hoop structures, up to 22,000 square feet of indoor mixed-light cultivation, up to 27,570 square feet of ancillary cannabis nursery, operation of a non-storefront dispensary and the modification of parking requirements ("Project") and approving the Project. The Respondents adopted a Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") for the Project because they erroneously determined that there is no fair argument that the Project may have a significant effect on the environment.
This litigation has been commenced, inter alia, because the actions listed in the preceding paragraph do not comply with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.).
