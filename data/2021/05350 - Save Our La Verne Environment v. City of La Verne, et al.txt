VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

CAUSES OF ACTION

m v1 0 E FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION Abuse of Discretion Violation of CEQA, Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.
29. Petitioner realleges and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every --

allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 28.

30. In approving the Project as described herein, Respondents prejudicially abused their

8 discretion in violation of CEQA pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21168 and Code of

9 Civil Procedure section 1094.5, because the City certified an EIR that fails to include

10 information necessary for informed decision making and informed public participation,

11 including information necessary to reach informed conclusions regarding the significance of the

12 Project's environmental impacts to traffic.

31.
13 The Final EIR contains an inadequate traffic analysis as it relies upon data from

14 2011 regarding four of the study area intersections and traffic counts conducted on August 5,

15 2020 during lockdown due to the COVID pandemic. Additionally, the traffic analysis fails to

16 analysis the key intersections with Amherst Street and daily use of nearby facilities. As a result,

17 the EIR's determination regarding traffic impacts, including safety is not supported by
substantial evidence.
18
32.
19 Under Impact T-2, the EIR determined that the Project would result in significant

20 and unavoidable VMT impacts under existing and cumulative conditions. The City's

21 determination that there are no feasible alternatives or mitigation measures is not supported by
substantial evidence.
22
33.
23 The EIR fails to comply with the requirements of CEQA in that it fails to

24 adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the Project's cumulative environmental impacts as

25 required by law. CEQA requires an EIR to discuss a project's significant cumulative effect on

26 the environment in conjunction with other closely related past, present and reasonably

27 foreseeable probable future projects. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21083(b); CEQA Guidelines, §§

28 15130(b)(1)(A), 15355.) The term "[c]umulative impacts' refer[s] to two or more individual

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 8

p

NO0P0 N effects which, when considered together, are considerable or which compound or increase other
environmental impacts." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15355.) An EIR must discuss if the
"cumulative impact may be significant and the project's incremental effect, though individually
limited, is cumulatively considerable." (Id., § 15064(h)(1).) "Cumulatively considerable'
means that the incremental effects of past projects, the effects of other current projects, and the
effects of probable future projects." (Id.)

34.

8 A legally adequate "cumulative impacts analysis" views a particular project over

9 time and in conjunction with other related past, present, and reasonably foreseeable probable

10

11 future projects whose impacts might compound or interrelate with those of the project at hand.

12 "Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant projects
taking place over a period of time." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15355(b); see Communities for a

13 Better Environment v. California Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App 4th 98, 117 [*The

14 cumulative impact from several projects is the change in the environment which results from

15. the incremental impact of the project when added to other closely related past, present, and

16 reasonably foreseeable probable future projects..."].)
35.

17 The EIR's cumulative traffic analysis fails to adequately consider and address

:18

19 current and future projects such as nearby apartment building at Garey and Bonita and proposed
projects that include high density housing on Fruit.

20 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

21 36. (Violation of General Plan Laws - Government Code §§ 65300 et seq.; Code of Civil Procedure § 1094.5)

22 37. Petitioner realleges and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 35.

23 The State Planning and Zoning Law, Government Code section 65000 et seq.,

24

25 establishes the General Plan as the constitution for all future development, to which any local

26 decision affecting land use and development must conform. (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board
of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 570.) Every city and county must adopt a

27 "comprehensive, long-tern General Plan for the physical development of the city or county

28 § (Gov't Code § 65300.) The California Supreme Court has described the General Plan as the
"constitution for all future developments." (Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural El Dorado
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 9

County v. Board of Supervisor ("FUTURE") (1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1336, citing Citizens

2 of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors, supra, 52 Cal.3d at 570.) The Supreme Court
.u described "the function of a general plan as "constitution," and labeled it the "basic land use
charter governing the direction of future land use" in the locality. (Lesher Communications,
Lo Inc. v. City of Walnut (1950) 52 Cal.3d 531, 540, DaVita v. County of Napa (1995) 9.Cal.3d
vo 763,773.) The propriety of an agency's decision affecting land use and development depends
7 on the project's consistency with the objectives, policies and land uses specified in the General
8 Plan.

9 38. Local land use and development decisions must also be consistent with the

10 applicable general plan. (FUTURE, supra, 62 Cal.App.4th at 1336; Gov't Code, § 65860(a).)
11 The requirement that local land use decisions adhere to the governing General Plan is known as
12 the "consistency doctrine." (Lesher Communications, Inc., supra, 9 Cal.3d at p. 541.) This
13 doctrine is "the linchpin of California's land use and development laws; it is the principle which
14 infused the concept of planned growth with the force of law." (Ibid, citing deBottari v. City
15 Council (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 1204, 1213.) A project is consistent with the General Plan if "it |
16 will further the objectives and policies of the General Plan and not obstruct their attainment." :
17 (FUTURE, supra, 62 Cal.App.4th at p. 1336; Friends of Lagoon Valley v. City of Vacaville

18 (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 807, 817.) While a court accords deference to an agency's
19 interpretation of its general plan and various elements, an abuse of discretion is established if the

20 agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law, its decision is not supported by findings, |
21 or the findings are not supported by substantial evidence. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5;
22 Pfeiffer v. City of Sunnyvale City Council (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1552, 1563.) A project need
23 not be in perfect conformity with each and every General Plan policy as no project can
24 completely satisfy every General Plan Policy. (Sequoyah Hills Homeowners Assn v. City of
25 Oakland (1993) 23 Cal.App.4th 704, 719.) The Town, however, cannot ignore General Plan
26 goals, policies and objectives that are by their very terms fundamental, mandatory and clear. An|
27 action, however, must be consistent with the very specific and mandatory policies of the general
28 plan. (Endangered Habitats League, Inc. v. County of Orange (2005) 131 Cal.App 4th 777,
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 10

1 785-786, 789; FUTURE, supra, 62 Cal .App.4th at 1342.) Thus, a project is inconsistent with the

2 General Plan, and thus cannot be approved, where it violates such a policy or policies. (Id.)

3 39. The Project is not consistent with several of the City's mandatory General Plan

4 policies: Policy LU-3.1 (Preserve the distinctive character of neighborhoods); Policy T-2.5

5 (Relieve congestion and improve air quality throughout our valley); Policy T-3.2 (Decrease

6 traffic noise, volumes, speed, and congestion); Policy RM-5.1 (Reduce vehicular air pollution); -
[ Policy RM-8.1 (Strive for economic stability, environmental responsibility and a high quality of |

8 life); Policy N.3.1 (Prevent increases in traffic-related noise); and Policy H-4.1 (Provide a range |

9 of residential development types in La Verne).

10 40. As the Project is inconsistent with the policies of the General Plan, the City's

11 approval of the Project is contrary to law and constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

12 PRAYER

13 Wherefore, Petitioner respectfully requests the following relief and entry of judgment as
14 follows:

15 1. That this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate ordering Respondents to:
16 (a) vacate and set aside its approval of the Project grounds that it violates the
17 California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq.;
18 (b) vacate and set aside its approval of the Project grounds that it violates the
19 State Planning and Zoning Law, Government Code, section 65300 et seq.

20 (c) vacate and set aside of Respondents' Resolution No. 21-18, Resolution No.

21 21-16, Resolution No. 21-17 and Ordinance No. 1099;
: 22 (d) suspend all activity that could result in any change or alteration to the

23 physical environment until Respondents have taken such actions as may be necessary to bring

24 their determination, findings or decision regarding the Project into compliance with CEQA;
25 2. For a stay, preliminary injunction and permanent injunction restraining City of La

26 Verne, the City Council of City of La Verne, and Real Party in Interest and their respective
27 agents, employees, officers and representatives from undertaking any activity to implement the
28 Project in any way pending full compliance with CEQA, and the CEQA Guidelines,
