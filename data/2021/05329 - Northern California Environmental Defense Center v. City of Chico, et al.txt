2 Notice of Intent to Adopt a Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Bruce Road Reconstruction

3 Project, which proposed the reconstruction and widening of an approximately 2-mile segment

4 Of Bruce Road from State Route 32 to Skyway utilizing roller-compacted concrete pavement.

5 The proposed "complete streets" improvements include widening Bruce Road from an existing

6 2-land arterial roadway to a 4-land arterial roadway, and replacement of the existing two-lane

7 "functionally obsolete" Bruce Road bridge over Little Chico Creek with a new four-lane bridge

8 structure. The new, approximately 96-foot long by 96.5-feet wide bridge will accommodate forut

9 lanes of traffic, a center median, pedestrian/bicycle facilities consisting of a Class I bike path on

10 the west side of Bruce Road, and a sidewalk on the east side. The new bridge will be comprised

11 of three-span, cast-in-place, reinforced concrete slab superstructure founded on pile-supported

12 abutments and a16-inch diameter multi-column piers supported on spread footings. The ultimatel

13 roadway design includes construction of the following: a 14-foot landscaped center median;

17 also includes storm drainage improvements such as bio-retention facilities, drainage pipe,

18 manholes, and curb inlets, as well as" minor" extensions of sewer facilities "where required."

19 The City will be installing all infrastructure improvements detailed herein, except for a few a

20 limited frontage improvements (e.g., sidewalk and parkway strips) on the east side of Bruce Road

21 that will be installed by others in conjunction with the requirements of adjacent private

22 subdivisions. The project design includes a 105' wide Right of Way for the entire two-mile

23 length of the reconstruction (and expansion) of Bruce Road. [25.38 acres]

24 17. An Initial Study for environmental review was prepared for the project; based
25 upon the information within the Initial Study, the Public Works-Engineering Department

26 recommended that a Mitigated Negative Declaration be adopted for the project pursuant to the

27 California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

28 18. A thirty (30) day public review period was conducted on the Draft Initial Study/

5

1 Proposed Mitigated Negative Declaration (IS/MND), commencing on September 23, 2020

2 through October 23, 2020. Respondents proposed to conduct an administrative review, only,

3 without any public hearings before the City Planning Commission or the City Council.

4 19, Petitioner, its supporters, and other members of the environmental community and

5 general public submitted numerous Comment letters; and Petitioner objected to the lack of any

6 public hearings.

7 20. On November 25, 2020, City Public Works-Engineering Staff responded to the

8 Public Comments submitted by Petitioner and other members of the public and the City adopted

9 the proposed IS/MND and filed its Notice of Determination with the Butte County Clerk.

10 21. On December 7, 2020, Petitioner timely filed its Appeal to the City Council,

11 pursuant to Chico Municipal Code Section 1.40.060 and Public Resources Code (PRC) section

12 21151, subd. (c), including a list of Issues Raised on Appeal.

13 22. On February 2, 2021, the City Council heard and considered the Appeal of

14. Petitioner and, based on the City Staff Report and other documentation in the record, the City

15 Council denied the Appeal of Petitioner and adopted the IS/MND.

16 23. On February 3, 2021, the City filed its Notice of Determination with the Butte

17 County Clerk.

18 24. On March 4, 2021, Petitioner transmitted its Notice of Intent to File Suit Alleging

19 Claims Pursuant to CEQA, pursuant to PRC section 21167.5. [True Copy with Proof of Service

20 on Respondents, marked "Exhibit A" is attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.]

21 25, On March 5, 2021, Petitioner filed its verified Petition for Administrative and

22 Traditional Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief herein.

23 26. The grounds for this challenge are that the Respondents City of Chico and the

24 Chico City Council have abused their discretion delegated to them under the California

25 Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) [Public Resources Code (PRC) section 21000 et seq.l,

26 pursuant to sections 21168 and 21168.5, to the prejudice of Petitioners and the general public, by

27 failing to proceed in a manner required by law, as set forth hereinbelow.

28

6

1 27. In addition, Petitioners challenge the findings, decisions, and actions made and

2 taken by Respondents City and City Council based their abuse of discretion delegated to them

3 under the State Planning and Zoning Act [Government Code section 65300 et seq.] to the

4. prejudice of the Petitioners and the general public, due the legal inadequacy of the City General

5 Plan adopted in 2011 and the outdated Final EIR (FEIR) certified in 2011, based on the lack of

6 substantial credible evidence to support the findings, decisions, and actions of the City Council.

7 28. Wherefore, Petitioner respectfully requests the Court to grant this verified Petition

8 and issue a Peremptory Writ of Administrative Mandate or other appropriate Writ, commanding,

9 directing, and ordering Respondents to vacate and set aside their findings, decisions, and actions

10 for the adoption and certification of the IS/MND for this project as set forth below

11 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

14 29. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporate herein by reference each and every allegation

15 contained in paragraphs 1 through 28, inclusive, as though fully set forth herein.
16 30. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law as follows.

17 A. Respondents failed to provide an adequate analysis of the potentially significant

18 effects caused to the biological resources adversely impacted by the project, as set forth in the

19 Comments submitted by AquAlliance in its letter dated November 2, 2020 and failed to respond

20 to these Comments in the City's Response to these Comments, regarding impacts to flora and thei

21 potentially significant effects on federally and state protected Wetlands and Dependent Species

22 and Fisheries, and the alternative to the proposed demolition and construction of a new

23 bridge over Little Chico Creek.

24 B. Respondents failed to provide an adequate response to the issues raised by John Merz

25 in his Comments regarding the potentially significant effects on the biological resources of Little

26 Chico Creek and his proposed mitigation measure or alternative of re-locating the proposed

27 bridge over Little Chico Creek to another location west of Bruce Road.

2 submitted by Petitioner in its Comment letter, dated October 24, 2020, and in its Issues Raised on

3 Appeal, dated December 7, 2020, including the fact that the total area of this project is not

4 adequately disclosed, and that a project of this size requires an Environmental Impact Report.

5 D. Respondents failed to address and provide an adequate analysis of the Carbon Impacts

6 (GHHs) of this project.

7 E. Respondents failed to provide an adequate Air Quality impact study and adequate

8 mitigation of the significant adverse impacts from the cumulative traffic from the proposed

11 the record that the City Staff complied with SB 743, regarding the preparation of the VMT

12 analysis required for the Bruce Road project,

13 F. Respondents failed to provide an adequate analysis of the growth-inducing impacts thai

14 will be caused by this project and are projected to rely upon this project.

22 31. Thus, Respondents have abused their discretion to the prejudice of Petitioners and

23 the general public by failing to proceed in the manner required by law, in violation of PRC

24 sections 21168 and 21168.5, and Respondents

25 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

26 [Declaratory Relief- Rights and Duties re Adequacy of General Plan]

27 (CCP Section 1060; Government Code Sections 65300 et seq.)

28

8

1 49. Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates herein by reference each and every allegation

2 contained in paragraphs 1 through 48, inclusive, as though fully set forth herein.

3 50. Plaintiff alleges that a dispute and controversy has arisen between the parties

4 concerning the respective rights of the public and the duties of the Respondents, regarding the

5 legal adequacy of the City's 2011 General Plan and the currency of the FEIR for the 2011

6 General Plan, based upon the dramatic changes in the background environment and setting of the

7 City of Chico caused by the Paradise Camp Fire in 2018 and the subsequent recurring wildfires

8 and the COVID-19 pandemic since then, which have had a significant effect on the physical and

9 economic environment of the City of Chico..

10 51. Plaintiff contends that Respondent City's General Plan is legally inadequate and

11 outdated, as defined and based upon the California Supreme Court opinion in DeVita v. County

12 of Napa (1995) 9 Cal.4th 763, 38 Cal.Rptr. 699, 889 P.2d 1019, because of the substantial

13 physical and socio-economic changes caused by Climate Change (disruption) and the Camp Fire

14 and subsequent recurring wildfires and their effects on the physical environment and significant

15 changes in work location and practices, resulting in major reductions in automobile-oriented
16 transportation and on the existing assumptions, policies, and land use implications for the City's

17 General Plan.

18 52. Similarly, Plaintiff contends that the substantial changes in the background setting

19 and environment upon which the City's General Plan FEIR, certified in 2011, was based have
20 resulted in FEIR being "outdated," pursuant to the CEQA and the Government Code.

21 53.. Defendant City contends that its 2011 General Plan and FEIR are not legally

22 inadequate or outdated, respectively; and that the City has no duty to update or amend them,
23 accordingly.

24 54. These issues are timely raised prior to the filing of this action by Plaintiff and are

25 ripe for adjudication herein; this dispute and controversy involves issues of continuing

26 importance to the public interest with respect to public health and safety and environmental and

27 land use review by the parties and will continue to be contested by the Plaintiff and Defendants

28

9

T and other members of the public if this dispute is not heard, determined, and adjudicated by this

2 Honorable Court.

3 55. Further, Defendant City has begun the review of the Housing Element of its

4 General Plan, and will need the Court's review of these issues, in order to know how to proceed

5 with the update of the Housing Element and other mandatory elements which are directly related

6 to the review of the Housing Element and must be consistent with the Housing Element;

7 therefore, Plaintiff contends that it is in the public interest for this dispute and controversy to be

8 heard and decided by the Court

9 56. Wherefore, Plaintiff respectfully petitions the Court to hear, determine, and

10 adjudicate the rights and duties of the respective parties and to determine whether the City's

11 General Plan and General Plan FEIR are legally inadequate and outdated and need to be

12 comprehensively revised and updated and whether the City must also adopt an Environmentall

13 Justice Element with this update, pursuant to Government Code section 65302, subd. (h).

14
PRAYER
15 WHEREFORE, Petitioner and Plaintiff pray this Honorable Court to enter judgment for
16 Petitioner and against Respondents, as follows.
17 As to the First Cause of Action for Administrative Mandate:
18 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate or other appropriate writ, pursuant to Code of Civil 19

22

23 2. That Respondents prepare, circulate, and certify a legally adequate environmental

27 adequate City General Plan
3.) That the Court issue an administrative stay, pursuant to CCP section 1094.5(g), 28 during the pendency of this action, staying further action by Respondents to approve, grant,

10

1 and/or issue any application for a grading, excavation, and/or building permit or to approve 01

2 issue any other permits or entitlements in the furtherance of the proposed Project which is the

3 subject of this action, unless and until the Court has heard and finally adjudicated this action.

4 As to the Second Cause of Action for Declaratory Relief Cause re the 2011 City General

5 Plan and 2011 General Plan FEIR

6 1. That the Court hear, determine, and adjudicate the rights and duties of the respective

7 parties and determine whether the City's 2011 General Plan and the 2011 General Plan FEIR are

8 legally inadequate or outdated and whether the City has a mandatory duty, pursuant to State

9 statutory and/or common law to comprehensively update the City General Plan, including the

10 adoption of an Environmental Justice Element, pursuant to Government Code section 65301.

11 subd. (h).

12 As to All Causes of Action Herein:

13 1. For costs of suit incurred herein;
