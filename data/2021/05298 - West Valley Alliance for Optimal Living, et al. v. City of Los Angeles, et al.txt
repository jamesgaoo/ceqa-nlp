3 Writ of Mandate ("Petition"), as follows:

INTRODUCTION

1. Petitioner challenges the adoption by Respondent City of Los Angeles ("City" or
"Respondent") of the Supplemental Environmental Impact Report ("SEIR") and Erratum, and
7 the related discrctionary approvals (together, the "Project Approvals") for the proposed
8 development known as the "Promenade 2035 Project" located at 6100 N. Topanga Canyon
9 Boulevard; 21800 and 21900 W. Erwin Street; 21801, 21821, 21901, and 29131 W. Oxnard
10| Street; and 6101 N. Owensmouth Avenue, Woodland Hills, CA 91367 (the "Project"). As noted

18 with construction. The City Planning Commission for the City of Los Angeles certified the
19 Supplemental Environmental Impact Report and Erratum for the Project on May 28, 2020. The
20 Advisory Agency also approved a variety of discretionary permits for the Project. Petitioner
21 requests that the Court vacate the Project Approvals because Respondent failed to comply with
22 the provisions set forth under the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code
23 section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA"), and therefore failed to proceed a in a manner required by law.
24 3. Petitioner seeks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under California Code of Civil
25 Procedure section 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate, rescind and set aside all Project
26 Approvals and the environmental determination because Respondent failed to comply with

17 the Los Angeles City Council pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21151(c). Petitioner
18 Jeff Bornstein's CEQA appeal remains pending.
19 CEOA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REOUIREMENTS

20 22. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public
21 agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental
22 implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the
23 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
24 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires
25 governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects
26 of projects, and to seek feasible means reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that to

27

7 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with
2 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
3 23. CEQA is California's broadest environmental law and helps to guide public
4 | agencies such as the City during issuance of permits and approval of projects. Courts have
5 interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest protection of the environment within the reasonable scope
6 of the statutes. CEQA applies to all discretionary projects proposed to be conducted or approved
7 by City, including private projects requiring discretionary government approval. See California
8 Public Resources Code, sections 21000 - 21178, and Title 14 Cal. Code Regs., section 753, and
9 Chapter 3, sections 15000 - 15387.

10 24. A strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an Environmental

0949 elINS "PAE BJJYSIM E8€8 11 Impact Report ("EIR") is built into CEQA which is reflected in what is known as the "fair
12 argument" standard, under which an agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence
Channel Law Group, LLZ06 13 8 in the record supports a fair argument that project may have a significant effect on the
'SIlH Áueseg 14 environment. No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75, 82; Friends of "B" St.
15 v. City of Haywood (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988, 1002.
16 25. "The EIR is the primary means of achieving the Legislature's considered
17 declaration that it is the policy of this state to 'take all action necessary to protect, rehabilitate,
18 and enhance the environmental quality of the state.' [Citation. ] The EIR is therefore "the heart of
19 CEQA.' [Citations.] An EIR is an 'environmental "alarm bell" whose purpose it is to alert the
20 public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached ecological
21 points of no return." Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California
22 (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.
23 26. Under CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, if a project is not exempt and may cause

24 a significant effect on the environment, the agency must prepare an EIR. PRC §§ 21100, 21151;
25 14 Cal. Code Regs. §15064(a)(1), (f)(1). "Significant effect upon the environment" is defined as
26 "a substantial or potentially substantial adverse change in the environment." PRC §21068; 14 Cal

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 8

(VIOLATION OF CEQA)
10 27. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
11 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein. 8 d77 'dnoJg ME7 jeuueud 12 28. The City violated the California Environmental Quality Act in the following LLZ06
§ BUNS "PALE EJlYSIM E3E8 13 respects: (A) The City's process was confusing, failed to comply with CEQA, and deprived the
'SILH AueAeg 14 public of the opportunity to review and comment on the Modified Project and the environmental
15 documentation for the Modified Project, (B) The City prejudicially abused its discretion by
16 failing to provide an accurate, stable, and finite project description, (C) The SFEIR included
17 improper deferral of mitigation, (D) The CEQA analysis improperly relied on project design
18 features, (E) The SEIR failed to address health impacts associated with Covid-19 and
19 development of the sports/entertainment facility, (F) The SEIR failed to comply with Sierra Club
20 V. County of Fresno, (G) The City failed to modify and recirculate the SEIR for the project, (H)
21 The City inappropriately rejected the Environmentally Superior Alternative (Alternative 4), and
22 (I) The Mitigation Monitoring Plan failed to include all required mitigations.
23 29. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion
24 by failing to comply with the procedures outlined in the CEQA Guidelines and failing to
25 conduct adequate environmental review for the Project. Accordingly, Respondent's SEIR and
26 Erratum must be set aside.
