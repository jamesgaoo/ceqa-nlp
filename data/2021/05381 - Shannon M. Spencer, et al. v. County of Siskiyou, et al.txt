Writ, of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief ("Petition") stating, claims
against Respondents and Defendants the County of Siskiyou ("County") and County of Siskiyou

INTRODUCTION
t
This action challenges the Board's adoption of two related ordinances on August. 3, -f1M... - (*. OAMD/ O :

i 2021; Ordinance 21-13 (the "Groundwater Ordinance") and Ordinance 21-14 (the "Water Truck
Ordinance) (collectively, the "Ordinances"), on the ground that the Board's action violated the
California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"). .: *1
10 2. Within the County many properties used for residential and agricultural purposes lack a
11 reliable, on-site source of water because they do not have groundwater wells. As a result, many
12 residents and businesses are forced to purchase water and have it delivered to them. Historically, this 4

1 13 has often been accomplished by purchasing groundwater from a well owner and then arranging for it •4
14| to be delivered with a water truck. The Ordinances will make this practice unlawful by prohibiting the fein'üR TM::. 11:..-

•: 15 off-site use of groundwater and the use of water trucks on certain roads, unless appropriate permits are 3:1 11 4.10 O

:91 721n 16 first obtained from the County, However, due to the requirements for issuing the necessary permits, CA : Nore. .:.: 3eM9leatd:BC
17 many people will be unable to obtain them. As a result, many people will be compelled to go without

18 a reliable water supply, to cease or modify their land uses, or to develop new means of obtaining water
19 that circumvent the Ordinances. Each of these scenarios carries a reasonable possibility of a causing
20 significant environmental impacts. However, Respondents determined that the Ordinances were

21 exempt from CBQA and declined to performn any environmental review.

22 3. In so doing, Respondents (1) improperly piecemealed environmental review by failing

23 to consider the cumulative impacts of both Ordinances in determining whether an exemption applied;
24 (2) erroneously determined that the "common sense" exemption applied by refusing to account for the
25 Ordinances' indirect effects; (3) failed to identify substantial evidence to support the use of categorical
26 exemptions for environmental protection regulations; and (4) erroneously determined that there was no
27| reasonable possibility of significant environmental impacts due to unusual circumstances.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

4. Petitioners thus seek (1) a writ of mandate pursuant to §§ 21080 and 21080.5 of the

2 Public Resources Code and §§ 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure directing Respondents

3 to set aside their.approval of the Ordinances and to comply with CEQA prior to any subsequent
approval; (2) a declaratory judgment pursuant to 1060 of the Code of Civil Procedure that
Respondents' adoption of the Ordinances violated CEQA; and (3) injunctive relief pursuant to §§ 525
and 526 of the Code of Civil Procedure to obtain compliance with CEQA.

PARTIES

5. Petitioner, Shannon M. Spencer is co-trustee of the Ellison Family Trust, along with Eli

10 J. Walters, which is the legal owner of a ranch located in the County of Siskiyou known as "Ellison

11 Ranch." Petitioners Sherri K. Ellison, Seth S. Walters, and Garrett A. Walters all reside and/or work
12 on the Ellison Ranch properties. Ellison Ranch is a small, family owned business in Montague,

13 California, located off of Highway A12. Currently, Ellison Ranch runs 220 head of cattle and grows

14 grass hay, alfalfa hay, and grain hay, which it uses to feed its own cattle and sell to other cattle *
15 ranchers in the area. However, due to increasing costs and decreasing cattle prices in recent years,
16 Ellison Ranch has been forced to look for new sources of revenue, including selling surplus
17. groundwater from its groundwater wells. In 2020 Ellison Ranch suffered a net loss of $60,000 on its ::
18 cattle business while earning $70,000 in revenue from its groundwater sales. If Ellison Ranch is
19 unable to continue selling groundwater, the long-term vitality of its business will be severely
20 compromised.

21 6.. Respondent County of Siskiyou is, and at all times herein mentioned was, a political
22 subdivision of the State of California organized and existing under Government Code § 23000 et seq.

23 The County's administrative headquarters is located in the County of Siskiyou. The County is the
24| "lead agency" for purposes of CEQA and is therefore obligated to conduct any environmental review
25 required in connection with the Ordinances' adoption.

26 7. Respondent County of Siskiyou Board of Supervisors is, and at all times herein

27 mentioned was, the duly elected decision-making body of Respondent County of Siskiyou. As the
28 decision-making body, the Board was charged with responsibilities under CEQA, including ensuring

| (8801/002/01312965.DOCX) 3
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

compliance with CEQA prior to the Ordinances' adoption. The Board's administrative headquarters is
2 located in the County of Siskiyou.

3 8. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents fictitiously

4 named Does through 100 and sues such respondents by fictitious names. Petitioners are informed

5 and believe, and on that basis alleges, that the fictitiously named respondents are also responsible for
6 the actions described in this Petition. When the truc identities and capacities of these Respondents
7 have been determined, Petitioners will amend this petition, with leave of the court if necessary, to

8 insert such identities and capacities.

10 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

11 18. On May 4, 2021, the Board held a public hearing regarding the proposed adoption of
12 two urgency ordinances, Urgency Ordinance 2021-07 and Urgency Ordinance 2021-08, which were
13 identical to the Groundwater Ordinance and the Water Truck Ordinance, respectively, except for 3.
14 certain modifications not pertinent to this lawsuit (collectively, the "Urgency Ordinances"). The Tr: SSL
15 Board also held first readings for the Groundwater Ordinance and the Water Truck Ordinance. During :F.

3 16 the public hearings, discussion surrounded illegal cannabis grows, not environmental or natural •:S.I. :
17 resource protection. After the close of the public hearing, the Board approved the Urgency :o• 3 •404:.
18 Ordinances and they went into effect immediately.

19 A. The Groundwater Ordinance

20 19. The Groundwater Ordinance amended Title 3, Chapter 13 of the Siskiyou County Code
21 ("SCC") by adding Article 3.5, and made it unlawful to extract groundwater for the purposé of using

22 or selling it on any land other than the land from which it was extracted, or to use groundwater so
23 extracted, without first obtaining an administrative permit.

24 20. A permit may be obtained by filing an application with the Siskiyou County
25 Community Development Department, Environmental Health Division ("Division"). The Division
26 reviews the application with affected County departments, receives any comments such departments
27 may have, then submits the application and any comments to the Community Development Director
28 ///

{8801/002/01312965.DOCX} S
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

("Director"). The Director is authorized to require an inspection of any or all parcels associated with

2 the application.

3 21. The permit as characterized as being "ministerial." However, the ordinance does not
set forth objective criteria that, if satisfied, obligate the Director to issue the permit. Instead, it
identifies only disqualifying criteria. It states that "in order to grant the ministerial, administrative
6  permit, the purpose and use of groundwater shall be incidental to a lawful activity." Additionally,
7 "[e]xtracted groundwater shall only be for uses and activities allowed by the underlying zoning
8 designation of the parcel(s) receiving the extracted groundwater or uses that have received Conditional
Use Permit approval or are legal non-conforming uses. Thus, anyone using off-site groundwater for
10 an activity not permitted by the zoning code, such as domestic uses by. a person residing in an
11 agricultural zone, or for an allegedly unlawful activity, such as commercial cannabis cultivation, will
12 be unable to obtain a permit.
.
13 22. Moreover, because such persons are obviously disqualified from receiving a permit,|
14 they are unlikely even to submit an application. 2 ;
15 23. The ordinance also provides that the Director "may withhold processing of and/or 1ES
16| issuance of an administrative permit, where a Notice to Appear, Civil Action, Notice to Comply,
17 Administrative Citation, and/or a Notice and Order to Abate has been issued and/or is pending +: 31:
18 administrative or judicial review on any of the associated parcels requesting an administrative permit,
19  until the subject property or properties are found to be in complete compliance with any and all

20 applicable County Code sections." Thus, the Director is authorized to withhold permits from any
21 person who has been accused of using property in violation of the SCC, and any person proposing to
22 extract groundwater for the use of such person, until all alleged violations have been completely
23| resolved.

24 24. If granted, the permit is valid for one year. It may be renewed for subsequent one-year
25| terms "subject to the same criteria" for permit issuance.

26 25. A $5,000 penalty is imposed for violations, and each instance in which groundwater is
27 extracted and transported off the parcel from which it was extracted without the required permit is
28 deemed a separate violation.

{8801/002/01312965.DOCX} 0
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

26. The Board found that the Groundwater Ordinance was exempt from CEQA because "it

2 can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility of a significant effect on the environment from
3 the adoption of this Ordinance establishing an administrative permit process for groundwater
4 extraction for use off-parcel, as the Ordinance does not itself prohibit or authorize groundwater

5 extraction for any particular parcel or project."

6 27. The Board also found that its adoption of the Groundwater Ordinance was categorically
7 | exempt from CEQA pursuant to the Class 7 Categorical Exemption, 14 C.C.R. coa 15307 (actions to

8 protect natural resources) and the Class 8 Categorical Exemption, 14 C.C.R. 400 15308 (actions to

9 protect the environment).

10 B.. The Water Truck Ordinance

11 28. The Water Truck Ordinance amended Title 3, Chapter 4 of the SCC by adding Article
12 15, and prohibited "Water Trucks" from traveling over any streets and highways (as defined in the
13| Vehicle Code) as may be specified by a resolution of the Board.

14 29. "Water Trucks" are defined as any of the following: (1) "a vehicle designed or being

15 used to carry water of not less than 100 gallons;" (2) "any vehicle designed for carrying or towing
16 tanks or bladders of 100 gallons of water or more;" or (3) a "vehicle designed to carry not less than
17 1,500 gallons of water and used primarily for transporting and delivering water to be applied by other
18 vehicles or pumping equipment at fire emergency scenes." "[V]ehicles, such as a cement truck or a
19 pesticide spray truck, that transport water as a mixture not suitable for irrigation" are excluded from
20 the definition.

21 30. The Division is authorized to grant a permit to operate a Water Truck that would

22 otherwise be in violation of Article 15. A permit may be granted "at [the Division's] discretion" so

23 long as "good cause exists," and if granted, is valid for the entire calendar year in which it is issued.

24 31. In deciding whether to issue a permit, the Division may require the applicant to disclose
25 "the source of the water, its specific destination, the routes to be used, the dates of delivery, and any
26 other information that will aid in enforcing this Article." The Division may also "require proof from
27| applicants that they possess any needed permits or licenses for the purported use for which water is

28 ///

18801/002/01312965.DOCX} 7
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

being delivered and investigate whether parcel to which water will be delivered may legally conduct
2 the activity for which the delivery is being made."

32. The prohibition "does not apply to [1] emergency vehicles, [2] government vehicles,
[3] vehicles of a contractor doing maintenance work and whose driver is in possession of [sic] valid
contract with a public entity a for such work, [4] a vehicle being driven by the holder of a timber harvest
plan, and [5] vehicles being driven by the holder of .. . . a document provided the driver of a vehicle
from a public entity evidencing a legal activity requiring the transport of water that the Board of
Supervisors has specified by resolution exempts the holder of from" Article 15's prohibition.
33. The ordinance also authorizes the Division to establish a process "whereby the holder
10 of a valid permit under this Article or [the Groundwater Ordinance] may submit for provisional

11 approval of an additional specific destination (e.g. address or APN) to which a water delivery may be

12 made using streets and highways otherwise restricted under [Article 15]." :

13 34.
. . •: Any violation, including "the unauthorized alteration of a permit issued [under the
14 Water Truck Ordinance] or [the Groundwater Ordinance] is. grounds for permit.revocation." 7 .11 1:. L.O
15 Additionally, any person whose permit is revoked "shall be ineligible for a permit under [the Water
*.
16 Truck Ordinance] or [the Groundwater Ordinance] for two years."
•.

17 35. Violators shall be guilty of an infraction or misdemeanor and shall be fined $100 or

18 such other amount as may be determined by the Board by resolution, subject to the limitations in
19 Vehicle Code § 21104.

20 36. The Board found that its adoption of the Water Truck Ordinance was exempt from
21 CEQA because "it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility of a significant effect on the

22 environment from the adoption of these regulations allowing for the restriction of Water Tender

23 Vehicles." The Board also found that the Water Truck Ordinance was categorically exempt from

24 review 7 pursuant to the Class 7 Categorical Exemption, 14 C.C.R. § 15307, and the Class 8 Categorical
25 Exemption, 14 C.C.R. § 15308.

C. The Board's Adoption of the Ordinances

2 37. On July 5, 2021, Petitioners submitted a detailed comment letter to the Board, asserting
3 that the Ordinances constituted an effective ban on the use of groundwater in certain areas of the
County; that the Ordinances constituted a "project" within the meaning of CEQA; that the Board's ; adomion or e Opdilaness was not exempt from CEQA under the common sense exemption, the
6 Class 7 categorical exemption, or the Class 8 categorical exemption; that the Ordinances, both
7 individually and collectively, have the potential to cause significant environmental impacts; and that
8 an environmental impact report was required to evaluate such potential impacts.

9 38. On July 6, 2021, the Board continued the public hearings for the Ordinances until its
10 August 3, 2021 meeting.

11 39. Prior to the August 3, 2021 meeting, County staff prepared a staff report that responded
12 to some of the claims Petitioners made in its July 5, 2021 letter (the "Staff Report"). The Staff Report
13 was prepared for the Groundwater Permit Ordinance, not the Water Truck Ordinance. The Staff
14 Report's subject line reads: "Groundwater Extraction for Use Off-Site Ordinance." In addition, the
15 various discussion sections describe "[t]he proposed Ordinance" as establishing a "ministerial
16| permitting process for extraction of groundwater for use off-site."

17 F 40. On August 2, 2021, Petitioners submitted a second comment letter to a the Board urging
18 the County to prepare an environmental impact report. The letter responded to the Staff Report and

19 reiterated that the Ordinances were not exempt from environmental review, either under the "common

20 sense" exemption or the Class 7 and 8 categorical exemptions, because the exemptions were
21 inapplicable on their face and because unusual circumstances prevented the use of an exemption in
22 any event. The letter also criticized the Staff Report's responses to Petitioners' arguments as
23 "incomplete," "evasive," and "conclusory."

24 41. On August 3, 2021, the Ordinances were given a second reading and adopted by the
25 Board. They became effective 30 days later, on September 2, 2021.

2 CAUSES OF ACTION

3 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

4 Writ of Mandate - COA Violation

5 (Failure to Conduct Environmental Review)

6 42. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs 1 through

7 41 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

8 43. CEQA applies to public agency decisions to carry out, authorize, or approve projects

9 that could have adverse effects on the environment. Where applicable, CEQA requires agencies to
10 inform themselves about the environmental effects of their proposed actions, carefully consider all

11 relevant information before committing to a proposed course of action, give the public an opportunity
12 to comment on environmental issues associated with the agency's action, and avoid or reduce
13 significant environmental impacts when feasible to do so.

14 44. To ensure compliance with CEQA, a public agency considering whether to carry out,
15 authorize, ol approve a discretionary project must first conduct a preliminary review to determine
16 whether CEQA applies. This entails evaluating whether the activity in question constitutes a "project"
17 under CEQA and, if so, whether any exemptions apply so as to excuse CEQA's environmental review
18 requirements. If the activity qualifies as a "project" and there are no applicable exemptions, then the

19 agency must prepare an initial study to determine whether CEQA's environmental review
20 requirements can be satisfied by the adoption of a negative declaration or whether preparation of an
21 environmental impact report is necessary.

22 45. In this case, Respondents violated CEQA by erroncously determining that the
23 Ordinances were exempt from environmental review requirements.

24 A. The Common Sense Exemption

25 46. Respondents adoption of the Ordinances was not exempt under the "common sense"
26 exemption set forth in 15061(b)(3) of the CEQA Guidelines.

27 47. Section 15061(b)(3) exempts a project from a CEQA review "[w]here it can be seen with
28 certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the

f880[/002/01312965.DOCX} 10
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

environment." However, this exemption is "reserved for those obviously exempt projects, where its
2 absolute and precise language clearly applies." (Davidson Homes V. City of San Jose (1997) 54
3 Cal.App.4th 106, 117 [internal quotations omitted].) As such, "the showing required of a party

4 challenging [the common sense exemption] is slight, since [the] exemption requires the agency to be

5 certain that there is no possibility the project may cause significant environmental impacts." (Id.) "If

6 legitimate questions can be raised about whether the project might have a significant impact . a the
agency cannot find with certainty that a project is exempt." (Id.) Moreover, it is the "agency's
8 obligation to produce substantial evidence supporting its exemption decision," particularly where
9 "opponents of the project have raised arguments regarding the possible significant environmental
10 impacts." (Id.)

11 48. In determining whether the common sense exemption applies, CEQA requires that

12 consideration be given to a project's reasonably foreseeable indirect impacts, including social or
13 economic impacts, if such impacts may cause a significant physical change to the environment. (See
14 CEQA Guidelines §§ 15358, 15064(d) (e); see also County Sanitation District No. 2 V. County of
15 Kern (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1544 [EIR required for ordinance redistricting disposal of sewage sludge
16 because of indirect impacts, including need for alternate disposal, increased hauling, and possible loss
17| of farmland in reaction to the new restrictions].)

18 49. In this case, Respondents failed to produce substantial evidence to show with
19 "certain[ty/ that there is no possibility" that the Ordinances' reasonably foreseeable indirect impacts
20 will cause a significant physical change to the environment. (Davidson, supra, 54 Cal.App.4th at

21 117.).

22 50. According to the Staff Report, the common sense exemption is applicable because the
23 Groundwater Ordinance "merely creates a regulatory process, and it is anticipated that groundwater
24| extractors and water haulers in the County will seek to comply with the permitting requirements as
25 evidenced by the permits already issued." In other words, Respondents' maintain that "it can be seen
26 with certainty that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on
27 the environment," (CEQA Guidelines § 15061(b)(3),) because (1) the creation of a "regulatory

28 ///

|l (8801/002/01312965.DOCX} 11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

process" does not create any potential for significant environmental impacts, and (2) any potential
2 environmental impacts could be avoided by affected persons simply obtaining the required permits.

3 51. Respondents are incorrect. The creation of a "regulatory process" can, and often does,
4 cause significant environmental impacts that could be mitigated or avoided by conducting appropriate
5 environmental review prior to approval. (See Dunn-Edwards Corporation V. Bay Area Air Quality
6 Management District (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 644 [holding categorical exemption inapplicable because

7 regulations could result in an increase of VOC emissions]; Wildlife Alive V. Chickering (1976) 18

8 Cal.3d 190 [holding categorical exemption inapplicable to regulations fixing hunting dates because
regulations had "the potential for a significant environmental impact, both favorable and
10 unfavorable"].)

11 52. Additionally, it is not the case that all potential environmental impacts could be avoided
12 by affected persons simply obtaining the required permits. The County's reasoning ignores the fact
13 that not all affected persons will be able to acquire the necessary permits. To obtain a permit under the
14 Groundwater Ordinance applicants must demonstrate that the ultimate use of the water will be for a
15 lawful purpose and consistent with applicable zoning classifications. Thus, if a person cannot make
16 this showing, they will be unable to acquire a permit. Similarly, a permit can be withheld if any
17 property associated with the application is not in full compliance with the SCC until full compliance is
18 achieved. Individuals unable to obtain the required permits will be forced to pursue other options to

19 obtain water, to cease ot modify their land uses, or to develop means of circumventing the Ordinances'

20 requirements, and there is a reasonable possibility that such activities will result in a significant impact

21 on the environment.

22 53. For instance, persons engaged in commercial cannabis cultivation, or the delivery of
23 || water to such persons, will be unable to obtain a permit under either of the Ordinances. For members

24 of this class, the Ordinances are an effective ban on the use of groundwater, and they will be forced to
25 decide whether to cease their current land use or to pursue alternative means of acquiring water.
26 Similarly, persons residing in areas that are not zoned for residential use, or in structures that are not
27 legally permitted developments, will be unable to acquire a permit under the Ordinances. These
28 /!/

{8801/002/01312965.DOCX} 12
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

individuals will likewise be forced to decide whether to cease their current land use or to pursue
2 alternative means of acquiring water.

54. That members of these groups may be engaging in activities that are unlawful or

V' inconsistent with applicable zoning codes is immaterial to whether the Ordinances' may cause
n potential environmental impacts. Any unlawful. activity occurring at the time of project approval is

6 part of the environmental baseline against which project's potential environmental impacts must be
measured. (See Banning Ranch Conservancy V. City of Newport Beach (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1209,
Co 1233 [holding that CEQA required analysis of impacts to existing conditions, even if existing
9 conditions may have been altered by illegal activity]; Riverwatch v. County of San Diego (1999) 76
10 Cal.App.4th 1428, 1451 ["[E]nvironmental impacts should be examined in light of the environment as

11 it exists when a project is approved. . .. [P]rior illegal activities cannot be entirely ignored."]; see also
12| Fat v. County of Sacramento (2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 1270, 1277 [upholding agency's decision to
13 analyze impacts relative to baseline that accounted for unauthorized operation of private airportj.)
14 55.
1 The record contains substantial evidence of the existence of these two groups in the
15 County. As to cannabis cultivators, the Agenda Worksheet for the Water Truck Ordinance references
16 the "large scale growth of illegal cannabis cultivation in certain areas of the County." Similarly, the (
17 Agenda Worksheet for the Groundwater Permit Ordinance notes that "[s]taff has received complaints :33
18 about groundwater being . P p*. delivered to Illegal Cannabis Cultivation sites." Additionally, the Staff
19 Report notes that "within the last several years the County has seen farmland and agricultural
20 operations be converted [and] .. . used for illegal cannabis cultivations."
21 56; Public comments at the Board's August 3, 2021 meeting also demonstrate the scale of
22 cannabis cultivation in the County, One commenter stated in support of the Ordinances that there is an

23 ongoing "crisis with illegal marijuana grows" in the County. Another supporter mentioned that he had
24 observed "more water trucks and more grows in the northern area of the County" than he had
25 previously. Another decried the "exponential growth" of cannabis cultivation in recent years.
26 57. As to persons residing in areas not zoned for residential use or not residing in legally
27 permitted developments, the County acknowledges the existence of this group in the Staff Report,
28 noting that public services "are being provided to areas that do not have legally established

(8801/002/01312965 DOCX} 13
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

developments." Indeed, the Staff Report confirms that at least one licensed "water hauler operator
2 currently provides potable water deliveries to approximately four county customers." Significantly,
3 the County did not attempt any investigation into the prevalence of unlicensed water delivery
4 operations, even though comments at the public hearing indicated that such operations are widespread.

5 58. Public comments at the August 3, 2021 meeting also show that a significant number of a

6 people are living in areas not zoned for residential use or otherwise not residing in legally permitted

7 developments. One supporter decried the off-site delivery of groundwater to the Shasta Vista and Big
8 Springs areas, claiming that such water "belongs to people who build a septic system instead of split
trenches" and asserting that if such people want water they should "build a house with a well like

10 normal people." Another woman supportive of the Ordinances encouraged the Board to stay the
11 course, noting that her family built "a house, septic, and a well" and that her parents "went through

12 all the correct procedures" and that new laws were need to make sure that people "follow the rules."
13 The woman also observed that "more and more water trucks are now on [] County roads" after a
14 recent wildfire. An opponent noted that the Ordinances have a disproportionate impact on Asians in
15 the community, particularly Hmongs. Another opponent asserted that denying the County's Asian

* 16 community of their right to access water for essential human needs constituted cruel and unusual
17 punishment. That commenter also criticized the County for seizing Water Trucks and preventing
18 members of her community from using Water Trucks after a recent wildfire pursuant to the Urgency
19 Ordinances.

20 59. As shown below, Petitioners raised fair arguments about the physical changes to the
21 | environment that may result if individuals in these groups are unable to obtain water as a result of the

22 Ordinances. However, the County refused to give any meaningful consideration to these indirect
23 effects. Instead, the County dismissed any activity not in accordance with state and local laws as

24 irrelevant and then assumed that any potentially signiciant indirect effects could be avoided by simply
25 obtaining a permit.

26 60. Wildfires. In response to Petitioners' claim that the Ordinances could cause an
27 increased risk of wildfires as a result of some people lacking water to extinguish an emerging fire or
28 being unable to water landscaping, thereby increasing the risk of ignition, County staff responded that

{8801/002/01312965.DOCX} 14
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 "[d]evelopment in accordance with local and state law would allow for the ability to water

2 landscaping" and that "development is reviewed by CalFire to ensure compliance with fire safe

3 regulations." No consideration was given to whether significant environmental impacts could result
4 from the activities of persons unable to acquire the necessary permits. There is substantial evidence
5 showing that some individuals in the County reside in areas not zoned for residential use and in
6 structures that are not legally-permitted dwellings. There is also substantial evidence of widespread
7 commercial cannabis cultivation. These people, and the people delivering water to them, will be

8 unable to demonstrate a lawful end use for the water and will therefore be unable to obtain permits

9 under the Ordinances. As a result, these groups may lack water for irrigation, landscaping, or
10 emergency purposes, such as fire prevention. This could increase the likelihood of a fire, or reduce
11 emergency response capabilities, thereby causing a significant physical change to the environment.
12 However, the County refused to consider these potentially significant impacts. Consequently,
13 Respondents cannot say with "certain[ty] that there is no possibility" that the Ordinances reasonably
14 foresecable indirect impacts may cause a significant physical change to the environment. (Davidson,
15 supra, 54 Cal.App.4th at 117.)

16 61. Transportation. In response to Petitioners' claim that the Ordinances could increase
17 a vehicle miles traveled as a result of the need to reduce delivery quantities to avoid being subject to the
18 Water Truck Ordinance, thereby increasing the frequency of deliveries, County staff responded that

19 "[i]t is unclear as to why individuals would avoid the permitting process in-lieu of 'personally
20 travel[ing] farther and more often to obtain water, or to hire more frequent, smaller truck deliveries.:
21| According to County staff, "the comment letter states that thousands of individuals currently receive

22 water deliveries but does not provide any evidence or expert opinion as to why this Ordinance is likely
23 to result in an increase in transportation other than the implied belief that individuals would avoid the
24 permitting process for more frequent deliveries." Again, by refusing to acknowledge that a significant
25 number of individuals will be unable to obtain the necessary permits, the County ignored potentially
26 significant environmental impacts that should have been analyzed. There is substantial evidence

27 showing that individuals residing in areas not zoned for residential use, or in structures that are not
28 legally-permitted dwellings, and commercial cannabis cultivators, will be unable to obtain permits

{8801/002/01312965.DOCX} 15
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

under the Ordinances. a As a result, both groups may require more frequent water deliveries in smaller

2 quantities to maintain their current land uses, thereby causing a significant physical change to the

3 environment. However, the County refused to consider these potentially significant impacts.

4 Additionally, in responding to Petitioners' concerns regarding transportation impacts, the Staff Report
5 suggests that affected persons could receive "delivered water from other jurisdictions" because "the

6 proposed Ordinance does not apply" in those circumstances. This practice would obviously increase

7 vehicle miles travelled relative to existing conditions, yet remarkably the County makes the claim in

8 support of its conclusion that there are no potentially significant impacts to transportation.
9 Consequently, Respondents cannot say with "certain/ty] that there is no possibility" that the
10 Ordinances reasonably foreseeable indirect impacts may cause a significant physical change to the
11 environment. (Davidson, supra, 54 Cal.App.4th at 117 [emphasis added].)

12 62. Housing and Public Services. Petitioners observed that the Ordinances could force
13 affected communities to relocate to areas with a more reliable water supply, which could induce
14 unplanned population growth and strain public service resources in those areas. County staff
15 responded that "development of property in Siskiyou County already requires a property owner to
16 either install on-site well and septic systems or connect to municipal/[community service district]
17 services" and that "[a]ll proposed development is reviewed by public service providers and includes
18 development fees to ensure these public services can. be adequately provided." Despite
19 acknowledging the existence in the County of "areas that do not have legally established
20  developments," staff declined to give any consideration to the potential environmental impacts
21 resulting from the inability of people in such areas to obtain permits that would allow off-site
22 groundwater use. Here again, Respondents refuse to acknowledge that a significant number of
23| individuals will be unable to obtain the necessary permits. There is substantial evidence showing that
24 individuals residing in areas not zoned for residential use, or in structures that are not legally-permitted
25 dwellings, will be unable to obtain permits under the Ordinances. To avoid violating the Ordinances,
26 these groups may be forced to seek new housing options, which could lead to new development in
27 | other areas, increased non-permitted dwelling structures in areas with access to surface water, and an
28 increased demand for public services wherever such people relocate. However, the County refused to

{8801/002/01312965.DOCX} 16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 consider these potentially significant impacts. Consequently, Respondents cannot say with
2 "certain[ty] that there is no possibility" that the Ordinances reasonably foresceable indirect impacts

3 may cause a significant physical change to the environment. (Davidson, supra, 54 Cal.App.4th at 117
4 [emphasis added].)

5 63. Geology and Soils. Petitioners observed that effectively prohibiting a significant

6 number of people from using groundwater for irrigation and landscaping purposes could result in dried
7 and depleted soil in affected areas, thereby reducing soil efficiency in future years. County staff

8 responded that this "appear[ed] to be unsubstantiated opinion" because County records show that
9 permitted and properly zoned agricultural operations commonly construct on-site wells or are provided

I0 water from irrigation districts. The County also observed that "an operator's sole reliance on water
11 deliveries would be a costly business practice and is not a common occurrence of legitimate
12 agricultural operations in Siskiyou County." The record is clear that the Ordinances were proposed
13 |l and enacted to prevent the use of groundwater for allegedly unlawful purposes--in particular,
14 commercial cannabis cultivation--and that under the Ordinances, cannabis cultivators, and others not

15 in compliance with zoning requirements or municipal code provisions, will be unable to obtain the
16 necessary permits or to use groundwater as they previously had. If cannabis cultivators are no longer

17 able to water their crops, those crops may fail due to lack of irrigation, thereby reducing soil efficiency

18 in future years. The environment does not care whether these activities are "legitimate" or not, and
19 neither should the County for purposes of CEQA. (See Banning Ranch, supra, 211 Cal.App.4th at
20 1233; Riverwatch, supra, 76 Cal.App.4th at 1451; see also Fat, supra, 97 Cal.App.4th at 1277.)
21 Nevertheless, the County refused to consider the potentially significant environmental impacts

22 associated with eliminating such uses. Consequently, Respondents cannot say with "certain[ty/ that
23 there is no possibility" that the Ordinances reasonably foreseeable indirect impacts may cause a
24 significant physical change to the environment. (Davidson, supra, 54 Cal.App.4th at 117 [emphasis
25 added].)

26 64. Hydrology and Water Quality. Petitioners also observed that effectively banning

27 groundwater use in certain areas could cause localized impacts to groundwater recharge, and that the
28 potential impacts to soil could alter drainage patterns in affected areas. County staff responded that

{8801/002/01312965.DOCX} 17
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

the County "is actively permitting well owners under the existing urgency ordinance, and thus the
2| ordinance permitting process clearly does not ban use of groundwater off-site." The record is clear
3 that the Ordinances were proposed and enacted to prevent the use of groundwater for allegedly

4 unlawful purposes and that such uses are prevalent in the County, Nevertheless, the Staff Report

5 dismisses any potential for environmental impacts on the ground that the County is actively issuing
6 permits under the Urgency Ordinances. However, that is irrelevant. The Ordinances, and the Urgency
7 Ordinances, have broad application and therefore it is no surprise that some people have applied for
g and received the necessary permits. But this does not mean that everyone will be able to obtäin a
permit or that no environmental impacts are possible.. Petitioners' concern is that environmental
10 impacts may result from the activities of individuals unable to obtain permits under the Ordinances,

11 not those who obviously qualify.

12 65. The Staff Report. also attempts to dismiss the potential for significant impacts to
13 groundwater recharge by asserting that "in Siskiyou County the vast majority of illegal .cannabis
14 cultivation is not cultivated in the ground but rather cannabis plants are grown in bags, totes, or some

15 other form of moveable container." According to the Staff Report, "these growing conditions do not .1
16 allow for water to go into the ground and back into the aquifer." However, the Staff Report cites no
17| evidence for its claim that "the vast majority of illegal cannabis cultivation is not cultivated in the
18 ground." The County could easily have marshalled evidence to .support this assertion by consulting

19 with code enforcement or police department officials, or by conducting a review of those departments'
20 records. Indeed, the County did exactly this to support claims made regarding impacts to geology and

21 soils and the limited used of water haulers for potable water delivery. Yet no factual investigation was

22 performed in this instance. The County's failure to support its claims regarding cannabis cultivation is
23 particularly problematic given that during the public hearing for the Ordinances members of the public
24 | described cannabis cultivation in a manner consistent with traditional agricultural crops, not the
25 growing conditions described by the County. Moreover, even if the Staff Report's claim were true, it
26 nevertheless confirms that some cannabis cultivation sites do operate in a similar fashion to traditional
27 agricultural operations, which lends additional support to Petitioners' claims. Consequently,
28| Respondents cannot say with "certain|ty] that there is no possibility" that the Ordinances reasonably

(8801/002/01312965.DOCX} 18
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

foresecable indirect impacts may cause a significant physical change to the environment. (Davidson,

2 supra, 54 Cal.App.4th at 117 [emphasis added].)

3 66. Agricultural and Forestry Resources. Petitioners observed that preventing the
delivery and use of groundwater in certain neighborhoods, which depend entirely on groundwater
purchased from off-site private wells, may cause land suitable for agricultural use to be converted to
non-agricultural use, as crops fail and the land becomes unusable for agricultural purposes. County
staff responded: "The conversion of agricultural land to a non-agricultural use could only be
8 accomplished by obtaining Zone Change Application approval to change an agricultural zoning
9 district to a non-agricultural zoning district. There is no evidence to support the inference that
10 individual property owners would change the underlying zoning district of their property to a non-

11 agricultural zoning district rather than comply with the proposed Ordinance's ministerial permitting
12 procedures. .." As an initial matter, the County's response is entirely beside the point, as it does not
13 address the issue raised by Petitioners' comment: the potential environmental impacts associated with

14 crop failure due to lack of irrigation. Additionally, the County's misplaced focus on potential changes

15 to zoning designations is puzzling given that later in the Staff Report staff flatly contradicts its own
16 analysis, stating: "It should be noted that within the last several years the County has seen farmland

17 and agricultural operations be converted into non-agricultural uses specifically used for illegal

18 cannabis cultivations, including the illegal conversion of Williamson Act properties." As the County
19 acknowledges here, the actual use a of a given parcel, as distinguished from its permitted use under
20 applicable zoning laws, can be converted by the activities of the person in possession. More

21 importantly, however, the County's response again refuses to acknowledge the obvious fact that the

22 Ordinances were proposed to prevent off-site groundwater use by certain groups, that such persons
23 will, by design, be unable to obtain permits under the Ordinances, and that there is a reasonable

24 possibility that the inability of such persons to obtain permits may cause significant impacts on the
25 environment. Consequently, Respondents cannot say with "certain|ty] that there is no possibility" that
26 the Ordinances reasonably foreseeable indirect impacts may cause a significant physical change to the
27 environment. (Davidson, supra, 54 Cal.App.4th at 117 [emphasis added].)

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

B. The Class 7 and 8 Categorical Exemptions

2 67. Categorical exemptions are set forth in the CEQA Guidelines and reflect a
3 determination by the Secretary of the Natural Resources Agency that "the environmental changes
4 typically associated with projects in [a particular] class are not significant effects within the meaning
of CEQA." (Berkley Hillside Preservation v. City of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1086, 1104.) Thus, if

6 a categorical exemption applies, no formal environmental evaluation is required under CEQA.
7 However, a categorical exemption "can be relied on only if a factual evaluation of the agency's
8 proposed activity reveals that it applies." (Muzzy Ranch Co. v. Colano County Airport Land Use
Commission (2007) 41 Cal.4th 372, 386.) Thus, an agency invoking a categorical exemption "has the
10 burden of demonstrating that substantial evidence supports its factual finding that the project fell
11 within the exemption." (Save Our Big Trees v. City of Santa Cruz (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 694, 710-
12 11.)

13 68. 8 The Class 8 Categorical Exemption exempts "actions taken by regulatory agencies, as
14 authorized by state or local ordinance, to assure the maintenance, restoration, enhancement, or

15 protection of the environment where the regulatory process involves procedures for protection of the
t 16 environment." (CEQA Guidelines § 15308 [emphasis added].) The Class 7 Categorical Exemption is
17 nearly identical, only narrower in scope. It exempts "actions taken by regulatory. agencies as
18 authorized by state law or local ordinance to assure the maintenance, restoration, or enhancement of
19 natural resource where the regulatory process involves procedures for protection of the environment."
20 (CEQA Guidelines § 15307 [emphasis added].)

21 69. In this case, Respondents violated CEQA by relying on the Class 7 and 8 exemptions

22 because there is nO substantial evidence to support the application of these exemptions to the
23 Ordinances. There is no evidence let alone substantial evidence-that the Ordinances were adopted

24 "to assure the maintenance, restoration, enhancement, or protection" of the environment or any natural

25 resource. (CEQA Guidelines §§ 15307, 15308 [emphasis added].) In addition, neither of the
26 Ordinances contain "procedures for the protection of the environment."

27 70. The Water Truck Ordinance. Respondents do not attempt to justify their reliance on
28 the Class 7 and 8 exemptions for the Water Truck Ordinance. The only place where the County

(8801/002/01312965.DOCX} 20
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

expressly addresses the exemptions' applicability is the Staff Report. However, the Staff Report
2 makes no argument in support of the exemptions' applicability to the Water Truck Ordinance. This is
3 not surprising, as there is no plausible basis for asserting that an ordinance prohibiting water trucks
from operating on certain roads was enacted to "assure" environmental or natural resource benefits.

L (CEQA Guidelines §§ 15307, 15308.) However, the County's silence on this point is signifiçant
6 because it is in effect an admission that there is no substantial evidence to support application of either 7 the Class 7 or Class 7 8 exemption to the Water Truck Ordinance. Additionally, there is no provision in
8 the Water Truck Ordinance that could be reasonably characterized as a "proçedure for the protection
9 of the environment," as required to apply the Class 7 and 8 categorical exemptions. (CEQA
10 Guidelines $§ 15307, 15308.) Accordingly, Respondents failed to meet their burden of demonstrating

li with substantial evidence that any categorical exemption applies to the Water Truck Ordinance. (See
12 Save Our Big Trees, supra, 241 Cal.App.4th at 710-11.)

13 71. The Groundwater Ordinance. Respondents attempted to justify their reliance on the
14 Class 7 and 8 exemptions for the Groundwater Ordinance. However, those attempts were inadequate.
15 The Staff Report claims that the Groundwater Ordinance is exempt under the Class 7 and 7 8 categorical N1
16 exemptions "because the proposed Ordinance, both in its intentions and as written, clearly meets the
17 definitions of the above identified categorical exemptions. 33 However, staff's bare assertion that
18| the Groundwater Ordinance "clearly meets" the applicable requirements does meet Respondents' C1
19| burden of showing substantial evidence in support of the exemptions' application.

20 72. Later in the Staff Report, the County, responding to Petitioners' claims, attempts to

21 a make a reasoned argument in favor of the Class 7 and-8 exemptions" applicability to the Groundwater

2.2 Ordinance:

23 The prohibition of an activity that evidence shows is associated with environmental problems
24 | such as the contamination of farmland, constitutes an action to assure protection of the environment.
25 It should be noted that within the last several years the County has seen farmland and agricultural
26 operations be converted into non-agricultural uses specifically used for illegal cannabis cultivations,
27| including the illegal conversion of Williamson Act properties. The proposed Ordinance would
28 establish a ministerial permitting process that would verify zoning consistency, and at times,

/ {8801/002/01312965.DOCX} 21
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Williamson Act consistency to ensure the protection and maintenance of the county's agricultural
2  lands and one of the county's most important natural [sic] resource.

3 73, The County's response fails to show substantial evidence supports its application of the

4 exemptions to the Groundwater Ordinance for at least two reasons. First, the County's reasoning is
5 flawed. The County attempts to connect the Groundwater Ordinance to environmental or natural

6 resource benefits by implying that the ordinance is "prohibition of an activity that evidence shows is
7 associated with environmental problems." However, the County never identifies any evidence
8 | showing that off-site groundwater use is "associated with environmental problems." While the County
9 does offer anecdotal evidence that some farmland has been repurposed for cannabis cultivation in

10 recent years, it nonetheless fails to explain how cannabis cultivation is "associated with environmental
11 problems" or how the prevention of such activity will lead to environmental or natural resource
12 benefits. Additionally, there is no provision in the Groundwater Ordinance that could be reasonably
13 characterized as a "procedure for the protection of the environment," as required to apply the Class 7
14 and 8 categorical exemptions. (CEQA Guidelines §§ 15307, 15308.)

15 74, Second, and perhaps more importantly, the County completely fails to address whether
16 there may be negative environmental impacts associated with preventing off-site groundwater use. As

17 shown in Section A, supra, and discussed in in Section C, infra, Petitioners raised legitimate concerns
18 about potentially significant adverse environmental impacts that may result from the County's
19 adoption of the Ordinances. However, rather than addressing Petitioners' concerns by identifying

20 substantial evidence showing no potentially significant impacts, the County instead hid behind its own

21 failure to gather evidence and justified the exemptions' application by dismissing Petitioners' concerns
22 as "speculative," "unsubstantiated opinion," and "without factual support." (See Dunn-Edwards,
23 supra, 9 Cal.App.4th at 657-58 [holding agency violated CEQA by applying Class 7 and 8
24 exemptions where staff "was unable to produce evidence of no adverse impact" in response to
25 plaintiffs' claims, and agency's rejection of potential significant impacts was "predicated on lack of
26 the very information which would be provided by an EIR"].)

27 75. The County's only other argument that the Ordinances qualify as environmental or
28 natural resource protection regulations under the Class 7 and 8 categorical exemptions is that the

18801/002/01312965.DOCX} 22
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- Groundwater Ordinance's "mistrial permitting process . . . would verify zoning consistency, and at
2 times, Williamson Act consistency to ensure the protection and maintenance of the county's
3 agricultural lands and one of the county's most important natural [sic] resource." However, nothing
4| in the Ordinances requires the County to verify Williamson Act consistency. Indeed, nothing in the

5 Ordinances references the Williamson Act or even protection of agricultural land. Plainly, the

6 County's attempt to draw a connection between the Ordinances and Williamson Act compliance is a

7 post hoc rationalization designed to manufacture a basis for applying the Class 7 and 8 categorical
8 exemptions. Yet the County's logic proves far too much. By the County's reasoning, any regulation

9 that requires compliance with state and local laws as a condition to the issuance of a permit would
10 qualify for the Class 7 and 8 categorical exemptions because the issuing entity could, conceivably,
11 deny the permit on the ground that the applicant was in violation of some environmental protection
12 law.

13 76. Accordingly, Respondents failed to meet their burden of demonstrating with substantial
14 evidence that any categorical exemption applies to the Groundwater Ordinance. (See Save Our Big
15 Trees, supra, 241 Cal.App.4th at 710-11.)

* 16 C. Reasonable Possibility of Significant Impacts Due to Unusual Cireumstances

17 77. Even assuming, arguendo, that there was substantial evidence to support adopting the
18 Ordinances on a categorical exemption-and there was not--Respondents nevertheless violated
19 CEQA by failing to conclude that the unusual circumstances exception applied.

20 78. Categorical exemptions are not absolute. Even if a project might otherwise be eligible

21 a for a categorical exemption, an exemption "shall not be used for an activity" where, inter alia, (1)
22| "there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due
23 | to unusual circumstances," or (2) "the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the

24 same place, over time is significant." (CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2(b)--(c); see Dunn-Edwards Corp.,

25 supra, 9 Cal.App.4th at 657; see also Save Our Big Trees, supra, 241 Cal.App.4th at 694.)

"The Williamson Act establishes a mechanism for saving agricultural land by allowing counties to create agricultural 28 preserves and then to enter into contracts with landowners within those preserves. (Gov.Code, § 51200 et seq.) A Williamson Act contract obligates the landowner to maintain the land as agricultural for 10 or more years, with resulting
tax benefits." (Friends of East Willits Valley v. County of Mendocino (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 191, 195.)

I/ {8801/002/01312965.DOCX} 23
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

.

79. A "reasonable possibility of significant effect on the environment due to unusual
2 circumstances" exists if there is substantial evidence of a fair argument that a significant impact on the
3 environment may occur. (CEQA Guidelines §15300.2(c); see Berkley Hillside, supra, 60 Cal.4th at
4| 1115.) Substantial evidence means "enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this
5 information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion, even though other conclusions
6 might also be reached." (CEQA Guidelines § 15384(a).) Additionally, "[w]hether a fair argument can
7 be made that the project may have a significant effect on the environment is to be determined by
8 examining the whole record before the lead agency." (Id.) On the other hand, "[a]rgument,
9 speculation, unsubstantiated opinion or narrative evidence which is clearly erroneous or inaccurate
10 does not constitute substantial evidence." (Id.)

11 80. "Unusual circumstances" exist in this case because the Ordinances are responding to
12 widespread activity involving the ,ff-site use of groundwater for allegedly unlawful or unpermitted
13 purposes, particularly commercial cannabis cultivation, in certain areas of the County. Because this
14 problem is, by the County's own admission, so widespread in certain areas, there is a reasonable

15 possibility that the abrupt elimination of all such activity may cause one or more significant, localized
16 environmental impacts. In this way, the Ordinances present a greater possibility of significant
17 environmental impacts than is normally the case for environmental protection regulations. (See

18 Citizens for Environmental Responsibility v. State ex rel. 14th Dist. Ag. Assn. (2015_ 242 Cal.App.4th
19 555, 576 [unusual circumstances exist when "the project has some feature that distinguishes it from
20| others in the exempt class"].)

21 81. The County claims in the Staff Report that "[t]he notion that a ministerial permitting
22 process that ultimately verifies zoning consistency would lead to significant environmental impacts is
23 unfounded and unsupported." This statement is clearly erroneous and inaccurate. Regardless of
24 whether the permitting process is ministerial or discretionary, and regardless of whether it verifies
25 zoning consistency or some other regulatory requirement, the Ordinances were proposed, designed,
26 and enacted to prevent the off-site use of groundwater for allegedly unlawful or unpermitted purposes.
27 It is reasonable to infer from this, and from the provisions in the Ordinances themselves, that the
28| Ordinances will, in fact, prevent the off-site use of groundwater for unlawful purposes in some cases

{8801/002/01312965.DOCX} 24
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

and, in others, force regulated parties to modify their land uses or to develop a means of obtaining

2 water that circumvents the Ordinances' prohibitions. And, as shown in Section A, supra, a fair
argument can be made to support the conclusion that these activities may cause potentially significant
impacts to transportation, housing and public services, geology and soils, hydrology and water quality,
agriculture and forestry, and wildfires, among other things.

6 82. As to cumulative impacts, the Staff Report states: "As demonstrated within this staff

7 report, the proposed Ordinance does not authorize any new land uses or changes [sic] existing allowed
8 land uses. Rather, the project establishes a permitting process to ensure land uses are consistent with
9 local and state regulations." Therefore, the Staff Report concludes, "there would be no cumulative

10 impacts that would result from the proposed Ordinance.3 This conclusion is clearly erroneous and
11 inaccurate. First, the Staff Report does not even purport to analyze the cumulative impacts of the
12 "project" (i.e., the Groundwater Ordinance and the Water Truck Ordinance), only those associated

* 13 with "the proposed Ordinance." Second, even if the analysis and conclusion was framed in terms of
14 both Ordinances, the County's justification is substantively flawed because it never addresses any
15 | potential impacts associated with the Water Truck Ordinance.

16 83. Accordingly, Respondents violated CEQA by relying 011 a categorical exemption to

17 approve the Ordinances without environmental review.

18 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

19 Writ of Mandate - CEQA Violation

20 (Improper Piecemealing)

21 84. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs 1 through
22 83 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

23 85. Respondents also violated CEQA by improperly piecemealing environmental review.
24 The Groundwater Ordinance and the Water Truck Ordinance are part of the .same "project" under
25 CEQA and therefore Respondents were required to consider the cumulative impacts of both
26 enactments in determining whether an exemption applied. However, Respondents did not do this.
27| Instead, Respondents considered only the potential impacts of each ordinance individually.
28 ///

/ {8801/002/01312965.DOCX} 25
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

86. The "requirements of CEQA cannot be avoided by piecemeal review which results
2 from chopping a large project into many little ones-each with a minimal potential impact on the
3 environment-which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences." (Envt'l Prot. Info. Ctr. v.
4| Dept, of Forestry & Fire Prot. (2008) 44 Cal.4th 459, 503; Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible
Growth, Inc. V. City of Sonora (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1223 [CEQA "cannot be avoided by
6 chopping up proposed projects into bite-sized pieces which, individually considered, might be found
7 to have no significant effect on the environment or to be only ministerial"].) CEQA thus "forbids

8 piecemeal review of the significant environmental impacts of a project." (Berkeley Keep Jets Over the
9 Bay Comm. V. Bd. of Port Comm'rs (2011) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1358 [internal quotations omitted].)
10 Rather, when a lead agency undertakes the environmental review process, the lead agency must review
11 and consider the "whole of [the ] action," (CEQA Guidelines, § 15378 [emphasis added]), and consider
12 "the effects, both individual and collective, of all activities involved in [the] project." (Pub. Resources
13 Code, § 21002.1(d) [emphasis added].) It is only through a complete and accurate "view of the project
14 [that] affected outsiders and public decision-makers [may] balance the proposal's benefit against its
15 environmental cost, consider mitigation measures, assess the advantage of terminating the proposal . .
16 and weigh other alternatives in the balance."(Berkeley Keep Jets, supra, 91 Cal.App.4th at 1358.)
17 87. The term "project" is to be given a "broad interpretation" to "maximize protection of
18 the environment.» (Tuolumne County, supra, 155 Cal.App.4th at 1223; see Azusa Land Reclamation
19 Co. V. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1189; Friends of the Sierra
20 Railroad v. Tuolumne Park & Recreation Dist. (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 643, 653.) Thus, two related
21 actions will be deemed a single "project" under CEQA if one action "practically presumes completion®
22 of another action." (Banning Ranch Conservancy V. City of Newport Beach (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th
23 1209, 1223; sce San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center v. County of Stanislaus (1994) 27
24 Cal.App.4th 713, 732 [EIR for residential development should have included sewer expansion that

25 was a "crucial element[ ]" of development].) On the other hand, two actions may properly undergo
26 separate environmental review "when the projects have different proponents, serve different purposes,
27 or can be implemented independently." (Banning Ranch, supra, 211 Cal.App.4th at 1223.)
28  ///

(8801/002/01312965.DOCX} 26
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

H 88. Here, the Ordinances are part of the same "project" under CEQA. Both enactments
2 "practically presume" that the other will be adopted, both are proposed by the County, both are

3 intended to address the off-site use of groundwater for allegedly unlawful or unpermitted purposes,
particularly illegal cannabis cultivation, and neither can be effectively implemented independently.

6 (Banning Ranch, supra, 211 Cal.App.4th at 1223.) This is evident from the materials in the record and
the provisions in the Ordinances themselves.

7 89.

8 The Agenda Worksheet prepared for the Groundwater Permit Ordinance at the Board's
August 3, 2021 meeting contained "Summary of Issue" that stated: "Staff has received complaints
9 about groundwater being extracted from local wells and then delivered to illegal Cannabis Cultivation
10 sites." No other purpose or need for the enactment was identified.

11 90. Similarly, the Agenda Worksheet prepared for the Water Truck Ordinance at the
12 Board's August 3, 2021 meeting contained a "Summary of Issue" that stated: "The cultivation of
13 cannabis has previously been determined to be a nuisance and a waste of ground water. The large

14 : ..

15 scale growth of illegal cannabis cultivation in certain areas of the County has been aided by the

: shipment of illegally extracted ground water over County roads." Again, no other purpose or need for
16 the enactment was identified. 1:".:':

17 91. : :

Additionally, the Ordinances are clearly designed to work in conjunction with each
18 other. The Water Truck Ordinance: (1) authorizes the Director to require disclosure of information

19 regarding the source and destination of water to be delivered and proof that any necessary permits
20 have been obtained; (2) authorizes the Director to investigate whether the end use of the delivered
21 water is a lawful one; (3) establishes-a process for permit holders under both Ordinances .to seek

22 approval for additional delivery destinations; (4) provides that the unauthorized alteration of a permit
23 | issued under either of the Ordinances is grounds for revocation; and (5) provides that revocation of a
24 permit acquired under either of the Ordinances renders the holder ineligible to acquire a new permit
25 for two years. The extent to which the two pieces of legislation are integrated demonstrates that each
26 "practically presumes completion" of the other. (Banning Ranch, supra, 211 Cal.App.4th at 1223.)
27 ///
28 ///

{880[/002/0131296S.DOCX} 27
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- 92. Moreover, County staff, the Board, and the public treated both Ordinances as part of a

2 single, overarching project. The hearings for the Ordinances were always on the same day, and when
3 the hearing on one was continued, the other was continued as well. In addition, Respondents relied on
4| the Staff Report for the Groundwater Permit Ordinance to support their exemption determination for

5 the Water Truck Ordinance, as no separate staff report was prepared for the Water Truck Ordinance.
6 Aiso, at the August 3, 2021 hearing, County Counsel advised the Board that public comments on the
Groundwater Permit Ordinance should be included in the record for the Water Truck Ordinance.

00' Lastly, all the public comments at that meeting discussed the Ordinances as part of a single,
9 overarching project, rather than as separate and independent pieces of legislation.

10 93. Accordingly, the Ordinances are part a of a single comprehensive regulatory "project"
11 under CEQA, which was designed to prevent the use of groundwater by anyone allegedly engaged in
12 an unlawful or unpermitted land use, including, in particular, cannabis cultivators. Therefore,
13 Respondents were required to consider the cumulative potential impacts of both Ordinances together,
14 rather than the potential impacts of each Ordinance in isolation.

15 94. Respondents did not do this. The Board found that the Groundwater Ordinance was
16 exempt from CEQA because "it can.be seen with certainty that there is no possibility of a significant
17 effect on the environment from the adoption of this Ordinance establishing an administrative permit

18 process for groundwater, extraction for use off-parcel, as the Ordinance does not itself prohibit or
19 authorize groundwater extraction for any particular parcel or project." Similarly, the Board found that
20 its adoption of the Water Truck Ordinance was exempt from CEQA because "it can be seen with
21 certainty that there is no possibility of a significant effect on the environment from the adoption of
22 these regulations allowing for the restriction of Water Tender Vehicles."

23 95. Indeed, nothing in the record indicates that Respondents ever considered whether the
24| cumulative effect of both Ordinances operating together may cause a significant environmental
25  impact. On its face, the Staff Report Was prepared solely for the Groundwater Permit Ordinance.
26 While some statements could arguably be read to implicitly refer to the Water Truck Ordinance, staff's
27| discussion of the "proposed Ordinance" is always in the singular, and there is never any express
28 acknowledgement or analysis regarding the cumulative impacts of both Ordinances operating together.

|l (8801/002/01312965.DOCX} 28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 96. Even the section of the Staff Report purportedly addressing "cumulative impacts" fails

2 to show that any consideration was given to the Ordinances' collective potential to cause
3 environmental impacts. It states that "the proposed Ordinance does not authorize any new land uses

4 or [sic] changes existing land uses. Rather, the project establishes a permitting process to ensure land
uses are consistent with local and state regulations. Therefore, there would be no cumulative impacts
6 that would result from the proposed Ordinance." Not only is the discussion consistently framed in

7 terms a of a singular "Ordinance" but also no reference is made to any distinctive aspect of the Water

8 Truck Ordinance. Indeed, because the Water Truck Ordinance's permit is discretionary, it cannot be

9 said that it "ensures land uses are consistent with local and state regulations;" it merely authorizes the
10 | Director to request information to aid in the enforcement of the Groundwater Ordinance.

11 97. Accordingly, by failing to consider the potential impacts associated with the entire
12 "project," Respondents improperly piecemealed environmental review in violation of CEQA.

13 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

14 Declaratory Relief

15 98. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs 1 through
1697 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

17 99. A clear and actual controversy exists between Petitioners and Respondents regarding
18 Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA. Petitioners contend that Respondent has not complied
19 with CEQA while Respondent contends to the contrary.

20 100. This controversy between Petitioners and Respondents not only creates substantial

21 danger that Petitioners' rights will be damaged, but also that CEQA will be ignored. As such, a
22 judicial determination as to Petitioners' and Respondents' rights and obligations with respect to CEQA

23 is necessary and desirable.

24 101. There is no other adequate legal remedy available to resolve this controversy.

25 102. The relief requested herein is authorized under Code of Civil Procedure $ 1060.

3 103. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs 1 through

5 104. Unless and until this Court issues an order immediately enjoining and restraining
6 Respondents from implementing the Ordinances, Petitioners will suffer irreparable harm. In recent
7 years, Petitioners' business has relied on income from the sale of groundwater to third parties for off-

8 site use. If the Ordinances are permitted to stand, Petitioners will be unable to generate income in the

9 amount necessary to sustain Petitioners' business, and the business may cease permanently.

10 105. Therefore, Petitioners seek a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and
11 permanent injunction enjoining and restraining Respondents, their agents, servants, employees,
12  independent contractors, and/or any other firm, agency, entity, person or party acting in concert with

13 or under control their control, from taking any action in furtherance of the Ordinances,

Board of Supervisors (collectively, "Respondents") pursuant to the California Environmental
Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA").
Petitioners' allegations are in regards to the August 3, 2021 decision of the
Siskiyou County Board of Supervisors (the "Board) to adopt Ordinances 21-13 and 21-14 (collectively, the "Project") to institute permitting requirements for the extraction of groundwater for off-parcel use and to prohibit water trucks from traversing certain County roadways.

Respondents violated CEQA by, inter alia, failing to proceed in the manner required by law, failing to support their findings by substantial evidence, relying upon inapplicable categorical exemptions notwithstanding substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that the Project would result in significant environmental effects, and impermissible segmentation of environmental review.
Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Very truly yours,
