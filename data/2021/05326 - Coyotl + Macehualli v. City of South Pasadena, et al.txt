VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 INTRODUCTION
1.
2 This lawsuit seeks to enjoin the City of South Pasadena's ("City" or "Respondent")

3 August 11, 2020 and February 23, 2021 actions (and all previous and subsequent actions) approving the
Moffat Street Extension ("Project") and finding that the Project qualifies for a categorical exemption
4 from CEQA review pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15303 as a Class 3 - New Construction or
5 Conversion of Small Structures subject to Conditions of Approval ("Class 3 Exemption" or "Section
6 15303").

7 2. The Project involves approval of a Hillside Development Permit and Tree Removal

8 Permit (Project No. 2191-HDP/TRP) for the street design and extension of Moffatt Street extending

9 600 feet westward from the northern end of Lowell Avenue to serve seven new single-family

10 residential homes in the City of Los Angeles.
3.
11 The Project is located at Moffatt Street extending westward from the northern end of
Lowell Avenue in the City of South Pasadena (*Project Site").
12 4. In approving the Project, Respondent violated the California Environmental Quality Act,
13 Cal. Pub Res. Code section 21000 et seq ("CEQA").
14 PARTIES
15 5. Petitioner Coyotl + Macchualli ("Petitioner"') is a nonprofit public benefit corporation
16 with its principal place of business in Los Angeles County, California.

17 6. Defendant and Respondent City of South Pasadena ("City" or "Respondent") is city

18 located in Los Angeles County, California. The City is responsible for all project approvals.
7.
19 Defendants and Respondents DOES 1 - 10 are entities which the true names, capacities,

20 corporate, and associates are unknown to Petitioner at this time, and who, therefore, are sued using
fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition/Complaint to show the true names and capacities

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
10.
2 This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP")

3 sections 526 (injunctive relief), 1060 (declaratory relief), 1085 (traditional mandate) and 1094.5

4 (administrative mandate), Public Resources Code (*PRC*) section 21168 and 21168.5 (judicial review
under CEQA), and Government Code section 65009 (actions challenging local government decisions).
5 The Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory relief pursuant to CCP § 1060 and injunctive relief §
6 pursuant to CCP section 525 et seq.
7 11. Venue is proper in this Court because the Project Site lies entirely within the County of

8 Los Angeles and the environmental impacts of the Project will be acutely felt in this County. The cause

9 alleged in this Petition, or some part of that cause, arise in this county. CCP § 393; Cal. State Parks

10 Foundation v. Super. Ct. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 826. Venue is also proper in this Court pursuant to

11 Code of Civil Procedure sections 394 (actions against a city, county, or local agency), and 395 (actions

12 generally) since Respondent is in the County of Los Angeles.
12. This petition is timely filed within all applicable limitation periods.
13 13. Petitioner has provided written notice of its intention to file this petition to Respondents
14 in compliance with PRC section§ 21167.5, a true and correct copy of and are including which the
15 notice and proof of service as are attached hereto as Exhibit A.

16 14. Petitioner has concurrently filed a notice of its election to prepare the record of

17 administrative proceedings relating to this action, in compliance with PRC section 21167.6 or other

18 applicable laws, true and correct copy of which notice is attached hereto as Exhibit B.
15.
19 Petitioner has concurrently filed a request for hearing in compliance with PRC section

20 21167.4, a true and correct copy of which request is attached hereto as Exhibit C.
16. Petitioner has concurrently filed and served notice of this lawsuit to the California
21 Attorney General in compliance with PRC section 21167.7 and CCP section 388, a true and correct
22 copy of which notice is attached hereto as Exhibit D.
23 17. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this instant action and has
24 exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law under PRC section 21177. Petitioner
25 and/or other agencies and individuals raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition orally

26 or in writing during the Respondent's decision-making process.

27 18. The violations by Respondent as alleged herein have affected the beneficial interests of

28 Petitioner and/or its supporting members. The relief sought by way of this Petition will redress this

-3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 beneficial interest and the likelihood of future injury and interference with Petitioner's interests, and

2 those of its supporting members.
19. Petitioner has no
3 plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless
this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondent to set aside the certification of 4 the Project and the supporting environmental documents. In the absence of such remedies,
5 Respondent's decisions will remain in effect in violation of state law and injurious to Petitioner and its
6 members.

7 STATUTORY FRAMEWORK

8 California Environmental Quality Act

9 20. The California Environmental Quality Act, Cal. PRC section 21000, et seq ("CEQA")

10 requires state and local agencies to identify the potentially significant environmental impacts of their

11 actions, and then to avoid or mitigate those impacts if feasible.
21.
12 CEQA requires agencies to analyze the potential environmental impacts of its proposed
actions in an environmental impact report (except in certain limited circumstances). The EIR is the very 13 heart of CEQA. Dunn-Edwards v. BAAQMD (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 644, 652. '"The 'foremost principle'
14 in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act to be read so as to afford the fullest
15 possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." Cmtys.
16 for a Better Env't v. Cal. Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.

17 22. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers and

18 the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. 14 Cal. Code of Regs., §

19 15002, subd. (a)(1).' "Its purpose is to inform the public and its responsible officials of the

20 environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR 'protects not only
the environment but also informed self-government.'" Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors 21 (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564. The EIR. has been described as "an environmental 'alarm bell' whose
22 purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have
23 reached ecological points of no return." Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay v. Bd. of Port Comrs. (2001)
24 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1354.

25

26 14 CCR section 15000 et seq. are referred to herein as the "CEQA Guidelines." The CEQA Guidelines, codified in Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations, section 15000 et seq, are regulatory
27 guidelines promulgated by the state Natural Resources Agency for the implementation of CEQA. (Cal.

28 Pub. Res. Code § 21083.) The CEQA Guidelines are given "great weight in interpreting CEQA< except when . clearly unauthorized or erroneous." Center for Biological Diversity v. Department of Fish & Wildlife (2015) 62 Cal. 4th 204, 217. -4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

23. Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage when

2 "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all feasible mitigation measures.

3 CEQA Guidelines, § 15002, subd. (a)(2) and (3); Citizens of Goleta Valley, supra, 52 Cal.3d at 564.
The EIR serves to provide agencies and the public with information about the environmental impacts of
4 a proposed project and to "identify ways that environmental damage can be avoided or significantly
5 reduced." CEQA Guidelines, § 15002, subd. (a)(2).
6 24. To achieve its objectives of environmental protection, CEQA has a three-tiered
7 structure. CEQA Guidelines, § 15002, subd. (k); Comm. to Save the Hollywoodland Specific Plan v.

8 City of Los Angeles (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1185 - 86. First, if a project falls into an exempt

9 category, or it can be seen with certainty that the activity in question will not have a significant effect

10 on the environment, no further agency evaluation is required. Id. Second, if there is a possibility the

11 project will have a significant effect on the environment, the agency must perform a threshold initial
study. Id.; CEQA Guidelines, § 15063 subd. (a). If the study indicates that there is no substantial
12 evidence that the project may cause a significant effect on the environment the agency may issue a
13 negative declaration. Id., CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15063, subd. (b)(2), 15070. Finally, if the project will
14 a have a significant effect on the environment, an environmental impact report ("EIR") is required. Id.
15 CEQA Exemptions

16 25. CEQA exempt activities are either expressly identified by statute (i.e., statutory

17 exemptions, PRC § 21080.01 et seq.; CEQA Guidelines §§ 15261 - 85) or those that fall into one of

18 more than two-dozen classes deemed categorically exempt by the Secretary of Resources (i.e.,

19 categorical exemptions). PRC §§ 21080(b)(10); CEQA Guidelines § 15300. Public agencies utilizing

20 CEQA exemptions must support their determination with substantial evidence. PRC $ 21168.5.
Exemptions to CEQA are narrowly construed and exemption categories are not to be expanded beyond
21 the reasonable scope of their statutory language. Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com.
22 (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 125. A reviewing court must "scrupulously enforce all legislatively mandated
23 CEQA requirements." Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.
24 Erroneous reliance by the City on a categorical exemption constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion
25 and a violation of CEQA. Azusa Land Reclamation Co. V. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997)

26 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1192.

27 26. CEQA identifies certain classes of projects which are exempt from the provisions of

28 CEQA. These are called categorical exemptions. PRC § 21084(a); CEQA Guidelines §§ 15300, 15354.
Categorical exemptions are certain classes of activities that generally do not have a significant effect on
-5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 the environment. Id. Public agencies utilizing such exemptions must support their determination with

2 substantial evidence. PRC § 21168.5. "[f]f the court perceives there was substantial evidence that the

3 project might have an adverse impact, but the agency failed to secure preparation of an EIR, the
agency's action must be set aside because the agency abused its discretion by failing to follow the law." 4 Dunn-Edwards Corp. V. Bay Area Air Quality Mgmt. Dist. (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 644, 656. A
5 categorical exemption may not be invoked for any project that may cause a substantial adverse change
6 in the significance of a historical resource. PRC § 21084(e); CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2(f); Comm. to
7 Save the Hollywoodland Specific Plan v. City of Los Angeles ("Hollywoodland") (2008) 161 Cal. App.

8 4th 1168, 1186.

9 27. CEQA categorical exemptions "are construed narrowly" and will not be unreasonably

10 expanded beyond their terms. County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 91

11 Cal.Rptr.2d 66, 89. Exemptions are strictly construed to construction allow for the fullest possible

12 environmental protections within the reasonable scope of statutory language. CEQA Guidelines o
15003(f); Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal. App.
13 4th 1165, 1192 - 93 ("Azusa"); East Peninsula Ed. Council, Inc. V. Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified
14 School Dist. (1989) 210 Cal. App. 3d 155, 171; Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. V. Regents of
15 University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 390 (rejecting "an attempt to use limited exemptions
16 contained in CEQA as a means to subvert rules regulating the protection of the environment").

17 28. Moreover, certain types of projects are ineligible to be exempt from CEQA even if they

18 otherwise fit within a CEQA categorical exemption. CEQA bars projects that may impact historical

19 resources from being exempt from CEQA review. Subdivision (e) of Section 21084 of the California

20. Public Resources Code states that "[a] project that may cause a substantial adverse change in the
significance of a historical resource, as specified in Section 21084.1, shall not be exempted ..."
21 Section 21084.1 of the California Public Resources Code provides that "[a] project that may cause a
22 substantial adverse change in the significance of an historical resource is a project that may have a
23 significant effect on the environment. See also CEQA Guideline Section 15300.2.

24 29. Finally, a project may not be exempt from CEQA environmental review when there is

25 reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual

26 circumstances. Section 15300.2 subdivision (a) of the CEQA Guidelines states that "a categorical

27 exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will

28 have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances."

H Class 3 CEQA Categorical Exemption

2 30. Construction of small new structures or facilities, installation of small new equipment

3 and facilities in structures, and conversion of existing small structures from one use to another with only

4 minor exterior modifications is permitted exempt's from CEQA's environmental review requirements
pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15303.
5 31.

6 CEQA Guidelines Section 15303 does not exempt Projects if the Project would exceed

7 the scope of the exemption, which section 15303(a) specifies as up to three single-family residential
homes in an urbanized area.

8 32.

9 Street and other minor utility improvements are exempt under Section 15303(d),

10 however, only if they would serve other construction which would also be exempt pursuant to section
15303.

11 Project Piecemealing and Requirement to Analyze the Whole of Action
33.
12 The term "project" refers to the whole of an action and to the underlying activity being

13 approved, not to each governmental approval. CEQA Guidelines §15378(a), (c)-(d); Poet, LLC v. State

14 Air Resources Bd. (2017) 12 Cal. App. 5th 52, 73; California Unions for Reliable Energy v. Mojave

15 Desert Air Quality Mgmt. Dist. (2009) 178 Cal. App. 4th 1225, 1238; River Watch v. Olivenhain Mun.

16 Water Dist. (2009) 170 Cal. App. 4th 1186; Association for a Cleaner Env't v. Yosemite Community

17 College Dist. (2004) 116 Cal. App. 4th 629, 637. This definition ensures that the action reviewed under

18 CEQA is not the approval itself but the development or other activities that will result from the approval.
By referring to the underlying activity, CEQA Guidelines §15378(c) "focuses attention on that which

19 has impact on the environment." Bozung v. LAFCO (1975) 13 Cal. 3d 263, 283. See Azusa Land

20 Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal. App. 4th 1165, 1188 (Regional

21 Water Quality Control Board approval authorizing landfill to be reopened for disposal of additional solid

22 waste obviously is activity that may cause direct physical change to environment).
34.
23 Activities that will operate independently of one another and can be implemented

24 separately may, however, be treated as separate projects under CEQA if one activity is not a foreseeable

25 consequence of the other. See, e.g., Aptos Council v. County of Santa Cruz (2017) 10 Cal. App. 5th 266,

26 281; Paulek v. Department of Water Resources (2014) 231 Cal. App. 4th 35, 46; Banning Ranch

27 Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2012) 211 Cal. App. 4th 1209, 1222; Sierra Club v. West Side
Irrig. Dist. (2005) 128 Cal. App. 4th 690.

28 35.. To ensure that the whole of the action is considered, project descriptions must give an
accurate view of the project as a whole, revealing any indirect or ultimate environmental effects of the
-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

activity being approved. See, e.g., McQueen v Board of Dirs., supra (district improperly defined its

2 proposed activity as acquisition of surplus federal lands for open space but did not describe steps that

3 would have to be taken to clean up and dispose of environmental contaminants on site).
PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL
4 36. This proceeding involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest.
5 Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a substantial benefit on the public, including
6 citizens, residents, businesses and taxpayers of the City, and will result in the enforcement of important
7 public rights by requiring Respondent to comply with CEQA and other legal requirements applicable to

8 the proposed Project; by voiding the Project approvals and prohibiting Respondent and Real Parties in

9 Interest from taking further actions with respect to the Project until it has complied with those legal

10 requirements; and by prohibiting the Respondent from undertaking any portion of the Project until they

11 have fully complied with these legal requirements.
37.
12 Petitioner is entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil Procedure
section 1021.5 when it prevails in this action. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement of
13 these public rights entitle Petitioner to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to that section.
14 STATEMENT OF FACTS
15 38. On or about November 15, 2018, Applicant applied for a Hillside Development Permit

16 for the extension of Moffatt Street westward and a Variance for a +/ 18-foot-high retaining wall along

17 the northern boundary of the proposed private street.

18 39. On or about December of 2020, Applicant withdrew its request for a variance and

19 proposed a new retaining wall design to a be a maximum height of six feet for all portions of the
retaining wall.
20 40. On or about February 26, 2020, the City sent notices regarding a Tree Removal Permit
21 for the removal of five trees being considered for the Project.
22 41. On or about March 10, 2020, the City Planning Commission held a public hearing to
23 consider the Project and continued the proposed Hillside Development Permit and the Tree Removal
24 Permit for the extension of Moffatt Street to allow additional time to provide information.

25 42. On or about August 11, 2020, the City Planning Commission held a public hearing to

26 consider the Project and approved the proposed Hillside Development Permit for the street design of

27 Moffatt Street extending westward from the northern end of Lowell Avenue and a Tree Removal

28 Permit for the removal of five trees, subject to conditions of approval.
43. On August 26, 2020, a member of Petitioner's organization Micah Haserjian submitted
-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

an appeal of the Planning Commission's decision to approve the Project to the City Council.
44. 2 On October 21, 2020, the City Council conducted a public hearing and directed the
Applicant and its Staff to obtain in writing from the City of Los Angeles that the Moffat Street
extension needs to be constructed prior to issuance of any building permits for the construction of
single-family homes in the City of Los Angeles, revision of the conditions of approval to be revised to
5 not allow the Moffatt Street extension without the City of Los Angeles issuing building permits for the
6 homes, and continued the meeting to November 18, 2020.

7 45. On November 18, 2020, the City Council conducted a public hearing on the Project,
8 hearing dial-in voicemail comments from members of the public concerning the Project. The City

9 Council heard only the first 30 minutes of over 2 hours of oral testimony submitted by the public

10 concerning the Project and thereafter continued the hearing on the item,
46.
11 On or about February 17, 2021, the City Council conducted a public hearing, took
testimony regarding the Appeal of the Planning Commission's approval of the Project, and adopted 12 Resolution No. 7705 which made findings and approved the Project.
13 47. Resolution No. 7705 found that the Project merely involved "street improvements of an
14 access easement to landlocked properties in the City of Los Angeles" and categorically exempted the
15 Project from CEQA environmental review under the Class 3 Exemption.

16 48. Resolution No. 7705 imposed a number of conditions of approval on the Project

17 including:

18 a. Condition of Approval P-11 requiring that the Applicating provide

19 "[d]ocumentation from the City of Los Angeles demonstrating approval for the private street
connection to Lowell Avenue.
20 b. Condition of Approval P-12 requires that the Applicant provide
21 "[d]ocumentation from the City of Los Angeles that a preliminary development plans (site plan and
22 elevations) for the construction of all seven (7) lots have been reviewed by the City of Los Angeles
23 Planning and confirmation that the plans as presented will not be subject to discretionary review."
24 C. .Condition of Approval P-14 requires that the Applicant "demonstrate that they
25 received approved building permits from the City of Los Angeles for the seven (7) properties . . .

26 d. Condition of Approval P-15 requires that the Applicant "post a bond in a

27 sufficient amount for maintaining, monitoring, and securing the private road for ten (10) years, or until

28 the applicant demonstrates certificates of occupancy for the seven (7) properties.

e. Condition of Approval P-16 requires that "[i]n the event that no homes are built
-9.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 on the properties listed above (Condition P-15) after ten (10) years, the bond shall be used by the

2 bonding company for the removal of the street improvements.
f.
3 Condition of Approval PW-23 requires that Tree removals associated with
development shall only be conditionally approved subject to the applicant receiving their development
4 building permit ...."
5 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (By Petitioner For Writ of Administrative Mandate Under CCP § 1094.5 and PRC §211168 Or in
7 the Alternative CCP § 1085 and PRC $ 21168.5 Re: Project Ineligibility for CEQA Exemption)

8 49. Petitioner hereby reallege and incorporate all the above paragraphs as if fully set forth

9 herein.

10 50. The City exempted the Project from CEQA under Section 15303 of the CEQA

11 Guidelines which exempts "construction and location of limited numbers of new, small facilities or
structures; installation of small new equipment and facilities in small structures; and the conversion of
12 existing small structures from one use to another where only minor modifications are made in the
13 exterior of the structure."
14 51. However, the Project is ineligible to be exempt from CEQA under Section 15303 of the
15 CEQA Guidelines as the Project is facially inconsistent with the exemption as:
16 a. The Project does not facially quality for the Class 3 Exemption since the

17 extension serves 7 single-family homes when the Class 3 Exemption Class 3 Exemtpion only exempts

18 street improvements of reasonable length serving no more than three single-family residences or

19 apartments, duplexes of no more than six dwelling units in urbanized areas;
b.
20 Section 15303 only exempts the construction of small new facilities or structures
and does not include or otherwise exempt other Project activities such as the proposed tree removal 21 permit
22 C. The City did not consider the whole of the action in finding that the Project was
23 exempt under 15303 of the CEQA Guidelines since the City's exemption finding did not consider or
24| include the environmental impacts of the construction and operation of seven single-family residences

25 that are required as part of the Project.

26 52. As a result of the foregoing defects and others according to proof, Respondent

27 prejudicially abused their discretion by approving the Project and failing to conduct an environmental

28 review and publish either an environmental impact report, mitigated negative declaration or exemption
finding that considers the entire project, that does not comply with CEQA, and by approving the Project

1 in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondent's purported approval of the Project must be set aside.

2 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

) (By Petitioners For Writ of Administrative Mandate Under CCP 8 1094.5 and PRC § 211168 Or

4 in the Alternative CCP § 1085 and PRC § 21168.5, Re: Violations of CEQA; Failure to

53. Substantially Support Factual Findings)

5- forth herein. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates all of the above paragraphs as if fully set

6 54.
7 CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be supported

8 by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that a lead agency provide

9 an explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions it has reached.
55.

10 Respondents violated CEQA in finding that the Project is exempt from CEQA

11 environmental review under Section 15303 of the CEQA Guidelines since the finding was inadequate
as a matter of law and not supported by substantial evidence as:

12 a. The Project does not facially quality for the Class 3 Exemption since the

13 extension serves 7 single-family homes when the Class 3 Exemption Class 3 Exemtpion only exempts

14 street improvements of reasonable length serving no more than three single-family residences or

15 apartments, duplexes of no more than six dwelling units in urbanized areas;
b.
16 Section 15303 only exempts the construction of small new facilities or structures

17 and does not include or otherwise exempt other Project activities such as the proposed tree removal
permit

18 C. The City did not consider the whole of the action in finding that the Project was
19 exempt under 15303 of the CEQA Guidelines since the City's exemption finding did not consider or

20 include the environmental impacts of the construction and operation of seven single-family residences

21 that are required as part of the Project.
56.
22 As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused their discretion by

23 making determinations or adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA and

24 approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondents' approval and exemption of the
Project from CEQA must be set aside.
25 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

26 WHEREFORE, Petitioner pray for judgment as set forth below:

27 A.

28 For a writ of mandate commanding Respondent to vacate any purported approvals of the
Project, and to require Respondent to complete the CEQA environmental review and public comment
period as required by law; -11-

any action to implement the project, unless and until Respondent fully comply with CEQA;
4 C. For a declaration of the rights and duties of the parties hereto, including but not limited
5 to a declaratory judgment that Respondent violated its duty pursuant CEQA and that the project approvals
6 are null and void and without legal effect;

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. This lawsuit seeks to enjoin the City of South Pasadena's ("City" or "Respondent")

3 August 11, 2020 and February 23, 2021 actions (and all previous and subsequent actions) approving the

4 Moffat Street Extension ("Project") and finding that the Project qualifies for a categorical exemption
from CEQA review pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15303 as a Class 3 - New Construction or
5 Conversion of Small Structures subject to Conditions of Approval ("Class 3 Exemption" or "Section
6 15303").

7 2. The Project involves approval of a Hillside Development Permit and Tree Removal

8 Permit (Project No. 2191-HDP/TRP) for the street design and extension of Moffatt Street extending

9 600 feet westward from the northern end of Lowell Avenue to serve seven new single-family

10 residential homes in the City of Los Angeles.
3.
11 The Project is located at Moffatt Street extending westward from the northern end of

12 Lowell Avenue in the City of South Pasadena ("Project Site").
4. In approving the Project, Respondent violated the California Environmental Quality Act,
13 Cal. Pub Res. Code section 21000 et seq ("CEQA").
14 PARTIES

15 5. Petitioner Coyotl + Macehualli (*Petitioner") is a nonprofit public benefit corporation

16 with its principal place of business in Los Angeles County, California.

17 6. Defendant and Respondent City of South Pasadena ("City" or "Respondent") is city

18 located in Los Angeles County, California. The City is responsible for all project approvals.
7.
19 Defendants and Respondents DOES 1 - 10 are entities which the true names, capacities,

20 corporate, and associates are unknown to Petitioner at this time, and who, therefore, are sued using
fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition/Complaint to show the true names and capacities
21 when ascertained.
22 8. Real Party in Interest and Defendant HDP Moffatt Street, LLC, also known as HDP
23 Moffat Street, LLC, ("Real Party" or "Applicant") is a California limited liability company with its

25 Permit for the Project.

26 9. Real Parties in Interest ROES 1 - 10 are entities which the true names, capacities,

27 corporate, and associates are unknown to Petitioner at this time, and who, therefore, are sued using

28 fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition/Complaint to show the true names and capacities
when ascertained.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 10. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP")

3 sections 526 (injunctive relief), 1060 (declaratory relief), 1085 (traditional mandate) and 1094.5
(administrative mandate), Public Resources Code ("PRC") section 21168 and 21168.5 (judicial review
4 under CEQA), and Government Code section 65009 (actions challenging local government decisions).
5 The Court has jurisdiction to issue declaratory relief pursuant to CCP § 1060 and injunctive relief cop
6 pursuant to CCP section 525 et seq.

7 11. Venue is proper in this Court because the Project Site lies entirely within the County of

8 Los Angeles and the environmental impacts of the Project will be acutely felt in this County. The cause

0 alleged in this Petition, or some part of that cause, arise in this county. CCP § 393; Cal. State Parks

10 Foundation v. Super. Ct. (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 826. Venue is also proper in this Court pursuant to

11 Code of Civil Procedure sections 394 (actions against a city, county, or local agency), and 395 (actions
generally) since Respondent is in the County of Los Angeles.
12 12. This petition is timely filed within all applicable limitation periods.
13 13. Petitioner has provided written notice of its intention to file this petition to Respondents
14 in compliance with PRC section§ 21167.5, a true and correct copy of and are including which the
15 notice and proof of service as are attached hereto as Exhibit A.

16 14. Petitioner has concurrently filed a notice of its election to prepare the record of

17 administrative proceedings relating to this action, in compliance with PRC section 21167.6 or other

18 applicable laws, a true and correct copy of which notice is attached hereto as Exhibit B.
15.
19 Petitioner has concurrently filed a request for hearing in compliance with PRC section

20 21167.4, a true and correct copy of which request is attached hereto as Exhibit C.
16. Petitioner has concurrently filed and served notice of this lawsuit to the California
21 Attorney General in compliance with PRC section 21167.7 and CCP section 388, a true and correct
22 copy of which notice is attached hereto as Exhibit D.
23 17. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this instant action and has
24 exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law under PRC section 21177. Petitioner

25 and/or other agencies and individuals raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition orally

26 or in writing during the Respondent's decision-making process.

27 18. The violations by Respondent as alleged herein have affected the beneficial interests of

28 Petitioner and/or its supporting members. The relief sought by way of this Petition will redress this

-3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- beneficial interest and the likelihood of future injury and interference with Petitioner's interests, and

2 those of its supporting members.
19.
3 Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless

4 this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondent to set aside the certification of

5 the Project and the supporting environmental documents. In the absence of such remedies,

6 Respondent's decisions will remain in effect in violation of state law and injurious to Petitioner and its
members.

7 STATUTORY FRAMEWORK

8 California Environmental Quality Act

9 20. The California Environmental Quality Act, Cal. PRC section 21000, et seq ("CEQA")

10 requires state and local agencies to identify the potentially significant environmental impacts of their

11 actions, and then to avoid or mitigate those impacts if feasible.
21.
12 CEQA requires agencies to analyze the potential environmental impacts of its proposed

13 actions in an environmental impact report (except in certain limited circumstances). The EIR is the very

14 heart of CEQA. Dunn-Edwards v. BAAQMD (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 644, 652. "The 'foremost principle'

15 in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act to be read so as to afford the fullest
possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." Cmtys.
a 16 for a Better Env't v. Cal. Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.

17 22. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers and

18 the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. 14 Cal. Code of Regs., §

19 15002, subd. (a)(1).1 "Its purpose is to inform the public and its responsible officials of the

20 environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR 'protects not only

21 the environment but also informed self-government." Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors

22 (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564. The EIR has been described as "an environmental 'alarm bell' whose

23 purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have

24 reached ecological points of no return.' Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay v. Bd. of Port Comrs. (2001)
91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1354.

25

26 14 CCR section 15000 et seq. are referred to herein as the "CEQA Guidelines." The CEQA Guidelines,

27 codified in Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations, section 15000 et seq, are regulatory

28 guidelines promulgated by the state Natural Resources Agency for the implementation of CEQA. (Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 21083.) The CEQA Guidelines are given "great weight in interpreting CEQA< except when . clearly unauthorized or erroneous."Center for Biological Diversity v. Department of Fish & Wildlife (2015) 62 Cal. 4th 204, 217. -4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 23. Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage when

2 "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all feasible mitigation measures.

3 CEQA Guidelines, § 15002, subd. (a)(2) and (3); Citizens of Goleta Valley, supra, 52 Cal.3d at 564.
The EIR serves to provide agencies and the public with information about the environmental impacts of
4 a proposed project and to "identify ways that environmental damage can be avoided or significantly
5 reduced." CEQA Guidelines, § 15002, subd. (a)(2).
6 24. To achieve its objectives of environmental protection, CEQA has a three-tiered
7 structure. CEQA Guidelines, § 15002, subd. (k); Comm. to Save the Hollywoodland Specific Plan v.

8 City of Los Angeles (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1185 - 86. First, if a project falls into an exempt

9 category, or it can be seen with certainty that the activity in question will not have a significant effect

10 on the environment, no further agency evaluation is required. Id. Second, if there is a possibility the

11 project will have a significant effect on the environment, the agency must perform a threshold initial

12 study. Id.; CEQA Guidelines, § 15063 subd. (a). If the study indicates that there is no substantial
evidence that the project may cause a significant effect on the environment the agency may issue a
13 negative declaration. Id., CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15063, subd. (b)(2), 15070. Finally, if the project will
14 have a significant effect on the environment, an environmental impact report ("EIR") is required. Id.
15 CEQA Exemptions

16 25. CEQA exempt activities are either expressly identified by statute (i.e., statutory
17 exemptions, PRC § 21080.01 et seq.; CEQA Guidelines §§ 15261 - 85) or those that fall into one of

18 more than two-dozen classes deemed categorically exempt by the Secretary of Resources (i.e.,

19 categorical exemptions). PRC §§ 21080(b)(10); CEQA Guidelines § 15300. Public agencies utilizing

20 CEQA exemptions must support their determination with substantial evidence. PRC § 21168.5.
Exemptions to CEQA are narrowly construed and exemption categories are not to be expanded beyond 21 the reasonable scope of their statutory language. Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com.
22 (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 125. A reviewing court must "scrupulously enforce all legislatively mandated
23 CEQA requirements." Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.
24 Erroneous reliance by the City on a categorical exemption constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion
25 and a violation of CEQA. Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997)

26 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1192.

27 26. CEQA identifies certain classes of projects which are exempt from the provisions of

28 CEQA. These are called categorical exemptions. PRC § 21084(a); CEQA Guidelines §§ 15300, 15354.
Categorical exemptions are certain classes of activities that generally do not have a significant effect on
-5-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 the environment. Id. Public agencies utilizing such exemptions must support their determination with

2 substantial evidence, PRC $ 21168.5. "[I]f the court perceives there was substantial evidence that the

3 project might have an adverse impact, but the agency failed to secure preparation of an EIR, the
agency's action must be set aside because the agency abused its discretion by failing to follow the law."
4 Dunn-Edwards Corp. v. Bay Area Air Quality Mgmt. Dist. (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 644, 656. A
5 categorical exemption may not be invoked for any project that may cause a substantial adverse change
6 in the significance of a historical resource. PRC § 21084(e); CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2(f); Comm. to
7 Save the Hollywoodland Specific Plan v. City of Los Angeles ("Hollywoodland") (2008) 161 Cal. App.

8 4th 1168, 1186.

9 27. CEQA categorical exemptions "are construed narrowly" and will not be unreasonably

10 expanded beyond their terms. County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 91

11 Cal.Rptr.2d 66, 89. Exemptions are strictly construed to construction allow for the fullest possible

12 environmental protections within the reasonable scope of statutory language. CEQA Guidelines cc2
15003(f); Azusa Land Reclamation Co. V. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal. App.
13 4th 1165, 1192 -93 ("Azusa"); East Peninsula Ed. Council, Inc. v. Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified
14 School Dist. (1989) 210 Cal. App. 3d 155, 171; Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of
15 University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 390 (rejecting "an attempt to use limited exemptions

16 contained in CEQA as a means to subvert rules regulating the protection of the environment").

17 28. Moreover, certain types of projects are ineligible to be exempt from CEQA even if they

18 otherwise fit within a CEQA categorical exemption. CEQA bars projects that may impact historical

19 resources from being exempt from CEQA review. Subdivision (e) of Section 21084 of the California

20 Public Resources Code states that "[a] project that may cause a substantial adverse change in the
significance of a historical resource, as specified in Section 21084.1, shall not be exempted . .."
21 Section 21084.1 of the California Public Resources Code provides that "[a] project that may cause a
22 substantial adverse change in the significance of an historical resource is project that may have a
23 significant effect on the environment. See also CEQA Guideline Section 15300.2.

24 29. a Finally, a project may not be exempt from CEQA environmental review when there is a

25 reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual

26 circumstances. Section 15300.2 subdivision (a) of the CEQA Guidelines states that "a categorical

27 exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will

28 have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.3

1 Class 3 CEQA Categorical Exemption
30.
2 Construction of small new structures or facilities, installation of small new equipment

3 and facilities in structures, and conversion of existing small structures from one use to another with only
minor exterior modifications is permitted exempt's from CEQA's environmental review requirements
4 pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15303.
5 31. CEQA Guidelines Section 15303 does not exempt Projects if the Project would exceed
6 the scope of the exemption, which section 15303(a) specifies as up to three single-family residential
7 homes in an urbanized area.

8 32. Street and other minor utility improvements are exempt under Section 15303(d),

0 however, only if they would serve other construction which would also be exempt pursuant to section

10 15303.

11 Project Piecemealing and Requirement to Analyze the Whole of Action
33.
12 The term "project" refers to the whole of an action and to the underlying activity being
approved, not to each governmental approval. CEQA Guidelines §15378(a), (c)-(d); Poet, LLC v. State
13 Air Resources Bd. (2017) 12 Cal. App. 5th 52, 73; California Unions for Reliable Energy v. Mojave
14 Desert Air Quality Mgmt. Dist. (2009) 178 Cal. App. 4th 1225, 1238; River Watch v. Olivenhain Mun.
15 Water Dist. (2009) 170 Cal. App. 4th 1186; Association for a Cleaner Env't v. Yosemite Community
16 College Dist. (2004) 116 Cal. App. 4th 629, 637. This definition ensures that the action reviewed under

17 CEQA is not the approval itself but the development or other activities that will result from the approval.

18 By referring to the underlying activity, CEQA Guidelines §15378(c) "focuses attention on that which

19 has impact on the environment.3 Bozung v. LÄFCO (1975) 13 Cal. 3d 263, 283. See Azusa Land

20 Reclamation-Co. V. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal. App. 4th 1165, 1188 (Regional
Water Quality Control Board approval authorizing landfill to be reopened for disposal of additional solid 21 waste obviously is activity that may cause direct physical change to environment).
22 34. Activities that will operate independently of one another and can be implemented
23 separately may, however, be treated as separate projects under CEQA if one activity is not a foreseeable
24 consequence of the other. See, e.g., Aptos Council v. County of Santa Cruz (2017) 10 Cal. App. 5th 266,
25 281; Paulek v. Department of Water Resources (2014) 231 Cal. App. 4th 35, 46; Banning Ranch

26 Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2012) 211 Cal. App. 4th 1209, 1222; Sierra Club v. West Side

27 Irrig. Dist. (2005) 128 Cal. App. 4th 690.

PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL
4 36. This proceeding involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest.
5 Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a substantial benefit on the public, including
6 citizens, residents, businesses and taxpayers of the City, and will result in the enforcement of important
7 public rights by requiring Respondent to comply with CEQA and other legal requirements applicable to
8 the proposed Project; by voiding the Project approvals and prohibiting Respondent and Real Parties in

Q Interest from taking further actions with respect to the Project until it has complied with those legal

10 requirements; and by prohibiting the Respondent from undertaking any portion of the Project until they

11 have fully complied with these legal requirements.
37.
12 Petitioner is entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil Procedure
section 1021.5 when it prevails in this action. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement of
13 these public rights entitle Petitioner to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to that section.

-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P an appeal of the Planning Commission's decision to approve the Project to the City Council.
44. On October 21, 2020, the City Council conducted a public hearing and directed the 2 Applicant and its Staff to obtain in writing from the City of Los Angeles that the Moffat Street 3 extension needs to be constructed prior to issuance of any building permits for the construction of 4 single-family homes in the City of Los Angeles, revision of the conditions of approval to be revised to
5 not allow the Moffatt Street extension without the City of Los Angeles issuing building permits for the
6 homes, and continued the meeting to November 18, 2020.
7 45. On November 18, 2020, the City Council conducted a public hearing on the Project,
8 hearing dial-in voicemail comments from members of the public concerning the Project. The City

9 Council heard only the first 30 minutes of over 2 hours of oral testimony submitted by the public

10 concerning the Project and thereafter continued the hearing on the item.
46. On or about February 17, 2021, the City Council conducted a public hearing, took 11 testimony regarding the Appeal of the Planning Commission's approval of the Project, and adopted 12 Resolution No. 7705 which made findings and approved the Project.
13 47. Resolution No. 7705 found that the Project merely involved "street improvements of an
14 access easement to landlocked properties in the City of Los Angeles" and categorically exempted the
15 Project from CEQA environmental review under the Class 3 Exemption.

16 48. Resolution No. 7705 imposed a number of conditions of approval on the Project
17 including:

a. 18 Condition of Approval P-11 requiring that the Applicating provide

19 "[d]ocumentation from the City of Los Angeles demonstrating approval for the private street
connection to Lowell Avenue.
20 b. Condition of Approval P-12 requires that the Applicant provide
21 "[d]ocumentation from the City of Los Angeles that a preliminary development plans (site plan and
22 elevations) for the construction of all seven (7) lots have been reviewed by the City of Los Angeles
23 Planning and confirmation that the plans as presented will not be subject to discretionary review."
24 C. Condition of Approval P-14 requires that the Applicant "demonstrate that they
25 received approved building permits from the City of Los Angeles for the seven (7) properties .

26 d. Condition of Approval P-15 requires that the Applicant "post a bond in a

27 sufficient amount for maintaining, monitoring, and securing the private road for ten (10) years, or until

28 the applicant demonstrates certificates of occupancy for the seven (7) properties.

e. Condition of Approval P-16 requires that "[i]n the event that no homes are built
-9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

on the properties listed above (Condition P-15) after ten (10) years, the bond shall be used by the

2 bonding company for the removal of the street improvements.
f.
3 Condition of Approval PW-23 requires that Tree removals associated with

4 development shall only be conditionally approved subject to the applicant receiving their development
building permit ...."
5 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
6 (By Petitioner For Writ of Administrative Mandate Under CCP § 1094.5 and PRC §211168 Or in
7 the Alternative CCP § 1085 and PRC S 21168.5 Re: Project Ineligibility for CEQA Exemption)

8 49. Petitioner hereby reallege and incorporate all the above paragraphs as if fully set forth

q herein.

10 50. The City exempted the Project from CEQA under Section 15303 of the CEQA

11 Guidelines which exempts "construction and location of limited numbers of new, small facilities or

12 structures; installation of small new equipment and facilities in small structures; and the conversion of
existing small structures from one use to another where only minor modifications are made in the
13 exterior of the structure."
14 51. However, the Project is ineligible to be exempt from CEQA under Section 15303 of the
15 CEQA Guidelines as the Project is facially inconsistent with the exemption as:

16 a. The Project does not facially quality for the Class 3 Exemption since the
17 extension serves 7 single-family homes when the Class Exemption Class 3 Exemtpion only exempts

18 street improvements of reasonable length serving no more than three single-family residences or

19 apartments, duplexes of no more than six dwelling units in urbanized areas;
b.
20 Section 15303 only exempts the construction of small new facilities or structures

21 and does not include or otherwise exempt other Project activities such as the proposed tree removal
permit
22 C. The City did not consider the whole of the action in finding that the Project was
23 exempt under 15303 of the CEQA Guidelines since the City's exemption finding did not consider or
24 include the environmental impacts of the construction and operation of seven single-family residences

25 that are required as part of the Project.

26 52. As a result of the foregoing defects and others according to proof, Respondent

27 prejudicially abused their discretion by approving the Project and failing to conduct an environmental

28 review and publish either an environmental impact report, mitigated negative declaration or exemption
finding that considers the entire project, that does not comply with CEQA, and by approving the Project
-10-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondent's purported approval of the Project must be set aside.

2 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
(By Petitioners For Writ of Administrative Mandate Under CCP § 1094.5 and PRC $ 211168 Or
3 in the Alternative CCP § 1085 and PRC § 21168.5, Re: Violations of CEQA; Failure to

4 Substantially Support Factual Findings)
53.
5 Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates all of the above paragraphs as if fully set
forth herein.
6 54. CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be supported
7 by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that a lead agency provide
8 an explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions it has reached.

9 55. Respondents violated CEQA in finding that the Project is exempt from CEQA

10 environmental review under Section 15303 of the CEQA Guidelines since the finding was inadequate

11 as a matter of law and not supported by substantial evidence as:

12 a. The Project does not facially quality for the Class 3 Exemption since the

13 extension serves 7 single-family homes when the Class 3 Exemption Class 3 Exemtpion only exempts
street improvements of reasonable length serving no more than three single-family residences or
14 apartments, duplexes of no more than six dwelling units in urbanized areas;
15 b. Section 15303 only exempts the construction of small new facilities or structures
16 and does not include or otherwise exempt other Project activities such as the proposed tree removal
17 permit

18 C. The City did not consider the whole of the action in finding that the Project was

19 exempt under 15303 of the CEQA Guidelines since the City's exemption finding did not consider or

20 include the environmental impacts of the construction and operation of seven single-family residences

21 that are required as part of the Project.
56.
22 As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused their discretion by
making determinations or adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA and 23 approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondents' approval and exemption of the
24 Project from CEQA must be set aside.
25 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

26 WHEREFORE, Petitioner pray for judgment as set forth below:

27 A. For : writ of mandate commanding Respondent to vacate any purported approvals of the

28 Project, and to require Respondent to complete the CEQA environmental review and public comment
period as required by law; -11-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

m B. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent

2 injunctions enjoining Respondent and Real Parties in Interest, and their agents, employees, officers or

3 representatives, and all persons acting in concert or participating with Real Parties in Interest from taking
any action to implement the project, unless and until Respondent fully comply with CEQA; 4 C. For a declaration of the rights and duties of the parties hereto, including but not limited
5 to a declaratory judgment that Respondent violated its duty pursuant CEQA and that the project approvals
6 are null and void and without legal effect:
7 D. For Petitioner's fees and costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, as

8 authorized by California Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and any other applicable provisions of

9 law; and
