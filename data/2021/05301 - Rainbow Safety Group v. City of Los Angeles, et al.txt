FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Petitioner, RAINBOW SAFETY GROUP ("Petitioner"), alleges through this Verified
2 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint (*Petition"), as follows:
INTRODUCTION 3

4 1. Petitioner challenges the approval by the City of Los Angeles ("City" or

5 "Respondent") of a Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") and the related approvals and
6 permits designed to facilitate a four-house development project proposed at 430 West Avenue
7 45, and 437, 441 and 451 West Rainbow Avenue, Los Angeles, CA (together, the "Project").
8 The approvals were granted to Real Party in Interest, Abode Lumber Corporation by and through
9its Chief Executive Officer, Don S. Kain.
10 2. The consistent failures of the City to provide, in this era of telecommunications
11 and coronavirus, easily provided mailed or emailed actual notice of its actions to persons whose ® Channel Law Group, d17 LLZ06 12 constitutionally protected property, health and safety interests might be affected by an
13
8 synS "pAja BJJySUM €888 extraordinary real estate development project, are troubling. As set forth in more detail below, in
Hills, Beverly 14 1968-1969 the Project site suffered a massive creeping landslide of steeply sloped bedrock that
15 destroyed eleven homes and Rainbow Avenue. While the site was graded after the landslide
16 finally stopped, the site is not a competent location to place the weight of new construction until
17 the safety of surrounding properties and Rainbow Avenue are secured. This reality is reflected in
18 the City Council's 1979 downplanning of the General Plan's land use designation from Low
19 Residential to Minimum Residential, and correspondingly downzoning the lots from R1 to RE-
20 40 - effectively requiring not more than one house on this geologically unstable site. Even the
21 City Council recognized the seriously deficient geologic conditions at the site by reducing its
22 authorized density by law from 4 to 1.
23 3. In 2005, a previous speculation developer, Jesus Reyes, proposed a four-house
24  project on this same site. The record here establishes that City Planners upon presentation of the
25 2005 Project by Mr. Reyes were willing to try to process the project with a categorical
26 exemption under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") -- no environmental
27

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

review and public comment process at all. Despite objections of constitutionally affected
2 landowners at that time, City Planners approved the project without any environmental review.
3 On appeal to the East Los Angeles Planning Commission, City Planners persisted in their claims
4 that no environmental review was required - recommending that the appeal of the local Mount
5 Washington Homeowners Alliance be denied outright. The Planning Commissioners were

6 incensed at the City's callous disregard of the public's right to know the facts and expert analysis

7 about the landslide, and an ability to test its veracity with CEQA's public review, comment, and
8 participation process.
9 4. In an unprecedented and rare action for Mount Washington, the Planning
10 Commissioners of that time went to the trouble to draft their own substituted findings that the
11 case file record established the existence of unusual circumstances and cumulative construction
d'11'dnoJo Mel jeuueyo 90211 ouns "pAla EUJusi!M €888 12 and pedestrian children impacts on the substandard roadways surrounding the Project site. Based
13 E upon these findings, the Commission found that the City was required to have conducted an
SW!H Beverly 14 initial study to determine what level of environmental review other than exemption from CEQA
15 was lawful. Additionally, the Planning Commissioners observed in their substituted findings that
16 the entire project concept of jamming four houses instead of one on the Project site, consistent
17 with the Northeast Community Plan Land Use Designation and applicable RE-40 zoning, was
pursue the Project. 18 fatally flawed. Mr. Reyes did not further
19 5. Subsequently, another speculation developer, Abode Lumber, acquired the project
20 and picked up where Mr. Reyes left off. City Planners again began processing the case as
21 requiring no environmental review under a categorical exemption. In a troubling set of events
22 from the outset, the City Planners in charge of review of this revised Project failed to enforce a
23 critical public noticing requirement of the local specific plan that requires posting of a sign
24 indicating a land use application has been filed at City Hall. Later, although City Planners
25 determined the Project could not be processed under CEQA without any environmental review,
26 pursuant to certain patterns and practices of the City Planning Department, they refused to
27

3 28

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

provide any mailed or emailed actual notice of the circulation of a proposed Mitigate Negative
2 Declaration to persons whose constitutionally protected property, health, and safety interests
3 were endangered by the landslide condition of the property. Giving only the barest notice in a
4 single publication in tiny typeface in the print edition (not the online version) of the Los Angeles
5 Times, the City's failures obtained a result that could be reported later to City officials: No one

6 cared enough to submit comments during CEQA's official public review and comment period.

7 Of course, this was not true. The persons who might care, and who were constitutionally entitled
to notice of the project application under the Specific Plan, and notice of the release of the MND
9 for public review and comment, appear to have been purposely left in the dark until it was too 8

10 late to participate fully in CEQA's statutory public participation process.
6. Within this problematic context, Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set 8
LLZ06 d77 Channel Law Group, 12 aside, rescind and void all of the permits and approvals ("Project Approvals") adopted by the 11

13 City in order to facilitate the Project. The Project was finally approved by the City of Los 8 BInS "pAS EIJYS|!M E8€8 'SIl!H Áueseg 15 Approvals because Respondent failed to comply with the provisions set forth under the 14 Angeles on or about March 17, 2020. Petitioner requests that the Court vacate the Project

16 California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA"),
17 provisions of the California and U.S. Constitution, the State Planning and Zoning Law, and local
18 laws and therefore failed to proceed in a manner required by law.
Petitioner additionally seeks declaratory and injunctive relief barring Respondent
20 City's pattern and practice of giving notice of the availability of environmental documents such 19 7.

21 as the MND in this case only in the Los Angeles Times printed newspaper, failing to mail or
email actual notice of release of environmental documents for review and comment to those with
23 constitutionally protected rights, and failing to distribute to public agencies and make available 22

24 on its website all of the supporting technical studies that support the City's decision to consider
25 adoption of an exemption, negative declaration or mitigated negative declaration. Such notice
26 practices of the City, as to persons adjacent to or likely adversely affected by a project, is not a
27

28

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 method of notice reasonably calculated to result in to actual notice of the availability of
2 environmental documents for review and comment. Additionally, even if somehow a member of
3 the public learns that a proposed negative declaration or a MND is posted on the City's website,

4 the failure of the City to consistently post all supporting technical studies as well, particularly

5 during a time of pandemic where (for the foreseeable future) a visit to City Hall to inspect a
physical file places vulnerable members of the public at unnecessary risk to their health and
7 safety, improperly thwarts CEQA's public participation mandate. As a result of these patterns
8 and practices, contrary to minimum notice requirements of the California and U.S. Constitutions
and the public's paramount interest in CEQA's public participation process, the City often
10 successfully discourages or prevents submission of comments during CEQA's statutorily
11 mandated public comment period. These practices should be barred by the Court in a declaratory
90211 DEA  r  r a go SAIPONE H B IA A G E RECOE 'SIIH ÁueAS 12 judgment determining the rights of the parties and the interested public.
13 PARTIES
14 8. Petitioner, RAINBOW SAFETY GROUP, is an unincorporated association
15 dedicated to the protection of both the community and the environment of the Rainbow Canyon
16 area of Los Angeles's Mount Washington neighborhood. Petitioner and its respective members
17 have a direct and substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondent complies with the
18 environmental protection laws of the state, the City's General Plan Northeast Community Plan,
19 the Mount Washington/Glassell Park Specific Plan, the Los Angeles Municipal Code, and the
20 provisions of the California and United States Constitutions. Petitioner and its respective
21 members are adversely affected by Respondent's failure to comply with CEQA in approving the
22 Project. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because Petitioner and
23 its members' property, personal health/safety, and environmental intorests are directly and
24 adversely affected by Respondent's actions leading up to and including approval of the Project.
25 Petitioner's members participated in the approval process for the Project once they finally
26 became aware of it, supported the administrative appeal of the decision of the Zoning

Administrator, and submitted written comments to the East Los Angeles Arca Planning
2 Commission, and City Council during the administrative appeals.
3 9. Respondent and Defendant, CITY OF LOS ANGELES (the "City"), is a charter
4 city incorporated under the laws of the State of California. The City is the lead agency under
5 CEQA.

6 10. Respondent and Defendant, ABODE LUMBER CORPORATION ("Real Party"),
7 acting by and through its Chief Executive Officer, DON S. KAIN, is the applicant and developer
8 of the Project. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of additional Real Parties
9 sued herein as DOES 1-25, inclusive, and therefore sues these Real Parties by such fictitious

10 names. Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacitics of fictitiously

8 11 named Real Parties in Interest. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each Channel ME7 *dnoJ9 d71 41Z06 EI S MPINES LHL S RA D S SIIH Aueneg 12 Respondent designated herein as a DOE has some responsibility for the events and happenings
13 alleged in this Petition.
14 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
15 11. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1094.5 of the Code
16 of Civil Procedure, and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.
17 12. This Court also has jurisdiction over the traditional mandamus action under
18 section 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
19 13. This Court also has jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment action under
20 section 1060 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
21 14. Venue for this action properly lies in the Los Angeles Superior Court because
22 Respondent and the Project are located in Los Angeles County pursuant to Code of Civil
23 Procedure § 394.

24 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

25 15. The Project proposes to construct four single-family homes on four contiguous
26 lots where the Los Angeles General Plan - Northeast Community Plan and the RE-40 zoning

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 With knowledge of the troubled geologic history and stability of the project site,
the 1979 Northeast Community Plan adopted by the City Council downplanned the subject four 18.

3 lots from Low Residential, which is consistent with R1-1 zoning, to Minimum Residential which 2

4 is consistent with minimum lot sizes ranging from 9,000 square fect to 40,000 square feet,

5 greater street frontages, and lower housing density. In 1988-1990, when the City made its

6 zoning in the Northeast Community Plan area consistent with the General Plan Land Use
7 Designations, the subject lots were downzoned to RE-40, meaning that the lots must have
8 minimum street frontage and lot area in order to assure that this extremely sensitive geologic
9 land mass is not developed again with more dense and unsafe density of former R1-1 zoning on
10| the land.
11 In 2005, a prior developer, Jesus Reyes, owned these same lots. He filed ® d77 4dn015 MB7 Channel L1Z06 applications to develop four single-family homes on these same four lots (*2005 Project"). In 19.

8 euns *pala eUJysIm €868 13 this prior proceeding, the Director of Planning approved the 2005 Project. Upon appeal by the 12

'SIlIH Áueneg 14 Mount Washington Homeowners Alliance, the East Los Angeles Planning Commission granted
15 the appeal, overturned the use of a Categorical Exemption as the environmental review
16 document, overturned the Planning Director's approvals of the four houses, and made factual
17 findings. In their July 24, 2006 Letter of Determination for each lot, the East Los Angeles Area
18 Planning Commissioners found that substantial evidence existed in the record showing potential
19 significant impacts on Rainbow Canyon Park owned by the Santa Monica Mountains
20 Conservancy, impacts on the Carlin G. Smith Recreation Center used by the neighborhood's
21 children, traffic impacts on the winding, narrow street infrastructure, and the impact on land use
because the lots had been downplanned to Minimum Residential and downzoned from R1-1 to
23 RE-40 zoning to prevent R1-1 development intensity on the unmitigated land slide mass that 22

24 extends downhill into the open space parkland owned by the Santa Monica Mountains
25 Conservancy. It its decision, the Planning Commissioners observed that "Zoning is restricted to
26 minimum residential density and project as well as site does not meet minimum lot and yard

1 requirements." Subsequently, Jesus Reyes abandoned the 2005 Project.

2 20. In the years leading up to the four house applications filed for this Project, the
3 record shows that project plans were reviewed by the Grading Division of the City's Department
4 of Building and Safety. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that these
5 reviews included the Geology and Soils Report Approval Letter (March 16, 2015), all previous
6 reports for the site, LADBS Grading Division Correction Letters dated June 28, 2006, and July
7 21, 2014. The various geotechnical reports prepared for the 2005 Project version, as well as the
8 2016 Project version challenged herein, contemplated the massive remedial grading of all four of
9 the lots down to competent bedrock, sifting of the soil to remove uncertified fill (debris of
10 previously destroyed houses), movement of the soil back to the pads of the proposed four houses,
11
8 and the pounding of all this soil to compact it to certain standards, The 2016 Project also
Channel Law Group, LLP euns "pAg EJIySI!M €8€8 •LZ06 12 contemplated the use of drilled caissons at various locations on the property lines of the four lots,

8 13 immediately adjacent to next-door property owners. The project did not propose any remedial
• Beverly Hills, 14 work to remediate the soil downhill beneath Rainbow Avenue to stabilize the roadway. Nor did
15 it propose remedial work to stabilize/anchor the toe of the landslide mass in Rainbow Canyon
16 Park or on any of the lots downhill from Rainbow Avenue on the landslide mass.
17 21, On or about September 28, 2016, Real Party Abode Lumber Corporation, through
18 its Chief Executive Officer, Don Kain ("Abode"), filed four applications to develop a project
19  substantially similar to the 2005 Project: four single-family homes on four downplanned and
20| downzoned lots contrary to the general plan and applicable zoning as previously found by the
21 East Los Angeles Planning Commission. On the application, Abode sought to construct the
22 project under four categorical exemptions without any environmental review. Although the
23 City's application requires disclosure of 500 feet proximity to a sensitive use such as a park or
24 recreation center, Abode on its application for ZA-2016-3715-ZAD-SPP (430 West Avenue 45)
25 failed to disclose the existence of the Carlin G. Smith Recreation Center and its outdoor trail,
26 playgrounds and basketball court across the street from the lot, and failed to disclose the
27

28 9

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 existence of the heavily wooded and brushy Rainbow Canyon Park approximately 150 feet away
2 from the lot. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that similar omissions
3 on the other three applications for the other houses in the 2016 Project applied for by appear

4 Abode. Additionally, the City's application on page 3 of 8 required disclosure of previous cases
5 or environmental clearances for the project site. On the application for ZA-2016-3715-ZAD-

6 SPP (430 West Avenue 45), Abode affirmatively represented that there were no previous cases,
7 or environmental review. This representation was without factual basis as the 2005 Project case

8 numbers and environmental clearances were readily accessible to Abode online in the City's
9 Zoning Information and Management Access System ("ZIMAS"). Petitioner is informed and
10 believes, and thereon alleges that, as an experienced speculation real estate developer, Abode
11 would have known the prior geologic, land, zoning, and environmental review status of the 6 d'11 'dnoug MeT jeuueyo LIZ06 22. At the time of project application, the City requires an applicant to prepare and 12 properties it purchased.

8 euns "pAIa EJJysIM €8€8 SIlH Áuereg 14 submit a radius map of all property owners within 500 feet of the outer boundaries of the Project. 13

15 Based upon this radius map, the City also required submittal of Property Owners Mailing Labels
16 for property owners or tenants within 500 feet, and an Abutting Property Owners Mail Labels.
17 Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that the Mailing Labels prepared for the
2016 Project application failed to include labels properly addressed to the Los Angeles
19 Department of Recreation, as owner and operator of the Carlin G. Smith Recreation Center, and 18

20 the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, as owner and operator of Rainbow Canyon Park.
21 23. Section 8(E)(2) of the Mount Washington/Glassell Park Specific Plan contains a
22 protection of the due process rights of nearby property owners. That section mandates that
23 within five days of filing of a Project application for a Permit Compliance Determination, the
24 applicant is required to post on the subject property a City-Planning-provided "Notice of Intent"
sign. The Notice of Intent sign provides the interested public with the planning case number and
26 | notification that an application for development has been filed with the City. Pursuant to such 25

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 notice, members of the public can know that a development affecting their property and safety
2 interests has been filed, and can review the Project file, make copies, review the project proposal,
3 and begin a consultation process with experts, if necessary. Petitioner is informed and believes,
4 and thereon alleges, that Abode failed to comply with this due-process-noticing protection for
5 each of the four properties proposed on the four contiguous lots, and the City failed to enforce it

6 when it was not performed.

7 24. The Notice of Intent sign requirement of the Mount Washington/Glassell Park
8 Specific Plan is a substantive procedural right of nearby landowners and tenants, granted by the
9 laws of the City, to protect an affected person's "right to know" of the existence of a
10 development proposal likely to impact their property rights, health, and safety. The significance
11
8 of this "right to know" is heightened given the potential noise, ground vibration, and air quality
Channel Law Group, LLP BHNS "PAIE EJYSIM €888 -LZ06 12 dust emissions from the remedial grading of this Project estimated to amount to approximately

8 13 17,000 cubic yards (according to Abode's own reports).
Beverly 'SIl!H 14 25. As a result of the failure to post the required Notice of Intent signs, no one in the
15 affected area of the proposed 2016 Project was aware of the pending application before the City
16 for at a minimum of one year and four months. Meanwhile, Abode and its consultants freely met
17 with City officials to discuss the Project proposal, and its environmental review, without anyone
18  affected by the Project knowing any review was underway,
19 26. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that the City knew of the
20 I previous successful appeal of the 2005 Project, and the massive amounts of remedial grading
21 required for the proposed project, and accordingly took this past history into account in planning
22 the release date of the environmental review for CEQA purposes, and the extent of public notice
23 of the release inviting public comment.
24 27. On or about December 8, 2017, a proposed Mitigated Negative Declaration
25 ("MND") was filed in the City Clerk's office and the MND was allegedly made available on the
26 City's website on December 14, 2017. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges,

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 that the placement of the MND buried in multiple subpages of the City Planning Department's

3 and New Year's holidays, with comments of the public due not later than January 3, 2018, the
4 first business day after the holiday season.
5 28. The City's notice to the public of the availability of the MND for review and

6 public comment was published notice in the Thursday print edition of the Los Angeles Times.

15 of mailing labels and use them to give actual mailed notice of the availability of the MND for
16 | public review and comment within CEQA's official public participation period.
17 31. Although the City Planners know the email and mailing addresses of the Arroyo
18 Seco Neighborhood Council, a City Charter-created entity for providing input into City decision

20 not establish that the City Planning staff mailed or emailed the MND notice to the Arroyo Seco
21 Neighborhood Council or any of its officers.
22 32. Although the City Planners know the email and mailing address of the Mount
23 Washington Homeowners Alliance ("MWHA"), the advocacy group in the affected area that
24  prevailed on the appeal of the 2005 Project, the City Planners did not send any copy of the MND
25 notice to the MWHA or its land use committee members who they had to know would have been
26 interested in participating in CEQA's formal review and comment process.

1 33. Even though Abode's radius map for owners within 500 feet depicts the City

2 parkland of the Carlin G. Smith Recreation Center directly across the street from the Project site,
3 the record does not show the City's Recreation Department was engaged at any time during
4 preparation of the MND, or at the time of circulation of the MND notice inviting comment.
5 34. Even though Abode's radius map of owners within 500 feet depicts nearly the

6 entire Rainbow Canyon Park to be within 500 feet of the boundaries of the Project, the record
7 does not show that the City Planners consulted with the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy

8 or the California Department of Fish and Wildlife during preparation of the MND, or followed
9 the requirements of CEQA to send to state agencies like the Conservancy and the Department a
10 copy of the MND and supporting appendices through the State Clearinghouse to invite review
11 and comment. Additionally, the record does not show that the City Planners mailed or emailed a 8 d17 dnoJo MEl jauueu: LIZ06 12 FAR PAIS THA IMA B CO 'SITH Áuereg copy of the MND or its appendices (including the geological studies and all former approval
13 letters) directly to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, or provided the Department with
14 its proposed mitigation measures regarding impacts on native plant communitics, wildlife bird
15 habitat impacts, and the City's proposed mitigation measures.
16 35. On the City's Planning Department website, as of the time of the filing of this
17 lawsuit, the City only posted the 63-page MND which included only a tree report for each of the
18 four lots. While the MND stated that its conclusions of no significant geologic impact were

19 supported by a geology and soils report submitted to the LADBS, and approved in a letter dated
20 March 15, 2016, the geologic report and approval letter referred to in the MND were not posted
21 so that the public could download and review the supporting evidence relied upon by the City in
22 the MND's conclusions.

23 36. The MND, in its Project Description (nor elsewhere in the document), failed to
24 disclose the 1968/1969 landslide, the 11 destroyed homes on the landslide mass, the proposed

2 unaware that their substantial procedural public participation rights were at risk of denial at the
3 hands of the City's deficient noticing practices.

4 39. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that in February 2018,
5 the City Planners used the mailing labels Abode submitted at the time of its September 2016
6 application to mail notice of a joint Zoning Administrator Hearing and Hearing Officer hearing
7 on the requested discretionary entitlements for the Project. The hearing was scheduled for
8 March 20, 2018. With this mailed notice, the affected property owners and tenants within the
9 area of the Project first learned of the proposed Project. The community had not more than
10 approximately 25 days to prepare for the public hearing, while the City, in failing to enforce the
8 11 Notice of Intent sign requirement of the Specific Plan, allowed the developer years to prepare for Channel Law Group, d77 LIZ06 12 the hearing.
13 40. On March 19, 2018, the City prepared a Mitigation Monitoring Program for the 8 BINS "PAIE EJLYSIIM E8E8 'SIIH Aueneg 14 MND that was based upon the receipt of no comments on the MND. Thus, the Project was
15 further solidified in the administrative process before the public or any of the state trustee
16 agencies had any meaningful input opportunity. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon
17 alleges that the Mitigation Monitoring Program was merely shared with Abode and placed in the
18 file. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that it was not posted on the City
19 website, and no notice of its existence was given to anyone other than Abode in the days leading
20 up to the public hearing.
21 41. In the days leading up to the March 20, 2018 hearing, community members
22 provided comments about the project and identified some of the glaring deficiencies described in
23 this Petition.

24 42. Although usually a Zoning Administrator issues a determination within a month
25 or SO after a public hearing, that did not occur in this case. The record demonstrates that
26 significant issues had been raised at the public hearing. Six months after the public hearing,

Abode submitted an argument letter trying to rebut issues raised concerning the adequacy of the

1 This was not a mere supplement, it was significant new information added to the MND, and
2 never before exposed to public review and comment. Petitioner is informed and believes, and
3 thereon alleges, that the fact that this information was belatedly added to the MND was a
concession by the City that a plain explanation of the nature and extent of the size, scope and
5 boundaries of the landslide mass was suppressed and omitted from the original MND. Even after

6 this "technical correction," the MND still failed to disclose that the toe of the un-remediated slide
1 lay on state park land managed by the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy.
8 44. The First Errata, for the first time ever, added a full listing of the names of
9  geotechnical and soil reports prepared for Jesus Reyes and Abode over the years, and it attached
10 a new memorandum that purported to describe the remedial grading process proposed for the

0548 11 Project. Additionally, the City claimed that the City's grading division's review of the

Channel Law Group, -I706

15 protective measures, not all of which are required by law or regulation, The grading division's

17 imposed by the City in its grading and soils report approval letters under the authority of CEQA.
18 None of these grading mitigation measures were disclosed to the public in the MND where they
19 were required to be exposed to public review and comment.
20 45. On August 2, 2019, the Zoning Administrator issued a Letter of Determination
21 adopting the MND for the project, and approved a variance from LAMC § 12.21C.10(i)(3) and a
22 Project Permit Compliance approval under LAMC § 11.5.7C for each of four single-family

16 CEOA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

17 54. The California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), found at Public Resources
18 Code Section 21000, et seq., is based on the principle that "the maintenance of a quality
19 environment for the people of this state now and in the future is a matter of statewide concern." is
20 (Pub. Res. Code 21000(a).)
21 55. In CEQA, the Legislature has established procedures designed to achieve these
22 goals, principally the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"). These procedures provide both for
23| the determination and for full public disclosure of the potential adverse effects on the
24 environment of discretionary projects that governmental agencies propose to approve, and
25 require a description of feasible alternatives to such proposed projects and feasible mitigation
26 measures to lessen their environmental harm. (Pub. Res. Code § 21002.)
27

28 19

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 56. CEQA is not merely a procedural statute; it imposes clear and substantive
2 responsibilities on agencies that propose to approve projects, requiring that public agencies not
3 approve projects that harm the environment unless and until all feasible mitigation measures are
4 employed to minimize that harm. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21002.1(b).)

57. Failure either to comply with the substantive requirements of CEQA or to carry
out the full CEQA procedures so that complete information as to a project's impacts is developed
7 and publicly disclosed constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion that requires invalidation of 6

8 the public agency action regardless of whether full compliance would have produced a
different result. (Pub. Res. Code § 21005.)
10 58. CEQA authorizes and directs the State Office of Planning and Research to adopt
11 guidelines for the implementation of CEQA by public agencies. (Pub. Res. Code § 21083.)
LZ06 OSAP  F E euns "PALE BJJYSI!M €888 12 These guidelines, which are found at title 14, California Code of Regulations, Section 15000, et

18 environmental analysis is commenced. . .." (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15125(a).)

60. Agencies may not undertake actions that could have a significant adverse effect
20 on the environment, or limit the choice of alternatives or mitigation measures, before complying 19

21 with CEQA. (14 Cal. § Code Regs. § 15004(b)(2).)
22 61. The Guidelines require "all phases of project planning, implementation, and
23 operation" to be considered in the Initial Study for a project. (14 Cal. Code Regs. §
24 15063(a)(1).) CEQA defines a project as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for
25 resulting in either a direct physical change to the environment, or a reasonably foresecable
26 indirect physical change in the environment." (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15378(a).)

4 63. An EIR must be prepared "[i]f there is substantial evidence, in light of the whole

5 record before the lead agency, that the project may have a significant effect on the environment. .

6 (Pub. Res. Code § 21080(d).) That is, an EIR must be prepared "if a lead agency is
7 presented with a fair argument that the project may have a significant effect on the environment .
8 even though it may also be presented with other substantial evidence that the project will not
9 have a significant effect." (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15064(f)(1).)
10 64. Under specific and limited circumstances, the public agency evaluating a
11 proposed project may find that an EIR is not required. In such cases, the agency may adopt a 09L GUNS "PAIE BJJYSIM E888 d17 'dnoJ9 MET |ouueyo -IZ06 12 negative declaration or a mitigated negative declaration ("MND"). A negative declaration may

'SIIH AUeAS 14 environment and does not require the preparation of an environmental impact report." (Pub. Res.
15 Code § 21064.) An MND may be prepared or adopted when "revisions in the project plans . ..
16 would avoid the effects or mitigate the effects to point where clearly no significant effect on
17 the environment would occur" and "there is not substantial evidence in light of the whole record
as revised, may have significant effect on the 18 before the public agency that the project,
19 environment." (Pub. Res. Code § 21064.5., emphasis added) If either of these conditions does

4 67. Any violation of CEQA procedural requirements that deprives the public of the

5 ability to meaningfully participate is prejudicial and requires setting aside the environmental

6 document and project approvals until such time as the public agency complies with CEQA

18 Project may cause significant, unmitigable impacts to the environment, including but not limited
19 to land use, wildfire risk, grading, noise, air quality and health risks, greenhouse gases, and
20 further, that the City failed to provide a complete Project description, including an accurate
21 history of the project site so as to permit the public the ability to meaningfully participate in the

4 inadequate facts, lacking any analysis of facts, or consisting of a superficial and conclusory
5 "analysis" which for the most part simply assumes its conclusion.
6 71. By adopting the MND, the City, purporting to act as lead agency, has

18 Failure to Conduct Any Consultation With Trustee Agencies; Failure to Circulate The MND
19 Through The State Clearinghouse To Obtain Public Comment of the Trustee Agencies
20 74. A "trustee agency" is defined in Public Resources Code as "a state agency that
21 has jurisdiction by law over natural resources affected by: project, that are held in trust for the
22 people of the State of California." Public Resources Code § 21070. The CEQA Guidelines state
23 that a trustee agency "means a state agency having jurisdiction by law over natural resources
24 affected by a project" which are held in trust for the people of the State of California.
25 75. In this case, trustee agencies include: "The California Department of Fish and

decision makers of relevant information needed to make an informed environmental decision.

17 space park areas maintained and operated by the Conservancy are required to be open to the

2 administrative remedies, because the Department of Fish and Game, a trustee agency, had not
3 been given legally required notice. In that case the lead agency had provided adequate notice to
4 the public. The court held that members of the public did not have to exhaust their administrative
5 remedies on this issue, because the agency had not provided a notice of intent to adopt the
6 mitigated negative declaration to the Department of Fish and Game nor sent a copy of the
7 mitigated negative declaration to the State Clearinghouse.

East Los Angeles Planning Commission concluded the Project violated the General Plan Land

8 develop the same land that ended in a binding Planning Commission decision was required as

19 91. The MND also failed to disclose that the Project lies within a Very High Fire
20 Hazard Severity Zone that places the area at the state's highest risk of death and injury due to
21 wildfire. The MND, in reliance on this omission, undertook no analysis of the wildfire risk
22 adjacent to Rainbow Canyon Park, a densely wooded and brushy area, and how the four homes
23

24 could affect emergency vehicle access during construction if there was wildfire, and further
impose inappropriate densification of housing in such a high-risk arca where the City Council
25 previously downplanned and downzoned troubled lots in hillside areas of Northeast Los Angeles.

1 General Plan Land Use Designation of Minimum Residential and RE-40 zoning. None of the
2 lots complied with the Northeast Community Plan Land Use Designation or the RE-40 zoning,
yet the MND asserted without any explanation that the general plan and zoning permits "One
4 unit per lot" without any analysis or justification. The 1979 Northeast Community Plan's EIR 3

5 adopted the downplanning to Minimum Residential as an adopted mitigation measure. In 1988-

6 1990, the City under its consent decree, imposed RE-40 zoning to force owners of contiguous
7 lots to combine them into less dense project sites. In the current 1998 Northeast Community

These are just a handful of the most glaring omissions from the project
17 description, analysis, and mitigation measures proposed by the City in the original MND. When 16 93.

18 all of these deficiencies were raised in the administrative proceedings, along with a demand that
19 the MND's obvious deficiencies be remedied by re-circulating proper full disclosure document,
20 the City Planners, like they did in 2005, simply refused to do so.
21 94. Even worse, the City allowed Abode and its consultants to propose two Notices of
22 Errata. The First Notice of Errata belatedly proposed changes to the project description, such a
23  providing a new, yet still deficient, disclosure of the 1968-1969 landslide, as if that was a mere a
24 technical change, and not a fundamental information failure of the original MND circulated to

4 Abode with a mere Notice of Errata.

5 95. Finally, just 13 days prior to the City Council's PLUM hearing, the City issued

6 the Second Notice of Errata. Attached thereto, the City dumped into the administrative record 86

7 pages of technical noise, air emissions, and greenhouse gas analysis for the Project. These were
8 not, as the City claimed, "supplements" to the studies and analysis in the original MND. They
were studies that were required to be circulated as part of the MND in the first place because the
10 original MND had no such technical studies at all. The public and relevant state agencies could
11
Shannel Law Croug,il H5o not review these technical studies during an official public review period, comment on them, and

15 City Planners to deprive Petitioner and the public of their right to consult with technical experts
16 and, if necessary, prepare countervailing expert analysis and evidence.
17 96. For all of these reasons, the refusals of the City from March 2018 through March
18 2020, a two-year period, to simply correct the informational deficiencies of the MND by
19 recirculation of a proper document for a transparent environmental review, was a failure to

1 findings that the proposed project is consistent with the General Plan as expressed in the

3 designations are directly linked to the planning process where over the life of a community plan,
4 the City estimates the amount of population that must be accommodated, and then density is

5 allocated over the plan area through the use of land use designations.

6 99. The Northeast Community Plan designates the subject lots as Minimum

7 Residential that is a less dense designation than the former Low Residential designation on the
8 lot. At no time during the 1979 or 1998 Northeast Community Planning processes, or in the Plan

9 itself, did the City give notice that the zoning provision enacted in the 1960s might somehow be
10 later used to override the Minimum Residential land use designation assigned to these four lots.
11 Our Supreme Court has recently ruled that a city's general planning process must disclose such

17 consistent with the applicable (and supreme) Minimum Residential Land Use Designation.

19 street frontage or the required minimum lot size of 40,000 square feet. These lots were

21 the City claiming that it could not require contiguous lot owners to combine such lots to comply,
22to the maximum extent possible, with the less dense Land Use Designation and corresponding
23 RE-40 zoning. As long as the owner can receive financial benefit from a less dense development
24 of his land, the City may constitutionally enforce the downplanning and downzoning of these

To Whom It May Concern:
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under California Public Resources Code section 21167.5, that Petitioner, Rainbow Safety Group, intends to immediately file a Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition") under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), inter alia, against the City of Los Angeles ("City"). The Petition will be filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court and will allege, inter alia, that the City did not comply with the California Environmental Quality Act when it approved a four-home development project on Rainbow Avenue and Avenuc 45 ("Project"). Namely, the City improperly concluded that the Project would not have a significant effect on the environment and adopted a Mitigated Negative Declaration. Further, the Petition will allege that the City abused its discretion when it approved the Project because the Project does not conform to all applicable zoning and municipal code regulations. A copy of the Notice of Determination filed by the City of Los Angeles for the Project is attached hereto as Exhibit A.
Sincerely, 94o
