Case No.

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the September 14, 2021 decision of the City of San Jose
3 and its City Council (collectively, "City" or "Respondents") to approve the Almaden Office

4 Project, including a Special Use Permit and Vesting Tentative Map, ("the Project") and to
5 certify a supplemental environmental impact report ("SEIR") for the Project. The Project as
6 approved by the City authorizes the development of two 16-story office buildings and up to 15
7 commercial condominium units on a 3.57-acre site, immediately adjacent to the Guadalupe
8 River, the Guadalupe River Trail, and surrounding riparian area.

9 2. The Project comes at a substantial environmental cost. The Project would crowd
10 the Guadalupe River Trail and riparian area with an imposing 16-story glass building, which

11 will significantly degrade existing riparian habitat, both through physical encroachment and by
12 shading the area, which is expected to harm the long-term health and growth of plants. The
13 Project's large glass towers also endanger native and migrating birds by increasing the risk of
14  collisions.

15 3. Ignoring the advice of environmental organizations such as Sierra Club, along
16 with the express intent of San Jose citizens to preserve riparian resources, the City approved the
17 project in violation of its own 2040 general plan ("General Plan"), including provisions adopted
18 to protect biological and natural resources that the Project will destroy. These General Plan
19 policies require new buildings in existing urban infill areas to have a minimum 100-foot setback
20 from riparian habitats, which can only be decreased in limited circumstances where no
21 environmental impact will occur. However, under no circumstances can the setback be less than
22 30 feet. Here, the Project will not only significantly impact the surrounding environment, but its
23 setback is less than 30 feet. Indeed, the Project setback would range from approximately zero to
24 24 feet from the riparian corridor. The Project does not comply with the General Plan's
25 mandatory riparian protections, and thus violates State Planning and Zoning Law.
26 4. In approving the Project, the City also violated the California Environmental
27 Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code section 2100 et seq., and the CEQA Guidelines,
28 title 14, California Code of Regulations section 1500 et seq. Since its inception, the
2
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Injunctive Relief
Case No.

environmental review of this Project has been riddled with vast inconsistencies and
2 inadequacies. The SEIR and City failed to comply with even the most basic CEQA
3 requirements, beginning with an inadequate project description and continuing with inadequate

4 analysis and mitigation of the Project's numerous impacts on the environment, including but not

5 limited to, effects on hydrology, water quality, erosion, and biological resources. In fact, the

6 SEIR's project description was not complete until after the close of Draft SEIR comments, at
7 which point the Project applicant introduced a Vesting Tentative Map application to add up to
8 15 condominium units to the Project site. The SEIR also fails to adequately analyze the Project's

9 cumulative impacts.

10 5. For these and additional reasons described below, the City's approval of the
11 Project and certification of the SEIR constituted an unlawful abuse of discretion and must be
12 overturned.

13 PARTIES

14 6. Petitioner and Plaintiff Sierra Club is a non-profit corporation dedicated to
15 exploring, enjoying, and protecting the wild places of the earth; advocating for environmental
16 justice; practicing and promoting the responsible use of the earth's ecosystems and resources;
17 educating and encouraging humanity to protect and restore the quality of the natural and human
18 environment; and using all lawful means to carry out these objectives. Sierra Club's particular
19 interest in this case stems from the Sierra Club's local Loma Prieta Chapter's interests in
20 preserving the native, endangered, imperiled and sensitive species and wildlife habitats in Santa
21 Clara, San Mateo, and San Benito Counties. The members of the Loma Prieta Chapter live,
22 work, and recreate in and around the areas that will be directly affected by the Project. Sierra
23 Club submitted extensive comments to the City throughout its environmental review process for
24 the Project, which are part of the City's record of its decision to approve the Project and SEIR.
25 7. The interests that Sierra Club seeks to further in this action are within the goals
26 and purposes of this organization. Sierra Club and its members have a direct and beneficial
27 interest in the City's compliance with CEQA, its municipal code, and State Planning and Zoning
28 Law because those statutes and regulations are designed to protect the general public from
3
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Injunctive Relief
Case No.

1 environmental harms and impacts of unregulated business development. The interests of Sierra

2 Club and its members are and have been adversely and directly affected by the City's

3 certification of the SEIR for the Project and other project approvals, which violate state law as

4 set forth in this Petition and Complaint, and which could cause substantial and irreversible harm
5 to Sierra Club's members and the natural environment. Because the City certified a legally
6 inadequate SEIR in violation of CEQA's requirements, Sierra Club and its members were
7 deprived of complete information about the Project's potential environmental impacts and

8 measures to mitigate them. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a
substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public from the environmental, land use
10 planning, and other harms alleged herein, and by ensuring that the City abides by the procedures
11 required by law in its review of the Project.

12 8. Respondent and Defendant City of San Jose is, and at all times herein mentioned
13 was, a charter city in Santa Clara County, and is responsible for administering and carrying out
14 its own laws and applicable state laws, including but not limited to CEQA and State Planning
15 and Zoning Law, and its own municipal code. The City is the "lead agency" for the Project for
16 purposes of Public Resources Code section 21067, with principal responsibility for conducting a
17 proper review of the Project's environmental impacts. The City has a duty to comply with
18 CEQA and state law. The City, acting through its City Council, approved the Project.

19 9. Respondent and Defendant City Council of the City of San Jose is, and at all times
20 herein mentioned was, the duly elected legislative body of Respondent and Defendant City of
21 San Jose. As the City's decision-making body, the City Council is charged with responsibilities
22 under CEQA for conducting a proper review of the Project's environmental impacts, evaluating
23 mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid the Project's significant
24 environmental impacts, and otherwise complying with CEQA and the CEQA guidelines;
25 ensuring the Project's consistency with the City's General Plan under state Planning and Zoning
26 Law; compliance with the City's municipal code; and granting the various approvals necessary
27 for the Project.

Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Injunctive Relief
Case No.

1 10. Sierra Club is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents and
2 Defendants fictitiously named as Does 1 through 20 and sues such respondents by fictitious
3 names. Sierra Club is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the fictitiously
4 named respondents and defendants are also responsible for the actions described in this Petition
5 and Complaint. When the true identities and capacities of these respondents and defendants have

6 been determined, Sierra Club will amend this Petition and Complaint, with leave of the Court if

7 necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.

8 11. The Notice of Determination filed for the Project identifies the Project applicant as

9 "Boston Properties, Inc." Sierra Club thus names Boston Properties, Inc. as Real Parties in
10 Interest, pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5. Sierra Club is informed and
11 believes, and thereon alleges, that Boston Properties, Inc. is a Delaware Corporation. As the
12 Project applicant, Boston Properties, Inc. is a recipient of the approvals granted by the City as
13 part of the Project, and thus is a real party in interest within the meaning of Public Resources
14 Code section 21167.6.5.

15 12. Sierra Club is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that BXP Almaden
16 Associates LP is a subsidiary of Boston Properties, Inc. doing business in San Francisco,
17 California. BXP Almaden Associates LP is identified as the Project applicant in the Planning
18 Commission Staff Report. Sierra Club is further informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that
19 BXP Almaden Associates LP has an ownership interest in the property where the Project will be
20 located. Sierra Club thus names BXP Almaden LP as Real Parties in Interest.

21 13. Sierra Club is unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties fictitiously
22 named as Does 21 through 40 and sues such real parties by fictitious names. Sierra Club is
23 informed and believes, and on the basis of such information and belief alleges, that the
24 fictitiously named real parties are also directly and materially affected by the actions described
25 in this Petition and Complaint. When the true identities and capacities of these real parties have
26 been determined, Sierra Club will amend this Petition and Complaint, with leave of the Court if
27 necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.

3 Public Resources Code sections 21168.5 (alternatively section 21 168) and 21168.9, this Court
4 has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set aside Respondent's decision to certify the SEIR
5 and approve the Project.

6 15. Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of action alleged in this Petition

7 arose in Santa Clara County where the Project is located.

8 16. Sierra Club has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
9 21167.5 by serving a written notice of Sierra Club's intention to commence this action on the
10 City prior to filing this action. A copy of the written notice and proof of service is attached

11 hereto as Exhibit A.

12 17. Sierra Club has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
13 21167.6 by filing concurrently with this Petition a notice of Sierra Club's election to prepare the
14 record of administrative proceedings relating to this action.

15 18. Sierra Club has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
16 21167.7 by sending a copy of this Petition to the California Attorney General. A copy of the
17 letter transmitting this Petition is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

18 19. Sierra Club has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant
19 action and has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by
20 law..

21 20. Sierra Club has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
22 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require the City to set aside its approval
23  of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, the City's approval will remain in effect in
24 violation of state law.

25 21. This Petition is timely filed.

Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Injunctive Relief
Case No.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
2 Planning Framework

3 22. The General Plan, approved by the City in November 2011, sets the overall land

4 use and planning policies affecting development in the City. The General Plan emphasizes
5 protection of riparian habitats and biological resources. To that end, the General Plan contains
6 several policies explicitly intended to protect and preserve riparian habitats. These policies
7 include ER-2.2, which specifically requires a 100-foot setback from riparian habitat "in all but a

8 limited number of instances, only where no significant environmental impacts would occur."
9 23. Under General Plan Policy ER-2.1, the City must further "ensure that new public
10 and private development adjacent to riparian corridors in San Jose are consistent with the
11 provisions of the City's Riparian Corridor Policy Study and any adopted Santa Clara Valley
12 Habitat Conservation Plan/Natural Communities Conservation Plan." The City has not replaced
13 this General Plan policy.

14 24. The 1999 Riparian Corridor Policy Study ("Policy Study") establishes that
15 development adjacent to riparian habitats generally should be set back 100 feet from the outside
16 edge of the riparian habitat. While the Policy Study provides limited exceptions to this setback
17 requirement, including exceptions for locations in or near Downtown San Jose and urban infill
18 locations, the Policy Study states that these minimum reduced setbacks should be "no less than

19 30 feet or no less than the average of existing setbacks on adjacent properties, whichever is
20 greater." Minimum reduced setbacks for the limited redevelopment sites described under the
21 Policy Study's Setback Exceptions "should never be less than 30 feet."

22 25. Under General Plan action ER-2.6, the City is required to develop a Council
23 Policy based on the Policy Study to successfully implement the riparian goals and policies of the
24 General Plan.
25 26. The City Council Adopted Council Policy 6-34 on August 23, 2016 to provide
26 guidance consistent with the General Plan goals, policies, and actions for the protection of
27 riparian corridors and bird-safe design. Council Policy 6-34 provides guidance on how projects
28

7
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Injunctive Relief
Case No.

- should be designed to protect and preserve the City's riparian corridors, such as incorporating
2 "riparian setback recommendations and exceptions from the 1999 Policy Study."

3 27. Like the Policy Study, Council Policy 6-34 requires a minimum 100-foot setback
4 from riparian habitats for new buildings in existing urban infill areas,

5 new residential buildings,
as well as commercial/institutional buildings. Rather than provide a specific limitation on

6 reduced setbacks, Council Policy 6-34 relies on the Policy Study for additional standards.
7 According to Council Policy 6-34, the setback and buffer widths provided in Council Policy 6-
8 34 "are intended to provide general guidance for site design. For actual setback and buffer
9 dimensions, the specific setbacks section in Chapter 3 of the Policy Study should be consulted."

10 28.

11 Council Policy 6-34 also specifies bird-safe design guidelines for riparian projects
in the City. Pursuant to these guidelines, design of buildings and structures should avoid mirrors
12 and large areas of reflective glass, use materials and lighting to reduce light and glare impacts,
13 and avoid funneling open space to a building façade.
14 The Project Area - Affected Environment
15 29. The Guadalupe River, located in downtown San Jose, is a Category stream as
16 defined by the Santa Clara Valley Habitat Conservation Plan/Natural Communities
17 Conservation Plan ("HCP/NCCP"). According to the Habitat Conservation Plan, the stream type
18 has sufficient flow to support sensitive species and riparian habitat.

19 30. The Guadalupe River Corridor comprises a series of habitat patches a in a linear
20 continuum of concrete channels, underpasses and tunnels, modified creek channels, and some
21 unmodified stretches. Both modified and unmodified creek channels retain habitat quality where
22 riparian trees and vegetation are present. Unmodified stretches with diverse community of
23 riparian trees have the highest value.
24 31. Numerous species are dependent on the Guadalupe River and its riparian corridor.
25 Notably, the Guadalupe River sustains a healthy and mature riparian forest, with a large a
26 assembly of native tree species, including: Coast live oak, Red willow, Fremont cottonwood,
27 Valley oak, Box elder, California bay, Western sycamore and California buckeye. This diverse
28
8
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Injunctive Relief
Case No.

riparian forest supports the amphibian, reptile, and butterfly species known to inhabit the
2 Guadalupe River corridor near the Project site.

3 32. Additionally, the Guadalupe River is essential for migration and movement of

4 native resident and migratory fish and other aquatic species. Native fish, such as the Central
California Coast steelhead, a species listed under the federal Endangered Species Act, and

6 Central Valley Fall-run Chinook salmon are known to spawn, and other special status fish such

7 as Pacific lamprey, green sturgeon, and longfin smelt are known to occur, in the Guadalupe
8 River watershed.

9 33. Over 95 avian species are known to utilize the portion of the Guadalupe River
10 bordering the Project site. Several of these are migratory species associated with riparian
11 habitats, including: Pacific-slope Flycatcher, Tree Swallow, Hooded Oriole, Bullock's Oriole,
12 Orange-crowned Warbler, Yellow Warbler, Yellow-rumped Warbler, Townsend's Warbler,
13 Wilson's Warbler, and Western Tanager. Additionally, the Guadalupe River's riparian corridor
14 adjacent to the Project site is home to several avian families: five species of Woodpeckers, four
15 species of Hawks, two species of Falcons, four species of Flycatchers, two species of Vireos,
16 three species of Thrushes, five species of Swallows, five species of Finches, and eight species of
17 Sparrows.
18 The Project

19 34. The 3.57-acre Project site is a public surface parking lot. The site is surrounded by
20 the San Jose Convention Center to the east across South Almaden Boulevard, a 9-story office
21 building to the north, single-family residences approved for redevelopment with two office
22 towers to the south, and the Guadalupe River and Trail to the west.

23 35. The site is long and narrowly shaped with an approximately 0.16-mile stretch of
24 the Guadalupe River riparian corridor along the entire western edge. The 12-foot wide
25 Guadalupe River Trail is immediately adjacent to the west of the site.
26 36. The Project would demolish the existing parking lot and construct an
27 approximately 2.05 million square foot building that includes approximately 1,416,717 square
28 feet of office space in two 16-story, 823-foot high towers connected by a podium, approximately

Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Injunctive Relief
Case No.

37,603 square feet of amenity and retail space on the ground floor podium, and three levels of

2 underground parking.
37. The Project setback from the Guadalupe River would be between zero and
4 approximately 24 feet from the riparian corridor along the length of the site and would encroach

5 within approximately 1.8 acres of the 100-foot setback area. The Project towers' upper floors

6 would have a setback ranging from 3.92 feet to 32.5 feet to the edge of the riparian corridor and

7 the underground parking garage would have a setback ranging from 1.5 feet to 34.25 feet to the

8 edge of the riparian corridor.
9 Environmental Review of the Project

10 38. The Project will take place within a developed urban area subject to the

11 Downtown Strategy 2040 development zone. The analysis in the SEIR tiers from the Downtown
12 Strategy 2040 Final Environmental Impact Report ("Downtown Strategy FEIR").

13 39. The City issued a Notice of Preparation ("NOP") of an SEIR on May 25, 2019.
14 Sierra Club, along with the Santa Clara Valley Audubon Society, California Native Plant
15 Society, and other environmental non-profit organizations, submitted comments on the NOP,
16 and requested preliminary landscape and storm water plans to understand the impacts of the
17 project on the riparian corridor. Sierra Club further requested in-depth descriptions of the stream
18 aquatic and riparian ecosystem baseline conditions to better understand the existing biological

19 resources along the Project side adjacent to the Guadalupe River. Sierra Club also expressed
20 concern regarding the cumulative impacts given the many projects in San Jose under
21 construction or in development review.

22 40. The City prepared and released the Draft SEIR on July 31, 2020, for a 45-day
23 public review period that ended on September 14, 2020. The SEIR identified scores of
24 potentially significant impacts, including impacts to biological resources and air quality. The
25 Draft SEIR concluded that the Project would result in a number of significant and unavoidable
26 impacts, even with the proposed mitigation.
27

28
10
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Injunctive Relief
Case No.

41. Sierra Club, along with several environmental organizations and local agencies,
2 commented on the Draft SEIR. Many of these comments focused on the Project's impacts to
3 biological resources, the adjacent riparian habitat, and water quality concerns.

4 42. For example, California Native Plant Society and the Guadalupe-Coyote Resource
5 Conservation District both noted that the Project's setback of less than 30 feet violated General
6 Plan policies ER-2.1 and 2.2, as well as Council Policy 6-34 and the Policy Study. California

7 Native Plant Society also raised concerns regarding the Project's violation with the City's bird-
8 safe design policies in Council Policy 6-34.
9 43. Commenters also noted that the SEIR does not include a feasible riparian corridor
10 mitigation plan for cumulative impacts to water supply, hydrology, water quality, and biological
11 resources due to the additional development projects the City had recently approved.
12 44. The City released the Final SEIR in August 2021. The Final SEIR provided no
13 substantive revisions to address the specific and detailed concerns regarding the Draft SEIR.
14 45. In response to the Final SEIR, Sierra Club was joined by other environmental
15 groups in condemning the City's analysis. Specifically, Sierra Club reiterated that approval of
16 the Project would violate the City's Riparian setback requirements and the General Plan because
17 the Project proposes a setback less than 30 feet. As Sierra Club explained in its letter, Council
18 Policy 6-34 may allow exceptions to the 100-foot setback standard mandated by the General
19 Plan, but Council Policy 6-34 and the Policy Study are both clear that no setback may be less
20 than 30 feet.

21 46. Additionally, Sierra Club commented on the Project's violation of San Jose
22 Municipal Code. Under San Jose Municipal Code, issuance of a Special Use Permit must be
23 consistent with city council policies and the General Plan. According to Sierra Club, the
24 Project's setback is in violation of both City Council Policy 6-34 and General Plan policies
25 regarding riparian setback requirements, thus issuance of a Special Use Permit violates the
26 City's own ordinances.
27 47. Sierra Club also expressed concern regarding the Project's CEQA review. For
28 example, Sierra Club decried the SEIR's flawed project description and the sudden change in
11
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Injunctive Relief
Case No.

the Project due to the newly introduced condominiums and continuously shifting setback

2 dimensions.

48. Sierra Club also commented on the SEIR's inadequate mitigation for Project
4 impacts to land use, riparian habitats, hydrology, and water quality, as well as the SEIR's

5 incomplete cumulative impact analysis to biological resources. For example, because the Project
6 would not have an adequate setback from the riparian area, the riverbank will need to be
7 hardscaped to protect the proposed Project from flooding and erosion. Managing flood risk in

8 this way would further exacerbate erosion and sedimentation in the Guadalupe River, harming

9 water quality and aquatic habitat downstream. As Sierra Club noted, however, the SEIR fails to
10 evaluate these impacts or mitigation necessary to avoid them.

11 49. Additionally, Sierra Club criticized the City's unlawful rejection of the
12 environmentally superior, Reduced Development Alternative.

13 50. The City Council held a public hearing to consider the Project and the SEIR on
14 September 14, 2021. At the meeting, the City Council passed a resolution certifying the SEIR;
15 approving CEQA Findings; adopting a Statement of Overriding Considerations and Mitigation
16 Monitoring and Reporting Program. City Council also passed two resolutions approving the
17 Vesting Tentative Map, and approving the Project's Special Use Permit.
18 51: The City's adopted findings concluded that some of the Project's significant
19 impacts would not be reduced to less than significant levels despite the application of mitigation
20 measures.

21 52. On September 16, 2021 the Santa Clara County Clerk filed a Notice of
22 Determination ("NOD") for the Project.

23 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

24 Violation of Planning and Zoning Law

26 53. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs

27 in their entirety.

28
12
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Injunctive Relief
Case No.

1 54. Government Code section 65300 requires the legislative body of each city to adopt
2 a general plan for the physical development of the city. The general plan serves as a charter for
3 future development to which all other land use decisions must conform.

4 55. Because the general plan is the constitution for all future development in a city,

5 any decision of the city affecting land use and development must be consistent with the general

6 plan. Resource Defense Fund v. County of Santa Cruz (1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 800, 806;
7 Families Unafraid to Uphold Rural El Dorado County v. Board of Supervisors (1998) 62
8 Cal.App.4th 1332, 1336. It is an abuse of discretion to approve a project that "frustrate[s] the
9 General Plan's goals and policies." Napa 99 Citizens for Honest Gov. V. Napa County (2001) 91
10 Cal.App.4th 342, 379. A project need not present an "outright conflict" with a general plan
11 provision to be considered inconsistent; the determining question is instead whether the project
12 "is compatible with and will not frustrate the General Plan's goals and policies." Napa Citizens,
13 91 Cal.App.4th at 379.

14 56. The City violated the requirements of state law by approving a project that is
15 directly inconsistent with the requirements of the City's General Plan.
16 57. General Plan Policy ER-2.2 requires a 100-foot setback from riparian habitat "in
17 all but a limited number of instances, only where no significant environmental impacts would
18 occur." The Project is not setback 100 feet from the Guadalupe River riparian corridor.
19 Moreover, the SEIR concludes that encroachment of the Project within the 100-foot setback
20 would result in significant unavoidable impacts to adjacent riparian communities, including
21 reduction of wildlife habitat shading, and expected bird collisions. The Project's setback
22 reduction plainly violates General Plan Policy ER-2.2.
23 58. General Plan Policy ER-2.1 requires development to be "consistent with the
24 provisions of the City's Riparian Corridor Policy Study and any adopted Santa Clara Valley
25 Habitat Conservation Plan/Natural Communities Conservation Plan." The Policy Study also
26 establishes that development adjacent to riparian habitats generally should be set back 100 feet
27 from the outside edge of the riparian habitat. While the Policy Study provides limited exceptions
28 to this minimum setback, including exceptions for locations in or near Downtown San Jose and
13
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Injunctive Relief
Case No,

1 urban infill locations, the Policy Study is clear that these minimum reduced setbacks should

2 never be less than 30 feet. The Project setback would be between zero and approximately 24 feet
3 from the riparian corridor along the length of the site and would encroach within approximately

4 1.8-acres of the 100-foot setback area. As such, the Project's setbacks would violate the Policy
5 Study by allowing development within 30 feet from riparian habitats.

6 59. a As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
7 discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law by approving the Project and
8 making findings that do not comply with the City's General Plan and State Planning and Zoning
9 Law. As such, the approval of the Project must be set aside.

10 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

11 Violation of San Jose Municipal Code

12 (San Jose Municipal Code § 20100.820)

13 60. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs
14 in their entirety.

15 61: All land use approvals must comply with the City's own ordinances. Robinson v.
16 City of Oakland (1968) 268 Cal.App.2d 269, 274.

17 62. a As a prerequisite to receiving a Special Use Permit for any project, the City's
18 Municipal Code section 20100.820(A)(1) requires a finding that the permit is "consistent with
19 and will further the policies of the general plan." Under Municipal Code section
20 20100.820(A)(3), the Special Use Permit must also be "consistent with applicable city council
21 policies." Any such findings have to be substantiated or the decision-making body shall deny the
22 application.

23 63. The City did not make the findings necessary to support approval of the Project's
24| Special Use Permit.
......... 25 64. The Project's setbacks violate General Plan policies ER-2.1 and ER-2.2 by
26 allowing development within 30 feet from riparian habitats and ignoring the General Plan's
27 prohibition of setbacks less than 100 feet when significant environmental harm will result. The
28 SEIR states that the Project will generate substantial environmental impacts, including
14
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Injunctive Relief
Case No.

1 significant, unmitigated impacts to the adjacent riparian habitat and bird species from noise,
2 pollution, increased traffic, and construction. As such, the Project is inconsistent with the

3 General Plan. The City's approval of the Special Use Permit violates Municipal Code section
4 20100.820(A)(1).

5 65. The Project is also not consistent with Council Policy 6-34. For instance, Council

6 Policy 6-34 requires a minimum 100-foot setback from riparian habitats for new buildings in
7 existing urban infill areas, new residential buildings, as well as commercial/institutional
8 buildings. Council Policy 6-34 offers enumerated exceptions to the 100-foot setback standard.
9 However, rather than provide specific limitation on reduced setbacks, Council Policy 6-34
10 directs agencies to the Policy Study for actual setback dimensions. The Policy Study is clear that
11 a setback cannot be reduced to less than 30 feet under any circumstances. The Project setback
12 would be between zero and approximately 24 feet from the riparian corridor along the length of
13 the site and would encroach within approximately 1.8-acres of the 100-foot setback area. As
14 such, the Project violates Council Policy 6-34. The City's approval of the Special Use Permit
15 violates Municipal Code section 20100.820(A)(3).
16 66. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
17 discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law by approving the Project and
18 making findings that do not comply with City's Municipal Code. As such, the approval of the
19 Project and the Project's Special Use Permit must be set aside.
20 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

21 Violation of CEQA
22 (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.; CEQA Guidelines;
23 CCP §§ 1085, 1094.5)
24 67. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs
25 in their entirety.
26 68. CEQA is designed to ensure that the long-term protection of the environment is
27 the guiding criterion in discretionary public decisions. CEQA accomplishes its purpose by
28 requiring the lead agency of a project with the potential to cause significant environmental
15
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Injunctive Relief
Case No.

- impacts to prepare an EIR that complies with the requirements of the statute, including, but not
2 limited to, the requirement to analyze the project's potentially significant environmental

3 impacts. The EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such that the decisionmakers
4 can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on the proposed project.
5 Such analysis must include and rely upon thresholds of significance that are based on substantial
6 evidence in the record.

7 69. Additionally, the EIR must identify feasible mitigation measures to reduce or
8 avoid the project's significant environmental impacts, as well as analyze a reasonable range of
9 alternatives to the project. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency adopt all feasible
10 mitigation measures that would reduce or avoid any of the project's significant environmental
11 impacts. If any of the project's significant impacts cannot be mitigated to a less-than-significant
12 level, then CEQA bars the lead agency from approving a project if a feasible alternative is

13 available that would meet the project's objectives while avoiding or reducing its significant
14 environmental impacts.

15 70. CEQA further mandates that a lead agency may approve a project that would have
16 significant, unavoidable environmental impacts only if the agency finds that the project's
17 benefits would outweigh its unavoidable impacts.

18 71. Under CEQA, all the findings required for an agency's approval of a project must
19 be legally adequate and supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. State law
20 further requires that an agency provide an explanation of how the evidence in the record
21 supports the conclusions the agency has reached.
22 72. The City's approval of the Project constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion in
23 that the City failed to proceed in the manner required by law and failed to act on the basis of
24 substantial evidence. The SEIR's deficiencies include, but are not limited to, the following:

25 73. The SEIR fäils to provide a complete and legally adequate project description. The
26 description of the Project is unstable because it has continually shifted since the start of the
27 CEQA process. The Project setbacks from various boundaries have changed at least three times.
28 Additionally, the size and square footage of the Project has repeatedly shifted throughout the
16
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Injunctive Relief
Case No.

environmental review process. As a result, the SEIR failed to adequately inform the public of

2 the actual planned size of the Project. Moreover, the SEIR omits information, even at the
3 conceptual level, including, but not limited to, biological setting; baseline understanding of
4 Il contaminated soil and groundwater; hours of construction, noise and vibration minimization

5 measures.

6 74. The SEIR fails to adequately analyze the significant adverse environmental effects
7 of the Project, including but not limited to, the following:

8 a. Land Use. The SEIR fails to properly disclose and evaluate the Project's
9 inconsistency with the General Plan.

10 b. Biological Resources.

11 i. The SEIR mischaracterizes the existing setting of the Project site and
12 adjacent Riparian Habitat. The SEIR fails to present important contextual information related to
13 the biological value of the Guadalupe River riparian corridor. Because the SEIR erroneously
14 characterizes the riparian habitat as degraded, the SEIR's evaluation of the Project's impacts on
15 biological resources falsely concludes that these impacts would be less-than-significant.

16 ii. The SEIR fails to disclose the extent and severity of impacts to
17 biological resources resulting from the Project's shading, glare, and heat impacts. For example,
18 the SEIR did not analyze the impact of glare from the sun reflected off of the Project's building
19 facades into adjacent riparian habitats. As a result of this glare, adjacent riparian habitat and
20| biological resources will experience increased heat and intensified ultra-violet radiation.
21 However, these impacts are neither disclosed nor analyzed in the SEIR.
22 iii. The SEIR fails to adequately evaluate the Project's adverse indirect
23 impacts on downstream habitat areas. The SEIR discloses that native fish, such as the Central
24 California Coast steelhead and Central Valley Fall-run Chinook salmon are known to spawn,
25 and special status fish such as Pacific Lamprey, green sturgeon, and longfin smelt may occur, in
26 the Guadalupe River watershed. Yet, the SEIR inexplicably omits analysis of the Project's
27 potential impacts on downstream habitats.

28

17
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Injunctive Relief
Case No.

iv. The SEIR inadequately discloses impacts related to bird collisions
2 with the Project. The SEIR identifies and evaluates only three of the building facades as
3 potentially impacting birds. However, bird collisions in structures adjacent to riparian habitat are

4 common on all facades of a building, regardless of their orientation relative to riparian areas.

C. Hydrology and Water Quality Impacts.
i. The Initial Study fails to address Project-related impacts related to
7 hydrology, water quality, and erosion as a result of a series of errors, including: (1) the failure to

8 consider applicable guidance regarding development in floodplains; (2) the failure to disclose
9 the extent and severity of impacts related to erosion and sedimentation; (3) the failure to identify
10 feasible mitigation measures.

11 ii. The SEIR fails to disclose the extent and severity of foreseeable
12 impacts related to erosion and sedimentation. Given that the Project would not have an adequate
13 setback from the riparian area, it is foreseeable that the riverbank next to the Projects site would
14 need to be hardscaped to protect the proposed building from flood risks. A hardscape solution
15 would require removal of the riparian vegetation for construction. This would lead to increased.
16 erosion upstream and downstream of the site. Managing flood risk in this way would further
17 exacerbate sedimentation in the Guadalupe River, harming water quality and aquatic habitat.
18 Sedimentation would consequently harm sensitive species that utilize the habitat, such as

19 Central California Coast steelhead, Central Valley Fall-run Chinook salmon, Pacific lamprey,
20 green sturgeon, and longfin smelt. SEIR fails to evaluate these impacts.

21 75. The SEIR relies on mitigation measures without evidence that such measures will
22 be effective or feasible or that they will adequately compensate for the significant adverse
23 environmental impacts caused by the Project. The SEIR must set forth specific mitigation
24 measures or set forth performance standards that such measures would be achieved by various,
25 specified approaches. See CEQA Guidelines § 15126.4. Moreover, CEQA forbids deleting or
26 modifying previously-adopted mitigation measures. Katzeff v. California Dept. of Forestry and
27 Fire Protection (2010) 181 Cal.App.4th 601, 611. If an agency pursues modification of
28 mitigation, it must conduct additional environmental review to evaluate the environmental
18
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Injunctive Relief
Case No.

impacts of changing its mitigation. Lincoln Place Tenants Assn. V. City of Los Angeles (2005)
2 130 Cal.App.4th 1491, 1509. Examples of the inadequate analysis of mitigation measures
3 include, but are not limited to:

4 a. Biological Resources.

5 i. The SEIR does not comply with the Downtown Strategy 2040

6 FEIR's proposed mitigation for riparian habitats, nor does the SEIR comply with mitigation
measures adopted in the City's General Plan EIR to protect riparian habitats. The SEIR tiers and
relies on the proffered mitigation from the Downtown Strategy 2040 FEIR. The Downtown

9 Strategy 2040 FEIR assumes compliance with General Plan policies ER-2.1 and ER-2.2 and
10 requires compliance with these policies and Council Policy 6-34 to mitigate adverse
11 environmental impacts. The General Plan EIR similarly requires compliance with the Policy
12 Study to mitigate program-level impacts to fish and wildlife movement as well as sensitive
13 communities and habitats within the City. The Project does not conform with General Plan
14| policies ER-2.1, ER-2.2, nor does the Project comply with either Council Policy 6-34 or the
15 Policy Study. Because the Project fails to comply with mandatory mitigation requirements in
16 both the Downtown Strategy 2040 FEIR and the General Plan EIR, the City cannot rely on that
17 document to justify its conclusion that development of the Project will not result in significant
18 project-specific impacts to riparian corridors.
19 ii. Mitigation Measure BIO (C)-1.2 has not been shown to be feasible
20 to mitigate impacts to biological resources and riparian habitats. Restoration of the riparian
21 habitat on-site would require approval from the Water District, which does not typically allow
22 private parties to implement such mitigation.

23 iii. Mitigation Measure BIO-1.1 is not adequate to mitigate impacts
24 related to bird collisions. The measure limits application of certain elements only to portions of
25 the building at certain heights. Bird collisions can occur at any building height and on all
26 building facades, including on the podium portion of the building.
27 b. Hydrology and Water Quality Impacts. The Project's Initial Study and
28 SEIR impermissibly relies on compliance with existing regulations to mitigate significant
19
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Injunctive Relief
Case No.

impacts related to hydrology and water quality. For example, the Initial Study implies that state

2 regulations requiring review and oversight of the erosion control system by the Regional Water
3 Board will ensure that potential impacts will be avoided or mitigated. The SEIR also states that
4 the Project would comply with City's Post-Construction Urban Runoff Policy 6-29 and
5 Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program to reduce stormwater runoff from the Project.
6 Yet, the SEIR fails to describe how the Project will comply with the applicable regulations.

7 76. The SEIR fails to adequately analyze the Project's cumulative impacts. A legally
8 adequate cumulative impacts analysis views a particular project over time and in conjunction
9 with other related past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future projects whose impacts might
10 compound or interrelate with those of the project at hand. The SEIR's cumulative impact
11 analysis violates CEQA because it fails to: (1) provide information on the extent and severity of
12 cumulative impacts to riparian areas from nearby development; and (2) evaluate the cumulative
13 impacts from the Project's shading of riparian habitat areas in combination with the two 20-
14 story, 297-foot office towers with a total building area of approximately 1.8 million square feet
15 planned to the south of the Project site.

16 77. The SEIR fails to adequately analyze alternatives to the Project. The SEIR does
17 not comply with the requirements of CEQA because it fails to undertake a legally sufficient
18 study of alternatives to the Project and fails to consider feasible alternatives that would
19 substantially reduce these Project impacts. The SEIR fails to consider any alternative that is
20 consistent with the City's setback requirements as set forth in the Policy Study, Council Policy
21 6-34, and the General Plan.

22 78. The SEIR summarily rejects alternatives to the Project, asserting that particular
23 alternatives are infeasible because they do not eliminate significant unavoidable impacts or do
24| not achieve Project objectives. CEQA does not require that impacts be eliminated for adoption
25 of an alternative, but rather that they be reduced. Pub. Res. Code § 21002. CEQA requires
26 agencies to explain their rejection of potentially feasible alternatives in a manner "sufficient to
27 enable meaningful public participation and criticism." Save Round Valley Alliance v. County of
28 Inyo (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 1437, 1458. The Planning Commission here rejected the Reduced
20
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Injunctive Relief
Case No.

- Development Alternative (Option 1) following staff's recommendation to deny it because "this
2 alternative would not meet one of the project objectives, which is to maximize the use of an

3 underutilized infill site compared to the Project." Maximizing the use of infill sites requires
4 taking account of regulatory constraints. The Reduced Development Alternative does maximize
5 infill sites because it is more consistent with legal development limits established by the City's

6 setback requirements.

7 79. CEQA mandates selection of the environmentally superior alternative if it can

8 feasibly attain most of a project's objectives, "even if it would impede to some degree the

0 attainment of the project objectives, or would be more costly." CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6(b).
10 The Reduced Development Alternative is the environmentally superior alternative and it clearly
11 satisfies the majority of the project objectives without impacting the riparian corridor to the
12 same degree as the Project.
13 80. The SEIR failed to adequately respond to comments submitted on the Draft SEIR.
14 The Final SEIR's response to comments failed to provide the good faith, reasoned analysis
15 required by CEQA, instead providing conclusory statements unsupported by factual information.
16 81. The City violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter of
17 law in that they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

18 82. The City violated CEQA by adopting a statement of overriding considerations that
19 is inadequate as a matter of law in that it is not supported by substantial evidence in the record.
20 83. As a result of the foregoing defects, the City prejudicially abused its discretion and
21 failed to proceed in the manner required by law by certifying an SEIR, making findings, and
22 taking related actions that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA. As such, the City's
23 certification of the SEIR and approval of the Project must be set aside.
24 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

25 WHEREFORE, Sierra Club prays for judgment as follows:
26 1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the City to vacate and
27 set aside its certification of the SEIR and approval of the Project;
28
21
Petition For Writ Of Mandate And Complaint For Injunctive Relief
Case No.

2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the City to comply with
2 CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines and to take any other action required by Public Resources

3 Code section 21168.9;

4 3. For a temporary stay, a temporary restraining order, and preliminary and

5 permanent injunctions restraining Respondents, Real Party in Interest, and their agents, servants,

6 and employees, and all others acting in concert with Respondents or on their behalf from issuing

7 any grading, building, or other permits or approvals, permitting or undertaking any construction,

8 or taking any other action to implement in any way the Project, including pursuing applications
9 for approvals for the Project, pending full compliance with the requirements of CEQA and the
10 CEQA Guidelines, State Planning and Zoning Law, and the San Jose Municipal Code;
1-1 4. For costs of the suit;

12 5. For attorneys' fees as authorized by Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and
13 any other provision of law; and

14 6. For such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.
