18 INTRODUCTION

19 Petitioners Preserving the Peace and Taxpayers for MPUSD Accountability

20 allege as follows:

21 1 . This action challenges the July 27, 2021 actions of the Monterey

22 Peninsula Unified School District (MPUSD) board of trustees to certify an environmental

23 impact report and approve MPUSD's $15 million project to construct a million+ dollar

24 football stadium lighting system, a costly public address system, aluminum bleachers

25 with 300 seats for visiting team fans and other new construction at the historic Carmel

26 stone stadium and to construct a new multi-sport field at Monterey High School

27 ("Stadium and Field Project"). The EIR admits that the Stadium and Field Project would

28 have significant and unavoidable noise and lighting impacts on the surrounding

1
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 residential neighborhoods. Other unmitigated impacts include traffic safety, parking,

2 historic resources, and more. The MPUSD decision to approve the unnecessary project

3 offends the publicized intent of MPUSD's Measure I, the June 2018 bond measure that

4 was promoted as being necessary in order to "fix our crumbling schools." The Stadium

5 and Field Project is the biggest project at Monterey High School to be funded by

6 Measure I, and the Stadium and Field Project does not include a single improvement

7 that is identified as a "facilities need" on the Master Plan for Monterey High School that

8 the MPUSD board adopted in January 2018 as the basis for the June 2018 Measure l.

9 2. MPUSD seeks to shoehorn controversial new non-classroom facilities into

10 the school and the neighborhood that were not on the list of needs in the MPUSD

11 Master Plan for the high school. The introduction of 70-foot lights, a public address

12 system, visitors bleachers, and other spectator-oriented facilities to the stadium would

13 cause new impacts. By its four 70-foot-foot tall stadium field lighting structures and

14 public address system and adverse impacts to historic resources, MPUSD also seeks to

15 violate the local government and community's zoning, general plan regulations and land

16 use controls which were enacted to ensure development uniformity, compatibility, and

17 ensure that residential neighborhoods and public assets and resources are being

18 protected and not adversely impacted.

19 3. This action challenges the decision by MPUSD to certify an environmental

20 impact report and to approve the Stadium and Field Project that would add a public

21 address system and lights to facilitate spectator-oriented events at the athletic stadium,,

22 and to avoid the review by the City of Monterey of the stadium lights, PA system, and

23 other nonclassroom facilities. This action also challenges the related actions by

24 MPUSD to avoid prior CEQA review for the Parking Project to which MPUSD has
25 committed under CEQA to and has started to construct despite unmitigated impacts on

26 historic resources. This action also challenges the related actions by MPUSD to avoid

27 prior CEQA review for the Logan Lane Driveway Widening Project to which MPUSD has

28

21CV002755

1 committed under CEQA. MPUSD is the lead agency under CEQA for the Stadium and

2 Field Project, the Parking Project, and the Logan Lane Driveway Widening Project.

3 PARTIES

4 4. Petitioner and plaintiff PRESERVING THE PEACE is an unincorporated

5 association under California law. Its members and supporters are interested in the

6 upholding of environmental laws, the processes and transparency of governmental land

7 use actions, and the preserving of the peace and the quiet enjoyment that the area has

8 historically enjoyed, and they are beneficially interested in the outcome of this action.

9 Its members and supporters include residents who reside within the boundaries and

10 taxpayers of the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District. The decisions of MPUSD,

11 if allowed to stand, will have detrimental impacts on Preserving the Peace, its members

12 and supporters, and members of public who work nearby and who reside in and around

13 the project site. Its members include persons who participated in the public process

14 before MPUSD and commented in person and through its representatives in writing

15 and/or verbally. Preserving the Peace has standing to pursue this action.
16 5. Petitioner and plaintiff TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY

17 (Taxpayers) is an unincorporated association under California law. Its members and

18 supporters reside within the boundaries of the Monterey Peninsula Unified School

19 District, are residents and taxpayers within said geographical area of the District and

20 have paid taxes within at least the last fiscal and calendar tax years. Taxpayers and its

21 members participated and voted in the general election pertaining to Measure I. Its
22 members united for the purpose to monitor and ensure that laws are faithfully and fully
23 complied with during the planning, implementation and spending of school bond money,

24 promoting quality educational facilities, while at the same time protecting the

25 environment including traffic safety and ensuring strict and good faith compliance with

26 the laws, regulations and ordinances adopted to protect the same. Taxpayers has

27 standing to enforce such laws regarding the development projects at issue in this

21CV002755

1 The decisions of MPUSD, if allowed to stand, will have detrimental impacts on

2 Taxpayers, its members, and the general public who own businesses adjacent to the

3 project construction route, and who drive past it, and who are anywhere within hearing

4 distance of the public address system and other event related noise, and within sight of

5 the lights, the skyglow caused by the lights, and other lighting impacts. Taxpayers'

6 members include those who use, visit and pay for the subject facilities. Taxpayers'

7 members and representatives protested against respondents' actions preceding the

8 filing of this petition and complaint. Taxpayers and its members participated in the

9 administrative proceedings below by providing written comments to respondent,

10 speaking to the school board, making oral and written comments, and have participated

11 in the public hearings or have otherwise raised some or all the legal deficiencies

12 asserted in this initial pleading. Taxpayers has standing to pursue this action.
13 6. Respondent and Defendant MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL

14 DISTRICT (MPUSD) is a public school district incorporated under the laws of the state

15 of California and it is charged with complying with applicable provisions of state law,

16 including the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), the California Government

17 Code and the other general laws of this State, the California Constitution, and the plans,

18 codes and regulations of the City of Monterey. Under California Government Code

19 section 53091 the District is required to comply with city zoning ordinances and general

20 and community plans. MPUSD through its board of trustees and its administration

21 made the actions complained of in this action, and is otherwise responsible for all

22 actions and conduct which is the subject of this litigation. MPUSD is lead agency and

23 project proponent of the Stadium and Field Project, the Parking Project, the Logan Lane

24 Driveway Widening Project, and the science building project at issue in this action.

25 7. Respondent and Defendant MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL

26 DISTRICT BOARD OF TRUSTEES is the legislative and decision making body for the

27 school district and is charged with the duty of ensuring, among other things, that all

28 applicable federal, state and local laws are fully and faithfully obeyed and implemented.

1 It is composed of seven elected directors from three different geographical divisions.

2 The board of trustees took several of the actions giving rise to this action.

3 8. Petitioners and plaintiffs Preserving the Peace and Taxpayers for MPUSD

4 Accountability (collectively, "Petitioners") are ignorant of the true names and capacities

5 of the respondents and defendants sued herein as DOES 1 to 100 and therefore sues 1

6 these defendants by such fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this complaint to

7 allege their true names and capacities when ascertained. Petitioners designate all

8 persons unknown claiming any interests in the Project as DOE respondents/defendants.

9 TIMING, VENUE and JURISDICTION, EXHAUSTION

10 9. This lawsuit has been commenced within the time limits imposed for

11 actions under the California Code of Civil Procedure and California Public Resources

12 Code, as made applicable to the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District by its own

13 policies, regulations, or by the general laws of this State. MPUSD did not file a notice of

14 exemption or other CEQA notice for its Logan Lane Driveway Widening Project in April

15 2021 or for its Parking Project approvals in June 2021. This action is timely filed as to

16 those matters. On July 28, 2021 the MPUSD filed a notice of determination for the

17 Stadium and Field Project approvals and this action is being filed within 30 days of that

18 filing. The notice did not identify any real parties in interest or applicants.

19 10. Venue and jurisdiction in this Court are proper pursuant to the California

20 Code of Civil Procedure for a matter relating to subject property located within, and
21 administrative action decided within, the Court's geographical venue jurisdiction.

22 11. Petitioners have exhausted, or been excused from, all administrative
23 remedies reasonably and legally available to Petitioner under the applicable laws.

24 NOTICE

25 12. Petitioners have repeatedly offered to meet with respondents to try to

26 resolve the disputes. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to filing this

27 action by complying with all requirements of the California Public Resources Code,

28 including giving written notice on August 25, 2021 to Respondent of this action prior to

5
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 filing this action. The proof of service of that written notice is attached to this verified

2 petition as Exhibit A.. Petitioners have no other remedy than to bring this action.

3 13. Notice will be provided promptly to the California Attorney General of this

4 action promptly after it is filed.

5 14. Respondent has already constructed part of the Parking Project at issue in

6 this action and has stated its intention to proceed with construction of the Stadium and

7 Field Project within the immediate near future which might occur during the pendency

8 and before this action can and might be decided by this Court. Construction of the

9 public address system, stadium lighting and other elements of the Stadium and Field

10 Project and the Logan Lane Widening Project before this case is decided will cause

11 irreparable harm. Injunctive relief may be sought to restrain MPUSD from proceeding

12 with the projects at issue

13 LEGAL, FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

14 GIVING RISE TO THIS ACTION.

15 15. Under the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources Code,

16 § 21000 et seq.), a public agency must prepare an environmental impact report (EIR) on

17 any project the agency proposes to "carry out or approve" if that project may have

18 significant environmental effects (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21100, subd. (a), 21151,

19 subd. (a).) The EIR must describe the proposed project and its environmental setting,

20 state the objectives sought to be achieved, identify and analyze the significant effects

21 on the environment, state how those impacts can be mitigated or avoided, and identify

22 and analyze alternatives to the project. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21100, subd. (b),
23 21151; CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15124, 15125, 15126.6.) The California Supreme Court

24 has emphasized the significance of the environmental impact report:

25 The preparation and circulation of an EIR is more than a set

26 of technical hurdles for agencies and developers to

27 overcome. The EIR's function is to ensure that government
officials who decide to build or approve a project do so with a
28 full understanding of the environmental consequences and,

6
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 equally important, that the public is assured those

2 consequences have been taken into account. For the EIR to
serve these goals it must present information in such a
3 manner that the foreseeable impacts of pursuing the project
4 can actually be understood and weighed, and the public

5 must be given an adequate opportunity to comment on that
presentation before the decision to go forward is made.

7 (Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth V. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40

8 Cal.4th 412, 449-450, internal citation omitted.)

9 7. The Sixth District Court of Appeal summarized the key principles in Save

10 Our Peninsula Committee v. Monterey County Board of Supervisors (2001) 87

11 Cal.App.4th 99:

12 the overriding purpose of CEQA is to ensure that agencies
regulating activities that may affect the quality of the
13 environment give primary consideration to preventing
14 environmental damage. CEQA is the Legislature's

15 declaration of policy that all necessary action be taken to
protect, rehabilitate, and enhance the environmental quality
16 of the state. The EIR is the heart of CEQA and the integrity
17 of the process is dependent on the adequacy of the EIR.

18 The ultimate decision of whether to approve a project, be
that decision right or wrong, is a nullity if based upon an EIR
19 that does not provide the decisionmakers, and the public,
20 with the information about the project that is required by

21 CEQA. The error is prejudicial if the failure to include
relevant information precludes informed decision making and
22 informed public participation, thereby thwarting the statutory
23 goals of the EIR process. When the informational

24 requirements of CEQA are not complied with, an agency has
failed to proceed in a manner required by law and has
25 therefore abused its discretion.

1 16. The Monterey High School/District Office site is the oldest school site in

2 the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District. It contains the oldest structures in the

3 District. One is the Carmel stone stadium constructed in the 1920s and 1930s. The

4 other is the District Office headquarters which is the original Water Colton Grammar

5 School constructed in 1920. The campus uses and office uses are intertwined on the

6 site. There is no dividing line and no physical separation or barrier between them. The

7 site is accessed by seven different driveways from five different city streets. There are

8 at least five existing separate parking areas, none of which can be accessed by car

9 from each other. The site sits in a partial bowl surrounded on four sides by residential
10 neighborhoods that were established prior to the high school. Some houses are at the

11 same level as school district facilities, other rise above it on the hills, and others are

12 below in elevation. The curving residential streets are used primarily for residential
13 uses. The surrounding neighborhoods are typically quiet, and very quiet at night.

14 Sounds carry remarkably clearly. The easternmost edge of the school site fronts on

15 Pacific Street, an arterial, with low office buildings on the opposite side of the street.

16 17. For many decades without controversy the high school has played football

17 games and other games at its stadium during the daytime. The stadium does not have

18 lights or a public address system. Nighttime impacts of the stadium are a known

19 controversial issue. In 2006, MPUSD first proposed installing artificial turf and
20  permanent lights at the stadium. In response, neighbors met with the MPUSD
21 superintendent at the time and the Monterey High principal at the time, Dan Albert Jr., to

22 have a productive dialogue and to craft a compromise agreement. By 2009, the artificial

23 turf had been installed and the superintendent reported to the board that the MPUSD

24 had agreed on no more than four football games to be played at night under portable

25 lights due to the impacts on the neighborhoods.

26 18. In January 2018, the District adopted a Facilities Needs list for each

27 school. The MPUSD identifies its Master Plan as the Facilities Needs Lists for all
28 schools. The Facilities Needs List for Monterey High identified $95 million of facilities

8
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 needs including many projects that would benefit all students and teachers, such as

2 replacing the old single-glazed windows and adding electrical outlets to classrooms.

3 The Facilities Needs List for Monterey High School does not list stadium lights, a public

4 address system, visitor's bleachers, or a press a box.

5 19. In March 2018, the MPUSD Board of Trustees voted to place Measure I

6 on the June 2018 ballot specifically "citing urgent needs to repair 50-year-old schools

7 and support 21st-century instructional methods," according to MPUSD. A MPUSD

8 press release of March 7. 2018 stated in key part as follows:

9 The bond measure is the result of an in-depth Facilities

10 Needs Assessment to determine priority improvements at all

11 schools in the district. Included in the detailed project list are
plans to provide up-to-date science, technology,
12 engineering, arts and math classrooms, fix leaky roofs,

13 replace outdated portables, repair aging plumbing, gas,

14 sewer and electrical systems, update classrooms for career
technical education and workforce training programs and
15 make essential safety and security updates.

16 "Our newest school was built in 1965 and all of our schools

17 are over 50 years old," said MPUSD Board Trustee and

18 Bond Sub-Committee Chair Wendy Root Askew. "It is clear
that our aging classrooms, labs and school facilities are in
19 need of repair to meet modern educational standards."
20 20. The new MPUSD superintendent, PK Diffenbaugh, wanted an athletics
21 project at Monterey High School stadium with artificial turf, rubberized track, and
22 permanent stadium lights. In 2018, MPUSD spent 2010 Measure P bond funds to
23 replace the synthetic turf, install new signage, rubberized track, and new goal posts at
24 the stadium. The school also constructed a brand new modern electronic scoreboard
25 with lights. Measure P was intended to raise funds "to make critical repairs." Even
26 before the June 2018 Measure I bond measure had been voted on by the voters,
27 Superintendent Diffenbaugh directed the MPUSD architect to develop concepts and
28

9
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 plans for permanent stadium lighting, bleachers, and press box, and a new second

2 multi-sports field with bleachers and dugouts.

3 21. The Measure I political campaign was run by the wife of MPUSD

4 Superintendent Diffenbaugh. The campaign funded mailing after mailing urging voters

5 to support Measure I to "fix our crumbling schools" with photographs of outdated

6 bathrooms and claims about only one or two electrical outlets per classroom.

7 22. In June 2018 the voters approved Measure l.

8 23. On or around October 12, 2018, Superintendent Diffenbaugh met with the

9 MPUSD architects to review the 30% drawings of the Stadium and Field project.
10 Subsequently the superintendent claimed that he presented the project drawings to his

11 hand-picked "facilities advisory committee" in late October or November 2018; however,

12 the sole representations are those made by the superintendent. There was no public

13 notice of a committee meeting, no minutes of a meeting, no video, no records of who if

14 anyone attended if anyone did, and no contemporaneous records of what they said if

15 one or more of them did attend a meeting. MPUSD has no record of any statements

16 about the project by any member of the facilities advisory committee that purportedly

17 reviewed the proposed project. Petitioners are not aware of any record that shows that

18 any other project proposal was allowed to be considered for Monterey High to be

19 funded with Measure I funds.

20 24. On or around November 13, 2018, the superintendent presented to the

21 board of trustees his recommendations of proposed Measure I priority projects, of which

22 the Stadium and Field project was the sole Monterey High project. The board was not

23 presented with any other proposal for Measure I projects at Monterey High. There was

24 no meaningful public announcement of the proposed Stadium and Field Project and no

25 effort to involve the neighborhood associations, the neighbors or the people involved the

26 2006 and 2009 compromise agreements.

27 25. On or about June 10, 2019, MPUSD broke ground on a new science

28 building project adjacent to the stadium at Monterey High School. It was estimated to

10
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 cost $15 million of Measure P funds and was scheduled for completion in July 2020.

2 MPUSD did not do any CEQA review prior to constructing the project.

3 26. On or around July 25, 2019, MPUSD released for public review an initial

4 study and proposed mitigated negative declaration (IS/MND) for the Stadium and Field

5 Project. The document had been prepared by EMC Planning Group, Inc. in Monterey,

6 whose founder and senior principal is Michael Groves, whom MPUSD has employed as

7 its Monterey High School head varsity baseball coach since 1980. MPUSD and Groves

8 did not discuss or disclose any conflicts of interest with his work on the CEQA

9 document.

10 27. Still MPUSD did not reach out to the nearby neighborhood associations or

11 the neighboring property owners. Monterey Vista Neighborhood Association represents

12 the largest neighborhood in the city. The lone notice to the residents and the taxpayers

13 about the IS/MND was a tiny legal advertisement in 7-point font in the Monterey County

14 Herald. A taxpayer saw it and alerted others.

15 28. By the comment deadline of August 26, 2019, the public had submitted

16 more than two hundred of pages of comments and concerns on the initial study and

17 proposed mitigated negative declaration. The comments and concerns were on a wide

18 variety of impacts, including expert comments on noise and lighting. Many comments

19 opposed spending of taxpayer funds on an unnecessary project where facilities already
20 existed, and other comments addressed the importance of fixing the crumbling high

21 school facilities as promised by MPUSD and the Measure I publicity. Other comments

22 addressed the need for projects that would increase resilience to climate change, such

23 as air conditioning, insulated windows, and solar panels. Neurologists commented on

24 the known harm to brains that football can cause, even a single season or single game

25 of football, and how the school district should not be facilitating such potential harm.

26 29. Comments pointed out that the initial study and proposed mitigated
27 negative declaration did not disclose that the stadium was historic or discuss the

28 impacts of the project on any of the historic Carmel stone resources at the campus.

11
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 30. Comments on the initial study and proposed mitigated negative

2 declaration also pointed out that the initial study had not discussed parking despite the

3 fact that the stadium/field project would replace the 2.2-acre overflow parking lot with a

4 new second sports field. The existing overflow parking area can accommodate at least

5 150 cars according to a planning expert.

6 31. The following month, September 2019, MPUSD hired C2G Engineers to

7 prepare an analysis of onsite parking and to propose parking projects at the shared

8 MPUSD/MHS site. C2G prepared multiple versions of parking plans that MPUSD

9 administrators reviewed. The plans were refined to provide additional parking for the

10 stadium and multi-sport field. MPUSD worked closely with C2G Engineers on the plans,

11 and tried to make the Parking Project fit the needs of the Stadium and Field Project.

12 Accessibility and ADA path of travel to and from the stadium and field were significant

13 issues and remain significant issues to this day. The existing parking lots did not have

14 the required ADA parking and access to and from the stadium and field sites. The

15 District Office is not ADA accessible. The science building project did not provide ADA

16 access improvements to the adjacent stadium. MPUSD did not engage the public in

17 any of the process for the parking project and the accessibility needs.

18 32. In October 2019, MPUSD announced that MPUSD would prepare an

19 environmental impact report for the stadium/field project.

20 33. In November 2019, MPUSD board approved a contract with consultant

21 Ascent Environmental of Oakland and Sacramento to prepare the environmental impact

22 report for the Stadium and Field Project. The contract required Ascent to prepare a
23 parking analysis.

24 34. In early 2020, employees of Ascent made a site visit to the project site. a

25 Petitioners are not aware of any other personal visits by Ascent to the project site.

26 35. On or around February 7, 2020, MPUSD released a notice of preparation

27 of an environmental impact report.

28

12
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 36. On or around March 17, 2020, MPUSD closed its schools due to the

2 Covid-19 pandemic.

3 37. On or about April 13, 2020, the public comment period on the notice of

4 preparation closed.

5 38. On or around April 14, 2020, the MPUSD Board of Trustees adopted

6 Resolution 19/20-23 that its capital projects were "essential" and could proceed during

7 the pandemic including "Monterey High School Parking Lot Improvements Project

8 #8216" and "Monterey High School Stadium Improvements Project #8243." The capital

9 projects staff and consultants - project managers, architects, engineers, and the EIR

10 preparer - continued to work throughout the pandemic on the Stadium and Field Project

11 and Parking Project.

12 39. In August 2020, MPUSD submitted its final Parking Project plans to the

13 Division of State Architect (DSA). MPUSD did not want the DSA to discover that

14 Parking Areas 2 and 3 near the MPUSD Office are intended to be overflow parking for

15 the Stadium and Field Project. MPUSD's concern was because "there is no
16 [accessible] path of travel from the District office to the stadium!!!" as stated by MPUSD

17 Capital Facilities Senior Director Paul Anderson. The MPUSD office is not ADA

18 accessible and does not have an accessible restroom or water fountain, according to

19 MPUSD records. Despite the lack of accessibility, the EIR relied on "the use of the

20 MPUSD Office parking lot" as 102 parking stalls of "the available parking supply" of 296

21 spaces onsite for events at the stadium and field.

22 40. On or about September 23, 2020, the DSA approved the plans for the

23 MPUSD Parking Project. The approved plans show construction of four parking areas

24 at the shared site. The plans include more than half an acre of new parking, and would

25 be materially reconstruct and redevelop the existing facilities. None of the four parking

26 areas is connected to any other of the four areas.

27 Parking Area 1 is adjacent to the northwest of the stadium. This

28 area contains low Carmel stone walls, sometimes called curbs.

13
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 Parking Area 2 is partially in front of, or east of, the District Office

2 and would replace the existing historic lawn and high school

3 basketball courts with surface parking. The proposed new

4 construction would demolish at least three intact and well preserved

5 Carmel stone walls totaling more than 300 linear feet.

6 Parking Area 3 is adjacent to the east side of the stadium and

7 borders the north and east side of the proposed multi-sport field.

8 Parking Area 4 is adjacent to the southeast corner of the stadium

9 and borders the south side of the proposed multi-sport field.

10 There had been no public review and no effort to tell the public about the Parking

11 Project process. There was no public announcement. No historic resources are

12 identified on the plans and there was no analysis of the impacts on the Carmel stone

13 walls.

14 41. In November 2020, the MPUSD released for public review the draft EIR

15 for the Stadium and Field Project. The project objectives were as folllows:

16 "Improve on-campus athletic facilities at Monterey High School for

17 athlete practice and games to enhance opportunities for
after-school athletic and extracurricular activities for students."
18

19 "Facilitate night-time athletic events and practices at the Dan Albert
Stadium."
20
"Provide adequate visitor seating separated from the home team
21 seating area at the Dan Albert Stadium." The claim was this would
22 cause "a better game experience for all attendees and enhanced

23 safety for spectators."

24 42. The Draft EIR stated that the project features included adding the

25 following permanent developments to the historic stone stadium:

26 A public address system with speakers mounted on the four field

27 light poles at 70 feet high and other levels.

28

14

1 Four 70-foot tall "field light standards" or poles each of the four

2 standards would have three levels of LED lighting arrays: one level

3 of arrays at 70 feet high, each with 9 or 10 LED luminaires, each of
which is a light fixture with densely packed individual light emitting
4 diodes, of 900 watts; another luminaire array at a height of 60 feet

5 light fixtures, and one level of lighting at an approximate height of
15 feet angled upward into the night.
6

7 300-seat aluminum bleachers for visiting team fans.

8 A press box.

9 The project description also included a new multi-sport field with dugouts for two teams

10 and bleachers for attendees, and approximately five parking stalls to the north of the

11 multi-sport field. Adjacent to the new field would be a building containing a weight room

12 and a team room. The field would replace a 2.2 acre lot used for overflow parking.

13 43. The Draft EIR said that the noise impacts from the public address system

14 and lighting impacts from the stadium lights would be significant and unavoidable. The

15 Draft EIR included an expert historic resources evaluation that found that the stadium

16 was historic and eligible for the California Register of Historic Places based on three

17 separate criteria and eligible for the National Register of Historic Places due to its

18 distinct materials and expert workmanship. The historic resources evaluation pointed

19 out that the stadium had been poorly treated over the years, and that it should be

20 preserved and protected. The evaluation also pointed out that the science building

21 project had destroyed two historic stone patios, benches, and a stone wall that for

22 nearly 100 years had served students as a gathering place and that graced the entry to

23 the school.

24 44. The Draft EIR stated that the primary construction access for the 16+

25 month construction project would be the MPUSD driveway off of Logan Lane, a narrow

26 and substandard city street of older single family residences. One Logan Lane resident

27 referred to "the dilapidated city pathway known as Logan Lane." The Draft EIR did not

28 include a parking analysis or a traffic report.

15

21CV002755

1 45. On or around January 12, 2021, the comment period closed on the draft

2 EIR. Hundreds of pages of comments were submitted, including expert comments on

3 issues of noise, lighting, historic resources, and many other adverse impacts.
4 Commenters also addressed the need to make the high school safe for students,

5 teachers and staff for the eventual return to school after the pandemic, including specific

6 issues such as ventilation, filtration, barriers and distancing. During the comment

7 period, Taxpayers had discovered the existence of the approved Parking Project plans

8 through a California Public Records Act request. Comments on the Stadium and Field

9 Project EIR pointed out that the Parking Project was part of the whole of the project

10 because it provided parking to replace the parking capacity lost by the conversion of the

11 overflow lot to the new multi-sport field and because parking demand would be

12 increased with the addition of the bleachers at the stadium and at the new field and the

13 lighting.

14 46. On April 27, 2021, MPUSD took steps to widen its Logan Lane driveway in

15 order to accommodate access to the project site. MPUSD applied to the City of

16 Monterey for a building permit and encroachment permit to widen its driveway. The

17 widening would widen the driveway onto city property, and would require a retaining wall

18 on city property due to the slope. MPUSD estimated the construction time at one month

19 when school is not in session. MPUSD in its application did not disclose the Carmel

20 stone walls on its property adjacent to its driveway.

21 47. On or around April 13, 2021, the MPUSD board of trustees adopted

22 Resolution 20/21-24 that purported to "render the zoning ordinances of the City of

23 Monterey inapplicable" to "projects under Measure and P" at the six MPUSD "School

24 Sites" in the city (the "Exemption Action"). The Exemption Action claimed that "the

25 District has balanced the interests of the public" and "determined that the interests of

26 the public are best served by the District" exempting the projects "from any applicable

27 zoning ordinances." Resolution 20/21-24 is a project under CEQA and prior compliance

28 its regulations, and case law thereunder, is required. Plaintiffs are informed and

16
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 believed that the District did not give actual written or mailed notice to any of the

2 affected property owners near any of the six listed exempted school sites, did not give

3 notice to the neighborhoods associations in which the six sites are located, and did not

4 conduct any CEQA review or make any CEQA determinations or findings related to or

5 associated with the Exemption Action.

6 48. Also on or around April 13, 2021, MPUSD official Ryan Altemeyer read to

7 the school board from a prepared "script" about the Parking Project. The Altemeyer

8 script stated "we will not presently have plans to create additional parking for MHS or

9 the" District Office. The script continued "we have a need to bid some work this

10 summer to do maintenance" of "repaving and restriping" the lots that comprise Area 1 of

11 the MPUSD Parking Project. The script stated that staff "will be preparing bid

12 documents ... and will come back to you [the board] when we have a lowest responsive
13 bidder ... and can recommend award of that project."

14 49. On June 16, 2021, MPUSD started demolishing the Area 1 parking lot that

15 the Parking Project calls Area 1B. By the end of the week Area 1B paving had been

16 reduced to dirt and rubble. There had been no board approval and no urgent need for

17 demolition.

18 50. On or around June 22, 2021, the MPUSD board of trustees discussed and

19 ratified a $1.7 million project to demolish and reconstruct Parking Area 1. This action

20 was in large part the approval of constructing Area 1 of the Parking Project. It

21 authorized the wholesale removal of all paving in Area 1 - both the Area 1A upper lot

22 and the Area 1B lower lot - and a wholesale grading and redevelopment with tree

23 removal, new concrete walls, massive new wastewater conduits, storm water drainage,

24 and electrical conduits for future parking area lights although no lighting has been
25 approved. New features include the ADA access and the emergency access route that

26 are required for the Stadium and Field Project, and other features that were identified in

27 the public comments on the draft EIR for the Stadium and Field Project. The $1.7

28 a million project was styled as a "change order No. 12" for the science building project.

17
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION

21CV002755

1 According to MPUSD, the science building project had been completed months earlier.

2 No bidding process had been followed. The school board was presented with a single

3 bid instead of the "lowest responsive bidder." The sole bid was from the former science

4 building contractor whose crew had been absent from the site for two months.

5 51. MPUSD did not perform prior CEQA review for the Parking Area 1 project. 1

6 The June 22, 2021 approval materially expanded the science building project limits to

7 include the entire Parking Area 1. MPUSD did not prepare a historic report and did not

8 adopt mitigations for impacts to the historic Carmel stone walls present at Area 1.

9 These low stone walls, or stone curbs, are within the project limits and immediately

10 adjacent to the paved vehicle stalls and no CEQA exemption can be used where

11 historic resources are involved. MPUSD has constructed new modern concrete curbs

12 immediately adjacent to the historic stone walls and did not protect the walls during

13 construction. The MPUSD contractor dumped sandbags and gravel on the stone walls,

14 propped metal construction fencing on top of the walls, and left them exposed to harm

15 by construction operations. The stone walls have been and are actively being harmed

16 by the construction. The plans do not identify the stone walls and do not identity them

17 as historic. The only mention of "curbs" in the plans is the direction to remove the

18 curbs, and the plan directive shows arrows pointed at the Carmel stone curbs.

19 52. On or around July 9, 2021, MPUSD released the final EIR for the Stadium

20 and Field Project. MPUSD had made several material changes to the project following

21 the close of public comment on the Draft EIR. Each of the changes materially increased

22 the size and scope of the project. MPUSD had not revised the EIR project description.

23 53. MPUSD had made changes to the Stadium and Field Project project limits

24 that had material adverse impacts that had not been disclosed in the Draft EIR.

25 MPUSD had added all of Parking Project Area 4 to the Stadium and Field Project when

26 MPUSD redrew and enlarged the project limits and expanded the scope to include the

27 reconstruction of the Area 4 parking lot that is southwest of the stadium and
28 immediately south of the lower field, and when MPUSD added a new emergency

18
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 access route from the Martin Street driveway through Area 4 to the lower field, which

2 would involve demolishing and reconstructing the remainder of Area 4.

3 54. MPUSD had added to the Stadium and Field Project at least two large

4 portions of the Parking Project Area 3, specifically the large portion north of the Logan

5 Lane driveway to be used for construction staging for more than a year which would

6 render unusable its estimated 10 parking stalls and would necessitate its eventual full

7 reconstruction, and the five or more spaces at the north edge of the lower field that were

8 shown as part of Area 3 of the Parking Project. Area 3 is accessed solely from Logan

9 Lane. These material changes were not announced or described in the Final EIR.

10 Instead, they were hidden in the Final EIR figures which had been changed from the

11 Draft EIR figures.

12 55. MPUSD Final EIR Master Response 14 announced that "No spectator

13 access would be provided to the lower field on Logan Lane. In this way, the proposed

14 project will not increase traffic related to after-hours games on Logan Lane." The EIR

15 did not explain how spectator access would be prohibited, what this new project

16 element would look like, and what impacts this new project element would have, such

17 as where and from what other driveways the spectators would access the field and the

18 stadium. The Logan Lane driveway is the closest access from a public street to the

19 lower field. The Logan Lane driveway also has convenient access to the stadium. For

20 decades students have used the Logan Lane driveway to walk to and from the school

21 bus loading zone on Pacific Street by the school tennis courts.

22 56. For years, the MPUSD Board of Trustees has made unanimous votes on
23 essentially every agenda item. Some years every single vote is unanimous to approve

24 the superintendent's recommended action on the hundreds of agenda items and actions

25 before the board every year. Perhaps once or at most twice a year there is a split vote

26 on the board, out of hundreds of actions on the board agendas every year.

27 57. On or around July 27, 2021, the MPUSD Board of Trustees at its regular

28 meeting held a public hearing on the 243-page draft environmental impact report and

19
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 the 958-page final environmental impact report. After the close of the hearing, the

2 board did not ask a single question. The board voted unanimously to adopt Resolution

3 #21/22-02 to certify the EIR for the Stadium and Field Project. Then the board held a

4 public hearing on the project. After the close of the public hearing, the board did not ask

5 a single question about the project. The board voted unanimously to adopt Resolution

6 #21/22-03 to approve the Stadium and Field Project. The board found that the project

7 would have significant and unmitigated noise impacts and lighting impacts. The board

8 adopted a statement of overriding considerations.

9 58. On July 28, 2021, MPUSD filed a notice of determination for its July 27,

10 2021 project approvals.

11 59. The MPUSD superintendent openly urged his teachers and staff to

12 support the project. He was friendly and responsive to commenters who supported the

13 project, and was generally nonresponsive to those who asked questions or were

14 opposed. MPUSD trustees at their meetings allowed hostile actions by pro-project

15 football boosters toward project opponents and those with simple questions. Pro-

16 project attendees showed up in full football uniform, hissing when certain members of

17 the public spoke at board meetings, using aggressive body language and insults toward

18 people who questioned the project. A local paper published a letter to the editor by a

19 writer who wanted to know which "miserable people" are the "assholes" who have
20 expressed concerns about the lights. MPUSD trustees did not condemn such actions

21 and instead joined in the offensive comments about people concerned about the project

22 and concerned about the lack of MPUSD transparency. Trustee Amanda Whitmire, in

23 an email sent from her official MPUSD email account, insulted one concerned resident

24 as having "totally lost her crackers." Whitmire's identified the person by name. Trustee

25 Tom Jennings, in an email sent from his official MPUSD email account, disparaged as

26 "a bunch of crap" the efforts by public interest petitioner Taxpayers for MPUSD
27 Accountability to obtain public records about the Stadium and Field Project. Trustee

28 Jennings complained that the California Public Records Act lawsuit was "a bogus

20
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 lawsuit" - despite the fact that MPUSD released more than 25,000 pages of public

2 records related to the stadium project. The board of trustees holds its meetings at night

3 in an isolated location in the former Fort Ord and petitioners' members and supporters

4 have been reluctant to attend the meetings due to the hostility, the distant parking lots

5 and the isolation.

6 60. MPUSD did not have the vast majority of its projects' records available

7 online and did not make any project records available for in-person inspection because

8 it MPUSD says it does not have paper records. MPUSD treated requests for access to

9 stadium records as California Public Records Act request and typically took ten days or

10 longer to respond to even the simplest requests.

11 61. MPUSD has not completed the vast majority of the projects at Monterey

12 High School that were listed on the January 2018 Facilities Needs Assessment, the

13 MPUSD Master Plan that was the basis for the Measure I campaign. These project

14 needs include replacing 53,690 square feet of windows with double glazed windows,

15 adding 10 new electrical outlets per classroom, replacing classroom lighting and

16 controls, replacing three aged portable classrooms that are over 50 years old,
17 renovating the gymnasium, and replacing exterior door thresholds for 77 doors.

19 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION: CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT -

20 STADIUM AND FIELD PROJECT (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5.)

21 62. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1

22 through 61 above, and 63 through 122 below, as though fully set forth herein, and

23 further allege as follows.

24 63. Respondent MPUSD has failed to adopt sufficient and legally supportable

25 findings, failing to adopt a legally sufficient mitigation and monitoring reporting program,

26 and failing to prepare an adequate environmental impact report prior to approval of the

27 Stadium and Field Project. MPUSD's actions, and each of them, constitutes a

28 prejudicial abuse of discretion in that Respondent has failed to proceed in a manner

21
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 required by law, it did not adopt requisite findings, and/or its decisions and findings are

2 not supported by substantial evidence.

3 64. Information and evidence in the record, as well as in the findings made by

4 Respondent in its project approvals, show several procedural and substantive

5 deficiencies under CEQA. The adopted mitigations are inadequate, the adopted

6 mitigation monitoring and reporting plan is inadequate, and the project is inconsistent

7 with the City of Monterey general plan, land use and/or zoning regulations. The EIR

8 failed to adequately consider and impose reasonable mitigation measures proposed by

9 experts in their comments on the Draft EIR. The EIR's approach was to reject every

10 single proposed mitigation for the noise and lighting impacts.

11 65. MPUSD has improperly segmented the review of the Stadium and Field

12 Project, the Parking Project, and the Logan Lane Driveway Widening, each of which are

13 part of the whole of the project that should have all been evaluated in a single

14 environmental document. Instead, MPUSD used a piecemeal approach to analyze the

15 interrelated and interdependent projects and their environmental impacts. Piecemealing

16 or segmenting is explicitly forbidden by CEQA, because dividing a project into a number

17 of pieces would allow a lead agency to minimize the apparent environmental impacts of

18 a project by evaluating individual pieces separately, each of which may have a

19 less-than-significant impact on the environment, but which together may result in a
20 significant impact. Segmenting a project may also hinder developing comprehensive

21 mitigation strategies. The Parking Project and the Logan Lane Driveway Widening

22 Project, and each of them, are necessary for access purposes for the construction and

23 operation of the Stadium and Field Project, and are a reasonably foreseeable
24 consequences of approving the Stadium and Field Project, and they are integral project
25 component that should be analyzed within the environmental analysis. All necessary

26 components of the project should have been included in the EIR.

27 66. The EIR did not include a traffic report for the impacts of the anticipated

28 16+ months of construction and for the impacts of the operational use of the Stadium

22
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 and Field Project. The EIR did not include a parking analysis. No traffic expert is

2 identified on the EIR's list of EIR preparers.

3 67. Expert traffic engineer Robert Kahn opined as to specific deficiencies in

4 the EIR analysis of traffic, including the failure to quantify from both a traffic and vehicle

5 miles traveled (VMT) standpoint the construction impacts to the surrounding residential

6 community, and the EIR's failure to evaluate the increased operational effects of the

7 expanded facilities, including the additional 450 seats. Traffic expert Kahn is a member

8 of the member of the California Institute of Transportation Engineers SB-743 Committee

9 for several years working with the California Office of Planning and Research (OPR) to

10 develop the OPR Guidelines on vehicle miles traveled. He opined that "Additional traffic

11 generation and VMT will occur ... and these increases in traffic must be quantified," that

12 the VMT claims in the draft EIR are inconsistent with other MPUSD statements, and that

13 it is "very likely and reasonably foreseeable that" the 110-daily trip VMT thresholds will

14 be exceeded. He opined that the EIR's qualitative analysis of construction traffic "is not

15 sufficiently credible to be considered an adequate VMT analysis because methods exist

16 to undertake a quantitative analysis and because the qualitative analysis does not follow

17 the City's Guidelines." He opined that a more regional VMT modeling evaluation of the

18 potential increase in VMT and a full trip generation analysis is required. Traffic engineer

19 Kahn opined that the EIR traffic mitigations were not adequate to mitigate the unusual
20 geometrics of the left turns on the construction access in and out of Logan Lane at its

21 uncontrolled intersection with Pacific Street opposite the driveway to 757 Pacific, a busy

22 medical complex. He opined as to the potentially significant and unmitigated
23 operational and safety impacts of using Logan Lane that the EIR had not evaluated and

24 analyzed. These impacts include the pedestrians (high school students) and vehicles

25 that use Logan Lane for access to the school and the residents who use Logan Lane as

26 their primary residential access. Traffic engineer Kahn opined that a traffic a safety
27 evaluation should be conducted for construction routes and operational use, and the

28 traffic safety evaluation should include all vehicle/pedestrian collisions instead of the

23
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 EIR's narrow focus on collisions involving 12- to 18-year-olds. Traffic expert Kahn

2 opined that there was no adequate parking analysis in the EIR and that the Parking

3 Project must be included in the CEQA documentation for the Stadium and Field Project

4 to ensure that the additional parking demand resulting from the increase in seating and

5 the uses of the multi-sport field do not adversely impact parking on the adjoining

6 residential neighborhoods.

7 68. MPUSD has a poor record of stewardship of its historic resources. The

8 site has historic Carmel stone resources dating from its development in the 1920s and

9 1930s. The largest single Carmel stone resource is the stadium. Mineweaser opined

10 that all of the historic bleachers should be preserved in order to be consistent with the

11 Secretary of Interior's standards. This was consistent with the project limits as shown in

12 the historic resources evaluation. The historic stadium bleachers and historic stadium

13 walls would not being restored as part of this project. MPUSD drew a gerrymandered

14 project limits line that includes the top of the bleachers where the press box will be

15 constructed, and then snakes down both sides of the bleachers to include the new 70-

16 foot LED lighting standards. MPUSD did this to try to avoid the requirement to restore

17 and preserve the bleachers. MPUSD did not adopt a mitigation that would prevent or

18 remedy foreseeable harm to the historic bleachers and stone walls during construction

19 of the press box and the stadium lighting. MPUSD objected and redefined the "work

20 area" to an overly narrow definition, limited to the confines of the removed stones and

21 installed project features. This is approach is too narrow to be consistent with CEQA.

22 The project limits must include the parts of the historic stadium where workers would

23 stand and stage equipment in order to do the construction work. The project limits

24 should include all the bleachers and all the bleachers should be restored and preserved,

25 instead of the continuous pattern of neglect and harm. MPUSD did not adopt

26 mitigations to address the potential foreseeable accidental harm to historic resources

27 during project construction and operation.

28

24
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 69. The EIR did not identify, analyze or mitigate the potential harm to the

2 Carmel stone walls adjacent to the Logan Lane driveway construction and operational

3 access for the Stadium and Field project, and for the stone walls adjacent to the

4 proposed staging area for the Stadium and Field project. The EIR did not adequately

5 consider the cumulative impacts to the historic stone resources in light of the Stadium

6 and Field project, the Logan Lane Driveway Widening Project, and the Parking Project.

7 70. The historic resources recommendations by the historic architect Craig

8 Mineweaser were not made a mandatory part of the approved Stadium and Field

9 Project and were not adopted as conditions of approval or as mitigations. The EIR

10 claimed that the Mineweaser recommendations are "design elements." MPUSD could

11 change aspects of the design or allow the actual work to vary from plans at any time,

12 which is reasonably foreseeable given MPUSD's actions in recent years that have
13 shown its lack of understanding of, and disregard for, historic resources, and MPUSD's

14 many after-the-fact change orders. There is no way for the public to monitor the

15 construction because historically MPUSD has blocked public access to its construction

16 sites, sO by the time the public discovered the harm it would be too late. This is shown

17 by MPUSD's actions as to the science building project when in 2019 MPUSD

18 demolished the historic stone patios and benches and threw away the irreplaceable

19 stones instead of salvaging them as preservation requires. It is shown by MPUSD's

20 actions to intentionally remove historic stadium steps to accommodate science building

21 construction, then replaced the steps in a manner inconsistent with CEQA and historic
22 preservation standards. In summer 2020, four months after the historic preservation

23 consultant informed MPUSD that the Carmel stone structures were historic, MPUSD

24 removed the historic Carmel stone wall close by the stadium, and threw away those
25 irreplaceable stones as well. MPUSD did not perform any CEQA review for the science

26 building project, and MPUSD did not adopt any mitigations for the loss of these historic

27 resources.

21CV002755

1 71. The October 2020 Mineweaser report was based on what Mineweaser

2 called "completed drawings" of the project dated August 2020. However, MPUSD did

3 not include any "completed drawings" in the Draft EIR released in November 2020. In

4 response to numerous questions from members of the public about the project plans,

5 elevations and schematics, MPUSD responded that the project was not yet at that level

6 of detail. MPUSD did not release any plans for public review until the Final EIR, and

7 those plans are dated April 27, 2021.

8 72. Planning expert Diane Kushlan opined that the EIR materially

9 underestimated impacts because it materially underestimated the number of likely

10 attendees at events. The Draft EIR looked only at ticket sales, instead of at the number

11 of attendees. The Final EIR revised this analysis to include some people who do not

12 pay to attend such as coaches, MPUSD staff, and players. The Final EIR was still

13 materially inaccurate because failed to count Monterey High School students in the

14 attendance totals. Monterey High students are a large portion of attendees and they do

15 not buy tickets because they get in free with a student body card. The EIR also

16 materially underestimated impacts because the EIR relied solely on the ticket sales data

17 for the 2019 recent football season when MHS a had a losing record and the MHS head

18 coach had been suspended for behavior issues, factors which tend to reduce
19 attendance at football games. The EIR improperly inflated the existing stadium
20 capacity, apparently to try to reduce the significance of the 300-seat increase for

21 visitor's bleachers. The EIR claimed that the stadium seated 1,600, which is
22 inconsistent with years of MPUSD statements that the stadium seats 1,180. The 1,180

23 figure is consistent with the MPUSD statement that 24" per seat is the proper calculation

24 for the bleachers due to unevenness of the Carmel stone. The actual post-project

25 stadium seating would be 1,180 existing + 300 proposed = 1,480 total. That is more

26 than 125% of the existing seating capacity. The 150 bleacher seats at the multi-sport

27 field plus the 300 new visitor's seats at the stadium would mean a total increased

28 seating capacity of 450, which is a 138% of current stadium seating capacity. Kushlan

26
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 opined that the EIR position that the capacity of the stadium is irrelevant to attendance

2 and parking is neither accurate nor supported. Kushlan opined that the EIR conclusion

3 that an improved spectator environment (lights, new seating, and public address

4 system) would have no impact on attendance was an unsupported and illogical

5 conclusion, and she opined that there had not been a goof faith effort in investigated

6 and quantifying the change in attendance following the addition of the project features to

7 the stadium. Planning expert Kushlan pointed out serious informational omissions in the

8 EIR parking analysis including safety, the lack of willingness by attendees to walk to a
9 destination if there are poor pedestrian conditions, misdirection in the course of travel

10 which is the case for all access routes to the stadium; street crossings such as the

11 minor arterial Pacific Street; or terrain such as walking up hill to the stadium location.

12 She opined that the EIR had failed to disclose and discuss the fact that travel by

13 attendees between the parking lots and the stadium would happen largely, if not

14 entirely, at dusk and at night which is a material safety factor.

15 73. Expert planner Kushlan opined that the Final EIR's announcement that "no

16 spectator access would be provided to the lower field on Logan Lane" contradicts the

17 EIR assumptions about access for spectators using the off-site parking facilities. She

18 opined that spectators who park on Pacific Street or in the public parking lots have to

19 walk up and down Logan Lane to attend events at the lower field and the stadium. The

20 Logan Lane driveway provides access to the parking that is included in the EIR's

21 parking calculations for spectators and to two ADA parking spaces required for
22 development of the lower field. Prohibiting spectator access to the lower field on Logan

23 Lane would mean prohibiting access to the required parking for spectators. Students

24 have for decades used Logan Lane to walk between the school bus zone on Pacific

25 Street and the high school. Spectators are dropped off on Pacific Street or Logan Lane

26 to walk up the driveway to the school site. The Final EIR provided no explanation is

27 provided as to how MPUSD would block access that has existed for decades and what

28 physical changes would be made. The new project feature of blocking spectator access

27
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY

FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 via Logan Lane materially changed the project description and the analysis of access

2 and parking in multiple material ways, and there are no revised analysis and revised

3 conclusions. The Final EIR claim that "no spectator access would be provided to the

4 lower field on Logan Lane" does not address the access of the many event attendees

5 who are participants, rather than spectators. The claim also is at odds with the Final

6 EIR statement that "no gate will be constructed at the end of Logan Lane." The

7 ambiguous and shifting project description is inconsistent with CEQA's requirement for

8 a stable and fixed project description.

9 74. The project description was not fixed and final in other material ways, as

10 well.

11 75. The Final EIR also revealed a new emergency access route off of Martin

12 Street as part of the Stadium and Field Project. Construction of the new emergency

13 access would require reconstruction of most of Parking Area 4, removal of 90-foot tall

14 trees, and new retaining walls. The access route construction would require closing the

15 entire student parking lot (Parking Area 4) for at least three weeks, and likely far longer

16 for the demolition and reconstruction of all of Parking Area 4. This means that more

17 than 100 student cars would be displaced. The EIR did not adequately analyze and

18 mitigate these new impacts that are outside the Draft EIR project limits and are not

19 included in the Draft EIR analysis. The project limits were not redrawn to include the

20 new emergency access route and Parking Area 4 construction.

21 76. The project description changed materially over time, in addition to the

22 ways discussed above, and the project's geographical limits changed materially. After

23 the comment period on the draft EIR was closed, MPUSD enlarged the project limits in

24 material ways, including redrawing the limits to add portions of the Parking Project in

25 two different areas, one by the music building (part of Area 4) and one by the Logan

26 Lane driveway. MPUSD also added the Martin Street emergency access to the project

27 scope of the project, which requires the reconstruction of the remainder of Area 4. The

28 project description was incomplete in part because it did not include these parking

28
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 areas. The addition of these two portions of the Parking Project shows that MPUSD

2 has segmented the approvals of the whole of the project. The project description and

3 EIR analysis also is incomplete because it did not describe or evaluate the widening of

4 the Logan Lane driveway to the site for purposes of construction access and operational

5 access

6 77. Noise expert Derek Watry proposed that the metal bleachers could be

7 replaced with wooden or plastic bleachers in order to reduce the noise caused by

8 bleacher stomping. The Final EIR rejected the mitigation as infeasible saying that even

9 if the noise of bleacher stomping were reduced through the use of wood or plastic the

10 impacts would be unchanged because "if aluminum bleachers are not available to make

11 noise, the crowd could simply cheer louder." That response is not in good faith and

12 does not reflect the fact that people cannot yell loudly for a sustained period of time, and

13 yet a they can stomp for a long time which causes more discordant and amplified noise.

14 Stomping on metal bleachers is a much more energy-efficient and effective way for

15 crowds to make a lot of noise than cheering which is why crowds do it.

16 78. Lighting expert James Benya pointed out that the DEIR technical lighting

17 analysis was not prepared by a professional engineer - rather, it was prepared by a

18 stadium lights manufacturer who provides free calculations to support its hoped-for

19 sales of its lighting products. Lighting expert Benya commented that the Draft EIR

20 lighting impacts analysis was flawed and unreliable. Benya commented that the lighting

21 impacts analysis did not adequately take into account the topography of the residential

22 areas surrounding the high school, specifically residential areas some 40 feet and 50

23 feet below the elevation of the stadium, and other residential areas some 40 feet above

24 the elevation of the stadium. The EIR responded with non sequiturs, saying that the

25 stadium site "is flat, suggesting that illumination at the property boundaries should not

26 be substantially affected by the site topography." The EIR response did not address the
27 failure to consider lighting impacts past the property boundaries, at residences higher

28 and lower than the stadium site. The Final EIR attached a materially revised appendix

29
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 B lighting analysis with inadequate explanation of what had changed and the different
2 impacts. In any event, MPUSD did not adopt any mitigation or monitoring that would

3 ensure that the project lighting impacts would be measured and would not exceed the

4 levels claimed in the EIR. MPUSD made no effort to mitigate the impacts of glare,

5 skyglow, and more, and rejected every single lighting mitigation proposed by lighting

6 experts and by members of the public. The lone lighting mitigation 3.1-3 addresses only

7 the times and days of use. Lighting expert Benya commented that cell facilities are

8 often added to tall stadium lighting fixtures and that cell towers are reasonably
9 foreseeable and should be prohibited. The EIR refused to add the proposed mitigation.

10 The issue of cell facilities is very real for the residents in the neighborhoods surrounding

11 the Monterey High School because they recently went through years of battle with a
12 telecommunications company that wanted to install 13 small-cell facilities in the

13 Monterey Vista, Skyline and Old Town neighborhoods, and, following a 7-hour city

14 planning commission meeting, the residents ultimately succeeded.

15 79. The flaws and inadequacies of the environmental review include an
16 incomplete and inadequate discussion of environmental setting, an inadequate and

17 incomplete project description, an inaccurate baseline, and an inadequate and

18 incomplete investigation, discussion or analysis of potentially adverse impacts to, of,

19 and/or on noise, lighting, historic resources, baselines, views, aesthetics, community
20 characteristics, biological resources, wildlife linkages, parking, development on slopes,

21 drainage, erosion, traffic, traffic and pedestrian safety, traffic metrics and methodology,

22 access, transportation, circulation, infrastructure, public utilities, wastewater, water use,

23 water quality, water contamination, soil contamination, soils and geology, sewage,

24 grading, public services, air quality, greenhouse gases, global warming, utilities, land

25 use, setbacks, open space, and cultural resources. The flaws and inadequacies of
26 environmental review include an incomplete and inadequate discussion, investigation,

27 or analysis of cumulative impacts, growth-inducing impacts, piecemealing, inconsistency

28 with general plan policies, precedent-setting nature of the approvals, inconsistency with

30
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 the City Code, mitigations, adequacy of alternatives, the hiding or omission of expert

2 reports and analyses, other missing documents, changes to environmental documents

3 absent adequate discussion and analysis, and other defects. The EIR failed to
4 adequately evaluate the effect of the adopted measures in the impact analysis. These

5 issues, the violations of CEQA, and the potential adverse environmental effects of these

6 violations were not investigated adequately or addressed adequately in the CEQA

7 documentation or by Respondents.

8 80. The flaws and inadequacies of the environmental review also include
9 inadequate investigation and discussion of the project's inconsistency with the zoning

10 ordinance and the general plan. The environmental review was piecemealed and

11 environmental review was inappropriately deferred. Respondents failed to incorporate

12 reasonable mitigation measures that would eliminate or substantially reduce the

13 environmental impacts of the project. Many of the mitigations adopted by Respondents

14 do not have adequate metrics or performance standards or are measured from an

15 inaccurate baseline or are not enforceable. Many of the mitigations adopted by

16 Respondents are unlikely to be successful based on evidence in the record. The EIR

17 states that certain mitigations could be done "if feasible." These are conditional and

18 therefore unreliable mitigations. It is uncertain as to whether these mitigation would be

19 implemented, if at all. The EIR does not adequately identify who would determine

20 feasibility, on what basis, and if those determinations would involve public participation.

21 81. The EIR analysis is based on flawed assumptions, assumptions that are
22 inadequately explained, or assumptions that have influence or effects that are

23 inadequately investigated or discussed. The EIR failed to adequately address

24 alternatives within the range of activities contemplated. The EIR did not adequately
25 respond to comments under CEQA. Respondents failed to adopt legally adequate

26 findings as required by law. Respondents failed to adopt a legally adequate statement

27 of overriding considerations. Respondents and the EIR failed to comply with CEQA

28 requirements for consideration and evaluation of information. The EIR fails as an

31
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 informational document, and fails to comply with procedural mandates of CEQA. There

2 are unanalyzed potentially significant impacts.

3 82. The EIR's analysis of potential impacts of the project was based on
4 inaccurate, unexplained, and out-of-date information and assumptions. Those

5 assumptions led to incorrect conclusions about potential impacts, including

6 underestimations of the potentially significant impacts. The EIR's underestimations of

7 the impacts meant that the true impacts were not disclosed, adequately analyzed and

8 mitigated. Cumulative impacts were not adequately disclosed or mitigated.

9 83. The EIR incorrectly characterized the current baseline, and did not do an

10 adequate factual investigation. The EIR preparer failed to obtain information that was

11 available and in the possession of MPUSD and that should have been used in the EIR
12 analysis. The EIR used terms that it did not define, which led to uncertainty, confusion,

13 and underestimation of impacts.

14 84. The EIR omissions violate informational mandates. "[F]ailure to comply

15 with the law subverts the purposes of CEQA if it omits material necessary to informed
16 decision making and informed public participation. Case law is clear that, in such

17 cases, the error is prejudicial." (Sunnyvale West Neighborhood Association v. City of

18 Sunnyvale City Council (2010) 190 Cal.App.4th 1351, 1392.)

19 85. Many of the responses to comments on the Draft EIR were not consistent

20 with CEQA's mandates. For example, DEIR Noise Mitigation Measure 3.11-3 states

21 that MPUSD would "prohibit use of the public address system when it is not specifically
22 necessary for a game, event, or other activity." The DEIR provided three very general

23 examples of "necessary" that "shall be allowed," and one example of "not necessary."

24 As presented, the mitigation is vague, ambiguous, and would vest unfettered discretion

25 in unnamed individuals with no accountability, and thus is not effective. A commenter

26 pointed out that these descriptions were vague and asked how the terms "specifically
27 necessary," "necessary" and "not necessary" would be defined, who would interpret

28 whether something was necessary or not, on what basis, and how that would be

32
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 enforced. In response, the Final EIR did not identify any enforcement mechanisms. As

2 another example, the City of Monterey commented that "Logan Lane is a very narrow

3 street" and the City asked for "an exhibit that shows the circulation within the parking

4 area and connections to Logan Lane and Martin Street." (Comment A2-3.). The Final

5 EIR did not provide the requested exhibit and information. Rather, the Final EIR said

6 this: "MPUSD understands that this question concerns traffic after construction of the

7 proposed project" and that "MPUSD will work coordinate [sic] with the city on how best

8 to direct game traffic to lessen traffic on Logan Lane." The response was not adopted

9 as a mitigation, and is an impermissible deferral of mitigation, and does not contain

10 performance standards. The response failed to address the impacts of circulation

11 during the 16+-month construction period of the Stadium and Field Project.

12 86. The adopted mitigation monitoring and reporting program (MMRP) was

13 materially deficient. As one example, Mitigation measure 3.11-3 is intended to minimize

14 noise levels of events at the stadium, and the "goals of this mitigation are to prevent

15 nearby residences from being exposed to noise levels that exceed the City's L02, L08,

16 and Leq standards." The mitigation is inadequate because it fails to ensure any

17 requirement for MPUSD to monitor the actual event noise either when the event is

18 happening or at any other time. "Goals" are not the performance standards that CEQA

19 requires, and the MMRP does not include any actual measurement of noise impacts to

20 determine whether the "goals" are bring met or exceeded. It is unreasonable to ask

21 residents to monitor the noise because the cost for monitoring the noise levels from a

22 single game using simpler equipment is estimated at $5,800.

23 87. The statement of overriding considerations did not address any overriding

24 need for the noise and lighting impacts and were not supported by substantial evidence.

25 The "overriding considerations" focused on the desire for additional space for athletic

26 practices and games. The construction of the multi-sport field would meet that need

27 and would avoid the installation of stadium lighting and stadium public address system,

28 which would then avoid most if not all of the significant and unmitigated impacts.

2 and as shown in the record of proceedings herein, including but not limited to the failure

5 that Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law, did not satisfy the

11 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION: CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT -

12 PARKING PROJECT (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085; 1094.5)

13 90. Petitioners and plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate by reference

14 paragraphs 1 through 89 above, and paragraphs 91 through 122 below, as though fully

15 set forth herein, and further allege as follows.

16 91. Starting in late 2019, following the public comments with regard to the

17 parking impacts that would be caused by the Stadium and Field Project, MPUSD started
18 to develop plans for its Parking Project at the shared high school/district office site.
19 MPUSD spent more than $250,000 on the Parking Project, working with C2G

20 Engineers, RGM project managers, and Verde Design architects.

21 92. On September 23, 2020, MPUSD received approvals from the Division of

22 State Architect for the Parking Project. The approved Parking Project plans contain four

23 designated parking areas, labeled Areas 1 through 4. The Parking Project would

24 materially increase the total amount of land dedicated to parking in the four areas and

25 would result in a net addition of 75 parking stalls. The Parking Project is a project under

26 CEQA.

27 93. MPUSD acted to approve the Parking Project when on or before June 16,
28 2021, MPUSD staff directed the demolition of Parking Area 1B which caused

34
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 irreversible physical changes to the site, and again when on June 22, 2021 the MPUSD

2 board acted to approve the Parking Project 1 Area 1 construction, and again when on July

3 27, 2021 the board acted to approve a large part of the Area 3 and all of Area 4 or the

4 Parking Project. Under CEQA, a project approval is "The decision by a public agency

5 which commits the agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project." (CEQA

6 Guidelines, § 15352(a).) MPUSD failed to perform prior CEQA review for its approvals

7 of the Parking Project and MPUSD did not make its approvals contingent on future

8 CEQA compliance. The MPUSD board and senior officials have publicly stated their

9 support for the parking construction and parking project. As of late August 2021 the

10 Parking Area 1 is being completely reconstructed in a different layout and features and

11 the construction is still under way.

12 94. The ongoing Parking Project Area 1 construction parking has harmed and

13 is harming historic Carmel stone walls. Relief is sought and is appropriate because the

14 remaining stone walls can and should be restored and preserved. The construction of

15 Parking Project Area 3 would harm historic resources. No historic resources evaluation

16 has been performed for the Parking Project or for any of the Areas 1 through 4.

17 95. Respondents' actions, and each of them, as described above and below

18 and as shown in the record of proceedings herein, including but not limited to the failure

19 to prepare an adequate environmental document in compliance with the provisions of

20 the California Environmental Quality Act, did not satisfy the procedural and substantive

21 requirements of CEQA, did not engage in a legally sufficient fact-finding endeavor, did
22 not meet the informational requirements of CEQA, and did not adequately identify and

23 mitigate impacts prior to approval of the Parking Project. MPUSD's actions, and each of

24 them, constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that Respondent has failed to

25 proceed in a manner required by law, did not adopt requisite findings, and/or its
26 decisions and findings are not supported by substantial evidence.

6 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION: CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT -

7 LOGAN LANE DRIVEWAY WIDENING PROJECT (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085; 1094.5)

8 98. Petitioners and plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate by reference

9 paragraphs 1 through 97 above, and paragraphs 99 through 122 below, as though fully

10 set forth herein, and further allege as follows.

11 99. The widening of the school access driveway on Logan Lane is a project

12 under CEQA. MPUSD would carry out the project and MPUSD is the lead agency.
13 MPUSD did not have a hearing or otherwise publicly consider and decide to proceed

14 with the widening of its Logan Lane driveway.

15 100. MPUSD plans to use its driveway as the primary construction access to

16 the Stadium and Field Project. That construction project would take more than a year

17 and would require wide loads, heavy trucks, and dozens of construction workers on a

18 daily basis. MPUSD needs to widen the driveway which is a single-lane sloped

19 driveway that is uneven and narrows to 10.5 feet wide. The driveway is limited on one

20 side by a drop off to Logan Lane and on the other by a utility pole.

21 101. MPUSD's action on April 27, 2021 to apply for an encroachment permit
22 from the City of Monterey to widen the Logan Lane driveway was an approval of the

23 project under CEQA in light of the surrounding circumstances. MPUSD spent money on

24 preparing the plans and making the application. MPUSD did not prepare CEQA review

25 prior to approving the project. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis

26 allege, that MPUSD has not withdrawn its permit application from the City of Monterey.

27 102. Respondent MPUSD failed to comply with CEQA prior to MPUSD's
28 approval of the Logan Lane Driveway Widening Project because MPUSD failed to adopt

36
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 sufficient and legally supportable findings, failed to adopt a legally sufficient mitigation

2 and monitoring reporting program, and failed to prepare an adequate environmental

3 document. MPUSD's actions, and each of them, constitutes a prejudicial abuse of

4 discretion in that MPUSD has failed to proceed in a manner required by law, it did not

5 adopt requisite findings, and/or its decisions and findings are not supported by

6 substantial evidence.

7 103. MPUSD did not file a notice of exemption and this action is timely.

8 104. Wherefore, Petitioners pray for relief as described below.

9

10 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION: GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION 53094

11 (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5, including California Environmental Quality Act)

12 105. Petitioners and plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate by reference

13 paragraphs 1 through 104 above, and 106 through 122 below, as though fully set forth

14 herein, and further allege as follows.

15 106. Government Code section 53091(a) requires that a local school district

16 "shall comply with all applicable building ordinances and zoning ordinances of the

17 county or city in which the territory of the local agency is situated." Government Code

18 section 53094 states a specific limited exception: a school district "may render a city or

19 county zoning ordinance inapplicable to a proposed use of property by the school

20 district. The governing board of the school district may not take this action when the

21 proposed use of the property by the school district is for nonclassroom facilities,

22 including, but not limited to, warehouses, administrative buildings, and automotive

23 storage and repair buildings." Here, MPUSD has sought to exempt its nonclassroom

24 facilities from city zoning and General Plan mandates and MPUSD's action is

25 inconsistent with the limits of section 53094.

26 107. The EIR in this case and the July 27, 2021 MPUSD resolutions show that

27 Stadium and Field Project involves nonclassroom facilities because the MPUSD project

28

37
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 objectives emphasize the primary project focus on "after-school," "extracurricular,"

2 "nighttime," and "spectator" events. The three EIR project objectives were as follows:

3 "Improve on-campus athletic facilities at Monterey High School for athlete

4 practice and games to enhance opportunities for after-school athletic and

5 extracurricular activities for students."

6 "Facilitate night-time athletic events and practices at the Dan Albert
Stadium."
7

8 "Provide adequate visitor seating separated from the home team seating
area at the Dan Albert Stadium." The claim was this would cause "a better
9 game experience for all attendees" and "spectators."

10 108. Athletic stadiums are not exempt from zoning ordinances under section
11 53094. The MPUSD project includes the new installation of permanent lighting and a
12 public address system in an athletic stadium, along with new visitors' bleachers and a
13 press box. The MPUSD project does not involve the replacement of existing tall lighting
14 fixtures on a sports field.

15 109. The blanket exemption for "all projects paid for by Measure and Measure
16 P" iS not proper under section 53094. Section 53094 expressly prohibits a school

17 district from exempting nonclassroom facilities from the local zoning codes . The
18 proposed MPUSD project includes nonclassroom facilities. The Stadium and Field
19 Project would add spectator-oriented features that are specifically designed to attract
20 and accommodate spectators and nighttime games against other school teams. These
21 facilities include aluminum bleachers for visiting team fans, a press box, a public
22 address system, and nighttime lighting. The parking facilities are designed to
23 accommodate parking for the new Stadium and Field uses to replace in part the parking
24 capacity lost by conversion of the lower field and the increased demand due to the
25 increased stadium capacity specifically for visiting team fans. The parking lots are
26 nonclassroom facilities that would be used for events outside of the school day, for
27 spectacle and entertainment. The Parking Project was not included in the Exemption
28 Action. The science building "change order" that added and approved Parking Project

38
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 Area 1 was approved by the school board months after, and was not included in, the

2 Exemption Action. The historic Carmel stone walls that are being and would be further

3 harmed by the projects are nonclassroom facilities.

4 110. MPUSD's blanket exemption is overbroad because it purports to apply to

5 multiple unnamed projects of all kinds now and in the future, including unnamed and

6 unspecified "proposed" projects and uses, which is not consistent with section 53094

7 and the statutory scheme.

8 111. At the time the MPUSD board adopted the exemption, the board had not

9 approved the Stadium and Field Project. This challenge became timely no sooner than

10 the date that MPUSD approved the project because only then was it applied to an

11 actual approved project. It vould have been premature for plaintiffs to present a

12 challenge earlier because MPUSD could have decided not to approve the Stadium and

13 Field Project or to abandon or modify the project. The exemption as applied to the

14 Stadium and Field Project, the Parking Project, and the Logan Lane Driveway Widening

15 Project was arbitrary and capricious, unsupported and outside MPUSD's legal authority.

16 112. Petitioners challenge and seek to set aside and render null and void the

17 resolution adopted by the MPUSD Board for the April 23, 2021 Exemption Action as

18 applied and facially on the following bases:

19 a) As applied to the Stadium and Field Project: The proposed
20 spectator-oriented "after-school," "extracurricular," "nighttime events," and "visitor" uses,

21 including the visitor stadium bleachers, football lighting, press box, field bleachers, and
22 other features, are nonclassroom facilities under Government Code section 53094.

23 b) As applied to the Parking Project: The proposed new and
24 reconstructed parking lots are nonclassroom facilities under Government Code section

25 53094. The reconfigured and bigger parking lots are intended to provide parking for the
26 spectator-oriented sports uses of the Stadium and Field Project, and include two new

27 parking lots for the administrative office, according to MPUSD. "Nonclassroom facilities"

28

39
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 including "administrative buildings" are not subject to exemption under the express

2 language of section 53094, and parking lots for administrative buildings are not exempt.

3 c) As applied to the Logan Lane Widening Project: The driveway is a
4 nonclassroom facility under Government Code section 53094. The widening is intended

5 to accommodate the construction of the Stadium and Field Project and its
6 spectator-oriented events.

7 c) MPUSD's attempted exemption of multiple whole school site projects

8 violates the provisions of Government Code section 53094 which does not allow
9 exemption of "nonclassroom facilities." Application of the purported exemption to all

10 projects which may or may not be public knowledge for six school sites, each of which

11 may contain one or more "nonclassroom" project elements, and particularly for the

12 Monterey High School site and the Stadium and Field Project and the Parking Project

13 that had not yet been adequately disclosed and had not been approved as of the date of

14 the board's Exemption Action, makes the adoption and application of the Exemption

15 Action unlawfully overbroad and not in compliance with the Government Code.

16 e) Facially: MPUSD did not make, consider, or adopt a determination or

17 finding with regards to compliance with CEQA for the April 23, 2021 Exemption Action.

18 The Exemption Action is a project and is not exempt from CEQA. Even if there were a

19 determination by MPUSD, any determination that there can be no possible adverse

20 environmental impact under CEQA by the adoption or implementation of the Exemption

21 Action is not supported by the record before MPUSD.

22 113. Petitioners are beneficially interested in the issuance of a declaration of

23 law and injunction by virtue of the facts and law set forth herein. Petitioners and

24 plaintiffs have no plain, speedy and adequate legal remedy other than the relief sought

25 in this action. Petitioners and plaintiffs have a clear, present and beneficial right to the
26 determination as to whether the facilities identified below at the Monterey High
27 School/MPUSD site have been properly exempted from the city zoning codes.

1 114. For the foregoing reasons, by adoption of the resolution for the Exemption

2 Action, MPUSD has failed to proceed in a manner required by law, the decision(s), and

3 finding(s), and/or purpose relating to MPUSD's Exemption Action are arbitrary and

4 capricious and/or are not supported by the substantial evidence, has not complied with

5 CEQA, and has not adopted required findings as required by law.. A peremptory writ of

6 mandamus is requested to be issued by this Court remanding and ordering MPUSD to

7 rescind the resolution made for the Exemption Action, and proceed according to law or

8 as otherwise proven and ordered after trial or hearing on this matter.

9 115. Wherefore, Petitioners pray for relief as described below.

10

11 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF LOCAL ZONING ORDINANCE

12 (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5, including California Environmental Quality Act)
13 116. Petitioners and plaintiffs hereby reallege and incorporate by reference

14 paragraphs 1 through 115 above, and 117 through 122 below, as though fully set forth

15 herein, and further allege as follows.

16 117. Several of the the Stadium and Field Project elements are not exempt

17 from city zoning code and general plan requirement, and the MPUSD effort to exempt

18 them under California Government Code section 53094 is invalid and of no legal effect.

19 118. The District, by approve the Stadium and Field Project by violating zoning
20 ordinances and/or general plan land use restrictions to allow development of tall

21 structures and intense nighttime lighted areas, wedged into, alongside, below and
22 above historically dark and quiet neighborhoods that include senior low-income housing

23 constructed by the City of Monterey, two adjacent designated historic structures, the

24 Lou Henry Hoover House and the Old Monterey Inn on Martin Street, and hundreds of
25 single-family detached residential homes, is overall not consistent with the purposes,

26 policies and/or goals of the adopted and applicable zoning and general plan.

27 119. The Stadium and Field Project is located within a large area zoned R-1 by

28 the City of Monterey. The R-1 zone allows a maximum structure height of 25 feet. The

41
PRESERVING THE PEACE, TAXPAYERS FOR MPUSD ACCOUNTABILITY VERIFIED PETITION
V. MONTEREY PENINSULA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21CV002755

1 Stadium and Field Project with its proposed stadium light poles contains new stadium

2 light poles to be constructed in substantial excess of the 25-foot height restriction limit,

3 in violation of local law, land use and planning principles which are designed to protect

4 quality of life, consistency of neighborhoods, and are conditions and restrictions which

5 persons such as petitioners and their members reasonably rely for protection of

6 environmental, community, property and quality of life values.

7 120. Respondents EIR found that noise generated by evening activities at the

8 stadium and daytime activities at the lower field would expose residents to noise levels

9 that are substantially louder than existing conditions and that exceed City noise

10 standards. The City has not approved a violation of its noise limits.

11 121. The Stadium and Field Project, the Parking Project, and the Logan Lane

12 Driveway Widening are not exempt from city review. The EIR failed to identify the City

13 as a responsible agency under CEQA. The proposed heights, noises, and other uses

14 would exceed the limits allowed by the City regulations and the City has not given
15 permits for the uses over which it has authority. Petitioners are beneficially interested in

16 the issuance of a declaration of law and injunction by virtue of the facts and law set forth

17 herein. Petitioners have no plain, speedy and adequate legal remedy other than the

18 relief sought in this action. Petitioners have a clear, present and beneficial right to the

19 determination as to whether the facilities identified below at the Monterey High

20 School/MPUSD site have been properly exempted from the city zoning codes. MPUSD

21 has a plain, clear and ministerial duty to comply with the City's zoning and building
22 ordinances, including with regard to noise, lighting, historic resources, traffic, grading,

23 erosion, drainage and roads, and its failure to comply with the City's zoning and building
24 ordinances is arbitrary and capricious. Therefore, Petitioner is entitled to a writ of

25 mandate compelling the District to comply with City's zoning ordinances.

26 122. By approving the Stadium and Field Project and Parking Project with

27 direct conflicts with important laws, policies, goals and directives of the City of

28

1 Monterey's zoning code and general plan, MPUSD has failed to proceed in a manner

2 required by law.
