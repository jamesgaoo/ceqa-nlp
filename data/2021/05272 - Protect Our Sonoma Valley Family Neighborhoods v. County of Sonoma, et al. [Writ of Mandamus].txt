Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 Petitioner alleges:

2 Introduction

3 1. Protect Our Sonoma Valley Family Neighborhoods, ("Family
4

5 Neighborhoods", hereafter) an unincorporated association, brings this mandamus
action in the public interest to enforce the California Environmental Quality Act

7 (CEQA) and Sonoma County Code. Family Neighborhoods challenge Sonoma

8 County's adoption of an inadequate and incomplete Negative Declaration and
9

10 approval of a Cannabis Dispensary Project that violates Sonoma County Code Section

11 26-88-256, specifically formulated to limit Cannabis Dispensary Uses; Section 26-88-256

12 subd. (f)(1), regarding specific Location Requirements; and Section 26-88-256 subd. 11,

13 referencing Section 26-86-010, regarding Required Parking; and also poses potentially
14 significant impacts that have not been divulged or mitigated. 15

16 The County Code's Location Requirements state "A cannabis dispensary shall

17 not be established on any parcel containing a dwelling unit used as a residence, nor

18 within one hundred feet (100') of a residential zoning district." The proposed Cannabis
19 Dispensary Project is surrounded by residential uses and is admittedly situated too
20

21 close to several nearby residences. 187 residences surround the project site, including 5

22 residences and a 122-unit apartment complex that are situated within 100' of the

23 Project. (See Figure 1 [This is a page from Family Neighbors' Powerpoint presentation

24 submitted to the County that will be be lodged with this Court as part of the
25

26 administrative record of proceedings].)

27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 2

1 Members of Family Neighborhoods, Valley of the Moon Alliance (VOTMA), and

2 other concerned residents expressed throughout the public hearing process that the

3 Cannabis Dispensary Project violates the County's parking and residential set-back
4

5 requirements for cannabis dispensaries and is inappropriately sited in a residential

6 community without adequate separators to warrant a waiver of the 100' setback

7 provision. The County failed to apply the correct code provision and undervalued the

8 number of required parking places. This deficit also renders a potentially significant
9

10 impact under CEQA because the County's Guidelines for Traffic Impact Studies,

11 provides that a "significant traffic impact" exists where the "proposed on-site parking

12 supply does not meet County standards and does not adequately accommodate

13 parking demand."

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 3

1 The County's approval of the Cannabis Dispensary Project also constitutes a

2 violation of CEQA. The County adopted a Negative Declaration where there is

3 substantial evidence in the whole record that supports the requisite "fair argument" of
4

5 potentially significant impacts that trigger preparation of an EIR.
CEQA mandates that when fact-based opinions of citizens present a 'fair

7 argument' that a proposed discretionary project may have a significant environmental

8 impact, an agency must conduct an EIR process to inform its land use discretion
9

10 regardless of contrary expert opinion.

11 The fair argument standard applies to the issue of whether an EIR must be

12 prepared. As a matter of law "an EIR is required 'whenever it can be fairly argued on

13 the basis of substantial evidence that [a] project may have significant environmental
14

15 impact.' [citation]." (Friends of the San Mateo Gardens v. San Mateo Community College

16 District (2016) 1 Cal. 5th 937, 957, 959 "Gardens I"; Pub. Resources Code §§ 21082.2(a),

17 21100, 21151; Guidelines, §15064(f)(1); No Oil v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, at

18 75; Communities for a Better Environment v. California Resources Agency (2002) 103
19 Cal.App.4th 98, 111-112; The Pocket Protectors v. City of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App.4 903.)
20

21 "May" means a reasonable possibility. (League for Protection of Oakland's Architectural

22 Resources U. City of Oakland (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 896, 904-905; Sundstrom v. County of

23 Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296, at 309.)

24 Here, numerous residents, Family Neighborhoods, and Valley of the Moon
25

26 Alliance (VOTMA) submitted credible evidence that the Cannabis Dispensary Project

27 may have direct, indirect, and/ or cumulatively significant environmental impact to,

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 4

1 inter alia: parking, traffic, pedestrian safety, and inconsistency with area plans, such

2 that the County must conduct an EIR process to analyze environmental impacts and

3 identify feasible mitigations and alternatives.
4

5 Family Neighborhoods thus respectfully asks for this Court's peremptory writ to
order the County to rescind the Cannabis Dispensary Project approvals and

7 entitlements and to conduct an EIR process to inform its review of the Cannabis

8 Dispensary Project.

Jurisdiction
10

11 2. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code section 21168 and

12 CCP section 1094.5. The parties and site are located in the County of Sonoma.

13 Parties

14
3. Petitioner, Protect Our Sonoma Valley Family Neighborhoods is an
15

16 unincorporated association formed in the public interest in April of 2021. Family

17 Neighborhoods' purpose is to protect the quality and character of Sonoma Valley's

18 neighborhoods and to ensure that new development is compliant with the County's
19 code requirements. Members of Family Neighborhoods include community residents
20

21 and concerned citizens who enjoy and appreciate the environmental resources of Glen

22 Ellen and their environs. Family Neighborhoods brings this petition on behalf of all

23 others similarly situated that are too numerous to be named and brought before this

24 Court as petitioners. Paul Morrison is a member a of Family Neighborhoods and objected
25

26 to the County's approval of the Cannabis Dispensary project.

27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 5

1 4. Respondents, the County of Sonoma and its Board of Supervisors

2 (collectively, the County) are the governmental bodies that approved the Cannabis

3 Dispensary Project and acted as lead agency under CEQA.
4
5.
5 Real Party in Interest, John Lobrow, 708 Gravenstein Hwy N. #287,
Sebastopol, CA, is the applicant for the Cannabis Dispensary Project as named in the

7 Notice of Determination.

8 6. Does 1 to 10 are fictitiously named real parties in interest whose true
9

10 names and capacities are currently unknown to Family Neighborhoods. If and when

11 their true names and capacities are known, Family Neighborhoods will amend this

12 petition to assert them.

13 7. The paragraphs below refer to and rely on information in documents
14

15 relating to this action, all of which will be filed with this Court as part of the record of

16 proceedings and are here incorporated by reference.

17 General Allegations

18 8. The Project is referred to as UPC17-0094 Loe Firehouse Cannabis
19 Dispensary ("Cannabis Dispensary", hereafter.) The Project proposes a cannabis
20

21 dispensary in an existing 3,847-square-foot building. Storefront dispensary services will

22 be available during regular hours of operation 7:00 am to 7:00 pm Monday through

23 Saturday; closed Sunday. The applicant estimates that an average of 150 patrons per

24 day will visit the dispensary. Delivery service trips would occur twice each day. The
25

26 operation will have five employees on-site per shift, including delivery drivers. Parking

27 for the operation will be provided on-site in two separate lots - a customer lot accessed

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 6

1 from Arnold Drive with 12 parking spaces, including one van accessible space, and an

2 employee lot accessed from Madrone Road with 4 legal spaces plus 1 tandem space,

3 including one van accessible space. Construction activities for the project are estimated
4

5 to be minimal, consisting of internal tenant improvements to reconfigure the first floor
for retail and security operations, and convert the second-floor residence to employee

7 support space (office(s), break room, bathroom) and product storage space, as needed.

8 It is estimated that substantial changes will not be made to the external building
9

10 besides signage, lighting, and accessibility improvements that may be required. No

11 new landscaping is proposed.

12 9. The Project site is located at 15499 Arnold Drive, at the intersection of

13 Arnold Drive and Madrone Road, in an unincorporated, residential area of Sonoma
14

15 County, approximately 1.75 miles south of the community of Glen Ellen and about 3

16 miles northwest of the City of Sonoma. The 0.33-acre parcel is located in a small cluster

17 of three commercially zoned parcels, and is developed with an existing 3,847-square-

18 foot commercial building. The building was originally constructed as a fire station with
19 a second-floor residence added in 1985. The first floor was converted to office space in
20

21 2004. Primary site access and all existing office access is from Arnold Drive on the west

22 side of the property. A secondary access for employees and deliveries is present on

23 Madrone Road on the south side of the property.

24 10. The General Plan Land Use Designation on the parcel is Limited
25

26 Commercial (LC). Zoning on the parcel is Limited Commercial (LC), Scenic Resources

27 Arnold Drive Scenic Corridor (SR), Valley Oak Habitat (VOH). The surrounding area is

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 7

1 largely residential, located in central Sonoma Valley between the community of Glen

2 Ellen and the City of Sonoma. The two adjacent parcels are also Limited Commercial

3 (LC): an art gallery and residence to the north and Rancho Market and Deli to the east.
4

5 Surrounding parcels are zoned residential, consisting of High Density Residential (R3)
apartments to the north and east, and Low Density Residential (R1) and Rural

7 Residential (RR) single family dwellings to the south and west.

8 11. A Negative Declaration ("ND") was prepared for the Project in February,
9

10 2021, and was posted and made available for agency and public review. The ND

11 claimed that the Project proposed no substantial environmental impacts and proposed

12 no mitigation.

13 12. In March and April 2021, concerned area residents, including the Valley of
14 the Moon Alliance (VOTMA), registered their objections to the Board of Zoning
15

16 Adjustments stating that the Project did not comply with the County's Code provisions

17 regarding required parking and 100' residential setbacks; physical separators were

18 inadequate; the Negative Declaration was inadequate and incomplete; reasonably
19 expected future projects were not included in the cumulative impacts analysis; and
20

21 I potentially significant impacts due to inconsistency with area plans and potentially

22 significant impacts to parking, traffic, and pedestrian safety had not been adequately

23 considered.

24 Residents explained to the County Planner that the Project provides only 16
25

26 parking spaces, instead of the required 26 spaces. The calculation of parking spaces

27 should have been based upon the "gross floor area" instead of carving out non-retail

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 8

1 space to lessen the number of required parking places. Residents stated that providing

2 only 16 spaces rendered a significant 10 space parking deficit that will result in

3 environmental impacts. The Project's proposal of providing only 4 legal parking spaces
4

5 for employee parking also did not meet the minimum employee parking requirement

6 of 5 spaces.

7 13. On April 8, 2021, the Board of Zoning Adjustments ("BZA") held a public

8 hearing on the Negative Declaration and the Project and heard and received testimony
9

10 and evidence presented orally or in writing. The BZA adopted the ND and approved

11 the Use Permit for Resolution #21-0377, subject to Conditions of Approval. Residents

12 reiterated their objections and concerns.

13 14. On April 19, 2021, Paul Morrison on behalf of Protect our Sonoma Valley
14
Family Neighborhoods appealed the decision of the BZA to the Board, raising issues
15

16 related to: Sonoma County Code inconsistencies and violations; an inadequate and

17 incomplete Negative Declaration; an incomplete Project description and noticing

18 errors; an inadequate traffic impacts analysis; evidence of direct and cumulatively
19 considerable traffic impacts; and neighborhood incompatibility. Resident, Sharon
20

21 Church, stated that the Project proposed too many unmitigated impacts and requested

22 an EIR be prepared.

23 15. In early September, prior to the Board of Supervisor's hearing, Haroche

24 Law submitted a follow up letter detailing Family Neighborhoods' objections.
25

26 Attorney Bob Haroche submitted photographic evidence and explained that there were

27 insufficient physical barriers to warrant a waiver of the 100' separator from residences.

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 9

1 The traffic study was also deficient because the ND failed to discuss, much less

2 evaluate, the cumulative impacts of the Project in light of "past, present, and probable

3 future projects producing related or cumulative impacts." Future projects include
4

5 those "of which the lead agency has knowledge, but for which no current plans have

6 been submitted for review, so long as they are not unduly speculative."

7 VOTMA stated that neither the traffic studies nor the Initial Study /ND

8 addressed the Project's proximity to the existing Sonoma Development Center [SDC],
9

10 located approximately ½ mile to the north of the Project. The SDC is widely known to

11 be a current major redevelopment project in Sonoma County and is actively in the

12 planning process with County officials. The SDC redevelopment project must be

13 considered in the context of cumulative area traffic and other impacts. The traffic
14 volumes at Madrone and Arnold Drive in the W-Trans TIS almost certainly
15

16 understated the expected / anticipated future conditions once the SDC has been

17 revitalized. The IS/ND ignored the future traffic effect when assessing 2040 "Future

18 Conditions." Haroche noted that the IS/ND made no mention of and failed to include

19 any analysis for the Sonoma Developmental Center reutilization project, which is
20

21 estimated to include over one million usable square feet.

22 Haroche further noted that neither the traffic study nor the staff report discuss

23 much less evaluate three upcoming cannabis dispensaries in Sonoma Valley: (1) the

24 Sparc dispensary opening at 19315 Sonoma Hwy, City of Sonoma (approved May 13,
25

26 2021, now under construction); (2) the Haight Street dispensary (applicant John Lobro)

27 at 15 Fremont Drive, unincorporated county (UPC 18-0023, now undergoing planning

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 10

1 review); and (3) the Sonoma Finest 2.0 dispensary at 8910 Highway 12, Kenwood (UPC

2 19-0006).

3 16. On September 14, 2021, the Board held a public hearing on the Appeal,
4

5 Negative Declaration, and the Project. At the conclusion of public testimony, the Board
denied the Appeal, adopted the Negative Declaration, and approved the Proposed

7 Project with conditions of approval. Residents and Family Neighborhoods objected to

8 the Negative Declaration and the Project on the bases stated.
9
17.
10 The County filed a Notice of Determination on September 20, 2021 stating

11 that no mitigation measures were adopted for the Project. This action is timely filed

12 within 30 days of October 21, 2021.

13 18. Family Neighborhoods will serve a copy of this Petition on the Attorney
14
General.
15

16 19. Family Neighborhoods have no adequate remedy at law. Absent the relief

17 prayed for in this Petition, the project will proceed with significant irreparable and

18 irreversible environmental impacts to the Sonoma Valley environment and residents.
19 The County has the ability to correct its violations of law but has failed and refused to
20

21 do so.

22 I. Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act

23 20. Family Neighborhoods incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set

24 forth.
25

26

27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 11

1 21. The County abused its discretion and failed to act in the manner required

2 by law in approving the Cannabis Dispensary Project based on a Negative Declaration.

3 According to proof following certification of the record of proceedings:
4

a.
5 The County unlawfully approved a project with potentially significant
environmental impacts without preparing an EIR to inform its discretion.

7 The record contains substantial evidence supporting a fair argument of

8 potentially significant environmental impacts, including, inter alia, site-
9

10 specific and cumulative impacts relating to traffic, parking, pedestrian

11 safety, and inconsistencies with the City's adopted land use plans and

12 policies, among other impacts supported by evidence in the administrative

13 record. The ND also failed to provide and notice an accurate Project
14
description.
15

16 b. The County's findings are not supported by substantial evidence.

17 II. Violations of the Sonoma County Code

18 22. Petitioner incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.
19 23. The County violated Sonoma County Code Sec. 26-86-010 - Required
20

21 Parking, which provides "all uses permitted in Chapter 26 of the Sonoma County Code

22 shall provide on-site parking according to the following formulas.

23 Medical Cannabis Dispensary: 2 spaces, including at least 1 van-accessible

24 space; plus 1 additional space for every 200 square feet of gross floor area, plus
25

26 additional space for each employee on maximum shift; but in no case less than 5

27 off-street parking spaces.

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 12

1 Sonoma Code Section 26-88-256 subd. (g) (11) confirms that the County's parking

2 provisions are mandatory.

3

4 (g) Operating Standards. The following are the minimum development criteria

5 and operational standards applicable to any cannabis dispensary use: (11)
Parking must meet the requirements of Section 26-86-010.
7

8 a. County staff failed to use the cannabis dispensary gross floor area of 3,847
9

10 square feet to calculate the Project's parking requirements and instead

11 arbitrarily interpreted the code to leave out approximately 50% of the

12 nonpublic portion of the building. Under this erroneous methodology, the

13 County only required 16 legal parking spaces, instead of the 26 spaces that are
14 required under the code.
15

16 b. County Code Section 26-04-020 P. 1. also defines "parking spaces" as

17 "usable off-street area with independent access." Here, parking spaces 16 and

18 17 are in tandem, rendering the interior space #16 non-accessible and

19 therefore not a valid parking space. The Project's parking configuration is
20

21 further deficient in that it depicts 16 spaces as 9 x 18 feet, contrary to code

22 requirement that they be 9 X 20 feet.

23 24. The County violated Sonoma County Code Section 26-88-256 subd. (f) that

24 mandates the following property setbacks for cannabis dispensaries:
25

26 Property setbacks for cannabis dispensaries shall be measured in straight line

27 from the property line of the protected site to the closest property line of the

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 13

1 parcel with the cannabis dispensary. 1) A cannabis dispensary shall not be

2 established on any parcel containing a dwelling unit used as a residence, nor
3 within one hundred feet (100') of a residential zoning district.
4

a.
5 The Cannabis Dispensary Project is acknowledged to be located closer than
100' feet from several residences and there is insufficient physical separation

7 between land uses to ensure off-site impacts will not occur.

8 b. The County's application of a waiver to the 100' setback, under Section 26-88-
9

10 256 subd. (f)(4) of the County Code, is not supported by substantial evidence.

11

12 WHEREFORE, Friends pray:

13 1. That the Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the County to
14
set aside and void all approvals relating to the Cannabis Dispensary Project and to
15

16 refrain from further consideration of the Project until it fully complies with CEQA by

17 preparing an adequate EIR and adopting feasible alternatives and mitigation measures;

18 2. That the Court enjoin the County and Real Party in Interest and their
19 employees and agents from all construction and pre-construction activities, such as
20

21 grading and tree removal, relating to the Cannabis Dispensary Project while this

22 petition is pending;

23 3. For Protect Our Sonoma Valley Family Neighborhoods' costs and attorney

24 fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5; and
25
4.
26 For other and further relief as the Court finds proper.
