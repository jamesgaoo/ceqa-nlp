24 Alliance ("Petitioner" or "GSEJA") brings this action on its own behalf, on behalf of its
25 members, and on behalf of the general public to enforce the California Environmental Quality

26 Act ("CEQA"), and alleges as follows:

27 I. INTRODUCTION

28 1. This Petition concerns the IDI Logistics Center Buildings 2 and 4 and the Perris
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)

•'

-

2 Valley Storm Drain Channel Improvements ("the Project"'), by which applicants IDI Logistics,

3 LLC and Does I-XX would construct two high-cube warchouses totaling up to 1,352,736 square

4 feet and and either the City of Perris or the applicants would deepen and widen the Perris Valley

5 Storm Drain (PVSD") Channel and replace the Rider Street bridge over the PVSD Channel.

6 The site of the two buildings totals approximately 65 net acres; the EIR does not specify the

7 overall size of the Project.

2.
8 The City's Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Project conceded that

9 there would be what the EIR termed a "significant and unavoidable" impacts with respect to Air

10 Quality and Greenhouse Gases ("GHGs"), but the City's Statement of Overriding Considerations

11 justifying those impacts was not based on substantial evidence. The City also failed to

12 acknowledge other significant impacts with respect to Agricultural Resources, Air Quality,

13 Biological Resources, Energy, and Greenhouse Gases, and the City and Planning Commission

14 engaged in numerous other failures under CEQA as detailed in this Petition.

3.
15 Petitioner, Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance ("Petitioner" or

16 "GSEJA"), brings this action on its own behalf and on behalf of the general public as a private

17 attorney general in order to challenge the approvals at issue in this case.

4.
18 The City of Perris filed a Notice of Determination ("NOD") with the State Office

19 of Planning and Research after its Planning Commission granted the requested Project approvals.

20 Normally, under the Public Resources Code and Governor Newsom's Executive Orders N-54-20

21 and N-80-20, the filing of an NOD with the Office of Planning and Research (and the completion

22 of several other steps, which Petitioner is unsure the City took) would commence the running of
a 30-day
23 statute of limitations under Public Resources Code section 21 167(c). In this case, the

24 City's NOD is likely a nullity because Petitioner has appealed the Planning Commission's

25 approvals to the City Council pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21151(c). Petitioner

26 nevertheless files the instant Petition in advance of the City Council's determination in order to

27 assure that its rights are preserved.

4.
28 Petitioner presently seeks to invalidate the following approvals by the Perris

II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
17
5. This Court has jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and
18
1094.5. The Court has jurisdiction of CEQA matters pursuant to Pub. Resources Code sections
19 21168, 21168.5, and 21168.9.
20 6. Venue is proper in this Court because the City of Perris is within the jurisdiction 21 of Riverside County and the Project is located here as well, so the actions giving rise to the
22 causes of action herein transpired in Riverside County. See Code of Civil Procedure sections
23 393 and 394.
24
7. This action is timely filed within the the arguable 30-day statute of limitations 25 pursuant to Pub. Res. Code section 21167.
26
8. Petitioner has exhausted its administrative remedies by commenting on the
27 Project repeatedly prior to the close of the public hearing on the Project before the filing of a 28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 3

+

1 final Notice of Determination, in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21177(b).
2 Petitioner's comments before the City Council are still pending.
3
9. Petitioner has complied with CEQA, Pub. Resources Code section 21167.5, by
4 filing and serving with this Petition for Writ of Mandate a Notice of Intent to File (a true and
correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A). Petitioner has complied with CEQA,
6 Pub. Resources Code section 21167.6, in notifying the City of Petitioner's election to prepare the
administrative record by serving and filing a Notice of Election herewith. Petitioner has
8 complied with CEQA's requirement that Petitioner notify the Attorney General of the
commencement of this action pursuant to Pub. Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of
10 Civil Procedure section 388; a copy of Petitioner's Notice to the Attorney General will be filed
11 along with the present Petition.
12
III. PARTIES
13
10. Petitioner GSEJA is an advocacy organization devoted to the preservation of the
14

15 environment as well as the promotion of safe and healthy communities. Constituents of GSEJA
reside in Riverside County and would be irreparably harmed by the Project's environmental
16 impacts. GSEJA submitted comments on the Project. GSEJA brings this action on behalf of the
17 public and is acting as a private attorney general conferring a significant benefit on the general
18 public or a large class of persons under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.
19 11. Respondent City of Perris ("City") is a public entity located in western Riverside
20 County and the lead agency for the Project under CEQA. City is the agency charged with the
21 authority of regulating and administering land use and development within its territory in
22 compliance with the provisions of its General Plan and zoning ordinances as well as applicable
23 provisions of state law including CEQA. As the lead agency for the Project, the City is charged
24 with the duty of ensuring compliance with these applicable laws.
25
12. Respondent Perris Planning Commission (*Planning Commission") is the entity
• 26 which approved the Project, after which the City filed a Notice of Determination ("NOD").
27 While the entity with the ultimate authority for deciding upon land use projects in the City is the
28

1°

• City Council, Petitioner has filed an appeal with that entity, but files the instant Petition to
2 preserve its rights.
3
13. Real Party in Interest IDI Logistics, LLC ("IDI," or "the developer"), is a.
Delaware Limited Liability Company registered with the California Secretary of State. On
information and belief, IDI has offices in El Segundo, California, and its registered agent for the
6 service of process is CT Corporation.
7
14. Real Parties in Interest Does I-XX are sued herein by fictitious name. Their true
8 name and capacity are unknown to Petitioner. When their true name and capacity are
ascertained, Petitioner will amend this Petition by inserting their true name and capacity.
10 Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the fictitiously named Real Parties
11 are responsible in some manner for the occurrences alleged herein.
12
15. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each of the Real
13
Parties gave consent to, ratified, or authorized the acts alleged, and that each of the Real Parties
14 knowingly aided, abetted or conspired with the others to commit the acts alleged herein.
15
IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS AND COMMON ALLEGATIONS
16 A. Standard of Review
17
16. The heart of CEQA is an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"). An EIR is
18 subject to two different standards of review. First, the reviewing court must determine whether
19 the EIR is sufficient as an informational document. The Supreme Court has recently made clear
20 that review for "whether an EIR's discussion of environmental impacts is adequate, that is,
21 whether the discussion sufficiently performs the function of facilitating informed agency
22 decisionmaking and informed public participation," is "de novo" unless the discussion
23 "implicates a factual question." Sierra Club v. County of Fresno (2018) 6 Cal. 5th 502, 513,
24 512, 514. Review of factual questions, such as the type of methodology an agency chooses to
25 assess impacts (as opposed to "whether a description of an environmental impact is insufficient
26 because it lacks analysis or omits the magnitude of an impact") is performed under the less-
27 stringent substantial evidence test. In the main, the claims set forth in this Petition are
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 5

reviewable de novo based on the inadequacy of the discussion in the EIR.
2 B. Inadequate Assessment of Significant Impacts; Inadequate Discussion in the
3 EIR; Conclusions Not Based on Substantial Evidence
4 1. Inadequate Project Description and Segmentation
5
17. The City engaged in "segmentation" or "piecemealing" in violation of CEQA
6 because the City chose to analyze the construction of two buildings - "Rider 2" and "Rider 4" -
7 apart from the overall "Rider Logistics Center" of which they were a part. The "Rider 1" and
8 'Rider 3" buildings were previously approved. CEQA requires analysis of "the whole of an
9 action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment,
10 or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment." CEQA Guidelines
11 § 15378. CEQA Guidelines section 15165 (Multiple and Phased Projects) requires that
12

13 Where individual projects are, or a phased project is, to be undertaken and where the total undertaking comprises a project with significant environmental effect,

14 the lead agency shall prepare a single program EIR for the ultimate project as described in Section 15168.

15 Section 15168 provides for Program EIRs. Section 15165 further indicates that even where a

16 project is not considered to be part of a larger undertaking, the agency "shall . . . comment upon

17 the cumulative effect," which the Rider 2 and 4 EIR failed to do with respect to the Rider 1 and : 1

18 buildings. Petitioner correctly commented that the segmentation of the different Rider buildings

19 into different EIRs circumvented analysis of construction and operation of the Rider Logistics

20 Center as a whole. This is an adequacy of discussion claim subject to de novo review.

21 2. Inadequate Discussion of and Assessment of Impacts to Agricultural

22 Resources

23 18. Draft EIR ("DEIR") section 4.2 addressed Agricultural Resources, asking, as it

24 was required to, in Threshold a., "Would the Project convert Prime Farmland, Unique Farmland,

25 or Farmland of Statewide Importance . to non-agricultural use?" In its comments, Petitioner

26 asserted that the Project would have significant impacts to Farmland of Statewide Importance.

27 The City conceded in its Final EIR ("FEIR") that the Farmland was being converted pursuant to

28 this set of City actions, but it contended that impacts would be less than significant based on the
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 6

1 State Department of Conservation's Land Evaluation and Site Assessment ("LESA") Model. On
2 information and belief, Respondents improperly included the PVSD Channel improvements in
3 the land considered in the Land Evaluation component of the LESA Model, and it is for this
4
reason that the Project did not lead to a significant impact on Agricultural Resources. Because it
5 is impossible to tell from the EIR how the LESA Model was applied, this is an adequacy of
6 discussion claim subject to de novo review.
7
3. Inadequate Assessment and Discussion of Air Quality Impacts; Improper
8
Tiering
9
19. The EIR contained an inadequate discussion of the Project's air quality impacts -
10 and feasible mitigation measures that could respond to them - in at least three respects.
11
20. First, the EIR's backdrop to its analysis of the Project's emissions of NOx- an
12 ozone precursor - so severely understated the region's ozone problem as to make the EIR's
13 discussion meaningless. Specifically, the DEIR selectively asserted that the California Air
14 Resources Board ("CARB") had released an Update to the region's Air Quality Management
15 Plan ("AQMP") which was intended to achieve "the remaining NOx emissions reductions needed
16 to achieve the ozone standard in 2023." What the DEIR failed to disclose was that there. are
17 actually several ozone standards, and the one the DEIR was referring to was the out-of-date 1997
18 8-Hour Ozone Standard of 0.08 parts per million ("ppm"). The present Ozone Standard is 0.070
19
ppm, and the South Coast Air Basin is not projected to achieve compliance with that Standard
20 until 2038, such that the Basin is presently considered to be in "Extreme Nonattainment." None
21 of this was disclosed in the DEIR. Petitioner's comments also pointed out that the Update would
22 not achieve compliance with the outdated 0.08 Standard by the beginning of 2023 in any event.
23
21. The FEIR attempted to dismiss Petitioner's comments by asserting that the
24 Project's Air Quality Impact Analysis properly reflected "improvements to regional air quality"
25 over time. As Petitioner pointed out, the referenced chart only showed a slight reduction in
26 exceedances of the 0.08 ppm Standard Basin-wide, and the maximum federal 8-hour
27 concentration has increased in the Project area (Source Receptor Area 24) since 2016, as have
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 7

*,3

-

2 the number of days the federal 8-hour Standard has been exceeded, and the number of days the

3 State 1-Hour Standard has been exceeded. While this could be discerned from a Table in the

4 DEIR, it should have been in the text to provide the true context for the Project's NOx emissions.

22.
5 Second, the DEIR did not contain a full quantitative analysis of the risks of cancer

6 for neighbors of the Project, because the applicant failed to conduct a quantitative health risk

7 assessment ("HRA") for construction emissions as well as operational emissions. When

8 Petitioner and its consultant commented on the subject in response to the DEIR, the City came

9 forward with an HRA for construction emissions, but it failed to add the risks from construction

10 to those from operation as the State Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment

11 ("OEHHA") mandates. If the City had done so, it would have arrived at a health risk that

12 exceeded a risk of ten in a million, which is the South Coast Air Quality Management District's

13 ("SCAQMD's") threshold for significance for cancer risk. Further, as Petitioner pointed out, the

14 cumulative impacts from the Rider 1 and Rider 3 buildings should have been considered in a

15 Program EIR.

23.
16 Third, in its EIR, the City refused to properly consider the feasibility of requiring

17 mitigation which could have significantly reduced the Project's emissions of NOx. Specifically,

18 the City could have implemented a requirement for Tier 4 Final construction equipment, as well

as
19 requirements for solar panels and electric car and truck charging, both of which could have

20 significantly reduced NOx. The City was required. to consider all feasible mitigation, see City of

21 Marina v. Bd. of Trustees of Cal. State Univ. (2006) 39 Cal. 4th 341, 349, and its conclusion that

22 it could not control tailpipe emissions was both not based on substantial evidence and

23 represented a failure to proceed by law by including adequate discussion in the EIR.

24 4. Biological Resources

24.
25 There is substantial evidence of a fair argument that the Project may have a

26 significant impact on biological resources in at least three respects.

25.
27 First, the City's EIR failed to acknowledge a potential significant impact upon the

28 federally listed Stephens kangaroo rat ("SKR"). The DEIR asserted that no protocol surveys for

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 8

1 the SKR were required because core reserves were deemed complete in 2003, but Section 7 of
2 the County of Riverside's SKR Ordinance No. 663 as amended provides that a mitigation fee is
3 only appropriate if it is determined through the environmental review process that onsite
4 mitigation is not warranted, and it was not so determined in this case, because no surveys of any
sort for the SKR were done.
6
26. Second and Third, the City did not comply with the California Department of Fish
7 & Wildlife's 2012 Staff Report on Burrowing Owl Mitigation, which is specifically made
applicable by the Western Riverside County Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan
("MSHCP") Guidelines relating to the Western burrowing owl, in two respects, and it failed to
10 acknowledge a potentially significant impact to the owl for those two reasons. Specifically, a
11 burrowing owl was found within 88 feet of the Project site, and was not surveyed for the year
12 before the EIR was issued. The EIR failed to incorporate adequate mitigations to assure that
13 there would be no significant impact to the owl because (1) the EIR and its Mitigation and
14 Monitoring Plan required preconstruction surveys 30 days in advance of construction rather than
15 no more than 14 days in advance as required by the. CDFW Staff Report, and (2) the EIR and its
16 a Mitigation and Monitoring Plan only required a 300-foot buffer around any active nests during
17 the breeding season, but the Staff Report requires a distance of 500 meters.
18 5. Greenhouse Gas Impacts
19
27. Under CEQA, lead agencies are now required to analyze GHG impacts against 20 two thresholds: first, whether the Project will lead to significant GHGs directly or indirectly, and 21
second, whether the Project would "conflict with an applicable plan, policy or regulation adopted 22
for the purpose of reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases." The DEIR acknowledged that 23
the Project would have a significant impact under the first threshold, but not the second. This
24
represented a failure to proceed by law and represented inadequacy of discussion under CEQA,
25

26 reviewable under the de novo standard. In particular, the City claimed that the Project was
consistent with the City's Climate Action Plan ("CAP") when it was not, and when that CAP did
27
not provide an adequate measuring stick because it only legitimately projected GHG reductions 28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 9

2 through 2020. And the City's assertion that the Project would be consistent with CARB's 2017
support the State's
3 Scoping Plan Update was false, because the Project has no measures to
Sustainable Freight Action Plan, because the Project will emit black carbon when the State's
4 goal is to reduce emissions of the same, and because the Update calls for protecting agricultural
land, when the Project does the opposite.
6 6. Energy Impacts
7
28.
8 Appendix F to F the CEQA Guidelines, relating to energy, provides that projects
should demonstrate the "wise and efficient" use of energy in construction and operation. The 9
DEIR failed to assess compliance with this standard.
10
29. As Petitioner also pointed out, a lead agency does not demonstrate compliance
11 with Appendix F merely by showing compliance with Title 24 • yet this is all the City set out to
12
do in its DEIR.
13
30. The DEIR was further inadequate in that it failed to discuss compliance with
14 plans for installation of renewable energy (which even the out-of-date Perris CAP calls for), or
15

16 for conservation of energy, as required under Appendix F and the Guidelines.
C. Inadequate Mitigation
17
31. CEQA requires lead agencies to adopt all feasible mitigations with respect to any
18 significant impacts, before a lead agency can adopt a statement of overriding considerations.
19

20 Here, the City failed to adopt a number of feasible mitigations which Petitioner and others
identified which could have reduced the severity of the Project's impacts. Those mitigations
21 were required because impacts were significant.
22
32. Those mitigation measures included reducing Air Quality, Energy, and GHG
23

24 impacts by requiring the installation of solar panels and electric vehicle including electric truck

25 charging, and taking the steps for the protection of the burrowing owl mandated by the 2012
CDFW Staff Report.

Re: IDI Rider 2 &4 High Cube Warehouses and PVSD Channel Improvement Project EIR
(SCH No. 2019100297)

Dear City of Perris and Honorable City of Perris Planning Commission Members:

This is to advise you that Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance (*GSEJA") plans to file a
Petition for Writ of Mandate with respect to the above-captioned Project pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act. Specifically, GSEJA will challenge the City's and Planning Commission's actions as follows:

a. Certification of the EIR with the determination that the EIR has been prepared in compliance with the requirements of CEQA (Case No. 19-05180).
b. Development Plan Review (DPR) (Case No. 19-00004) for the Rider 2 and Rider 4 site plans and building elevations.

C. Tentative Parcel Map (TPM) No. 37437 for the Rider 2 site (Case No. 19- 05058) to merge five existing parcels into one parcel and one lettered lot for dedication to the RCFC&WCD; and, vacate all or portions of the rights-of- way of three unimproved streets (Redlands Avenue, Kitching Street, and Adams Street).
