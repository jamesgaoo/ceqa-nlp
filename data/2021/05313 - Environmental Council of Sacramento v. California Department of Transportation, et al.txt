N M7 uvo By this action, Petitioner ENVIRONMENTAL COUNCIL OF SACRAMENTO
challenges Respondent CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION'S approval of
the Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") for American River Bridge Deck Replacement
Project (*Project"), the required findings under the California Environmental Quality Act
("CEQA"), Public Resources Code, section 21000 et seq., and the approval of the Project. The

7 MND asserts that the purpose of the Project is to rehabilitate the American River Bridge along

8 State Route ("SR") 51 in Sacramento County from post mile 2.0 to 3.5.

2. The IS/MND does not provide adequate environmental review under CEQA. The

10 MND fails to provide an adequate project description and piecemeals environmental review of

11 other planned improvements and widening of SR 51. Additionally, substantial evidence supports

12 a fair argument that the Project may have potentially significant impacts to greenhouse gas
emissions ("GHG"*) and climate change.

13 3.

14 Petitioner seeks a determination from this Court that Respondents' approval of the

15 Project is invalid and void and that Initial Study/Mitigated Negative ("IS/MND") Declaration for

16 the Project fails to satisfy the requirements of CEQA, and the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14,
California Code of Regulations, section 15000 et seq.

17 PARTIES

18 4.

:19 Petitioner Environmental Council of Sacramento ("ECOS") is a California -

20 nonprofit public benefit corporation working to protect and improve the environmental quality of

21 the Greater Sacramento Metropolitan Region and its adjoining ecosystems. Its members include |

22 other environmental organizations, neighborhood groups, and individuals. ECOS has expressed

23 particular concern for the environment in which its members live, including Sacramento County. |

5.

24 The environment and residents of Sacramento County will be directly affected by

25 the impacts of the Project. ECOS members live, work, travel, and enjoy recreational activities

26 in Sacramento County. These members have a particular interest in the protection of the

27 environment of Sacramento County, and are increasingly concerned about worsening ofi

28 environmental and land use conditions that detrimentally affect their well-being and that of
other residents and visitors to Sacramento County. ECOS and its members have a direct and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondents comply with laws relating to

N m tnn g environmental protection. ECOS and its members are adversely affected by Respondents' -.

failure to comply with CEQA in approving the Project.

6. Respondent California Department of Transportation ("CalTrans") is an agency of
the State of California. CalTrans is the CEQA "lead agency" for the Project. As lead agency
for the Project, CalTrans is responsible for preparation of an environmental document and
0 describes the Project and its impacts, and if necessary evaluates mitigation measures and/or A

8 alternatives to lessen or avoid any significant environmental impacts. CalTrans is responsible

9 for implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines with -

10 respect to the Project.

11 7. Respondent Toks Omishakin, is the Director of CalTrans. As Director, Mr.

12 Omishakin is responsible for the day-to-day operation of CalTrans. Mr. Omishakin is sued in

13 his official capacity as Director of CalTrans.

14 8. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents identified as

15 Does 1-20. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Respondents Does|

16 1-20, inclusive, are individuals, entities or agencies with material interests affected by the

17 Project with respect to the Project or by the County's actions with respect to the Project. When
18 the true identities and capacities of these Respondents have been determined, Petitioner will,

19 with leave of Court if necessary, amend this Petition to insert such identities and capacities.

20 BACKGROUND EACTS

21 THE PROJECT

22 9. The Project is located on State Route 51 in Sacramento County from mile post

23 (*PM") 2.0 to 35. The American River Bridge, a multi-span bridge, was originally built in

24 1954 with two lanes in each direction. In 1966, an additional lane was added in each direction

25 in the median. In 1977 and again in 1988, the American River Bridge was seismically

26 retrofitted in various locations.

27 10. A thin asphalt concrete overlay that has worn off covers the American River

28 Bridge Deck. Caltrans' Bridge Needs Report for the American River Bridge identified bridge
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 3

deck has cracks/spalls and needs major deck rehabilitation to help preserve the deck and

2 provide a better wearing surface.
m 11. The Project is programmed in the Sacramento Area Council of Governments

v ("SACOG") Metropolitan Transportation Implementation Plan (MTIP, 2019-2020).

12. Another proposed project (Caltrans EA 03-0H931, SR 51 Corridor Improvements)
vo provides for the widening of SR 51 and American River Bridge to accommodate three mixed

7 flow lanes, one bus/carpool lane, and one auxiliary lane in each direction. This would occur

8 from E Street to El Camino A venue in the City of Sacramento (PM 1.0 to 4.4), The SR 51

9 Corridor Improvements Project is currently not fully funded and the IS/MND did not discuss or

10 analyze that project. On September 18, 2017 Caltrans released a Notice of Preparation of a

11 Draft Environmental Impact Report for the SR 51 Corridor Improvements Project.

12 13. The Initial Study identified three build alternatives. The Project Description for

:13 Alternative 1 includes the following:

14 a. Remove and replace the existing concrete bridge deck with a 1¼"* thicker

15 deck than existing deck.

16 b. Widen the American River Bridge to maintain 3 lanes 3 of traffic in each

17 direction during construction.

18 C. Provide a 14 foot bike/pedestrian path on the northbound side of the bridge

19 separated from the traffic by a concrete barrier. The bike/pedestrian path will extend from

20 levee to levee. Portions of the path outside of the bridge limits are anticipated to be funded

21 with 2020 SHOPP Complete Streets Reservation funds.

22 d. Widen the substructure and superstructure by 54°-11"t on the northbound

23 side of the structure.

24 e, Widen the approaches of SR 51 to accommodate the widening of the

25 American River Bridge.

26 f. Modification of an existing soundwall on the southeast side of the

27 American River bridge.

28 g. Construct 30 foot approach slabs.

4 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

WN- h. Strengthen existing girders.
Lengthen a box culvert to the East, North of the American River Bridge.

+ Install overhead sign.

k. Widen bridge abutments, footings, bents, and piers supported by piles.
1. Install permanent sheet piles at piers 4-6 for scour mitigation.

m. Construct temporary construction access trestles and cofferdams to
~ ca facilitate construction on in-water piers.

O. Install lighting on the proposed bike/pedestrian path.

9 p. Create a temporary construction access road across a wetland area or/and
839 2 use existing dirt road to access the construction site.

q• Construct median barrier (Type 60) and bridge barrier (Type 842).
L Upgrade existing metal beam guardrail to Midwest Guardrail System.

S. Replace steel girder post-tensioning system at spans 1 & 2.
14 L. Construct concrete catcher blocks underneath existing girders.
15 u, Install new joint seals.

16 V. Near abutment 1, construct a retaining wall and soundwall from the
17 modified soundwall along the Northbound side of the bighway, near the Southeast quadrant of

18 the American River Bridge and extend the retaining wall down the bike/pedestrian path.

19 w. Construct retaining walls between American River Bridge and Cal Expo

20 undercrossing.

21 X. Remove vegetation and trees to accommodate widening of SR 51 for

22 bridge deck construction staging.

23 y. Modify Exposition Boulevard northbound off-Ramp.
24 Z. Widen Cal Expo undercrossing on the northbound side.

25 aa. Modify the Exposition Boulevard off-ramp in the northbound direction

26 14. The Project Description for Alternative 2 includes the project scope for Alternative,

27 but varies in the following elements:
28 a. Widen the substructure to the ultimate width by 38' -11"+ on the

5 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-0M tON• southbound side to accommodate the future widening of SR 51.

b. Alternative 2 is contingent on obtaining additional construction capital
funding (Non-SHOPP) prior to RTL.

15, The Project Description for Alternative 3 includes the project scope for Alternative,
but varies in the following elements:

a. Widen superstructure and substructure by 38'-11"t on the southbound side
to accommodate the future widening of SR 51.

b. Requires no girder strengthening.

9 C. Alternative 3 is contingent on obtaining additional construction capital
10 funding (Non-SHOPP) prior to RTL.
= d. Re-align the portion of the American River bicycle trail, which runs below
12 and parallel to the bridge to be further from the edge of deck.
13 16. The Project provides for the new substructure of the bridge to be built to
14 accommodate Caltrans' widening for with the SR 51 Corridor Improvements Project
866550 17. The Initial Study failed to identify a preferred alternative.

B. CALTRANS' APPROVAL OF THE PROJECT

18. In October 2020, CalTrans released for public review and comment the Initial
Study with Proposed Negative Declaration.

19, On February 17, 2021, CalTrans approved the Project and found the Project will
-t- not have a significant effect on the environment.

21 20. On March 1,2021, CalTrans posted with the State of California, Office of

22 Planning and Research (State Clearing House) a Notice of Determination under Public

23 Resources Code, section 21152. The Notice of Determination fails to identify which Project

24 alternative CalTrans approved.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE 25

26 21. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to

27 Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, and Public Resources Code section 21168.5. In the

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 10945 and
Public Resources Code section 21168.

22. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394(a), venue is proper in this Court +10N.0 n because the Project is located in the County of Sacramento.
EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY

23. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant action
and has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

24. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code, section
21167.5 by sending via facsimile and Federal Express written notice of this action to the 10 Respondents. A copy of this written notice and proof of service are attached as Exhibit A to this L
Petition for Writ of Mandate.
12
25. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by 13 concurrently filing a request concerning preparation of the record of administrative proceedings 14
relating to this action. 15
26. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law 16 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require respondents to set aside their 17

18 approval of the Project and certification of the EIR. In the absence of such remedies, CalTrans'

19 approval will remain in effect in violation of State law.

27. This action has been brought within 30 days of CalTrans filing of the Notice of 20 Determination as required by Public Resources Code section 21167(c). - 21 STANDING
22
28. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because Petitioner

29. Petitioner realleges and incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 28, 28 inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- N0 tnOr- 30. Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in
manner required by law by relying on an IS/MND that fails to meet CEQA's requirements
for disclosure, analysis, and/or mitigation of significant project impacts.

31. Respondents' action in adopting the IS/MND violates CEQA in that Respondents
failed to proceed in the manner required by law and their decision not to prepare an
environmental impact report ("EIR") and to segment environmental review of the whole SR51
widening project is not supported by substantial evidence.

32. Approval of the Project, based on a MND instead of an EIR violates CEQA as
9 substantial evidence supports a fair argument that the Project may have potentially significant

10 impacts. CEQA requires full disclosure of a project's significant environmental effects so that

11 decision makers and the public are informed of consequences before a project is approved, to

12 ensure that government officials are held accountable for these consequences. (Laurel Heights

13 Improvement Ass'n of San Francisco v. Regents of the University of California ("Laurel Heights]

14 I") (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.)

15 33. An agency must prepare an EIR instead of a MND whenever a proposed project

16 may have a significant impact on the environment. (Pub. Resources Code. § 21082.2(d) [*If
17 is there is substantial evidence, in light of the whole record before the lead agency, that a project

18 may have a significant effect on the environment, an environmental impact report shall be

19 prepared."]) An agency's decision not to prepare an EIR is judged by the "fair argument"

20 standard of review. Under this standard, an EIR must be prepared "whenever it can be fairly

21 argued on the basis of substantial evidence that the project may have significant environmental|

22 impact." (No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68,75, emphasis added; Laurel

23 Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1123.) |

24 The fair argument standard is a "low threshold" test for requiring the preparation of an EIR.

25 (No Oil, supra, 13 Cal.3d at 84.)

26 A. THE MND CONTAINS A LEGALLY INADEQUATE PROJECT DESCRIPTION

27 34. An initial study must accurately describe the proposed project. (Guidelines
non of an 28 §15071(a).) "An accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 8

informative and legally sufficient [CEQA document)." (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles
(1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 193.) CEQA requires a complete project description to ensure that
0 + 1 0 all of the project's environmental impacts are considered. (City of Santee v. County of San
Diego (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1450, 1454; see also Communities for a Better Environment v.
City of Richmond (2010) 184 Cal App.4th 70, 82.) A curtailed, enigmatic or unstable project
a description draws a red herring across the path of public input." (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue
Center v. County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 656; quoting County of Inyo, supra,
,c0 71 Cal.App.3d at 197-198.)

9 35. The Project Description describes three Project Alternatives, but fails to identify

10 which alternative is the actual Project and which alternative is specifically addressed in the

11 Initial Study. Thus, the Project Description is vague and ambiguous as to what has been

12 evaluated and what has been approved.

13 36. The Project Description also fails to address the whole of the action which is the

14 expansion and widening of SR 51, along with the widening the American River Bridge. CEQA

15 defines a "project" as "an acti vity that may cause either a direct physical change in the

16 environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment, which

17 constitutes an activity directly undertaken by any public agency." (Pub. Resources Code, §

18 21065.) The CEQA Guidelines further define a "project" as "the whole of an action, which has

'19 potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably

20 foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment" and that is an activity directly

21 undertaken by any public agency acti vity which is being approved. (CEQA Guidelines, § -

22 15378(a)(1).) "The term project refers to the activity which is being approved and which may

23 be subject to several discretionary approvals by governmental agencies. The term 'project'

24 does not mean each separate governmental approval." (ld., § 15378(c).) The term "approval"

25 refers to a public agency decision that commits the agency to a definite course of action in

26 regard to a project. (Id., § 15352(a).) The definition of "approval" applies to all projects

27 including actions authorized or carried out by a public agency. (ld.) Thus, an initial study must

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F

2 consider all phases of project planning, implementation, and operation, including phases

c planned for future implementation. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15063(a)(l).)

37. The IS/MND states that the new structure will be built to accommodate the
proposed widening of future Caltrans' Project. The SR 51 Corridor Improvements Project,
which includes the widening of the American River Bridge is currently under environmental
review by Caltrans. The NOP for the SR51 Corridor Improvement Project states that Project

8 consists of replacing the bridge deck of the American River Bridge and widen the bridge to

9 accommodate 3 mixed flows in each direction, one bus/carpool lane in each direction, and one

10 auxiliary lane in each direction, for a total of 10 lanes. Thus, the widening of SR 51, including

I1 the expansion of lanes is the whole of the Project. That expansion includes the widening of the

12 American River Bridge that is the subject of the MND.

38.

13 The IS/MND's failure to describe the whole of the project violates CEQA'S

14 requirements and constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and is contrary to law.

B.

15 39. THE MND SEGMENTS ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW OF THE WHOLE PROJECT

16 CEQA forbids "piecemeal" review of the significant environmental impacts of a

17 project. (Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay Com. v. Board of Port Commissioners (2001) 91 -

18 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1358; and Laurel Heights I, supra, 47 Cal.3d at 396 ['"Laurel Heights "'];

19 and Guidelines § 15165.) When a specific project contemplates future expansion, the lead

20 agency is required to review all phases of the project. (Laurel Heights I, supra, 47 Cal.3d at -

21 376; see also Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th

22 1209, 1224.) This requirement reflects CEQA's broad definition of "project" as "the whole of -t

23 an action" that may impact the environment. (Guidelines § 15378; and see Habitat &

24 Watershed Caretakers v. City of Santa Cruz (2013) 213 Cal App 4th 1277, 1297.) What

25 constitutes the "whole of an action" is & question of law that courts independently decide.

26 (Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v City of Sonora (2007) 155

27 Cal .App.4th 1214, 1224.) "[T]he requirements of CEQA cannot be avoided by chopping up

28 proposed projects into bite-sized pieces which, when taken individually, may have
significant adverse effect on the environment." (ld. at 1222-1223.) nO

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 10

- Nm t0 0000 40. The Supreme Court explained that an agency must anal yze the effects of potential -
future development if such development is: (1) "a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the
initial project;" and (2) "will likely change the scope of nature of the initial project or its
environmental effects." (Laurel Heights I, supra, 47 Cal .3d at 396.)

41. The Project meets the first part of the test as the widening and expansion of SR51
is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the American River Bridge deck replacement, since
it is more than just a deck replacement but a widening and expansion of bridge capacity that
will facilitate the construction of the SR51 Corridor Improvement Project (Caltrans EA 03-

9 0H931). The foreseeability is not speculation as in September 2017 Caltrans released an NOP -
10 for the SR51 Corridor Improvement Project and is preparing a draft environmental impact
5 9 report for that project, which specifically includes the Project that is the subject of the IS/MND.

42, The Project meets the second part of the test of whether the future development
13 "will likely change the scope or nature of the initial project or its environmental effects." As

14 the future development includes the significant expansion of SR 51, including the American

15 River Bridge, it includes the expansion to three mixed flow lanes, one bus/carpool lane, and one

16 auxiliary lane in each direction for a total of 10 lanes. Such expansion of SR51 will most

17 certainly change the scope and nature of American River Bridge Project and its environmental

18 effects, especially as set forth in the IS/MND.

:19 43. Caltrans' decision to limit environmental review to only the deck replacement for

20 the American River Bridge violates CEQA's prohibition on segmentation of en vironmental

21 review. As such, Caltrans' approval of the IS/MND and approval of the Project constitutes a

22 prejudicial abuse of discretion and is contrary to law.

23 C. THE MND FAILS TO ADDRESS CUMULATIVE IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH

24 THE CAPITOL CITY FREEWAY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT

25 44. The IS/MND fails to comply with the requirements of CEQA in that it fails to

26 adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the Project's cumulative environmental impacts as

27 required by law. CEQA requires an EIR to discuss a project's significant cumulative effect on
28 the environment in conjunction with other closely related past, present and reasonably

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- foreseeable probable future projects. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21083(b); CEQA Guidelines, §§
N 15130(b)(1)(A), 15355.) The term "'[c]umulati ve impacts' refer[s] to two or more indi vidual
m effects which, when considered together, are considerable or which compound or increase other

1 o environmental impacts." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15355.) An EIR must discuss if the
"cumulati ve impact may be significant and the project's incremental effect, though individually
limited, is cumulatively considerable." (Id., § 15064(h)(1).) "'Cumulatively considerable'
means that the incremental effects of past projects, the effects of other current projects, and the

8 effects of probable future projects." (Id.)

9 45. A legally adequate "cumulative impacts analysis" views a particular project over

10 time and in conjunction with other related past, present, and reasonably foresecable probable

11 future projects whose impacts might compound or interrelate with those of the project at hand.

12 "Cumulative impacts can result from individually minor but collectively significant projects
13 taking place over a period of time." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15355(b); see Communities for a

14 Better Environment supra, 103 Cal.App.4th at 117, ["The cumulative impact from several
15 projects is the change in the environment which results from the incremental impact of the

16 project when added to other closely related past, present, and reasonably foreseeable probable

17 future projects.."].)

18 46. The NOP for the SR51 Corridor Improvement Project identifies a reasonably
19 foreseeable probable future project that is not only related to this Project, but includes this

20 Project. The NOP identifies numerous temporary and permanent environmental effects such

21 aesthetics, air quality, biological resources, cultural resources, land use planning, recreation;

22 and transportation/traffic.

23 47. Caltrans' failure to includes a cumulati ve impacts analysis that includes the SR51
24 Corridor Improvement Project violates CEQA. As such approval of the Project constitutes a
25 prejudicial abuse of discretion and is contrary to law.

N 0tnON . SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE SUPPORTS A FAIR ARGUMENT THE PROJECT MAY
HAVE SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT.

48. Substantial evidence in the administrative record supports a "fair argument" that
the Project may result in a significant impact to the environment. The substantial evidence
before Respondents demonstrate that:

1. GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM CONSTRUCTION

49, The IS/MND discussion of construction impacts to climate change fails to address

9 emissions associated with the use of substantial quantities of concrete. Concrete production

10 contributes 8 percent of global GHG. While the IS/MND clearly states the construction

11 includes the use of concrete, the Initial Study makes no effort to quantify or analyze the amount

12 of GHG emissions associated with the use of concrete. The IS/MND references GHG

13 emissions from material processing, but does not state if that if includes GHG emissions from the

14 concrete. Table 3 provides estimates of GHG Emissions during construction, but provides no

15 breakdown of the source of the emissions. (IS, Table 3 at 86.) Thus, it is unclear what
constitutes the source of the GHG emissions.

16 50.

17 The IS/MND concludes that "With implementation of construction GHG-reduction |

18 measures, the impact would be less than significant." The IS/MND also does not identify any

:19 threshold of si gnificance for GHG emissions, yet it makes a conclusion that the Projection's -

20 construction impacts are less than significant. It is unclear how that conclusion can be reached

21 without any quantification of the supposed reduction of GHG during construction and without

22 any standards to apply. (CEQA Guidelines, 15064(b)(1); Cleveland National Forest

23 Foundation v. San Diego Association of Governments (2017) 3 Cal.5th 497, 515 [lead agency's

24 choice of thresholds of significance must be "based to the extent possible on scientific and

factual data."].)

25 51.

26 Caltrans makes significance determination without any standard of significance

27 and without any substantial evidence that the impact would be less than significant. The

28 IS/MND simply cannot make this statement without having quantified the reduction in GHG
emissions and then applying that to a standard that Caltrans has failed to identify.

1 52. The IS/MND also provides for the implementation of measures to reduce GHG
N.0 t10N co emissions from construction activities, such as compliance with emission reduction regulations
mandated by the California Air Resources Board. The IS/MND, however, makes no effort to
identify or disclose what activities are required so as to reduce the emissions nor does it
quantify the reductions in emissions from those acti vities.

53. The IS/MND specifically states that it is the implementation of the reduction
measures that makes the impact less than significant, but fails to include them or require them
as mitigation measures. (See Pub. Resources Code, § 21080(c); CEQA Guidelines, §§

9 15070(b)(1); 15071(e).)
OÑES 54. The record supports a fair argument that the Project may have significant impacts
to greenhouse gas emissions.

2. Vehicle Miles Travelled

55. The IS/MND fails to include any discussion regarding VMT and simply concludes
that the project will not result in any increase in operational GHG emissions. is This is based upon
15 the false assumption the Project will not increase traffic capacity. The IS/MND also ignores that|

16 it is reasonably foreseeable that the Project will result in widening the American River Bridge

17 and adjacent portions of SR 51.
18 56. The record supports : fair argument that the Project will lead to an increase in

19 highway which leads to increased VMT that the IS/MND has not evaluated.

20 3. Biological Resources

21 57. The IS/MND fails to evaluate the Project's impacts to bats and the Western Pond

22 Turtle. Substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument that the Project, as well as

23 the widening Project, will result in significant impact bats that use the bridge for habitat, as well

24 as impacts to the Western Pond Turtle.
25 58. The IS/MND fails to adequately mitigate the permanent loss of 0.33 acres of habitat|
26 for federally listed salmonids and the permanent removal of 3.83, acres of riparian vegetation as
27 it directly relates to Chinook Salmon. As such, substantial evidence in the record supports a fair

argument that the Project will result in significant impacts to biological resources, including

salmon.
