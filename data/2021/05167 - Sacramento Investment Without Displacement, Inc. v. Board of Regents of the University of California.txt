INSTRUCTIOS ON HOW TO COMPLETE THE COVER .EET CM-010
To Plaintiffs and Others Filing First Papers. If you are filing a first paper (for example, a complaint) in a civil case, you must complete and file, along with your first paper, the Civil Case Cover Sheet contained on page 1. This information will be used to compile statistics about the types and numbers of cases filed. You must complete items 1 through 6 on the sheet. In item 1, you must check one box for the case type that best describes the case. If the case fits both a general and a more specific type of case listed in item 1, check the more specific one. If the case has multiple causes of action, check the box that best indicates the primary cause of action. To assist you in completing the sheet, examples of the cases that belong under each case type in item 1 are provided below. A cover sheet must be filed only with your initial paper. Failure to file a cover sheet with the first paper filed in a civil case may subject a party, its counsel, or both to sanctions under rules 2.30 and 3.220 of the California Rules of Court. To Parties in Rule 3.740 Collections Cases. A "collections case" is under rule 3.740 is defined as an action for recovery of money owed in a sum stated to be certain that is not more than $25,000, exclusive of interest and attorney's fees, arising from a transaction in which property, services, or money was acquired on credit. A collections case does not include an action seeking the following: (1) tort damages, (2) punitive damages, (3) recovery of real property, (4) recovery of personal property, or (5) a prejudgment writ of attachment. The identification of a case as a rule 3.740 collections case on this form means that it will be exempt from the general time-for-service requirements and case management rules, unless a defendant files responsive pleading. A rule 3.740 collections case will be subject to the requirements for service and obtaining a judgment in rule 3.740. To Parties in Complex Cases. In complex cases only, parties must also use the Civil Case Cover Sheet to designate whether the case is complex. If a plaintiff believes the case is complex under rule 3.400 of the California Rules of Court, this must be indicated by completing the appropriate boxes in items 1 and 2. If a plaintiff designates a case as complex, the cover sheet must be served with the complaint on all parties to the action. A defendant may file and serve no later than the time of its first appearance a joinder in the plaintiffs designation, a counter-designation that the case is not complex, or, if the plaintiff has made no designation, designation that the case is complex.

3 Petitioner SACRAMENTO INVESTMENT WITHOUT DISPLACEMENT, INC.

4 ("SIWD" or "Petitioner") petitions this Court for a writ of mandate directed to Respondent

5 BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ("UC" or "Respondent"),
alleging as follows:

6 1.

7 On November 19, 2020, the UC approved its UC Davis Sacramento Campus 2020

8 Long Range Development Plan Update (*2020 LRDP") and Aggie Square Phase 1 (collectively

9 the "Project"). The UC also certified its UC Davis Sacramento Campus Long Range

10 Development Plan Update and Final Supplemental Environmental Impact Report ("SEIR") as its

11 environmental review document for the Project pursuant to the California Environmental
Quality Act ("CEQA").
12 2.

13 The Project would increase the current UC Davis Sacramento Campus population

14 to 21,200 from an existing population of 13,500. This represents a population increase of 7,700

15 while providing only 324 housing units for 411 on-campus residents. Thus, the vast majority of

16 the Project's population will need to find housing in the neighborhoods surrounding the Project
or elsewhere.

17 3.

18 According to the City of Sacramento ("City") Market Study of Planning Areas and

19 Community Plan area, the Broadway/Fruitridge community plan area's population is over 87

20 percent non-white and have a median income of only $44,501 compared to the County median

21 income of $86,300. The types of potential impacts resulting from the Project will create a

22 foreseeable disproportionate impact on protected classes in the surrounding neighborhoods.
4.

23 While the Project could be an opportunity to benefit UC Davis, the City, and

24 immediately surrounding neighborhoods alike, appropriate measures must be taken to ensure

25 that existing residents of these surrounding communities equitably benefit from the planned

26 improvements. Unless the deficiencies in the UC's EIR are corrected, the UC's actions will

27 exacerbate existing housing inequities and drive displacement in some of Sacramento's most
historically underserved communities.
28
SOLURI

A LAW 2

CORPORATION VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 5. The Sacramento Housing Alliance ("SHA") describes the Project's significant

2 potential to displace nearby low-income residents, explaining in relevant part:

3 Much of the area around the UC Davis Sacramento Campus has been identified by
4 UC Berkeley's Urban Displacement Project as either already experiencing ongoing gentrification or at risk of doing so. According to [U.S. Census Bureau

5 estimate data], the neighborhoods surrounding the Sacramento Campus experienced significant demographic change between 2008 and 2017: overall

6 median household income increased almost 12% the percentage of the population that is white and non-Hispanic/Latinx has increased . even as the

7 percentage of the population that is white and non-Hispanic/Latinx in the city as a whole decreased. ... rents have increased, and the rental vacancy rate decreased .

8 making it even more difficult for lower income households to find affordable homes in the area. Without significant mitigation, the Aggie Square project stands to accelerate these trends . . .

10 6. The UC does not, however, mitigate the Project's impact on displacement.
11 Instead, the UC adopts a strained legal position that somehow displacement is outside the scope

12 of issues that must be disclosed and mitigated under CEQA. Rather than take leadership by
13 mitigating the impacts of its own Project, the UC instead seeks to slough off that duty to other
14 entities such as the City.

15 7. The UC takes this same approach with respect to other issues. For example,
16 Caltrans requested that UC study the Project's safety impacts at a U.S. 50 interchange, and the
17 UC responded by asserting this was somehow Caltrans' responsibility. Also, The City requested
18 that the UC provide additional information to ensure safe linkages between City and UC
19 transportation facilities, and further ensure necessary mitigation was adequately funded, but the
20 UC refuses. Finally, the UC refuses to reduce, or even mitigate, its GHG emissions to the levels
21 set forth in statewide policy, and instead purports to comply with an arbitrary "net zero"
22 standard.

23 8. While the Project is laudable, the SEIR fails to adequately analyze potentially
24 significant environmental effects in several resource areas, fails to properly set forth and
25 evaluate all feasible mitigation measures and Project alternatives, and fails to support its
26 findings with substantial evidence. As such, the SEIR is fundamentally inadequate in its
27 preparation and must be set aside. The UC can and must do better to disclose and mitigate the
28 Project's impacts.

3 ("SIWD" or "Petitioner") is a California domestic nonprofit organization. SIWD is a coalition of

4 social justice advocates, equity-focused organizations, and community partners organized to

5 support the health and stability of neighborhoods impacted by development and to create a

6 united voice for local environmental concerns.

7 10. Respondent THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ("UC"

8 a or "Respondent") is a public trust corporation and state agency established pursuant to the

9 California Constitution vested with administering the University of California. The UC acted as
10 the CEQA "lead agency" for the Project, its impacts, mitigation measures, and alternatives to

11 lessen or avoid any significant environmental impacts.

13 governmental, co-conspirator, partner or alter-ego of those Respondents sued herein under the

14 fictitious names 1 of DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, are not known to Petitioner, who therefore

15 sues those Respondents by such fictitious names. Petitioner will ask leave of Court to amend

16 this Petition and insert the true names and capacities of these Respondents when the same have
17 been ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believes and, on that basis, alleges, that
18 Respondents designated herein as DOE Respondents are legally responsible in some manner for
19 the events and happenings alleged in this Petition, and that Petitioner's alleged injuries were
20 proximately caused by said Respondents' conduct.

21 FACTUAL BACKGROUND
22 The Proposed Project and UC Approval Process

23 12. The UC Davis Sacramento campus is located approximately 2.5 miles southeast of
24 the State Capitol and 17 miles east of the UC Davis main campus in Davis, California. The UC
25 Davis Sacramento campus consists of approximately 150 acres and houses UC Davis Health.
26 13. The relevant underlying UC actions at issue include approval of the 2020 LRDP

27 and Aggie Square Phase I. UC long range development plans are like a city or county's general a
28

CORPORATION VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 plans in that they establish the land use patterns and relevant policies that guide campus

2 development. The SEIR purports to provide programmatic review of the 2020 LRDP.

3 14. The Project would increase the current UC Davis Sacramento Campus population

4 to 21,200 from an existing population of 13,500 with only 324 housing units proposed for an

5 estimated 411 on campus residents. To accommodate the increased population and respond to

6 evolving higher education needs at UC Davis, the 2020 LRDP purports to provide additional

7 capacity for facility growth above the 2010 LRDP forecast of 6.57 million gsf to a new 2020

8 LRDP forecast of 7.07 million gsf.

9 15. The UC also certified the SEIR as a project-level CEQA document for Aggie

10 Square Phase I, which includes four new buildings, totaling more than 1.3 million square feet,

11 along with improvements to the roughly 9.55-acre site. The four buildings comprise

12 approximately 1,233,290 gross square feet (gsf) of building space and an additional 549,996 gsf
13 of parking structure space. One of the buildings would be a 329,530 gsf office, classroom, and a

14 co-working space in a ten-story building called the Lifelong Learning Tower. An additional
15 620,260 gsf would be used for science, technology, and engineering in two buildings that would
16 be up to eight stories tall. The fourth building included in the Aggie Square Project is a 283,500
17 gsf apartment building that would contain 324 multi-family apartment units, and expected to

18 house 411 people.

19 16. A Notice of Preparation ("NOP") for the SEIR was prepared and circulated on

20 February 7, 2020, for public comment period that ended on March 10, 2020. Several

21 organizations provided comments about the Project's serious potential for displacement.

22 17. A Draft SEIR was subsequently prepared and circulated for public review and

23 comment from July 31, 2020 to September 17, 2020. A public hearing was held on September
24 3, 2020 to receive oral input from agencies and the public on the Draft SEIR. Approximately 20
25 comment letters were received including seven from State and local agencies, and 11 from
26 organizations or individuals. In addition, a public hearing on the Draft SEIR was held on
27 September 2, 2020, and 16 members of the public provided oral comments.

18. The UC approved the Project at its hearing on November 19, 2020, and filed its
2 Notice of Determination ("NOD") with the State Clearinghouse on November 20, 2020.
3 Population, Housing and Displacement Impacts

4 19. The Project is located in direct proximity to Sacramento low-income

5 neighborhoods. Accordingly, several organizations and public agencies commented in response

6 to both the NOP and SEIR that the Project would likely result in displacement of local residents.

7 On this issue SACOG explained:

8 "[A]s a large-scale investment in a historically disadvantaged neighborhood, it is
9 important that we recognize the risk for existing businesses and residents. When there is an influx of new money and people in an area that had one been under-
10 invested in, the incoming change can lead to major disruptions to people's lives, most often in the form of pushing them out. Ensuring that existing neighborhood
11 residents are engaged in a meaningful way and incorporating anti-displacement strategies is one way to promote equitable development and prevent
12 displacement."

13 20. Several commenters stated that the SEIR did not adequately analyze and disclose
14 displacement impacts, much less mitigate such impacts to the extent feasible as CEQA requires.
15 21. The UC acknowledged that the Project may result in displacement, stating in
16 relevant part, "[I]t is reasonably foresecable that an indirect effect of the 2020 LRDP Update
17 could be some level of displacement of existing low-income residents as a result of new

18 investment to meet the demands of employees at the expanded project facilities." This

19 important concession requires the UC to study the issue. (Protect the Historic Amador
20 Waterways V. Amador Water Agency (2004) 116 Cal.App.4th 1099, 1109 ("[I]n preparing an
21 EIR, the agency must consider and resolve every fair argument that can be made about the
22 possible significant environmental effects of a project").)
23 22. While conceding that the Project may reasonably result in displacement, the UC
24 refused to analyze the Project's impact in the SEIR by claiming the Project's displacement
25 effects were "indirect" and therefore purely "social and economic effects" that are outside the
26 scope of CEQA. The UC's legal arguments are incorrect, and do not excuse the SEIR's failure

27 to analyze and disclose displacement impacts.

28
SOLURI
MESERVE 6
A LAW
CORPORATION VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

23. The issue of displacement is squarely within the scope of CEQA. Appendix G to
2 the CEQA Guidelines asks whether & project would "[d]isplace substantial numbers of existing

3 people or housing, necessitating the construction of replacement housing elsewhere?"

4 24. CEQA Guidelines Appendix G does not distinguish between "direct" and

5 "indirect" displacement. Indeed, CEQA provides that both "direct" and "indirect" impacts must

6 be analyzed. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15358.)

7 25. To the extent displacement is somehow considered a "social or economic effect"

8 despite it being expressly included in CEQA Guidelines Appendix G, such issues must

9 nevertheless be analyzed to the extent they cause physical changes in the environment. (CEQA
10 Guidelines, § 15131.) Further, social and economic effects are relevant to determine the

11 significance of a project's physical changes to the environment. (Ibid.)

12 26. Displacement is a population and housing impact that is within the scope of
13 CEQA. It also leads to growth inducement as well as increases in VMT and GHG emissions,
14 which are also within the scope of CEQA. Finally, growth inducement is relevant to determine
15 the significance of impacts to growth inducement, VMT and GHG. Accordingly, the SEIR must
16 analyze and disclose the Project's displacement impacts.

17 Other Project Impacts

18 27. The SEIR's defects are not limited to its failure to analyze and mitigate for
19 displacement or impacts resulting from and related to displacement.

20 28. Effective July 1, 2020, degradation in level of service ("LOS") is no longer
21 considered a significant impact under CEQA. Instead, vehicle miles traveled ("VMT") is one
22 measure to assess transportation impacts along with other considerations such as safety and
23 impacts to transit, pedestrian and bicycle facilities.
24 29. In order to provide guidance to public agencies on the recent change from LOS-
25 based analysis to VMT-based analysis, the Governor's Office of Planning and Research
26 ("OPR") released a Technical Advisory on Evaluating Transportation Impacts under CEQA
27 ("Technical Advisory"), which "contains technical recommendations regarding assessment of
28
SOLURI
MESERVE 7
ALAW
CORPORATION VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 VMT, thresholds of significance, and mitigation measures." The Technical Advisory is neither a

2 regulation nor a part of the CEQA Guidelines.

3 30. The Technical Advisory directly links VMT and GHG, stating in relevant part:

4 VMT and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction. Senate Bill 32 (Pavley, 2016)
5 requires California to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 40 percent below 1990 levels by 2030, and Executive Order B-16-12 provides a target of 80 percent

6 below 1990 emissions levels for the transportation sector by 2050. . The California Air Resources Board (CARB) has provided a path forward for
7 achieving these emissions reductions from the transportation sector in its 2016 Mobile Source Strategy. CARB determined that it will not be possible to achieve

8 the State's 2030 and post-2030 emissions goals without reducing VMT growth.

9 31. Consistent with the need to reduce VMT in order to achieve state policy to reduce

10 GHG emissions, the Technical Advisory recommends a numeric significance threshold of 15
11 percent reduction in VMT from baseline conditions: "In summary, achieving 15 percent lower

12 per capita (residential) or per employee (office) VMT than existing development is both

13 generally achievable and is supported by evidence that connects this level of reduction to the
14 State's emissions goals."

15 32. The SEIR purports to analyze the Project's impacts based on VMT. The SEIR

16 found, "The overall growth in VMT under the 2020 LRDP Update is projected to outpace

17 campus population, leading to an increase in daily per capita VMT," and further, "The 2020

18 LRDP Update would generate additional VMT compared to existing conditions."
19 33. Despite acknowledging that the Project would increase VMT, the SEIR
20 nevertheless finds the impact is less than significant - and thereby proposes no mitigation for
21 VMT impacts - because the Project would be located in an area designated as "low VMT" as
22 mapped by SACOG.

23 34. Even if the Technical Advisory's screening threshold for "residential and office
24 projects" constitutes a CEQA significance standard that is relevant to the Project, compliance
25 with that standard would not excuse the UC's attempt to end the analysis since "[c]ompliance
26 with the threshold does not relieve a lead agency of the obligation to consider substantial
27 evidence indicating that the project's environmental effects may still be significant." (CEQA

2 City of Sacramento (2016) 5 Cal.App.5th 281, 300.) The SEIR's own analysis constitutes

3 substantial evidence that the Project's impact on VMT is significant despite purported

4 compliance with the Technical Advisory's screening threshold for "residential and office
projects."

5 35.

6 The SEIR engaged in similar sleight of hand with respect to GHG emissions.

7 With respect to one of the two significance standards for GHG emissions, the SEIR explains,

8 "Given the seriousness of climate change and the regional significance of the Sacramento

9 Campus, UC Davis has determined that for purposes of this analysis, any increase in GHG

10 emissions above existing conditions (net zero) would result in a significant impact on the
lenvironment." (Emphasis added).)

11 36.

12 The SEIR's seemingly-laudable "net zero" significance standard stands in stark

13 contrast with, and is arbitrary in relation to, California statewide policy of reducing state-wide
greenhouse gas

14 emissions to 1990 levels by the year 2020 (Health and Safety Code § 38550), 40

15 percent below 1990 levels by the 2030 (Health and Safety Code 38566), 80 percent below

16 1990 levels by 2050 (Executive Order S-3-05). (Cleveland National Forest Foundation v. San

17 Diego Assn. of Governments (2017) 3 Cal.5th 497 ["These targets were based on a scientific

18 consensus that climate change was largely caused by human activity resulting in elevated levels

19 of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere and that drastic reductions in
greenhouse gas emissions were required to stabilize the climate"].)

20 37.

21 The need to significantly reduce GHG emissions against baseline conditions is
well understood by the UC. The Draft SEIR acknowledges that "attainment of the state's long-
22 term climate change goal of carbon neutrality (EO B-55-10) will require deep emissions
23 reductions across all sectors."

24 38.

25 While recognizing the need for "deep emissions reductions across all sectors," the

26 UC is arbitrarily assigning for itself a significantly less ambitious standard than required "across

27 all sectors." This arbitrary significance standard further results in considerably less mitigation
for GHG emissions.

28
SOLURI
MESERVE
A LAW 9

CORPORATION VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 39. The prejudice to informed decision-making resulting from the SEIR's arbitrary

2 significance standard is exacerbated by its unsupported assumption of GHG reductions through

3 compliance with the "University's Carbon Neutrality Initiative" as well as reliance on vague,

4 unenforceable and impermissibly-deferred GHG mitigation measures.

5 40. The SEIR does not represent a good faith effort by the UC to analyze and disclose

6 the Project's GHG impacts, much less mitigate those impacts consistent with state GHG policy

7 to the extent feasible.

8 41. Closely related to GHG emissions is CEQA's requirement to analyze a project's

9 use of energy. The CEQA Guidelines require:

10 If analysis of the project's energy use reveals that the project may result in significant
11 environmental effects due to wasteful, inefficient, or unnecessary use of energy, or wasteful use of energy resources, the EIR shall mitigate that energy use. This analysis
12 should include the project's energy use for all project phases and components, including transportation-related energy, during construction and operation. In addition to building
13 code compliance, other relevant considerations may include, among others, the project's size, location, orientation, equipment use and any renewable energy features that could be
14 incorporated into the project.

15 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.2, subd. (b).)
16 42. Contrary to state policy, the SEIR reveals that the Project would result in increased
17 electricity consumption by nearly four-fold, increased onsite gasoline consumption by more than
18 20 percent, and increased natural gas and diesel consumption by more than 10 percent each
19 against baseline conditions. The SEIR proposes no significant infrastructure to increase onsite
20 generation of renewable energy to offset these significant demand increases. Instead, the SEIR
21 doubles-down on its reliance on vague and unsubstantiated mitigation measures - once again,
22 measured against an arbitrary standard that is inconsistent with state policy - to conclude that
23 the impact less than significant.
24 43. With respect to energy use associated with increased VMT emissions in particular,
25 the SEIR repeats its position that the Project would be located in "a low VMT-generating area of
26 the Sacramento region." That a Project is located in a low-VMT area is not mitigation for a
27 Project's incremental energy use associated with its VMT - particularly when the Project will

SOLURI
MESERVE 10
A LAW
CORPORATION VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 admittedly increase its per-capita VMT in relation to existing conditions. The UC's legal

3 position is contrary to state policy: locating a project in a "low-VMT area" is not a license to

4 increase VMT with impunity and further avoid the consequence associated with that increase in

5 energy consumption. Further, the UC's attempt to rely on internal trip capture to "reduce

6 transportation energy" is devoid of any quantification or meaningful analysis.
44.

7 With respect to transportation impacts, Caltrans commented that the Project could

8 negatively impact safety at the U.S. 50 interchange ramps at Stockton Boulevard, and requested

9 that the UC analyze this impact. The UC refused, and even stated that "Caltrans is responsible
for performing this safety analysis" for the Project.

10 45.

11 The City of Sacramento raised similar concerns about the need to ensure safe

12 connections between the Project and City transportation facilities. The City asked the UC to
"identify funding for required improvements, including potentially contributing to any
13 improvements assumed to be constructed by the City, that were the basis for determining project
14 automobile/bicycle conflicts are Less Than Significant." The UC refused.

15 46.

16 The City also identified with specificity the "proposed extension of 3rd Avenue

17 easterly from Stockton Boulevard onto the Stockton Campus," commenting that, "[A]t
minimum, peak hour traffic volume forecasts and signal warrant information needs to be
18  provided to determine the appropriate traffic control device required to address the operations
19

20 and safety at this intersection." The UC refused to disclose this information to the public in the

21 SEIR, stating, "The comment does not allege that the projects will result in unsafe conditions

22 during peak hour but alleges that it must be studied. CEQA does not require a Lead Agency to

23 conduct every recommended test and perform all recommended research to evaluate the impacts
of a project."

24 47. Similar deflection and obfuscation occurred in other

25 resource areas. For example,

26 the Sacramento Metropolitan Air Quality Management District ("SMAQMD") commented that

27 the Draft SEIR did not adequately follow SMAQMD guidance for assessing impacts to criteria

28 pollutants, did not adequately quantify the Project's GHG emissions for purposes of assessing

SOLURI
MESERVE
A LAW 11

CORPORATION VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 GHG impacts, and did not ensure that its GHG mitigation measures were sufficiently

2 enforceable.

3 48. The SMAQMD also shared other commenters' concerns regarding the SEIR's

4 reliance on SACOG screening maps to conclude in cursory fashion that the Project's impact on

5 VMT would be less than significant despite actually increasing VMT, observing, "To fully
6  justify use of these maps to call the project VMT impact less than significant, the SEIR should

7 provide specific and enforceable mitigation measures to ensure its consistency with this low-

8 VMT area. We recommend using Sac Metro Air District's Recommended Guidance for Land

9 Use Emission Reductions v.4.2 (Guidance v4.2) to accomplish this." The UC disregarded this

10 request.

11 49. The UC's refusal to fully comply with Guidance v4.2 is understood in the context

12 of the SMAQMD's later comment, which states "Please note that "Integrate Below Market Rate

13 Housing' is a quantified mitigation measure in Sac Metro Air District's Guidance v4.2" Once

14 again, and consistent with the UC's steadfast refusal to meaningfully address displacement and

15 housing impacts, the UC summarily disregarded this suggested VMT mitigation strategy by
16 asserting, "Below market housing is not currently included in the 2020 LRDP Update."

17 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

18 50. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to

19 Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5.

20 51. Venue is proper in Sacramento Superior Court because the UC is a public officer
21 within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure sections 393, subdivision (b), and the cause of
22 action arose entirely in Sacramento. (Regents of University of California v. Superior Court
23 (1970) 3 Cal.3d 529, 534-543.)

24 52. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section
25 21167, subdivision (b) as the UC filed its notice of determination for the Project on November
26 20, 2020.

- EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

2 53.

3 Petitioner has exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

4 Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to this filing and participated in the

5 administrative process. Petitioner actively participated in the administrative process leading up

6 to the UC's approval of the Project and issuance of a notice of determination, and stated its

7 objections to the UC's actions. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21177, subd. (b).)
54.

8 The UC has taken final agency actions with respect to certifying the SEIR and

9 approving the Project. The UC has a mandatory duty to comply with all state and federal laws,

10 including but not limited to CEQA, prior to undertaking the discretionary actions at issue in this
lawsuit.

11 STANDING

12 55. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims alleged in this Petition because it is
13 beneficially interested in this matter, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1086.

14 Petitioner is a non-profit organization comprised of social justice advocates, equity-focused
15 organizations and community partners and dedicated to support the health and stability of
16 neighborhoods impacted by of large development projects in Sacramento and to create a united
17 voice for local environmental concerns. Also, many of Petitioner's coalition members reside in
18 Sacramento. The growth of the UC Davis Sacramento campus pursuant to the 2020 LRDP will
19

20 have direct impacts on Petitioner and its members. Petitioner's interests have been, are being,

21 and will continue to be adversely affected by the UC's failure to comply with applicable laws,
and by the Project's negative impacts to resources including but not limited to available housing,
22 transportation and public services. Unless the relief requested herein is granted, Petitioner, its
23 members and the environment will be adversely affected and injured by the UC's failure to
24 comply with CEQA in approving the project and certifying the SEIR.
25 56.

26 Petitioner also actively participated in the administrative process conducted by the

27 UC to determine the project's environmental impacts and to ensure the UC complied with

28 CEQA and all other applicable laws in processing the application for the project.

IRREPARABLE HARM

2 57. The UC's failures, set forth in this Petition, constitute a prejudicial abuse of

3 discretion within the meaning of the Code of Civil Procedure and CEQA. (See Code Civ. Proc.,

4 co 1085; Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.)

5 58. Petitioner possesses no other remedy than to challenge the UC's abuse of

6 discretion other than by means of this lawsuit. If the UC's actions concerning the project are

7 effectuated, Petitioner and the environment will be irreparably harmed. No money damages

8 could adequately compensate for that harm.

9 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

10 59. Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil
11 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights

12 affecting the public interest.

13 60. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit on
14 the general public by requiring the UC to carry out its duties under CEQA before approving the
15 project.

16 61. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will also result in the enforcement
17 of important rights affecting the public interest by compelling the UC to engage in a fair,

18 objective, and legally adequate analysis of the project's environmental impacts, and to ensure

19 that the public has a meaningful opportunity to review and comment on these impacts and

20 mitigation measures for that project.

21 62. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make an award

22 of attorney's fees appropriate in this case. Absent enforcement by the Petitioner, the UC will
23 proceed with a project that will cause significant, unmitigated environmental impacts that might
24 otherwise have been reduced or avoided through legally adequate environmental review and the
25 adoption of feasible mitigation measures.

Petitioner elects to prepare the record of proceedings in this action.

8 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

9 Violations of CEQA

10 65. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)

11 Petitioner incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in
Paragraphs 1 through 65 as though fully set forth herein.

12 66.

13 The UC prejudicially abused its discretion in certifying the SEIR. The UC did not

14 proceed in the manner required by law and its decisions in approving the project and certifying

15 the SEIR are not supported by substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5; Vineyard

16 Area Citizens for Responsible Growth 1 City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 426.)
These legal deficiencies include, without limitation, the following:

17

18 Failure to Adequately Analyze Significant Environmental Impacts
67.

19 CEQA requires that an EIR describe the proposed project's significant

20 environmental effects. Each must be revealed and fully analyzed in the EIR. (Pub. Resources

21 Code, § 21100, subd. (b), CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.2, subd. (a).) "[T]he adequacy of an EIR's

22 discussion of environmental impacts is an issue distinct from the extent to which the agency is

23 correct in its determination whether the impacts are significant." (Sierra Club v. County of
Fresno (2018) 6 Cal.5th 502, 514; Cleveland National Forest Foundation v. San Diego Assn. of
24 Governments (2017) 3 Cal.5th 497, 514-515; see also Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay Com. v.
25 Board of Port Cmrs. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1371.) "[W]hether a description of an
26 environmental impact is insufficient because it lacks analysis or omits the magnitude of the
27 impact is not a substantial evidence question. A conclusory discussion of an environmental
28 impact that an EIR deems significant can be determined by a court to be inadequate as SOLURI an

MESERYE
A LAW 15

CORPORATION VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- informational document without reference to substantial evidence." (Sierra Club, supra, 6

2 Cal.5th at 514.) To "comport with its intended function" an EIR must include "detail sufficient

3 to enable those who did not participate in its preparation to understand and to consider

4 meaningfully the issues raised by the proposed project." (Ibid. [internal quotations omitted].)

5 "Whether or not the alleged inadequacy is the complete omission of a required discussion or a
6 patently inadequate one-paragraph discussion devoid of analysis, the reviewing court must
7 decide whether the EIR serves its purpose as an informational document." (Ibid.)

8 68. Here the SEIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, mitigate, and avoid potentially

9 significant impacts, including, but not limited to:

10 a. Population and housing, including displacement;
11 b. Growth inducement;

12 C. Greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions;

13 d. Energy consumption;

14 e. Air emissions;

15 f. Transportation;

16 g. and land use.

17 Failure to Adequately Analyze the Project's Cumulative Impacts

18 69. An EIR must discuss a cumulative impact if the project's incremental effect
19 combined with the effects of other projects is cumulatively considerable. (CEQA Guidelines, §
20 15130, subdivision (a).) In performing cumulative impact analysis, the lead agency must analyze
21 the project's incremental effects in connection with the effects of past projects, other current
22 projects, and probable future projects. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15065, subd. (a)(3).) An EIR must
23 make a reasonable, good faith effort to disclose cumulative impacts. (Citizens for Open Gov't v.
24 City of Lodi (212) 205 Cal.App.4th 296, 320.)
25 70. Here, the EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, mitigate and avoid potentially
26 significant cumulative impacts including, but not limited to:

27 a. Population and housing, including displacement;
28 b. Growth inducement;
SOLURI 16 MESERVE
A LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE CORPORATION

1 C. GHG emissions;

2 d. Energy consumption;

3 e. Air emissions;

4 f. Transportation;

5 g. and land use.

6 Mitigation Measures are Unenforceable, Vague, and Inadequate

7 71. "An EIR shall describe feasible measures which could minimize significant

8 adverse impacts." (CEQA Guidelines § 15126.4(a)(1).) An agency may not approve a project
that will have significant environmental impacts if there are feasible mitigation measures that

10 would substantially lessen those effects. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21002; Cal. Code Regs., tit.
11 14, §§ 15002, subd. (a)(3), 15021, subd. (a)(2).)

12 72. An agency must provide that mitigation measures are fully enforceable through
13 permit conditions, agreements, or other measures. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21081.6, subd. (b).
14 73. The efficacy of a mitigation measure in remedying the identified environmental

15 problem must be apparent in the EIR. (Sierra Club v. County of San Diego (2014) 231

16 Cal.App.4th 1152, 1168; Communities for a Better Env't v. City of Richmond (2010) 184

17 Cal.App.4th 70, 95; Gray v. County of Madera (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1099, 1116; Cleveland

18 Nat'l Forest Found. v. San Diego Ass'n of Gov'ts (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 413, 433.) An EIR
19 must contain facts and analysis disclosing the analytical route the agency traveled from evidence
20 to action, not just the agency's bare conclusions and opinions. (Save Our Peninsula Committee
21 v. Monterey County Bd. of Supervisors (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 99, 118.) An EIR must then
22 describe mitigation measures and explain why they will work. (California Clean Energy
23 Committee v. City of Woodland (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 173, 203.)
24 74. Here, the SEIR fails to include adequate facts and analysis for mitigation measure
25 relied upon to reduce the Project's significant impacts.

26 75. Mitigation measures are also incorporated into the Project description. An EIR
27 cannot incorporate proposed mitigation measures into its project description as a means to then

28 conclude that potential impacts would be less than significant. (Lotus v. Department of
SOLURI
MESERVE 17
A LAW
CORPORATION VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Transportation (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 645,655-656.) Doing so prevents an accurate

2 determination of a measure's effectiveness. (Ibid.)

3 76. Mitigation measures in the EIR are unenforceable, impermissibly vague,

4 inadequate and impermissibly deferred. This includes, but is not limited to, mitigation measures

5 for:

6 a. Population and housing, including displacement;

7 b. Transportation;

8 C. Air emissions;

9 d. GHG emissions;

10 e. Energy usage;

11 f. and cumulative impacts.

12 Findings Not Supported by Substantial Evidence

13 77. The UC's statement of overriding considerations is not supported by substantial

14 evidence because air quality and transportation impacts that are identified as significant and

15 unavoidable may, in fact, be reduced to less than significant through adoption of mitigation

16 measures proposed by public commenters.
