VOLLVHOJNOO 7YNOISSEJONd Y - MVTLY SAENHOLLY 11 INTRODUCTION

RICHARDS WATSON GERSH 12 1. Section 316(b) of the federal Clean Water Act requires that the location,
13 design, construction, and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the best
14 technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. For several decades
15  after passage of the Clean Water Act, various thermal power plants in or near the California
16 coast, including the AES Redondo Beach Generating Station (*RBGS"), have continued to
17 withdraw cooling water from the State's navigable waters, using a single-pass system
18 known as "once-through cooling" or "OTC.3 It is well-documented that these OTC plants
19 and their cooling method cause substantial environmental harm, resulting in detrimental
20| impacts to biological resources and air and water quality.

21 2. Over 10 years ago, Respondent State Water Resources Control Board ("Water
22 Board") adopted the Water Quality Control Policy on the Use of Coastal and Estuarine
23 Waters for Power Plant Cooling ("OTC Policy"), allegedly to implement the requirements
24 of Section 316(b) of the Clean Water Act. The OTC Policy requires OTC power plants to
25 adopt and implement technology-based standards that will address the significant and
26 adverse environmental impacts caused by their cooling systems. Although the OTC Policy
27 originally required the OTC plants in California to comply with the technology-based
28 standards by a specific date, the Water Board has repeatedly, needlessly, and arbitrarily

-2-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

R6900-1068\2594727v3.doc

1 granted compliance date extensions without fully disclosing or analyzing the significant and

3

4 adverse environmental impacts caused by its discretionary actions. The Water Board's
serial extensions of the OTC Policy compliance dates have not only undermined the water
quality objectives of the Clean Water Act, but have also circumvented environmental
5 review and the informational requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act
6 (Pub. Resources Code § 21000, et seq.) ("CEQA") and the CEQA Guidelines (14 Cal. Code
7 Regs. § 15000, et seq.) ("CEQA Guidelines"). The Water Board's ongoing and constant
8 failure to examine, avoid, or reduce the significant environmental impacts resulting from
9 continuous compliance date extensions constitute an abuse of discretion.

10 3.

RICHARDSWATSON GERSHON ATTORNEYS AT LAW - A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATIC This lawsuit challenges the Water Board's latest discretionary action to
11 approve yet another compliance date extension without conducting the required
12 environmental review. On October 19, 2021, the Water Board adopted an amendment to
13 the OTC Policy that authorized additional OTC operations at RBGS for two more years,
14 without fully analyzing, disclosing, or mitigating the adverse environmental impacts of this
15 most recent OTC Policy amendment (the "2021 Amendment"). As a result of the Water
16 Board's discretionary approval of another compliance date extension, RBGS will not cease
17 its environmentally damaging operations on December 31, 2021, but will be allowed to
18 continue operating through December 31, 2023, without achieving full compliance under
19 the OTC Policy.
20 4. Disregarding its legal obligations under CEQA, the Water Board failed to
21 conduct the required subsequent environmental review when it approved the 2021
22 Amendment, and only relied on cursory addendum to a previous substitute environmental
23 document (the "Addendum") that fails to serve as an adequate environmental and
24 informational document. Petitioner alleges that the Water Board's October 19, 2021
25 reliance on the Addendum to its previously prepared substitute environmental document
26 violates multiple provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, including but not limited
27 to the following:

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 The Water Board improperly relied on a 10-year old substitute environmental
2 document as its baseline environmental document and analysis, and failed to
consider new information and substantial evidence showing that there are
D changed circumstances and significant, adverse environmental impacts that
preclude the use of the Addendum;

A The Water Board ignored substantial evidence demonstrating that the 2021
Amendment and its approval of extended operations at RBGS will result in
substantial adverse environmental impacts to air and water quality, biological
9 resources, and marine life, among other environmental impacts;
10 Due to the Water Board's failure to sufficiently analyze and disclose impacts,

NOLLYBOJMO3 TYNOISSLHONd Y - MYT.1Y SAINHOLI RICHARDSWATSON GERSHON 11 the Water Board also failed to impose effective, feasible, and necessary
12 mitigation measures, and failed to consider reasonable alternatives, to reduce
13 such environmental impacts;
14 The Water Board failed to comply with procedural requirements in its
15 adoption of the 2021 Amendment and its approval of the Addendum; and
16 The Water Board failed to find that the Addendum, which was included in the

17 staff report prepared for the Water Board, reflected the Water Board's
18 independent judgment.

19 As a result, the Water Board abused its discretion in that it failed to proceed as
20 required by law, and its purported reliance on the Addendum is not supported by substantial
21 evidence.

22 THE PARTIES

23 5. Petitioner City of Redondo Beach a is a charter city and a municipal
24 corporation located in the County of Los Angeles. Redondo Beach and its constituents and
25 residents have a beneficial interest in the Water Board's lawful performance of its duties,
26 particularly with respect to approval and adoption of an Addendum for a project (i.e., the a
27 2021 Amendment) that a applies expressly to a power plant directly located within Redondo
28 Beach's boundaries. The City and its residents maintain a geographical nexus to the project

Amendment and its authorization of additional OTC operations at RBGS for two more

years.

6. Respondent Water Board is a California state agency that is designated as the
state water pollution control agency for all purposes stated in the Clean Water Act,
6 including water quality control planning and waste discharge regulation. The Water Board

23 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS AND BACKGROUND

Adoption of the OTC Policy

13. On May 4, 2010, the Water Board adopted the OTC Policy which became
24 effective on October 1, 2010. The OTC Policy establishes uniform, technology-based
25 standards to implement Clean Water Act section 316(b), which requires that the location,
26 design, construction, and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the best
27 technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts. Put simply, the OTC
28 ///

I R6900-106812594727v3.doc -6-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Policy was adopted with the explicit purpose of minimizing adverse environmental impacts
2 to marine life resulting from use of coastal and estuarine waters for power plant cooling.

3 14. The OTC Policy was necessary because, as stated in the Water Board's staff
4, report prepared in connection with the OTC Policy Amendment, "Cooling water
withdrawals cause adverse impacts when larger aquatic organisms, such as fish and
6 mammals, are trapped against a facility's intake screens (impingement) and when smaller
7 marine life, such as larvae and eggs, are killed by being drawn through the cooling system

8 and exposed to high pressures and temperatures (entrainment)."
9 15. The OTC Policy applies to certain existing power plants located along the
10 California coast, including RBGS, and is implemented through National Pollutant

JOLLYHOJNOO TYNOISSZHONd Y - MYI LY SAENNOLIV RICHARDS WATSON GERSHON 11 Discharge Elimination System ("NPDES") permits, issued pursuant to Clean Water Act
12 section 402, which authorize the point source discharge of pollutants to navigable waters.
13 16. The OTC Policy establishes a schedule that provides the latest compliance
14 date for the replacement, repowering, or retirement of each remaining power plant still
15 utilizing OTC operations. As originally adopted, the OTC Policy required RBGS and other
16 coastal power plants to effectively eliminate their once-through-cooling systems, or take
17 other measures to achieve compliance, by December 31, 2020.

18 Adoption of Substitute Environmental Document

19 17. The California Natural Resources Agency approved the Water Board's water
20 quality control planning process as a certified regulatory program to satisfy CEQA
21 requirements for preparing environmental documents, pursuant to 23 Cal. Code. Regs.
22 section 3777. (See also 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15251(g).) Although certified regulatory
23 programs are exempt from the CEQA requirements for preparation of an initial study,
24 negative declaration, or environmental impact report, an agency engaging in a project that
25 falls within the scope of a certified regulatory program must nevertheless prepare a
26 substitute environmental document ("SED") to fully disclose and examine the significant
27 environmental impacts of the proposed project, and must comply with CEQA's policy goals
28 and substantive standards.

• 18. In approving the OTC Policy, the Water Board prepared and certified an SED
2 as the required environmental documentation when it adopted the OTC Policy. The Board
3 adopted the final SED for the OTC Policy on May 4, 2010 (the "2010 SED").

4

6 Prior OTC Policy Extensions Without Adequate Environmental Review
19.

7 Since it adopted the OTC Policy in 2010, the Water Board has approved
multiple compliance date extensions for various OTC plants, each time alleging that the
extension would not result in additional environmental impacts beyond the environmental
8 impacts examined in the 2010 SED. Thus, despite having extended the OTC Policy

RICHARDS WATSON GERSHON 9 compliance date on multiple occasions, and authorizing additional OTC operations at
10

ATTORNEYS AT LAW - A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATIO 11

12 multiple plants, the Water Board has never fully analyzed the adverse environmental
impacts resulting from this series of discretionary actions.
20. Petitioner long awaited the original compliance deadline of December 31,
13 2020, for RBGS to cease its environmentally harmful operations, including the emission of
14 air pollutants through its black, billowing smoke which contaminates the surrounding
15 environment and adversely affects the health and well-being of residents, employees, and
16 visitors in Redondo Beach. On September 1, 2020, however, the Water Board adopted an
17 OTC policy amendment (the *2020 Amendment") that extended the OTC Policy
18 compliance deadline of December 31, 2020 for one year (until December 31, 2021) for
19 RBGS, and for three additional years for three other plants. In approving the 2020
20 Amendment, the Water Board expressly acknowledged that it had only granted a one-year
21 extension to RBGS in response to multiple environmental concerns expressed by Redondo
22 Beach.

23 21. As it had done previously, the Water Board approved the 2020 Amendment
24 without the required environmental review, again alleging that the OTC Policy compliance
25 date extension would not result in additional environmental impacts, and dispensing with
26 any substantive environmental review except for a two-page addendum contained in the
27 staff report for the amendment.

2 The 2021 Amendment and Purported Environmental Review

22. In 2021, the Water Board continued its pattern of perpetually granting OTC
3 Policy compliance date extensions and circumventing the necessary environmental review.
4 As part of its serial extensions, on October 19, 2021, the Water Board adopted the 2021
5 Amendment and extended the OTC Policy compliance deadline of December 31, 2021 for
6 RBGS for two additional years, through December 31, 2023.

7 23. In approving the 2021 Amendment, the Water Board alleged that its
authorization for additional OTC operations at RBGS for two more years would not result

ATTORNEYS AT LAW - A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATIO RICHARDS WATSON GERSHOI 9 in further environmental impacts other than those analyzed in the 2010 SED, and that no
10 environmental review was required. Instead, the Water Board purported to rely on an

12 24. 11 Addendum to the 2010 SED as the environmental review for the OTC Policy Amendment.
The Addendum was contained in the Water Board staff report prepared for
13 the October 19, 2021 public hearing and only provided a brief overview of CEQA
14 regulations and the environmental findings included in the 2010 SED. Despite evidence of
15 new environmental impacts to biological resources, marine life, and air and water quality,
16 the Addendum summarily concluded that the 2021 Amendment will not result in additional
17 environmental impacts, and that a subsequent environmental document was not required.
18 The Amendment neither disclosed nor examined any adverse environmental impacts
19 resulting from the OTC compliance date extension for RBGS.
20

21 25. COMPLIANCE WITH PREREQUISITES
Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to the filing of this
22 lawsuit, and has fully exhausted its administrative remedies by participating in the Water
23 Board's administrative processes related to the 2021 Amendment and the Water Board's
24 purported Addendum, to the extent that those processes were available, including the
25 submittal of letters by the City and its consultants to the Water Board on inter alia July 16,
26 2021 and October 12, 2021, and testimony and PowerPoint presentations by the City and by

28 hearing. 27 its energy, water quality and air quality consultants at the October 19, 2021 Water Board

26. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law unless the Court
2 grants the requested relief. In the absence of the requested relief, the Water Board's
3 amendment to the OTC Policy will result in RBGS continuing to pollute the air and cause
4 water quality impacts for two more years.
27. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 and,
6 prior to filing this lawsuit, has served upon the Water Board notice of its intent to file this
7 lawsuit. A copy

8 28. of that notice is attached as Exhibit A.

This lawsuit has been commenced within any applicable time limits as set
9 forth in the California Code of Civil Procedure and California Public Resources Code.

12 (Failure to Comply with the CEQA)

13 (Writ of Mandate [C.C.P. § 1085] against Respondent Water Board)
29.

14 Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations of paragraphs 1 through

15 28 as though fully set forth herein.

30.

16 The Water Board is required to conduct adequate environmental review prior

17 to making any formal decision regarding projects subject to CEQA, including the 2021

18 Amendment. CEQA imposes upon the Water Board a clear, present, and mandatory duty

19 to adequately analyze and mitigate adverse environmental impacts resulting from the 2021

20 Amendment and the extension of time for compliance by RBGS.
31.

21 •The Water Board purported to comply with CEQA by preparing an

22 Addendum to the 2010 SED (CEQA Guidelines 15164) as the environmental review for

23 the 2021 Amendment. CEQA, however, provides that an Addendum to a previously

24 certified environmental document may be used only where some changes or additions are

25 necessary to the prior environmental document but none of the conditions set forth in

26 CEQA Guidelines section 15162 have been met.

32.

27 CEQA Guidelines section 15162 provides that a subsequent environmental a
document must be prepared when:

8 (3) New information of substantial importance, which was not known and could not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the previous [environmental document was certified or adopted], shows any of the following:

10 (A) The project will have one or more significant effects not discussed in the previous [environmental document];

RICHARDS WATSON GERSHON ATTORNEYS AT LAW - A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION 11
12 (B) Significant effects previously examined will be substantially more severe than shown in the previous [environmental document];

13 (C) Mitigation measures or alternatives previously found not to be

14 feasible would in fact be feasible and would substantially reduce one or more significant effects of the project, but the project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative; or

15

16 (D) Mitigation measures or alternatives which are considerably different from those analyzed in the previous [environmental

17 document] would substantially reduce one or more significant effects on the environment, but the project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative.

18 33.

19 Here, the record shows that several conditions make CEQA Guidelines

20 section 15162 applicable. Among other things, the record shows that substantial changes

21 with respect to the circumstances under which the project (the 2021 Amendment) is

22 undertaken have occurred since the 2010 SED was adopted, and new information of

23 substantial importance, which was not known and could not have been known with the

24 exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the 2010 SED was adopted, shows that the

25 2021 Amendment will have impacts not previously analyzed, more significant than

26 previously analyzed, and that new and different mitigation measures would substantially

27 reduce significant effects on the environment.
34.

28 For example, the 2010 SED states: "State Water Board staff cannot accurately
assess air quality impacts related to criteria pollutants because it is difficult to estimate the

-11-

R6900-106812594727v3.doc PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

method of compliance for each facility." Yet, at the time of the October 19, 2021 meeting,

2 the Water Board had more than 10 years' worth of data to consider since it adopted the

3 2010 SED. New evidence about air quality impacts from the OTC facilities, which was

4 not known in 2010, reveals previously unanalyzed environmental impacts that were
required to be evaluated, including multiple and ongoing air quality permit violations at

6 RBGS that have harmed, and continue to harm, the health and safety of Redondo Beach

7 residents and visitors. Among other new information, evidence relating to short-term

8 emissions of criteria pollutants, as a well as a significant change in the annual criteria
pollutant emissions at RBGS, required subsequent environmental review.

10 35. Furthermore, greenhouse gas emissions ("GHGs") resulting directly from the

RICHARDS WATSON GERSHON NOLLYJOdBOO TYNOISS2408d Y - MV1 LV SA3NBOLIA 11 continued operation of the power plant has not been analyzed or disclosed. California's

12 clear statutory mandates require the reduction of GHGs now and on a go-forward basis;

13 the Water Board not only has failed to demonstrate how the 2021 Amendment complies
14 with these obligations, it failed to conduct any analysis of the issue at all, in violation of

15 CEQA.

16 36. The Water Board also failed to analyze and disclose other changes in
17| conditions at RBGS since 2010, including but not limited to the determination that
18 approximately 5.93 acres of jurisdictional wetlands exists at the site and serve as habitat

19 for wildlife, and that the continued operation of RBGS would result in significant
20 environmental harm to this sensitive environmental resource. In fact, on May 26, 2020,

21 the California Coastal Commission issued a Notice of Violation to AES Redondo Beach

22 for violations of the California Coastal Act (Pub. Resources Code § 30000, et seq.) and the

23 Redondo Beach Local Coastal Program. The Notice of Violation identified the following

24 violations: "Unpermitted development including but not limited to the unpermitted

25 installation and operation of water pumps for the purpose of groundwater dewatering

26 affecting approximately 5.93 acres of wetlands at the former tank portion of the site;

27 unpermitted installation and operation of water pumps in the vault area."

28 ///

|| R6900-106812594727v3.doc

37. In short, the Water Board failed to consider new information and substantial

2 evidence showing that there are significant environmental impacts resulting from the

3 extended operation of RBGS beyond its amended compliance date of December 31, 2021,
and more effective mitigation measures to reduce such environmental impacts.

5 38. The Water Board's failure to disclose, analyze, and mitigate significant
environmental impacts will result in more marine life will be killed and harmful air
pollution emitted into the densely populated South Bay communities of Redondo Beach

8 and other surrounding cities.
39. As a result of all of the foregoing, the Water Board has violated its duties
10 under law, engaged in a prejudicial abuse of discretion, failed to proceed in the manner

RICHARDS WATSON GERSHON NOLLVBOUB0 TVNOISSEJOld Y - MY1 LY SA3NSOLIY 11 required by law, and decided the matters complained of without the support of any
12 substantial evidence.

13 40. Petitioner has incurred attorneys' fees in preparing and filing this lawsuit and
14 will incur attorneys' fees in an amount not yet known in prosecuting this lawsuit and this
15 cause of action.
