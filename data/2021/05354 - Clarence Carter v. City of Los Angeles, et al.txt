Petition & Complaint

F Plaintiff and Petitioner Clarence Carter ("Plaintiff*) alleges:

2 FACTS APPLICABLE TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION

1.

4 This case concerns the City of Los Angeles and its subsidiary entities' ("the
City's") plan to replace a neighborhood Ramada Inn in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Venice
with a homeless shelter to be licensed for a 55-year period. The City has inappropriately labeled
6 this "interim." Hereafter, this proposal is referred to as "the Project."

7 2.

8 Plaintiff Clarence Carter is a resident of Venice, a member of the Venice

9 Neighborhood Council, and a member of the ad hoc neighborhood group Families First Venice,
which opposes this proposed project based on the significant impacts to aesthetics, public safety
10 and public and environmental health from the facility and from the inevitable homeless
11 encampments that will sprout up around the 33-room facility. Plaintiff brings this action on
12 behalf of the neighborhood and the general public and acts as a private attorney general to confer

13 significant benefit on the general public or a large class of persons under Code of Civil
14 Procedure section 1021.5.

15 3. The City considered this Project in March and April of 2021. It filed its Notice of
16 Exemption with the State's ceganet database on April 28, 2021, and this case is therefore timely.

17 .4.

18 The location of the Project is at 3130 Washington Blvd., Los Angeles, CA. 90292,
at the former site of a Ramada Inn. The City bought the Ramada in and deeded it to Real Party
19 in Interest PATH for use as a homeless shelter. a

20 5.

21 Defendant and Respondent City of Los Angeles is a municipal corporation which
has sponsored the Project. City is also a Real Party in Interest.

22 6. Defendant and Respondent the City of Los Angeles Bureau of Engineering is the
23 first entity which reviewed the proposed Project.

24 7. Defendant and Respondent the City of Los Angeles Board of Public Works was
25 the entity to whom Plaintiff appealed this matter, by and through Families First Venice and those
26 associated with that entity.

27 8.

28 Collectively, these City entities and the City are referred to as the City.

Petition & Complaint 2

1 9.

2 On information and belief, and based on the advice of the City Attorney's Office

3 to citizens in this matter, the decisions of the Bureau of Engineering and the Board of Public

4 Works on the Project are not appealable to the City Council, and are subject to direct review.

10. The City itself is also a Real Party in Interest, as is the entity to which the City
5 deeded the Ramada Inn, People Assisting the Homeless (hereafter, "PATH").

6 11. The Venice neighborhood already has a significant homeless crime problem.
7 Since October of last year alone, there have been at least three murders of senior citizens in
8 Venice at the hands of the local homeless population.

9 12. The proposed Project follows on a failed larger facility known as "A Bridge
10 Home Pacific Sunset" licensed by the exact same operator. In fact there were approximately 114

11

12 calls to 911 from the Sunset Bridge Home in the first six months of operation of the facility.

13. This is not surprising, since the City requires that PATH may not require its
13 tenants to be employed.or sober. Plaintiff alleges - and alleged before the City - that there are
14 innumberable potential impacts to the environment that the Project may have.

15 14. Despite these impacts, the City filed a Notice of Exemption under the California
16 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") with respect to this Project.

17 15.

18 Defendants' Notice of Exemption is fundamentally incorrect because it relies on
two sources which provide no support for this Project.
19

20 The Notice of Exemption relies on state CEQA Guidelines section 15269(c), which is an

21 exemption for "emergency" projects. The present project does not constitute an
emergency under the Guideline.
22

23 The Notice of Exemption relies on Public Resources Code section 21080(b)(4), which

24 also states that it is for "[s]pecific actions necessary to prevent or mitigate an
emergency." The present Project is not an emergency under the statute.

25

26 The Notice of Exemption relies on Health & Safety Code section 50675.1.2. However, to

27 qualify for the exemption from CRQA there stated, the Project would have to be "funded

28 pursuant to Section 50675.1.1." The present Project is not so funded, as all its funds
appear to come from the City of Los Angeles itself, and not from the State.
Petition & Complaint U

2

1 16. The City therefore completely failed in its duty to conduct any CEQA review

2 whatsoever for the Project.

3 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
4 FAILURE TO CONDUCT CEQA REVIEW
(Against All Defendants)
5 17. Plaintiff incorporates paragraphs 1 through 16 above.
6 18. A public entity such as the City of Los Angeles and its subsidiary entities must
7 determine if there is any substantial evidence that a project may have a significant impact on the
8 environment, and if there is, it must prepare an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"). The City
9 failed to prepare an EIR.
10 19. IS Even if there is no substantial evidence of a significant impact, a public entity
11 such as the City of Los Angeles and its subsidiary entities must prepare a negative declaration or
12 a mitigated negative declaration. The City failed to prepare a negative declaration in this case.
13 20. The City must be ordered to comply with CEQA and to invite the public
14 participation, pursuant to CEQA, which it failed to invite thus far.
15 WHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for judgment against all Defendants for:
16

17 The Court's peremptory writ of mandate setting aside the Notice of Exemption,

18 The Court's order that the City must comply with CEQA with respect to the Project, including preparing an initial study, and then an EIR if such an EIR is in
19 fact required,

20 The Court's order mandating a return on the writ once the City has complied with the Court's other orders,
21 For a judgment enforcing the duty imposed by CEQA to adopt a feasible
22 enviropmentally superior alternative to reduce impacts in any subsequent actions taken with respect to the Project,
23 For costs of suit including attorney's fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
24 section 1021.5 and other provisions of law, and

25 Such other relief as the Court deems jus
