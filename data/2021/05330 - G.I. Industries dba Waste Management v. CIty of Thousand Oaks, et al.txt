VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

INTRODUCTION 1

2 1. The purpose of the Ralph M. Brown Act (Gov. Code, § 54950 et seq.) is to facilitate
3 public participation in local government decisions and to curb misuse of the democratic process by
4 secret legislation by public bodies. The Act has been interpreted to mean that, with limited exception, LH3 : 3dAL
5| all of the deliberative processes by legislative bodies, including discussion, debate and the acquisition
6 of information, be open and available for public scrutiny. As such, at least 72 hours prior to a regular a
3 7 meeting, an agenda must be posted which contains a brief general description of each item to be
ZE:80:0L 8 discussed and acted on by the body at the meeting. The purpose for this requirement is to inform
interested members of the public about the subject matter under consideration SO that they can
* 10 determine whether to monitor or participate in the meeting of the body. Respondent/Defendant botched Ventura Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 05-25-2021 11 the Brown Act as alleged herein and prevented interested members of the public from participating in a
12 decision vital to the public welfare and the physical environment.

13 2. Consequently, through this action Petitioner G.I. INDUSTRIES, a Utah corporation, dba
14 WASTE MANAGEMENT ("Petitioner" or "WM") seeks a writ of mandate a and injunctive relief
15 against Respondents CITY OF THOUSAND OAKS and CITY OF THOUSAND OAKS CITY
16 COUNCIL ("City" or "Respondents"), and Real Party in Interest ARAKELIAN ENTERPRISES, INC., Z26LSAISZGOLZ DATE PAID : 05/25/21 12:20 PM TOTAL : 435.
17 dba ATHENS SERVICES (*Athens") (collectively "Respondents"), for violation of the Ralph M. #

18 Brown Act ("Brown Act" or "Act") (Gov. Code, § 54950 et seq.) related to the City's March 9, 2021,
19 adoption of a Notice of Exemption ("NOF') under the California Environmental Quality Act
20 ("CEQA") (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.) for the approval of a Collection Services Agreement
21 for the Provision of Residential and Commercial Solid Waste, Recyclable Materials and Organic Waste
22 Collection Services executed between the City and Athens (the "Exclusive Franchise Agreement" or
23  "Project").

24 3. The City's approval of the Exclusive Franchise Agreement granted Athens the exclusive
25 right to collect and haul municipal solid waste (*MSW"), recyclable materials, and organic waste from
26 commercial businesses and residential uses within the Çity of Thousand Oaks for 15-years with the
27 potential for two five-year extensions. The Project approval requires various improvements within the Ldl3038 V.LA-WM-NO-L89+9900-LZOZ-99# ESVO

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 of "the whole of the project." If allowed to remain in place despite the City's CEQA and Brown Act
2 violations, the Exclusive Franchise Agreement becomes effective January 1, 2022.

3 4. WM separately challenged the City's approval of the Exclusive Franchise Agreement

4 and adoption of the NOE for violations of CEQA. That matter is pending before the Honorable Ronda
5 McKaig, Department 41, of the Ventura County Superior Court (Case No. 56-2021-00553340-CU-
6 WM-VTA). Due to the differing timing requirements set forth in CEQA and the Brown Act, the causes
Z 7 of action under the two statutes could not be filed concurrently. Petitioner filed a Notice of Related case
ZE:80:0L 8 concurrent with this Petition.

5. The City violated the Brown Act by omitting any reference in its Revised Agenda,
t
LZOZ-S7-gO pemlwgns /esjege Court Accepted through Ventura Superior 10 posted March 4, 2021, for a Regular City Council meeting, of the Council's intent to adopt a NOE
11 under CEQA. In fact, the Revised Agenda omitted any reference to CEQA compliance for approval of
12 the Project. (See San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 1167,
13 1179 [finding county violated the Brown Act by considering and adopting a Mitigated Negative
14| Declaration ("MND") for a project subject to a CEQA without first expressly including the MND as an
15| item in the posted agenda for the Planning Commission] ("San Joaquin Raptor Rescue").) Petitioner is
16 unaware of any exception excusing the City from complying with the Brown Act's agenda and noticing
17 requirements. The Council's actions ensured that there was no chance for serious input on a decision
18 that would impact residents of the City and Santa Paula, among others, for over a decade.

19 6. Instead of including CEQA and the NOE in its posted March 4th Agenda, the City
20 waited until 3:30 p.m. on the day of the City Council hearing to disclose the exemptions upon which it
21 proposed to rely under CEQA. Because the City Council hearing started at 6:00 p.m., the City's
22 approach allowed the public and interested stakeholders, including WM, only 2 ½ hours to provide

23 comment on the appropriateness of the CEQA exemptions. Worse yet, due to COVID-19 and the
24 additional public hearing restrictions imposed by the City, the public was required to complete and
25 submit an online Speaker Form before 5:00 p.m. to be allowed to speak at the hearing; thereby
26 providing only 1 ½ hours for review of the CEQA exemptions. The NOE itself was not made publicly
27 available until March 15, 2021, when it was posted with the Ventura County Clerk and Recorder's CASE #:56-2021-00554581-CU-WM-VTA RECEIPT #: 1210525D57972 DATE PAID : 05/25/21 L43: 3dAl 00°98t: TVLOL Wd OZZI

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 office. The City's actions made it as inconvenient as possible for potential speakers to provide
2 meaningful input.

3 7. Furthermore, less than 72 hours before the March 9, 2021 hearing, the City Council was
4 provided with numerous "Supplemental Information Packet(s)," including at 3:30 p.m., a Supplemental
5 Information Packet containing a two-page memorandum from the City Public Works Director to the

6

$ City Manager recommending--for the first time that the City Council find adoption of the Exclusive

ZE:80:0L 7 Franchise Agreement exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines sections 15301, 15308 and
8 15061(b)(3)key information for the City Council's action and previously hidden from the public.

8.

H Without notice that the City Council would also take action under CEQA at the March 9,

Ventura Jouedns Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 05-25-2021 10 2021, hearing, and without access to the additional recommendation made by the Public Works
11 Director, WM and the public were denied an opportunity to prepare and provide meaningful comment
12 on the adequacy of the NOE, a matter of public importance by the City Council that was elected to

13 serve them.

14 9. The Brown Act, also known as the California open meeting law, has a clear and
15 forcefully stated purpose: "In enacting this chapter, the Legislature finds and declares that the public
16 commissions, boards and councils and the other public agencies in this State exist to aid in the conduct
17 of the people's business. It is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their
18 deliberations be conducted openly. [1] The people of this State do not yield their sovereignty to the
19 agencies which serve them. The people, in delegating authority, do not give their public servants the
20 right to decide what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to know. The people
21 insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created."
22 (Gov. Code, § 54950.)

23 10. "To accomplish these vital goals, the Brown Act, inter alia, (1) requires that an agenda
24 be posted at least 72 hours before a regular meeting and (2) forbids action on any item not on that
25 agenda. In this way, *[t]he [Brown] Act . . serves to facilitate public participation in all phases of
26 local government decisionmaking and to curb misuse of the democratic process by secret legislation of
27 public bodies.™ (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue, supra, 216 Cal.App.4th at p. 1176 [citations omitted].)

11. As the courts have stated, the purpose of the Brown Act is to facilitate public

participation in local government decisions and to curb misuse of the democratic process by secret
2 legislation by public bodies. (Cohan v. City of Thousand Oaks (1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 547, 555 [finding
3 violation of the Brown Act and due process when the City amended its City Council meeting agenda

4 without the required 72-hour notice in order to consider an appeal].)

5 12. Petitioner seeks a writ of mandate requiring the City to rescind, void, and vacate the

6 approval of the Exclusive Franchise Agreement and adoption of the NOE on the basis that the City
‡ 7 violated the Brown Act. (Gov. Code, §§ 54960, 54960.1.). L3 : 3dAl 00°G&: 7VIOL
ZE:80:0L 8 13. Petitioner also prays for appropriate injunctive relief to prevent the City from taking &

9 further action to implement, or proceed with implementation of, the Exclusive Franchise Agreement
d 10 during the pendency of this litigation and prior to complying with the Brown Act.
Ventura Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 05-25-2021 11 PARTIES

12 14. Petitioner G.I. Industries, dba Waste Management ("WM"), is a corporation organized
13 under the laws of the State of Utah and registered to do business in California since 1987 (California
14 Corporation No. C1596403). WM operates in, and currently provides, MSW collection and recycling
15 services to businesses and residents of the City of Thousand Oaks. WM was involved in the public
16 process, commenting on all available aspects of the Franchise Agreement approval at every
17 opportunity. Employees of WM include individuals who live and pay taxes in the City of Thousand
18 Oaks and the City of Santa Paula and who have an interest in the City's compliance with the Brown
19 Act. Accordingly, WM and its employees have a direct and beneficial interest in the City's compliance
20 with CEQA and the Brown Act. These interests are directly and adversely affected by the City's failure
21 to comply with the Brown Act, as set forth in this Petition. The maintenance and prosecution of this
22 | action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by remedying the City's Brown Act violations and
23| ensuring the Act's purpose of ensuring publio participation in government is achieved.

24 15. Respondent City of Thousand Oaks is a general law city incorporated under the laws of
25 the State of California and is subject to the requirements of the Brown Act.

26 16. Respondent City of Thousand Oaks, City Council, is the duly elected legislative body
27 for the City of Thousand Oaks that took the actions subject to this lawsuit. CASE #:56-2021-00554581-CU-WM-VTA RECEIPT #: LZ/ST/GO : AIVd ELVO 726L9G9ZGOLZI 12:20

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

38. On or about March 5, 2021, WM submitted a comment letter to the City raising, among
2 other issues, WM's concern that the City had not considered the potentially significant adverse
3 environmental effects that could result to the physical environment under CEQA if the Exclusive
Franchise Agreement were adopted and a change in the existing service providers approved. Numerous
other comments were received by the City from stakeholders opposed to the recommended transition of

ã 6 services to Athens on various grounds including failure to comply with CEQA.

39.

ZE:80:0L At 3:30 p.m. on the day of the City Council hearing, City staff released a "Supplemental
8 Information Packet" containing a conclusory two-page analysis recommending that the Council adopt a

t NOE under CEQA and rely on the Class "Existing Facilities" categorical exemption (CEQA

Jouedns emmjue Court Accepted through LZOZ-GZ-SO pegiuqns Äiesjjege 10 Guidelines, § 15301), the Class 8 "Actions by Regulatory Agencies for Protection of the Environment"
11 categorical exemption (CEQA Guidelines, § 15308), and the rarely invoked "common sense"
12 exemption pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15061, subdivision (b)(3).

13 40. WM, the public, and other interested stakeholders were prejudiced by the defective
14 Agenda because it omitted notice of the City's CEQA action for purposes of approving the Project as
15 required by the Brown Act. The City also deprived the public and Petitioner of due process and an
16 adequate opportunity to exhaust their administrative remedies under CEQA.

17 41. WM and other interested stakeholders therefore lacked the information and time
18 necessary to meaningfully comment on the inappropriateness of the selected exemptions and exhaust
19 their administrative remedies. Nonetheless, WM and other interested stakeholders commented at the
20 hearing on the environmental review process to the extent practicable and based on the limited
21 information that was made publicly available at the time.

22 42. At various points during the March 9, 2021, 9, City Council hearing Athens representatives
23 stated that its vehicle and hauling yard might be located in Santa Paula, Sun Valley, or even "other

24 options." Alternatively, representatives of Athens stated they would use its existing TS/MRF yard in
25 Sun Valley if needed. None of the potential effects from the referenced alternative sites, or Sun Valley,
26 were considered in the staff report or the NOE as part of the "whole of the project" as required by

27 CEQA.

11 (Violation of Brown Act, Gov. Code, § 54954.2)

12 48. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
13| their entirety.

14 49. Respondents violated the Brown Act by failing to post, at least 72 hours before the
15 March 9, 2021 City Council hearing, an agenda containing a brief general description of each item of

16 business to be transacted or discussed at the meeting relating to the City Council's consideration of the
17 Exclusive Franchise Agreement, including the Council's discussion and consideration of CEQA and
18 adoption of the NOE. The March 4, 2021 Revised Agenda omitted any reference to CEQA whatsoever,

19 including which categorical exemptions the City proposed to rely on for compliance with CEQA prior
20 to approval of the Exclusive Franchise Agreement.

21 50. The "Supplemental Information Packet," released merely 2 ½ hours prior to the March
22 9, 2021 hearing, was insufficient notice of the City Council's intended CEQA actions in lieu of proper

23 notice in the agenda. (See San Joaquin Raptor Rescue, supra, 216 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1175-1177
24|| [upholding trial court finding that the County violated the Brown Act because the Commission took

Re: Brown Act Cure and Correct/Cease and Desist Letter, City Council
Meeting, March 9, 2021, Agenda Item No. 9(A) and decision to adopt a
notice of exemption (NOE) pursuant to CEQA

Dear Mayor Bill-de la Pena and Honorable City Councilmembers:
We submit this letter on behalf of G.I. Industries dba Waste Management (WM), to notify the City Council and its Clerk of violations of the Brown Act and City Municipal Code at its March 9, 2021 public meeting. Specifically, the Council violated the Ralph M. Brown Act (Gov. Code, § 54950 et seq.) and its own City Code related to approval of the Exclusive Solid Waste Franchise Agreement, Agenda Item No. 9(A), because: (1) the Council acted on an item - adoption of a notice of exemption (NOE) • not on its agenda for the meeting; and (2) the Council considered documents provided to

same time. it less than 72 hours prior to the meeting that were not made available to the public at the OZ:ZI IZ/9Z/SO: OIVd ELVO ZZ6L9OSTSOLZI PM TOTAL : 435.00 TYPE : EFT
#

I. Cure and Correct: The Agenda for the March 9, 2021 City Council Meeting Violated the Brown Act.

The City Council violated the Brown Act on March 9, 2021 by voting to adopt a Notice of Exemption (NOE) pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.) prior to adopting the Franchise Agreement and without adequate notice to the public as part of the posted agenda for the
meeting. (See Exhibit A [Revised Agenda Posted 3/4/21 for March 9, 2021 City Council
Meeting], listing only consideration of the Solid Waste Franchise Agreement Award.)
The Brown Act requires a posted agenda to include a description of each item of business to be considered at a legislative body's meeting at least 72-hours prior to the
meeting. (Gov. Code, $ 54954.2, subd. (a)(1).) This requirement applies unless the legislative body makes certain determinations, none of which were made by the Council CASE #:56-2021-00554581-CU-WM-VTA RECEIPT¡

Honorable City Councilmembers April 8, 2021

in this case. (See id., § 54954.2, subd.(b).) The Brown Act states that "[n]o action or discussion shall be undertaken on any item not appearing on the posted agenda . (See § 54954.2, subd. (a)(2).)

In adopting the Brown Act, the Legislature declared that:

3
ZE:80:0L [T]he public commissions, boards and councils and the other public agencies in this State exist to aid in the conduct of the people's business. It is the intent of the law that their actions be taken openly and that their deliberations be conducted openly. The people of this State do not yield their sovereignty to the agencies which serve them. The people, in

Iouedns emnquen Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 05-25-2021 delegating authority, do not give their public servants the right to decide
what is good for the people to know and what is not good for them to
know. The people insist on remaining informed so that they may retain control over the instruments they have created.

(Gov. Code, § 54950.)

In this same spirit, the City's Municipal Code similarly requires that: "An agenda shall be prepared and, as required by State law, posted for all meetings. No Council substantive action shall be taken on any matter unless that matter appears on the agenda or such non-agenda action is authorized under the Brown Act. However, for any item not appearing on the agenda, any Councilmember may briefly respond to comments or
questions of the public, briefly report on his or her own activities, request information
from staff or request the matter be placed on a future agenda." (Municipal Code, 1-
8.106 [emphasis added].)

The City Council committed the same violation of the Brown Act here as the
agency in San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced (2013) 216 ZiZL IZISZ/SO : aIVd ELVO ZL6ZSASZSOLZI PM TOTAL : 435.00 TYPE: EFT

Cal.App.4th 1167 (" San Joaquin Raptor"). In that case, the Court of Appeal found that *#

the county had violated the Brown Act by considering and adopting a mitigated negative declaration (MND) for a project subject to CEQA without first expressly including the item in the posted agenda for the Planning Commission. As an individual item of business, the court reasoned, the MND had to be expressly disclosed on the agenda; it was not sufficient for the agenda to merely reference the project in general. Because the planning commission discussed and adopted the MND at its meeting without timely posting it on the agenda, it violated the Brown Act. (Gov. Code, § 54954.2, subd. (a)(1) & (2); see also Exhibit B [true and correct copy of the decision].)

The Court emphasized that a public agency's decision whether to adopt or certify a CEQA document is always a matter of at a least potential public interest since it would
concern the local environmental effects of a proposed project. "Such issues often
motivate members of the public to participate in the process and have their voices heard.
Of course, that is exactly what the Brown Act seeks to facilitate." (San Joaquin Raptor, supra, 216 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1170, 1177-1178.) CASE #:56-2021-00554581-CU-V V.LA-W RECEIPT:

Honorable City Councilmembers

Here, the Council voted a to adopt a NOE in an attempt to comply with CEQA prior to acting on the Franchise Agreement - without announcing on the agenda that it was to consider this new (NOE/CEQA) item of business. The City Council Agenda

‡ omitted any reference to CEQA compliance, including on which specific categorical or other exemption(s) the City proposed to rely.

ZE:80:0L The proposed CEQA action was first made public as part of a memo from the
Public Works Director to the City Manager included in one of many "Supplemental

* Information Packet(s)" posted on the City's website the same afternoon as the City

Jouedns enquen Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 05-25-2021 Council hearing. Specifically, the exemptions were first disclosed around 3:30 p.m. on March 9th. This omission prejudiced the public and our clients' ability to consider the City's alleged CEQA compliance, and to exhaust any concerns related to the appropriateness of the City's specific CEQA exemption determinations.
Participatory democracy, in which constituents are fully informed and therefore
enabled to meaningfully comment on elected officials' proposed actions, is one of the cornerstones of our nation. The City violated this fundamental right of the public when it waited until the 11th hour - on the day of the City Council hearing - to disclose the exemptions the City proposed to rely on under CEQA; thus, eliminating any environmental review of the direct and indirect effects of the Franchise Agreement. This approach prevented interested parties from fully participating in the City Council's decision. Accordingly, pursuant to Government Code section 54960.1, G.I./WM demands that the City Council cure and correct the illegally taken action by setting aside the approvals issued on March 9, 2021 with respect to Agenda Item No. 9(A), including but not limited to rescinding adoption of the Franchise Agreement awarded to Arakelian Enterprises, Inc. dba Athens Services, and rescinding adoption of the NOE, until the agenda for these actions is properly prepared and posted to inform the public of the subjects for discussion at the hearing. 1210525D57972 DATE PAID : 05/25/21 12:20 PM TOTAL : 435.00 TYPE: EFT
#*

If the violation is not cured or corrected within 30 days, G.I./WM will be forced to

(c)(3).) take legal action to invalidate the Council's action. (Gov. Code, § 54960, subds. (a) &

II. Cease and Desist: The Council Failed to Make Available to the Public Documents it Considered Before the Meeting on March 9, 2021.
The Council further violated the Brown Act by considering documents provided to it less than 72 hours prior to the meeting that were not made available to the public at the same time. (See Gov. Code, § 54957.5, subd. (b)(1); see also id., subd. (a).) These documents included a six-page memo to the City Manager amending the

NOE. (See Exhibit C.) recommendation by the Public Works Director to the Council to include adoption of the CASE #:56-2021-00554581-CU-WM-VTA RECEIPT

It is unclear whether the actual NOE was also provided to the Council prior to being filed with the County Clerk on or about March 15, 2021. The public was never provided with an opportunity to review the NOE.

III. Conclusion

Pursuant to Government Code sections 54960.1, subdivision (c)(2) and 54960.2,
$ subdivision (b), the City Council has thirty (30) days to address the violations of the Brown Act identified in this letter. If you do not take the necessary actions described 1H3: 3dAL 00 9Et : 7VIOI
ZE:80:0 above, G.I./WM will seek judicial invalidation of the Council's actions; judicial ã
determination of the applicability of the Brown Act to the Board's past violation of the Act; declaratory or injunctive relief; as well as recovery of its costs and reasonable

d attorneys' fees. (Gov. Code, $$ 54960, subd. (a), 54960.1, subd. (a), 54960.5.)
