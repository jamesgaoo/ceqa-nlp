7 OWNERS FOR SENSIBLE DEVELOPMENT ("Petitioner") alleges as follows:

8 I. INTRODUCTION

1. Disregarding the legitimate concerns expressed by the neighboring business owners, and

10 brushing aside their petitions for a new, site-specific EIR to be prepared, the City has approved a

11 massive new commercial office development project by engaging in the same type of conduct that

12 caused the Orange County Superior Court to issue writ of mandate against the City in 2008.

13 2. Relying on a clearly outdated EIR, just like it did it in 2008, the City has approved a

14 gargantuan office project in the Irvine Business Complex (the "IBC") by treating development rights as

15 if they were mere pieces on a checkerboard that could be freely transferred from one location to

16 another in the IBC without first analyzing the serious environmental consequences of doing so.

17 3. This is exactly the type of conduct that the a Court found was a violation of the California

18 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") in 2008. Inexplicably, the City has engaged in this conduct yet

19 again by allowing well over 221,000 square feet of development intensity values ("DIVs") to be

20 transferred all the way across town to the project site, even though the very EIR the City is relying on

21 to permit this transfer expressly assumed that no such transfers of development rights from one

22 Transportation Analysis Zone (*TAZ") to another would occur in the IBC prior to its buildout in 2030.
A.
23 The City Has Purposely Sought To Suppress The Public's Right To Fully Participate In The CEQA Review Process.

24 4. In addition to approving an unprecedented transfer of DIVs for the Project, the effects of

25 which have certainly never been analyzed in site-specific EIR, the City has employed an obvious ruse

26 to circumvent the requirements of CEQA so that the City (a) would not have to prepare and circulate

27 Subsequent EIR for public review and comment and (b) would not have to perform any analysis of the

28 reasonable project alternatives and feasible mitigation measures that could substantially lessen the

2
Petition For Writ of Mandate

t

1 significant adverse impacts of the project being developed by Real Party-in-Interest Gemdale 2400

2 Barranca Holdings, LLC ("Gemdale").

3 5. Gemdale is proposing to develop a huge 593,000 square-foot commercial office

4 complex, including a colossal seven-level parking structure with over 1,000 above-ground parking

5 spaces (the "Project") on an industrial park site located at 2400 Barranca Parkway which is far too

6 small to accommodate this mammoth development (the "Project Site").

7 6. However, instead of preparing a Subsequent EIR for the Project as expressly required by

8 CEQA section 21166 and sections 15162 and 15168 of the State CEQA Guidelines (the "Guidelines"),

9 the City has tried to "game the system" by purposely misrepresenting the true nature and scope of 1200

10 pages of new technical studies and reports relating to the Project and trying to pass them off as a minor

11 "Addendum" to the IBC Vision Plan and Mixed Use Overlay Zoning Code Program Environmental

12 Impact Report (the '2010 PEIR").

13 7. Unquestionably, the City has subverted all of CEQA's public disclosure policies and

14 requirements by intentionally withholding from public notice and circulation 1200 pages of detailed
15 environmental studies and reports relating to the Project's impacts on air quality, Greenhouse Gas,

16 noise, aesthetics, hydrology and water quality, public services, utilities and service systems, and

17 transportation.

18 8. The public should have been provided with the required statutory notice under CEQA

19 and a meaningful opportunity to review and comment on these substantial new materials before the

20 Project was approved by the Planning Commission, but the City flouted its obligations under CEQA in

21 determining that "no public review period [was] required" for the February 5, 2020 Addendum (the

22 "2020 Addendum"). (See, Notice of Determination (the "NOD"), filed by the City on July 17, 2020.)

23 9. Instead of trying to "bury" these voluminous materials in the 2020 Addendum that was

24 never circulated for public review and comment, the City should have made them part of a site-specific

25 Subsequent EIR for the Project because that would have ensured that they would have been published

26 in a Draft EIR that the public would have had ample time to comment on. In addition, if a Subsequent

27 EIR had been prepared as required by CEQA, the City would have been obligated to respond in writing

28 to any comments received from the public regarding the studies and reports in the Draft EIR.

3
Petition For Writ of Mandate

10. At the very least, if the City truly believed that the massive Project involved no

2 significant environmental effects that had not been adequately analyzed in the 2010 PEIR-a belief

3 which defies credulity--then the City should have publicly circulated an Initial Study and a proposed

4 Negative Declaration that the public would likewise have had the requisite time to submit written

5 comments on before the Project was approved by the Planning Commission. The City did neither, but

6 chose, instead, to treat the decade-old 2010 PEIR as the cornerstone CEQA document for the Project.

7 11. Of course, the 2010 PEIR did not analyze or address the Project in any way, shape, or

8 form. The City adopted the 2010 PEIR over 10 years ago for the express purpose of allowing up to

9 15,000 residential units to be developed in the IBC. Although the 2010 PEIR addressed a number of

10 specific residential projects that had been proposed for development as of 2010, it did not analyze the

11 impacts of any specific non-residential projects that might be developed in the IBC.

12 12. Nevertheless, without presenting any page references to the 2010 PEIR, and despite the

13 fact that Gemdale did not even submit its application for the Project until July 2019, nine years after the

14 2010 PEIR had been certified, City staff has made the wholly unsupported claims in their Staff Reports

15 to the Planning Commission and the City Council that all of the significant environmental effects,

16 mitigation measures, and project alternatives associated with Gemdale's Project had "already been
17 analyzed at a programmatic level" in the 2010 PEIR and that the Addendum had not identified any new

18 significant impacts that were not "previously addressed" in the 2010 PEIR.

19 13. On the basis of these blatantly untrue statements, City staff decided that the 2020

20 Addendum would not need to be circulated for public review and comment. That decision unlawfully

21 deprived the neighboring business owners and other members of the public of their statutory rights

22 under CEQA to (a) propose reasonable project alternatives and feasible mitigation measures that City

23 staff would otherwise have been required to analyze in a site-specific EIR and (b) submit written

24 comments on the site-specific impacts of the Project that staff would have been requited to respond to

25 as part of the EIR review process

26 14. After the Project was approved by the Planning Commission, and as a further attempt to

27 obstruct and suppress the public's ability to fully participate in the CEQA process, the City imposed

28 onerous and unconscionable appeal fees, totaling $17,000, on the member of Petitioner, Hale Holdings,

4
Petition For Writ of Mandate

T LLC ("Hale"), that sought to exercise its statutory right under CEQA section 21151(c) appeal the

2 Planning Commission's decision to the City Council. The City failed to answer Hale's many questions

3 and objections regarding the exorbitant appeal fees and threatened to cut off Hale's appeal rights if the

4 fees were not paid before the appeal hearing. Hale paid the appeal fees under protest, but when another

5 appellant, SAFER, failed to pay its excessive fees, the City refused to hear its appeal!

6 15. Showing utter indifference to the strenuous objections of the neighboring business

7 owners who are now members of Petitioner, the City proceeded to deny Hale's appeal and to approve

8 the Project on July 14, 2020, albeit on a sharply divided 3-2 vote of the City Council.

9 B. History Has Sadly Repeated Itself.

10 16. As noted above, in May 2008, in two consolidated CEQA mandamus actions brought by

11 Allergan, Inc., and the Cities of Newport Beach and Tustin, judgment was entered against the City and

12 a writ of mandate was issued directing the City to, among other things, stop approving transfers of
13 development rights ("TDRs) from "one area of the IBC to another" without an up-to-date EIR being in

14 place to "adequately analyze and disclose the environmental effects that could be caused by" such

15 transfers.

16 17. In addition, the Court found that the City had violated CEQA by impermissibly relying

17 on a "stale" EIR that had been prepared 16 years previously in 1992 and which, contrary to the City's

18 representations, did not anticipate or analyze the environmental effects of the specific project that was

19 the subject of the litigation. In this regard, the Court took the City to task for having "misrepresented

20 both the nature of the [environmental] document to the public and the nature of the environmental

21 analysis it was undertaking." The Court held that "this misrepresentation violated the spirit and the

22 letter of CEQA."

23 18. Regrettably, history has repeated itself because, in approving the Project, the City has

24 relied on the outdated 2010 PEIR which clearly did not address the site-specific impacts associated

25 with Gemdale's Project and most certainly did not analyze the impacts that will be caused by the

26 monstrous TDR that was approved for the Project. Indeed, the Gemdale's TDR turns out to be the
27 largest single transfer of development rights (221,014 square feet) in the history of the IBC. The real

28 travesty, however, is that the City approved this TDR without any EIR being in place to address the

5
Petition For Writ of Mandate

impacts of this historic TDR.

19. Moreover, just like in the 2008 case, the City has misrepresented the true nature of the
2020 Addendum by claiming that this massive compilation of new environmental analyses merely
represented "minor changes" to the 2010 PEIR when, in fact, the 2020 Addendum consisted of a 90-

5 page Initial Study and 1100 pages of new technical studies and reports providing new information

6 regarding new impacts and new mitigation measures that were never addressed in the 2010 PEIR. By

7 law, these extensive new "add-ons" to the 2010 PEIR should have been incorporated into a Subsequent

8 EIR and properly circulated for public review and comment.

20. However, in recommending that the Project be approved, City staff claimed in the

10 proceedings below that the 2010 PEIR had somehow peered 10 years into the future in specifically

11 foreseeing the development of Gemdale's Project, and had adequately "examined" and "analyzed" all

12 of the "potentially significant effects" of the Project many years before Gemdale even proposed it. The

13 NOD which the City caused to be filed and posted on July 17, 2020, actually put these outlandish

14 claims in writing.

15 21. Of course, nowhere in the entire 2010 PEIR is there any hint or suggestion that
16 Gemdale's immense Commercial Master Plan Project, or anything resembling it, was going be
17 developed at the Project Site. In fact, the 2010 PEIR expressly provided to the contrary.

18 C. The 2010 PEIR Anticipated That Only A Negligible Amount Of Additional Office Space

19 (13,000 SF) Would Be Developed In All Of TAZ No. 420.
22.
20 Appendix F, Land Use Methodology, of the 2010 PEIR indicated that no TDRs would

21 occur outside of the originating Transportation Analysis Zone ("TAZ") other than the TDRs already

22 approved by the City or the TDRs relating to the specific projects being analyzed in the 2010 PEIR. In

23 other words, the environmental analysis in the 2010 PEIR was entirely premised on the fact that no

24 development rights would be transferred between TAZs prior to the buildout of the IBC in 2030.

23.
25 In the proceedings below, the City had no choice but to openly concede this damaging
fact. The City was also forced to admit that the land use analysis in the 2010 PEIR was only done at 26
the TAZ level, as opposed to a site-specific level. (See Response 23, Response to Comments, 27

28 Attachment A to Attachment 5 to June 9 Staff Report.)

6
Petition For Writ of Mandate

1 24. These two admissions are fatal to the City's position because they completely

2 undermine the City's claims that the 2010 PEIR is adequate to serve as the primary CEQA document

3 for the Project. For example, in direct violation of the bedrock assumption underlying the 2010 PEIR

4 that the City would not allow any development rights or "DIVs" to be transferred between TAZs in

5 building out the IBC through 2030, Gemdale's Project involves the transfer of 221,014 square feet of

6 office equivalency DIVs from TAZ No. 544, located on the IBC's southern border, to TAZ No. 420,

7 located on the northern border of the IBC, where horrendous traffic conditions already exist along the

8 Barranca Parkway corridor.

9 25. More importantly, the 2010 PEIR assumed that only a negligible amount of office

10 development would occur in all of TAZ No. 420. Specifically, Appendix 10 of Appendix F of the 2010

11 PEIR shows that only an additional 13,000 square feet of office use was going to be developed in TAZ

12 No. 420 through the year 2030, when the IBC was presumed to be all built out. As such, the City's

13 approval of the TDR requested by Gemdale, transferring 221,014 square feet of office DIVs to the

14 Project Site, represents a 1600% increase in additional office square footage for TAZ No. 420 over

15 what was specifically projected in the 2010 PEIR.

16 26. Unquestionably, this huge increase in office square footage in TAZ No. 420 is entirely

17 at odds with what was forecast and analyzed in the 2010 PEIR, and it exposes the falsity of the City

18 Council's finding in its 7-14-20 Resolution approving the Project that "[t]he effects of project were

19 examined in the Program EIR." They clearly were not.

20 27. As further evidence that the Project is materially inconsistent with what was

21 contemplated in the 2010 PEIR, Appendix F of the 2010 PEIR identified the Project Site as "Project

22 65." and specifically designated that Site as "FIXED," meaning that the development projections for

23 the Site were not envisioned to change, even though the development estimates for other properties in

24 TAZ No. 420 were anticipated to change.

25 28. The specific projections in the 2010 PEIR for Project 65 (i.e., the Project Site) that were

26 intended to remain "FIXED" through 2030 were as follows: 32,862 square feet of existing
27 manufacturing use and 44,010 square feet of existing and potential office use, for a total of

28 approximately 77,000 square feet of development use at the Project Site. However, adding two multi-

7
Petition For Writ of Mandate

1 story office buildings comprising 275,000 square feet and a seven-level parking structure comprising

2 318,000 square feet, for a total of 593.000 square feet of development uses at the Project Site, is a

3 radical-indeed, startling change to what was supposed to remain a "FIXED" site as stated in the

4 2010 PEIR.

5 29. To put this into proper perspective, the Project represents a nearly 700% increase in the

6 total development square footage that was slated for the Project Site in the 2010 PEIR (77,000 SF vs.

7 593,000 SF) and a 525% increase in the office use that was projected for the Site (44,010 SF vs.

8 275,000 SF).

9 30. When viewed in light of these shocking increases in square footage over what was

10 explicitly projected in the 2010 PEIR, it becomes quite obvious that the site-specific impacts, project

11 alternatives, and mitigation measures associated with the Project were never analyzed, nor were they

12 even contemplated, in the 2010 PEIR. That makes the City's refusal to prepare a site-specific EIR for

13 Gemdale's huge Project all the more indefensible and unlawful.

14 31. Unfortunately, as the Project was being processed for approval, the City turned deaf

15 ear to the chorus of requests it received from the surrounding business owners, imploring the City to

16 prepare Subsequent EIR for the Project. Likewise, the City turned a blind eye to the explicit

17 provisions of CEQA and the Guidelines that required the City to prepare a Subsequent EIR for the

18 Project.

19 D. The City Has Flagrantly Violated The Provisions Of CEQA And The Guidelines
Requiring The Preparation Of A Subsequent EIR For The Project.
20 32. CEQA section 21166 and Guidelines sections 15162 and 15168 specify the conditions
21 that, if met, will require the preparation of a Subsequent EIR for a later project, even though a Program
22 EIR has been adopted. The determination as to whether a Subsequent EIR should be prepared for a
23 given project is to be made "on the basis of substantial evidence in light of the whole record", which
24 would include the evidence submitted by Petitioner and other members of the public in the
25 administrative proceedings below.
26 33. As explained in greater detail below, the evidence is overwhelming that the Project
27 satisfied at least seven (7) different conditions that would have specifically required a Subsequent EIR
28 to have been prepared for the Project. In the face of these explicit requirements, the City adamantly
8
Petition For Writ of Mandate

1 refused to prepare a Subsequent EIR, claiming that the 2020 Addendum was all that was needed, even

2 though Guideline section 15164 only allows an addendum to be used if "none of the conditions

3 described in section 15162 calling for the preparation of a subsequent EIR have occurred". (Emphasis

4 added.)

5 34. In this case, the following seven conditions requiring a Subsequent EIR clearly and

6 unmistakably "occurred" with respect to the Project:

7 34.1 Guidelines Section 15162(a)(3)(A): The Project Will Have One Or More Significant

8 Effects Not Discussed In The Previous EIR.

34.1.1.
9 This rule is simple and straightforward: if a later project will have even

10 one significant effect that was not discussed in the previous EIR, then a Subsequent EIR must be

11 prepared. There are no exceptions or qualifications: if a project will cause one or more significant

12 environmental impacts that were not addressed in the previous EIR, then the above-stated condition in

13 Guidelines section 15162(a)(3)(A) is satisfied and the public agency must prepare a Subsequent EIR

14 before approving the project.

15 34.1.2. As explained below in section III.H of this Petition, Gemdale's Project

16 will generate numerous significant environmental effects that were clearly not discussed in the 2010

17 PEIR because that EIR was only prepared at the "programmatic" level, not at the site-specific level

18 required to properly analyze the impacts of the Project. These additional impacts cry out for the

19 preparation of a Subsequent EIR. In particular, there is one major impact that the Project will have on

20 transportation that could not possibly have been addressed in the 2010 PEIR because CEQA did not

21 require it to be separately analyzed until 2018, and this requirement did not take effect as a part of the

22 Guidelines until 2020.

23 34.1.3. Indeed, what is conspicuously absent from the 2010 PEIR and the 2020

24 Addendum is an analysis of the Project's transportation impacts in terms of vehicle miles travelled

25 ("VMT"). In recent years, a sea change has occurred in CEQA with respect to analyzing a project's

26 impacts on transportation. As of July 1, 2020, CEQA section 21099 and Guidelines section 15064.3

27 made an analysis of VMT mandatory for all development projects being processed for approval in

28 California. Blithely ignoring the written requests it received from Hale asking for a VMT analysis to

0
Petition For Writ of Mandate

be performed for the Project, the City approved the Project without complying with CEQA Guidelines

2 section 15064.3(b). The lengthy Traffic Impact Analysis ("TIA") that the City placed great reliance on
in approving the Project did not provide any analysis of the VMT associated with the Project, nor did it
address any VMT mitigation.

34.1.4. Since the 2010 PEIR was devoid of the required VMT analysis for the

6 Project, the Project's impacts on VMT obviously constitute a "significant effect not discussed in the

7 previous EIR," thus requiring the preparation of a Subsequent EIR for the Project. The VMT Impact

8 Analysis Guidelines published by the California Governor's Office of Planning and Research, dated
December 28, 2018 ("OPR Technical Advisory"), recommend a threshold of significance for requiring

10 a VMT analysis to be performed if a given project would generate more than 110 average daily trips

11 ("ADT"). The Project will generate a staggering 2,677.90 ADT, thus putting the Project way over the

12 statewide threshold and clearly establishing that the Project's VMT-related transportation impacts will

13 constitute "significant" environmental effects that must be addressed in a Subsequent EIR.

14 34.1.5. Irrefutably, the Project will increase VMT in the City of Irvine, yet the

15 City has completely shirked its obligation under Guidelines section 15064.3 to analyze the

16 environmental impacts of this increase. According to the Resolution the City Council adopted on July

17 14, 2020, the Council "approved" the Project on that date, and this was expressly confirmed in the

18 NOD filed on July 17, 2020. Section 15002 of the Guidelines addresses the "Time for Compliance"

19 with the Guidelines and provides that a governmental agency must comply with all CEQA procedures

20 in effect when the agency proposes to "approve" the activity in question. In addition, section 15007(b)

21 of the Guidelines provides that "New requirements in amendments will apply to steps in the CEQA

22 process not yet undertaken by the date when agencies must comply with the amendments."

23 34.1.6. The final "approval" step in the CEQA process for the Project had not yet

24 been undertaken by the City's elected decision-making body (see CEQA section 21151(c)) when

25 Guidelines section 15064.3 became effective on July 1, 2020. Accordingly, the City was statutorily

26 required to perform a VMT impact analysis for the Project in a Subsequent EIR. However, even

27 though Hale repeatedly asked the City to perform that analysis, it brazenly refused to do so.

34.2 Guidelines Section 15168(c)(1): If A Later Activity Would Have Effects That Were 3 Not Examined In The Program EIR, A New Initial Study Would Need To Be Prepared

4 Leading To Either An EIR Or A Negative Declaration.

34.2.1.
5 Section 15168(c)(1) sets forth a very simple test-i.e., if a later project

6 would have any environmental "effects" that were "not examined" in the program EIR, then a new

7 initial study would need to be prepared, leading to the preparation of either (1) a Subsequent EIR if any

8 of the conditions described in section 15162 were found to occur or (2) a Negative Declaration. As

9 shown above, the VMT-related impacts of the Project were not examined in the 2010 PEIR and they

10 will exceed the threshold of significance established by the OPR Technical Advisory by some 20 times

11 over. However, the Initial Study set forth in the 2020 Addendum makes no mention of the Project's

12 impacts on VMT. Likewise, as explained below, there are numerous other significant environmental

13 impacts that will be generated by the Project, but which were not examined in the 2010 PEIR.

14 Accordingly, the City violated Guidelines section 15168(c)(1), as well as various subdivisions of

15 section 15162, in failing to prepare a Subsequent EIR for the Project.

16 34.3 Guidelines Section 15162(a)(3)(D): Project Alternatives Which Are Considerably
17 Different From Those Analyzed In The Previous EIR Would Substantially Reduce One Or More Significant Effects On The Environment, But The Project Proponents Decline
18 To Adopt The Alternatives.

19 34.3.1. As explained below, Hale devoted a great deal of time and effort to
20 developing a reduced-density alternative to the Project that would have greatly lessened the significant

21 adverse impacts of the Project. Also, the City's Mayor, Christina Shea, proposed another project

22 alternative that would have reduced the Project's significant effects. Unfortunately, Gemdale flatly

23 rejected these project alternatives and stubbornly refused to consider any alternatives that reduced the

24 square footage of the Project.

25 34.3.2. Accordingly, since these alternatives were not analyzed in the 2010

26 PEIR, and because Gemdale declined to adopt them, the above-stated condition in Guidelines section

27 15162(a)(3)(D) was clearly satisfied and the City was required to, but did not, prepare a Subsequent

28 EIR for the Project to analyze these alternatives and others.

34.4 Guidelines Section 15162(a)(3)(D): Mitigation Measures Which Are Considerably

2 Different From Those Analyzed In The Previous EIR Would Substantially Reduce One
Or More Significant Effects On The Environment, But The Project Proponents Decline

3 To Adopt The Mitigation Measures.

34.4.1. As explained below in section III.H, members of the public, including

5 members of Petitioners, proposed various mitigation measures, such as installing a traffic signal at

6 Millikan, imposing ingress/egress restrictions to control vehicular access to Hale and Gates Streets, and

7 implementing parking restrictions on Hale and Gates. These mitigation measures would reduce the

8 horrific traffic impacts that will occur when literally hundreds of vehicles try to enter or exit the Project

9 Site throughout the day and during peak hours. Gemdale declined to adopt those mitigation measures

10 when the Project was approved and the City made no effort to impose these mitigation measures on the

11 Project. As noted in the NOD, "mitigation measures were not made a condition of approval of the

12 Project."

13 34.4.2. Accordingly, because these mitigation measures were rejected by

14 Gemdale and not made a part of the Project, the above-stated condition in Guidelines section

15 15162(a)(3)(D) was clearly satisfied and the City was required to, but did not, prepare a Subsequent

16 EIR of the Project to analyze these and other mitigation measures.

17
34.5 Guidelines Section 15162(a)(3(B): Significant Effects Previously Examined Will Be
18 Substantially More Severe Than Shown In The Previous EIR.

19 34.5.1. Quite logically, since the site-specific effects of the Project were not

20 known and could not have been examined in the 2010 PEIR- or, at best, could only have been

21 analyzed at a general "programmatic" level-then the Project's site-specific impacts will, by necessity,

22 be "substantially more severe" than what was "shown" in the 2010 PEIR. Indeed, nothing about the

23 Project was shown in the 2010 PEIR.

24 34.5.2. Accordingly, the above-stated condition in Guidelines section

25 15162(a)(3)(B) was clearly satisfied and the City was required to, but failed to, prepare a Subsequent

26 EIR for the Project to analyze its site-specific impacts.

1 34.6 Guideline Section 15162(a)(1): Substantial Changes Are Proposed In The Project
Which Will Require Major Revisions Of The Previous EIR Due To The Involvement Of

2 New Significant Environmental Effects Or A Substantial Increase In The Severity Of
Previously Identified Significant Effects.

3 34.6.1. As noted above, the Project represents a "substantial"-in fact, a

4 radical-change to "Project 65" that the 2010 PEIR anticipated would be developed at the Project Site.

5 To say the least, the Project has already required "major revisions" to the 2010 PEIR in the form of

6 1200 pages of new technical studies and reports, which the City has tried to pass off as a mere

7 "Addendum." As explained below in section III.H, even more revisions will be necessary to address

8 the numerous "new significant environmental effects" that will be generated by the Project.
9 34.6.2. Accordingly, the above-stated condition in Guidelines section

10 15162(a)(1) was satisfied and the City was required to, but did not, prepare a Subsequent EIR for the
11 Project.

12 34.7 Guideline Section 15162(a)(2): Substantial Changes Occur With Respect To The
Circumstances Under Which The Project Is Undertaken Which Will Require Major
13 Revisions Of The Previous EIR Due To The Involvement Of New Significant

14 Environmental Effects Or A Substantial Increase In The Severity Of Previously
Identified Significant Effects.

15 34.7.1. As noted above, the 2010 PEIR was premised on the assumption that

16 there would be no transfers of DIVs between TAZs. However, the TDR that was approved for the

17 Project involves a huge transfer of office equivalency DIVs from TAZ No. 544 to TAZ No. 420.
18 Unquestionably, this represents a "substantial change" with respect to "the circumstances under which
19 is the Project is undertaken." This change has already necessitated major revisions to the 2010 PEIR in

20 the form of 1200 pages of new technical studies and reports relating to the Project. As explained

21 below, even more revisions will be necessary to address the numerous significant impacts that will be

22 generated by the Project.

23 34.7.2. Accordingly, the above-stated condition in Guidelines section

24 15162(a)(2) was clearly satisfied and the City was required to, but failed to, prepare a Subsequent EIR

25 for the Project.

26 35. As summarized above, and as set forth in greater detail in section III.H below, the City
27 has violated CEQA and the Guidelines in numerous respects in approving Gemdale's Project. As such,
28 Petitioner respectfully submits that a writ of mandate should be issued directing the City Council to

13
Petition For Writ of Mandate

rescind and invalidate all approvals relating to the Project.

2 Il. THE PARTIES

2 III. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

3 The Irvine Business Complex And The 2010 PEIR.

4 43. The Irvine Business Complex or IBC is a 2,800-acre area in the City of Irvine, that is

5 zoned for mixed commercial, industrial, and residential uses. The area is generally bounded by the

6 former Tustin Marine Corps Air Station to the north, the San Diego Creek channel to the east, John

7 Wayne Airport and Campus Drive to the south and State Route 55 to the west.

8 44. In 2010, the City desired to shift the balance of future development towards additional

9 residential uses. Accordingly, the City approved the IBC Vision Plan and Mixed Use Overlay Zoning

10 Code (the "IBC Vision Plan"), which increased the total number of residential units authorized for the

11 IBC from 9,455 units to 17,038 units, while offsetting that increase by reducing the total square footage

12 of authorized nonresidential development from 53,125,389 square feet of office equivalency to

13 48,787,662 square feet of office equivalency.

14 45. The 2010 PEIR was certified by the County to serve as the environmental

15 documentation for the IBC Vision Plan. Not only was it prepared as a "program EIR" under

16 Guidelines section 15168 for the IBC Vision Plan as a whole, but it was also prepared as a "project

17 EIR" under Guidelines section 15161 for seven specific residential development projects that were

18 under consideration at the same time as the larger IBC Vision Plan.

19 46. The 2010 PEIR recognized that, when program EIR is relied on in the evaluation of a

20 subsequent development project, the lead agency must incorporate feasible mitigation measures and

21 alternatives developed in the program EIR into the subsequent activities. (Guidelines section

22 15168(c)(3)). In addition, the 2010 PEIR acknowledged that, if a subsequent activity would have

23 effects not within the scope of the program EIR, the lead agency must prepare a new Initial Study

24 leading to a Negative Declaration, Mitigated Negative Declaration, or an EIR. (2010 PEIR Executive

25 Summary, at 1-4.)

26 B. Gemdale's Development Application And The 2020 Addendum.

27 47. Gemdale's Project at 2400 Barranca Parkway is located in an industrial park in the
28 northeastern portion of the IBC. The industrial park is an area comprised predominantly of one-story

15
Petition For Writ of Mandate

1 manufacturing buildings on 65 small lots, at least 50 of which are occupied by small businesses.

2 48. Due to the unique circulation system in the industrial park, the area has some of the

3 worst traffic congestion in the City.

4 49. On July 1, 2019, Gemdale submitted its Master Plan Application (*MPA"), which

5 sought to (i) demolish the existing building at the Project Site (approximately 70,000 square feet), (ii)

6 construct two new office buildings (approximately 275,000 square feet), and (iii) construct a 317,812

7 square-foot seven-level, above-ground parking structure - all on a 4.95-acre lot.

8 50. Under the IBC Vision Plan, the property did not have enough authorized office space
equivalency to allow this level of development intensity to occur in such small area. Indeed, the

10 nearly 600,000 square-foot Project would result in an almost 700% increase in the amount of square

11 footage (77,000 square feet) that the 2010 PEIR anticipated would be developed at the Project site.

12 51. Accordingly, Gemdale sought to transfer the authorized office equivalency from another

13 project (Project No. 723 located at 7040 Scholarship) to the Project Site. Project No. 723 had been

14 developed as part of a residential project, and thus had unused authorized office space equivalency that

15 could theoretically be transferred to other areas of the IBC. However, similar transfers in the past had

16 involved much smaller transfers-Gemdale's Project would require the single largest transfer of floor

17 area ratio ("FAR") and DIVs (221,014 square feet) in the history of the IBC. These other transfers thus

18 did not result in traffic and other impacts anywhere near as severe as those that will be created by

19 Gemdale's Project.

20 C. Preparation And Approval Of The 2020 Addendum.

21 52. Despite the obvious environmental impacts that would be created by transferring so

22 much office space intensity to an already congested area, the City did not require the preparation of a

23 Subsequent EIR, or even a Supplemental EIR. Instead, the City merely required the preparation of an

24 Addendum.

25 53. This was clearly improper, because the 2010 PEIR provides no information whatsoever

26 regarding any of the site-specific environmental impacts, mitigation measures, or project alternatives

27 relating to the Project. Instead, the 2010 PEIR only provides site-specific analysis and review of seven

28 residential development projects that were pending ten years ago when the 2010 PEIR was approved

16
Petition For Writ of Mandate

1 and certified.

7 54. The addendum process was also improper because the Project is materially inconsistent

3 with the IBC Vision Plan land use model set forth in Appendix F of the 2010 PEIR. That model not

4 only assumed that there would be no transfers of DIVs to other TAZs in the IBC, but also expressly

5 assumed and geographically depicted the fact that the development intensity at the Project Site would

6 remain FIXED at 77,000 square feet of existing and potential development, and that there would

7 literally be zero redevelopment taking place at the Project site through the post-2030 buildout of the

8 IBC Vision Plan. Moreover, the Project does not meet any of the stated objectives of the IBC Vision

9 Plan which are set forth in the 2010 PEIR.

10 55. Nevertheless, City staff, in conjunction with third-party consultant First Carbon

11 Solutions ("FCS"), prepared the 1,200-page 2020 Addendum, in January 2020.

12 56. On February 18, 2020, the Transportation Commission held public meeting on the

13 Project's Transportation Impact Analysis ("TIA"). After public comments were addressed by Gemdale

14 representatives present at the meeting, the Transportation Commission voted unanimously, with all
15 Commissioners present, to recommend the Planning Commission's approval of the TIA prepared for

16 the Project.

17 57. On March 4, 2020, Hale submitted its letter of objections regarding the Gemdale

18 Project.

19 58. On March 5, 2020, the City's Planning Commission voted to approve the Project and

20 the 2020 Addendum. Prior to formalizing the approval, the Planning Commission published its Staff

21 Report, to which the 2020 Addendum was first made public as an attachment. No drafts of the 2020

22 Addendum were circulated to the public for review or comment prior to the publication of the final

23 version as an attachment to the March 5, 2020 Planning Commission Staff Report.

24 D. Hale's Proposed Alternative.

25 59. Hale has twice attempted to propose alternatives to the Project that would address many

26 of the issues referenced in this Petition. A visual comparison of the Project and Hale's proposed

27 project alternative appears below:

28

17
Petition For Writ of Mandate

-
a Un A 0

7 Gemdale's Proposed Project

8 60. Hale's Proposed Project Alternative

9 Hale's proposed alternative would allow for the construction of up to 170,000 square

10 feet of office development on the 4.95-square foot Project site. The office space would be distributed

11 between two office buildings up to four stories in height that would be oriented towards Barranca

12 Parkway to give the greatest visibility from the major street.

61.

13 The revised parking structure would be divided between the three-level above-ground

14 parking structure and a surface parking lot, which together would accommodate up to 680 parking

15 spaces. The parking structure, which would also be oriented towards Barranca Parkway, would

16 provide up to 464 parking spaces that would enter and exit only via Barranca Parkway. The surface

17 parking lot, consisting of up to 216 parking spaces, would allow ingress and egress only via Hale and

18 Gates streets. That parking lot would provide boundary landscaping and parking areas to establish a

19 visual buffer between the Project and the adjacent properties. The two restricted access points would

20 ensure that the traffic generated by the Project would be distributed in a manner that would protect the

21 Hale/Gates business owners from conflicts and congestion from the Project.

62.

22 In the Transportation Commission meeting held on February 18, 2020, and the Planning

23 Commission meeting held on March 5, 2020, certain City commissioners stated their firm beliefs that

24 vehicles exiting onto Barranca from the Project during peak hours would pose no traffic queuing or

25 congestion problems on that thoroughfare, thereby confirming that directing all vehicles exiting the

26 three-level parking structure onto Barranca would be feasible.

63. Hale's proposed alternative project would substantially reduce the vehicle trips and
27 VMT-related impacts generated by the Project, which will lead to a corresponding substantial reduction

28 in the Project's environmental effects on air quality and GHG emissions. The reduction in vehicle trips

18
Petition For Writ of Mandate

1 associated with Hale's project alternative will substantially lessen the Project's impacts on traffic

2 circulation at the Gates/Millikan intersection and the Project's overall impacts to traffic in the IBC.

3 The reduction in the unmitigated VMT associated with the Project will substantially lessen the

4 Project's transportation impacts to the city and region.

5 64. Hale's project alternative would also continue to provide a financially viable project for

6 Gemdale that would result in up to a .79 FAR of office development with an associated TDR of

7 115,652 square feet (.54 FAR).

8 65. Hale also proposed other feasible traffic mitigation measures, which Gemdale

9 subsequently rejected, including the installation of a traffic signal at Gates and Millikan.

10 E. The Appeals To The City Council.

11 66. On March 17, 2020, Richard Drury of Drury, Lozeau Drury LLP filed a Request for

12 Appeal of the City's initial approval of the Project on behalf of Supporters Alliance For Environmental

13 Responsibility ("SAFER"). On March 20, 2020, Peter Swartz followed suit and filed a Request for

14 Appeal on behalf of Hale. These two appeals (the "Appeals") were initially required by law to be held

15 within 60 days, but, on March 27, 2020, the City, Gemdale, SAFER, and Hale all agreed to continue

16 the hearing on the Appeals to May 26, 2020, on the condition that the hearings would not be pushed out

17 any farther unless all parties agreed.

18 67. On Friday May 15, 2020, City Council disclosed that City staff had inexplicably failed

19 to provide proper public notice for the May 26, 2020 hearing, and would be recommending that the

20 meeting be continued to June 9. 2020 in order to provide the proper notice. Hale objected to this

21 unlawful and unilateral delay, but the City Council proceeded to continue the hearing to June 9.

22 68. On June 8, 2020, Hale submitted a letter and corresponding appendix explaining the

23 bases for its objections to the Planning Commission's initial approval of the Project.

24 69. Prior to the June 9. 2020 hearing on the Appeals, the City's staff issued a June 9, 2020

25 Staff Report recommending that the City Council deny the Appeals and approve the Project. At the

26 June gth hearing, the City Council instead chose to again continue the public hearing on July 14, 2020,

27 at Gemdale and Hale's requests, because both parties wanted an opportunity to privately discuss project

28 alternatives.

19
Petition For Writ of Mandate

70. On July 14, 2020, prior to the hearing on the Appeal, Hale submitted its Supplemental

2 Letter of objections regarding the Planning Commission's approval of the Project, along with a
corresponding appendix, which included detailed information and renderings of Hale's proposed
project alternative.

5 F. The City's Demand For Unreasonable Appeal Fees.

71. After Hale filed its appeal of the Project and agreed to the City's request to postpone the

7 appeal hearing to May 26, 2020, the City and its outside counsel notified counsel for Hale and SAFER

8 that they would have to agree to cover all of the City's costs related to the appeal and review of the
Project before the City Council would consider the Appeals. The City claimed that City Council

10 Resolution No. 19-33 ("Resolution 19-33") gave them the legal right to seek their costs from the

11 appellants, as opposed to the Project's applicant Gemdale - despite the fact that Resolution 19-33

12 expressly states that the applicant (i.e., Gemdale) would be responsible for bearing these costs.

13 72. City Counsel failed and refused to answer basic questions about these fees and the

14 City's justification for charging them, and would not provide an estimate of the total amount of fees

15 that would be charged to Hale. Instead, City Counsel responded to Hale's questions with threats that if

16 Hale did not pay the fee, then Hale's appeal would be dismissed without hearing. The same demand

17 for fees and threat of dismissal was made to SAFER.

18 73. In response to Public Records Act requests concerning these fees, Hale learned that the

19 City actually intended to charge Hale it for time spent to oppose Hale's appeal. Indeed, the billing
20 records of City staff indicated that staff worked closely with Gemdale to prepare its response to the

21 Appeals. Throughout the preparation of that response, the billing records show that staff conducted

22 several teleconferences with Gemdale, and even allowed Gemdale and it's attorneys to review and edit

23 the City's response before it was submitted to the City Council. Of course, no such courtesy was

24 afforded to Hale, and City staff did not hold any teleconferences with Hale about the merits of its

25 Appeal.

26 74. Even more egregiously, the public records showed that the City also intended to bill

27 Hale for time spent by a consultant specifically hired by the City to prepare "thorough and legally

28 defensible responses to each of the comment letters." (Emphasis added.)

20
Petition For Writ of Mandate

I 75. On May 22, 2020, the City sent Hale an invoice for $16,885.50 for time spent by City

2 staff in connection with Hale's Appeal, and sent a similar invoice to SAFER. The City stated that there

3 would be further invoices that the appellants would be responsible for paying, and again refused to

4 provide any estimate of the total costs that the appellants would be responsible for paying.

5 76. Hale only agreed to pay the City's $16,885.50 invoice under duress, because the City

6 expressly refused to guarantee that Hale could exercise its statutory right to appeal unless Hale paid the

7 exorbitant fees. Accordingly, Hale paid the fees under protest, and objected for, among other reasons,

8 the fact that Hale was being charged fees in connection with work by City staff that conferred no
9 "benefit" of any kind to anyone besides the applicant itself (i.e., Gemdale).

10 77. SAFER, on the other hand, refused to pay the improper fees imposed by the City in

11 connection with its appeal. As a result, when SAFER's representatives appeared to make statements in

12 support of SAFER's appeal at the July 14, 2020 City Council hearing, the City Council voted to

13 deprive SAFER's right to (i) make a statement on the record, and (ii) appeal the City's initial approval

14 of the Project.

15 G. The City Council's Approval Of The Project.

16 78. Prior to the June 9, 2020 City Council meeting, City staff released the City's Staff

17 Report. The Staff Report expressly stated that appeals are subject to a de novo standard of review - "as

18 f [the Project] is being considered for the first time."

19 79. On July 14, 2020, the City Council held the public hearing on the Appeals. During the

20 public hearing, the members of the City Council attempted to persuade Gemdale and Hale's

21 representatives to reach a compromise regarding : project alternative. Despite their efforts, Gemdale's

22 representative repeatedly refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of Hale's proposals, and rejected:

23 possible compromise, based on (i) the amount Gemdale had already expended in architectural fees, and

24 (ii) the fact that Hale's alternative proposals all reduced the overall square footage of the Project.

25 80. Prior to the final vote, the Mayor Christina Shea stated that the Project as planned is

26 "much too dense," and further stated that the notion that the Project would not lead to increased traffic

27 in the area was "clearly ridiculous." Before voting not to approve the Project, Mayor Shea further

28 stated that "I can't imagine anyone even believes that when you add 275,000 square feet of density,

21
Petition For Writ of Mandate

that you're not going to have a traffic issue." Council member Fox echoed that sentiment. The three

2 other members of the City Council, however, voted to deny Hale's appeal and approve the Project.

81. On July 17, 2020, the County posted the NOD for the Project. The NOD expressly

4 stated, in part, as follows: "This is to advise that the City Council of Irvine has denied the appeal of

5 the project, thereby approving the above-described [Project] on July 14, 2020."

6 82. After the City Council approved the Project, and prior to the filing of this Action,
Petitioner, a California non-profit association, was formed to prosecute this Action pursuant to Public

8 Resources Code section 21177(c).

9 H. The City's Violations of CEQA.

10 83. In approving the Project, the City violated CEQA and the Guidelines in the following

11 respects, and for the reasons previously discussed above:

12 1. The 2010 PEIR Is Materially Outdated And Cannot Be Used As The CEQA
13 Compliance Documentation For The Project Because, Among Other Things, A Cornerstone Assumption On Which The Entire Environmental
14 Analysis In The 2010 PEIR Was Based Is No Longer Valid With Respect To The Maximum Amount Of Buildout Potential For Nonresidential Office
15 Equivalency Square Footage Remaining In The IBC.

16 84. The environmental analysis in the 2010 PEIR was based on the premise that, in order to

17 allow 15,000 dwelling units to be built in the IBC, there was going to be an offsetting reduction of

18 4,337,727 square feet of nonresidential office equivalency, such that the remaining unused

19 nonresidential intensity allowed for the IBC under the City's General Plan would be 6,016,662 square

20 feet of office equivalency.

21 85. Over the past ten years since the 2010 PEIR was certified, all 15,000 residential units

22 allowed under the IBC Vision Plan have been approved for construction and most have already been

23 built. However, although all 15,000 dwelling units envisioned by the 2010 PEIR have already been

24 developed or entitled for development, the remaining buildout potential of nonresidential square

25 footage in the IBC has increased without any environmental analysis, thus rendering invalid one of the

26 major land use assumptions underlying the 2010 PEIR.

27 86. As set forth in Table 3.5 in the 2015 Update to the IBC Vision Plan Traffic Fee Nexus

28 Study, the amount of "office remaining development" (2015 to 2030) to be built in the IBC was stated

22
Petition For Writ of Mandate

1 to be 7,647,000 square feet, representing an increase of approximately 1.6 million square feet of

2 nonresidential development potential over and above what was assumed and analyzed in the 2010

3 PEIR.

4 87. At the Irvine Transportation Commission meeting held on February 18, 2020, a

5 representative of Gemdale and a memb of the Commission stated in reference to the Project that the

6 amount of nonresidential development potential remaining in the IBC is approximately 7.4 million

7 square feet. This figure was not disputed or corrected by City Traffic Engineer Bourgeois who was

8 presiding over the meeting.

9 88. In light of the foregoing information, there has been a significant increase of

10 approximately 1.4 to 1.6 million square feet of remaining development potential in the IBC that was

11 never analyzed in the 2010 PEIR. Such substantial increase in nonresidential development potential,

12 over and above the amount that was studied and addressed in the 2010 PEIR, represents a material

13 change in the IBC Vision Plan and demonstrates that the 2010 PEIR is not adequate to serve as the

14 CEQA compliance documentation for the Project.

15 89. As a result of this deficiency, and it before it can be used for any further projects in the

16 IBC, the 2010 PEIR needs to be materially updated by means of another EIR that will fully analyze the

17 significant environmental effects, feasible mitigation measures, and reasonable project alternatives

18 associated with all of this additional nonresidential square footage in the IBC.

19 90. Specifically, the 2010 PEIR needs to be revised to analyze the large increase in
20 nonresidential square footage in the IBC to determine (a) whether the implementation of the IBC

21 Vision Plan will result in more severe environmental effects involving the entire range of impacts (e.g.,

22 transportation, air quality, aesthetics, noise, land use compatibility, etc.) that were addressed in the

23 2010 PEIR and (b) whether such impacts will require new and more extensive mitigation through

24 additional PPP's, PDF's and mitigation measures. Since the adoption of the 2010 PEIR, new mitigation

25 measures may now be feasible to lessen the environmental effects of the Project's operations.

26 91. Until the 2010 PEIR is revised and updated as described above, it will remain deficient

27 and, as such, cannot be relied upon to adequately address the environmental effects associated with the

28 Project or any other project in the IBC.

2. The 2020 Addendum Cannot Properly Serve As The CEQA Compliance Documentation For The Project.

2 92. In addition to preparing the lengthy 90-page Initial Study for the Project, the City also

3 prepared 11 different appendices consisting of 1,098 pages of technical studies, reports, analyses, and

4 plans relating to the Project, and then made the fateful admission in the 2020 Addendum that "the

5 proposed project could have a significant effect on the environment.»

6 93. Notwithstanding this finding, the City improperly concluded in the 2020 Addendum that

7 (a) "nothing further" was required in terms of CEQA compliance, and (b) it was permissible to prepare

8 an Addendum to the 2010 PEIR, a rather than a Subsequent or Supplemental EIR, because all potentially

9 significant effects of the Project had been "analyzed adequately" in the 2010 PEIR. As noted above,

10 the 2010 PEIR did not analyze any of the environmental impacts, mitigation measures, or project

11 alternatives associated with the Project; to the contrary, it excluded them from review and assumed that

12 the Project Site would not be redeveloped.

13 94. The 1200-page 2020 Addendum cannot properly be characterized as consisting of "only

14 minor additions or changes" that were necessary to make the 2010 PEIR apply to the Project. Rather,

15 the 1100 pages of technical studies, reports, plans, and analyses included as part of the 2020 Addendum

16 constitute "major revisions" to the 2010 PEIR, within the meaning of CEQA section 21166 and CEQA

17 Guidelines section 15162. This extensive technical documentation raises important new issues

18 regarding the significant environmental effects of the Project, thereby precluding the use of an

19 Addendum, instead of a Subsequent EIR.

20 95. The project description in the 2020 Addendum is seriously deficient in that it fails to

21 provide sufficient information for the public to confirm the correct land uses, square footages, setbacks,

22 distances between the Project and existing buildings, and the Project setting. For example, although the

23 2010 PEIR indicated that the square footage of the existing building at the Project Site was 55,034

24 square feet, the 2020 Addendum has inexplicably inflated the size of the existing building to 69,780

25 square feet.

26 96. The building square footage figure stated in the 2020 Addendum is at odds with the

27 2015 Certificate of Occupancy for the existing building which stated that the existing building had a

28 square footage of 59,513 square feet. In addition, the square footage stated in the 2020 Addendum

24
Petition For Writ of Mandate

I greatly conflicts with the square footage of the existing building stated in the 2020 Project Plans-i.e.,

2 44,867 square feet.

3 97. The square footage of the existing building that is used in the 2020 Addendum has

4 significantly increased from the amount of square footage stated in the 2010 PEIR. This has materially

5 skewed the CEQA analysis in that the unexplained 27% increase in square footage allows for an

6 underpayment of IBC Traffic Mitigation Fees which are designed to mitigate the significant

7 transportation impacts associated with the Project.

8 98. Page 67 of the 2020 Addendum indicates that the City has improperly invoked a Class

9 32 "in fill project" exemption in order to avoid having to fully and properly analyze the Project's

10 greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions and to likewise avoid having to comply with SCAQMD's GHG

11 regulations. Without formally declaring that it was invoking a Class 32 exemption and having the

12 Planning Commission make findings to that effect, the City has nevertheless improperly excused itself

13 from fully and properly analyzing the Project's GHG emissions on the grounds that the Project is

14 exempt from scrutiny under CEQA.

15 99. The current CEQA Guidelines were adopted in December 2018 with an effective date of

16 December 28, 2018. Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines §15007(d), public agencies were required to

17 comply with the new provisions in the Guidelines beginning 120 days after the effective date of the

18 Guideline amendments, which, in this case, was April 27, 2019. However, it appears that the it
19 Environmental Checklist used for the Addendum was the previous Environmental Checklist adopted in

20 2014. The City's failure to use the correct Checklist has resulted in an incomplete analysis of the

21 environmental impacts associated with the Project, including, but not limited to, its energy impacts.

22 100. On page 2 of the 2020 Addendum, after quoting verbatim from the provisions of CEQA

23 Guidelines section 15162 that would otherwise have required the preparation of a Subsequent EIR for

24 the Project, the City has made the unsupported, conclusory statement that "none of the circumstances

25 described in CEQA Guidelines Section 15162 are present." Contrary to the requirements of

26 subdivision (e) of CEQA Guidelines section 15164, the 2020 Addendum contains no further

27 explanation to shed any light on this barebones conclusion. The same is true for the 3-5-20 Staff

28 Report and Planning Commission Resolution No. 20-3775-i.e., they contain only unfounded,

25
Petition For Writ of Mandate

1 conclusory statements regarding the requirements of section 15162 with no analysis of the Project-

2 specific facts to explain why the City decided that none of the conditions listed in section 15162 had

3 occurred that would have otherwise triggered the requirement to prepare a Subsequent EIR for the

4 Project.

5 101. The provisions of section 15163 of the CEQA Guidelines regarding the use of a

6 Supplemental, as opposed to a Subsequent, EIR are nowhere mentioned in the Addendum, the Staff

7 Report, or Planning Commission Resolution No. 20-3775, indicating that the City failed to adequately

8 consider whether Supplemental EIR would have been appropriate for the Project.
3. The Preparation Of A Subsequent Or Supplemental EIR Is Required For The Project.
10 102. The City has failed to address the readily available facts showing that the type of project

11 changes, changed circumstances, and new information described in CEQA section 21166 and CEQA

12 Guidelines sections 15162, 15163, and 15168 are present with respect to the Project and require the

13 preparation of a Subsequent EIR or, at the very least, a Supplemental EIR, for the Project.

14 103. The 2010 PEIR does not address, much less even contemplate, the Project being

15 developed at the Project Site. That fact alone will require "major revisions" to the 2010 PEIR to

16 address the significant environmental impacts, project alternatives, and mitigation measures associated
17 with the Project. As noted above, the Project was never contemplated by the 2010 PEIR because The

18 City assumed that the "existing" and "potential" land uses at the Project Site, referred to as "Project 65"

19 in the 2010 PEIR, would remain "fixed" and that there would be no material project changes in the

20 future.

21 104. If developed, the Project would result in a nearly three hundred and sixty percent

22 (360%) increase in square footage development at the Project Site (275,000 SF of office buildings, not

23 even including the 317,812 SF parking structure). If the parking structure were accounted for, the

24 result would be a nearly 700% increase in square footage development. Nowhere in the 2010 PEIR

25 were the impacts of such massive development at the Project Site analyzed, or even envisioned.

26 105. As depicted in Appendix 10 of Appendix F to the 2010 PEIR, TAZ 420, in which the

27 Project Site is located, was envisioned to add 169 residential units at post-2030 buildout, as well as
28 adding 13,000 square feet of office use. In addition, it was also expected to experience a corresponding

26
Petition For Writ of Mandate

1 decrease of 41,000 square feet of industrial use. No retail was envisioned to change in TAZ 420 by

2 buildout. Compared to the 13,000 square feet of additional office use in TAZ 420 that was

3 contemplated by the 2010 PEIR, the Project exceeds that amount by over 260,000 square feet, without

4 even counting the 318,000 square foot parking structure. This massive increase in development

5 constitutes a "material change" for "Project 65" within the meaning of CEQA section 21166 and the

6 CEQA Guidelines section 15162, and requires preparation of a Subsequent EIR (assuming arguendo

7 that such sections apply in this case)

8 106. The development "circumstances" contemplated by the 2010 PEIR have materially

9 changed over the past decade. For example, as explained below, a number of critically important

10 mitigation measures that the 2010 PEIR assumed would significantly, if not fully, mitigate the

11 transportation impacts associated with the buildout of the IBC Vision Plan have never materialized. In

12 addition, as noted above, the remaining non-residential development potential in the IBC has increased

13 by approximately 1.4 to 1.6 million square feet over what was assumed ten years ago in the 2010 PEIR.

14 107. New information that was not available when the 2010 PEIR was prepared now shows

15 that the Project will have new significant environmental effects with respect to transportation impacts

16 measured by VMT, GHG emissions, aesthetics, traffic safety hazards, light and glare, incompatibility

17 of land uses, etc. As noted above, these impacts were not addressed in the 2010 IBC PEIR because the

18 Project was not anticipated at that time.

19 108. Since the 2010 PEIR never contemplated that the Project would be developed at the

20 Project Site, the 2010 PEIR is devoid of any discussion of feasible mitigation measures or reasonable

21 project alternatives that could substantially reduce one or more significant effects of the Project. As

22 such, without a new EIR being prepared, there will be no analysis of, and the public will not be

23 afforded the opportunity to review and comment on, any project alternatives to reduce the tremendous

24 size of the Project or to mitigate any of its new significant environmental impacts.

25 109. The 2020 Addendum contains no discussion of any such alternatives or mitigation

26 measures relating to the Project. Such an analysis is typically and properly set forth in a draft EIR that

27 s circulated for public review and comment.

28 110. As explained hereinabove and hereinbelow, there are project changes, changed

27
Petition For Writ of Mandate

circumstances, and new information regarding significant impacts, feasible mitigation measures, and
reasonable project alternatives relating to the Project that would require the preparation of a Subsequent
or Supplemental EIR for the Project.

4. The Project Will Result In New Significant Transportation Impacts In The Form Of Traffic Safety Hazards, And This Will Require The Preparation Of A Subsequent EIR.

6 111. The Project would substantially increase traffic safety hazards due to geometric design

7 features, including a "knuckle" roadway curve and dangerous driveways and street conditions. The
Project will take access in approximately the same location as the existing driveway (Driveway No. 3)
that currently serves the 22,172 square feet of office use and 32,862 square feet of manufacturing use

10 associated with the existing development, as described in the IBC Database. The Project will consist of

11 275,000 square feet of office use that has the potential, based on the ITAM's distribution to add

12 approximately 70% of its traffic to this driveway in the PM Peak. This creates a safety hazard at

13 Driveway No. 3 because of the location of the driveway at the "knuckle" where Hale Avenue turns into

14 Gates Avenue.

15 112. The placement of Driveway No. 3 is unusual, confusing, and unsafe because the

16 eastbound exiting through movement from the driveway merges with a northbound through movement,

17 that is actually a northbound right turn movement at the 90° bend in the roadway. The confusion to

18 both drivers as to clear right-of-way results in an unsafe condition. The northbound inbound left-turn

19 movement is atypically and unclearly executed in conflict with a westbound through movement that is

20 actually a westbound left turn. This will create confusion for both drivers as to clear right-of-way. This

21 situation is compounded with the sight distance issues due to the 90° bend in the roadway. Therefore,

22 the Project will substantially increase traffic safety hazards due to geometric design features and this

23 will cause additional significant adverse impacts on transportation.

24 113. At the February 18, 2020 Transportation Commission public meeting on the Project

25 TIA, public testimony indicated that the industrial park generates a large number of incoming and

26 outgoing semi-trailer truck deliveries because of the nature of the businesses within the industrial park.

27 The Project TIA does not analyze the atypical existing condition in determining the Project's impact of

28 locating a 275,000 square foot office development in the industrial park that uses the same streets. The

28
Petition For Writ of Mandate

public testimony further indicated that the existing users of the streets in the industrial park are also

2 predominantly manufacturing uses which require semi-trailer trucks to block the street during the time

3 it takes to back into a driveway for loading and unloading.

4 114. The Project Site is located in one of the most congested areas of the City. The
intersection of Jamboree Road and Barranca Parkway is over 100% congested with a LOS of F, which

6 means "failure." The concerns expressed by local business owners at the February 18th meeting was

7 that, by adding thousands of new vehicles on to the Industrial Park's streets, unsafe conditions will be
created because of the conflict between the office building drivers and the existing semi-trailer truck

9 backing-up maneuvers. In this regard, the Project will substantially increase traffic safety hazards due

10 to incompatible uses: semi-trailer trucks versus office vehicles. This will result in additional significant

11 adverse impacts on transportation.

12 5. The Project Will Result In New Significant Air Quality Impacts In The Form Of GHG Emissions, And This Will Require The Preparation Of A
13 Subsequent EIR.

14 115. The 2020 Addendum states on page 66 that the 2010 PEIR determined that, through

15 implementation of all feasible PPP's, PDFs, and additional measures in the City's Zoning Code,

16 Section 9-36-20 Environmental Standards, the "proposed project" would achieve required GHG

17 emission reductions and its quantitative emissions would be considered less than significant. The

18 "proposed project" referred to in that context is not Gemdale's Project and will cause significant air

19 quality impacts in the form of GHG emissions. Given the passage of ten years since the 2010 PEIR

20 was certified, several PPP's and PDF's in the PEIR are no longer adequate to mitigate these significant

21 GHG impacts.

22 116. Transit Service to LAX (PPP 15-9). The Irvine Transit Station, located at 15215

23 Barranca Parkway in the eastern area of the city near the Spectrum, no longer provides direct transit

24 services to LAX. The service was ended in 2012. Service to LAX is provided from the Irvine Transit

25 Station via Metrolink with a bus connection at Union Station into Los Angeles. This results in adding

26 55 minutes to the commute time over the direct bus connection from Irvine Transit Station to LAX.

27 The added commute time discourages the use of transit and increases the IBC Vision Plan's generation

28 of GHG emissions over and above what was analyzed in the 2010 PEIR. As shown by Table 2 of

29
Petition For Writ of Mandate

Appendix P, IBC VMT Estimates and Trip Reduction Strategies - Update by Fehr & Peers 2009, of the

2 2010 PEIR assumes a .25% reduction in VMT and GHG with the implementation of the Flyway

3 Shuttle between Irvine Transit Station and LAX. That assumption is no longer valid, but the failure to

4 achieve presumed mitigation for the IBC Vision Plan was not addressed in the 2020 Addendum.

5 117. New Fixed Routes (PPP 15-11). This PPP states that the City will provide additional

6 routes to the existing i Shuttle system that is funded by OCTA and the City. The Irvine Transit Vision,

7 June 2009, identified six new shuttle routes to provide services within the City. The City has not

8 implemented six new shuttle routes and the shuttle service has a frequency over 15 minutes. Service

9 that is greater than 15 minutes does not meet the definition of a Major Transit Stop in order to reduce

10 VMT. CEQA Guidelines Appendix N, Infill Project Streamlining provides a definition of Major

11 Transit Stop: "Major Transit Stop" means a site containing an existing rail transit station, a ferry

12 terminal served by either a bus or rail transit service, or the intersection of two or more major bus

13 routes with frequencies of service intervals of 15 minutes or less during the morning and afternoon

14 peak commute periods. For the purposes of this Appendix, an 'existing major transit stop' may include

15 a planned and funded stop that is included in an adopted regional transportation improvement

16 program."

17 118. At the February 18, 2020 Transportation Commission meeting, in connection with Item

18 Irvine Business Complex Transportation Management System, staff reported that the funding for the

19 Shuttle would terminate in 2040 for the three (3) existing routes in the IBC. The funding might be

20 extended until 2046 if the City reduced the number of routes to two (2). Accordingly, the City has not

2] fully implemented PPP 15-11 and has now discussed reducing the services. This would result in a

22 significant increase in the amount of GHG emissions generated by the IBC over and above what was

23 2 analyzed in the 2010 PEIR. Table 2 of Attachment 6 indicates that the 2010 PEIR assumes a 6 1%

24 reduction in VMT and GHG with the implementation of six (6) new fixed routes to the i Shuttle. That

25 assumption is no longer valid, but the failure to achieve the presumed mitigation for the IBC Vision

26 Plan was not addressed in the 2020 Addendum.

27 119. High Rate of Internal Trip Capture (PDF 15-4). This PDF assumes the IBC Vision Plan

28 will significantly reduce trips outside the IBC with the inclusion of a mix of land uses including, office

30
Petition For Writ of Mandate

commercial, industrial, and residential in the IBC. However, the City has not implemented the design

2 criteria found in Appendix N of the Irvine General Plan that envisioned retail and office in the first-
floor levels of residential buildings. The City has approved all of the planned 15,000 residential units

4 and none of the residential projects approved after or with the certification of the 2010 PEIR have

5 provided retail or office in the first floor level oriented to the street, except for a small amount of retail

6 as an accessory use, similar to the coffee shop planned for the Project. The 2010 PEIR assumed that

7 the implementation of the IBC Vision Plan would result in mixed use residential projects to achieve

8 GHG reduction. That assumption is no longer valid, but the failure to achieve the presumed mitigation
for the IBC Vision Plan was not addressed in the 2020 Addendum.

10 120. Urban Infill Near Multiple Transit Modes (PDF 15-6). This PDF states that the IBC is

11 being served by a least two modes of transit, the i Shuttle connecting to Tustin Metrolink station and

12 John Wayne Airport. However, the frequency of service is greater than 15 minutes and does not meet

13 the definition of a Major Transit Stop that results in reduced VMT. The Project is not served by

14 effective transit within ½ mile or bus service with a service of 15 minutes or less. Orange County

15 Transportation Authority does not provide any bus service with a frequency of 15 minutes or less in the

16 area of the Project. As such, this PDF will not result in reducing the Project's GHG emissions, but the

17 failure to achieve the presumed mitigation for the IBC Vision Plan was not addressed in the 2020

18 Addendum.

19 121. TMA (PDF 15-7). The 2010 PEIR assumed a reduction in VMT of eight percent (8%)

20 with the implementation of an IBC TMA that was projected to be established in Spring of 2010.

21 However, the IBC TMA was never established. At the February 18, 2020 Transportation Commission

22 meeting in connection with Item 1, Irvine Business Complex Transportation Management System, staff

23 reported that the IBC TMA was not implemented because of lack of interest by the property owners

24 and businesses in the IBC. The IBC TMA needs to be applied to both existing and future development

25 In the IBC in order to achieve the 8% reduction in VMT and GHG. As shown by Table 2 of

26 Attachment 6, the 2010 PEIR assumes an eight percent (8%) reduction in VMT and GHG with the
27 implementation of the IBC TMA. That assumption is no longer valid, but the failure to achieve the

28 presumed mitigation for the IBC Vision Plan was not addressed in the 2020 Addendum.

6. The Project Does Not Qualify For A Class Infill 32 Exemption From CEQA
] Compliance And Thus The Project Will Result In Significant Adverse Air Quality Impacts As Discussed Above, And This Will Require The
2 Preparation Of A Subsequent EIR.

3 122. As noted earlier, without providing any explanation, the 2020 Addendum states on page

4 67 that the Project meets all of the conditions for a Class 32 Categorical Exemption as an infill

5 development under CEQA Guidelines section 15332. On the basis of this claimed exemption, the City

6 has improperly asserted that the Project qualifies for a Tier exemption from determining whether the

7 Project's GHG emissions meet the SCAQMD's significance threshold for such emissions.

8 123. However, in order to qualify for a Class 32 exemption from CEQA, subdivision (d) of

9 CEQA Guidelines section 15332 provides that the following condition must be met: "(d) Approval of

10 the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water

11 quality." The Project does not meet this condition because the Project will result in significant effects

12 to traffic in creating unsafe conditions to the circulation system and also by providing no mitigation to

13 reduce Project generated VMT. The Project will also result in significant effects to air quality, GHG

14 and VMT because PPP's and PDF's that were designed to mitigate the IBC Vision Plan environmental

15 effects have not been implemented and, in some cases, cannot be implemented.

16 124. Moreover, to the extent that the Project is relying on the 2010 PEIR to serve as its

17 CEQA compliance document, then the Project will result in significant effects to transportation, noise,

18 air quality, and water quality because the 2010 PEIR is inadequate and must be updated by another

19 EIR. The reason it is no longer adequate to address the impacts associated with development in the

20 IBC is because the amount of remaining nonresidential development potential in the IBC has increased

21 dramatically over the past ten years by some 1.4 to 1.6 million square feet, but this development

22 potential has not been analyzed by an EIR.

23 125. As discussed in Appendix C: Air Quality and Greenhouse Gas Emissions Analysis, to

24 the 2020 Addendum, there are currently interim GHG thresholds for determining significance of GHG

25 emissions. The current interim thresholds consist of a tiered approach. Since the Project does not meet

26 the qualifications for an exemption from CEQA, the Project does not meet the threshold for Tier

27 significance for GHG. The Tier 2 threshold is based on the Project's consistency with a GHG reduction

28 plan. As discussed above, the GHG reduction plan found in Appendix P of the 2010 PEIR has not been

32
Petition For Writ of Mandate

1 substantially implemented. The City has not implemented a safe route to school program in the IBC,

2 has not provided additional fixed route shuttle system to complement i Shuttle, has not provided transit

3 service from the City of Irvine to LAX, and has not established a TMA for the IBC.

4 126. Since the City has not implemented the GHG Reduction Plan established to reduce

5 VMT and GHG effects from the IBC Vision Plan, the Project, which is a later activity, is also not

6 consistent with the GHG Reduction Plan. The City has only implemented signal timing and

7 coordination and circulation phasing analysis to achieve a potential 2% reduction in GHG. However,

8 the purpose of these measures is to mitigate traffic delay, not GHG emissions. Therefore, the Project

9 exceeds the Tier 2 threshold for determining significant GHG impacts and will result in a significant

10 adverse effect on GHG.

11 127. Another condition for qualifying for a Class 32 exemption is set forth a in subdivision (a)

12 of CEQA Guidelines section 15332: "(a) Would the project conflict with an applicable plan, policy or

13 regulation adopted for the purpose of reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases? As discussed

14 below, the Project directly conflicts with the City's General Plan and Zoning Code in several different

15 respects and this is an additional reason why Class 32 exemption does not apply in this situation.

16 7. The Project Will Result In New Significant Aesthetic Impacts That Will Degrade The Visual Character Of The Surrounding Area, And This Will
17 Require The Preparation Of A Subsequent EIR.

18 128. As a guidance for evaluating aesthetic impacts, the Guidelines provide that public

19 agencies should consider whether a proposed a project would "substantially degrade the existing visual

20 character or quality of the site and its surroundings." As such, the Project's impact on the aesthetic

21 character of the adjoining industrial park is a proper subject of CEQA review and analysis.

22 129. The Project consists of two office buildings: 5-story structure that is 72 feet in height; a

23 6-story structure of that is 96 feet in height; and a 7-level parking structure that is 72 feet in height as

24 shown on the Project Plans, Attachment 3 of the March 5, 2020 Planning Commission Staff Report.

25 The Project is located in an area of the IBC that is predominantly single- and two-story structures

26 consisting of a .25 FAR. In fact, within a ½-mile radius of the Project there are only four (4) non-

27 residential structures consisting of 3-story office buildings, which are all located in Corporate Park

28 subject to CC&R's with design guidelines that do not allow above-ground parking structures. The

33
Petition For Writ of Mandate

height of the Project is not consistent with this northern area of the IBC, as demonstrated in the ½-mile

2 radius map submitted with Hale's March 4, 2020 letter to the City.

130. Also, the size of the Project is disproportionate to the surrounding properties. The
Project results in a development intensity of 1.27 FAR that is significantly out of proportion to the

5 existing Industrial Park at .25 FAR. A development intensity of 1.27 FAR is even greater than what is
typically seen along the I-405 Corridor for office parks. Although, IBC Zoning Code is no longer based
on a FAR, it gives a good comparison to the development intensity of the surrounding properties to the
proposed Project. The Project is located in TAZ No. 420, which currently has a total of 120,003 square
feet of office and 264,590 square feet of manufacturing. The Project is 275,000 square feet of office

10 which is 130% more than all the existing office within TAZ No. 420 placed on one parcel as shown in

11 Table 2, Existing Building Summary TAZ No. 420 in the 2010 PEIR.

12 131. The Project's parking structure is not compatible with the visual character of the
13 surrounding properties. The surrounding properties are comprised of surface parking lots. The parking

14 structure is massive in size consisting of 317,812 square feet, far larger than the two office buildings

15 combined at 275,000 square feet. The parking structure is a monolithic block with no articulation to

16 reduce the mass of the building. Moreover, the parking structure does not provide any architectural
17 I enhancement to the south or west elevations.

18 132. The industrial park in which the Project Site is located has a significantly different

19 visual character than the Project in that all three structures are significantly taller than the buildings in

20 the industrial park and the surrounding area. This is especially true when comparing the height of the

21 72-foot parking structure next to Hale's adjacent single-story building that is separated by only 10 feet.

22 The scale and character of the Project's office buildings and parking structure are incompatible with the

23 adjacent land uses and structures and would cause adverse and detrimental effects on existing onsite or

24 offsite visual character.

25 133. The 2020 Addendum's analysis to determine the significant aesthetic effects of the

26 Project based on how it might compare to other tall structures within the entire 2,700-acre IBC is not

27 appropriate. However, the Project's huge stand-alone seven-story parking structure would not compare

28 well to the vast majority of four to five story parking structures that serve the high-rise office towers in

34
Petition For Writ of Mandate

the IBC. Except for two recently constructed seven and eight story, above-ground parking structures
that serve massive office complexes at the Boardwalk and Lakeshore Towers developments, there are
virtually no other parking structures of such height and magnitude to be found anywhere in the IBC,
especially not located 10 feet from an existing one-story building. Moreover, the parking structures at

5 the Boardwalk and Lakeshore Towers developments appear to have been approved by City staff

6 without even a public hearing being held.

134. The 2020 Addendum fails to analyze the respective heights of the Project's office

8 buildings and parking structure in terms of their aesthetic impacts on the visual character of the
Industrial Park in which the Project Site is located or within a half mile of the Project Site. Such

10 impacts are clearly significant, and they were never addressed in the 2010 PEIR.

11 8. The Project Will Result In New Significant Aesthetic Impacts In The Form
Of Substantial Light And Glare Effects, And This Will Require The
12 Preparation Of A Subsequent EIR.

13 135. The Project includes a seven-story, above-ground parking structure that will be 72 feet

14 in height. The parking structure will be located just ten (10) feet from Hale's single-story building and

15 only five feet from the common property line. As shown on Project Plan Sheet A4.06, Parking

16 Structure Building Elevations, the south elevation of the parking structure provides no enhanced

17 treatment to the south and north elevations. This results in no architectural panels to screen light and

18 glare emanating from the parking structure since it is completely open.

19 136. The height of the parking structure combined with only a ten-foot building separation

20 will result in emitting direct light rays and glare from the upper levels of the parking structure when

21 viewed from the public sidewalk, streets and adjacent properties. An inspection by Hale's consultant

22 of the recently constructed parking structure serving the Boardwalk development has confirmed that

23 the Project's parking structure will cause significant adverse light and glare impacts. The Boardwalk

24 development is an office park located at 18555-18565-18575 Jamboree Road, and it was approved by

25 staff as a nondiscretionary project without any public hearing or public notice. The Boardwalk includes

26 an eight (8) level parking structure that is set back 30 feet from Teller Road and Dupont Drive. As

27 designed, the Project's parking structure will have similar adverse lighting conditions.

28 137. Parking structures are required by the Irvine Uniform Security Code section 5-9-518

35
Petition For Writ of Mandate

L.1 to have a minimum 1.25-foot candle. Such candle power will generate extremely intense light and

2 glare onto the adjacent sidewalks, streets and buildings in the surrounding Industrial Park which have
surface parking lots that were lighted with a minimum .25 foot-candle under the code in effect at the

4 time of construction. The Project's parking structure has an open unscreened stairwell that is located

5 near the southeast corner of the structure facing Hale Avenue and Gates Avenue. The Uniform Security
Code section 5-9-518 L.2 requires minimum of 2 foot-candles for stairwells. The 2010 PEIR includes
PPP-1-1 concerning mitigation for aesthetic environmental impacts: "PPP-1: As required by Chapter 3-

8 16, Lighting, of the City's Zoning Ordinance, outdoor lighting shall be designed and installed so that
all direct rays are confined to the site and adjacent properties are protected from glare. The level of

10 lighting on the site shall comply with the requirements of the City's Uniform Security Code." The

I1 interior lighting in the Project's parking structure is not "outdoor lighting."

12 138. The bare lighting fixtures located in the ceiling on each of the seven above-ground

13 levels of the Project's parking structure will emit direct rays onto the surrounding properties, sidewalks

14 and streets. The bright lighting from the Project's parking structure will create significant adverse light

15 and glare impacts on surrounding properties. A Subsequent EIR must be prepared to address

16 reasonable project alternatives and feasible mitigation measures to reduce the parking structure's light

17 and glare, such as by providing enhanced treatment on all sides of the parking structure and stairwells,

18 reducing the height of the structure to reduce the ceiling lights emitting direct rays and glare onto

19 adjacent properties and public sidewalk by locating levels below ground, increasing the setback from

20 the south property line, and providing meaningful landscaping to screen the mass of the structure.

21 139. The Glare Analysis Report in Appendix B to the 2020 Addendum did not include an

22 analysis of the light and glare impacts that will be caused by the Project's seven-story, above-ground

23 parking structure. Likewise, the 2010 PEIR contains no such analysis. Accordingly, the City has no

24 basis for stating in the 2020 Addendum that the Project's light and glare impacts are less than

25 significant. The actual facts are that the Project's parking structure alone will create significant adverse

26 light and glare impacts.

Petition For Writ of Mandate

9. The Project Will Result In Significant Land Use And Planning Impacts In The Form Of Conflicts With The City's General Plan And Zoning Code, And This Will Require The Preparation Of A Subsequent EIR.
140. In order to mitigate the Project's land use and planning impacts, such as incompatibility
3
with surrounding uses, the 2020 Addendum states that the Project will comply with the design criteria
set forth in PDF 8-1 from the 2010 PEIR and will also comply with the land use compatibility
standards in PDF 8-2 from that PEIR. However, these two PDF's apply to residential uses, not
6
nonresidential uses, such as the Project. Hence, this constitutes a conflict with the City's General Plan
7
and Zoning Code and that conflict, in turn, results in a significant adverse impact on land use and
8
planning.
9
141. The application of PDF 8-2, a residential compatibility standard has apparently been
10 included as part of the Project to avoid having to provide mitigation for the Project's aesthetic impacts
11
on surrounding properties. PDF 8-1 and PDF 8-2, as set forth in the 2010 PEIR, are specifically
12
applicable to new residential development and cannot be applied to reduce the Project's land use
13
impacts.
14
142. Element N, Irvine Business Complex, of the City's General Plan specifically provides
15 on1 page N-13 that the Design Criteria for the Overlay Zone only applies to residential projects. The
16
Project is clearly a nonresidential project. However, in much the same manner as invoking a Class 32
17
exemption to avoid having to identify and mitigate significant GHG impacts, the City is attempting to
18 apply the land use compatibility standards in PDF 8-2 as a means of avoiding having to mitigate the
19 significant adverse impacts on aesthetics that were discussed above. This constitutes a direct conflict
20 with Element N of the City's General Plan, resulting in a significant land use impact.
21
143. The 2020 Addendum is inadequate to determine the Project's significant environmental
22
land use and planning effects because it relies on the provisions in PDF 8-1 and PDF 8-2 to determine
23 compatibility with surrounding uses. In order for such Overlay Design Criteria to be made applicable
24 to the Project, a general plan amendment and zone change would need to be adopted by the Irvine City
25
Council.
26
144. The Project's March 5, 2020 staff report to the Planning Commission states that,
27
although the Project is nonresidential, it will contain design elements from the IBC Vision Plan for
28 consistency with surrounding area. The listed design criteria apply only to the two office buildings, but
37
Petition For Writ of Mandate

not to the massive 7-level parking structure that is greater than 220 linear feet in length with no 15-foot

2 breaks. The architectural treatment of painted metal fins is located only on the north and east elevation
of the parking structure. The south setback of the parking structure to the property line does not provide

4 enough area to plant meaningful screening trees and the height of the structure at 72 feet cannot be
screened by the planting of trees. The application of certain residential design criteria does not result in

6 mitigating the Project's effect on the surrounding uses. Here again, the Project results in significant

7 adverse effects to land use and planning due to its incompatibility with surrounding uses.

145. In addition, and as discussed below in sections 10 and 11, the development of the
Project will cause significant adverse land use and planning impacts because it will conflict with

10 section 9-36-18 of the City's Zoning Code (transfer of development rights), chapter 2-17 of the City's

11 Zoning Code (master plan), and policies (a) and (d) of the Land Use Element of the City's General

12 Plan.

13 10. Neither The 2010 PEIR, Nor The 2020 Addendum, Contains An Analysis Of The Project's Energy Impacts.
14 146. The Environmental Checklist in the CEQA Guidelines has been revised to add a section

15 on the energy impacts of a proposed project. The Initial Study for the Project that was included in the

16 2020 Addendum did not incorporate the required analysis of the significant energy impacts associated

17 with the Project. Likewise, the 2010 PEIR did not include an energy analysis of the IBC Vision Plan.
18 At this point, therefore, the required determination has not been made as to whether the Project will

19 result in significant environmental impacts due to wasteful, inefficient, or unnecessary consumption of

20 energy resources during project construction or operation. The cumulative effect of this omission and

21 the other deficiencies noted above should be rectified by the preparation of a Subsequent EIR.

22 11. All Reasonable Project Alternatives And All Feasible Mitigation Measures To Reduce The Significant Impacts Associated With The Project Should Be 23 Addressed In A Subsequent EIR.

24 147. As noted earlier, nowhere in the 2020 Addendum is there any discussion of whether,

25 within the meaning of Guidelines section 15162, new information shows that mitigation measures or

26 alternatives which are considerably different from those analyzed in the 2010 PEIR would substantially

27 reduce one or more of the Project's significant effects. There are no project alternatives discussed in

28 the 2010 PEIR that relate to the Project in any way. Accordingly, this is one of the principal reasons

38
Petition For Writ of Mandate

1 why a new EIR should be prepared to discuss a range of project alternatives to reduce the massive

2 Project being proposed by Gemdale.

3 12. The City Interfered With Public Participation In The CEQA Process By Charging An Unreasonable Fee To Provide A Statutorily Required Appeal
4 To The Elected Decisionmakers.

5 148. As indicated above, the City required Hale to pay the costs and fees associated with its

6 Request for Appeal of the Project, prior to and as a condition precedent for considering Hale's appeal,

7 and refused to consider SAFER's appeal when SAFER refused to pay a similar cost demand.

8 149. Since the City refused to answer basic questions about the fees, imposed fees on the

9 appellants for work done to oppose the fees, and failed to give any estimate of the fees in advance, the

10 City's demand amounted to an unreasonable requirement that Hale and SAFER agree to provide a

11 "blank check" to their own opponents to fund their defense against the Appeals. In addition, the actual

12 amount charged to and collected from Hale was patently unreasonable.

13 150. The City's unreasonable demands in this respect were intended to, and did in fact,

14 violate due process, and discourage public participation in the CEQA process by erecting an unfair and

15 unreasonable burden to the Appeals to the City Council, which were required to be provided under

16 Public Resources Code $ 21151.

17 The City's Violations Of The Irvine Zoning Code.

18 151. In addition to violating CEQA, the City's approval of the Project violated its own

19 zoning code, in the following ways:
1.
20 The Proposed Transfer Of Development Rights For The Project Does Not Meet The Conditions Specified In Section 9-36-18 Of The City's Zoning Code.
21
152. The Project proposes to transfer approximately 221,000 square feet of office
22 equivalency to the Project Site in order to develop a 275,000 square feet office project. The conditions
23 set forth in section 9-36-18 of the City's Zoning Code for approving a TDR are: (1) the project shall
24
not adversely affect City infrastructure and services and (2) there is no adverse impact on the
25
surrounding circulation system, such that the performance criteria as established in the 2010 PEIR are
26
maintained as a result of no impact, or adequate mitigation.
27
153. The Project results in an adverse impact on the surrounding circulation system and
28
cannot meet the criteria required in Condition No. 2 for the approval of a TDR application. Linscott,
39
Petition For Writ of Mandate

1 Law & Greenspan has provided a technical traffic review of Gemdale's Project TIA, dated February

2 11, 2020 ("LLG Review"). LLG lists several Project deficiencies and adverse impact to the circulation

3 system: (1) distance between driveways and intersections in that the main Project driveway onto Gates

4 Avenue is located only 32 feet from an existing driveway on Hale Avenue; (2) signal warrants
5 methodology at Millikan Avenue and Gates Avenue intersection is incorrect and the use of the correct

6 methodology would result in the need for a traffic a signal; and (3) Site Access Analysis results in driver

7 confusion as to right-of-way priority and the location of a major Project driveway at the "knuckle" of

8 the Gate Avenue/Hale Avenue intersection.

9 154. Distance Between Driveways. The Project results in an unsafe traffic condition because

10 the distances between full-access Driveway and 4 located on Gates Avenue does not meet the City's

11 transportation design procedure ("TDP") criteria. The Project requested a deviation from the standard

12 in preparing the Project's TIA, dated December 2019. In total, the Project has requested three (3)

13 deviations from standards as listed on page 2 in the Project TIA: (1) TDP-4: Right-Turn lanes at

14 Uncontrolled Driveways (for the Barranca Parkway right-in/right-out Driveways 1 and 2); (2) TDP-10:

15 Distance between Driveways and intersections (for the Barranca Parkway right-in/right-out Driveway

16 and the Gates Avenue full-access Driveways 3 and 4); and (3) TDP-14: Driveway Lengths (for

17 Barranca Parkway right-in/right-out Driveway 1). This constitutes an unusually high number of

18 deviations in preparing a traffic impact analysis for development projects in the City of Irvine. As

19 is such, there is the potential of a significant adverse effect to the circulation system because a sight
20 distance evaluation, a queuing assessment and access analysis was not conducted prior to allowing such

21 an unusually high number of deviations from standards.

22 155. Signal Warrant Millikan Avenue/Gates Avenue. The Project will cause a significant

23 adverse effect on the intersection of Millikan Avenue and Gates Avenue that would warrant a traffic

24 signal if the Project TIA had used the correct methodology to determine whether or not a traffic signal

25 is warranted. The peak hour traffic signal warrants were based on the ITAM traffic volumes prepared

26 for the intersection of Millikan Avenue/Gates Avenue (study intersection #18) and incorrectly included

27 the traffic of both minor street approaches. Only the highest minor street approach should be included

28 pursuant to the California Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD"). In addition, the

40
Petition For Writ of Mandate

peak hour traffic signal warrants assume two (2) or more lanes on both the major street (Millikan

2 Avenue) and the minor street (Gates Avenue). However, only one lane should have been included for

3 the minor street approaches. If the correct methodology is used, a traffic signal might be warranted. A

4 traffic signal requirement has not been included into the Project. Therefore, the Project will have an

5 adverse impact on the surrounding circulation system and, as such, Condition No. 2 in section 9-36-18

6 of the Zoning Code cannot be met to allow the proposed TDR for this Project to be approved.

7 156. Unsafe Condition at Driveway No. 3. The Project creates an unsafe traffic condition

8 and adverse impact on the surrounding circulation system because of the proximity of Project

9 Driveway No. 3 to the existing driveways on Hale Avenue. The Project's primary southern access is

10 located at the corner of the 90° bend where Hale Avenue turns into Gates Avenue (*knuckle"). The

11 existing driveway is 32 feet from this planned access (Driveway No. 3). Given the proximity of the two

12 driveways and the significant increase in ingress and egress from the Project traffic, as discussed in the

13 LLG Review, this will result in confusion between exiting and entering vehicles as to which driver has

14 the right-of-way priority since Driveway No. 3 is located at the knuckle. The placement of Driveway

15 No. 3 is atypical and unusual, confusing, and potentially unsafe because the eastbound exiting through

16 movement from the driveway merges with a northbound through movement, that is actually a

17 northbound right turn movement at the 90° bend in the roadway. The confusion to both drivers as to

18 clear right-of-way is an unsafe condition. The northbound inbound left-turn movement is atypically and

19 in unclearly executed in conflict with a westbound through movement that is actually a westbound left

20 turn. This will create confusion for both drivers as to clear right-of-way. This is compounded with the

21 sight distance issues due to the 90° bend in the roadway. Therefore, the Project will substantially

22 increase hazards due to geometric design features that will result in significant adverse impacts to the

23 surrounding circulation system.

24 157. Project Traffic Distribution. The Project is located is in one of the most congested areas of

25 the City as confirmed by a statement made by City Traffic Engineer Bourgeois at the February 18,

26 2020 Transportation Commission meeting. Jamboree Road operates at an LOS of F. Barranca Parkway

27 is the primary arterial to access Jamboree Road to access I-5 and SR 261. As stated in the LLG Review,

28 queuing patterns of existing PM Peak traffic on Barranca Parkway were observed that could result in

41
Petition For Writ of Mandate

1 vehicles exiting the parking structure onto Barranca Parkway to experience delay that could result in

2 more vehicles choosing Driveway No. 3 to exit the Project. The Project TIA did not include a queuing

3 analysis of this condition and the City approved changes to the ITAM distribution percentages as stated

4 on page 35 of the Project TIA. At the February 18, 2020 Transportation Commission meeting

5 regarding the Project TIA, City Traffic Engineer Bourgeois stated that the ITAM model's distribution

6 of the Project's traffic was a very reliable tool and she dismissed any challenge to its distribution

7 results. However, "minor" changes to the ITAM distribution were made by staff, the extent of which

8 were not identified in the Transportation Commission Staff Report or presentation. Table in

9 Appendix C of the Project TIA shows that 70% of the Project's traffic will exit at Driveway 3 onto

10 Gates Avenue at the 90 bend in the PM Peak rather than use Driveway from the parking structure

11 onto Barranca Parkway. This a would result in a significant adverse impact on the surrounding

12 circulation system.

13 158. Barranca Queuing Observations. The driveway assignment assumptions presented in

14 the Project TIA concerning ingress and egress of the traffic generated by the Project needs to be further

15 studied. LLG performed queuing observations of the traffic conditions on Barranca Parkway, Millikan

16 Avenue and Gates Avenue on Thursday January 9, 2020 during the PM peak period (i.e. 4:00 PM to

17 6:00 PM). LLG observed that vehicles queuing on Barranca Parkway waiting to make left turns at

18 Jamborec Road to go northbound at the Jamboree Road and Barranca Parkway intersection will impact

19 the Project's traffic exiting onto Barranca Parkway at Project Driveway 2 (easterly driveway) in that

20 56.6% (i.e. 26 out of the 46 cycles during the 2-hour observation period) of the time vehicles will not

21 be able to enter into the far left lane to queue for the westbound left-turn at the Jamboree and Barranca

22 intersection to travel northbound on Jamboree Road. The Project traffic exiting onto Barranca Parkway

23 from the Parking Structure (i.e. Project Driveway 1) will also have difficulty transitioning from Lane 3

24 (i.e. curb adjacent lane) into Lane 2 and Lane 1 to get to the triple left turn at Jamboree Road

25 (Attachment 13). The Project TIA did not analyze the queuing conditions on Barranca. This queuing

26 condition on Barranca Parkway may result in more drivers choosing to exit the Project site via the Hale

27 Avenue/Gates Avenue driveway (i.e. Project Driveway No. 3) than is assigned in the Project TIA. LLG

28 also observed the PM Peak Hour conditions at Millikan Avenue and Barranca Parkway. The

42
Petition For Writ of Mandate

northbound left turn lane queues back up to Gates Avenue. LLG observed that the Gates Avenue traffic

2 needs to wait until the queuing traffic clears on Millikan Avenue at the intersection of Barranca

3 Parkway. This condition would increase the Project's impact to the intersection of Millikan Avenue

4 and Gates, Millikan Avenue and Barranca Parkway and possibly other area intersections than identified

5 in the Project TIA.

6 159. Project Cannot Meet Conditions For Approving Proposed TDR. As noted above, the

7 Project cannot meet the requirements of Condition No.2 for the granting of a TDR, therefore,

8 Gemdale's TDR should not have been granted because of (1) the use of an incorrect signal warrant
9 methodology for the Millikan Avenue and Gates Avenue intersection, and (2) the distance between

10 Project Driveway No. 3 and the existing driveways on Hale Avenue that creates an unsafe condition by

11 causing confusion of driver right-of-way priority.

12 2. The Proposed Master Plan For The Project Does Not Meet The Conditions Specified In Chapter 2-17 Of The City's Zoning Code.
13 160. Irvine Zoning Code Section 2-17-1 establishes the intent of a master plan to be the

14 resolution of major issues associated with the development of certain sites. That section lists eight (8)

15 primary issues of concern when evaluating a master plan application. These issues include evaluation

16 of existing and planned development on adjoining and proximate parcels, location of proposed

17 buildings, access to the project site, distribution and amount of parking and identification and

18 mitigation of project impacts.

19 161. A request for consideration of a a TDR to a receiving parcel requires the approval of a
20 master plan by the Planning Commission. The evaluation of the TDR is not only based on a traffic

21 study's conclusions, but the Planning Commission must also make sure the added development

22 intensity proposed by the TDR is compatible with the adjoining and proximate parcels, especially
23 concerning project design in relationship to existing buildings on adjoining parcels, project access in
24 relationship to existing access for adjoining parcels, the project's impact on transportation, and whether
25 the project's impacts have been identified and mitigated.

26 162. The Project does not meet the intent of a master plan because the Project is not

27 compatible with adjacent properties and surrounding area of the IBC because of intensity of

28 development, mass and size of buildings, and location of parking structure. Moreover, as discussed

43
Petition For Writ of Mandate

above, Project access, adverse impacts to the circulations system and Project's environmental impacts

2 have not been identified, analyzed or mitigated.

3 163. Although section 3-37-39 of the City's Zoning Code establishes a zero setback for the

4 rear property line, in this case since the properties is bounded by two streets, there is not a technical

5 rear property line. The March 5, 2020 Project Staff Report indicates the setback provided for the

6 parking structure located on the south property line is five (5) feet. is This setback is insufficient to

7 mitigate the placement of the 7-level, above-ground parking structure next to the one-story building

8 that is ten feet away. Five (5) feet is also insufficient to place meaningful landscape screening between

9 the parking structure and the existing building.

10 164. The Project driveways on Gates Avenue create an unsafe condition as described in

11 detail above. These driveways do not meet Irvine design standards and Driveway No. 3 should be

12 eliminated and project alternatives be considered. The size and massing of the Project is not compatible

13 with the surrounding properties or surrounding area as discussed in detail above. The office buildings

14 are too tall compared to the surrounding area and need to be reduced in height and oriented to Barranca

15 Parkway, a major arterial highway. Meaningful project alternatives should be considered to reduce the

16 size of the Project.

17 165. The planned congregate care facility at Millikan Avenue and Gates Avenue is not an

18 appropriate measure of Project's compatibility to the surrounding area. The City approved a 424,113

19 square foot congregate care facility consisting of 340 units in two 8-story towers in October 2018 on

20 the corner of Barranca Parkway and Millikan Avenue just after August 2018 when the 15,000

21 residential-unit IBC maximum dwelling count had been reached. The City determined it was an

22 institutional land use and not subject to the maximum dwelling count established in the IBC. In

23 appearance, the congregate care facility looks like the residential developments located to the south

24 near Jamboree Road and Alton Parkway other than it is 129 feet tall compared to the 75-foot height

25 limit for residential development in the IBC.

26 166. The typical parking requirement for congregate care facility is 1 parking space per 3

27 beds, since a majority of the residents do not drive, and the parking is primarily for the employees and

28 visitors. Using the typical parking requirements for congregate care, it would result in a need of 114

44
Petition For Writ of Mandate

1 parking spaces, not the 325 parking spaces the project provided. The congregate care facility described

2 in the staff report is a similar to a senior living facility with the age limit of 62, the number of

3 independent living units, and the amount of parking provided. The City used an uncirculated addendum

4 instead of a subsequent EIR for this project that also may not have been within the scope of the 2010

5 PEIR. Project alternatives to reduce the size and height of the project might have been considered if

6 the public had an opportunity to provide meaningful comments on the project's adverse impacts.

7 167. The Project is not consistent with the City's General Plan because the Project has

8 significant adverse effect on surrounding manufacturing and industrial uses and therefore is in conflict

9 with General Plan Land Use Element Policy (a): Retain and attract manufacturing and industrial uses

10 within designated business centers. The Project will create unsafe access conditions to Gates Avenue

11 and Hale Avenue, the need for a traffic signal at Millikan Avenue and Gates Avenue, and the Project's

12 traffic may conflict with existing industrial and manufacturing use of semi-trailer trucks that will

13 adversely impact the surrounding manufacturing and industrial uses of the Industrial Park.

14 168. The Project is also not consistent with the City's General Plan because the Project has a

15 significant adverse effect on the surrounding circulation system that has resulted in a negative impact

16 of the Project from automobiles. The Project conflicts with General Plan Land Use Element Policy (g):

17 Include mitigation measures in the approval of all proposed developments to minimize negative

18 impacts of the automobile. The Project will create unsafe access conditions to Gates Avenue and Hale

19 Avenue, the need for a traffic signal at Millikan Avenue and Gates Avenue, and Project's traffic may

20 conflict with existing industrial and manufacturing use of semi-trailer trucks that will adversely impact

21 the surrounding circulation system.

22 169. The Project is also not consistent with the City's Zoning Code because the Project has

23 used residential zoning standards and design criteria for residential development found in Section 5.8

24 of the Irvine Zoning Code to attempt to limit the definition of project compatibility to only compliance

25 with the Zoning Code, instead of considering the Project's compatibility with the adjacent properties

26 and surrounding area.

27 170. The Project is not in the best interest of the public health, safety and welfare of the

28 community because the Project has significant adverse effects to transportation, circulation system,

45
Petition For Writ of Mandate

safety, light and glare, land use and planning, air quality and greenhouse gases. The Project is out of

2 proportion with adjacent properties concerning size, massing, and building location. The 2020

3 Addendum prepared for the Project is not adequate to address the significant environmental impacts

4 and is not in compliance with CEQA.

5 171. In light of the foregoing, the City could not have properly made the required findings

6 necessary to approve the MPA for the Project and the City's approval thereof should be voided.

7 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

8 (For A Writ Of Mandate To Compel Compliance

9 With The California Environmental Quality Act)

10 172. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference each and every allegation

11 contained in paragraphs 1 through 150, inclusive, as set forth above.

12 173. In committing the various acts, errors, and omissions alleged in this Petition and in light

13 of the numerous violations of CEQA and the Guidelines that are alleged in 1 paragraphs 1 through 150,

14 above, Respondents have failed to proceed in the manner required by law and have abused their

15 discretion.

16 174. As a result of the violations of CEQA and the Guidelines outlined herein, Petitioner is

17 entitled to a peremptory writ of mandate under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, which,

18 inter alia:

20 they have taken, or may hereafter take, in (i) denying Hale's appeal and approving Gemdale's Project;

21 and (ii) issuing any permits, approvals, or other land use entitlements of any kind in reliance on the

22 2010 PEIR or the 2020 Addendum and relating to the Project, including, but not limited to, the

23 approval of any site plans, conditional use permits, construction permits, grading permits, or demolition

24 permits relating thereto;

25 174.2 Directs Respondents and Real Parties to suspend any and all activities relating to

26 the Project to the extent that any such activities could result in any adverse change or alteration to the
