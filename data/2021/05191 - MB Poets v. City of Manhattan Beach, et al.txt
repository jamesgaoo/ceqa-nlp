Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 1. INTRODUCTION
This action challenges the City of Manhattan Beach's ("City's") failure to comply
3 with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") and the City's Municipal Code in
4 approving a retail commercial project at 600 Sepulveda Avenue in the City proposed by MB
5 Hotel Partners, LLC.

6 2. This proposed project provides for the development of a new 162-room, 81,775
7 square-foot hotel and a 16,348 square foot retail and office building at 600 S. Sepulveda
8 ("Project"). The proposal, including a 40-foot tall wall with hotel room windows overlooking
9 the adjacent residential neighborhood to the east, would make this the tallest building along

11 10 Sepulveda in Manhattan Beach. Parking would be severely lacking, as only 152 parking spaces
(29 surface and 123 underground) would be provided, despite the Project requiring 243 parking
12 spaces under applicable provisions of the Municipal Code. Cars in search of spaces will create

14 13 environmental impacts and inevitably result in overflow parking on neighborhood streets.
3. The a Project requires a discretionary approval of a Master Use Permit, thus
15 necessitating compliance with CEQA. This discretionary review provided the City the ability to
16 impose conditions of approval to reduce the impacts associated with the Project. For example,

18 17| restrictions on the height, design, building placement, and hours of operation were imposed but

19 were not sufficient to eliminate impacts.

4.

TN The City approved this impactful Project based upon a Class 32 categorical a
20 exemption to environmental review under CEQA for infill development that has no unusual
21 impacts. This categorical exemption is inapplicable because the Project would result in traffic
22 impacts due to increased commercial traffic using quiet residential streets and busy city
23 thoroughfares, increased traffic on a state highway (Sepulveda Boulevard) with short sightline
24 distances in this critical area, and create a demand in severe excess of the parking capacity of the
25 site. The Project would also have adverse noise impacts on the surrounding residential
26 community both during construction and operations. The use of a categorical exemption is also

28 27 improper because the Project may have aesthetic impacts, create significant impacts at a Project

2

1 and cumulative level, and require conditions of approval to mitigate potential impacts.
2 Moreover, even if this class of exemption were applicable, the City could not rely on it for the
3 Project due to the Project's potential impacts to the area, the cumulative impacts of this type of

4 Project and the unusual circumstances of this Project's precedent setting size and intensity. An

5 exemption from CEQA was further impermissible because the City had to impose mitigation

6 measures in an attempt to mitigate various potentially significant impacts. No exemption is
7 permissible where mitigation measures are necessary to reduce impacts below a level of
8 significance.
5. The Project would have severe impacts in an area of Manhattan Beach renowned
10 for its peace and quiet, with streets named after Keats, Tennyson, and Shelley known as "the
11 Poets Section."

12 6. For all of these reasons, the City should have required a full environmental impact
13 report (EIR) to determine the extent of the Project's impacts, and require Project revisions and
14 mitigation measures to address those impacts. The City also prematurely and improperly filed a
15 Notice of Exemption following the approval by its Planning Commission of the Project, but
16 before the time for an appeal of that approval had expired.
17 7. The violations of CEQA by the City have necessitated the filing of this action to
18| obtain a writ of mandate setting aside approval of the Project until proper environmental review
19 has been prepared and other appropriate relief. Accordingly, Petitioner requests that this Court
20 issue a peremptory writ of mandate to prevent the City or Real Parties in Interest from taking
21 actions based on the faulty Project approval and to require the preparation of environmental
22 review for the Project.
23
*: JURISDICTION
24 8. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1085 and 1094.5 of the
25 Code of Civil Procedure, and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

19 The Project Site. STATEMENT OF FACTS

20 16. The Project site is located at 600 South Sepulveda Boulevard in the City of
21 Manhattan Beach. The site is located in Area District 1 and is zoned CG-D8, General
22 Commercial- Sepulveda Boulevard Corridor Overlay. The surrounding properties are zoned™
23 CG-D8 to the north, CG General Commercial to the South (across Tennyson Street), RS Single-
24 Family Residential to the East (across Chabela Drive), a narrow commercial strip to the west
25 and behind that, R-1 Single Family Residential (both across Sepulveda Boulevard in the City of
26 Hermosa Beach)

27

28

17. The site's former use was as an El Torito restaurant. However, that restaurant
2 vacated the site in late 2018. The site is stated to be a 65,419 square foot lot (Page 90 of 1060
3 of Staff Report dated November 18, 2020). The restaurant occupied 8,500 square feet of the

4 site. Skechers has been occupying the site since 2019, using the restaurant building as a
corporate cafeteria and meeting space while using the parking lot as overflow parking for
Skechers employees impacted by construction at Skechers' new office buildings along
7 Sepulveda Boulevard. The restaurant building would be demolished for the project.
8 The Project

9 18. In early 2019, the City approved the Sepulveda Boulevard Corridor Overlay.
10 Among other changes to long-standing zoning and land use restrictions in the area, this Overlay
11 allowed a 40-foot height limit for hotel uses in the D8-Sepulveda Corridor Overlay Zone.
12 Environmental analysis of the Overlay zone was segmented from the hotel project currently
13 proposed, even though the proposed hotel Project was contemplated and specifically known to
14 City staff at the time the Overlay was reviewed. No environmental review of the Overlay
15 Zone was conducted as the Ordinance approving the Overlay stated: "It can be seen with
16 certainty that there is no possibility that the adoption of this Ordinance, and the amendments to
17| the commercial development standards or the zoning map established hereby, may have a
18 significant effect on the environment. Future discretionary development projects shall be
19 subject to CBQA and shall be subject to environmental review. The adoption of this Ordinance
20 is therefore not a "project" within the meaning of CEQA and is exempt pursuant to CEQA =- 21 Guidelines Section 15061(b)(3)." Despite the statement in the ordinance approving the Overlay
22 Zone that "Future discretionary development projects shall be subject to CEQA and shall be
23 subject to environmental review," the City approved the Project with no environmental review
24 and claimed it was exempt from CEQA.
25 19. On August 9, 2019, the Community Development Department received an
26 application requesting a Master Use Permit for a new 162-room, 81,775 square-foot, four-story
27 hotel and a separate new 16,348 square foot two-story retail and office building at 600 S.
28

5

1 Sepulveda, at the northeast corner of Sepulveda Boulevard and Tennyson Street.

2 20. The Planning Commission conducted a public hearing on October 14, 2020 to
3 consider the request for the Master Use Permit. Numerous public comments were submitted in
4 opposition to this proposal. Many of the comments objected to the lack of adequate notice of
5 the proposal. The hearing was continued to November.

6 21. On November 18, 2020, the Planning Commission held another public hearing.
7 Again, numerous public comments were submitted, most of them in opposition to the Project as
8 proposed. MB Poets submitted detailed comments objecting to various aspects of the Project,
9 and included expert testimony regarding parking, traffic, noise, and land use impacts.
10 Objections were also raised by UNITE HERE Local 11. Despite these many and detailed
11 objections, the Planning Commission adopted a resolution approving the Project.

12 22. Following the approval by the Planning Commission, but prior to the expiration of
13 the 15-day appeal period provided by the Manhattan Beach Municipal Code, the City prepared
14 a Notice of Exemption and it was filed. This Notice of Exemption was prematurely filed and
15 thus was invalid.

16 23. MB Poets appealed the Planning Commission approval to the City Council by
17 delivering and appeal to the City on November 25. 2020. The City did not acknowledge receipt
18 of this appeal until December 1, 2020. UNITE HERE Local 11 also filed an appeal on
19 December 2, 2020.

20 24. The City communicated with MB Poets representatives about scheduling a hearing
21 of their appeal on January. 19, 2021 or February 2, 2021. The Manhattan Beach Municipal
22 Code requires the setting of à hearing on an appeal within 60 days of the filing of the appeal.
23 As of the date of the filing of this petition the City had not yet scheduled a hearing of the MB
24 Poets appeal.

25 25. As of the time of the filing of this Petition, as far as Petitioner knows, the City has
26 not withdrawn or declared the notice of exemption posted for the Project to be invalid. Notice
27 of Exemption number SCH 2020110325 for the Project is still listed as filed on the State
28

Clearinghouse at https://ceqanet.opr.ca.gov/.

2 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

3 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

4 26. Petitioner MB Poets objected to the Project in the administrative process by
5 submitting letters during the comment period and providing testimony at public meetings

6 regarding the Project.

7 27. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
8 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate and injunctive relief. In the absence of

9 such remedies, the City's approval of the Project would form the basis for a development project
10 that would proceed in violation of state law.

11 28. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 by filing a
12 copy of this petition with the California Attorney General. A copy of that notice is attached as
13 Exhibit A.

14 29. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by providing
15 the City with notice of its intention to commence the action. A copy of that notice is attached as
16 Exhibit B.

17 30. Petitioner elects to prepare the administrative record. A copy of that election is
18 attached as Exhibit C.

19 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (VIOLATION OF CEQA)
21 31. Petitioner incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.
22 32. CEQA requires the City to conduct an adequate environmental review prior to
23 making any formal decision regarding projects subject to the Act. (CEQA Guidelines § 15004).
24 The City has failed to do so for the Project, in violation of CEQA.
25 33. The City has relied on a Class 32 categorical exemption to approve the Project,
26 under CEQA Guidelines § 15332. The City's reliance on this categorical exemption is legally
27 inadequate for several reasons, including but not limited to the following.
28

1 The City Failed to Prove the Project Fits Within a Categorical Exemption

2 34. Class 32 categorical exemptions exempts in-fill projects from environmental review
3 if the following conditions have been met:

4 a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable

5 general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations.

6 (d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic,

7 noise, air quality, or water quality.

8 (e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.

9 (CEQA Guidelines § 15332.)
10 35. Categorical exemptions may be provided only for "classes of projects which have
11 been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment..." and should be construed
12 in light of that authorization. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21084, subd. (a).) §
13 36. Categorical exemptions are strictly construed, "in order to afford the fullest
14 possible environmental protection." (Save Our Carmel River v. Monterey Peninsula Water
15 Management Dist. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 677, 697.) It is the City's burden to prove that the
16 proposed Project fits within this class of categorical exemption. (California Farm Bureau Fed'n
17 V. California Wildlife Conservation Bd., (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 185-86.) The City has
18 failed to meet its burden in proving the Project correctly fits within a Class 32 categorical
19 exemption.
20 37. The Project does not fit within this class of categorical exemption for several
21 reasons including but not limited to the following.
22 38. First, the Project is not consistent with applicable land use plans and regulations.
23 The Project fails to provide the Municipal Code required parking. The Project exceeds the
24 allowable Floor to Area (FAR) ratio. Municipal Code required findings, including but not
25 limited to those concerning public safety and welfare (Mun. Code section 10.84.060.A subd. (2)
26 and (4)), cannot be made.
27 39. A Class 32 exemption is unavailable because the Project is inconsistent with the
28

City's Municipal Code requirements for parking. Staff stated that Manhattan Beach Municipal
2 Code (MBMC) Section 10.64.030 requires 243 spaces be provided for the site based on
3 proposed uses. (Oct. 14, 2020 Memorandum, p. 4 of 829; Nov. 18, 2020 Memorandum, p. 90 of

4 1060.). However, the City claimed this amount can be reduced pursuant to MBMC Section
5 10.64.050 (B) which allows reduction of required parking. The revised project thus has a total of a

6 only 152 parking spaces, 91 spaces fewer than required by the MBMC.

7 40. Insufficient parking at a project can lead to environmental impacts from increased
8 vehicle emissions and vehicle miles traveled and overflow parking in the nearby residential
9 neighborhood. "CEQA considers project's impact on parking of vehicles to be a physical
10 impact that could constitute a significant effect on the environment.» (Taxpayers for
11 Accountable School Bond Spending v. San Diego Unified School Dist. (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th
12 1013, 1051.)

13 41. The parking analysis performed by Kimley-Horn and Associates ["KMA"] makes
14 unjustifiable assumptions that are not based on substantial evidence. For example, the KMA
15 parking analysis uses unjustifiably low levels of parking demand based on unsupportable
16 application of parking ratios. The ITE- Institute of Traffic Engineer's standard requirement for
17 spaces is 1.55 spaces per hotel room on Saturdays, but the applicant uses a ratio of only 0.64.
18 This results in a peak-parking demand that is only 41% of the industry standard.
19 42. As result, the KMA parking analysis violates Manhattan Beach Municipal Code
20 "MBMC"] § 10.64.040, Collective Provision for Parking. This statute permits a maximum
21 reduction of 15% in spaces.if multiple uses on site share the parking at different times of day.
22 The municipal code permits a 36-space reduction, whereas the applicant erroneously took an 83-
23 space reduction, 225% larger than permitted by code. As result, the city has not applied its
24 parking ordinance uniformly, which renders the parking shortage an environmental impact, per
25 CEQA Guidelines section 15183 subdivisions (f) and (g).
26 43. Independent expert opinion analysis discloses that the KMA parking analysis
27 excludes parking demand from public use of hotel alcohol-serving venues. A conservative
28

estimate of parking for an event on the 4th-floor terrace and bar equals 70 additional spaces not
2 included by KMA in their analysis. Condition 14 in Resolution No. PC 20-XX restricts alcohol

3 service to hotel patrons only. (Nov. 18, 2020 Memorandum, p. 11 of 1060.) The application,
4 however, specifies a Type 47 on-sale general license. (Ibid. p. 107 of 1060.) For this full liquor

5 license, the Department of Alcohol Beverage Control ["ABC*] requires a bona fide public

6 eating place, which cannot be restricted to hotel guests only.

7 44. The impact of the significant underparking of the Project site would mean that cars

8 not parked on-site would need to leave the site (adding further to disruption of traffic flow on
9 Sepulveda and surrounding streets at the already overloaded junctions) and then try to park in
10 the adjacent neighborhood, materially impacting an already-congested street parking scenario.
11 Traffic impacts would result from hotel guests, guests of those guests, retail customers, and
12 workers (of the hotel, retail establishments and offices) as well as any of the foregoing who do

13 not want to pay whatever the not insignificant parking charge the hotel is likely to charge non-
14 employees for parking- all circling the neighborhood looking for available parking.
15 45. The City lacks the necessary substantial evidence to support a finding that the
16 Project would not result in any significant traffic impacts, and as such, cannot rely upon a Class
17 32 categorical exemption for the Project.
18 46. The Project may also result in adverse traffic impacts that prevent reliance on a
19 Class 32 exemption. Project users would be required to search for on-street parking in the
20 vicinity, resulting in traffic congestion and safety risks for pedestrians.

21 47. Transportation engineer Craig S. Neustaedter opined that the traffic analysis
22 improperly omits Keats Street, Chabela Drive, Shelley Street, Prospect Avenue and 30th Street
23 from the traffic analysis Furthermore, the KMA traffic analysis failed to analyze cumulative
24 impacts to 30th Street, which carries project traffic to and from the beach and is used by traffic
25 from the multiple large new Skechers buildings currently under construction (which would still
26 be under construction while this development is under construction) and would then be all
27 occupied impacting the area immediately proximate to this development.
28

10

1 48. KMA relies on a baseline traffic level that includes traffic from the former EI
2 Torito restaurant onsite is improper under CEQA. Normally, CEQA review requires using a
3 baseline that is consistent with the "actual environmental conditions existing at the time of
4 CEQA analysis ….. rather than the level of development or activity that could or should have
a 5 been present according to a plan or regulation." (Communities for a Better Environment v.
6 South Coast Air Quality Management Dist. (2010) 48 Cal.4th 310, 321.) The site is currently a
7 private restricted access parking lot. Its existing usage and traffic levels should be used as the

8 baseline for CEQA analysis. Contrary to these requirements, the Project's Vehicle Miles
9 Traveled (VMT) relies on a deduction for trips associated with the Project site's former use as a
10 restaurant.

11 NOISE IMPACTS PREVENT RELIANCE ON A CATEGORICAL EXEMPTION.

12 49. Substantial evidence was also submitted regarding the adverse noise impacts that
13 would result from the Project. Since the Project may result in adverse noise impacts, the City
14 may not rely on a Class 32 exemption from CEQA in approving it. Independent expert-
15 opinion analysis shows noise impacts will be significant. The Project applicant's noise analysis,
16 prepared by Michael Baker International ("MBI"), significantly understated the Project's
17 operational noise impacts in ways that include but are not limited to the following.
18 50. Condition 16 in Resolution PC 20-XX requires that noise be inaudible at the property
19 lines. (Nov. 18, 2020 Memorandum, p. 11 of 1060.) Roughly 50 feet from the west property
20 line, both the fourth-floor open-air terrace and the ground-level patio will serve alcohol to
21| hundreds of patrons until 1 AM 1 seven days a week. Twenty feet from the east property line, a
22 veritable wall of noise sources exists: 45 openable hotel-room windows, an open garage with
23 patrons talking loudly and slamming doors at 1 AM, and a rooftop crammed with chugging air-
24 conditioner compressors and whining fans. MBI did not, however, evaluate the audibility of
25 noise generated by the Project at the property line, nor did they measure nighttime ambient noise
26 levels to establish compliance with Condition #16. (Rebuttal of Testimony by Applicant's
27 Consultant MBI on 11/18/2020, Steve Rogers Acoustics LLC, December 14, 2020, p. 4)
28

11

51. MBI assumed that only one of the 25 pieces of HVAC equipment on the roof would

2 be operating at any given time. In reality, noise impacts on the nearby residential uses would be
3 the combined effect of multiple fans and condenser units operating simultaneously. (Manhattan
4 Beach Hotel: Review of the Applicant's Noise Impact Analysis ("SRA Noise Report"), Steve
5 Rogers Acoustics LLC, November 15, 2020, pp. 1, 4.) MBI assumes an unrealistically low level
6 of speech effort for each individual talker in the rooftop bar, roof terrace and hotel bar patio.
7 (SRA Noise Report, pp. 1,5.) MBI bases crowd noise impact evaluation on a single talker, a

8 whereas Mr. Rogers' analysis estimated that the rooftop bar/terrace could accommodate 200

9 people, with room for dozens more on the first-floor patio. (SRA Noise Report, pp. 1, 5.) Taking
10 into consideration the noise impacts of multiple speakers, as well as the noise analysis'
11 inadequate assumptions for speech effort and failure to factor in alcohol consumption (which
12 can increase crowd noise), the true impact of crowd noise in the outdoor gathering area of the
13 hotel would be at least 30 dBA higher than MBI predicts --i.e. a net noise level of 53 dBA,
14 which would exceed the nighttime exterior noise standard in the [Manhattan Beach Municipal
15 Code section 5.48.160]. (SRA Noise Report, p. 5.) MBI does not address potential noise
16 impacts associated with amplified music playback in the hotel, including live music
17 performances and DJ sets on the rooftop terrace. (SRA Noise Report, pp. 1, 6.) MBI does not
18 address noise impacts on the residential uses located on El Oeste Drive, to the west of the
19 project site. The homes on this street would have a direct line-of-sight to the rooftop bar/terrace,
20 approximately 300-feet away. (SRA Noise Report, p. 1.) MBI does not address the low ambient
21 noise levels during the late evening or at night on the neighboring residential streets, nor the
22 related issue of audibility of noise emanating from the hotel. Evaluation of audibility is
23 necessary to demonstrate compliance with both the Municipal Code and the MBPC Conditions
24 of Approval. (SRA Noise Report, p. 1.)

25 52. City staff notes the fact that construction activities will occur over approximately 18
26 months and that residential uses could be exposed to noise levels of approximately 91 dBA if a
27 scraper is used. With the proposed development requiring excavation down 25 feet and the
28

12

1 removal of approximately 27,000 square yards of hardscape and dirt and 2,466 tons of debris
2 (Nov. 18, 2020 Memorandum, p. 124 of 1060) to be able to install foundations for
3 100,000 square feet of buildings and subterranean parking, the use of such equipment and other
4 similarly loud noise emitting heavy machinery is unavoidable. However, staff concludes
5 construction noise impacts would be less than significant. This conclusion is unsupportable and
6 impermissibly relies on mitigation measures such a as a 6-foot concrete wall on Chabela Drive

7 and masking by traffic noise. A categorical exemption may not be used to support approval of
8 the Project.
53. Noise impacts from the ground level parking lot and the open-to-the-air
10 underground parking lot adjacent to the residential neighbors can be significant. There is no
11 wall, acoustic sealing of the underground lot or other measure to reduce the impacts of cars and
12 human activity in the parking lot.
13 54. Noise impacts from heating and air conditioning equipment on the rooftop can be
14 significant. A court explained: "There were also public comments at the hearings that the air
15 conditioners are very noisy. Citizens claims this evidence was sufficient to raise a fair argument
16 of significant noise impacts....We agree." (Citizens for Responsible & Open Government v.
17 City of Grand Terrace (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1323, 1340.)

18 55. For all of these reasons, the Project does not fit within a Class 32 categorical
19 exemption and exceptions to the exemption apply.
20 Exceptions to the Categorical Exemption Apply. -_..
21 56. Even if the Project did fit within the Class 32 exemption, the exemption would be
22 inapplicable because several exceptions to categorical exemptions apply. (CEQA Guidelines §
23 15300.2.) :
24 57. The Project would also result in cumulatively considerable impacts from multi-
25 retail and commercial projects, such as traffic and noise.
26 58. A categorical exemption is "inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive
27 projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant." (CEQA Guidelines §
28

13

1 15300.2(b).) While the Project proponent attempts to rely on the nearby Skechers' commercial

2 development project analysis, it fails to address cumulative impacts of the Skechers project and
3 others nearby. One of the mitigation measures for the Skechers project is to require a
4 lengthened left turn pocket onto Tennyson for southbound traffic. This additional left turn
5 capacity will have significant effect in adding traffic to the Tennyson segment west of
6 Chabela. In turn, additional Project generated traffic in the area creates the likelihood of
7 additional traffic accidents.

8 59. The increase in traffic accidents including fatalities could be significant. There have

9 been two recent fatal accidents right by the site of the proposed hotel. The most recent involved

10 a young mother on a bicycle. An earlier one involved : motorcyclist. ("Manhattan Beach

11 Bicyclist Killed in Car Accident, Easy Reader News (Feb. 6, 2016), available at
12 https://easyreadernews.com/manhattan-beach-bicyclist-killed-in-car-accident; "Driver In
13 Manhattan Beach Motorcycle Crash Charged With Vehicular Manslaughter," Easy Reader
14 News (Mar. 5, 2013), available at https://easyreadernews.com/driver-in-manhattan-beach-
15 motorcycle-crash-charged-with-vehicular-manslaughter.)
16 60. The real party in interest's traffic analysis references seven collisions over a five
17 year period at the Sepulveda/Tennyson junction but does not mention that at least two of those
18 were the above referenced fatalities. The analysis ignores that only two hundred yards from the
19 proposed development at the Sepulveda/Artesia junction there were 37 road traffic accidents
20 (over seven per year) in the same analyzed period in a report done for a nearby project *
21 | (Environmental Impact Report, Appendix F Traffic Impact Study, Sketchers Design Center and
22 Offices Project, August 25, 2016, p. 98.) One such accident at the Sepulveda/Artesia junction
23 a was a fatality that was reported in 2019. (https://abc7.com/hermosa-beach-crash-car-
24 deadly/5640653/.) The Tennyson/Sepulveda junction is already a dangerous intersection
25 because of the challenging sight lines, topography, and high speed of vehicles in the area. The
26 Project would contribute extensive traffic to this already dangerous intersection- both turning
27 across it and entering into it.

28

14

61. These incidents as well as the detailed accidents analysis contained in the traffic
2 report conducted as part of the EIR review conducted for the Skechers developments referenced
above demonstrates that the area of Sepulveda adjacent to the project site is unusually
4 dangerous, and that must be accounted for in a full EIR review of the impacts of the proposed
5 Project.
62. The Project would require an encroachment permit from the California Department
7 of Transportation (Caltrans) and otherwise impact Caltrans' jurisdictional state highway
8 (Sepulveda Boulevard), but Caltrans was not consulted. Such consultation is required by CEQA

9 where impacts to the state highway are likely, including public safety impacts.
10 63. A categorical exemption is further inapplicable when "there is a reasonable
11 possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual
12 circumstances." (CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2, subd. (c).) This Project is unlike the typical
13 project for which the Class 32 categorical exemption was developed due to the surrounding
14 residential neighborhood and the Municipal Code requirements to which the Project does not
15 conform. These unusual circumstances result in a reasonable possibility the Project may have a
16 significant adverse impact, preventing reliance on a categorical exemption.
17 A Categorical Exemption Cannot Be Used If Mitigation Measures are Required to Reduce
18 A Project's Impacts.
19 64. A categorical exemption for this Project is also improper because the City relied on
20 mitigation measures to approve the Project. "An agency should decide whether a project is
21 eligible for a categorical exemption as part of its preliminary review of the project without
22 reference to or reliance upon any proposed mitigation measures" (Salmon Protection &

: 23 Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1106.) Reliance on such
24 measures "involves an evaluative process ..and that process must be conducted under
25 established CEQA standards and procedures for EIRs or negative declarations." (Id. at 1108.)
26 Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th
27 1165, 1191, 1201 holds an agency may not "evade these standards by evaluating proposed
28

15

mitigation measures in connection with the significant effect exception to a categorical

2 exemption."

3 65. The Project's scale and massing and parking would not be comparable to any
4 residential project in the immediate it area and make it incompatible with adjacent residential

5 neighborhoods. The rooftop amenities also overwhelm adjacent residential uses with noise

6 impacts and aesthetic intrusion.

7 66. In a futile attempt to mitigate these impacts, the Project was conditioned upon a
8 number of modifications. The conditions of approval require development in accordance with

9 site plans that were revised to create a stepped design and attempt to camouflage the building
10 façade with foliage.

11 67. The Project would have adverse noise impacts on the surrounding residential
12 neighborhood. Conditions of approval were devised to set hours of operation for the rooftop
13 deck in an attempt to address the concerns raised regarding noise impacts. Additionally, the
14 Project was revised to additional landscaping in an attempt to address aesthetic impacts.
15 68. The conditions required by the City are extensive but likely to be ineffectual in
16 reducing the Project's significant impacts. Hours of operation, including alcohol service, are
17 allowed seven days a week from 7 a.m. to a.m. (Oct 14, 2020 Memorandum, p. 14 of 829;
18 Nov. 18, 2020 Memorandum, p. 10 of 1060 [Section 8, condition 12]); live entertainment would
19 be permitted on an outdoor terrace (Ibid. [condition 15]); conditions state "noise shall not be
20 audible beyond the premises" but there is no enforcement mechanism; parking is to be
21 "discourage[d]" on adjacent residential streets (Oct 14, 2020 Memorandum, p. 15 of 829; Nov.
22 18. 2020 Memorandum, p. 11 of 1060 [condition 34]) but there is no proof this mitigation
23 measure would be effective.

24 69. These measures are likely to be ineffective as shown by the experience of residents
25 around the Residence Inn by Marriott further north on Sepulveda Boulevard in Manhattan
26 Beach. Local newspapers reported on October 22, 2020 that the City Council had to impose
27 additional restrictions on operations at the Residence Inn because of disturbances its operations
28

16

1 were causing to neighboring residents. (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vU95mCLKkGJb-
2 nXsv8gRcY-2Y_50rPD3/view?usp=sharing.)

3 70. By definition, a project does not qualify for a categorical exemption unless the
4 agency has determined environmental impacts cannot occur and mitigation measures are
5  unnecessary.

6 71. Here, the City has imposed conditions of approval to mitigate the Project's likely
7 impacts. For this reason, the City cannot rely on a Class 32, or any other, categorical exemption

8 to CEQA review. Environmental review is required to assess the adequacy of the conditions to
9 mitigate the Project's impacts to a less than significant level.
10 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: Premature and Improper Filing of Notice of Exemption)

12 72. Petitioner incorporates by reference herein each and every allegation contained in
13 the previous paragraphs.
14 73. CEQA provides that a Notice of Exemption and other types of notices be filed with
15 the County in which the Project is located after the final approval of the Project. It is an error of
16 law and an abuse of discretion to file such notice prior to final approval of the Project. (Cal.
17 Code Regs. tit. 14 § 15062 (a) & (b).) Under the Manhattan Beach Municipal Code, the timely

18 filing of an appeal of a Master Use Permit stays the action of the Planning Commission.
19 (MBMC section 10.100.010.E and 10.84.080). Thus, the filing of a notice of exemption prior to
20 the expiration of the time to file an appeal is premature.
21 74. Here, the City prepared and filed a notice of exemption for the Project prior.to the
22 finalization of the Project approval:- MB Poets and another entity, UNITE HERE, filed appeals.
23 However, the City did not in any way indicate the prior filing of the Notice of Exemption was
24 invalid or rescinded. Therefore, because the City's action in approving the notice of exemption
25 was itself erroneous and an abuse of discretion, a writ of mandate or alternative writ of mandate
26 should issue to require the City to set aside its approval and filing of the Notice of Exemption.

27

28

17

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (VIOLATIONS OF CITY MUNICIPAL CODE)
75. Petitioner incorporates by reference herein each and every allegation contained in
4 the previous paragraphs.

5 76. Approval of the Project violates the Manhattan Beach Municipal Code (MBMC) in
6 various ways including but not limited to the following.

7 77. As described above, the Project fails to provide the amount of parking required
8 pursuant to MBMC Section 10.64.040.

9 78. As described above, the Project fails to comply with the noise ordinance pursuant to
10 MBMC sections 5.48.140 and 5.48.160. MBMC section 10.60.120 (A) incorporates the noise
11 ordinance into the zoning code by reference.

12 79. The MBMC required land use findings for a Master Use Permit required by MBMC
13 section 10.84.060 (A)(2) and (A)(4) cannot be made because the Project is not compatible with
14 its surroundings, adversely impacts its surroundings, and creates detrimental impacts to public
15 safety and welfare.
16 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

17 In each of the respects enumerated above, the City has violated its duties under law,
18 abused its discretion, failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and decided the matters
19 complained of without the support of substantial evidence.
20 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as follows:
21 1. For an alternative and peremptory Writ of Mandate, commanding the City and its
22 agencies and commissions to set aside and void any approvals for the Project and to require the
23 preparation of legally adequate environmental review before any reapproval of the Project.
24 2. For an order enjoining and/or staying the City and Real Parties in Interest from
25 taking any action to construct any portion of the Project or to develop or alter the Project site in
a 26 any way that could result in a significant adverse impact on the environment, including the
27 surrounding community, unless and until a lawful approval is obtained from City after the
28

18

1 preparation and consideration of legally adequate environmental review and compliance with
2 the requirements of the Municipal Code.

3 3. For Petitioner's costs and attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
4 section 1021.5; and

5 4. For other and further relief as the Court finds proper.
