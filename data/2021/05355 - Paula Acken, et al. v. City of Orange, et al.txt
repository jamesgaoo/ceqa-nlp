4 INTRODUCTION

5 1. Paula and Fred Acken, John and Linda Duyette, and David and Jody Schneider

6 ("Petitioners') bring this mandamus action to enforce the California Environmental Quality

7 Act ("CEQA"), the City of Orange's ("City's) General Plan, the City's Old Towne Design
8 Guidelines, and the Planning and Zoning Laws of the State of California and City. They
9 challenge the City's approval of a massive expansion of an institutional use within the low-
10

11 density residential section of the City-designated Historic District without adequate

12 consideration of its environmental, aesthetic, and planning impacts.

13 2. Real Party in Interest, the Orange County Ronald McDonald House ("RPI"), is a charitable

14 organization that provides housing for the families of critically ill children while they receive
15 medical treatment. In the City of Orange, the Ronald McDonald Foundation operates a
16 12,580 square foot multi-family residence at 383 South Batavia Street, on the western
17
boundary of the City-designated Old Towne Historic District. Because of its size, the 18
existing Ronald McDonald House has been a non-conforming building and use in an a area 19

20 designated for low-density residential uses for many years.

21 3. Due to increased demand, RPI requested permission to more than double its existing square

22 footage by 17,325 square feet ("Expansion") in the existing low-density residential district.
23 The proposed Expansion constituted an illegal expansion of a non-conforming structure and
24 use, spot zoning, and an incompatible use in an Historic District residential zone. The
25

26 proposed Expansion will permanently change the visual character and density of the Historic

27

28

-2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

District by constructing a massive multi-lot building with minimal setbacks and an

2 overwhelming street presence.

3 The proposed Expansion would have been illegal without a General Plan Amendment
("GPA"), Zone Change ("ZC"), and variance (Variance). To accommodate RPI's request,
the City approved all of the requested regulatory changes without adequate consideration of
6 their environmental impacts, compliance with local Design Guidelines, or impacts on the 7

8 surrounding community.

9 Petitioners support the goals of the Ronald McDonald House but believe the charitable

10 purposes of the Foundation can be accomplished without constructing a massive three-story

11 institutional building of some 30,000 square feet stretching across multiple lots in a low-
12 density residential area that has existed for more than a century within a designated Historic
13 District. This action seeks to set aside the City's approval to allow consideration of a more
14

15 compatible development that respects the historic character of the surrounding neighborhood

16 while implementing RPI's goals.

17 JURISDICTION

18 6. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code section 21168 and Government

19 Code section 65009, as well as Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5. The

20 Petitioners own property within the affected Historic District located within the City and
21 County of Orange.
22
PARTIES 23

24 7. Petitioners Paula and Fred Acken are residents of the City of Orange who live within the

25 designated Historic District. They own property that is directly affected by the proposed

26 Ronald McDonald House Expansion. They also enjoy and appreciate the resources of the
27

28

-3-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- designated Historic District and believe they are essential to maintaining and improving the

2 livability, diversity, sustainability, and economic vitality of the City.

3

4 8. Petitioners John and Linda Duyette are residents of the City of Orange who live within the

5 designated Historic District. They own property that is directly affected by the proposed

6 Ronald McDonald House Expansion. They also enjoy and appreciate the resources of the

7 designated Historic District and believe they are essential to maintaining and improving the

8 livability, diversity, sustainability, and economic vitality of the City.

9 9. Petitioners Schneider Family Trust and David and Jody Schneider own property within the

10

11 City of Orange located within the designated Historic District that is directly affected by the

12 proposed Ronald McDonald House Expansion. They also enjoy and appreciate the resources

13 of the designated Historic District and believe they are essential to maintaining and

14 improving the livability, diversity, sustainability, and economic vitality of the City.

15 10. Petitioners bring this petition on behalf of all others similarly situated and too numerous to be

16 named and brought before this Court as petitioners. Petitioners and their representatives

17 objected to the City's approvals of the Expansion without compliance with CEQA, the

18

19 State's PZL, and local development requirements under the City Municipal Code.

20 11. Respondent City Council is, an at all times mentioned herein was, a municipal corporation

21 organized under the laws of the State of California with land use and planning jurisdiction

22 over the Project that is the subject of this Petition. The City is required by law to comply

23 with the requirements of CEQA, the California Planning and Zoning Laws, and its own

24 Municipal Code.

25 12. Respondent City Council had sole authority to approve the GPA, ZC, and other related

26

27 approvals. Therefore, the City Council is properly sued as a Respondent in this action.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

.

- 13. Real Party in Interest Orange County Ronald McDonald House ("RPI") operates a short-term

2

3 residence for the families of critically ill children at 383 South Batavia in City and is the
Applicant for the Expansion approvals at issue in the present case.

4

5 14. Petitioners is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that RPI is a non-profit corporation

6 that is locally managed but affiliated with similar residences in other locations.

7 15. Petitioners are ignorant of the true names and capacities of respondents sued herein as Does

8 through 10, inclusive, and therefore sue said respondents by such fictitious names.

9 Petitioners will amend this Petition to set forth the true names and capacities of said Doe

10

11 respondents as soon as the same have been ascertained. Petitioners are informed and believe,

12 and thereon allege, that each of the fictitiously named respondents are responsible in some
manner for the acts alleged herein.
13

14 16. Petitioners are ignorant of the true names and capacities of real parties in interest sued herein

15 as Does 11 through 20, inclusive, and therefore sue said real parties by such fictitious names.

16 Petitioners will amend this Petition to set forth the true names and capacities of said Doe real

17 parties in interest as soon as the same have been ascertained. Petitioners are informed and

18

19 believe, and thereon allege, that each of the fictitiously named real parties in interest are

20 responsible in some manner for the acts alleged herein.

21 17. Petitioners are beneficially interested in the outcome of these proceedings and have no plain,

22 speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law to avoid irreparable harm to

23 themselves and other similarly-situated residents in the City. The City has the capacity to

24 correct its violation of law but has failed and refused to do so.

25

26

27

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 18. Petitioners exhausted their administrative remedies by appearing before the Design Review

2 Committee, Planning Commission, and City Council of City to express their concern and to

3 adopt the concerns of other commenters on the Expansion.

4

5 19. A copy of this Petition has been mailed to the California Attorney General.

6 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

7 20. City certified a Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") for the Expansion on May 11,

8 2021. Concurrently with certification of the MND, the City Council approved the related

9 GPA, ZC, and other site=specific approvals. City filed and posted a Notice of Determination

10 ("NOD") with the County of Orange on May 14, 2021.

11

12 21. This Petition was filed within thirty (days) of the date of the NOD in accordance with Public

Resources Section 21157.

13

14 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

15 22. The paragraphs below refer to and rely on information in documents that will be lodged with

16 this Court as part of the record of proceedings.

17 ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING

18 23. City has designated the Expansion site and surrounding areas as the Old Towne Historic

19

20 District (Historic District"). The Historic District is the largest collection of historic

21 buildings constructed between World Wars I and II l in the entire country and additionally

22 contains many of the original structures built in the period after the City's incorporation. In

23 addition to hundreds of historic residences that give the City's streets their distinctive

24 character, the Historic District contains commercial, industrial, and office buildings,

25

26 including the vibrant Plaza District. St. Joseph's Hospital and the Children's Hospital of

27 Orange County are located to the west of the Historic District, but do not impinge within it.

28

-6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 24. The Expansion site is located within the Historic District on Batavia Street north of its

2 intersection with La Veta Avenue. The Ronald McDonald House was originally approved

3
D for development in or about 1987 when the property was designated for multi-family

5 residential housing. Thereafter, the area was re-designated as Low-Density Residential

6 ("LDR") to protect the Historic District from incompatible changes and to maintain its
residential character. After the LDR rezoning, the Expansion site was non-conforming both

8 in size and use and could not be expanded in accordance with the applicable provisions of the

Municipal Code.

10

11 25. The Expansion site is abutted to the northwest, north, and east by parcels designated as Low-

12 Density Residential. It is abutted by Office-Professional (O-P) zoning to the south. Across

13 Batavia Street to the west, the property is zoned Public Facilities and Institutions ("PFI") and

14 consists of medical and related office uses.

15 26. The Expansion site would be the first property designated as PFI on the east side of Batavia

16 Street within the Historic District. It is an island in an area of Low-Density Residential

17 development extending to the north, northwest, and east within the Historic District. The

18

19 Expansion is substantially larger, longer (crossing multiple parcels), taller, and more

20 prominent than the surrounding development. The Expansion does not match the height or

21 front setback of surrounding properties in any direction, making it a highly prominent outlier

22 among existing development. The proposed Expansion is not similar to any development on

23 either side of Batavia Street or within the Historic District because of its three-story frontage

24 with minimal setbacks.

25 27. The Historic District is characterized primarily by Craftsman architecture. The Expansion is

26

27 described in at least one report as Colonial Revival that does not enhance the architectural

28

-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

character of surrounding development. The three-story Expansion is also at least one story

2 taller than surrounding development, most of which is no more than one or two stories tall.

3

4 28. The Expansion requires a variance to allow a reduced front yard setback, from 20 to 15 feet.

5 The non-residential development surrounding the Expansion site is set back substantially

6 farther from Batavia Street, enhancing the sense of open space, historic character, and low-

7 density development. The Expansion results in a massive multi-parcel structure set back

8 only 15 feet from Batavia Street with minimal landscaping. The three-story structure

O constructed only 15 feet back from Batavia Street will tower over adjacent development and

10

11 change the visual character of the street, in violation of the City's Historic Design

12 Guidelines. The proposed Expansion is incompatible in height and architecture with the one-

13 story residential structures located north, northwest, and west of the site. The proposed

14 Expansion is incompatible in setbacks and architecture with the non-residential structures in

15 the vicinity. In sum, the Expansion is incompatible with all surrounding development. In

16 approving the Expansion, the City cherry-picked few adjacent project elements and ignored

17 the fundamental incompatibility of the three-story multi-parcel institutional building with the

18 one-story residences and large setbacks that characterize the surrounding area.

19

20 29. The Expansion will set a precedent for construction of non-residential development at high-

21 density uses within the Historic District. Although the Expansion constitutes an expansion of

22 a non-conforming building and use, it is not compatible with surrounding uses or zoning. It

23 is a prime example of "spot zoning" adopted for the sole purpose of supporting the charitable

24 purposes of the Ronald McDonald Foundation without considering adverse impacts on

25 surrounding property owners.

26 PROJECT APPROVAL

27

28

-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

30. As approved in or about 1987, the Ronald McDonald House consists of 21 guest rooms in

2

3 12,580 square feet. It is a large three-story building set back approximately 15 feet from

South Batavia Street.

4

5 31. As approved for Expansion in 2021, the proposed Ronald McDonald House will be

6 approximately 30,000 square feet with 44 rooms, more than double the size of the existing

structure.
7

8 32. The Expansion design was rejected by the City's Design Review Committee due to its
incompatibility with the City Design Guidelines on multiple occasions in 2020.

10

11 33. The Expansion was approved by the Planning Commission by 4-1 vote in February 2021.

12 34. The Expansion was approved by the City Council by 4-1 vote on May 11, 2021. The ZC

13 Ordinance was approved on second reading on June 8, 2021.

14 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Violations of CEQA)

16 35. Petitioners incorporate all paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

17

18 36. City prepared a Mitigated Negative Declaration for the proposed Expansion, thereby finding

19 the Expansion would have no unmitigated significant adverse impacts due to adopted

mitigation measures.
2 8 The City Council found the Expansion was compatible with PFI uses

21 located across Batavia Street, despite substantial differences in setbacks, landscaping, and

22 fencing that largely shielded development on the west side of Batavia Street from public

23 view. The City Council findings did not mention the lack of any adjacent PFI uses, or the

24 critical function of Batavia Street as the boundary of the City-designated Historic District.

25

26 37. The City Council findings failed to address the incompatible architecture, minimal setbacks,

27 lack of front landscaping, and vehicular access issues. The evidence further demonstrated the

28

-9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 Expansion would be the first PFI intrusion into the Historic District, effectively establishing a

3 beachhead for future non-residential development, in violation of the City's General Plan and

4 Zoning Ordinance, and overshadowing the much smaller historic homes in surrounding

areas.

5

6

7 38. City's findings in support of the Expansion were based almost exclusively on the charitable

8 purpose of the RPI, without regard for environmental impacts or City planning requirements.

While Petitioners

LO support RPI's purposes, RPI and the Expansion are not excused from

10 compliance with CEQA due to the need for its charitable services. Under CEQA, the

11 Expansion should be designed and located SO as to avoid significant adverse impacts to

12 surrounding development, while meeting the goals of RPI. Petitioners hope to work with

13

14 City and RPI to develop a project alternative that does not have significant unmitigated
impacts on the Historic District and surrounding development.

15

16 39. City failed to make findings supported by substantial evidence that the Expansion would

17 have no unmitigated substantial adverse impact on the existing environment under CEQAs.

18 In fact, City failed to acknowledge the Expansion would have any significant adverse

19 impacts and therefore failed to consider or adopt available mitigation measures in accordance

20

21 with CEQA. Petitioners and other commenters contend there are numerous mitigation

22 measures available to reduce impacts to the Historic District and surrounding development.

23 40. Under these circumstances, City was required to prepare an environmental impact report to

24 evaluate all impacts of the Expansion and to consider whether available alternatives would

25 reduce the environmental impacts of the comparatively massive Expansion.

26 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

27 (Violations of Planning and Zoning Laws)

28

-10-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 41. Petitioners incorporate all paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

2 42. City approved a GPA and ZC to result in "spot zoning" of the Expansion site. The resulting

3 designations is an island or peninsula of PFI zoning in the Historic District, allowing totally

4 incompatible development on the subject parcels.

5 43. In approving the GPA and ZC, City failed to consider the uses, setbacks, height, fencing, and
6
landscaping of surrounding development, as required by the PZL. The existing Ronald
7
McDonald House was a non-confirming use approved prior to adoption of low-density 8

9 zoning intended to protect the Historic District from incompatible intrusions. It never

10 complied with applicable setbacks, height, or frontage. While the existing Ronald McDonald

11 House has an inadequate setback and is much larger than surrounding residences, the

12 Expansion proposed to more than double the project's frontage and, as a result, will
13 dramatically change the visual and aesthetic character of Batavia Street.
14
44. City failed to make findings supported by substantial evidence that the Expansion would 15

16 meet the requirements for adoption of a GPA, ZC, variance, or conditional use permit.

17 45. City's findings failed to demonstrate that the proposed Expansion would be compatible with

18 adjacent land use designations or existing development. The proposed Expansion will tower

19 over existing development on Batavia Street due to its height, frontage, and minimal setback.

20 46. City failed to comply with State PZL in approving a massive three-story institutional use
21 within a certified Historic District characterized by existing development with lower heights,
22
different architecture, larger setbacks, and lower-density uses. City made no findings 23

24 supported by substantial evidence that redesignation and rezoning of the Expansion site

25 complied with the requirements of the PZL.

26

27

28

-11-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

47. City abused its discretion and acted without substantial evidence by approving the Expansion

2 in violation of the PZL.

3 THIRD CASE OF ACTION

4 (Violations of Municipal Code and City Guidelines)
5 48. Petitioners incorporate all paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.
6
49. The Expansion is located with the Historic District, which is subject to adopted Historic
7

8 Design Guidelines. The City Historic Design Committee is responsible for review of

9 projects within the City-designated Historic District to determine if they are consistent with

10 the City's adopted Historic Design Guidelines.

11 50. The City's Historic Design Review Committee reviewed the Expansion on multiple

12 occasions. At each hearing, the Design Review Committee voted to require additional
13 information or to reject the Expansion as incompatible and inconsistent with the local
14
Historic Design Guidelines. Ultimately, the Committee rejected the Expansion as 15

16 inconsistent with the City's Historic Design Guidelines.

17 51. RPI made a number of cosmetic changes to the Expansion plans after Committee Review,

18 but none were sufficient to comply with the City's Historic Design Guidelines, according to

19 the City's Design Review Committee. None of the proposed changes addressed the
20 Committee's concerns about the Expansion, including its incompatibility with surrounding
21 development and intrusion into the Historic District.
22

23 52. After the Design Committee rejected RPI's Expansion plans in December 2020 as

24 incompatible with the City's Historic Design Guidelines, RPI elected not to return to the

25 Committee for additional review of project changes.

26

27

28

-12-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 53. The Final Expansion plans failed to fully address the compatibility issues raised by the

2 Design Review Committee and continued to violate the City's Historic Design Guidelines.

3

4 54. City failed to make findings supported by substantial evidence that the Expansion would

5 satisfy the City's Historic Design Guidelines. In fact, the City effectively ignored its own

6 Historic Design Guidelines and thus abused its discretion in approving the Expansion.

7 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray:

8 1. a That the Court issue judgment and a peremptory writ ordering City Respondents to set

9 aside all approvals related to the Expansion, including the GPA, ZC and related site-

10

11 specific approvals until the City conducts an adequate environmental impact process

12 under CEQA, identify and adopt feasible mitigation measures and alternatives to lessen

13 and avoid environmental impacts, and make all findings required by CEQA, supported by

14 substantial evidence;

2.
15 That the Court issue judgment and a peremptory writ ordering City Respondents to set

16 aside all approvals related to the Expansion, including the GPA, ZC and related site-

18

19 Expansion approvals satisfy the requirements of the State Planning and Zoning Laws and

20 comply with City General Plan, its Zoning Ordinance and other regulations, and

requirements;
21

22 3. That the Court issue judgment and a peremptory writ ordering the City Respondents to set

23 aside all approvals related to the Expansion, including any findings related to compliance

24 with City Design Guidelines, until the City makes findings supported by substantial

Guidelines;

INSTRÚCTIONS ON HOW TO COMPLETE THE COVER SHEET CM-010
To Plaintiffs and Others Filing First Papers. If you are filing a first paper (for example, a complaint) in a civil case, you must complete and file, along with your first paper, the Civil Case Cover Sheet contained on page 1. This information will be used to compile to statistics about the types and numbers of cases filed. You must complete items 1 through 6 on the sheet. In item 1, you must check one box for the case type that best describes the case. If the case fits both a general and a more specific type of case listed in item 1, check the more specific one. If the case has multiple causes of action, check the box that best indicates the primary cause of action. To assist you in completing the sheet, examples of the cases that belong under each case type 1 in item 1 are provided below. A cover sheet must be filed only with your to initial paper. Failure to file a cover sheet with the first paper filed in a civil case may subject a party, its counsel, or both to sanctions under rules 2.30 and 3.220 of the California Rules of Court. To Parties in Rule 3.740 Collections Cases. A "collections case" under rule 3.740 is defined as an action for recovery of money owed in a sum stated to be certain that is not more than $25,000, exclusive of interest and attorney's fees, arising from a transaction in which property, services, or money was acquired on credit. A collections case does not include an action seeking the following: (1) tort damages, (2) punitive damages, (3) recovery of real property, (4) recovery of personal property, or (5) a prejudgment writ of attachment. The identification of a case as a rule 3.740 collections case on this form means that it will be exempt from the general time-for-service requirements and case management rules, unless a defendant files a responsive pleading. A rule 3.740 collections case will be subject to the requirements for service and obtaining a judgment in rule 3.740. To Parties in Complex Cases. In complex cases only, parties must also use the Civil Case Cover Sheet to designate whether the case is complex. If a plaintiff believes the case is complex under rule 3.400 of the California Rules of Court, this must be indicated by completing the appropriate boxes in items 1 and 2. If a plaintiff designates a case as complex, the cover sheet must be served with the complaint on all parties to the action. A defendant may file and serve no later than the time of its first appearance a joinder in the plaintiff's designation, a counter-designation that the case is not complex, or, if the plaintiff has made no designation, designation that the case is complex.
