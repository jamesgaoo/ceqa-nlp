Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

I I. INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner TEHACHAPI-CUMMINGS COUNTY WATER DISTRICT

3 a (*District") is a county water district organized and existing under the California County Water
District Law, Division 12 (commencing with § 30000) of the Water Code and the court-appointed

5 Watermaster for three adjudicated groundwater basins within its service area, Tehachapi Basin,

6 Bite Basin and Cummings Basin. As a county water district, the District supplies imported State

7 Water Project ("SWP") water to a variety of municipal, agricultural and industrial customers

8 within its service area, including the Respondent CITY OF TEHACHAPI ("City") located within

9 the Tehachapi Basin, As the court appointed Watermaster, the District is responsible for

10 administering the Tehachapi Basin Judgment, monitoring groundwater levels to ensure a stable,

11 reliable, and safe supply of groundwater to stakeholders within the Basin. In light of the District's

12 mission, regional responsibilities, and key role in relation to the City's public water system, state

13 law expects the City to coordinate closely with the District regarding large development proposals

14 to ensure informed decision-making, with adequate consideration of water resources and water

15 supply, water supply impacts, and mitigation for those impacts. As discussed below, the City

16 failed to do so.

17 2. The City approved a large scale 138-acre development including nearly 1,000

18 residential units known as Sage Ranch Development Project ("Sage Ranch" or "Sage Ranch

19 project") without engaging the District in any meaningful way. Land use decisions are the City's

20 to make, and the District takes no position as to the merits of Sage Ranch. But, the District is

21 concerned about the impacts Sage Ranch will have on the limited water supplies within the

22 District and the Basin, and those who currently depend on those limited supplies. The City
23 approved the Sage Ranch project without an adequate water supply and without first meeting its

24 obligation to inform itself, as well as other governmental agencies and the public generally, of the

25 environmental impacts of the Sage Ranch project.

26 3. The District brings this action because the City has made, and continues to make,

27 land use decisions of significant local and regional importance without accounting for a water
28 supply and the resulting project impacts on the environment, including the water supply of others.
00057004.1 2

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

I 4. Whether to approve or disapprove projects that will attract thousands of new

2 residents, with attendant water supply impacts among other environmental consequences, are

3 decisions the City cannot properly make unless and until it has complied with state law by

4 acknowledging all significant environmental impacts of proposed new development and requiring

5 feasible mitigation to address those adverse environmental consequences.

6 5. As the City's surface water supplier and Watermaster for the Tehachapi Basin, the

7 District has a legal duty and public trust responsibility to ensure that the water resources within its

8 jurisdiction are allocated in accordance with state law and local policy. Particularly since

9 California's communities are suffering from the devastating effects of a historic drought, it is

10 imperative that California's public agencies act responsibly to ensure that their actions address

11 environmental consequences and protect water resources. The City, in reviewing and approving

12 land uses and development projects, including Sage Ranch, failed to meet these mandates.

13 Indeed, the City has publicly asserted that it need not concern itself with local water supply issues
14 because it overlies the regional resources of the Tehachapi Basin and therefore is, in its view,

15 "drought proof." (https://www.tehachapinews.com/news/city-council-acts-on-sage-ranch-cell-

16 tower-signs-and-granny-units/article 8a85302c-1351-11ec-9cca-

18 KZnPUFwy3D0g ["[a]s to the local water supply," the City Development Services Director said

19 there is "350,000 acre-feet of water under the city right now. I'd go so far as to call it drought-

20 proof because of management"].) These representations are false and demonstrate a fundamental

21 misunderstanding of water supply issues, including over-estimating the amount of water available

22 in the basin by 90,000 acre-feet.

23 6. Because the City has not complied with its mandatory and public duties under the

24 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), the Water Code, the Government Code, or its

25 own policies before making decisions to approve expansive growth, the District brings this action

26 to enforce the City's obligations under applicable state and local laws, policies, ordinances, and

27 regulations. The issues in this action are issues of public right and the object of the action is to

28 enforce public duties to protect the public interest.

Il. PARTIES

2 7, Petitioner TEHACHAPI-CUMMINGS COUNTY WATER DISTRICT is a public

3 entity and legal subdivision of the State of California formed and existing pursuant to the County
4 Water District Law (Wat. Code, § 30000 et seq.) to provide an imported water supply, water

5 resource management, and flood control protection to the agricultural, municipal, and industrial

6 customers within the District's boundaries. The District is located in the Tehachapi Mountains,

7 enst of the southern San Joaquin Valley in the County of Kern and encompasses approximately

8 266,000 acres. The District brings this action on behalf of itself and in the interests of the

9 individuals, communities, and agricultural lands it serves who are adversely affected by the City's

10 actions in approving the Sage Ranch project and engaging in a pattern and practice of violation of

11 applicable laws, including inadequate environmental review of Sage Ranch pursuant to CBQA,

12 the Water Code, and the Government Code.

13 8. Respondent CITY OF TEHACHAPI is a political and geographical subdivision of

14 the State of California with its principal offices located in Kern County, California. As lead

15 agency for the Sage Ranch project and the local agency responsible for land use decisions within

16 its boundaries, the City has the discretion to approve, disapprove, or condition development
17 projects, including the Sage Ranch project, to avoid or substantially lessen, to the extent feasible,

18 the environmental harm the projects will cause, and is responsible for compliance with the

19 requirements of CEQA, the Water Code, and the Government Code before approving such
20 projects. The City is responsible for the acts described in this petition and complaint.

21 9. Public Resources Code section 21152 requires the City, in filing a "Notice of
22 Determination" for an approved project, to identify the project applicant/recipient of the project

23 approval for purposes of identifying the real parties in interest. (Sec Pub. Resources Code, §

24 21167.6.5.) The City's Notice of Determination for the Sage Ranch project filed with the Clerk

25 of Kern County failed to comply with this requirement and instead identified the "City of

26 Tehachapi" as the Project Applicant.

27 10. The District is informed and believes and, on that basis, alleges that Real Party in

28 Interest GREENBRIAR CAPITAL CORPORATION is corporation organized under the laws of
00057004.1 4

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 British Columbia with its office and/or principal place of business in Vancouver, British

2 Columbia, and is reflected in the City's record of proceedings as the Sage Ranch project applicant

3 and/or developer and/or owner of the real property that is the subject of the Sage Ranch project

4 approvals.

5 11. The District is informed and believes and, on that basis, alleges that Real Party in

6 Interest GREENBRIAR CAPITAL HOLDCO, INC. is a corporation organized under the laws of

7 Delaware with its office and/or principal place of business in Orange County, California, and is

8 reflected in the City's record of proceedings as the Sage Ranch project applicant and/or developer
and/or owner of the real property that is the subject of the Sage Ranch project approvals.

10 12, The District is informed and believes and, on that basis, alleges that Real Party in
11 Interest GREENBRIAR CAPITAL (U.S.), LLC, is a limited liability company organized under

12 the laws of Delaware with its office and/or principal place of business in Orange County,

13 California, and is reflected in the City's record of proceedings as the Sage Ranch project

14 applicant and/or developer and/or owner of the real property that is the subject of the Sage Ranch
15 project approvals.

16 13. The District is informed and believes and, on that basis, alleges that Real Party in
17 Interest JEFFREY CIACHURSKI ("Ciachurski") is an individual residing in the State of

18 California and the CEO of various real party GREENBRIAR entities, and is reflected in the

19 City's record of procecdings as the Sage Ranch project applicant and/or developer and/or owner

20 of the real property that is the subject of the Sage Ranch project approvals.

21 14. The District is currently unaware of the true names and capacities of DOES

22 through 40, inclusive, and therefore sues those parties by such fictitious names. DOES 1 through
23 40, inclusive, are those persons or entities who are responsible in some manner for the conduct in

24 this petition and complaint, or other persons or entities presently unknown to the District who

25 claim some legal or equitable interest in the project that is the subject of this action. The District

26 will amend this petition and complaint, with leave of court if necessary, to show the true names

27 and capacities of DOES 1 through 40 when such names and capacities become known.

HII. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 15. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

3 sections 525 et seq., 1060, 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and

4 21168.5.

5 16. This action is properly filed in Kern County Superior Court pursuant to Code of

6 Civil Procedure sections 394 and 395, because the Sage Ranch project is located in the County of

7 Kern, which is the City's principal place of business. The District reserves the right to seek

8 transfer of this action to a neutral county under Code of Civil Procedure section 394.
9 IV. STANDING

10 17. The basic purposes of CEQA are summarized in section 15002 of the CEQA

11 Guidelines and include the following:

12 a. Inform governmental decision-makers and the public about the potential

13 significant environmental effects of proposed activities.

14 b. Identify ways that environmental damage can be avoided Or significantly

15 reduced.

16 C Prevent significant, avoidable damage to the environment by requiring

17 changes in projects through the use of alternatives or mitigation measures when the governmental

18 agency finds the changes to be feasible.

19 d. Disclose to the public the reasons why a governmental agency approved

20 the project in the manner the agency chose if significant environmental effects are involved.

21 18. The District seeks to promote and enforce the aforementioned CEQA purposes.

22 Ascertaining the true facts about the environmental impacts of projects and informing and

23 disclosing those true facts to decision-makers and the public are purposes that are within the zone

24 of interests CEQA is intended to preserve and protect.

25 19. The District provides water supplies to the City and other communities in the
26 region, including in the vicinity of the Sage Ranch project, who will be directly and substantially
27 affected by the environmental impacts of the City's determinations regarding new land uses and

28 development projects such as the Sage Ranch project, which include but are not limited to
00057004.1 6

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 significant impacts on water supply. The District and the communities it serves have a direct

2 interest in ensuring that the City fulfills its obligations under CEQA, the Water Code, the

3 Government Code, and all other applicable laws in formulating, reviewing, approving, and
4 implementing development projects, including Sage Ranch.

5 20. The District's water supply functions and the water supplies of the individuals,

6 communities, and agricultural lands it serves will be directly and adversely affected by the City's

7 actions in certifying the Sage Ranch Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") and approving its

8 Water Supply Assessment ("WSA"), failing to condition project approval on a water supply

9 verification as required by SB 221, and implementing the Sage Ranch project without accurate

10 and adequate water supply information. Broad and long-term adverse environmental

11 consequences are involved when public agencies such as the City fail to adequately review and

12 condition projects in their jurisdiction, including projects of regional and areawide significance
13 such as Sage Ranch, to ensure adequate water supply.

14 21. The City has a mandatory and public duty to comply with CEQA, the Water Code,

15 the Government Code, and all other applicable laws when reviewing and approving development

16 projects. The issues in this action are issues of public right and the object of the action is to

17 enforce public duties to protect the public interest.

18 22. The District brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of

19 Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable theory in law or equity to enforce
20 important public rights affecting the public interest.

21 V. EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

22 23, The District has performed or is excused from performing any and all conditions

23 precedent to the filing of this action and has exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the

24 extent required by law, including as required by Public Resources Code section 21177.

25 24. The District presented its specific objections to the City's review of the Sage

26 Ranch project, to its EIR and WSA, and to its approval of the project in written comments and at

27 the City's public hearings. All issues raised in this action were raised to the City by the District,

28 other public agencies, organizations, or members of the public prior to the City's approval of the
00057004.1 7

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 Sage Ranch project and its certification of the Sage Ranch EIR.

2 25, The District has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of

3 law. Unless the Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require the City to set aside its

4 approval of the Sage Ranch project, including certification of the EIR and approval of the WSA

5 and tentative map, and to evaluate those decisions in a manner that properly accounts for water

6 supply and other impacts, the City's decisions will remain in effect in violation of state law.

D 26. This action is timely filed within 30 days of the County Clerk's posting of the
8 City's eNotice of Determination" for the Sage Ranch project on August 19, 2021, in accordance

9 with Public Resources Code section 21167.

10 27. Pursuant to Government Code section 905(i), this action is not subject to the

11 Government Claims Act.

12 VI. NOTICE OF PROCEEDING

13 28. The District has complied with Public Resources Code section 21 167.5 by prior
14 service of notice to the City indicating the District's intent to commence this action. A copy of

15 the notice is attached as Exhibit A hereto and incorporated herein by this reference.

16 29. The District elects to prepare the record of proceedings under Public Resources

17 Code section 21167.6(b)(2), pursuant to the election filed concurrently herewith.

18 30. The District will provide notice of this action to the Attorney General of the State

19 of California by serving a copy of this Petition along with a notice of its filing, as required by
20 Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and California Code of Civil Procedure section 388.

21 VII. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

22 A. Background

23 31. The District was formed in 1965 under the provisions of the County Water District
24 Law (Wat. Code, § 30000 et seq.) to provide an imported water supply, water resource

25 management, and limited flood control protection to the agricultural, municipal, and industrial

26 customers within the District's boundaries, which encompass approximately 266,000 acres.

27 There are three adjacent, but hydrologically separate, adjudicated groundwater basins within the

28 District - Brite, Cummings, and Tehachapi. Brite Basin has a Native Safe Yield ("NSY") of 500
00057004.1 8

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 acre-feet per year ("AFY"). Cummings Basin has a NSY of 2,990 AFY. Tehachapi Basin has a

2 NSY of 5,500 AFY.

3 32. The City is located in the Tehachapi Basin. Water rights holders within Tehachapi
Basin are assigned "Base Water Rights" but only allowed to pump 2/3rds of their base rights as a

5 "Pumping Allocation." The sum of total annual Pumping Allocations is approximately equivalent

6 to the Native Safe Yield of 5,500 AFY.

7 33. The District performs all recharge and recovery projects for the basins, and: (1)

8 protects groundwater resources within the basins by administering judgments; (2) acts as the

9 agent for any water right ownership change; and (3) provides annual reports to the Kern County

10 Superior Court, in accordance with the Cummings and Tehachapi basin judgments. The District

11 is charged with carrying out its Watermaster duties, powers, and responsibilities in an impartial

12 manner without favor or prejudice to any party and is accountable to the Kern County Superior

13 Court as to the water supply under its management. (See Antelope Valley Groundwater Cases

14 (2021) 62 Cal.App.Sth 992, 1053.)

15 34. The District has a limited surface water supply that is constrained by host of

16 factors outside the District's control. The District has two SWP water supply contracts with the

17 Kern County Water Agency ("KCWA") for a total entitlement of 19,300 AFY. The KCWA in

18 turn has a water supply contract with the California Department of Water Resources ('DWR").
19 The difference between SWP entitlement and allocation is well documented. There exists "a

20 huge gap between what is promised and what can be delivered," rendering State Water Project

21 entitlements nothing more than "hopes, expectations, water futures or, as the parties refer to them,

22 'paper water."* (Planning & Conservation League v. Department of Water Resources (2000) 83

23 Cal.App.4th 892, 908, fn. 5.) Over the past 20 years, DWR has dramatically reduced the amount

24 of SWP water it delivers through the KCWA to the District, to the point where today, the District

25 can expect to receive only about 40 percent of its contractual water supply from the SWP in an

26 average water year. In fact, over the last 10 years, the District has imported an average ofless

27 than 39 percent of its contractual water supply from the SWP. With the current demands of

28 existing customers of over 9,000 AFY, the system retains less than 1,000 AFY of expansion
00057004.1

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 capacity.

2 35. The City of Tehachapi is just one of the District's customers that uses water

3 supplied by the District to serve its residents. The terms of that supply are governed by a contract
t known as a "Term M&I Agreement."

5 36. On January 1, 2017, the District and the City entered into a new a Term Municipal
6 & Industrial ("M&I'*) Agreement ("Agreement") that provided for a ten-year term that

7 automatically renews on an annual basis for one additional year, unless either party provides

8 notice that the Agreement will not be extended. One purpose of the ten-year term was to ensure

9 the Agreement could not be relied upon as a long-term water supply due to the variable nature of

10 the District's water resources. The District cannot reliably meet a fixed water demand for

11 residential development with a variable imported water supply. In order to supplement available

12 supply in periods of shortage, the Agreement requires that a five-year supply of imported water

13 supply (based on a five-year rolling average) be recharged by the District and credited to the

14 Banked Water Reserve Account of the City. This requirement is common to all of the District's

15 Term M&I Agreements.

16 37. In years when the District does not anticipate that the available supply of imported

17 SWP water will be sufficient to meet its customers' demands, the District adopts a Water Priority

18 Ordinance establishing delivery priorities. Ordinance 2021-1 was adopted by the District's Board

19 of Directors on April 21, 2021. The ordinance provides that the District's existing M&I water
20 users bave the highest priority for available water supplies (after fire protection). The District has

21 consistently prioritized deliveries in this manner. New City connections, including new

22 connections for the Sage Ranch project, are not existing water users and therefore would have no

23 priority.

24 B, Sage Ranch Project Details

25 38. The Sage Ranch project has the stated goal to "provide a variety of housing

26 opportunities with a range of densities, styles, sizes, and values that will be designed to satisfy
27 existing and future demand for quality housing in the area." (Draft EIR, p. 2-10.) It is a 138-acre

28 master planned community totaling 995 residential units expected to be built in phases over a

00057004.1 10

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 period of seven years, and accordingly has the potential to bring substantial growth to the City.

2 39. The Sage Ranch WSA and Updated WSA assume that the District will receive an

3 average of 60% of its contracted SWP entitlement. It states that the "City anticipates that

4 sufficient supplies will be reasonable available for purchase from the [District] and will have been

5 previously recharged for recovery during the average, single dry, and multiple dry years." There

6 is no evidence in the record supporting this assumption and the City has not asked the District for

7 its projections of available supply and recharge capacity. As described more fully below, the

8 District will not have sufficient water available to provide the necessary 1,560.5 acre-feet per year

9 for the City and meet the requirements of the District's other existing customers,

10 40, Sage Ranch, and future City growth, rely almost exclusively on the District for

11 water supply. While the M&I Agreement requires the City to buy water, the District is only

12 required to sell the City 5 acre-feet of water annually. Any additional supply that the District

13 makes available is expressly conditioned upon the availability of sufficient SWP water to enable

14 the District to meet its customers' water demands. In addition to the City, the District has Term

15 M&I agreements with a number of other customers, including three public water purveyors: (1)

16 Golden Hills Community Services District; (2) Bear Valley Community Services District; and (3)

17 Stallion Springs Community Services District existing inaster-planned communities that also

18 have significant numbers of entitled but undeveloped lots that will further decrease the District's

19 available imported water supply. Additionally, the District supplies water to California

20 Correctional Institution at Tehachapi, a California state prison located within the corporate limits

21 of the City of Tehachapi, under a separate Term M&I Agreement.

22 41. In its review of land use proposals such as Sage Ranch, the City has made no

23 account of the fact that SWP reservoir storage is at an all-time low, and even a 40% average

24 annual SWP allocation (rather than the City's demonstrably unrealistic 60%) may be optimistic

25 given the increasingly difficult drought conditions placing ever-growing strains on the State's,

26 and thus the District's, water resources.

27 42. Further restricting the District's ability to meet water demands is the fact that its

28 pumping capacity is limited to a maximum of 10,000 AFY. The District takes SWP water from
00057004.1 11

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 the Aqueduct on the San Joaquin Valley floor, and through a series of enormous pumps, lifts the

2 water about 3,500 feet into the Tehachapi Mountains. In a problem-free year the District can

3 pump a maximum 10,000 AF. Thus, even though the District's SWP contract entitlement is
4 19,300 AFY, the District cannot import more than 51.8% (10,000/19,300) of its full entitlement in

5 a given year. Therefore, any water supply analysis must take into account not only SWP
6 reliability, but the physical limitation restricting the District's ability to pump imported water in

7 years when SWP allocation exceeds 51.8%. When SWP allocations are adjusted to factor in

8 system capacity, actual SWP deliveries into the District are reduced to 33.2% on a 10-year

9 average and 37.5% on a 15-year average. For these reasons, the City's assumption that the

10 District will receive an average of 60% of its contracted SWP entitlement not only is unsupported

11 by substantial evidence, it is clearly erroneous. Present demand, including recharge and other

12 banking commitments, exceeds 9,000 AFY. Thus, even in a year when the District receives a full

13 10,000 AF allocation, the District's available surplus is limited is to about 1,000 AFY combined for

14 all customers (not exclusively the City).

15 43. As expressed during the City's administrative process, as now, the District takes

16 no position on the merits of the Sage Ranch project. The District is largely responsible for

17 managing the area's water resources, however, and is concerned that to date, the City's review of

18 the Sage Ranch project fails to account for the need to sustainably manage water resources when

19 attempting to plan for future growth in a responsible manner. (See Pub. Resources Code, §

20 21151.9, Wat. Code, § 10910; Gov. Code, § 66473.7.) To do so, the City's documents must be

21 as accurate, factual, and realistic as possible. After reviewing the Sage Ranch EIR and WSA that

22 purported to analyze the project's environmental impacts, particularly its impacts on water

23 resources, the District concluded that the City has failed to minimally meet these standards.

24 C. CEQA Process

25 44. The District is informed and believes and, on that basis, alleges that in or about
26 July 2019 thc City submitted a Notice of Preparation of a Draft EIR for the Sage Ranch project to
27 the Governor's Office of Planning & Research ("State Clearinghouse"), which received the notice

28 on July 1,2019. The Notice of Preparation did not give notice that any scoping mecting would be
00057004.1 12

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

-

2 held for the Sage Ranch project, despite the fact that the Sage Ranch project is, by definition, one

3 of regional and/or areawide significance under CEQA (see CEQA Guidelines section 15206

4 explaining that a proposed residential development of more than 500 dwelling units is a project of

5 statewide, regional, or areawide significance) and the City therefore was required to conduct at

6 least one scoping meeting to present information about the project to other public agencies such

7 as the District and receive input regarding the appropriate scope of the environmental analysis.

8 (CEQA Guidelines, §g 15206(b), 15082(c)(1) and (c)(2).) Specifically, the City was required to

9 conduct at least one scoping meeting and provide notice of the scoping meeting to all of the

10 following: (A) any county or city that borders on a county or city within which the project is

11 located, unless otherwise designated annually by agreement between the lead agency and the

12 county or city; (B) any responsible agency; (C) any public agency that has jurisdiction by law

13 with respect to the project; (D) any organization or individual who has filed a written request for
the notice. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15082(c)(2).)

14 45.

15 The District is informed and believes and, on that basis, alleges that the City

16 violated mandatory CEQA procedures by failing to conduct at least one public scoping meeting

17 for the Sage Ranch project, thus failing to proceed in the manner required by law and
prejudicially abusing its discretion.

18 46.

19 The District is informed and believes and, on that basis, alleges that in or about

20 March 2020, the City submitted a Notice of Completion and Environmental Document

21 Transmittal for the Sage Ranch Draft EIR to the State Clearinghouse, which received the notice
on March 4, 2020.

22 47. The District submitted a comment letter on the Draft EIR

23

24 2020, which the City purported to respond to in its Final EIR. to the City on April 17,

48.

25 Prior to the City's certification of the EIR and approval of the Sage Ranch project,

26 the District submitted further written comments, including but not limited to detailed comments

27 regarding the inaccurate and insufficient information in the City's EIR and WSA, on July 28,

28 2021, and appeared at the City Council hearing on the Sage Ranch project on August 16, 2021, to
submit further comments. At that same hearing, the City Council certified the Sage Ranch BIR
00057004.1 13
Petition for Writ of Mandatc aud Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 and approved the project.

2 49. The City filed a Notice of Determination with Kern County, which was received

3 by the County Clerk on August 18, 2021, and posted on August 19, 2021. A copy of the Notice

4 of Determination is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

5 VIII, CLAIMS FOR RELIEF

6 A. First Cause of Action - CEQA Violations

7 50. The District hereby realleges and incorporates by reference each and every

8 allegation set forth above, inclusive.

9 51. CEQA requires an agency to analyze the potential environmental impacts of its

10 proposed actions in an EIR, except in certain limited circumstances. The EIR is the very heart of

11 CEQA, and "the 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act

12 to be read so as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable

13 scope of the statutory language." (Communities for a Better Environment v. California Resources

14 Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.) The purpose of an EIR is to provide public agencies

15 and the public in general with detailed information about the likely effects of a proposed project
16 on the environment. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21061.) An EIR must fully analyze and disclose
17 all of the project's potentially significant environmental effects. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21100,

18 subd. (b)(1).) To be considered adequate, an EIR must, at a minimum, provide a sufficient degree
19 of analysis and information to enable decision-makers to take action that intelligently accounts for

20 environmental consequences. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15151.)

21 52. For the following reasons, and each of them, the City prejudicially abused its

22 discretion, acted in excess of its jurisdiction, and failed to proceed in the manner required by law
23 in its review and approval of the Sage Ranch project. (Pub. Resources Code, $§ 21168, 21168.5.)
24 Failure to Conduct at Least one Public Scoping Meeting

25 53. CEQA requires the lead agency preparing an EIR for a project of statewide,
26 regional, or areawide significance to conduct at least one scoping meeting and to provide notice

27 of the scoping meeting to all of the following: (A) any county or city that borders on a county or

28 city within which the project is located, unless otherwise designated annually by agreement
00057004.1 14

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 between the lead agency and the county or city; (B) any responsible agency; (C) any public

2 agency that has jurisdiction by law with respect to the project; (D) any organization or individual

3 who has filed a written request for the notice. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15082(c)(2).)

4 54. The City's Notice of Preparation for the Sage Ranch project EIR did not give.

5 notice that aby scoping meeting would be held, despite the fact that the Sage Ranch project is, by

6 definition, one of regional and/or areawide significance under CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, §

7 15206 [a proposed residential development of more than 500 dwelling units is a project of

8 statewide, regional, or areawide significance].) The City therefore was required to conduct at least

9 one scoping meeting to present information about the project to other public agencies such as the

10 District and receive input regarding the appropriate scope of the environmental analysis, yet
11 failed to do so. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15206(b), 15082(c)(1) and (c)(2).)

12 55. The City therefore violated mandatory CEQA procedures by failing to conduct at

13 least one public scoping meeting for the Sage Ranch project, thus failing to proceed in the manner
14 required by law and prejudicially abusing its discretion.

15 Failure to Adequately and Accurately Describe the Project and Its Setting

16 56. Under CEQA, the EIR must include a description of the proposed project that
17 includes, among other things:

18 A general description of the project's technical, economic, and
19 environmental characteristics, considering the principal engineering proposals if any and supporting public service
20 facilities.

21 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15124(c).)

22 57. The project description must be accurate and complete in order to determine the

23 proper scope of environmental review:

24 Only through an accurate view of the project may affected outsiders and public decision-makers balance the proposal's
25 benefit against its environmental cost, consider mitigation measures, assess the advantage of terminating the proposal (i.e.,
26 the "No Project" alternative) and weigh other alternatives in the balance. An accurate, stable and finite project description is the
27 sine qua non of an informative and legally sufficient EIR.

28 (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 192-193.)

00057004.1 15

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 58. The accuracy of an EIR's description of the proposed project and its

2 environmental setting are closely linked to the adequacy of the EIR's analysis of the project's

3 environmental effects. (Ibid.; San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center v. County of Stanislaus

4 (1994) 27 Cal.App.3d 713, 722-723; see also CEQA Guidelines, § 15125(a) [a brief but accurate

5 description of the project's environmental setting is necessary to provide an understanding of the

6 significant effects of the proposed project and its alternatives].) The project description sets forth

7 the analytical foundation for the entire EIR; as such, an accurate, well-conceived, stable and finite

8 project description is essential. (County of Inyo, supra, 71 Cal.App.3d at pp. 192-193.)

9 59. In this case, however, the EIR's description of the Sage Ranch project and its

10 environmental setting are incomplete, inaccurate, and misleading. (Draft EIR, pp. 3.10-1 - 3.10-

11 20; Final EIR, pp. 3.19-1 - 3.19-30.) The EIR acknowledges that the District is the main source

12 of water to supply the project. (Draft EIR, pp. 3.10-1, 3.19-1; Final EIR, p. 3.10-22-25, 3.19-1.)

13 The EIR and WSA misrepresent the nature of this supply in a host of ways, not the least of which

14 is the following statement in the Final EIR:

15 Governed by the City/TCCWD Term M&I Agreement (See

16 Attachment C of the WSA), TCCWD has agreed to provide State Water Project water to the City of Tehachapi in perpetuity.
17 (Final EIR, p. 3.10-25; see also Updated WSA, July 2021, p. 21.)

18 60. This statement, quoted from page 3.10-25 of the Final EIR, is directly contrary to

19 the Term M&I Agreement. First, the City's contract with the District does not prioritize new

20 municipal water users above existing legal water users in the District. Second, the Term M&I

21 Agreement does not assure water service to the City of Tehachapi "in perpetuity" as alleged in the

22 EIR and WSA. Rather, the Term M&I Agreement has a 10-year term that automatically renews
23 on an annual basis for one additional year, unless either party provides notice that the Agreement

24 will not be extended. Specifically, the Term M&I Agreement states:
25 11. This agreement shall have a term ending December 31,
26 2026; provided, however, that each year on the anniversary date of this agreement, this agreement shall extend one additional year,
27 unless, at least 90 days prior to such anniversary date either party provides notice to the other that it will not consent to such further
28 extension(s) of this agreement and further provided, however, this
00057004.1 16

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 agreement shall terminate upon termination of the KCWA
WATER SUPPLY CONTRACTS (December 31, 2039) unless and 2 to the extent the terms of such agreements are extended.
3 The District therefore has the right to terminate the agreement at any time, and as the City is
y aware, a purpose of the 10-year term was to prevent the City's reliance on the Term M&I
5 Agreement as a long-term water supply.

6 61, Even if the City's contract for District water service were a perpetual agreement,
7 the days of a simple "will-serve" letter to address the intersection of land use and water supply are
8 over. (See Pub. Regources Code, § 21151.9; Wat. Code, § 10910; Gov. Code, § 66473.7.) Under
9 state law, the City must coordinate with the District to accurately describe the Sage Ranch
10 project's environmental setting, to determine whether adequate water supplies exist to serve the
11 proposed project, and to support that determination through rigorous and detailed
12 documentation - but the City failed to do so. (See, e.g., Preserve Wild Santee v. City of Santee
13 (2012) 210 Cal.App.4th 260, 282-286.)
14 62. The EIR further fails to account for variable hydrology or the rapidly changing
15 circumstances affecting water supply in the state. Without an accurate description of the project
16 or its environmental setting, an EIR cannot achieve the foremost objective of CEQA, that is, the
17 analysis, disclosure, and mitigation of project-related impacts on the environment. (CEQA
18 Guidelines, $§ 15002, 15125.)
19 63. CEQA also requires the City's EIR to discuss inconsistencies between the
20 proposed project and regional plans, such as the Greater Tehachapi Arca Regional Urban Water
21 Management Plan ("RUWMP"). (CEQA Guidelines, § 15125, subd. (d).) The Sage Ranch
22 project is not contemplated in, and substantially conflicts with, the planning and management
23 measures in the RUWMP. The City's actions violate CEQA because they are based on an EIR
24 that fails to disclose the project's inconsistencies with applicable plans.
25 64. The City, by certifying the EIR and approving the Sage Ranch project despite
26 these violations of CEQA and the Water Code, prejudicially abused its discretion.

00057004.1 17

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 Failure to Adequately Analyze the Project's Incremental and Cumulative Impacts Related

2 to Water Resources, Water Supply, and Public Utilities

3 65. An EIR must provide the public and the decision maker with adequate information
4 to fully assess the direct, reasonably foreseeable indirect, and cumulative impacts of a proposed

5 action. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15064(d), 15126.2(a), 15130, 15355, 15358; Citizens of Goleta

6 Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.) An EIR must "avoid minimizing"

7 impacts and "must reflect a conscientious effort to provide .  adequate and relevant detailed

8 information about them." (San Franciscans for Reasonable Growth v. City and County of San

9 Francisco (1984) 151 Cal.App.3d 61, 79.) An agency violates CEQA if its decision is reached

10 without individual consideration and balancing of environmental factors, fully and in good faith.
11 "[FJailure to provide enough information to permit informed decision-making is fatal." (Napa
12 Citizens for Honest Government v. Napa County Board of Supervisors (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th
13 342, 361.)

14 66. The courts have instructed that special care must be taken to properly assess

15 strained resources such as limited surface water or groundwater supplies before committing to
16 projects that rely on such water. The California Supreme Court's opinion in Vineyard Area

17 Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. V. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 432,
18 summarizes the applicable principles and requirements governing water supply analysis and water
19 supply mitigation. While the Court recognized the element of uncertainty in evaluating long-term
20 water supply for proposed development, it emphasized that CEQA requires a rigorous

21 examination of water supply at all stages, and planning for that supply prior to approving the
22 development. The City's EIR and WSA fall far short of these requirements. The record
23 demonstrates that the Sage Ranch project's water supply, to the extent it even has been identified,

24 in both the short-term and long-term, is inadequate.

25 67. To minimally comply with CEQA, the EIR for the Sage Ranch project must

26 disclose, analyze, and avoid or substantially lessen the impacts of supplying water to the project,
27 such as (a) effects of reduced surface water supplies on agricultural resources and other existing
28 District water users, (b) impacts of the use of private water rights as supplemental water sources
00057004.1 18

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 or the use of City fees to obtain supplemental water sources, (c) water quality issues, (d) adverse

2 impacts to air quality from increased dust and particulate matter, (e) impacts of requiring the

3 applicant to "construct an equivalent water savings project that has the effect of reducing current

4 potable water demand elsewhere in the City as an 'in-lieu' method of achieving the water demand

5 requirements of the Project," and (f) social and economic impacts of reduced water supplies on

6 local communities. (Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, supra, 40 Cal.4th at pp.

7 432-434; Preserve Wild Santee, supra, 210 Cal.App.4th at pp. 282-286.)

8 68. The EIR for the Sage Ranch project fails to meet CEQA's standards for water

9 supply analysis and instead simply assumes that a solution to potential supply issues will be

10 found. (Draft EIR, pp. 3.19-20 - 3.19-21, 4-4 • 4-5 ["analysis" of cumulative water supply

11 impacts]; Final EIR, pp. 3.19-32 - 3.19-33; Updated WSA, July 2021, p. 26.) Uncertainties

12 regarding future water supplies must be fully examined in order to satisfy CEQA's informational
13 purposes. (Vineyard Área Citizens for Responsible Growth, supra, 40 Cal.4tb at p. 434; Napa

14 Citizens for Honest Government, supra, 91 Cal.App.4th at p. 373 [EIR must disclose not only the
15 possible water supplies, but the environmental consequences of using the alternative supplies];

16 Preserve Wild Santee, supra, 210 Cal.App.4th at pp. 283-285 [same].) Future water supplies
17 must bear a "likelihood of actually proving available" and the EIR must discuss the circumstances

18 affecting the likelihood of the water's availability. (Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible

19 Growth, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 432.)
20 69. An EIR cannot rely on "paper water" by simply stating, as the City's Sage Ranch
21 EIR does, that "[t]he applicant will be required to secure/purchase water rights to serve the

22 Project and/or pay in-lieu fees as determined by the City (for the City to purchase additional

23 water for recharge)." (Draft EIR, pp. 3.10-17 - 3.10-18, 3.19-20 - 3.19-21; Final EIR, pp. 3.10-

24 11 - 3.10-32; Updated WSA, July 2021, p. 26.) A reasonable probability of accessing an
25 identified source of "wet water" must be shown. (Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible

26 Growth, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 432; Santa Clarita Organization for Planning the Environment v.

27 County of Los Angeles (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 149, 159 ["future water supplies identified and

28 analyzed must bear a likelihood of actually proving available; speculative sources and unrealistic
00057004.1 19

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 allocations ('paper water') are insufficient bases for decisionmaking under CEQA"].) "An EIR

2 for a land use project must address the impacts of likely future water sources, and the EIR's

3 discussion must include a reasoned analysis of the circumstances affecting the likelihood of the

4 water's availability." (Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 432

5 [emphasis in original], citing California Oak Foundation v. City of Santa Clarita (2005) 133

6 Cal.App.4th 1219, 1244.)

7 70. If there is uncertainty about the availability of identified future water supplies,

8 CEQA requires an examination of possible alternative sources and the environmental

9 consequences of using such sources. (Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, supra, 40

10 Cal.4th at p. 432; Stanislaus Natural Heritage Project v. County of Stanislaus (1996) 48

11 Cal.App.4th 182, 206 [before certifying the EIR, the decision-making body must be "informed of

12 the intended source or sources of water for the project, "what the impact will be if supplied from a
13 particular source or possible sources and if that impact is adverse how it will be addressed"T.)

14 71. The City's approval of almost 1,000 new M&I connections solely in the Sage
15 Ranch project (in a City of 3,000 existing M&I connections) occurs against the backdrop of
16 extreme (indeed, "Exceptional") drought conditions in the region and in the state. The EIR and

17 WSA fail to address the incremental and cumulative (in combination with other past, present, and
18 reasonably foreseeable future projects) effects of the Sage Ranch project on water resources,

19 water supply, and public utilities, and therefore must be substantially revised to comply with
20 CEQA's mandates.

21 72. The EIR and WSA substantially overstate the amount of surface water available to

22 the District and, therefore, to the City.

23 a, The WSA erroneously assumes "average SWP deliveries at 60%

24 longterm." (Updated WSA, July 2021, pp. 21, 29, 31; see also 2015 RUWMP, p. 2-20.) The

25 WSA relies on an outdated long-term average, and incorrectly assumes that SWP allocation is

26 equivalent to deliveries in the Tehachapi Basin. The WSA asserts that it relies on more recent

27 water use information from the June 2019 City of Tehachapi - Water and Sewer Systems of•
28 Modeling, Planning, and Fee Studies Update. That document, however, does not reflect the Sage
00057004.1 20

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

Ranch project's actual demand, assuming instead that over the next ten years only 150 single-
2 family units and 350 multi-family units will be built, which is approximately half the number of

3 units the Sage Ranch project proposes. Further, while the 25-year average for SWP allocations is
4 61.04%, environmental restrictions in the Delta and climate change make the 25-year average an

5 unreliable predictor of future SWP allocations. With SWP reservoir storage at an all-time low,

6 the 10-year 40.5% allocation and 15-year 44.7% allocation are more realistic estimates of future

7 allocation trends.

8 b. Perhaps more critical, the District's pumping capacity is limited to a
maximum of 10,000 AFY. The District's SWP allocation is 19,300 AFY. The District cannot

10 import more than 51.8% of its allocation in any given year. Thus, estimated deliveries must take

11 into account the acute restriction on the District's ability to import water in years when SWP
12 allocation exceeds 51.8%. When the SWP allocations are adjusted to factor in system capacity,
13 actual SWP deliveries are reduced to 33.2% on a 10-year average, and a 37.5% on a 15-year
14 average.

15 C. The EIR and WSA are fatally flawed because they substantially overstate

16 the amount of surface water available to the District and the City, and understate the
17 environmental consequences of the Sage Ranch project.

18 73. The EIR fails to consider potential injury to other legal users of water and resulting
19 environmental impacts.

20 a. The District simply does not have sufficient water supplies and recharge
21 capacity to meet the City's anticipated demand. No surplus water exists in the system; this is not
22 some speculative future event - the District's supply is already strained. Simply put, the City is
23 attempting to commit the District to provide water it does not have.

24 b. Implementation of the Sage Ranch project will have significant and
25 unavoidable impacts on water resources, water supply, and public utilities that the EIR fails to

26 disclose - it will decrcase supplies for existing District water users and exacerbate shortages. The
27 EIR fails to analyze the significant adverse consequences of supplying the City with water while
28 substantially reducing water deliveries to the District's other customers. For example, alternative
00057004.1 21

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 water supplies for agricultural use are limited, and the need for new supplies is likely to exceed

2 available alternatives. As a result, fallowing and potential permanent loss of agricultural

3 resources would add to the significant adverse environmental impacts of the Sage Ranch project,
4 including cumulative impacts that will occur over time. (CEQA Guidelines, App. G, §§ II(a),

5 (e), III(a)-(c), VII(b) [Fallowing of agricultural lands and potential permanent loss of agricultural

6 resources would have obvious attendant environmental impacts such as soil erosion and loss of

7 topsoil, as well as additional dust and particulate emissions.])

8 C. The City currently pumps a maximum of 1,847 AFY of groundwater from

9 the Tehachapi Basin but estimates that it will increase pumping to 3,550 AFY by 2040. (Updated

10 WSA, July 2021, p. 25 [Table 4-1, column MJ). Yet nowhere in the EIR does the City analyze
11 the impact on non-City wells of increasing its groundwater use by alinost 50%. (Draft EIR, pp.
12 3.10-1 - 3.10-20; Final EIR, pp. 3.10-16 - 3.10-18.)

13 d. As the California Supreme Court has explained, "CEQA requires more

14 than a reference to a water supply management practice as water supply analysis.' How much
15 groundwater, existing and new, will be used with how much new surface water? In what

16 combinations will these sources be used during wet and dry years, respectively?" (Vineyard Area
17 Citizens for Responsible Growth, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 440.) The City's EIR, like the faulty
18 EIR in the Vineyard case, provides "[njo such description of planned future water use.) (Ibid.)
19 Here, as in Vineyard, "[t]he conjunctive use program ... lacks quantification, with no analysis

20 that would disclose whether the program will produce sufficient supplies and storage capacity to
21 meet expected demands." (Ibid.)

22 74. The EIR's conclusions that impacts related to water resources, water supply, and

23 public utilities will be mitigated to less-than-significant levels are unsupported by substantial

24 evidence.

25 a. As described above, an EIR cannot ignore the problem of supplying water

26 to a development or simply assume a solution; it must include "sufficient facts to *evaluate the

27 pros and cons of supplying the amount of water that the [project] will need."* (Vineyard Area

28 Citizens for Responsible Growth, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 429, quoting Santiago County Water
00057004.1 22

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 District v. County of Orange (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 818, 829-831.) "[Tjhe future water supplies
2 identified and analyzed [in an EIR] must bear a likelihood of actually proving available;

3 speculative sources and unrealistic allocations (*paper water') are insufficient bases for
decisionmaking under CEQA." (Id. at p. 432, quoting Santa Clarita, supra, 106 Cal.App.4th at
pp. 720-723). The EIR "must include a reasoned analysis of the circumstances affecting the

6 likelihood of the water's availability." (Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, supra,
7 40 Cal.4th at p. 432.) If "it is impossible to confidently determine that anticipated future water

8 sources will be available, CEQA requires some discussion of possible replacement sources or
alternatives to use of the anticipated water, and the environmental consequences of those

10 contingencies." (Ibid.)

11 b. The City's evaluation of water resources, water supply, and public utilities
12 for the Sage Ranch project violates all three of these basic principles because the information in

13 the EIR and WSA about the ability of the applicant to obtain native water rights - and therefore
14 any additional water -is pure speculation, without regard to the timing, sufficiency, quality, or
15 sustainability of acquiring such rights, or whether there may be competing claims for them.

16 (Draft EIR, pp. 3.19-16 - 3.19-21; Final EIR, pp. 3.10-30 - 3.10-32, 3.19-32- 3.19-33; Updated
17 WSA, July 2021, p. 26.) The documents the City expects to rely on merely state that "[t]he

18 Project proponent shall procure per-unit water rights sufficient to meet the projected water
19 demand as calculated in the Project Water Supply Assessment." (Draft EIR, p. 3.19-21; Updated
20 WSA, July 2021, p. 26; see also Final EIR, pp. 3.10-30, 3.19-32; MMRP-12.)

21 C. No indication is given in the EIR or WSA as to where or how these rights
22 have been or will be obtained or exercised, or as to the actual availability of any additional water,
23 or any evaluation of the environmental consequences of acquiring, delivering, and using it. (Draft
24 EIR, pp. 3.19-16- 3.19-21; Final EIR, pp. 3.10-30 -3.10-32, 3.19-32 - 3.19-33; Updated WSA,

25 July 2021, p. 26.) This approach violates the Water Code, the Government Code, and CEQA.
26 (See Wat. Code, § 10910; Gov. Code, § 66473.7; Pub. Resources Code, § 21151.9; Center for
27 Biological Diversity v. County of San Bernardino (2010) 185 Cal.App.4th 866, 887 [water supply
28 analysis is inadequate when it fails to evaluate and disclose the actual availability of potential
00057004.1 23
Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

water sources].) The last-minute submissions by the project applicant - which, at best, are of

2 uncertain effectiveness and questionable enforceability, and were never described or analyzed in

3 the EIR or WSA as required by law - of an insufficient amount of water that was not analyzed in
the EIR does not satisfy CEQA's strict mandates.

5 d. "The EIR must contain facts and analysis, not just the bare conclusions of

6 the agency." (Santiago Water District, supra, 118 Cal.App.3d at p. 831.) Under CEQA, the City

7 owes other public agencies and the public in general a full and accurate accounting of the

8 project's clements, its environmental impacts, mitigation measures, and potential alternatives, for
review on a timeline that makes such disclosure meaningful. The EIR fails to meet these

10 standards.

11 75. Significant cumulative impacts to water resources, water supply, and public

12 utilities must be analyzed and mitigated.

13 a. In times of water supply shortage, the District has historically met existing
14 current year demands first and deferred water recharge. The City estimates that it will require

15 1560.5 AFY to meet 2040 demand - an increase of 1,213 AF over the next 20 years. (Updated
16 WSA, July 2021.) The District recharges water for many customers including Golden Hills CSD,

17 Stallion Springs CSD and Bear Valley CSD. Further, there are entitled undeveloped lots in the

18 pipeline that expect to draw from the District. Bear Valley CSD and Stallion Springs CSD, for

19 example, have approximately 1,000 entitled undeveloped lots. The District simply does not have
20 sufficient water supplies and recharge capacity to meet the City's anticipated demand and also

21 meet the planned demands of the District's existing customers.

22 b. The EIR fails to analyze the significant adverse consequences of the City's
23 proposal - that the District should meet the City's surging demands while substantially reducing

24 water deliveries to the District's other existing customers. Even if supplies were available, the

25 City would need to take the water on the surface and treat the water to potable standards. The

26 WSA incorrectly assumes that the District would deliver the water as recharge. (Updated WSA,
27 July 2021, p. 21.)

1 C, The WSA states that the "City anticipates that sufficient supplies will be

2 reasonably available for purchase from the [District] and will have been previously recharged for

3 recovery during the average, single dry and multiple dry years[.J" (Updated WSA, July 2021, p.

4 21.) "Anticipates" is just another word for "assumes," and the City's assumption is not

5 supported by evidence in the record. To the contrary, the City has not asked the District for its

6 projections of available supply and recharge, and there is no evidence in the record to support the

7 City's assumption. In reality, it is unlikely that the District will have sufficient water available to

8 recharge 1,560 AFY for the City and meet the recharge requirements of the District's other

9 existing customers.

10 Failure to Identify and Adopt Feasible, Effective, and Enforceable Mitigation Measures
11 76. CEQA requires public agencies to adopt feasible mitigation measures (or: feasible

12 environmentally superior alternatives) to avoid or substantially lessen otherwise significant

13 adverse environmental impacts. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21002, 21081(a); CEQA Guidelines,

14 §§ 15002(a)(3), 15021(a)(2), 15091(a)(1).) To effectuate this requirement, EIRs must identify

15 mitigation measures that decision makers can adopt at the findings stage of the CEQA process.

16 (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21100(b)(3); CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15126(e), 15126.4, 15370.) CEQA

17 does not permit the lead agency to conclude that significant impacts will be mitigated by vague,

18 incomplete, speculative or untested mitigation measures. (Federation of Hillside & Canyon

19 Associations v. City of Los Angeles (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 260, 281 [speculative measures do not

20 constitute mitigation]; Kings County Farm Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d

21 692, 727 [mitigation agreement calling for purchase of replacement groundwater supplies without

22 specifying whether water was available violated CEQA].)

23 77. Most, if not all, of the mitigation measures presented in the EIR and Monitoring

24 and Reporting Program regarding water resources, water supply, and public utilities for the Sage

25 Ranch project attempt to patch serious information gaps in the EIR and WSA and are inadequate,

26 either because they do not constitute mitigation as defined under CEQA, are vague and uncertain,

27 or are improper deferral of analysis and mitigation to some future point - after project approval --

28 without any performance standards or specific criteria to ensure effectiveness and enforceability.
00057004.1 25

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 (Pub, Resources Code, § 21100, subd. (b)(3); CEQA Guidelines, § § 15126, subd. (e), 15126.4,

2 15370.) The so-called mitigation measures regarding water supply are not tethered to any
enforceable program or standard and fail to address the potentially significant impacts of the

4 project. CEQA requires much more, particularly at the mapping stage. (CEQA Guidelines, § §
15144, 15151; Kings County Farm Bureau, supra, 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 727-728.) The

6 information presented is too general to enable decision-makers to make required CEQA findings

7 as to whether particular mitigation measures purporting to ensure water supply for the Sage

8 Ranch project would be effective and enforceable, much less whether they would be feasible.

9 (King & Gardiner Farms, LLC v. County of Kern (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 814, 869 ["the level of

10 detail provided in the EIR about mitigation for the significant water supply impacts fails to enable
11 the public and decision makers to understand and consider meaningfully the issues relating to

12 water supply impacts and mitigating those impacts"].)

13 78. Mitigation measure HYD-3 uses a circular argument to avoid addressing the Sage

14 Ranch project's water supply shortfall, which the EIR and WSA both substantially understate.

15 Paraphrased, the EIR says that the primary source of water is from the District - the assumed

16 1,153 AF stated in the 2015 RUWMP and Term M&I Agreement. Additionally, the project

17 proponent will purchase 93 AF of Tehachapi Basin water rights to meet secondary demand above

18 baseline growth assumptions, (Draft EIR, pp. MMRP-12, 3.10-18, 3.19-21, 4-5; Final EIR, p.
19 32.) Then, for each housing unit not covered by the primary and secondary supply, the Applicant
20 shall pay a City fee used to purchase water rights available within the value of the fee or "import

21 a 20-year supply of water through [the District]." (Updated WSA, July 2021, p. 26.) Since the 93

22 AF of water rights appears to be a necessary - though insufficient - component of the project
23 water supply, it is not appropriately characterized as a "mitigation measure." (CEQA Guidelines,

24 § 15126.4(a)(1)(A); Lotus V. Department of Transportation (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 645, 656-
25 658, and fn. 8.)

26 79. Furthermore, if Tehachapi Basin groundwater rights are not available, the next

27 "mitigation measurc" is simply a restatement of the primary source of water under the Term M&I

28 Agreement - buy water from the District - without any analysis of whether the water is
00057004.1 26

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 actually available on the surface, as recharge, or at all. Indeed, the M&I Agreement provides that

2 "District has no obligation to sell to Water Uger more than 1,153 AF per year." As explained

3 above, moreover, the Term M&I Agreement has a 10-year term, and the District will not provide

4 a 20-year commitment.

5 80. In addition, a commitment to pay fees does not by itself establish an adequate

6 water supply, nor is it adequate mitigation for water supply impacts if there is no evidence that
7 mitigation will actually result. Fees must be a paid in connection with a reasonable, enforceable
8 plan for mitigation that is sufficiently tied to actual mitigation of the project impact at issue.
9 (Anderson First Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173, 1188-1189;

10 California Clean Energy Committee v. City of Woodland (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 173, 197-198;
11 Gray v. County of Madera (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1099, 1122.) A fee requirement is not

12 adequate or effective mitigation where, as here, the City has acknowledged that payment of fees
13 is not likely to be sufficient to purchase the necessary additional water supplies, and where the
14 source of those supplies is unknown. (Draft EIR, pp. 3.10-18, 3.19-21; Final EIR, pp. 3.19-32;
15 Updated WSA, July 2021, p. 26.)

16 81. On August 11, 2021, just days before the City Council hearing on the Sage Ranch

17 project, Real Party Ciachurski, on behalf of various Greenbriar entities, submitted a letter

18 purporting to commit "175 AF of pumpable water allocation" to the Sage Ranch project.

19 Although the District appreciates the late effort to resolve water supply concerns, this attempt is
20 inadequate because the environmental impacts of providing water through this new source have
21 not been analyzed, and in addition to being too late, it is still insufficient. The amount of water

22 allegedly committed to the project by the Applicant (but not analyzed, conditioned, or verified by
23 the City) is insufficient to meet the project's demand.

24 82. The City improperly deferred analysis of project impacts and formulation of
25 specific mitigation strategies and thresholds for action until after project approval. Key
26 requirements for mitigation and monitoring are missing from the adopted conditions of approval,
27 including the failure to condition Sage Ranch tentative map to make a verification of available

28 water supply prior to finalizing its subdivision map as required under state law. (Gov. Code, §
00057004.1 27

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 66473.7(b).) As a result, neither the City nor the public will be able to effectively monitor the

2 project's impacts.

3 Failure to Identify a Reasonable Range of Alternatives/

4 Provide Sufficient Information to Permit a Reasoned Choice
5 83. CEQA requires a lead agency to adopt feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation
6 measures that can avoid or substantially lessen the proposed project's significant environmental

7 impacts. (Pub, Resources Code, §§ 21002-21002.1; CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15002(a)(3),

8 15126.6(a); Sierra Club v. Gilroy Cuty Council (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 30, 41.) CEQA's

9 substantive mandate makes the mitigation and alternative sections the "core of an EIR." (Citizens

10 of Goleta Valley, supra, 52 Cal.3d at p. 564.) The purpose of an environmental impact report is
11 to identify the significant effects of the project on the environment, to identify alternatives to the

12 project, and to indicate the manner in which the project's significant effects can be mitigated or
13 avoided. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21002.1, 21061.)

14 84. Consistent with this purpose, the EIR must "describe a range of reasonable
15 alternatives to the project, or to the location of the project, which would feasibly attain most of

16 the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant
17 effects of the project, and evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives." (CEQA

18 Guidelines, § 15126.6(a).) EIRs "must produce information sufficient to permit a reasonable

19 choice of alternatives so far as environmental aspects are concerned." (San Bernardino Valley
20 Audubon Society v. County of San Bernardino (1984) 155 Cal.App.3d 738, 750-751; see CEQA
21 Guidelines, §15126.6(f).) The City's EIR for the Sage Ranch project violates CEQA because it
22 fails to comply with these requirements. (Draft EIR, pp. 5-1 -5-8.)

23 85. The Sage Ranch EIR considered three alternatives: (1) No Project; (2) Alternative

24 Location; and (3) Reduced (50%) Project. (Draft EIR, p. 5-2.) The range of alternatives
25 presented in the EIR reflects the "straw man" set-up that CBQA prohibits. It involves only an

26 alternative location that the EIR advocates against rather than evaluates, and a reduced density
27 alternative that eliminates 50% of the development so that the EIR can assert, without any

28 evidence, that "economic considerations" eliminate it from discussion. (Draft EIR, pp. 5-6 -5-8.)
00057004.1 28

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 86. The Draft EIR's discussion of alternatives violates CBQA because it skirts
2 important environmental issues and is framed to advocate for the project rather than to
3 meaningfully consider environmentally superior alternatives. (Draft EIR, pp. 5-1 --5-8; see
Habitat Watershed Caretakers v. City of Santa Cruz (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1305.) The
5 Draft EIR raises significant concerns of its improper use as an advocacy document to build

6 support for the project ratber than objectively analyze its impacts and meaningfully consider

7 alternatives to avoid or reduce those impacts. (Planning & Conservation League, supra, 83

8 Cal.App.4th at p. 918 [CEQA requires objective analysis, not advocacy].)
9 87. In a string of unsupported assertions and non sequiturs designed to deflect the

10 inherent reasonableness of reducing the project's size to avoid or reduce its significant adverse

11 enviroumental effects, the EIR states:

12 Economics are not generally included in CEQA analysis unless a
13 project results in blight to other areas of the City. However, in this instance, one of the Project objectives to is [sic] provide an
14 cconomically viable residential project that provides t variety of

15 housing options within the City's growing population base. A reduced project size is likely to make the project infeasible because
16 it would not meet the City's goal of having diverse housing. A lower density project would likely result in a single-family
17 neighborhood, which does not provide a variety of housing types and would not be consistent with the City's General Plan which
18 expressly requires projects of this size to contain a diversity of

19 housing types.
(Draft EIR, p. 5-6.)
20

21 88. The Draft EIR's alternatives chapter goes on to conclude, based on several pages

22 of boilerplate and advocacy in favor of the project, and very little else, that "[a]fter this full,

23 substantial, and deliberate analysis, the proposed Project remains the preferred alternative."

24 (Draft EIR, p. 5-8; see id. at pp. 5-1 - 5-8.)

25 89. Yet the EIR omits at least one obvious potentially feasible alternative - a project

26 of reduced size that maintains the same or similar relative percentages of diverse housing types as

27 are presented within the proposed project. (See Draft BIR, p. 2-4 [Table 2-1].)

28 ///

00057004.1 29

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 90. The EIR contains an overly narrow range of alternatives in light of the nature of

2 the Sage Ranch project and its environmental effects, and the range of alternatives it presents is

3 unreasonable in the absence of the omitted alternatives. (Saltonsall v. City of Sacramento (2015)
4 234 Cal.App.4th 549, 576; Watsonville Pilots Association v. City of Watsonville (2010) 183

5 Cal.App.4th 1059, 1087; California Native Plant Society V. City of Santa Cruz (2009) 177

6 Cal.App.4th 957, 992.) In short, the EIR's approach to alternatives violates CEQA because it is
7 designed to thwart rather than to foster informed decision making and public participation,

8 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.6(a)-(f); Bay Area Citizens v. Association of Bay Area Governments
9 (2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 966, 1017.)

10 Inadequate Responses to Comments

11 91, The Final EIR is inadequate because it fails to provide reasoned responses, based

12 on accurate data, to comments from the District and others. (Final EIR, pp. 20-35; CEQA
13 Guidelincs, § 15088(c); see Flanders Foundation v. City of Carmel-by-the-Sea (2012) 202

14 Cal.App.4th 603, 616; California Oak Foundation, supra, 133 Cal.App.4th 1219.) Adequate
15 responses to comments on the Draft EIR are of particular importance where, as here, significant
16 environmental issues are raised in comments submitted by experts or by regulatory agencies with
17 specialized expertise. (Sce Banning Ranch Conservancy, supra, 2 Cal.5th at p. 940.) When

18 credible expert opinion suggests that the EIR's assessment of a significant impact is flawed and
19 that further study is needed (see, e.g., the District's comments, Final EIR, pp. 20-23), then the

20 EIR's analysis is fatally deficient unless the final EIR responds with a further evaluation or a

21 reasonable explanation, supported by evidence, for not doing so. (Flanders Foundation, supra,

22 202 Cal.App.4th at pp. 616-617; Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay Committee v. Board of Port
23 Commissioners (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1362, 1367, 1371.)

24 92. Broad statements and conclusions unsupported by factual information are not an
25 adequate response; questions raised about significant environmental issues must be addressed in

26 detail. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15088, subd. (c); City of Maywood v. Los Angeles Unified School

27 District (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 362, 391.) Here, the Final EIR's responses to comments on the

28 /11

00057004.1 30
Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 Draft EIR from the District and SWRCB contain the same fatal flaws as the Draft EIR, because

2 they rely on information that is insufficient, inaccurate, and misleading.
c 93. By failing to provide adequate responses to public agency comments and proposed
4 mitigation measures and alternatives, the City prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to

5 proceed in the manner required by law.

6 Failure to Recirculate the EIR

7 94. Prior to certification of the Final EIR, the City received significant new

8 information regarding the environmental impacts of the Sage Ranch project including, but not

0 limited to, information regarding the elements of the project and its water sources; impacts of the

10 project related to water resources, water supply, public utilities; and associated mitigation

11 measures and alternatives. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15088.5.) Such information was not circulated

12 to the public or to responsible and trustee agencies, Meaningful public review and comment was

13 thereby precluded. (See Cadiz Land Company, Inc. V, Rail Cycle, L.P. (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 74,
14 87.)

15 95. By failing to recirculate significant new information for review by the public and

16 responsible and trustee agencies, the City prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed

17 in the manner required by law.

18 Findingg Not Supported by Substantial Evidence

19 96. CEQA requires that an agency's findings for approval of a project, including its
20 findings regarding significant environmental impacts and feasible alternatives and mitigation

21 measures, all be supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. Moreover,

22 CEQA requires that an agency provide an explanation of how the evidence in the record supports

23 the agency's conclusions. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15091.) To make the findings required under

24 CEQA regarding a project's potential significant effects and the feasibility or infeasibility of

25 mitigation measures and alternatives, the agency's EIR first must properly identify, evaluate,

26 assess, and analyze the project's potential environmental impacts.

27 /1/

28 11

00057004.1 31

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 97. The City violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter of

2 law in that they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record. The unsupported findings

3 include, but are not limited to, the following:
4 (a) The determination that certain impacts would be less than significant
n and/or that adopted mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the Sage Ranch project's

6 significant effects on the environment, including but not limited to direct, indirect, and

7 cumulative impacts on water resources, water supply, and public utilities; and

8 (b) The determination that alternatives to the Sage Ranch project and proposed

9 mitigation measures that would have avoided or lessened the significant impacts of the project

10 were infeasible, including but not limited to mitigation measures and/or alternatives identified by
11 the District.

12 98. The findings prepared for the Sage Ranch project and adopted by the City,

13 including those contained in the documents in support of the project approvals, do not comply

14 with Water Code section 10911, subdivision (c); they are not supported by substantial evidence;
15 and they do not bridge the analytical gap between the evidence and the decision as required under

16 CEQA.

17 99. As a result of the foregoing defects, the City prejudicially abused its discretion by
18 making determinations or adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA
19 or the Water Code and approving the Sage Ranch project in reliance thereon.

20 Failure to Consult with the District in Good Faith

21 100. The District does not seek perfection in the City's review of Sage Ranch or any

22 other development project, but does seek to require the City to provide an informative and legally
23 adequate assessment of water supply concerns. Instead, the City improperly assumed that paper

24 entitlements to water will materialize and treated those future paper entitlements as water that
25 would actually be physically available. (See Draft EIR, pp. MMRP-12, 3.10-14 - 3.10-18; Final

26 EIR, pp. 3.10-11 - 3.10-32; see also Updated WSA, July 2021, p. 26.) The Sage Ranch EIR and

27 WSA gloss over important environmental issucs, make inaccurate and erroneous assumptions

28 about the District's ability to serve the City with water, and fail to satisfy their informational and
00057004.1 32

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 substantive purposes. These failures stem, in large part, from the City's failure to meaningfully

2 engage with the District regarding water supply.

3 101. CEQA requires the lead agency to adequately evaluate potentially feasible
4 mitigation measures and alternatives to the proposed action, to adopt all feasible mitigation

5 measures and/or alternatives, to determine whether the proposed mitigation measures are, in fact,
6 feasible and whether they will or will not be effective in avoiding or substantially lessening the

7 project's significant environmental impacts, and to make conclusions regarding impact

8 significance based on adequate analysis and substantial evidence. To do so, CEQA contemplates
9 an interactive process of assessment and responsive modification that must be genuine. Use of

10 the environmental review process to advocate for and justify project approval violates CEQA.

11 102. By failing to meaningfully and genuinely engage with the District regarding the
12 water supply analysis in the EIR and WSA, and by disregarding the District's concerns regarding
13 the uncertainty of, and impacts associated with, supplying water to the Sage Ranch project, the
14 City has subverted both the letter and intent of CEQA as well as Senate Bill ("SB") 610 and SB

15 221 - statutes in the Water Code and Government Code aimed at improving communication

16 between local planning agencies, developers, and the public water systems that serve them.

17 (McCormick, Kidman & Behrens, Association of California Water Agencies ("ACWA"), Water

18 Supply and Development: A User's Guide to California Statutes Including SB 221 and SB 610

19 (2002) [giving details on the state's "show me the water" laws and an account of the legislative
20 history].) Under these statutes, cities and counties generally cannot make the determination of

21 adequate water supplies on their own but must instead obtain this information from the local

22 water utility that would be serving the project. While the City provides water service connections

23 to its residents, the District is the sole source of the City's imported water supply. (Draft EIR, pp.
24 3.10-1, 3.19-1; Final EIR, p. 3.10-22-25, 3.19-1; Updated WSA, July 2021, p. 29.) The City's
25 failure to consult in good faith with the District is prejudicial because it has resulted in a deeply

26 flawed EIR and WSA.

27 1//

- 103.

2 The City, by certifying the EIR, adopting the WSA, and approving the Sage Ranch

3 project despite these violations of CEQA, the Water Code, and the Government Code,
prejudicially abused its discretion.

4 B. Second Cause of Action - Water Code Violations

5 104.

6 The District hereby realleges and incorporates by reference each and every
allegation set fortli above, inclusive.

7 105.

8 State law requires specific projections about water availability to be developed

9 before certain large development projects to be served by public water system may be approved.

10 (Wat. Code, §g 10910-10915.) To that end, the public water system identified as the water

11 provider for a proposed project must prepare a water supply assessment that is then to be included
in the project EIR. (CEQA Guidelines, §15155.)

12 106.

13 Water supply assessments are required to address a broad range of issues relating

14 to existing water supply entitlements, water rights, and water service contracts supporting the

15 water supply identified for the proposed project, with accurate descriptions of the quantities of

16 water received in prior years under those existing entitlements, rights, and contracts. (Wat. Code,

17 § 10910(c), (d), and (e).) To provide a realistic assessment, the evaluation also should identify

18 other parties that receive water or have entitlements, water rights, or contracts giving them rights

19 to the same source of water. (Wat. Code, § 10910(e); see, e.g., Madera Oversight Coalition, Inc.

20 V. County of Madera (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 48, 104 [water supply assessment rejected for

21 failing to evaluate information showing that the water entitlement relied on in the assessment was
uncertain].)

22 107.

23 If the water agency determines that its supplies will be insufficient to meet the

24 demands of planned growth and the project, it must also describe plans for acquiring additional
water supplies - the

25 agency cannot merely assume, as the City has done for the Sage Ranch

26 project, that additional supplies will be acquired by either the Applicant or the City from

27 unidentified sources at unknown cost or quality. (Wat. Code, 10911; see, e.g., Updated WSA,
July 2021, p. 26; see also Draft EIR, pp. MMRP-12, 3.10-18, 3.19-21; Final EIR, pp. 3.10-30 -
28 3.10-31, 3.19-32- 3.19-33, MMRP-12.)
00057004.1 34

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 108. An adequate water supply assessment is necessary to inform the analysis in the
N m vo 0N EIR, which must include the following:
Sufficient information on water demand and water supplies for the lead agency to evaluate
the pros and cons of supplying the project with the water it will need;
Analysis of the reasonably foreseeable impacts of supplying the water;
Analysis of the circumstances affecting the likelihood that sufficient water will be
available, and the degree of uncertainty involved; and
8 If the lead agency cannot determine that a particular water supply will be available, an
9 analysis of alternate available water sources, or project alternatives that could be served

10 with available water.

11 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15155(f).)

12 109. The WSA for the Sage Ranch project is inadequate to inform the EIR because it

13 glosses over critical issues to conclude, without evidence, that projected water supplies will be

14 sufficient for the project in addition to existing and planned future uses. (Wat. Code § 10911(b),
15 (c).)

16 Reliance on a Water Supply Assessment Based on Outdated Information, Erroneous

17 Assumptions, and Insufficient Data

18 110. The challenge of ensuring adequate water supply is increasingly difficult in

19 extreme drought conditions, with ever-growing strains on the state's resources. Nearly all of
20 Kern County currently operates in a state of "Exceptional Drought," as depicted by the National

21 Integrated Drought Information System. (https://www.drought.gov/states/california/county/kern.)
22 Exceptional Drought is the most severe category of drought conditions identified, beyond
23 "Severe" and "Extreme," and historically has resulted in inadequate water supply for existing
24 agriculture, wildlife, and urban needs; reservoirs are extremely low; and surface water allocations
25 are slashed. (https://water.ca.gov/News/News-Releases/2021/March-21/SWP-Allocation-Update

26 March-23.) This results in fallowing of agricultural fields and removal of orchards, extensive and

1 infestation, wildlife death, and loss of wetlands, among other impacts.

2 (https://www.drought.gov/states/california.)

3 111. Persistent drought conditions and lower SWP allocations are increasingly
4 common, which means that responsible management of water resources is now more vital than

5 ever. As the Department of Water Resources, operator of the SWP observes, "[o]ngoing drought

6 conditions require the coordination of federal, state and local agencies."
7 (https://water.ca.gov/News/News-Releascs/2021/March-21/SWP-Allocation-Update-March-23.)

8 Yet the City failed to coordinate with the District regarding water supply for the Sage Ranch

9 project and prepared its own WSA based on outdated information, erroneous assumptions, and

10 insufficient data.

11 112. The WSA relies heavily on irrelevant and outdated information,

12 a. Given the level of detail and information required in an Urban Water

13 Management Plan, an up-to-date RUWMP can significantly reduce the burden of preparing a

14 WSA. (Wat. Code, § 10910(c)(2); Pub. Resources Code, § 21151.9.) At the same time, however,
15 and particularly under evolving circumstances substantially affecting surface water allocations

16 from the SWP, cities and counties may encounter outdated information in RUWMPs that cannot

17 be taken at face value. (Sce Final EIR, p. 20 [District Comment Letter on Draft EIR].)

18 b. Adopted RUWMPs may be used as source documents only to the extent

19 they are relevant to the project under consideration and the information in them remains reliable.

20 (Wat. Code, § 10651; see Wat. Code, §§ 10610-10656; Friends of Santa Clarita River v. Castaic

21 Lake Water Agency (2004) 123 Cal.App.4th 1, 9 [water supplier's RUWMP and related

22 determinations must be supported by substantial evidence].) Substantial changes that occur after

23 the most recent RUWMP is adopted must be addressed in the WSA and CEQA analyses.

24 (Friends of Santa Clarita River, supra, 123 Cal.App.4th at pp. 13-15 [water supplier caunot rely

25 on an inadequate RUWMP that fails to address reliability of potential supplies based on relevant

26 factors].)

27 C. The Sage Ranch WSA and EIR analyses nevertheless borrowed heavily

28 from the City's 2015 RUWMP, incorporating much of the same language and many of its tables,
00057004.1 36

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 yet failed to explain why such reliance is appropriate given that: (1) the 2015 RUWMP did not

2 account for the Sage Range project's demand in its analysis (Updated WSA, July 2021, pp. 15,

3 23, 27-28 [conceding that the Sage Rauch project's demand was not included in the 2015

4 RUWMP and stating only that the project site is located within 2015 RUWMP's boundaries]);

5 and (2) even if the 2015 RUWMP had accounted for the Sage Ranch project's demand, the

6 information in the 2015 RUWMP fails to reflect substantially changed circumstances and

7 exceptional drought conditions. (See Wat. Code, § 10910(c)(2) [The 2015 RUWMP's

8 information and analysis may be incorporated in the water supply and demand assessment only

9 "[i]f the projected water demand associated with the proposed project was accounted for in the

10 most recently adopted urban water management plan."]; see also Pub. Resources Code, §

11 21151.9; Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, supra, 40 Cal.4th at pp. 434-435

12 [previous overall water planning projections may be used to inform a proposed project's water
13 supply assessment if the individual project's demand was included in the overall water plan].)

14 113. The WSA's assumptions are erroneous.

15 a. The Sage Ranch project, and future City growth, rely almost exclusively on

16 the City's Term M&I Agreement with the District for a water supply. The agreement requires the

17 City to buy water, but the District is under no obligation to sell the City any specific quantity of

18 water. Paragraph 1 of the Term M&I Agreement states an upper limit of 1,153 AFY based on the

19 City's projected 2040 demand. The District's obligation to supply water is expressly

20 "conditioned upon the availability of sufficient SWP water under the KCWA Water Supply

21 Contracts to enable the District to meet all of its Customers' water demands." Thus, the Term

22 M&I Agreement is not a firm commitment to supply a specified quantity of water for 20 years.

23 Further, there is not sufficient water to meet the City's baseline water demand as shown in Table

24 4-1 of the WSA, let alone the 995 new residential connections associated with the Sage Ranch

25 project. (Updated WSA, July 2021, p. 25, [Table 4-1].)

26 b. Even if the District was able to provide the City with 1,153 AFY (the

27 maximum available under the Term M&I Agreement), the City is still short an estimated 407

28 AFY over the 20-year horizon. (Updated WSA, July 2021, p. 25.) Table 4-1 in the WSA,
00057004.1 37

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 columns H and P, estimate that the City will need 1,560 AFY to meet 2040 demand. (Updated

2 WSA, July 2021, p. 25 [Table 4-1].) In fact, by its own estimates, the City will run out of water

3 by 2034. (Updated WSA, July 2021, p. 25.)
71 C. Both the EIR and WSA lack sufficient information to accurately
characterize the extent of the Sage Ranch project's water supply shortfall and have substantially

6 understated the extent of additional supplies necessary to address the shortfall in relation to the

7 project and in the cumulative environmental context.

8 114. The WSA contains insufficient data to satisfy the Water Code or to properly

9 inform the CEQA analysis. The conclusions of the WSA and EIR that the Sage Ranch project's

10 significant impacts related to water resources, water supply, and public utilities will be mitigated

11 to less-than-significant levels are unsupported by substantial evidence.

12 a, The WSA states that "the Applicant will be required, as a mitigation

13 measure, to secure/purchase an additional 93 acre-feet of water rights to serve the project. The
14 Applicant has identified sufficient/available water rights to serve the project." (Updated WSA,
15 July 2021, p. 26.)

16 b. The Tehachapi Basin is small and the available supply of water rights for
17 sale is extremely limited. Neither the EIR nor the WSA identifies the source of the claimed 93

18 acre-feet of water rights, nor is there any evidence in the record that the water rights are the

19 subject of an enforceable commitment to serve the Sage Ranch project through the conditions of
20 approval. (Draft EIR, pp. MMRP-12, 3.10-18, 3.19-21; Final EIR, pp. 3.10-30, 3.19-32; Updated
21 WSA, July 2021, p. 26.)

22 115. For the reasons stated above, and each of them, the City violated its mandatory
23 duties under the Water Code by relying on a WSA that applies a methodology and scope of study
24 that are arbitrary, capricious, and completely lacking in evidentiary support.

25 C. Third Cause of Action - Government Code Violations

26 116. The District hereby realleges and incorporates by reference each and every

27 allegation set forth above, inclusive.

28 /11

00057004.1 38

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 117. To approve a subdivision of this size, the City is required by SB 221 to provide a

2 "written verification" that adequate water supplies will be available to meet the Sage Ranch
e v project's demand. (Gov. Code, §§ 65867.5(€), 66473.7.) A "sufficient water supply" means that
total water supplies available during normal, single-dry and multiple-dry years within a 20-year

5 projection will meet the projected demand associated with the proposed subdivision, in addition

6 to existing and planned future uses, including agricultural and industrial uses. (Gov. Code, §

7 66473.7(a)(2).) If the verification relies on supplies not yet available, then it must be "based on

8 firm indications the water will be available in the future, including written contracts for water

9 rights, approved financing programs for delivery facilities, and the regulatory approvals required

10 to construct infrastructure and deliver the water." (Fineyard Area Citizens for Responsible

11 Growth, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 433, citing Government Code section 66473.7].) If this condition

12 is not satisfied, then the final subdivision map cannot be recorded. (Gov. Code, §§ 65867.5(c);

13 66473.)

14 118. The Sage Ranch project does not qualify for the infill exemption from the

15 verification requirement, as it is not "infill." (Gov. Code, § 66473.7(i) [for purposes of the

16 verification requirement, "infill" is defined as a "residential project proposed for a site that is
17 within an urbanized area and has been previously developed for urban uses, or where the

18 immediate contiguous properties surrounding the residential project site are, or previously have

19 been, developed for urban uses, or housing projects that are exclusively for very low and low-

20 income households"]; see Updated WSA, July 2021, p. 8 [Figure 1, Aerial Map].)

21 119. The Sage Ranch project's water supply cannot be verified based on the City's

22 analysis in the WSA and EIR because they merely assume that the Applicant and/or the City will

23 acquire additional water without identifying any likely source or giving any reasoned indication

24 that the water will be available. (Gov. Code, § 66473.7; Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible

25 Growth, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 433; see Draft EIR, pp. MMRP-12, 3.10-18, 3.19-21; Final EIR,

26 pp. 3.10-30, 3.19-32; Updated WSA, July 2021, p. 26.)

27 //!

28 111

00057004.1 39

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 120. The City violated its mandatory duties under the Government Code by failing to

2 require, as a condition of approval of the Sage Ranch project, a water supply verification prior to

3 finalizing the subdivision map as required by SB 221. (Gov. Code, §§ 65867.5(c); 66473.7.)

4 D. Fourth Cause of Action - City's Pattern and Practice of CEQA Violations

5 121. The District hereby realleges and incorporates by reference each and every

6 allegation set forth above, inclusive.

7 122. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between the District and the City

8 concerning their respective rights and duties in that the District contends the City engages in a

9 pattern and practice of CEQA violations in its analysis, review, and approval of land use and

10 development projects with potentially significant adverse cumulative environmental effects,

11 including but not limited to significant adverse effects related to water resources, water supply,

12 and public utilities, whereas the City disputes these contentions and contends that it has complied

13 with CEQA.

14 123. The District desires a judicial determination and declaration that the City has

15 engaged in a pattern and practice of approving projects without proper analysis of the resulting

16 cumulative impacts, in violation of CEQA. These projects include Sage Ranch with 995 units,

17 the Address with 232 units, Tract 6248 with 30 units, Tract 6507 with 96 units, Tract 6668 with

18 18 units, and Tract 6714 with 74 units. In each of these instances, the City failed to meaningfully

19 consult with the District regarding water supply, failed to analyze the project's environmental

20 impacts, including incremental and cumulative impacts to water resources, and made or intends to

21 make land use decisions approving new development projects that merely assume they will

22 acquire additional water without identifying any likely source or giving any reasoned indication

23 that the water will be available.

24 124, An unknown number of additional projects are also in the City's pipeline,

25 including but not limited to the proposed Dennison Tract with 80 units and an unnamed project

26 currently under City review that proposes another 37 units.

27 125. A judicial resolution of this controversy is necessary and appropriate.

28 (Californians for Native Salmon Etc. Ass'n v. Dep't of Forestry (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 1419.)
00057004.1 40

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

The City's pattern and practice of ignoring the incremental water supply impacts of individual

2 land use and development projects in the cumulative context has created a situation where the
District is unable to serve the needs of existing water users,

4 126. The City apparently believes, and its management has publicly stated, that the

5 local water supply is "drought-proof because of management," and continues to approve

6 additional entitlements with substantial new water demands without appropriate CEQA review,

7 thus compounding water shortages and environmental impacts with each project approval.

8 127. The City has demonstrated a pattern and practice of ignoring its mandatory CEQA

9 duties to thoroughly analyze the water needs and sources of supply of each project, such that this

10 has become the City's policy. The City's policy of refusing to adequately review the water

11 supply impacts of development projects violates and undermines the core purposes of CEQA to

12 fully disclose, analyze, and mitigate the significant direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental

13 consequences of such projects.

14 128. Because no plain and speedy administrative remedy exists to cotrect these

15 violations, the District seeks declaratory and injunctive relief from this Court to halt the City's

16 unlawful pattern and practice.

17 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

18 WHEREFORE, the Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:

19 1. For a writ of mandate or peremptory writ issued under the seal of this Court and

00057004.1 41

Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

-

2 2. requirements of CEQA, the Water Code, and the Government Code;

3 For a judgment determining and declaring that the approval of the Sage Ranch
project does not comply with applicable law and therefore is null and void;

3.

5 For a judgment determining and declaring that the City's pattern and practice of

6 failing to analyze incremental and cumulative project impacts on water resources does not comply

9 injunction, restraining Respondent and Real Parties in Interest from engaging in any project

10 activity or activities and Respondent from implementing its policy of refusing to analyze
incremental and cumulative project impacts on water resources;

11 5. For its costs of suit;

12 6.

13 For reasonable attorneys' fees, including but not limited to fees authorized under

14 Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and/or Government Code section 800; and

7.

15 For such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.
