VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

THE PARTIES

2 1. Ballona Wetlands Land Trust is a non-profit, 501(c)(3) organization founded in

3 1994 with the mission of protecting the greater Ballona Wetlands ecosystem from ongoing

4 threats of urban encroachment. The Land Trust is a California corporation with its principal

5 place of business in Playa Del Rey, California. In this suit, Petitioner represents the interests of
its Board of Directors, members, and volunteers, and other constituents being too numerous to
6 name individually.
7 2. Respondent Department of Fish and Wildlife is a state agency established by
8 Division 2 of the California Fish and Game Code (sections 700 - 1940) which owns and

9 manages the Ballona Wetlands Ecological Reserve ("BWER") and is the lead state agency for

10 the Ballona Wetlands Restoration Project (*Project").

11 3. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names or capacities of the respondents sued

12 herein under the fictitious names DOES 1 through 10, and will seek leave to amend this petition

13 to identify them in their true names and capacities when and if identified.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
14
4. This case is properly classified as an unlimited civil case, and therefore within the
15 jurisdiction of this court, because it is not one of the types of cases listed as limited civil cases in
16 sections 85 or 86 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

17 5. This court has personal jurisdiction over the California Department of Fish and

18 Wildlife because the Respondent is a state government agency of California.

19 6. Venue is properly laid in this court under Civil Procedure Code section 401,

20 because this is an action against a state agency, and section 401 provides that any action against a

21 state agency which may be commenced, tried in, or removed to Sacramento, may also be

22 commenced and tried in any county in which the state Attorney General maintains an office. The
California Attorney General maintains an office in Los Angeles County at S 300 S Spring St
23 #1700, Los Angeles, CA 90013.
24 BACKGROUND AND JAL ALLEGATIONS

25 7. On December 30, 2020, Respondent CDFW certified a Final Environmental

26 Impact Report that had been made public on December 19, 2019.

27

28

2
VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

8. This certification was the most recent step in a restoration planning process that

2 began at least as early as 2004. That process and additional pertinent history of the Ballona

3 Wetlands is further detailed in the following paragraphs.

4 9. Most of the land which currently comprises the Ballona Wetlands Ecological

5 Reserve was formerly privately owned property.
10.
6 In 2003, the Wildlife Conservation Board, a state agency established by Sections
1320 - 1324 of the California Fish and Game Code approved the purchase of the Ballona
7 Wetlands using $139 million in public bond funds, $10 million of which came from Proposition
8 12, and the remainder of which came from Proposition 50.

9 11. On July 27, 2012, Respondent published a Notice of Preparation ("NOP") of a
10 Draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") for the Project (State Clearinghouse No.
11 2012071090).

12 12. Petitioner submitted scoping comments in response to the NOP on October 23,

13 2012.

14 13. On January 29, 2013, Respondent published a revised NOP to include the analysis

15 of a since abandoned proposal to construct a 46,000 square foot domestic animal care and
adoption facility in the ecological reserve.
16 14. Petitioner submitted additional scoping comments in response to the revised NOP
17 on March 15, 2013.
18 15. Respondent published a DEIR on September 25, 2017.

19 16. Petitioner submitted detailed comments on the DEIR on February 2, 2018.

20 17. Petitioner submitted additional comments on the DEIR as new information

21 became available between February 2, 2018 and December 19, 2019.

22 18. On December 19, 2019, Respondent published a Final Environmental Impact

23 Report ("FEIR").
19.
24 Between December 19, 2019 and December 30, 2020, Petitioner submitted
multiple comments and supporting evidence to Respondent for inclusion in the administrative
25 record.
26 20. On December 30, 2020, CDFW certified the FEIR and filed a Notice of
27 Determination with the State Clearinghouse.

28 21. Petitioner files this action within the statutory 30 day window.

VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act)

3 22. All of the above paragraphs are incorporated by reference as though set out at

4 length herein.

5 23. The EIR is a collection double standards, circular logic, fanciful thinking,

6 conclusionary and self-serving statements, glaring omissions of data and analysis, and vague,
factually unsupported assertions. As such, the EIR fails utterly as a good faith informational
7 document in violation of the California Environmental Quality Act, Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000 et
8 seq. (CEQA).

9 Pre-commitment to a desired outcome

10 24. Petitioner alleges that, over a decade before the certification of the final EIR, the

11 lead agency and its partners had wholly committed to a restoration alternative that would involve

12 massive re-engineering of the ecological site, to include alteration of the flood control levees and

13 removal of millions of cubic yards of soil from the project site.
25.
14 Petitioner alleges that all of the lead agency's actions subsequent to that pre-
commitment to large-scale re-engineering of the site were designed to achieve that
15 predetermined outcome, and that the lead agency actively avoided any analysis that could have
16 led objective decision-makers to choose a restoration alternative that did not involve such
17 massive re-engineering and resulting environmental impacts stemming therefrom.
18 26. Petitioner alleges that these actions included: establishing impermissibly narrow

19 project goals that would justify the elimination of otherwise reasonable restoration alternatives;

20 the use of double standards and fabricated rationales to dismiss reasonable alternatives and

21 mitigation measures; framing the "no project" alternative as one in which the ecological reserve

22 would remain in an impaired and neglected state; curtailing project communication and
transparency to avoid constructive and informed discussion of alternatives; and restricting access
23 to the site to prevent the public from effectively refuting assertions about baseline conditions.
24 Insufficient response to comments:
25 27. Under CEQA, the lead agency must provide sufficient written responses to
26 comments submitted during the EIR comment period. (Public Resources Code § 21092.5.)

27 Responses require good faith, reasoned analysis. (CEQA Guidelines § 15088(c).)

28

4
VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

- 28.

2 Petitioner alleges that the lead agency's responses to Petitioner's comments and

3 also to the comments of other organizations, including those of reviewing government agencies,
were lacking in good faith or reasoned analysis and were instead intended to sidestep or dismiss

4 legitimate concerns about environmental impacts, the lack of a reasonable range of alternatives,

5 and insufficient mitigation measures.
29.
6 Petitioner alleges that many of the lead agency's responses merely restated the

7 same language that the commenter had criticized as deficiently vague, misleading or incomplete.
30.

8 Petitioner alleges that the overwhelming majority of the lead agency's responses

9 were cursory, misleading, inaccurate, and/or conclusionary in nature, and that these deficiencies

10 in the lead agency's responses are too numerous to list individually.
31.

11 For example, and as noted elsewhere in this complaint, the lead agency rejected
recommendations from numerous commenters to provide greater protection for Belding's

12 Savannah Sparrow, arguably the most important wildlife species in the ecological reserve, by

13 requiring more evidence of the adoption of new habitat than observation of a single breeding pair

14 prior to destroying substantial existing habitat. In justifying its decision to ignore these

15 recommendations, the lead agency asserted, without evidence, that commenters misunderstood

16- the mitigation measure being criticized, and providing a conclusionary assurance that the

17 proposed measure was satisfactory. The lead agency expressly did not analyze whether requiring

18 higher thresholds for adoption of new habitat would be feasible or effective in mitigating a
broadly recognized risk of adverse impact to the sparrow.

19 32. Petitioner also offers as an example, also referenced elsewhere in the Petition, the

20 lead agency's disingenuous response to Petitioner's request for an analysis of the potential

•21 feasibility and effectiveness of augmented accretion as a means to protect critical wetlands

22 habitats from the threat of sea-level rise. Rather than providing a good faith response, the Lead

23 Agency referred to scattered vague references in the EIR that had been written in a different

24 context and which did not provide agencies or the public with any new information about the

25 potential of a mitigation measure that the lead agency admitted in its final EIR "showed
promise" but which it refused to meaningfully analyze.

26 Certification of the EIR was clearly premature

27 33. Certification of the EIR was premature because the lead agency has openly

28 acknowledged it has not completed its design planning.

5
VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

34. The EIR has no value as an actionable instrument without a corresponding

2 Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), the federal counterpart to CEQA's EIR, which must be
developed pursuant to the National Environmental Quality Act ("NEPA"). Petitioner alleges that

4 the lead agency is fully aware that if the federal lead agency, the US Army Corp of Engineers

5 (USACE), produces an EIS it will be so materially different to the EIR that it will necessitate the
EIS to be revised and recirculated.
6 35. Petitioner alleges that the lead agency's premature certification of the EIR will
7 lead to a substantial waste of resources for the state, the courts, other government agencies and
8 for the small non-profit organizations challenging the sufficiency of the EIR.

9 36. As such, Petitioner asks the Court to order that certification of the current EIR be

10 vacated in its entirety and that a revised Draft EIR which is aligned with the draft EIS, be

11 recirculated for public review and comment.

12 Flood control

13 37. Petitioner alleges that the lead agency reduced the informational value of the

14 document by intentionally glossing over a known discrepancy in its flood control calculations.
38.
15 Maintaining or improving the flood control capacity of the Ballona channel is a
core objective of the project, but the many assurances in the EIR that the project meets this
16 objective are unsupported or erroneous because the lead agency has been forced to admit that,
17 despite millions of dollars and years of studies, the detailed engineering schematics and technical
18 specifications in the draft EIR were based on a faulty calculation..

19 39. Petitioner alleges that plain reading of the DEIR would have led any reasonable

20 person to believe that those detailed engineering schematics and technical specifications, such as

21 the height, width, placement and composition of berms, had been designed to achieve a flood

22 conveyance standard of the required 68,000 cubic feet per second.
40.
23 However, Petitioner alleges that the lead agency intentionally worded the EIR to
hide this mistake in order to a leave readers with a false impression regarding this critical element
24 of the project. Specifically, Petitioner alleges that, despite the lead agency and its consultants
25 being fully aware at the time of publication of the DEIR that there was a substantial discrepancy

26 between the required flood conveyance capacity (68,000 cfs) and what the plans in the EIR were
27 designed to accommodate (only 46,000 cfs), the lead agency failed to produce an EIR that met

28 the informational requirements of CEQA on this issue..

6
VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

41. As a result of the EIR's failure as an informational document on this issue,

2 reviewing agencies and the public were deprived of the opportunity to comment on the issue.

3 Petitioner alleges that this subterfuge is especially concerning in light of comments from entities

4 such as the US Fish and Wildlife Service which expressed concern about the proposed new

5 levees and berms as designed in the DEIR, which are almost certain to have an even more severe
adverse impact when they are redesigned to accommodate that correct flood conveyance
6 capacity.
7 42. Plaintiff further alleges that the EIR contains many indefensible comparisons of
8 the environmental impact of different restoration alternatives with regard to flood capacity such
9 as the assertion on page 3.9-85 of the DEIR that "Alternative 4 would have a lower level of flood

10 protection than in the other alternatives." Petitioner alleges that the lead agency had no factual

11 basis to make this comparative assertion because it had not, and still has not, resolved the

12 discrepancy between its engineering design and what is required for the project.
43.
13 Plaintiff alleges that the lead agency's intentional omissions regarding its flood
control miscalculations constitutes an egregious violation of CEQA that prevented government
14 agencies and the general public from making informed comments about the environmental
15 impact of the project.
16 No reasonable range of alternatives
17 44. "Because an EIR must identify ways to mitigate or avoid the significant effects

18 that a project may have on the environment (Public Resources Code Section 21002.1), the

19 discussion of alternatives shall focus on alternatives to the project or its location which are

20 capable of avoiding or substantially lessening any significant effects of the project, even if these

21 alternatives would impede to some degree the attainment of the project objectives or would be

22 more costly." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.6(b)). A reasonable range of alternatives must be
analyzed. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.6(c)).
23 45. Petitioner alleges that the lead agency impermissibly limited the range of
24 alternatives to receive meaningful analysis to three action alternatives that would all cost over
25 $130 million, would all require the movement and/or disposal of over 3 million cubic yards of

26 soil, would all include alteration of the existing flood control channel, and which would all result

27 in the loss of critical wildlife habitat.

28

7
VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

- 46.

2 Petitioner further alleges that the lead agency impermissibly framed the "no
project" alternative as one that would provide no improvement to current conditions and which

3 would instead leave the ecological reserve in a largely impaired, neglected, and inaccessible

4 condition.

5 47. Petitioner alleges that a reasonable range of alternatives would have included at

6 least one alternative that did not involve massive engineering, and the acknowledged adverse

7 environmental impacts that such re-engineering would entail, in order to facilitate an informed

8 comparative analysis of the risk, cost, time to implement, greenhouse gas emissions, resilience to
sea-level rise and other aspects of the project.

9 48.

10 Petitioner alleges the lead agency was well aware that one of the most contentious

11 aspects of the proposed project was whether an alternative that is less expensive, less risky, and
less damaging to existing wildlife habitat could still achieve most of the broader goals of an

12 ecological reserve, which are to protect sensitive flora and fauna. However, Petitioner alleges

13 that, despite this clear awareness, the lead agency purposely refused to analyze any such

14 alternative, denying interested agencies and members of the public the opportunity to make

15 informed comparisons of such alternatives.
49.
16 As a result, all three action alternatives analyzed in the draft EIR called for

17 massive re-engineering of the site, creating "false choice" in which reviewers were misled into

18 believing that the ecological health and value to the community of the wetlands ecosystem could
only be improved via such large-scale re-engineering.

19 Lack of justification for dismissing other alternatives.

20 50. Petitioner also alleges that the lead agency's rationale for dismissing various

21 alternatives and components from a full analysis was an error of law, and/or not supported by

22 substantial evidence.

51.
23 Petitioner alleges that the lead agency purposefully framed Alternative 4 of the

24 EIR, i.e. the "no project" alternative", as one in which no new access would be allowed, even

25 though such access, along with basic restoration and trail improvements, would not require the
approval of a project pursuant to CEQA.

26 52.

27 Petitioner alleges that Alternative 4 was framed in this punitive manner for the
express purpose of essentially holding the ecological reserve hostage in exchange for public

28

8
VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 support of a project that the lead agency knows lacks broad public support due to its many

2 deficiencies.

3 53. Petitioner alleges that, in so doing, the lead agency intentionally reduced the value

4 of the EIR as an informational document by misleading the public into believing that public

5 access to a more than a small corner of the ecological reserve could only be possible after its
proposed large-scale reengineering of the land.
6 54. Petitioner also alleges that the lead agencies justification for designating
7 Alternative 1 as the environmentally superior alternative was vague, arbitrary, conclusionary and
8 otherwise insufficient and was subject to the failure to consider feasible mitigation measures to

9 protect critical wildlife habitat from the threat of sea-level rise as described elsewhere in this

10 Petition.

11 55. Petitioner also broadly alleges that the lead agency did not provide sufficient

12 justification for dismissing certain alternatives from receiving a full analysis.

13 Deferred mitigation
56.
14 The EIR impermissibly defers mitigation and therefore deprived reviewers of the
opportunity to comment on the effectiveness and enforceability of the deferred mitigation.
15 57. The incidences of the lead agency deferring mitigation by referring to mitigation
16 plans for which no details have yet been provided is too numerous to list individually in this
17 complaint. To establish the above described, pervasive pattern of the lead agency's deferral of
18 mitigation, Petitioner provides the below examples.

19 58. Concurrent with the certification of the EIR, the lead agency acknowledged that

20 "during the next design phase, CDFW will firm up potential sequences available to further divide

21 the project into smaller components. Having smaller components facilitates securing funding and

22 allows the restoration to pause, or even halt, and evaluate resource issues to ensure appropriate

23 protective actions and implementation of adaptive management." This cryptic language about
changes to the project during the "next design phase" raises substantial questions about how such
24 changes might adversely impact the environment. There has been no opportunity for responsible
25 agencies or public stakeholders to review and comment on any such changes because they have
26 yet to be completed or published. While Petitioner understands that a lead agency cannot be

27 expected to predict every detail of the project, and also that projects require some degree of

28 flexibility for adaptive management, the purpose of CEQA is defeated if lead agencies can

9
VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

H

2 simply respond to concerns about adverse environmental impacts with the type of conclusionary,
undefined and fanciful assurances as were provided in the Notice of Decision.

3 59. Petitioner alleges that the lead agency's failure to provide any discussion or

4 analysis regarding its planned changes to the project phasing and sequencing, and the lack of any
opportunity to review and comment on the potential impact of such changes, defeats the primary

6 purpose of CEQA, which is to facilitate informed decision making. The EIR expressly illustrates

7 that the project, if implemented, would set the wetlands on a path to virtually disappear by, or

8 soon after, 2100 due to the effects of sea-level rise. A wetlands restoration alternative that is

9 anticipated by the project's own designers to result in the eventual disappearance of the wetlands

10 cannot be said to be an environmentally superior option. Yet discussion of this severe

11 environmental impact of the project or potential mitigation measures was woefully insufficient.
The EIR did not sufficiently analyze any alternative methods to address sea-level rise, such as

12 the augmented accretion of sediment (also sometimes referred to as thin-layer sediment

13 augmentation) to gradually increase the elevation of marsh habitats to keep pace with sea-level
rise.
14 60.
15 In its comments to the DEIR, Petitioner urged the lead agency to analyze the

16 feasibility of this approach and provided links to relevant literature, such as a slide presentation

17 by the US Fish and Wildlife Service highlight use of this approach at Seal Beach and a paper on

18 this topic from the federal lead agency for the Ballona project, the US Army Corps of Engineers.
61.

19 Additionally, Petitioner alleges that more literature has been published since the
end of the comment period for the DEIR, such as a paper by the Southern California Wetlands

20 Recovery Project, co-authored by a Coastal Conservancy employee with a management role in

21 the Ballona Wetlands project, which highlighted augmented accretion as one management

22 technique included as part of SCWRP's regional strategy.
62.
23 While the Final EIR's response to Petitioner's comments on this issue asserted

24 that augmented accretion had been analyzed in the DEIR, the response cites only a single, vague

25 sentence that is referenced in an entirely different context (i.e. potential disposal options for

26 dredged sediments well after the completion of the project restoration). Petitioner alleges that the

27 lead agency's response to this request for analysis falls well short of the established threshold for
sufficient discussion of a substantial environmental impact and potential mitigation of that

28 adverse impact.

10
VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 63. While the instances of deferred mitigation are too numerous and pervasive

2 throughout the EIR to list them all individually, Petitioner preserves the right to challenge the

3 adequacy insufficient mitigation plans, such as the lack of a reviewable Sampling and Analysis

4 Plan, as discussed in comments submitted by the United States Environmental Protection

5 Agency, and the lack of a sufficiently detailed Adaptive Management Plan, as discussed in
comments submitted by the California Coastal Commission and the US Fish and Wildlife
6 Service and other agencies.
7 Wildlife

8 64. The EIR categorically fails to adequately discuss the adverse impacts of the
9 project to various wildlife and plant species. While deficiency applies to virtually every species

10 discussed in the EIR, and while Petitioner preserves the right to challenge the inadequacy of the

11 analysis of impacts to wildlife generally, specific examples of this general deficiency are

12 outlined below.

13 Belding's Savannah Sparrow
65.
14 The EIR openly acknowledges that the alternative approved by the lead agency
would destroy multiple acres of habitat for the Belding's Savannah Sparrow ('BSS"), which is a
15 California listed endangered species, including currently occupied habitat and potentially
16 suitable habitat.

17 66. Both critics and supporters of the proposed project alike agreed in their commentsl

18 to the draft EIR that the mitigation measures outlined for protecting Belding's Savannah Sparrow

19 were deficient, in that those measures only required documentation of a single breeding pair of

20 Sparrows in newly created habitat before permanently destroying existing habitat. For instance,

21 the California Coastal Commission stated in its comments that "the observation of a single

22 breeding pair [of BSS] in Area A is not adequate assurance that the local population will not be
adversely affected by the restoration.»
23 67. Petitioner alleges that the lead agency's response to these comments is woefully
24 deficient because the response failed to analyze or discuss whether the stronger measures that
25 were recommended by multiple commenters would or would not be feasible or effective in

26 protecting this endangered species. Instead, the lead agency merely suggested, without support,

27 that commenters has misunderstood the full extent of the proposed mitigation for this species.

28

11
VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

- 68.

2 The EIR also acknowledges that "[b]ecause Belding's savannah sparrows are
known to have high site fidelity, the establishment of new habitat does not guarantee future use."

3 (DEIR pg 3.4-99) Petitioner alleges that the destruction of existing Sparrow habitat without adoption

4 by the Sparrow of newly created habitat would constitute a severe environmental impact that would

5 be counter-intuitive and counter-productive to a habitat restoration project in an ecological reserve.

6 Yet, despite this acknowledged risk, the EIR provides no discussion or analysis of the extent of the

7 acknowledged risk, despite the presence of academic literature focused on the emigration habitats of

8 the Sparrow between potentially suitable habitats. Thus the reader of the EIR is left to guess at
whether the destruction of existing habitat prior to the creation of new habitat poses a remote risk or

9 a high risk that the project would result in a reduction of habitat for this critical species. As such,

10 Petitioner alleges that the EIR's discussion of this species fails to meet well established thresholds.

11 Additionally, the anticipated changes to habitats due to sea-level rise, shown on pages 2-147 to 2-

12 151 of the DEIR, appear to show a drastic loss of marsh habitat as a result of the project. This would

13 unquestionably impact multiple marsh-dependent species, including the endangered Sparrow, and

14 would seemingly result in the eventual extirpation of those species. Petitioner alleges that this
outcome would be directly counter to the stated objectives of the adopted Project, yet the lead agencyl

15 rejected Petitioner's request for a more informative analysis of this clear environmental impact.

16 69. To help the lead agency increase the informational value of the DEIR on this point,

17 Petitioner requested that information about the number of acres of currently occupied Belding's

18 Savannah Sparrow's habitat and potentially suitable habitat, similar to that contained in Table 3.4-9

19 of the DEIR, be provided to show how that habitat would decrease over time as a result of sea-level

rise.

20 70.

21 The lead agency chose not to include such information in the final EIR, but instead
merely quoted passages from the DEIR that acknowledge the reduction of marsh habitat over time

22 but which provide no information regarding the extent of future habitat loss for the Sparrow,

23 arguably the most critical species that the ecological reserve was established to protect.
71.
24 Petitioner alleges that the lead agency's own commissioned research with regard

25 to Belding's Savannah Sparrow (Zembal, 2010), as well as other research (auk0508.pdf) show

26 that this species struggles to survive in "narrow bands" of fragmented habitat, precisely what

27 appears to be the inevitable outcome of the project, whether by 2100 or soon thereafter.
72.

28 Petitioner alleges that it is an egregious violation of CEQA for a lead agency to
avoid directly addressing this impact.

VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

F Least Bell's Vireo

2 73. Petitioner alleges that, after publication of the Draft EIR and after the closing of

3 the public comment period, the lead agency became aware of the presence of breeding Least

4 Bell's Vireo within two areas of the project site that are slated to be cleared and grubbed and

5 regraded as part of the project.
74. In the Final EIR, the lead agency incorrectly claims that "the presence of least
6 Bell's vireo foraging and nesting activity . is restricted to the far southeast corner of Area B"
7 despite the lead agency being in possession of a report acknowledging Least Bell's vireo nesting
8 in other areas of the ecological reserve.

9 75. Petitioner alleges that the EIR's discussion of this species is too vague, general,
10 and incomplete to meet the required threshold for CEQA, especially because it did not address

11 the additional nesting observations in areas slated to be impacted by the Project.

12 Ridgway's Rail
76. 13 Petitioner alleges that the EIR's discussion of the potential reintroduction of this

14 species is vague, too general and therefore insufficient as a threshold matter.
77. a The discussion in the EIR is limited to a few scattered paragraphs and sentences
15 which only note the association between Ridgway's Rail and Cordgrass, and notes that
16 Cordgrass was not historically present at the Ballona Wetlands. There is no discussion of other
17 vegetation used by Ridgway's Rail, such as Pickleweed, no discussion or analysis as to why and
18 how the Rail became extirpated as a breeding species within the project site, no discussion as to

19 whether the Rail could be reintroduced as a breeding species without a wholesale re-engineering

20 of the site, and no discussion as to what factors would influence the lead agency's deferred

21 decision as to whether it would attempt reintroduction of the Rail as a breeding species as part of
the proposed project.
22 Aesthetics
23 78. Petitioner alleges that the lead agency and its consultants intentionally reduced the
24 informational value of the EIR by selecting Key Observation Points (KOP's) and camera angles
25 that would avoid acknowledgement of the project's severe impacts on site aesthetics.

26 79. Petitioner alleges that the lead agency is aware of the most iconic views of the
wetlands in that those views have been chosen as graphics for various project documents or other 27

28 agency records relating to the wetlands.

13
VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

] 80. For instance, the lead agency included a photograph on its own project web page

2 of a tidal channel in Area B of the wetlands looking south from the Ballona Creek toward Playa

3 del Rey. Petitioner alleges that the lead agency is fully aware that the view depicted in this

4 photograph is an iconic view and a well-known aesthetic viewpoint.
81. Petitioner further alleges that the restoration alternative adopted by the lead
agency would cause this tidal channel to be buried in fill in order to construct the West Area B
6 flood control levee and a paved bicycle trail.
82. In addition to short-term impacts to the aesthetics of the project site, Petitioner
8 also alleges that the EIR is deficient in that it does not discuss the long term impacts due to rising
9 sea levels, such as the permanent loss of the iconic salt panne (and therefore views of that salt

10 panne).

11 Unstable project description

12 83. Because the lead agency still has not indicated what flood conveyance capacity

13 will be met by the project, because it has indicated that it will re-evaluate project phasing and

14 sequencing, because it has acknowledged that more design work is needed, because the lead
agency waited until certification of the FEIR before adopting a preferred alternative, and for
15 many other reasons, the project description is not stable. Pursuant to CEQA, the public has a
16 right to review and evaluate an EIR with stable project description.
17 Parking lots

18 84. Petitioner alleges that two parking lots were created sometime in the mid to late

19 1980s on previously private land which is now part of the Ballona Wetlands Ecological Reserve.

20 85. Petitioner alleges that these two lots were built on land leased by the private land

21 owner at the time to two different departments of the County of Los Angeles: the Department of

22 Beaches and Harbors and the Sheriff's Department.
86. Petitioner alleges that the lead agency, the Department of Fish and Wildlife,
23 inherited these leases but had the absolute authority to discontinue them at any time.
24 87. Prior to the vote by the California Fish and Game Commission to designate the
25 land as an ecological reserve in 2005, and to adopt regulations for the ecological reserve, the lead
26 agency assured the Commissioners that the compatibility of the leased parking uses would be

27 analyzed during the environmental review process.

28

- 88.

2 Based on this assurance, the Commission adopted regulations which included a
provision that the leases could continue pending a decision by the lead agency that the land could

3 not be used for a more compatible use, such as restoration.

4 89. Petitioner alleges that, despite the lead agency's assurance that it would analyze

5 the compatibility of the leased parking lots, it never did so, and has never made any

6 determination as to whether there are more compatible uses for the land.
90.
7 Petitioner alleges that the lead agency never conducted any parking analysis,

8 despite requests from multiple commenters for such an analysis. Additionally, Petitioner alleges

9 that no alternative was analyzed which envisioned the removal or reduction of the lots despite

10 the president of the Fish and Game Commission urging the lead agency to do so during a public
hearing on the matter in December of 2017.

11 91. The EIR acknowledges that reducing the amount of pavement would have the

12 beneficial impact of providing more land available for restored habitat, yet this was only

13 considered in the context of creating a new parking structure in the ecological reserve, and was

14 not analyzed generally.
92.
15 The lead agency must conduct a reasonable parking analysis, including the

16 availability of parking outside of the ecological reserve, to determine whether, and to what

17 extent, the existing pavement in Area A could be eliminated or reduced, and converted to native

18 wildlife habitat, which is the purpose of the ecological reserve.
93.

19 Petitioner alleges that the lead agency violated CEQA by not conducting any
parking analysis to determine the parking needs for the ecological reserve and has instead

20 ignored requests for such studies and attempted to leave excess pavement in the ecological

21 reserve as a permanent feature without analyzing the impacts resulting therefrom.

22 Improper Baseline
94.
23 Petitioner alleges that the lead agency used the wrong baseline against which to

24 measure the environmental impacts of its adopted alternative.
95.
25 Petitioner alleges that the lead agency adopted management policies that severely

26 restricted public access, allowed invasive weeds to expand over most of the project site due to

27 general neglect, refused to explore other options for the land within the ecological reserve upon
which two leased parking areas are maintained for outside uses and then used the resulting

28

15
VERIFIED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF

F conditions to create an artificially low baseline. Petitioner alleges that a proper baseline would be

2 based on reasonably anticipated conditions that could be achieved without the Project.

3 96. Petitioner further alleges that the lead agency errantly suggested that the removal

4 of Southern California Gas Company infrastructure within the ecological reserve would be a

5 benefit of the project when the record shows that the Gas Company intends to remove that
infrastructure, contingent on the drilling of new wells just outside of the reserve, regardless of
6 restoration in order to achieve decreases in its operating costs.
7 Prayer for Relief
00 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as follows:

9 (i) A peremptory writ of mandate compelling the lead agency, California Department
10 of Fish and Wildlife, to set aside and vacate its certification of the Final EIR for the Ballona

11 Wetlands Restoration Project;

12 (ii) For an order enjoining CDFW from developing or altering the site in any way that

13 may have an adverse environmental impact without first obtaining lawful approval of an

14 adequate EIR;
(iii) Costs of suit;
15 (iv) Reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to Civil Procedure Code section 1021.5;
16 (v) Such other and further relief as is just and proper.
