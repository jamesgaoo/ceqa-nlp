VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

a0A0D- Petitioner, Coalition for An Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park, alleges:

Introduction
1. By this action, Petitioner, Coalition for An Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park
challenges the unlawful actions of the City of Los Angeles, its Planning
Department, and its City Council, (collectively, the City) to approve the
7 development of, and to adopt a CEQA Categorical Exemption for project (the

8 Project) proposed to be constructed at 1047-1053 South Fedora Street in the City

9 of Los Angeles (Project Site).

10 2. The Project was determined to qualify for the City's Transit Oriented
11 Communities Affordable Housing Program (TOC). The TOC is codified in Los
12 Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC) § 12,22.A 31. The City approved Guidelines
13 under this program pursuant to a ballot measure known as Measure JJJ, the
14 "Affordable Housing and Labor Standards Related to City Planning" Initiative.
15 However, in adopting the Guidelines, the City exceeds the authority granted by
16 voters in enacting Measure JJJ. The City's reliance upon these improper
17 Guidelines constitutes an improper policy and practice of ignoring the voter's
18
19 mandate in Measure JJJ, and leads to the City disregarding the proper legislative
858883884 25 procedures for amending the General Plan and the zoning ordinances.
3. The approval of the Project is also inconsistent with the General Plan Framework
Element and the mitigation measures adopted for the General Plan Framework
because the Project, and other projects approved in reliance on the TOC
Guidelines, are approved without any finding and substantial evidence that the
City's infrastructure is adequate and capable of supporting the level of
development in the Project area and all other similar projects being approved in
reliance on the TOC Guidelines throughout the City,

29 4. The City abused its discretion in approving the Project and related environmental
documentation, as described above.
30
31 Parties

32 5. Petitioner Coalition for an Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park (the Coalition) is
33 an unincorporated association whose members include individuals residing and
34 working in the vicinity of the Project. The Coalition brings this action on behalf
35

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-Nmv of the public. Members of the Coalition have a beneficial interest in a this case
because the actions being taken by the City, and challenged in this case, affect
them directly as neighbors of the Project and members of the public at large. The
Coalition is aggrieved by the Project for the reasons set forth below in this
un petition.
6 6. Respondent City of Los Angeles (City) is a charter city and municipal
7 corporation and is responsible for regulating and controlling land use in the
8 City's territory, including but not limited to implementing and complying with
9 the provisions of CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, other California laws , and its
10 General Plan. The Los Angeles City Council (City Council) is the City's 11 legislative body. The Los Angeles Planning Department (Planning Department)
12 is a unit of City government having jurisdiction over certain land-use approvals
13 within the City. Respondent City is the lead agency for purposes of Public 14 Resources Code § 21067, with principal responsibility for conducting
15 environmental review for and approving the Project.
16
17 7. Real Parties in Interest, Joe Englanoff and 1047 Fedora LLC are, on information

18 and belief, the legal and equitable owners of the Project Site and the Applicant

19 for the entitlements being challenged in this case (Applicant).
20 8. Petitioner is currently unaware of the true names and capacities of respondents 21 1888 and defendants Does 1 through 10, and therefore sues those parties by such
fictitious names. Does through 10 are agents of the Respondent and Real Party
in Interest who are responsible in some manner for the conduct described in this
25 petition, or other persons or entities who claim some legal or equitable interest in
8GGA the subject matter of this action. Petitioners will amend this petition to show the
true names and capacities of Does 1 through 10 when such names and capacities
become known.

Jurisdiction and Venue
30 9. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this petition under Code of
31 Civil Procedure (CCP) §§1085 and 1094.5, Pub. Res. Code $§ 21167, 21168,
32 and 21168.5.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

L
N m v 10. is This case is properly classified as an unlimited civil case, and therefore within
the jurisdiction of this Court, because it is not one of the types of cases listed as
limited civil cases in CCP §§ 86, 86.1 or 87.

5 11. Venue is proper in this Court under CCP § 394 because the Respondent City of §

6 Los Angeles is a local agency with territory wholly within Los Angeles County,

7 which is where the Project's environmental effects will be felt.

8
9 12. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to filing this action,

10 including exhaustion of all administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

11 Petitioner and/or other agencies and individuals raised each of the legal

12 deficiencies asserted in this petition orally or in writing during the Respondent's
decision-making process.
13
14 13. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

15 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondent to

16 set aside its certification of the Project and environmental documents. In the

17 absence of such remedies, Respondent's decisions will remain in effect in

18 violation of the state law and injurious to Petitioner.

MUSUNNULDO The Project
14. The Project at issue in this case involves the proposed construction of a new SIX-
story, 75-foot high mixed-use building with 58 residential units. The proposed
building will have 36,309.6 square feet in total floor area, resulting in a Floor
Area Ratio (FAR) of approximately 4.5:1. The Project proposes to provide 21
automobile parking spaces on one subterranean level and one ground floor level.
The project will also provide 36 automobile parking spaces and 49 bicycle stalls.
15. The Applicant applied for Project entitlements on August 26, 2019.

29 16. On March 25, 2020, the Los Angeles Director of Planning issued a Director's

30 Determination adopting a class-32 CEQA categorical exemption for the Project

31 and approving the following Project Entitlements:

32
33 a. Transit Oriented Communities (TOC) Affordable Housing Incentive

34 Program with the following three base incentives: Residential Density

increase of 66%; floor area ratio of 4.5:1 in the R4-1 Zone; automobile N m ta parking that does not exceed 0.5 automobile parking spaces per unit

b. The following additional two incentives: reductions in front, rear and side
yard set backs; maximum 25 percent reduction in open space.
In support of the Project Entitlements, the Director adopted Conditions of
7 Approval and Findings.
8

9 17. The Project was determined to qualify for the City's TOC program. Pursuant to
10 this qualification, the Project received certain "incentives." This project received
11 the following TOC incentives for a "qualifying Tier 3" project: (1) a 66 percent
12 increase in density; (2) an increased floor area ratio of 4.5:1; (3) reduced required
13 parking of 0.5 spaces per unit. Additionally, the Project, requested and received
14 two additional incentives: (1) a reduction in set backs for front, side and rear

15 yards; (2) and a maximum reduction of 25 percent in the required amount of
The Project, thus, received a total of 5 incentives. 16 open space.

17 18. On April 9, 2020, Petitioner appealed the Director's Determination that the 18 Project qualified for a CEQA Categorical Exemption. 19
858840884 19. On September 17, 2020, the City Council's Planning and Land Use Management
(PLUM) Committee, after holding a public hearing, voted to recommend that the
City deny the Petitioner's appeal and approve the Categorical Exemption for the
Project.
20. 0n October 14, 2020, the City Council adopted the recommendation of the
PLUM committee, denying the appeal and approving the Categorical Exemption
for the Project.

First Cause of Action 29 Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
30 21. Coalition for an Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park incorporates 11 1-20 as
31 though set forth herein.
32
33 22. In approving the Categorical Exemption for the Project, the City violated the
California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code §§ 21000-21189.3 34
35

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

(CEQA) and the CEQA Guidelines (14 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 15000-15387 plus
0 mv0to0 appendices) in significant ways, which are described in the following paragraphs.
23. On March 25, 2020, the City approved a class-32, "infill development project"
categorical exemption for the Project. However, under CEQA Guidelines 302
15332(a), in order to qualify for the exemption, the Project must be "consistent
with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan
policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations." The
Project does not meet the applicable requirements because the City failed to 9 provide substantial evidence of adequacy for utilities and public services. 10
a. There is substantial evidence in the record of inadequate infrastructure 11
and emergency services due to the influx of projects - many of them TOC 12
projects- approved and proposed for the area without environmental 13 analysis. There is substantial evidence in the record that utilities and 14
services are inadequate for The Project due to the cumulative effects and 15
unusual circumstances created by the influx of projects approved, and in
the pipeline, for the area in such a short time span without a 16
17
corresponding increase in infrastructure, emergency services, utilities and 18
public services to support the influx of projects. 19 283883 b. Under the City's General Plan Framework mandatory mitigation measure
Policy 3.3.2, inadequate infrastructure and emergency services preclude
discretionary increases in intensity of development. A project is
ineligible for a Class 32 exemption unless it is consistent with all general
plan policies and zoning regulations. The project is not consistent with 25 the Wilshire Community Plan required findings of adequacy for
infrastructure, traffic, emergency and other public services. 8& 24. CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2(b) contains exceptions that apply to the Project and
29 therefore prohibit the use of a categorical exemption in this case:
30 a. Cumulative Impacts: There are numerous other approved housing 31 projects in the vicinity of the Project, which contribute towards 32 significant air quality, traffic, and noise impacts. The Project's 33 contribution to these impacts is cumulatively considerable. 34

b. Unusual Circumstances: A categorical exemption shall not be used for an
A0N J 0 ao activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a
significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances - the
unusual circumstances being the influx in projects approved and proposed
for the area in such a short time span, many of them TOC projects
approved and proposed without proper environmental analysis

Second Cause of Action
Violation of Measure JJJ 9
10 25. Coalition for an Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park incorporates 11 1-24 as
though set forth herein. 11
12 26. Under Section 7 of Measure JJJ, "any aggrieved person or resident of the City of
13 Los Angeles shall have the right to maintain an action for equitable relief to
14 retrain any violation of this Ordinance. The provisions of this Act shall be
15 construed liberally to effectuate its intent and purposes.
16
17 27. On November 8, 2016, voters in the City of Los Angeles approved a ballot
measure known as Measure JJJ. The ballot title of this measure was "Affordable 18
Housing and Labor Standards Related to City Planning." The measure was titled 19
20 by its proponents as "The Build Better LA Initiative."
688 28. Measure JJJ contains Section 6, which is titled "Transit Oriented Communities
Affordable Housing Overlay." Section 6 establishes Los Angeles Municipal
Code § 12.22. A 31, which is titled "Transit Oriented Communities Affordable 24 Housing Incentive Program."
25
26 29. Section 6 establishes a program for housing and developments within a one-mile
radius of a Major Transit Stop, as defined in Public Resources Code section 27 21155, subdivision (b). As set forth in Section 6, "Each one-half radius around a 28 Major Transit Stop shall constitute unique Transit Oriented Communities 29 Affordable Housing Incentive Area." 30
31 30. Section 6 (Los Angeles Municipal Code section 12.22 A 31 (b)) provides that
32 within 90 days of enactment, the Director of Planning "shall prepare TOC
33 Affordable Housing Incentive Guidelines ("TOC Guidelines") that provide the
34 eligibility standards, incentives, and other components of this TOC incentive
35

- 6 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-
2 program descried herein." Measure JJJ provides that "[t]he TOC Guidelines shall

0 7 10 0 be drafted consistent with the purposes of this Subdivision and shall include the
following" standards regarding eligibility and incentives.
31. Measure JJJ Section 6 provides that "an Eligible Housing Development" shall be
granted TOC incentives, as determined by the Department of City Planning

7 consistent with residential density increase and reduced parking. LAMC § 12.22

8 A.31 allows up to three specific ministerial incentives (FAR and density

9 increases, and reduced parking). This project received the following TOC

10 incentives for a "qualifying a Tier 3" project: (1) a 66 percent increase in density;

11 (2) an increased floor area ratio of 4.5:1; (3) reduced required parking of 0.5

12 spaces per unit.

13
14 32. Measure JJJ Section 6, however, does not authorize the additional incentives

15 granted to the Project. The "additional discretionary" incentives granted to this

16 project were never approved by the voters. The Project received two additional

17 incentives, which exceed the scope authorized by Measure JJJ. In approving

18 these additional incentives, the City acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner

SUSHEHNHSE and violated both the directive of the voters in enacting Measure JJJ and the
requirements of state law and municipal code.
33. The Project's incentives are based on a tier system created by the City's adoption
of the TOC Guidelines instead of the Project's base zoning and density approved
as is required by LAMC § 12.22 A.31 and the voter-approved language of
Measure JJJ. The TOC Guidelines improperly provide for "additional" incentives
for reduction in required yards and setback, open space, and lot width; increasés
in maximum lot coverage, height, and transitional height requirements. Each of
these "additional" incentives circumvent otherwise applicable limitations in the

29 municipal code without complying with the procedural requirements for zone
changes, height district amendments and general plan amendments or variances -

30 procedures which are meant to provide due process and full transparency.

31
32 34. The additional incentives granted for the Project violates LAMC §12.22.A31; as

33 such the Project is ineligible for a Class 32 exemption since in order to qualify

34 for such exemption, the Project must comply with all zoning and general plan
policies and regulations.

Re: Coalition For an Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park v. City of Los Angeles et. al. Case No: 20STCP03817

To the Attorney General of the State of California,
Please take notice that on November 18, 2020, this firm, on behalf of its client, Coalition for
an Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park, filed a petition for writ of mandate against the City of Los
Angeles, the Los Angeles City Council, and the Los Angeles Department of City Planning
(collectively, "City"). This letter provides the notice of lawsuit required by Public Resources Code
section 21167.7 and the Code of Civil Procedure section 388.
The Petition alleges that the City violated the California Environmental Quality Act, Public

on the environment without the environmental review required by CEQA. The project at issue is
located 1047 to 1053 Fedora Street, Los Angeles, CA, 90006 and consists of a proposed 50-unit
residential building. A copy of the petition is included with this notice.
