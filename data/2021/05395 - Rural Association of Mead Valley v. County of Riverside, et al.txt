VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Petitioner, RURAL ASSOCIATION OF MEAD VALLEY (*Petitioner" or "RAMV"),

2 alleges through this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate (*Petition"), as follows:
INTRODUCTION 3

1. Petitioner challenges the adoption by Respondent County of Riverside ("County"
or "Respondent") of a Mitigated Negative Declaration and related discretionary approvals
(together, the "Project Approvals") for the Harvill and Rider Warehouse Project (*Project"). As
noted below, the County failed to follow the required procedures required by the California
Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") when it adopted the Mitigated Negative Declaration for
the Project. The failure to follow these procedures was prejudicial in that it precluded informed
10 decision-making. Moreover, implementation of the Project will have substantial adverse impacts
on the environment. 8 Channel Law Group, d17 LiZ06 The Project involves the construction and operation of one (1) approximately

15 and trucks, one (1) water quality detention basin, and associated improvements.
16 3. The County of Riverside's approval of the Project and Mitigated Negative
17 Declaration for the Project must be vacated because the MND fails to comply with CEQA in a
18| number of important ways, including that the County failed to adopt all feasible mitigation and
19 alternatives for significant impacts. The decision to approve the Project without imposing all
20 feasible mitigation and alternatives is contrary to CEQA's "substantive mandate" that the lead
21 agency shall not approve a project with significant impacts where feasible mitigation or
22 alternatives exist to reduce the impacts. Moreover, the Mitigated Negative Declaration is
23 deficient in numerous ways and fails to adequately address and mitigate the significant
24| environmental impacts of the Project.
25 4. During the administrative review process, numerous interested parties notified the
26 County that there was need for further analysis and mitigation due to the Project's adverse

6 Declaration for the Project on October 5, 2021. The Riverside County Board of Supervisors also
approved a Plot a Plan and Change of Zone. Petitioner requests that the Court vacate the Project
8 Approvals because Respondent failed to comply with the provisions set forth under the
9 California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA"),

CEOA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public
3

implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental 32.

5 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires
7 governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects 6

of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
9 otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with 8

10 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
33. CEQA is California's broadest environmental law and helps to guide public 8 d17 'dnoJo MET jeuueuo -1Z06 SIl!H 3408 VPINE EUSIAM EB CE 3everly 12 agencies such as the County during issuance of permits and approval of projects. Courts have
13 interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest protection of the environment within the reasonable scope
14| of the statutes. CEQA applies to all discretionary projects proposed to be conducted or approved
15 by a County, including private projects requiring discretionary government approval. See
16 California Public Resources Code, sections 21000 - 21178, and Title 14 Cal. Code Regs., section

22 declaration to the public, responsible agencies, trustee agencies, and the county
23 clerk...sufficiently prior to adoption…to allow the pubic and agencies the review period
provided under Section 15105." They also require the lead agency to send a copy of the negative

§ 1 project." Id. § 15073(c). Additionally, CEQA requires submission of copies of a negative
declaration or Mitigated Negative Declaration to the State Clearinghouse, including in situations
where a State agency has jurisdiction with respect to the Project and where the Projects is of
4 statewide, regional, or area wide significance. Pub. Code § 21082.1(c)(4). CEQA also requires

sent Petitioner's counsel a notice of public hearing for the hearing that was originally set for
September 14, 2021. The County clearly failed to 'engage in the outreach to individuals and
entities that were interested in the project.' The County submitted the MND to the State
Clearinghouse on August 3, 2021 but completely failed to notify Petitioner of the submittal to the

6 State Clcaringhouse or the new "local public review period" that ended on September 2, 2021.
The County never sent copies of the Notice of Completion to RAMV or Petitioner's counsel,
Channel Law Group. As a result, the County failed to comply with Executive Order N-54-20 and
CEQA.

24 prejudicial (among other reasons) because the failure to comply with the law resulted in a
25 subversion of the purposes of CEQA by preventing citizens from being able to comment on the

8 have a significant effect on the environment even when there are arguments to the contrary. As
9 explained below, Petitioner has presented a fair argument supported by substantial evidence that
10 the project will have a significant impact on the environment and therefore an Environmental

Beverly 'SI!!H 14 State Clearinghouse. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW") provided
15 comments, recommendations and revisions to mitigation measures and new mitigation measures
16 for the Project. The Staff Report prepared for the Project indicated that the County has
17 incorporated these suggested revisions. However, the Staff Report failed to note that CDFW also
18 stated as follows: "The comments and recommendations are also offered to enable the County to
19 update the MND to adequately disclose impacts and measures for CDFW and the public to
20 review and comment on the proposed Project with respect to the Project's compliance with Fish

22 CEQA, recommended that the MND be revised to disclose the impacts and proposed CDFW
23 measures and that the public be given a new opportunity to review and comment on the Project.
24 However, the County refused to recirculate the MND as required by CEQA Guidelines Section
25 15073.5. The County argued that the CDFW recommended mitigation measure pertaining to

62. The Project Will Result in Significant Geology and Soils Impacts. RAMV

3 submitted an expert report from Walker Consultants, Ltd. This report demonstrated that the
MND is defective and fails to mitigate the Project's impacts a to a level of insignificance. The
5 report states as follows:

"[T]he report does not mention the need to excavate and re-compact the backfill soil in
the two underground storage tank (UST) excavations which extend to an estimated depth 12 feet below ground surface (bgs). This estimated 12-foot depth is considerably deeper than the grading over-excavation which will only extend to 5 to 8 feet bgs.
The report provides only one cursory mention (Appendix D, page 2) regarding the need 10 to properly clean-out/remove/abandon septic systems under county permit. It is unlikely
1 that the septic systems, particularly the scepage pit(s), have been removed and/or properly abandoned during site demolition. If there was past improper disposal of
12 hazardous wastes into the septic system then the removal/abandonment may be more -VZ06 extensive and complicated and may involve the USEPA. 13 8 0gL enS "pAja 8383 Wilshire d11'dnoJ5 MET [euueys The report does not mention the need to continuously observe for presence of

15 construction, particularly regarding the former UST systems, the septic systems, beneath the corn-only feeder, beneath the storage shed and beneath the loading dock."
16

63. The report from Walker Consultants, Ltd. Clearly demonstrated that the
18 environmental analysis undertaken by the County was deficient and that new mitigation 17

19 measures are required to reduce significant impacts associated with the Project.

20 64. Further, the project site contains alluvial soil that is not well suited for building.

21 This soil must be removed and new soil added. The Geotechnical Investigation Report that was

22 conducted by the County states "the fill soils are not considered suitable for the support of the
new structure. The recommended remedial grading should also remove any existing fill materials
24 from the proposed building pad area." Appendix E1 - Geotechnical Investigation Report, Page 23

25 1). Approximately 28,000 cubic yards of imported fill soil is required. However, the air quality
26 analysis that was performed by the County did not take into consideration the impacts of this
27 hauling. Import and export of fill dirt requires a large number of haul trucks. The number of

20 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 hours for equipment used to import and export the fill dirt was not included in the County air
quality analysis. The MND is therefore inaccurate because it understates the impacts of the
3 Project and shows no imported fill needed.
4 65. Additionally, the MND erred when it concluded that "all runoff generated will be
directed to the south and [] will gravity flow into a bio-retention basin designed to be located
near the southwestern corner of the site along with an engineered outlet structure. Water quality
flows will be fully captured by the basin and the runoff would be filtered through the bio-
8 retention basin media before being pumped into the engineer outlet structure." However, the
southwest corner of the project site is not suited for a water quality basin. The MND at Appendix
10 E2, page 5. states: "Hard pan soil in the southwestern portion of the site where the detention
basin is located. Based on low infiltration rates that location is not suitable. The detention basin ® d77 'dnoJo MET |euueyo -LZ06 1L06VPAE  S A B OO SIH Aueseg. 13 function." Further, there is only one basin outlined in the approved plans. Moreover, the MND at 12 must be located in the southeastern portion of the site. The current basin location will not

non-existent in the Southwestern portion of the site where the water quality basin is located." 14| Appendix
15

16 Even though this was included in the Geological Report the retention basin is still located in the
17 Southwestern corner of the Project site. The MND's conclusions were clearly flawed and not
18 supported by substantial evidence - the water quality detention basin for the Project will not
19 function as designed and must be relocated.
20 66. The County Failed to Adequately Consider Cumulative Impacts, The CEQA
21 Guidelines define cumulative impacts as "two or morc individual effects which, when considered
22 together, are considerable or which compound or increase other environmental impacts." 14 Cal
23 Code Regs §15355. The individual effects may be changes resulting from a single project or
24 more than one project. 14 Cal Code Regs §15355(a). Cumulative impacts may result from
25 individually minor but collectively significant projects taking place over a period of time. 14 Cal
26 Code Regs §15355(b). A cumulative impact is an impact created by the combination of the

present, and probable future projects. 14 Cal Code Regs $§15065(a)(3), 15130(b)(1)(A),

8. 2021 (Plot Plan No. 190032 & CEQ190121). This project is located approximately 118 feet 67. Notably, the County approved another warehouse and distribution facility on June

associated with such away from the instant Project. The distance between the two warehouses buildings is just 200
feet. Despite the acknowledged significant environmental impacts
10 facilities, the County failed to adequately consider the cumulative impacts of this Project.
According to the MND conducted by the County for the other warehouse facility, "[c]onstruction § d11 'dnoJo MET |uueyO -LZ06 12
