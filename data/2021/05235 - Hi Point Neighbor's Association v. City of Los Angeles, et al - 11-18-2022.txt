8 state and local laws and was premised on incentives improperly awarded pursuant to an
9 improperly approved set of guidelines.

16 The Project was approved by the City Planning Commission of the City of Los Angeles.
Petitioner requests that the Court vacate the Project Approvals because Respondent failed to

19 Resources Code section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA"), the State Planning and Zoning Law, and local
20 laws and therefore failed to proceed in a manner required by law.
21 4. Petitioner seeks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under California Code of Civil
22 Procedure section 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate, rescind and set aside all Project

PARTIES 1

2 5. Petitioner, HI POINT NEIGHBOR'S ASSOCIATION, is an unincorporated
3 association dedicated to the protection of both the community and the environment of the
residents of Hi Point Street. Petitioner and its respective members have a direct and substantial
5 beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondent complies with laws relating to protection of the

6 public health, safety and welfare. Petitioner and its respective members are adversely affected by
7 Respondents' failure to comply with state and local law in approving the Project. Petitioner has

8 standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because Petitioner and its members' aesthetic
9 and environmental interests are directly and adversely affected by Respondent's' approval of the
10 Project. Petitioner's members participated in the approval process for the Project, appealing the
11 decision of the Director of Planning and submitting written comments to the Planning 8 d77 'dnoJo MeT jauueyo -IZ06 AA0  7PMNIET H SIR A ES SO 'SILH Kueneg 12 Commission during the appeal. Petitioner's members also appealed the environmental
13 determination to the City Council and submitted written comments to both the Planning and
14 Land Use Management Committee ("PLUM") and City Council during the appeal process.
15 Respondent and Defendant, CITY OF LOS ANGELES (the "City"), is charter
16 city incorporated under the laws of the State of California. The City is the lead agency under the 6.

17 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").
18 7. Respondent and Defendant, HI POINT M, LLC ("Real Party") is the applicant
true names and capacities of additional 19 and developer of the Project. Petitioner is ignorant of the
20 Real Parties sued herein as DOES 1-25, inclusive, and therefore sues these Real Parties by such
21 fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of
22 fictitiously named Real Parties in Interest. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges
23 that each Respondent designated berein as a DOE has some responsibility for the events and

10. Venue for this action properly lies in the Los Angeles Superior Court because
Respondent and the Project are located in Los Angeles County pursuant to Code of Civil
8 Procedure § 394.
FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

Project 10

11 11. The Project consists of the demolition of one (1) existing single-family residential 8 d77 *dnoJo MET jeuueua LZ06 12 structure, and the construction, use, and maintenance of a new (5) five-story, 57-foot-high multi-

8 euns "PAjA EJJyS|M £888 13 family residential building with 20 dwelling units over one (1) level of subterranean parking.
Beverly Hills 14 12. Surrounding properties are generally developed with commercial, single-family
15 residences, and multi-family residential uses. Properties abutting the subject site to the west are
16 zoned [Q]R3-1-0 and improved with three- and four-story apartment buildings. Properties to the
17 east across Hi Point Street are also zoned [Q]R3-1-0 and developed with one- to four-story
18 single-family homes, condominiums, and small lot buildings. Properties to the north are zoned
19| [Q]R3-1-0 and C4-1-0, and include both single-family and multi-family residential structures as
20 well as a McDonald's Drive-Thru restaurant and a commercial strip mall. Properties to the south
21 across Saturn Street are zoned [Q]R3-1-0 and R1R3-RG-O, and include a mix of single-family
22 residences and multistory apartment buildings.
23 13. The project site is a single interior lot consisting of approximately 8,839 square
24 feet of lot area. The subject property is rectangular-shaped and has a street frontage of
25 approximately 52 feet along the westerly side of Hi Point Street, with an approximate depth of

3 26 170 feet. The subject site is located within the Wilshire Community Plan Area and is zoned

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 a [Q]R3-1-O with a corresponding land use designation of Medium Residential. The "Q" Qualified
2 Condition, established pursuant to Ordinance Number 168,193, limits the building height to 35

3 feet, requires articulation at every 30 feet for building facades exceeding 40 feet (minimum depth
4 of façade modulation is five feet), and prohibits balconies above the first floor which have a line

5 of sight to adjacent existing single-family uses. Ordinance 168,193 provides for additional

6 regulations that are applicable to the project as well.

7 14. On December 30, 2021, the Director of Planning adopted a determination of the
applicability of the Transit Oriented Communities Affordable Housing Incentive Program (the
9 "Letter of Determination") and found that the Project qualified for a categorical exemption from
10 CEQA.
11 15. In the Letter of Determination, Department of City Planning staff approved a 8 Channel Law Group, d71 -1Z06 LTAS VPE  SINA E 'SIlIH Aueneg 12 building height for the Project of 57 feet, instead of the 35 feet required by the applicable [Q]
13 Condition, as a Tier 3 project under the Transit Oriented Communities ("TOC") Affordable
14 Housing Incentive Program.
15 16. The Determination Letter for the proposed development, dated December 30,
16 2020, stated that "the project site is located within a Tier 3 Transit Oriented Communities
17 Affordable Housing Incentive Area, qualified by its proximity to the intersection of a Major
18 Transit Stop. The project site is located within 750 feet of the intersection of one Rapid Bus
19 Lines (Metro Rapid Line 780) and one Regular Bus Line (Local Line 7) at the intersection of
20 Pico Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue."
21 17. In the Letter of Determination, the Director also approved a 25 percent reduction
22 in required open space under the TOC Affordable Housing Incentive Program.
23 18. In January 2021 members of Petitioner, and owners and residents adjacent to the
24 Project, timely appealed the approval and environmental determination to the City Planning
25 Commission as provided for by the Los Angeles Municipal Code. Multiple appeals were filed.
26 Among other things, the appellants argued that the Project did not comply with the TOC
27

u 28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Affordable Housing Initiative Program, with the [Q] Conditions under Ordinance No. 168,193,
2 and that Department of City Planning staff erroneously determined that the Project was exempt
3 from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines, Section 15332, Article 19 (Class 32).

19. The City Planning Commission held a hearing on the appeal. The City Planning

5 Commission denied the appeal, sustained the determination to approve the Project as a Tier 3
6 TOC Affordable Housing Incentive Area, and reaffirmed that the Project was exempt from
7 CEQA. A written letter of determination was issued on April 13, 2021.
8 20. On or about April 22, 2021, members of Petitioner filed two appeals of the CEQA

9 determination to the Los Angeles City Council pursuant to Public Resources Code Section
10 21151(c). The City scheduled a public hearing for the appeal before the Planning and Land Use
11 Management Committee (the "PLUM") for August 31, 2021. PLUM recommended that the City
4LZ06 12 Council deny the appeal. Petitioner objected to the Project on the grounds that the City had failed
13 8 OAA BynS "PAJE EJJySIIM €8€8 'dnoug MET |euueu) to comply with CEQA and adopted the arguments that had been presented by Petitioner's
'SIlIH Auexeg 14 members. On or about September 15, 2021, the City Council adopted PLUM's recommendation.
15 On or about October 6, 2021, a Notice of Exemption ("NOE") was filed with the County
16 Recorder for the Project
TOC Guidelines 17

18 21. On November 8, 2016, City of Los Angeles voters approved Measure JJJ. The
19 ballot question for Measure JJJ read:
20 Shall an ordinance: 1) requiring that certain residential development
21 projects provide for affordable housing and comply with prevailing wage,
22 local hiring and other labor standards; 2) requiring the City to assess the
23 impacts of community plan changes on affordable housing and local jobs;
24 3) creating an affordable housing incentive program for developments
25 near major transit stops; and 4) making other changes; be adopted?
26 22. The Chief Legislative Analyst for the City prepared an impartial analysis of
27

6 28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Measure JJJ, which explained that Measure JJJ "creates an affordable housing incentive program

2 with increased density and reducer parking requirements in areas within a one-half mile radius

3 around a major transit stop."

4 23. Measure JJJ's definition of a Major Transit Stop takes its definition from
5 subdivision (b) of Section 21155 of the California Public Resources Code which in turn takes its
6 definition from Section 21064.3 of the CPRC which states "Major transit stop... means a site
7 containing…the intersection of two or more major bus routes with a frequency of service interval
8| of 15 minutes or less during the morning and afternoon peak commute periods."
9 24. Section 6 (Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC) § 12.22(A)(31)(b) provides that
10 within 90 days of enactment, the Director of City Planning "shall prepare TOC Affordable

8 11 Housing Incentive Program Guidelines (the "TOC Guidelines") that provide the eligibility d17 'dnoJg MET ¡auueyO •1Z06 8383a Wishife A CA Suze 12 standards, incentives, and other necessary components of this TOC incentive program described
13 herein." Measure JJJ required that the "[t]he TOC Guidelines shall be drafted consistent with the
'SI!H Áueneg 14 purposes of this Subdivision and [that the TOC Guidelines] shall include [)" standards regarding
15 eligibility and incentives.
16 25. According to the City of Los Angeles's Technical Clarifications to the Transit
17 Oriented Communities Affordable Housing Incentive Program Guidelines, Notes for Map 1,
18 page 6, "confirmation of the correct Tier shall take place at the time a TOC application is
19 accepted by the Department of City Planning. As transit service changes, eligible TOC Incentive
20 Areas may be modified."
21 26. As adopted by the City Planning Commission, the TOC Guidelines depart from
22 the parameters and requirements of Measure JJJ in multiple respects.
23 27. Measure JJJ provides that the TOC Guidelines may allow different levels of
24 density increases based upon base zone and density, but the TOC Guidelines utilize a system of
25| Tiers based on the distance from a Major Transit Stop. Under the TOC Guidelines, the Tiers
26 allow for different levels of density increases, regardless of the base zone or density of a specific
27

7 28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Ipiece of property.

3 "consistent with the following" which include a residential density increase, adjustments to 2 28. Measure JJJ also provides that TOC Guidelines must contain incentives

4 square feet per dwelling unit, floor area ratio, or both, as well as parking reductions.
The TOC Guidelines included additional incentives for reductions in yards and setbacks, open minimum

6 space, lot width, maximum lot coverage, height, and transitional height requirements. Each 5

7 additional incentive alters the otherwise applicable development standards in the municipal code
8 without complying with the procedural requirements for zone changes, height district

9 amendments, or general plan amendments and variances.
10 CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

11 29. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public 8 d77 'dnoig Me ] |euueus L1Z06 13 implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the 12 agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental

8 uNS "PAJE BJJUSI!M 8888 'SI!H Áuexeg 14| decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
15 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires
16 govemnmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects

18  otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with 17 of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that

19 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
20 30. The primary function of an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") is to discuss the
21 important environmental consequences of the project, including cumulative effects, and to
and the general public with mitigation measures and alternatives to the
23  project that would have Jess serious environmental consequences. Under CEQA lead agencies, 22 provide the agency

24 such as Respondent, are required to prepare complete and legally adequate EIR prior to
approving any discretionary project that may have a significant adverse effect on the
26 environment. The EIR must fully disclose and adequately analyze the project's potentially 25

28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 significant environmental effects. CEQA also requires lead agencies, such as Respondent, to

3 and/or alternatives, determine whether proposed mitigation measures will be effective in 2 consider mitigation measures and alternatives to a project, adopt all feasible mitigation measures

avoiding or substantially lessening the project's significant environmental impacts, and to make

5 adequate findings, including an adequate statement of overriding consideration for those

6 significant environmental impacts deemed unavoidable.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 7

8 (VIOLATION OF LOCAL ZONING: As Applied Challenge to TOC Guidelines)
(Code of Civ. Proc., § 1085 and 1094.5)
10 31. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
11 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein. d77 'dnoJg MET jeuuey: 32. 1706 12 As applied to the Project, the TOC Guidelines are unlawful because they grant 1 0 PIET M SIM  ES CO 13 incentives that are contrary to Measure JJJ and the requirements of the Los Angeles Municipal
S|H Áueneg 14 Code.
15 33. Measure JJJ authorizes incentives for density increases and parking, but does not
16 authorize incentives for increased height, reduced open space, or reduced side or front yards.
17 Voters adopted Measure JJJ with the understanding that projects under the TOC Affordable
18 Housing Incentive Program would provide density increases and reduced parking requirements.
19 34. Among other things, the City granted a 25 percent reduction in the required
20 amount of open space for the project. However, while the TOC Guidelines authorizes the grant
21 of such incentives, they are defective and unlawful as applied to this project because Measure JJJ
22 never authorized open space incentives. Open space is simply not included as an incentive or
23 concession in Measure JJJ. In any event, as explained below, even if you apply the 25 reduction
24 in open space, the Project still does not meet the Q Condition's open space requirements due the
25 specific criteria outlined in the Ordinance for "common open space."
26 35. The TOC Guidelines depart from the framework approved by voters and overturn
27

9 28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 the development standards adopted by the Los Angeles City Council through "tiers.' By
2 allowing increasing density with proximity to transit, the TOC Guidelines effectively create new
3 zones, which are not authorized by the general plan or Measure JJJ.

4 36. The TOC Guidelines are so wide reaching for land use in the City of Los Angeles
5 that they effectively constitute an amendment of the general plan, but the TOC Guidelines were

6 not adopted consistent with a general plan amendment, or even by the City Council. By allowing

7 for increased height and other incentives not provided for in Measure JJJ, Respondent has
8 effectively rendered the general plan amendment moot, creating inconsistencies within the
0 general plan in violation of state law. (Gov. Code, sec. 65300.5.)
10 37. In approving this Project, Respondent has violated its own laws by application of
11 the TOC Guidelines.
4 ®
B}INS "PALE BIJYSIIM €888 12 38. In adopting TOC Guidelines inconsistent with Measure JJJ, the City Planning Channel Law Group, LLZ06 13 8 Department and City Planning Commission abused their discretion and adopted TOC Guidelines
SIH Áueseg 14 in an arbitrary and capricious manner. As applied to this project, the TOC Guidelines are void.
15 For this reason, the general plan, Wilshire Community Plan, and [Q] conditions applicable to the
16 Project are not overridden by the TOC Guidelines.
17 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
18 (VIOLATION OF LOCAL ZONING LAW: Project Inconsistent with TOC Guidelines)
19 (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1085 and 1904.5)
20 39. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
21 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
22 40. The Project is not consistent with the TOC Affordable Housing Incentive
23 Program, as adopted, and is not consistent with the applicable zoning, adopted to ensure
24 consistency with the General Plan and the Wilshire Community Plan.
25 41. Judicial review in actions brought for violation of CEQA is generally limited to
26 the administrative record. Extra-record evidence may be admissible in cases where the facts are
27

10 28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

in dispute and the administrative record is not adequate for judicial review without extra-record
2 evidence. Western States Petroleum Ass'n v. Superior Court (1995) 9 Cal.4th 559, 575. If the
lead agency provides the opportunity for members of the public to review the CEQA documents
4 prepared for the project, to comment, present evidence, and subject objections, and the agency 3

5 makes its decision in the record, judicial review should be confined to the record.

6 42. The TOC Guidelines, as adopted, permit eligible projects within Tier to increase

7 floor area ratio ("FAR") by 50%, while permitting eligible projects within Tier 2 to increase
8 FAR by 45%. In order to award a project with Tier 3 status under the TOC Guidelines, the
9 Director of City Planning must find that the project is "within 1,500 feet of a major Transit stop
10 consisting of two rapid bus routes."
11 43. In the Letter of Determination, the Director of City Planning found that "the 8 d71'dnoJ9 ME7 |3UUEYO •LZ06 12 project site is located within a Tier 3 Transit Oriented Communities Affordable Housing

8 eyins "PALE BJJySI!M E888 13 Incentive Area, qualified by its proximity to the intersection of a Major Transit Stop. The project
'SII!H Áuerg 14 site is located within 750 feet of the intersection of one Rapid Bus Lines (Metro Rapid Line 780)
15 and one Regular Bus Line (Local Line 7) at the intersection of Pico Boulevard and Fairfax
16 Avenue."
17 44. The project is neither located within the requisite distance, nor do the cited bus
18 lines meet the requisite frequency service intervals. By the City's own method of measuring
19 distance, as stated in the TOC Guidelines, this site is not located within 750 feet of the Pico and

Furthermore, using the City's own methodology as shown in Appendix A of the 20 Fairfax intersection.

22 TOC Guidelines, at the time the project was accepted for review in December 2020, the Metro 21 45.

23 Rapid Line 780 did not offer a frequency of service interval of 15 minutes or less during the
24 morning and afternoon peak commute periods in either direction.
25 46. The frequency of service interval for Rapid Line 780 is 21 minutes in the
26 eastbound direction and 22 minutes in the westbound direction. Both are greater than 15

11 27

28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 minutes, the amount required by the definition of a major transit stop.
2 47. In response to the appeals filed, the City claimed in its Appeal Recommendation

3 Report ("Appeal Recommendation Report") that the subject property is located within a Tier 3
4| TOC area not because it was within 750 feet of the intersection of one Rapid Bus Lines and one
5 Regular Bus Line but because it was within 1500 feet of "the intersection of two rapid bus routes

6 (Santa Monica Big Blue Bus Rapid 7 Line, Metro Rapid Line 780, and Metro Rapid Line R7)."
7 However, the Metro Rapid Line R7 does not exist. The City mistook it for the Santa Monica Big
8 Blue Bus Rapid 7 Line which it had already mentioned.
9 48. In addition, the City claimed in its Appeal Recommendation Report that "the
10 definition of a Major Transit Stop was subsequently clarified through City Planning on August
11 19, 2020 to apply only to transit schedules in place as of March 17, 2020." Even under this new
-+Z06 0944 euns "pAjgi Channel Law Group, 12 definition, according to the timetable that was in effect on that date, Metro Rapid Line

8 13 780 still does not offer a frequency of service interval of 15 minutes or less during the morning
'SIl!H AjeAg 14 and afternoon peak commute period.
8383 Wilst 15 49. Rather than stand by its findings in its original Determination Letter - that the
16| project is within 750 feet of the intersection of one Rapid Bus Line and one Regular Bus Line, 11 the City then claimed the project is qualified by its proximity to a Major Transit Stop involving
18 the intersection of two rapid bus routes within 1500 feet of the site. Given Metro Rapid Line
19 780's failure to meet the requisite headways, this claim is false.
20 50. The only way a bus line along Fairfax could meet the requisite 15-minute
21  frequency of service interval is if the City aggregated the frequency of service intervals of
22 multiple bus lines along Fairfax Avenue-a fact not mentioned by the City in its Determination
23 Letter nor its Appeal Recommendation Report.
24 51. At the Los Angeles City Planning Commission Meeting in response to the appeals
25 City Planning Staff stated ".in any case, there's Santa Monica Big Blue Bus 7, Big Blue Bus
26 R7 intersecting with Local Line 217 and Metro Line Rapid 780, so that was the qualification that
27

12 28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 was determined February 27[, 2020] before COVID and that would still stand today."

2 52. This instance was the first time City Planning Staff explicitly stated that Metro
3 Line 217 and Metro Rapid Line 780 were used to justify Pico Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue's
status as a Major Transit Stop. The only other mention of Line 217 in the City's 228-page
Appeal Recommendation Report was a handwritten notation.

6 53. The City apparently combined the Metro Rapid Line 780 and the Metro Line 217,

7 | neither of which meet the 15-minute frequency of service interval required, into a single bus
8 route with a frequency of service of 15 minutes or less as required by the definition of a Major
9 Transit Stop.

10 54. However, the TOC Guidelines cite "SCAG and OPR Methodology" in

® 11 determining the number of trips that occur during peak period. In SCAG's own Transit Technical d77 dnoJ5 ME7 (auueuo -IZ06 3AR MPNE H SISA ES S8 'SIIH Aueneg 12 Report for Connect SoCal (2020-2045 Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable Communities
13 Strategy), it states "separate but overlapping bus routes that do not individually meet the 15-
14 minute threshold may not be combined in order to qualify as a [corridor with fixed route bus
15 service with service intervals no longer than 15 minutes during peak commute periods]
16 [emphasis added]." Neither the Metro Rapid Line 780 nor the Metro Line 217 meet the 15-
17 minute threshold on their own and they may not be combined in order to qualify as a major bus
18 route with service intervals no longer than 15 minutes. As such the Pico Boulevard and Fairfax
19 Avenue intersection cannot be considered a Major Transit Stop.
Even if the Project was located in Tier 3 incentive area, the project is still not 20 55.

21 consistent with the TOC requirements. Section V.4 of the TOC Guidelines provide:
22 Design Conformance. Projects seeking to obtain Additional Incentives
23 shall be subject to any applicable design guidelines, including any
24 Community design guidelines, Specific Plan design guidelines and/or
25 Citywide Plan design guidelines and may be subject to conditions to meet
26 design performance. The conditions shall not preclude the ability to

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 construct the building with the residential density permitted by Section VI
2 [i.e. base incentives] (emphasis added).
3 56. The applicable [Q] condition for the Project provides development standards,
4 including a 35-foot height limitation and specialized requirements for open space. The Project
5 does not comply with the requirements of the applicable [Q] conditions.

57. The applicable Q Condition for the Project requires minimum of 100 square feet
of "usable open space" be provided for each dwelling unit. Ordinance No. 168,193 lays out clear
8 criteria for what can be considered "usable open space." The project's proposed open space does
0 not meet these criteria. For example, the Q conditions require that private open space have a
10 horizontal dimension of at least 15 feet in width. Yet, a number of the patios and balconies on the

8 11 first habitable level do not meet the Q Condition's 15-foot in width requirement. Additionally, Channel Law Group, d17 •+Z06
8 aung "PALE eJJySi!M €888 12 the "garden" does not meet the Q Condition's requirement that "common useable open space"
13 bave an average width of 20 feet with width no less than 15 feet at any point. Additionally, the Q
'SIIH Áueneg 14 Conditions require a minimum of 50 percent of the common usable open space areas be planted
15 in ground cover/shrubs or trees. The proposed project includes 1,542 square feet of common
16 usable open space. However, the project only proposes to landscape only 602 square feet of the
17 common usable open space. This is less than required by the Q ordinance.
18 58. Additionally, the project does not conform to the Q Condition's requirement that
19 a covenant be recorded detailing all the information contained in the Q Ordinance.
20 59. Further, there is no evidence that the applicant has consulted with the Southern
21 California Gas Company regarding feasible energy conversation features that can be
22 incorporated into the design of the project. This is a requirement of the Q Conditions.
23 60. For these reasons, even if the TOC Guidelines can be lawfully applied to the
24 Project in question, Respondent acted arbitrarily and capriciously by granting Tier 3 incentives,
25 and additional incentives for height and open space in conflict with the applicable [Q] condition.

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
(VIOLATION OF CEQA: Improper Adoption of Exemption)
3 (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1094.5)

61. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
5 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

62. Respondent improperly concluded that the Project qualified for a Class 32
7 categorical exemption under CEQA. Respondent abused its discretion and failed to act in a

8 manner required by law.
9 63. The Class 32 categorical exemption is subject to five exceptions relating to plan
10 and zoning consistency (14 Cal Code Regs § 15332(a)), size and location of the site (14 Cal
11
9 8 Code Regs 15332(b)), habitat value (14 Cal Code Regs § 15332(c)), significant impacts (14
12 Cal Code Regs § 15332(d)), and utilities and public services (14 Cal Code Regs § 15332(e)). Channel Law Group, •+Z06 13 8 EjInS "pAJE BJJYSI!M €888 64. To qualify for a Class 32 categorical exemption, a project must be consistent with
'SIIIH Áueneg 14 the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies, in addition to any
15 applicable zoning designations and regulations. 14 Cal Code Regs § 15332(a).
16 65. As explained above, the TOC Guidelines are void ultra vires as applied to the
17 Project, and even if the TOC Guidelines were not, the Project is not eligible for Tier 3 incentives
18 for density, or the additional incentives for height or open space. Accordingly, Wollmer v. City of
19 Berkeley (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 1329 is not applicable in determining whether the Project is
20 consistent with the applicable general plan and zoning for the purposes of a Class 32 categorical
21 exemption (holding it proper to apply the provisions of state density bonus law (DBL) when
22 determining whether a project is consistent with otherwise inconsistent general plan and zoning
23 designations).
24 66. The TOC Guidelines make abundantly clear that under the TOC Affordable
25 Housing Incentive Program, projects "shall be subject to any applicable design guidelines,
26 including any Community Plan design guidelines, Specific Plan design guidelines, and/or City-
27

15 28

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

wide Design Guidelines and may be subject to conditions to meet design performance."

2 67. The Project is not consistent with the development standards specified in the [Q]

3 conditions, Wilshire Community Plan, or General Plan Framework. The Project is also not
consistent with the TOC Guidelines.

5 68. To qualify for a Class 32 categorical exemption, a project must not result in any
6 significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality. 14 Cal Code Regs §
7 15332(d). The project is not consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all
8 applicable general plan policies as well as with the applicable zoning designation and
regulations, and therefore does not comply with CEQA Guidelines Section 15332(a). Petitioner
10 explained the project's inconsistences in multiple letters to the City during the course of the

8 11 administrative approval process. In addition, the Project would result in significant construction Channel Law Group, d11 LIZ06 12 noise impacts and air quality impacts requiring mitigation, and therefore does not comply with

8 OunS "PALa BJ!HSI!M €888 13 CEQA Guidelines Section 15332(d), which precludes use of a Class 32 Exemption for projects
SIIIH Áuexeg 14 that would result in significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality.
15 Again, Petitioner explained the noise and air quality impacts in detailed letters submitted to the
16 City during the course of the administrative process. In addition, it is not clear that the site can be
17, adequately served by all required utilities and public services, and thus does not comply with
18 CEQA Guidelines Section 15332(e). Moreover, the project is not eligible for a Categorical
19 Exemption pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Sections 15332(b) and 15332(c) due to both impacts
20 associated with unusual circumstances and the potential for cumulative impacts.
21 69. Respondent abused its discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by
22 law when it adopted the Class 32 categorical exemption.
23 NOTICE OF COMMENCEMENT OF PROCEEDING
24 70. On July 12, 2021, prior to filing this Petition, Petitioner, through its counsel,
25 served the City with notice of Petitioner's intention to immediately commence a proceeding
26 against Respondent for violation of local zoning law in connection with the Project. AOn
27

VERIFIED FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

November 10, 2021, prior to filing this amended Petition, Petitioner, through its counsel, served

2 the City with notice of Petitioner's intention to immediately amend the petition to add a cause of
action against Respondents for violation of CEQA in connection with the Project. A copy of

4 these two letters providing such notice is attached to this Petition as Exhibit A. This letter
5 satisfied Petitioner's duties under Public Resources Code section 21167.5.

6 71. On July 12, 2021, Petitioner, through its counsel, served the California Attorney
General with notice of the commencement of this lawsuit, together with a true and correct copy
of this Petition. On November 10, 2021, Petitioner, through its counsel, served the California
9 Attorney General with notice of the amended petition adding a CEQA cause of action. Copies of
10 such notices are attached hereto as Exhibit B. Such notices satisfy Petitioner's duties under

R 11 Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and California Code of Civil Procedure, section 388. d11 'dnoJg MET jouueyo •IZ06 'SIl!H KUeAa 8se .a Vellshra StvCa Suze 12 PREPARATION OF THE RECORD

13 72. Pursuant to Public Resources Code, section 21167.6(b)(2), Petitioner elects to
14 prepare the record of proceedings in this action. Concurrently with this Petition, Petitioner is
15 filing a notice of its election to prepare the administrative record. A copy of that election is
