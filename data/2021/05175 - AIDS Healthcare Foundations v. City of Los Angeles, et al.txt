3 Introduction

4

5 1. This action challenges and seeks to enjoin the action of the City of Los Angeles,

6 Los Angeles City Council ("City Council"), and Los Angeles Department of City

7 Planning (collectively, "City" or "Respondents") on December 8, 2020, and all

8 subsequent actions certifying an environmental impact report ("EIR") (No. ENV-

9 2014-4706-EIR) for land-use entitlements including a Vesting Zone Change and

10 Height District Change, a Site Plan Review, a Master Conditional Use Permit for

11 on-site sales and consumption of alcoholic beverages, a Vesting Tentative Tract

12 Map (No. VTT-73718-1A), and other related actions ("Project Entitlements") for
the 6220 Yucca Street Project (the "Project").

13
14 2. The Project will demolish 40 existing rent-stabilized residential units and construct

15 a mixed-use development that includes a 30-story tower. There will be up to 269

16 multifamily residential units and approximately 7,780 square feet of

17 commercial/restaurant uses, with two single-family residences to the east of the

18 tower. The Project site is located within the Hollywood Community Plan area of
the City of Los Angeles.

19

20 3. Of the 269 multifamily units, only 17 are planned to be affordable units. The vast

21 majority of the multifamily units, although planned to be subject to the Los

22 SUN Angeles Rent Stabilization Ordinance ("RSO"), will be market-rate units. The
Project entails demolition of existing affordable RSO units and displacement of
their occupants, many of them long-term residents of the buildings to be destroyed.

25 4. The Project involves a vesting tentative tract map and haul route, in addition to a

27 zone change, a height district change, a density bonus compliance review, a master
conditional use permit (for sale and dispensing of alcohol for on-site

28 consumption), a conditional use permit (for live entertainment and dancing), and a

29 site plan review, as well as other discretionary and ministerial permits and
approvals.

30
31 5. The Project is located at 1756, 1760 North Argyle Avenue and 6210-6224 West

32 Yucca Street in Los Angeles.

33 6. In approving the Project, the City violated the California Environmental Quality

34 Act, Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA") and the CEQA

35 Guidelines, California Code of Regulations, title 14, sections 15000-15387 plus
appendices ("CEQA Guidelines"); and the Subdivision Map Act, Government

3 7. The City abused its discretion in approving the Project and related environmental

4 documentation, as described below.

5 Parties

6 8. Plaintiff and Petitioner AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a California nonprofit public
7 benefit corporation ("AHF" or "Petitioner"), is a nonprofit organization in Los 8 Angeles whose mission is to rid the world of AIDS through a network of
9 pharmacies, thrift stores, healthcare contracts, and other strategic partnerships; 10 generating new, innovative ways of treatment, prevention, and advocacy. There is 11 a significant relationship between health outcomes and access to safe, affordable 00529 3 housing. People with HIV are less likely to be able to stay adherent to their
medications and more likely to become sicker and more infectious when they lack
stable housing and/or are homeless. AHF operates the Heathy Housing
Foundation, which provides affordable housing to hundreds of very low-income
people and people at risk of homelessness in Los Angeles. AHF and the Health
Housing Foundation also advocate for lawful and transparent land use policy,

19 affordable housing and against gentrification. Petitioner, its employees,
customers, and the many persons whom Petitioner serves are beneficially 20 interested in and will be impacted by the outcome of this Project.
21
22 9. Defendant and Respondent City of Los Angeles is a California charter city located

23 in the County of Los Angeles, California. The Project is within the jurisdictional

24 limits of the City.

25 10. Defendant and Respondent Los Angeles City Council is the elected governing

26 body of the City and is the body responsible for the decision being challenged

27 herein.

28 11. Defendant and Respondent Los Angeles Department of City Planning is an agency

29 of the City responsible for developing, applying, and enforcing state and local

30 land-use and zoning laws within the jurisdictional limits of the City.

31 12. Defendants and Respondents Does 1-10 are entities of which the true names and
32 capacities are unknown to Petitioner at this time. Petitioner therefore sues said
33 Respondents by fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this petition to show the
34 true names and capacities of Does through 10 when ascertained.
35

3

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 13. Petitioner is informed, believes, and on that basis alleges that Real Party in Interest
2 Riley Realty, LP, (the "Applicant") is a California limited partnership that is the
3 owner of the Project Site and is the applicant to the City for the Project's vesting
4 tentative tract map, and other associated entitlements. Riley Realty, LP was
5 identified as the project applicant in the Notice of Determination filed by the City
6 for this Project.
7 14. Real Parties in Interest Roes 1-10 are entities of which the true names and
8

9 capacities are unknown to Petitioner at this time. Petitioner therefore sues said

10 Real Parties in Interest by fictitious names. Roes 1 through 10 are agents of

11 Applicant who are responsible in some manner for the conduct described in this

12 petition, or other persons or entities who claim some legal or equitable interest in

13 the subject matter of this action. Petitioner will amend this petition to show the

14 true names and capacities of Roes 1 through 10 when ascertained.

15 Jurisdiction and Venue
16 15. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and section 1085 and Public
17 Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5, and 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction
18 to issue a writ of mandate to set aside Respondents' decision to certify the EIR and
19 purported approval of the Project.
20
21 16. Venue is proper in this Court because the Project lies entirely within the County of

22 Los Angeles and the environmental impacts of the Project will be acutely felt in

23 this County. Pursuant to CCP § 393, venue is proper because the cause alleged in

24 this petition, or some part of that cause, arise in this county. Venue is also proper

25 in this Court pursuant to CCP §§ 394 (actions against a city, county, or local

26 agency), and 395 (actions generally), since the City of Los Angeles is in the

27 County of Los Angeles.

28 17. This petition is timely filed within 30 days after Respondents' decision to issue a

29 Notice of Determination in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.

30 18. This case is properly classified as an unlimited civil case, and therefore is within
31 the jurisdiction of this Court, because it is not one of the types of cases listed as
32 limited civil cases in CCP sections 86, 86.1, or 87.

33 19. Petitioner has provided written notice of its intention to file this petition to
34 Respondents in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5.
35

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

-
2 20. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant

3 action and has exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law

4 under Public Resources Code section 21177. Petitioner and/or other agencies and

5 individuals raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition orally or in

6 writing during the Respondents' decision-making process.

7 21. The violations by Respondents as alleged herein have affected the beneficial

8 interests of Petitioner and/or its supporting members. The relief sought by way of

9 this Petition will redress this beneficial interest and the likelihood of future injury

10 and interference with Petitioner's interests, and those of its supporting members

11 and residents of the City of Los Angeles.

12 22. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
13 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate and injunctive relief to
14 15 require Respondents to set aside its certification of the Project and environmental
documents. No amount of monetary damages or other legal remedy can
16 adequately compensate Petitioner for the irreparable harm that Petitioner, its

17 supporting members, and the residents of the City of Los Angeles will suffer from

18 the violations of law described herein. In the absence of such remedies,

19 Respondents' decisions will remain in effect in violation of state law and injurious

20 to Petitioner, its supporting members and residents of the City of Los Angeles.

21
22 Environmental Leadership CEQA Challenge

23 23. The Project was certified by the Governor as a leadership project a under Public

24 Resources Code sections 21182-21184 and is subject to Rule 3.2223 and other

25 associated rules of court.

26 24. Notice is hereby provided that RPI, as the entity that applied for certification as a

27 leadership project, must, if the matter goes to the Court of Appeal, make the

28 payments required by Public Resources Code section 21183, subdivision (f).

29 25. Petitioner hereby requests that Respondents prepare the administrative record, as
30 required by Los Angeles Superior Court Rule 3.232 and Public Resources Code
31 section 21167.6(a).
32
33 Statutory Framework

34 California Environmental Quality Act
35 26. Passed in 1970 as a state counterpart a to the National Environmental Policy Act, the

5

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") requires state and local agencies
2 to identify the potentially significant environmental impacts of their actions, and
3 then to avoid or mitigate those impacts if feasible.
4

5 27. CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its

6 proposed actions in an environmental impact report (except in certain limited
circumstances). See, e.g., Public Resources Code ("PRC) section 21100 et seq.
7
8 The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. (Dunn-Edwards v. BAAQMD (1992) 9

9 Cal.App.4th 644, 652.) "The 'foremost principle' in interpreting CEQA is that the

10 Legislature intended the act to be read SO as to afford the fullest possible protection

11 to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." (Cmtys.

12 for a Better Env't v. Cal. Resources Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.)

13 28. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision

14 makers and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a

15 project. (CEQA Guidelines § 15002(a)(1).) "Its purpose is to inform the public

16 and its responsible officials of the environmental consequences of their decisions

17 before they are made. Thus, the EIR 'protects not only the environment but also

18 informed self-government.3 (Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors

19 (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.) The EIR has been described as "an environmental

20 'alarm bell' whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to

21 environmental changes before they have reached ecological points of no return."

22 (Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay v. Bd. of Port Comrs. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th

23 1344, 1354.)

24 29. Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage

25 when "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all

26 feasible mitigation measures. (CEQA Guidelines § 15002(a)(2) and (3); Citizens of
27 Goleta Valley, supra, 52 Cal.3d at 564.) The EIR serves to provide agencies and
28 the public with information about the environmental impacts of a proposed project

29 and to "identify ways that environmental damage can be avoided or significantly

30 reduced." (CEQA Guidelines § 15002(a)(2).)

31 30. The required CEQA environmental review involves both substantive and

32 procedural steps. Public participation plays an important and protected role in the
33 CEQA process. (Laurel Heights Improvement Association v. Regents of the
34 University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392 ["The EIR process protects not
35 only the environment but also informed self-government"]; Concerned Citizens of

0- 2 Costa Mesa, Inc. v. 32nd District Agricultural Association (1986) 42 Cal.3d 929,

3 936 [members of the public have a "privileged position" in the CEQA process].)

4 "Each public agency should include provisions in its CEQA procedures for wide

5 public involvement, formal and informal, consistent with its existing activities and

6 procedures, in order to receive and evaluate public reactions to environmental

7 issues related to the agency's activities." (CEQA Guidelines § 15201.) The lead

8 agency must consider all "comments it receives a on a draft environmental impact

9 report, proposed negative declaration, or proposed mitigated declaration." (PRC

10 21091(d)(1); CEQA Guidelines § 15074(b).)

11 31. Procedurally, a lead agency may not approve a project until the public has been

12 given a full and adequate opportunity to participate and comment on the project.

13 32. CEQA also disallows approval of a project that fails to comply with other laws. A

14 lead agency may not approve a project with significant unavoidable impacts unless
15 it is "otherwise permissible under applicable laws and regulations." (PRC

16 § 21002.1(c).)

17 33. Recirculation of an EIR prior to certification is addressed in PRC § 21092.1 and
18 CEQA Guidelines § 15088.5. "When significant new information is added to an
19 environmental impact report after notice has been given pursuant to Section
20 21092…but prior to certification, the public agency shall give notice again
21
22 pursuant to Section 21092 and consult again pursuant to Sections 21104 and 21153
before certifying the environmental impact report." (PRC § 21092.1.)
23
24 34. "Significant new information" includes a disclosure showing that:

25 (1) A new significant environmental impact would result from the project or

26 from a new mitigation measure proposed to be implemented.

27 (2) A substantial increase in the severity of an environmental impact would

28 result…...

29 (3) A feasible project alternative or mitigation measure considerably
30 different from others previously analyzed would clearly lessen the significant

31 environmental impacts of the project....

32 (4) The draft EIR was so fundamentally and basically inadequate and

33 conclusory in nature that meaningful public review and comment were

34 precluded.

35 (CEQA Guidelines § 15088.5; Mountain Lion Coal. v. Fish and Game Comm'n

7

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

LO 070000 0 RN (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1043.)
35. In Laurel Heights Impr. Assn. Reg. of Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal. 4th 1112, 1130
("Laurel Heights II'), the Supreme Court explained that PRC section 21092 favors
EIR recirculation prior to certification. The Court stated:
Section 21092.1 was intended to encourage meaningful public comment.
[Citation omitted. ] Therefore, new information that demonstrates that an EIR
commented upon by the public was so fundamentally and basically

10 inadequate or conclusory in nature that public comment was in effect

11 meaningless triggers recirculation under section 21092.1.

12 Subdivision Map Act

13
14 36. The Subdivision Map Act, Government Code § 66410 § et seq. ("Subdivision Map

15 Act" or "Act"), requires local agencies to review and approve all land

16 subdivisions. The Act regulates the process for approving subdivisions and sets

17 substantive requirements for approval of land subdivisions.

18 ANNLSO 37. The Act requires that a local agency deny approval of a land subdivision, referred
to as a tentative map or a parcel map, if it makes any of the following findings:
"(a) That the proposed map is not consistent with applicable general and specific
plans.... (b) That the design or improvement of the proposed subdivision is not
consistent with applicable general and specific plans. (c) That the site is not
physically suitable for the type of development. (d) That the site is not physically

25 suitable for the proposed density of development. (e) That the design of the
subdivision or the proposed improvements are likely to cause substantial

26 environmental damage or substantial and avoidably injure fish or wildlife or their

27 habitat. (f) That the design of the subdivision or type of improvements is likely to

28 cause serious public health problems. (g) That the design of the subdivision or type

29 of improvements will conflict with easements, acquired by the public at large, for

30 access through or use of, property within the proposed subdivision...." (Gov.
Code, § 66474.)

31
32
33 Private Attorney General

34 38. This proceeding involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public

35 interest. Issuance of the relief requested in this petition will confer a substantial
benefit on the public, including citizens, residents, businesses, and taxpayers of the

8

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

-
2 City, and will result in the enforcement of important public rights by requiring

Ud Respondents to comply with CEQA and other legal requirements applicable to the

4 proposed Project; by voiding the Project approvals and prohibiting Respondents

100000 and Real Parties in Interest from taking further actions with respect to the Project
until it has complied with those legal requirements; and by prohibiting
Respondents from undertaking any portion of the Project until they have fully
complied with these legal requirements.

10 39. Petitioner is entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided in Code of Civil
Procedure section 1021.5 if it prevails in this action. The necessity and financial

11 burden of enforcement of these public rights entitle Petitioner to an award of

12 reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to that section.

13
14 Statement of Facts

15 40. On November 15, 2015, the City published a Notice of Preparation of an

16 Environmental Impact Report for the originally proposed project.

17 41. The Draft EIR was issued on April 23, 2020, in Environmental Case No. ENV-

18 2014-4706-EIR. The original project included 210 residential units in two

19 buildings, one 20 stories and one 3 stories, and 136 hotel rooms and 12,570 square

20 feet of commercial/restaurant uses in the 20-story building. The EIR included
21 consideration of various alternatives, including Alternative 2, Primarily

22 Residential Mixed-Use, which would increase the residential units to 271 units,

23 eliminate hotel rooms, and reduce the commercial/restaurant floor area to 5,120

24 square feet, but still include two buildings.

25 42. On August 7, 2020, the City released the Final EIR. The Final EIR included a

26 Modified Alternative 2 to address concerns over impacts to a historic district. The

27 Modified Alternative 2 eliminates the hotel component and the 3-story building,

28 includes 269 residential units and approximately 7,780 square feet of

29 commercial/restaurant uses, and increases the 20-story building to 30 stories.

30
31 43. On August 19, 2020, a joint public hearing was held before the Deputy Advisory
Agency and a Hearing Officer on behalf of the City Planning Commission, to
32
33 consider the entitlement requests for the originally proposed project and for

34 Modified Alternative 2. Following the hearing, in Case No. VTT-73718, the

35 Deputy Advisory Agency approved a Vesting Tentative Tract Map ("VTTM") for
Modified Alternative 2 (the "Project"); certified the EIR; and adopted

9

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 environmental findings, a statement of overriding considerations, and a mitigation
2 monitoring program.
3

4 44. On September 1, 2020, AHF timely filed an appeal from the Deputy Advisory

5 Agency's decision. On or around September 1, 2020, two other appeals also were

6 filed, by the LA Tenants Union-Hollywood Local, and by J.H. McQuiston.

7 45. On September 24, 2020, the City Planning Commission ("CPC") held a public

8 hearing to consider Case No. VTT-73718, including the appeals, and Case No.

9 CPC-2014-4705-ZC-HD-DB-MCUP-CU-SPR.

10 46. In Case No. VTT-74718, the CPC sustained the Deputy Advisory Agency's

11 determination; denied AHF's appeal and the other appeals; certified the EIR;
12 adopted environmental findings, a statement of overriding considerations, and a
13 mitigation monitoring program; and adopted Findings and Modified Conditions of
14 Approval.

15 47. In Case No. CPC-2014-4705-ZC-HD-DB-MCUP-CU-SPR, the CPC approved and
16 recommended that the City Council adopt a Zone Change and a Height District
17 Change; approved a Density Bonus Compliance Review, a Master Conditional Use
18 Permit for the sale and dispensing of alcoholic beverages for on-site consumption,
19 a Conditional Use Permit to allow for live entertainment and dancing within the
20 site's commercial uses, and a Site Plan Review; and adopted Amended Findings
21 and Modified Conditions of Approval.
22 48. On October 9, 2020, AHF timely filed an appeal from the CPC's decision in Case
23 No. VTT-73718.
24 49. Two other appeals were filed from the CPC's decision in Case No. CPC-2014-
25 4705-ZC-HD-DB-MCUP-CU-SPR. The LA Tenants Union-Hollywood Local and
26 the Yucca Argyle Tenants Union filed an appeal on October 15, 2020, and J.H.
27 McQuiston filed an appeal on October 23, 2020.
28
29 50. On December 3, 2020, the City Council's Planning and Land Use Management

30 (PLUM) Committee held a public hearing to consider the Project and the pending

31 appeals for both Case No. CPC-2014-4705-ZC-HD-DB-MCUP-CU-SPR and Case
No. VTT-73718. The PLUM Committee voted to recommend that the City
32
33 Council deny the appeals filed by AHF, the LA Tenants Union-Hollywood Local

34 and the Yucca Argyle Tenants Union, and J.H. McQuiston.

35 51.On December 8, 2020, the City Council adopted the PLUM Committee's

10

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 recommendations, denying the appeals and approving the Project.
2 52. On December 11, 2020, the City a filed a Notice of Determination for the Project 3 with the Los Angeles City Clerk. 4

5 53. As a result of the proceedings set forth above, the City has approved the following

6 discretionary Project Entitlements:
a. Vesting Tentative Tract Map No, 73718; 7 b. A Zone Change and Height District Change from C4-2D-SN to (T)(Q)C2-
8 2D-SN, from R3-2D to (T)(Q)C2-2D, and from [Q]R3-1XL to (T)(Q)R3-

11 e, A Conditional Use Permit to allow for live entertainment and dancing; and
12 f. A Site Plan Review for a development project that creates over 50 dwelling
units. 03002% First Cause of Action
Violations of California Environmental Quality Act)
(Public Resources Code, § 21168, Code of Civil Procedure §§ 525, 1085, 1094.5)
54. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates all of the above paragraphs as if fully
19 set forth herein.

20 55. CEQA requires the lead agency for a project to prepare an EIR that complies with
21 the requirements of the statute. The lead agency also must provide for public

22 review and comment on the project and associated environmental documentation.

23 An EIR must provide an adequate project description and sufficient environmental

24 analysis such that decision-makers can intelligently consider environmental
consequences when acting on the proposed project. 25
26 56. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying a Final EIR that fails to adequately

27 disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's environmental impacts in many ways,

28 as alleged below.

29 57. The EIR fails to provide an adequate project description. The EIR's project
30 description is inadequate in significant ways, including that it fails to provide
31 essential information about the potential factors that could affect the construction
32 schedule and likely effects of such factors.

33 58. The EIR adopts inadequate mitigation measures. Some of the approved mitigation
34 measures are vague, deferred, unenforceable, ineffective, or inadequate to truly
35 mitigate the Project's impacts. Among these ineffective and inadequate mitigation

11

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- measures is Mitigation Measure C-1 regarding air quality impacts during
2 construction, which relies on incorrect modeling and is unlikely to reduce impacts
3 to less than significant.
4
40 0 M ∞ 59. The EIR improperly labels some mitigation measures as Project design features.
The EIR concludes some environmental impacts are not significant because of
project design features ("PDFs") included in the Project. This conclusion violates
CEQA because many of the identified PDFs, rather than being features of the
Project's design, are in fact measures to reduce or eliminate environmental
9
10 impacts. Under the CEQA Guidelines § 15126.4(a)(1)(B), the City was required

11 to evaluate the significance of impacts before mitigation and then analyze

12 available mitigation measures and the selection of some and rejection of others.

13 a. The PDFs that are in reality mitigation measures include, but are not

14 limited to, PDF-AES-2, temporary construction fencing; PDF-AQ-1, green

15 building measures; PDF-GHG-1, GHG emission offsets; PDF-GHG-2,

16 20% of code-required parking capable of supporting future EVSE; PDF-

17 GHG-3, 5% of code-required parking equipped with EV charging stations;

18 PDF-POL-1, temporary security measures; PDF-TRAF-1, construction

19 traffic management plan; PDF-TRAF-2, pedestrian safety plan; and PDF-

20 WS-1, water conservation measures. Mischaracterizing these measures as

21 PDFs interferes with the EIR's disclosure and analysis of the Project's

22 environmental impacts to allow for fully informed decision making.

23 b. The mischaracterization of mitigation measures as project design features

24 is highlighted by the project design features identified for noise impacts.

25 PDF-NOI-1 provides that generators used in construction will be electric or

26 solar powered, while MM-NOI-2 provides for use of electric power cranes
27 and other electric equipment during construction. PDF-NOI-2 prohibits
28 impact pile drivers and blasting during construction, and MM-NOI-2
29 contains those same prohibitions among its requirements.

30 60. The Final EIR fails to disclose that the Project's greenhouse gas ("GHG") impacts
31 are cumulatively significant. In support of its conclusion that the Project's GHG
32 emissions are not cumulatively considerable under this threshold, the DEIR
33 analyzes consistency with the CARB 2017 Climate Change Scoping Plan, SCAG's
34 2016-2040 RTP/SCS, and the City's Green New Deal and Green Building Code.
35 Despite the EIR's conclusion to the contrary, the Project is not consistent with any

12

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

SOxJaUEWN- of these documents.
61. The EIR's conclusion that the Project is consistent with the 2017 Scoping Plan is
an important part of the EIR's analysis purporting to show that the Project's GHG
emissions are not cumulatively considerable. Yet the EIR contains no significant
analysis showing the Project is consistent with the 2017 Scoping Plan.
62. The EIR's GHG analysis also is defective because to be consistent with statewide
GHG-reduction goals, the Project must do more than its pro-rata share because
most housing in the state will not be modified to reduce GHG emissions in the
next ten years.
11 New projects must bear a larger than average share of the
reductions in order to be consistent with the 2017 Scoping Plan and this Project

12 fails to accomplish this, including by the fact that its operational emissions are

13
14 higher than the CEQA GHG threshold adopted by the South Coast Air Quality
Management District.
T 16 63. Because the Project's GHG impacts are significant, so Respondents are required to

s adopt all feasible mitigation measures. Given that the Project's GHG impacts are
cumulatively considerable, CEQA requires all feasible mitigation measures to be

19 adopted. PDF-GHG-1 is really a mitigation measure. It requires off-site offsets.

20 Off-site offsets have nothing to do with the Project's design and therefore cannot

21 be project design features. The EIR should have analyzed the Project's GHG
impacts without offsets.
22
23 64. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate air-quality impacts of the

24 Project. Among its flaws, the EIR does not adequately analyze operational air-

25 quality impacts of the Project. The DEIR states that the operational emission

26 estimates assume compliance with PDF-AQ-1, which includes increased energy

27 efficiency features. The measures included in PDF-AQ-1 are measures designed to

28 reduce operational emissions in other words, they are mitigation measures.

29 Therefore, the EIR fails to present information and analysis about the potentially

30 significant operational impacts without mitigation. The EIR also fails to
adequately discuss or
31 support the selection of significance thresholds for air-

32 quality impacts, contrary to CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.7.

33 65. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate hazards and hazardous

34 materials. The EIR relies improperly on the Initial Study's conclusion that the

35 Project would have no potentially significant impacts in this area. But the Project

13

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- involves demolition of structures built before 1953, which may contain asbestos or
2 lead-based paint. Toxic dust from the demolition could affect people near the
3 Project site.
4

5 66. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate the Project's impact on

6 noise by failing to adequately analyze, disclose, or mitigate for the Project's

7 construction noise impacts as well as operational noise impacts, particularly on

8 nearby sensitive receptors. The EIR's noise analysis concludes that construction-

9 related noise and vibration impacts will be significant and unavoidable but that

10 operational impacts will be less than significant. The analysis and proposed

11 mitigation are flawed in both respects. The mitigation measures for noise impacts

12 are vague and inadequate, and the record lacks support to show they are feasible
13 and enforceable and will not be effective to reduce noise and vibration impacts.

14 The EIR also fails to sufficiently explain how the proposed mitigation measures

15 will reduce construction and operational noise impacts to less than significant
levels.
16
on 17 67. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate the Project's impact
~2 human beings, including to their population and housing, by failing to analyze the
Project's induced gentrification and displacement impact on residents. The
20 displaced residents include lower-income residents who currently live at the
21 Project site. The EIR also fails to adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate the

22 Project's associated human-health impacts.

23 68. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate the Project's impact on

24 transportation and traffic, including by failing to analyze, disclose, or mitigate for

25 impacts on local traffic as well as freeway traffic. The EIR and traffic analysis do
26 not adequately evaluate construction and operation impacts on surrounding land
27 uses. The construction traffic management plan is improper mitigation.
28 Additionally, the analysis of parking supply and capacity is inadequate. The
29 discussion of impacts under threshold (a) fails to adequately analyze the
30 significance of the Project's impacts before implementation of PDF-TRAF-1,
31 construction traffic management plan, and PDF-TRAF-2, pedestrian safety plan.

32 The analysis of vehicle miles traveled is also insufficient and incorrect.The EIR
33 fails to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's cumulative impacts. The EIR's
34 analysis of cumulative air-quality impacts violates CEQA because the analysis is

35 based on the contention that the air-quality impacts of nearby projects are not

14

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 significant, and therefore the Project's air-quality cumulative impacts are not
2 significant.
3
4 69. The EIR's analysis of impacts to cultural resources is inadequate, including in its

5 discussion of impacts to historical resources.

6 a. The Vista del Mar/Carlos Historic District is in the immediate vicinity of

7 the Project site. This District was determined to be eligible for the

8 National Register of Historic Places, and is listed in the California Register

9 of Historic Resources. It is therefore a historical resource under CEQA.

10 b. The EIR's analysis improperly concludes that there will be no significant
11 impacts to the Vista del Mar/Carlos Historic District. First, the analysis
12 concludes that 1765 North Vista del Mar Avenue is not a contributor to the

13 historic district, but that conclusion was not properly reached. The historic
14 district was first recognized in 1984, and 1765 North Vista del Mar Avenue
357 was identified as a contributor then, as it was in 1994 and in 2010. The
EIR claims that 1765 North Vista del Mar Avenue does not meet the
criteria for eligibility as a contributor to the Vista del Mar/Carlos Historic
18 District because it has been highly altered. But the alterations referenced
19 occurred before the residence was identified as a contributor, and there is
20 no basis for the EIR's conclusion that it is no longer is a contributor.
3 c. The EIR cannot re-evaluate the historic district for purposes of the Project
22 in a way that conflicts with the City's historic resources surveys, which
23 have not determined that 1765 North Vista del Mar Avenue is an ineligible
24 non-contributor. This includes both the 2010 and 2020 Hollywood
25 surveys, both of which identified 14 contributors to the historic district, not
26 13, as stated in the EIR.
27 d. Additionally, the conclusion that the Project will not cause a significant
28 impact to the Vista del Mar/Carlos Historic District is based on a faulty
29 analysis of impacts to the individual buildings without adequate
30 consideration of the character of the historic district as a whole.
31 e. The Final EIR explains that the Project's tower would potentially impact
32 the setting and original layout of the historic district because of the contrast
33 in scale, but that the originally planned Building 2 would provide a
34 transitional buffer between the Project's contemporary tower and the
35

15

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

a 0PO N J historic district. (FEIR pp. 3-34-3-35.) Now that the Project no longer
incorporates Building 2, that transitional buffer has been removed. Yet the
Final EIR contains only conclusory and unsupported statements that
2 Modified Alternative 2 would be compatible with the historic district's
massing, size, scale, and architectural features and would protect the
historic integrity of the district and its environment.
7
8 70. CEQA requires a detailed good-faith response to comments the agency disagrees

9 with. Many unadopted mitigation measures were proposed in public comments on

10 the Project, and Respondents failed to adequately respond to some of those
comments.
11
12 71. As a result of the foregoing defects and others according to proof, Respondents
13 prejudicially abused their discretion by certifying an EIR that does not comply
14 with CEQA and by approving the Project in reliance thereon. Respondents also
20222 prejudicially abused their discretion by making determinations or adopting
findings that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA and approving the
Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondents' certification of the Final
EIR and purported approval of the Project must be set aside.

Second Cause of Action
20 (Violations of Subdivision Map Act)
21 (Government Code, § 66499.37; Code of Civil Procedure, §§ 525, 1094.5)
22
23 72. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates all of the above paragraphs as if fully
set forth herein.
24
25 73. Respondents abused their discretion under the Subdivision Map Act in approving

26 the Project's tentative vesting tract map because the findings are not supported by

27 substantial evidence. Substantial evidence before Respondents at the time of the

28 approval required the denial of the Project due to its inconsistency with the

29 Subdivision Map Act's substantive requirements.

30 74. Gov. Code § 66473.1 requires that the City disapprove a VTTM application unless

31 it finds that the design of the project will, to the extent feasible, provide for future
32 passive or natural heating or cooling opportunities in the subdivision. The City
33 made a purported finding on this issue in this case, SMA finding (h). But that
34 finding is insufficient and completely conclusory, treated like just another check-

35 off box for the City in preparing the VTTM findings. There is no evidence in the

16

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

record showing the developer has made any attempt to maximize passive and
2 natural heating or cooling opportunities in the Project.
cn 75. The SMA requires that every feasible measure that will increase passive or natural 4 cooling or heating to be adopted. The Project has not come close to that; much 40O more could be done without exorbitant cost. The City violated the SMA by
approving the Project when there is no evidence in the record that any of the many 7 potential measures to increase passive or natural cooling or heating were even co considered.

10 76. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
discretion by making determinations and adopting findings that do not comply 11 with the requirements of the Subdivision Map Act. Accordingly, Respondents' 12
3095. approval of the Project must be set aside.

Third Cause of Action
(Declaratory Relief)
(California Code of Civil Procedure § 1060)
18 77. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates all of the above paragraphs as if fully
set forth herein. 19
20 78. A dispute has arisen between Petitioner and Respondents, in that Petitioner
21 believes and contends, for the reasons set forth in the causes of action above, that
22 Respondents' actions as set forth above were unlawful and invalid. Petitioner is
23 informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Respondents contend in all

24 respects to the contrary.

25 79. Specifically, Petitioner contends that Respondents violated the Subdivision Map
26 Act and the California Environmental Quality Act.
27 80. Petitioner is informed and believes that in response to Petitioner having identified
28 these issues for Respondents, Respondents have disagreed with Petitioner's
29 contentions.
30 81. A judicial declaration as to the legality of Respondents' actions, as set forth above,
31 is therefore necessary and appropriate to determine the respective rights and duties
32 of the parties.

Re: Notice of Intent to Commence CEQA Action
AIDS Healthcare Foundation v. City of Los Angeles, et al.

Dear Ms. Wolcott:

This is to inform you, as an agent for the City of Los Angeles (the "City") and the Los Angeles City Council (the "City Council'), that AIDS Healthcare Foundation will be filing suit against the City and the City Council to challenge the December 8, 2020 action of the City adopting an environmental impact report pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act
("CEQA") for the construction of an approximately 7,780 square foot mixed-use development located at 1756, 1760 North Argyle Avenue and 6210-6224 West Yucca Street in Los Angeles (the "Project"), along with a zone and height district change, a Vesting Tentative Tract Map, a master conditional use permit, and all other entitlements to support the project.
Please take notice under section 21167.5 of the Public Resources Code that Petitioners
intend to include a cause of action under the provisions of CEQA against the City and the City
Council. The lawsuit will challenge, among other things, the Environmental Impact Report's
failures to adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate the Project's environmental impacts, and the City's decision to approve the project despite failing to analyze an appropriate range of alternatives that would reduce or minimize the expected environmental impacts.
Sincerely,
