1. Petitioners California Coastkeeper, also doing business as California Coastkeeper

2 Alliance ("CCKA"), and Orange County Coastkeeper ("Coastkeeper") (collectively, "Petitioners" or

3 "Keepers") hereby seek a Writ of Mandate against the California Regional Water Quality Control

4 Board, Santa Ana Region (*'Santa Ana Regional Water Board" or "Regional Board") for failing to

5 comply with the mandatory requirements of California Water Code section 13142.5(b), as applied

6 through the Water Quality Control Plan for the Ocean Waters of California, and the California

7 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), California Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq., by

9 CA8000403, Waste Discharge Requirements for Poseidon Resources ("Poseidon") L.L.C. Huntington

10 Beach Desalination Facility Orange County ("Order"). In adopting the Order, the Santa Ana Regional

11 Water Board prejudicially abused its discretion because it failed to proceed in the manner required by

12 law, failed to make findings required by law, and made findings not supported by the evidence.

13 INTRODUCTION

14 2. Since 2001, Poseidon has sought to construct and operate a 50 million gallons per day

15 (*MGD") desalination facility (the "Poseidon Facility') in Huntington Beach, California, adjacent to

16 the current location of the AES Huntington Beach Generating Station ("AES Power Plant"), using the

17 seawater intake and discharge pipes that the AES Power Plant intends to discontinue using pursuant to

18 applicable federal and state requirements.

19 3. On April 29, 2021, the Santa Ana Regional Water Board issued Order No. R8-2021-

20 0011, NPDES No. CA8000403 to Poseidon, thereby authorizing it to operate a seawater desalination

21 facility with the intake capacity to withdraw approximately 107 MGD of seawater and marine life, to

22 discharge approximately 56 MGD of highly concentrated brine and pollutants associated with the

23 Poseidon Facility's operation, using the AES Power Plant's intake and discharge pipes.

24 4. "Seawater Desalination" refers to the process of pumping seawater from the near-shore

25 ocean into reverse osmosis facility that uses electricity to force intake water through a permeable

26 membrane to extract salts. During this process, all marine life in the intake water is killed. The potable

27 water produced by this process is then either distributed into a drinking water system or injected into

28 the local groundwater aquifer for storage and future use (as is likely for the proposed Poseidon

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

Facility). It typically takes two gallons of seawater to create one gallon of potable water. The salt

2 concentration in the reject water, typically referred to as brine, is twice as great as the salt concentration

3 in intake seawater and the coastal water into which it is typically discharged.

4 5. A seawater desalination facility withdraws seawater from either subsurface or surface

5 intake structures and pumps the intake water into the desalination facility.

6 6. Facilities that utilize subsurface intakes will drill a well from the shore out to the ocean

7 beneath the seafloor so that the well can draw seawater through the seafloor, into the underground pipe

8 (similar to a groundwater well), which IS then pumped to the facility.

23 Subsurface intakes extract seawater from beneath the ground, filtering the seawater through the

24 geological features of the seafloor. Subsurface intakes act as a natural barrier to organisms and thus

25 eliminate marine life mortality from impingement and entrainment. Because the water is naturally

26 filtered as it moves through sediments, it generally contains lower levels of contaminants such as

27 suspended solids, silts, organic contaminants, oil, and grease. Subsurface intakes do not require full

28 conventional pretreatment, resulting in cheaper life-cycle costs compared to open ocean intakes, and

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

allowing subsurface intakes to produce water cheaper than large-scale open ocean desalination

2 facilities. This gives subsurface intakes a significant environmental advantage over surface water

3 intakes because a project using subsurface intakes will not have to mitigate for its marine life impacts

4 throughout the operational lifetime of the facility, while also saving money on pretreatment and using

5 less energy due to the natural pretreatment that improves water quality.

6 7. In contrast, surface water intakes draw seawater directly from the ocean through pipe

7 above the seafloor. Surface water intakes have a significant impact, causing marine life mortality

8 through impingement and entrainment. Impingement occurs when marine life is trapped against the

9 intake screen and are unable to dislodge themselves. Entrainment occurs when marine life is sucked

10 through the screens and drawn into the facility for processing. Marine life does not survive entrainment.

11 Marine life entrained through surface water intakes is exposed to high pressure, significantly higher

12 salinities, and increases in temperature during processing activities, resulting in the rupture of the

13 marine life's cellular composition and mortality. Entrainment typically affects smaller organisms in the

14 water column such as algae, plankton, fish and invertebrate larvae (e.g. shellfish) and eggs.

8. Given the destructive nature of surface intakes, as contrasted with subsurface intakes, the

2 State of California has found that these types of seawater desalination facilities create "significant"

3 adverse impacts to marine life.

4 9. In addition to impingement and entrainment impacts on marine life, desalination

5 facilities also discharge brine wastes to near-shore waters that can result in toxic plumes. Concentrated

6 a brine has a greater density than natural seawater. The increased density can cause the plume to sink and

7 spread on the seafloor instead of mixing with the surrounding water. Bottom-dwelling marine life can

8 thus have increased exposure to the brine and other potentially toxic pollutants, which decreases

9 dissolved oxygen in the water, suffocating animals on the seafloor. Lab and field studies have shown

10 the potential for acute and chronic toxicity and small-scale alterations to community structure after

11 being exposed to concentrations of brine near discharge sites. Brine discharges may cause shear-related

12 mortality. Shear stress is the measure of friction or force from the discharge on an organism in the path

13 of the discharge. At certain velocities, the shear stress can be lethal to marine life. This is a concern for

14 facilities that discharge their brine waste through multiport diffusers. Although this method rapidly

15 dilutes the waste, the velocity of the brine waste at the point of discharge results in marine life

16 mortality.

24 10. In addition to environmental impacts, seawater desalination is the costliest option for
25 supplying potable water. The Municipal Water District of Orange County's ("MWDOC") most recent
26 water reliability study documented that Orange County has numerous alternative water supply projects
27 undergoing regulatory approval available to meet future needs. The study determined that the Poseidon
28

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

Facility is the least cost-effective and most financially risky of all of the alternatives reviewed.

2 11. As another example of desalination's environmental impacts, the State Water Resources

3 Control Board ("State Board") has found that the energy consumption associated with seawater

4 desalination is the most energy intensive alternative compared to other water supply options in

5 California.

6 12. Lessons learned from recent experiences with desalination plants in the United States

7 and Australia show that desalination plants create economic risk as well. "Demand risk" is the term

8 used when consumer demand for desalinated water cannot justify the cost of operating a desalination

9 plant. Demand risk raises serious concerns about the size and timing of desalination projects.

10 13. Studies estimate that, on average, from 2000 to 2005, 19.4 billion fish larvae were

11 entrained at California seawater intakes for cooling coastal power plants (referred to as "Once-Through

12 Cooling"). During the same time, approximately 2.7 million fish (84,250 pounds) annually were

13 impinged at power plants, along with marine mammals and sea turtles.

14 14. Given the significant environmental impacts associated with the intake of seawater for

15 once-through cooling, on May 4, 2010, the State Board adopted regulations to create technology-based

16 standards for coastal facilities that utilize recirculating air or water towers to cool a power plant's

17 generators without the need to intake large amounts of seawater (the "Once-Through Cooling Policy").

18 The Once-Through Cooling Policy applied to 13 existing power plants. One of these plants is the AES

19 Power Plant, where Poseidon hopes to locate its desalination facility.

20 15. The State Board's Once-Through Cooling Policy implements the federal Clean Water

21 Act requirements to minimize adverse environmental impacts associated with cooling water intake

22 structures on marine and estuarine life. The Once-Through Cooling Policy identifies closed-cycle

23 cooling towers as the best available technology, thus phasing out seawater intakes along the California

24 coastline.

25 16. The Water Quality Control Plan for the Ocean Waters of California ("Ocean Plan")

26 serves as the State's foundational document to establish water quality objectives for California's ocean

27 waters, as required by the Clean Water Act and provides the authority to regulate wastes discharged

28 into California's coastal waters. The State Board adopted the Ocean Plan, which has regulatory effect

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

and applies to other agencies unless they have statutes to the contrary. The State Water Board and six

2 coastal regional water quality control boards ("regional water boards") implement the Ocean Plan.

3 17. The State Board has directed all affected regional water boards to implement the Ocean

4 Plan's provisions. The Ocean Plan is typically implemented through NPDES permits issued by the

5 regional water boards for all discharges into ocean waters of the State.

6 18. In 2015, the State Board amended the Ocean Plan in 2015 in order to protect ocean water

7 quality and marine life from those impacts associated with the construction and operation of seawater
8 desalination facilities (the "Desalination Amendment"). (Chapter III.M of the Ocean Plan). When

9 formulating the Desalination Amendment's requirements, the State Board was guided by, and relied

10 upon, much of the evidence and information it developed when adopting the Once-Through Cooling

11 Policy. The Desalination Amendment is a codified and enforceable regulation that implements

12 California Water Code section 13142.5(b).

13 19. On April 29, 2021, Respondent Santa Ana Regional Water Board adopted its Order,

14 granting Poseidon an NPDES permit. The Order allows Poseidon to site its desalination facility at the

15 AES Power Plant and allows Poseidon to use once-through cooling pipes to pull approximately 107

16 MGD from the ocean. As explained below, the Santa Ana Regional Water Board adopted the Order

17 without following the requirements found in the California Water Code section 13142.5(b), the Ocean

18 Plan (as set forth in the Desalination Amendment), and CEQA, thereby failing to adequately meet the

19 Ocean Plan's goal to protect marine life and water quality from impacts from Poseidon's proposed

20 seawater desalination project, which is expected to operate for 50 years.

11 denial and dismissal of the petition for review, SWRCB/OCC File A-2742, in accordance with section

12 13330 of the California Water Code. Petitioners have exhausted any and all available administrative

13 remedies to the extent required by law.

14 30. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 388, Petitioners are serving the Attorney

15 General with a copy a of this Petition for Writ of Mandate along with a notice of its filing.

16 LEGAL BACKGOUND

17 Federal Clean Water Act

18 31. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, known as the Clean Water Act (United States

19 Code, title 33, sections 1251, et seq.), is the principal federal statute for water quality protection. In

20 California, the State Board and nine regional water boards are authorized to implement many of the

21 Clean Water Act's provisions.

22 32. The Clean Water Act requires the State to adopt water quality standards and to submit

23 those standards for approval by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (*U.S. EPA"). For point

24 source discharges to surface water, the Clean Water Act authorizes California to administer the NPDES

25 program. (See 33 U.S.C. § 1342.)
26 Porter-Cologne Act (California Water Code)

27 33. The Porter-Cologne Water Quality Act (Water Code section 13000 et seq.), which

28 implements the Clean Water Act, is the principal law governing water quality regulation in California.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

It establishes a comprehensive program to protect water quality and the beneficial uses of water. The
2 Porter-Cologne Act applies to surface waters, wetlands, and ground water and to both point and

3 nonpoint sources of pollution. Pursuant to the Porter-Cologne Act, the policy of the State is as follows:

4 That the quality of all the waters of the State shall be protected,

5 That all activities and factors affecting the quality of water shall be regulated to attain the

6 highest water quality within reason, and

7 That the State must be prepared to exercise its full power and jurisdiction to protect the quality

8 of water in the State from degradation.

9 (Cal. Water Code section 13000).

10 34. The Porter-Cologne Act established the State Board and regional water boards, which

11 are charged with implementing its provisions and which have primary responsibility for protecting

12 water quality in California. The State Board provides program guidance and oversight, allocates funds,

13 and reviews regional water board decisions. The regional water boards have primary responsibility for

14 individual permitting, inspection, and enforcement actions within each of nine hydrologic regions.

15 35. The regional water boards regulate discharges under the Porter-Cologne Act primarily

16 through issuance of NPDES permits for point source discharges and WDRs.

17 36. The Porter-Cologne Act also requires adoption of water quality control plans that

18 contain the guiding policies of water pollution management in California. The Ocean Plan is a water

19 quality control plan. These plans identify the existing and potential beneficial uses of waters of the State

20 and establish water quality objectives to protect these uses. The water quality control plans also contain
21 implementation, surveillance, and monitoring requirements. Statewide and regional water quality

22 control plans include enforceable prohibitions.

23 California Water Code Section 13142.5(b)

24 37. Water Code section 13142.5(b) requires that for each new or expanded coastal power

25 plant or other industrial installation using seawater for cooling, heating, or industrial processing, the

26 best available site, design, technology, and mitigation measures feasible shall be used to minimize the

27 intake and mortality of all forms of marine life.

28

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate 10

California Ocean Plan

2 38. The Ocean Plan creates ocean standards to protect the beneficial uses of California's

3 marine waters through establishing water quality objectives and implementation provisions in statewide

4 water quality control plans and polices.

5 39. Chapter III.M of the Ocean Plan, the Desalination Amendment, provides the mandatory

6 regulatory framework that regional water boards must use to evaluate whether a desalination facility

7 complies with Water Code section 13142.5(b). Under Government Code section 11353, the
8 Desalination Amendment is a duly adopted regulation under state law. The Desalination Amendment

9 provides direction to the regional water boards regarding the determination required by Water Code

10 section 13142.5(b), to evaluate the best available site, design, technology, and mitigation measures

11 feasible to minimize the intake and mortality of all forms of marine life at new or expanded desalination

12 facilities.

13 40. The Desalination Amendment became effective on January 28, 2016. The regulation was

14 designed to create a systematic approach for controlling adverse effects of desalination facilities, with

15 the express purpose of protect[ing] and maintain[ing] the highest reasonable [ocean] water quality

16 possible for the use and enjoyment of the state.

17 41. The Desalination Amendment manifestly changed how regional water boards must now

18 evaluate proposed desalination facilities. Most significantly, the regulations strongly discourage the use

19 of open-ocean intake systems and, instead, establish a significant regulatory preference for subsurface

20 intake systems. The State Board found that operation of surface water intakes can result in significant

21 intake and mortality of all forms of marine life. In contrast, subsurface intake systems extract ocean

22 water though intake pipes that lie underground and collect seawater filtered through sand and sediment,

23 thereby effectively avoiding marine life intake. In the Desalination Amendment, therefore, the State

24 Board established subsurface intakes as the preferred intake technology because they are the best

25 method for minimizing intake and mortality of all forms of marine life.

26 42. The Desalination Amendment sets forth mandatory procedures that regional water

27 boards must follow before issuing a permit for a desalination facility.

28 43. Before it may take any action, a regional water board shall first analyze separately as

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate 11

independent considerations a range of feasible alternatives for the best available site, the best available

2 design, the best available technology, and the best available mitigation measures to minimize intake and

3 mortality of all forms of marine life. Then, only after performing this analysis of independent and

4 separate factors, the regional water board shall consider all four factors collectively and determine the

5 best combination of feasible alternatives to minimize intake and mortality of all forms of marine life.

6 (Chapter III.M.2(a)2 of the Ocean Plan).

7 Best Available Site (Chapter III.M.2(b) of the Ocean Plan)

8 44. As defined in the Desalination Amendment, "site" is the general onshore and offshore

9 location of a new or expanded facility. There may be multiple potential facility design configurations

10 within any given site. The regional water board shall require that the owner or operator evaluate a

11 reasonable range of alternative sites, including sites that would likely support subsurface intakes.

12 45. In order to determine whether a proposed facility site is the best available site feasible to

13 minimize intake and mortality of all forms of marine life, for each potential site identified, the regional

14 water board shall require the owner or operator to:

15 (1) Consider whether subsurface intakes are feasible.

16 (2) Consider whether the identified need for desalinated water is consistent with an applicable

17 adopted urban water management plan prepared in accordance with Water Code section

18 10631, or if no urban water management plan is available, other water planning documents

19 such as a county general plan or integrated regional water management plan.

20 (3) Analyze the feasibility of placing intake, discharge, and other facility infrastructure in a

21 location that avoid impacts to sensitive habitats and sensitive species.

22 (4) Analyze the direct and indirect effects on all forms of marine life resulting from facility

23 construction and operation, individually and in combination with potential anthropogenic

24 effects on all forms of marine life resulting from other past, present, and reasonably

25 foreseeable future activities within the area affected by the facility.

26 (5) Analyze oceanographic geologic, hydrogeologic, and seafloor topographic conditions at

27 the site, so that the siting of a facility, including the intakes and discharges, minimizes the

28 intake and mortality of all forms of marine life.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate 12

2 (6) Analyze the presence of existing discharge infrastructure, and the availability of
wastewater to dilute the facility's brine discharge.

3

4 (7) Ensure that the intake and discharge structures are not located within a Marine Protected

ün Area ("MPA") or State Water Quality Protected Area ("SWQPA") with the exception of

6 intake structures that do not have marine life mortality associated with the construction,

7 operation, and maintenance of the intake structures (e.g. slant wells). Discharges shall be

8 sited at a sufficient distance from a MPA or SWQPA so that the salinity within the

9 boundaries of a MPA or SWQPA does not exceed natural background salinity. To the

10 extent feasible, surface intakes shall be sited so as to maximize the distance from a MPA
or SWQPA.

11 Best Available Design (Chapter III.M.2(c) of the Ocean Plan)

12 46.

13 As defined in the Desalination Amendment, "design" is the size, layout, form, and

14 function of a facility, including the intake capacity and the configuration and type of infrastructure,
including intake and outfall structures.

15 47.

16 Proposed facilities must be designed as the best available design feasible to minimize

17 intake and mortality of all forms of marine life. To meet that standard, a regional water board shall
require that the owner or operator perform the following analysis:

18

19 (1) For each potential site, analyze the potential design configurations of the intake, discharge,
and other facility infrastructure to avoid impacts

20 to sensitive habitats and sensitive species.

21 (2) If the regional water board determines that subsurface intakes are not feasible and surface

22 water intakes are proposed instead, analyze potential designs for those intakes in order to

23 minimize the intake and mortality of all forms of marine life.

24 (3) Designs for the outfall should ensure that the brine mixing zone does not encompass or
otherwise adversely affect existing sensitive habitat.

25

26 (4) Designs for the outfall should ensure that discharges do not result in dense, negatively-|

27 buoyant plumes that result in adverse effects due to elevated salinity or hypoxic conditions

28 occurring outside the brine mixing zone. An owner or operator must demonstrate that the
outfall meets this requirement through plume modeling and/or field studies.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate 13

(5) Designs for the outfall structures should minimize the suspension of benthic sediments.

2 Best Available Technology (Chapter III.M.2.d. of the Ocean Plan)

3 48. As defined by the Desalination Amendment, "technology" refers to the type of

4 equipment, materials, and methods that are used to construct and operate the design components of a

5 desalination facility.

6 49. When considering a proposed desalination facility, a regional water board shall require

7 subsurface intakes unless it determines that subsurface intakes are not feasible. In order to reach an

8 infeasibility conclusion, the regional water board must first engage in a comparative analysis of the

9 factors listed below for surface and subsurface intakes.

10 50. The regional water board shall consider certain factors in determining the feasibility of

11 subsurface intakes. Under the regulation, these factors include: geotechnical data, hydrogeology,

12 benthic topography, oceanographic conditions, presence of sensitive habitats, presence of sensitive

13 species, energy use for the entire facility; design constraints (engineering, constructability), and project

14 life cycle cost. Project life cycle cost shall be determined by evaluating the total cost of planning,

15 design, land acquisition, construction, operations, maintenance, mitigation, equipment replacement and

16 disposal over the lifetime of the facility, in addition to the cost of decommissioning the facility.

17 51. A regional water board cannot conclude that subsurface intakes are infeasible simply

18 because the facility has been designed larger than needed.

19 52. A regional water board also may not determine subsurface intakes to be economically

20 infeasible solely because they may be more expensive than surface intakes. To reach a finding of

21 economic infeasibility, a regional water board must determine that any additional costs or lost

22 profitability associated with subsurface intakes, as compared to surface intakes, would render the

23 desalination facility economically unviable.

24 53. If a regional water board determines that subsurface intakes are not feasible for a

25 proposed facility's intake design capacity, it must then examine the feasibility of a reasonable range of

26 alternative intake design capacities. The regional water board may find that a combination of subsurface

27 and surface intakes is the best feasible alternative to minimize intake and mortality of marine life and

28 meet the identified need for desalinated water as described in chapter III.M.2.b.(2).

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate 14

54. If subsurface intakes are not feasible, the regional water board may approve a surface

2 water intake, subject to the following conditions:

3 i. The regional water board shall require that surface water intakes be screened. Screens

4 must be functional while the facility is withdrawing seawater.

5 ii. In order to reduce entrainment, all surface water intakes must be screened with a 1.0 mm

6 (0.04 in) or smaller slot size screen when the desalination facility is withdrawing

7 seawater.

8 Best Available Mitigation (Chapter III.M.2(3) of the Ocean Plan)

9 55. As defined by the Desalination Amendment, "mitigation" is the replacement of all forms

10 of marine life or habitat that is lost due to the construction and operation of a desalination facility after

11 minimizing intake and mortality of all forms of marine life through best available site, design, and

12 technology.

13 56. The regional water board shall ensure that an owner or operator fully mitigates for the

14 operational lifetime of the facility and uses the best available mitigation measures feasible to minimize

15 intake and mortality of all forms of marine life.

16 57. If a proposed owner/operator chooses to complete a mitigation project ("Mitigation

17 Option 1"), it shall submit a Mitigation Plan. Mitigation Plans must include: project objectives, site

18 selection, site protection instrument (the legal arrangement or instrument that will be used to ensure the

19 long-term protection of the compensatory mitigation project site), baseline site conditions, a mitigation

20 work plan, a maintenance plan, a long-term management plan, an adaptive management plan,

21 performance standards and success criteria, monitoring requirements, and financial assurances.

22 58. A mitigation project must meet the following requirements:

23 i Mitigation shall be accomplished through expansion, restoration or creation of one or

24 more of the following: kelp beds, estuaries, coastal wetlands, natural reefs, MPAs, or

25 other projects that will fully mitigate for intake and mortality of all forms of marine life

26 associated with the facility.

27 ii. The proposed facility's owner or operator shall demonstrate that the project fully

28 mitigates for intake-related marine life mortality by including expansion, restoration, or

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate 15

creation of habitat based on the amount of acreage impacted by the facility for the

2 lifetime of the project. If using surface water intakes, the owner or operator shall model
3 the mitigation project's production area to confirm it overlaps with the area of impact by

4 the facility. Impacts on the mitigation project due to entrainment by the facility must be

5 offset by adding compensatory acreage to the mitigation project.

6 iii. The owner or operator shall demonstrate that the project also fully mitigates for the

7 discharge-related marine life mortality projected in the Marine Life Mortality Report

8 above.

9 iv. The owner or operator shall demonstrate that the project also fully mitigates for the

10 construction-related marine life mortality identified in the Marine Life Mortality Report

11 above.

12 California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code commencing with section 21000)

13 59. Regional water board orders implementing Water Code section 13142.5(b) and the

14 Desalination Amendment constitute discretionary projects subject to CEQA compliance. CEQA

15 requires the preparation of an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") where there is a fair argument that a

16 a discretionary project will have significant effect on the environment. An EIR must evaluate all

17 direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects of the project and must consider a reasonable

18 range of alternatives and mitigation measures to reduce or avoid such effects.

19 60. Where an EIR is prepared and certified, but substantial changes in the project or the
20  circumstances under which the project is being undertaken, or new information of substantial

21 importance becomes available, the next agency to issue a discretionary decision on the project must

22 prepare a subsequent or supplemental EIR.

23 61. A subsequent or supplemental EIR must consider all reasonably foreseeable impacts

24 from the whole of the project, and the agency preparing the EIR may not piecemeal or segment the

25 CEQA process by deferring the consideration to reasonably foreseeable impacts to other agencies.

26 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

27 62. Poseidon proposes to construct a large regional seawater desalination facility on public
28 tidelands and adjacent private property within the City of Huntington Beach. As proposed, the Poseidon

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate 16

Facility will withdraw approximately 107 million gallons of seawater each day from the coastal waters

2 of Huntington Beach, killing all larvae and other marine life consumed through its open-ocean seawater

3 intake systems. Using an energy-intensive pre-filtration system combined with a high pressure "reverse

4 osmosis" process that extracts salt by forcing seawater through a semipermeable membrane, the

5 Poseidon Facility is designed to produce and distribute approximately 50 MGD of potable water.

6 Currently, there is only one interested purchaser for this water, Orange County Water District ("'Water

7 District"), the groundwater management agency for northern Orange County. The Water District

8 already has access to water supplies from the Santa Ana River, the Orange County Groundwater Basin,

9 and the Groundwater Replenishment System, which is the world's largest advanced water purification

10 system for potable reuse.

11 63. The Poseidon Facility will discharge approximately 56 MGD of concentrated toxic brine

12 waste back into the near-shore ecosystem, causing additional environmental harms to marine life.

13 64. The Poseidon Facility's water will likely cost the Water District at least twice as much

14 compared to other viable sources such as imported water and potable recycled wastewater.

15 65. On September 7, 2010, the City of Huntington Beach certified a Final Subsequent
16 Environmental Impact Report ("2010 FSEIR") for the Poseidon Facility. As the lead agency at the time,

17 the City of Huntington Beach adopted a CEQA Statement of Findings of Facts with Statement of

18 Overriding Considerations and Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program. On September 20,

19 2010, the City of Huntington Beach approved Coastal Development Permit No. 10-014.

20 66. Poseidon never built the Facility approved by the City of Huntington Beach in 2010, nor

21 did it obtain the requisite final approvals from affected public agencies, including the California

22 Coastal Commission, the Santa Ana Regional Water Board, the Water District, and the California State

23 Lands Commission ("State Lands").

24 67. Since 2010, changed circumstances and new information have significantly altered the

25 planning landscape, which should have compelled Poseidon to redesign the Poseidon Facility in several

26 substantial ways.

27 68. In response to increasing environmental concern over the impact of desalination

28 facilities on marine ecosystems, in 2015, the State Board adopted the Desalination Amendment. The

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate 17

Desalination Amendment now compels regional water boards to require subsurface intake systems

2 unless they are deemed infeasible. The Desalination Amendment also required regional water boards to

3 analyze intake capacities to minimize marine life mortality, and to analyze a range of sites that would

4 likely support subsurface intakes. The Desalination Amendment became effective on January 28, 2016.

5 69. The projected demand for potable water, and thus the need for the Poseidon Facility, has

6 substantially declined since 2010. Spurred by newfound water supplies and innovative conservation

7 measures, the demand for potable water in Orange County has fallen, even as water supply to the region

8 grows. Using the 2010 Regional Urban Water Management Plan, MWDOC, the regional wholesale

9 water agency, previously projected total water demand in 2035 at 525,079 acre-feet per year. By 2016,

10 however, that water demand projection for 2035 had fallen to 433,233 acre-feet per year, a 17.5 percent

11 reduction. And by March 30, 2021, MWDOC's water demand projection was 426,978 AFY for 2035,

12 and would continue to level off at the same amount through 2050.

13 70. New local sources of recycled water are becoming increasingly available for use,

14 supplanting the need for large desalination plant. In 2008, the Water District began its Groundwater

15 Replenishment System, an approach whereby wastewater is recycled and treated to produce purified

16 water for indirect potable reuse. This new practice provides a cost-effective solution to replenish water

17 supply and has recently been expanded to produce 130,00 acre-feet per year of potable water. A similar

18 Los Angeles recycling program, the Carson Indirect Potable Reuse Project, could provide Orange

19 County with up to 65,000 acre-feet of additional potable water per year - more than the proposed

20 capacity of the entire Poseidon Facility, which would produce 56,000 acre-feet per year.

21 71. Water users are simultaneously increasing their conservation practices, leading to an

22 overall decrease in demand for potable water. While water demand was previously forecasted to

23 increase during multiyear droughts, users have in fact achieved reductions on the order of 20 to 30

24 percent due to advancing practices in water conservation. Based on those projections, MWDOC staff

25 now estimates water shortfalls through 2040 of only 6,300 acre-feet per year and has concluded that the

26 Poseidon yield of 56,000 would supply more water than needed in most ever year.

27 72. Certain retail water agencies within Orange County that are customers of the Water

28 District, including Irvine Ranch Water District, have questioned the need for this desalination facility.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate 18

And as the Water District has itself confirmed, there are many routes to [water] reliability and the

2 Poseidon Facility is not specifically necessary, but merely one option among others.

3 73. On October 19, 2017, State Lands, acting as a responsible agency, certified the Final

4 Supplemental Environmental Impact Report (*2017 FSEIR") for the Poseidon Facility: Outfall/Intake

5 Modifications & General Lease - Industrial Use (PRC 1980.1) Amendment (State Clearinghouse No.

6 2001051092) and adopted a CEQA Statement of Findings of Facts with Statement of Overriding

7 Considerations and Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program. The SEIR was limited to changes in

8 the State Lands lease in response to modifications of the intake and discharge structures required in the

9 Ocean Plan Amendment. It did not consider alternatives necessary to satisfy the intervening

10 Desalination Amendment, deferring that analysis to the Santa Ana Regional Water Board, and it did not

11 consider impacts from reasonably foreseeable changes to the product water distribution system,

12 deferring that analysis to the Water District.

13 74. In 2018, Poseidon's proposed diffuser design (the diffuser design that was analyzed in

14 the 2017 FSEIR) was reviewed by Dr. Phil Roberts, an independent reviewer. In his review, Dr.

15 Roberts ultimately concluded that the proposed diffuser design was not the best available design or
16 technology to minimize intake and mortality of marine life. The Santa Ana Regional Water Board

17 prepared an Addendum to the 2010 FSEIR and the 2017 FSEIR to address the changes to the diffuser

18 design.

19 75. On November 22, 2019, the Santa Ana Regional Water Board released a tentative Order

20 No. R8-2021-0011, NPDES No. CA8000403, Waste Discharge Requirements and draft California

21 Water Code section 13142.5(b) determination for the Poseidon Facility (*Tentative Order") for public

22 review and comment. On December 6, 2019, the Santa Ana Regional Water Board held a public

23 workshop to discuss the draft Tentative Order, and to receive comments from the public. The

24 Petitioners timely submitted written comments by the public comment deadline of January 21, 2020.

25 76. On May 15, 2020, the Santa Ana Regional Water Board held another public workshop

26 limited to the project need and mitigation requirements. Most of the workshop consisted of several

27 presentations and questions from the Regional Board members followed by an extensive public

28 comment period.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate 19

77. A public hearing to consider the adoption of the Tentative Order was held July 30 and

2 31, 2020 with a third date of August 7, 2020 set for the Santa Ana Regional Water Board to deliberate.

3 78. During the hearing on July 31, 2020, several Santa Ana Regional Water Board members

4 questioned the amount of acreage awarded for the inlet maintenance dredging, which staff classified as

5 a preservation action.

6 79. After the July 31 meeting, Poseidon negotiated with Santa Ana Regional Water Board

7 staff, State Board staff, and California Environmental Protection Agency staff to modify the proposed

8 mitigation to address the Santa Ana Regional Water Board's concerns. On August 7, 2020, the third day

9 of the public hearing, Santa Ana Regional Water Board staff presented the proposal developed during

10 those discussions, which included the reduction of acres of credit for maintenance dredging to 45 acres

11 of credit.

12 80. The Santa Ana Regional Water Board rejected staff's revised recommendation for inlet

13 maintenance dredging acreage and gave direction that the dredging should not account for more than

14 25% of the required acres of mitigation credit. As a result of this reduction, Poseidon's mitigation

15 proposal was not sufficient to fully mitigate the construction and operation impacts of the Poseidon

16 Facility. Therefore, the adoption hearing was suspended until April, 2021 in order for Poseidon to

17 determine additional mitigation credits.

18 81. The Regional Board continued public hearing on the Tentative Order for the proposed
19 Poseidon-Huntington Beach Ocean Desalination facility on April 23 and April 29, 2021, with the final

20 decision on the Order made on April 29, 2021. Despite concerns over the need for the Poseidon

21 Facility, the Order was approved by a 4-3 vote.

22 82. The Santa Ana Regional Water Board approved the Order without preparing a

23 subsequent or supplemental EIR. The Santa Ana Regional Water Board prepared an Addendum to the

24 2010 FSEIR and the 2017 FSEIR to address changes to Poseidon's diffuser design. The Santa Ana

25 Regional Water Board did not evaluate the impacts from Poseidon's new mitigation measures adopted

26 within the Order, nor did the Santa Ana Regional Water Board evaluate the impacts from the

27 reasonably foreseeable change in the distribution system or the new alternatives prescribed by the

28 Desalination Amendment.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate 20

83. In the nearly 20 years since Poseidon first proposed its plan, the regulatory landscape

2 changed to impose greater scrutiny on the Facility, but the political landscape changed as well, with

3 increasing pressure put on staff and Regional Board members to approve Poseidon's proposal. This

4 pressure included removal of a Regional Board member who daylighted the lack of evidence that staff

5 had considered the correct factors under the Desalination Amendment, and appointment of members

6 who had received political donations from pro-Poseidon trade groups.

7 CAUSES OF ACTION

8 First Cause of Action for Writ of Mandate

9 Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5:

10 Violation of Water Code section 13142.5(b) and the Ocean Plan

11 84. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth in

12 paragraphs 1 through 83, inclusive, as though fully set forth herein.

13 85. The Santa Ana Regional Water Board is obligated under the Water Code to only permit

14 ocean desalination facilities when such facilities use the best available site, design, technology, and

15 mitigation measures feasible to minimize the intake and mortality of all forms of marine life.

16 86. The Santa Ana Regional Water Board failed to comply with the requirements and

17 process articulated in the Desalination Amendment within the Ocean Plan.

18 87. The Ocean Plan requires the Santa Ana Regional Water Board to conduct a Water Code

19 section 13142.5(b) analysis using a two-step evaluation process. As a preliminary and mandatory first

20 step, the Santa Ana Regional Water Board was required to "first analyze separately as independent

21 considerations a range of feasible alternatives for the best available site, the best available design, the

22 best available technology, and the best available mitigation measures to minimize intake and mortality

23 of all forms of marine life." (italics added.) Only after completing the first step may the Santa Ana

24 Regional Water Board move to the next step of the process to consider the four factors collectively to

25 determine the best combination of the identified feasible alternatives to minimize intake and mortality

26 of all forms of marine life.

27 88. The Santa Ana Regional Water Board failed to comply with the Desalination
28 Amendment's requirements by not first analyzing separately as independent considerations a range of

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate 21

feasible alternatives for the best available site, the best available design, the best available technology,

2 and the best available mitigation measures to minimize intake and mortality of all forms of marine life.

3 The Santa Ana Regional Water Board instead created its own initial test, thereby exceeding its

4 regulatory authority. Its subsequent action therefore lacked adequate evidence and findings as required.

5 89. The Santa Ana Regional Water Board's Order failed to require the best available

6 onshore site feasible to minimize marine life mortality by deeming sites infeasible due to factors outside

7 of the Desalination Amendment considerations and irrelevant to the Water Code and Ocean Plan goal

8 of minimizing marine life mortality.

9 90. The Santa Ana Regional Water Board failed to require the best available offshore site to

10 minimize marine life mortality. The Santa Ana Regional Water Board relied upon outdated data and an

11 imprecise marine life impacts calculation, instead of requiring Poseidon to perform a new entrainment

12 study. The Santa Ana Regional Water Board abused its discretion by unlawfully permitting Poseidon to

13 site its offshore intake location at the existing AES Power Plant intake location (Station E), despite a

14 third-party reviewer's conclusion that two other offshore intake locations (Station D2 or U2) would

15 result in lower marine life mortality.

16 91. The Desalination Amendment requires the Santa Ana Regional Water Board to analyze

17 a range of alternative intake capacities as part of its Best Available Design analysis to minimize the

18 intake and mortality of marine life. The Santa Ana Regional Water Board only considered one intake

19 capacity: approximately 107 MGD. The Santa Ana Regional Water Board was required to consider a

20 range of alternative intake capacities yet failed to conduct such an analysis.

21 92. The Santa Ana Regional Water Board failed to require the Best Available Technology to

22 minimize the intake and mortality of all forms of marine life. The Desalination Amendment requires the

23 Regional Board to require subsurface intakes unless it determines that subsurface intakes are not

24 feasible based upon a comparative analysis of factors.

25 93. The Santa Ana Regional Water Board improperly determined slant wells to be infeasible

26 based upon an improper additional factor of consideration: "aquifer drawdown" The Desalination

27 Amendment purposefully excluded this factor from those which regional water boards must consider,

28 and the Santa Ana Regional Water Board exceeded its authority by including it among the

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate 22

considerations to determine the Best Available Technology. The Santa Ana Regional Water Board also

2 set an arbitrary aquifer drawdown threshold that was not supported by the evidence to analyze the

3 technical feasibility of the Best Available Technology. This led to the Santa Ana Regional Water Board

4 failing to conduct an economic feasibility analysis for slant wells.

5 94. The Regional Board wrongfully relied upon a subsurface study conducted prior to the

6 adoption of the Desalination Amendment to conclude that slant wells and infiltration galleries were not

7 feasible as the Best Available Technology.

8 95. Water Code section 13142.5(b) and the Ocean Plan requires the Regional Board to

9 protect all forms of marine life. The Desalination Amendment states that if subsurface intakes are not

10 feasible, "to reduce entrainment, all surface water intakes must be screened with a 1.0 mm (0.04 in) or

11 smaller slot size screen when the desalination facility is withdrawing seawater." (italics added.)

12 96. The Regional Board failed to consider or analyze an open-ocean intake screen smaller

13 than MM as the best available technology for minimizing all forms or marine life despite evidence

14 that the effectiveness of reducing entrainment with wedgewire screens is largely a function of the size

15 of the screen slot opening.

16 97. The Ocean Plan states that "[m]itigation shall be accomplished through expansion,

17 restoration or creation." Preservation is not an element of mitigation under the Ocean Plan.

18 98. The Regional Board unlawfully abused its discretion by allowing Poseidon to mitigate a

19 significant portion of their marine life impacts through the use of preservation.

20 99. For these reasons articulated above, the Santa Ana Regional Water Board abused its

21 discretion in adopting the Order without complying with the mandates of the Water Code and the

22 Ocean Plan, specifically the Desalination Amendment, without making the required findings, and

23 without the support of evidence.

24 Second Cause of Action

25 Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 or 1085:

26 Violation of CEQA

27 100. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth in

28 paragraphs 1 through 83, inclusive, as though fully set forth herein.

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate 23

101. The Santa Anal Regional Water Board violated CEQA by failing to prepare a subsequent

2 or supplemental EIR, as required by Public Resources Code section 21166, in connection with issuance

3 of the Order. In particular, the Board's action violated CEQA in at least three ways: (1) The Order

4 imposed required certain new mitigation requirements, the impacts of which were not evaluated and

5 disclosed to the public in any CEQA-compliant document; (2) Substantial information in the record

6 demonstrates that it is reasonably foreseeable that produced water from the Poseidon Facility will be

7 injected into the local aquifer, the impacts of which were not evaluated and disclosed to the public in

8 any CEQA-compliant document; and (3) After the State Lands Commission deferred the consideration

9 of alternatives to satisfy the Desalination Amendment requirements to the Santa Ana Regional Water

10 Board, the Regional Board failed to consider and disclose those alternatives in a CEQA-compliant

11 document. By failing to evaluate and disclose these impacts and alternatives in a subsequent or

12 supplemental EIR and deferring the requisite analysis to another agency or a future administrative

13 process, the Santa Ana Regional Water Board also illegally piecemealed and segmented the CEQA

14 process.

15 102. The Santa Ana Regional Water Board's failure to comply with CEQA constitutes a

16 prejudicial abuse of discretion actionable under California Public Resources Code section 21168 or

17 21168.5 and California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 or 1085. Petitioners have a clear,

18 present, and beneficial right to the Santa Ana Regional Water Board's proper performance of its CEQA

19 obligations and has no other plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law. Petitioners, their members, and

20 the general public which they represent will be adversely affects by these legal violations and are thus

21 entitled to issuance of a writ of mandate directing the Santa Ana Regional Water Board to comply with

22 CEQA.

23 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

24 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for entry of judgment as follows:

25 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate directed to the California Regional Water Quality

26 Control Board, Santa Ana Region (1) declaring that the Order No. R8-2021-0011 for Poseidon
