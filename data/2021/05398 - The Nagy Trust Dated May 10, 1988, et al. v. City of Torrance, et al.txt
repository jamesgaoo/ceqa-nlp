P

3 Petitioner Nagy Trust Dated May 10, 1988 and Judith Nagy Goetz,
2 Trustee, respectfully submit this Petition and allege as follows:

4

5 I.

6 1. Introduction and Standard of Review
This is a petition brought under Public Resources Code section
7 21168 as well as Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 to challenge
8 Respondent City of Torrance (the "City" or "Torrance") decision to apply a

9

10 categorical exemption to a plan to build a large cantilevered pool and deck over

a steep hillside in an area known for landslides where the pool's "infinity"

RING BENDER 9Z976 ETWOHED Costa Mesa, 3150 Bristol Street, Suite 220 11 design is specifically made so that water spills over the pool's edge into a basin
12 below (the "Project"). Torrance cited a categorical exemption (commonly called
13 exemption No. 3) to justify the lack of any further environmental review.
14 2. The proposed "infinity" pool project is within the City's Hillside
15 and Coastal Overlay Zone (the "Hillside Zone"). Despite that knowledge and
16 substantial evidence in the record that such a structure could trigger
17 landslides on an unstable hillside known for landslides, Torrance pushed
18 ahead. The City's action violates two of the major exceptions to a categorical
19 exemption as stated in the Guidelines for the Implementation of the California
20 Environmental Quality Act (Cal. C. Regs., title 14, §15000 et. seq (hereafter the
21 "Guidelines")):

22 a. Guidelines section 15300.2 (a) is the location exception which says
23 certain categorial exemptions must be considered in light of the specific

24

25 location of the project;
b. Guidelines section 15300.2 (c) is the significant effect exception
26 that says in "unusual circumstances" a categorical exemption cannot trump the
27 environmental concerns surrounding a project.

28 3. The City erroneously determined this project was categorically

2
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
(CEQA)

1 exempt from environmental review under the Guidelines (14 C.C.R. § 15303(e))
2 because it is a "swimming pool." But this is not a small, garden-variety
3 backyard "swimming pool" envisioned by the Guidelines and it does not qualify

4 for a categorical exemption.

5 4.

6 The City at its October 26, 2021 City Council meeting made very
limited factual findings concerning this project's potential environmental
7 impacts. Those findings however, were confined to potential impacts on
8 existing views, light, air, and the neighbors' privacy concerns. The City also

9 found the Project would not impact certain economic values - what it termed
10 "land values and investment." The City found the Project would not be
11 "materially detrimental" to the public welfare because it would be "five feet

RING BENDER LLP ã Costa Mesa, California 92626 :aumg 13377S LOISIIg OSLE 12 below the existing level grade and incorporate a terraced retained wall design."
13 The City did not address, nor make any factual findings related to the Project's
14 potential significant effects on the existing unstable hillside and potential
15 environmental impacts of such a large Project on
16 landslides. area already known for

17 5. "A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where
18 there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect
19 on the environment due to unusual circumstances." See Guidelines $ 15300.2

20

21 (c). As discussed more fully below in Section III B, "unusual circumstances"
apply to this project because it is located on a demonstrably unstable hillside
22 with a recent history of landslides. Torrance cannot determine the "infinity"

23 pool is exempt from CEQA review if there is a "reasonable possibility" it will
24 have a significant effect on the environment. See Guidelines § 15300.2(c).
25 Torrance did not take the "unusual circumstances" into consideration and

26 there is substantial evidence in the record to support a "fair argument" that a
27 significant impact may occur from allowing this project to go forward.

The Parties 5

6. Petitioner Judith Nagy Goetz is an individual and a Trustee of the
7 | Nagy Trust (collectively "Petitioner"). The Nagy Trust owns the property 6

located at 5105 Paseo de las Tortugas in the City of Torrance, California. The
9 Nagy family and subsequent Trust have owned the property located at 5105 8

10 Paseo de las Tortugas since the 1950s.

11 7. Respondent City of Torrance is a Charter City organized and
12 existing under its Charter and the laws of the State of California, with the
979z6 ã ETUJOHED 'ESaW EUSOO A'TI HAONHA ONT 13 capacity to sue and be sued. As used herein, the term "City" includes, but is not 3mS 1320S [OISTIH OSTE 14 limited to, City employees, agents, officers, boards, commissioners,
15 departments, and their members, all equally charged with complying with the

16 duties under the City's municipal code, and with the laws of the State of

17 California and CEQA. Torrance is the lead agency responsible under CEQA for
18 evaluating the environmental impacts of the Project.

19 8. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Ajim
20 Baksh ("Baksh") is the owner of the property located at 5109 Paseo de las

21 Tortugas in the City of Torrance, California. Baksh is the party who initially
22 applied for the Minor Hillside Exemption permit that became MHE 20-0186

23 and is named as a Real-Party-In-Interest because his interests will be directly
24 affected by these proceedings.

9. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities, whether
26 individual, corporate, or otherwise, of the Respondents named herein as Does 25

27 through 100 inclusive, and Petitioner therefore sues these respondents by their

28 fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this petition to state the true names

16 Factual and Procedural Background

17 A. The Hillside Zone

18 13. Paseo de las Tortugas is a street in south Torrance which lies in
19 the Hillside Zone. The Hillside Zone is contained in Torrance Municipal Code
20 Article 41 (Section 91.41 et. seq). The properties on this street are generally
21 level with the street with the northernmost portion of the rear yards situated
22 on a steep downward slope. The homes along Paseo de las Tortugas are single
23 family residences in an R-1 zone.

14. The back yards of the residences along the north-facing hillside on
2 Paseo de las Tortugas are supported by retaining walls, and behind the 1

3 retaining walls is a steep hillside. The majority of the hillside is currently

4 covered in ice plants and flora. The vegetation secures the soil on the hillside

5 and assists in preventing erosion and landslides.

Torrance adopted the Hillside Zone in 1977 in recognition of
19 developmental challenges presented by the area's topography; specifically, the 18 15.

20 steep hillsides on the slopes of the Palos Verdes Peninsula.
Because of the sensitive nature of the area, Torrance Municipal
22 Code Section 91.41.1 mandates "[n]o permits shall be issued for development in 21 16.

23 the Hillside and Coastal Zone unless the requirements of this Article have been
24 met." Section 91.41.4 requires that any applications for development in the
25 Zone require the Planning Director to set a date for a public hearing with the
26 Planning Commission where "[t]he applicant shall have the burden of proving
27 that all the requirements of this Article have been met."

6 28 17. The Minor Hillside Exemption permit process requires the

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
(CEQA)

1 applicant to apply to the Community Development Director for approval of the
2 proposed construction. The Director's approval may be appealed to the
3 Planning Commission, and the Planning Commission's decision may then be

4 appealed to the Torrance City Council.

5

6 B. "The Hill Is Pretty Damn Fragile"

7 18. There have been three landslides recorded on the same slope
8 within approximately ½ mile of the Project. The Palos Verdes Fault, a major

9 geological fault that is described as an active structure in Southern California
10 comprised of several segments that together form a complex fault system, is

11 mapped to cross the slope at the site of the proposed "infinity" pool project. The
12 slope and proposed project are also located within a California state-mapped
RING BENDER LLP 9ZIT6 ETCUIOUEO ESaM usOo ozz mmg 433NS LOISUg OSIS 13 zone of areas susceptible to earthquake-induced landslides.

14 19. In April 1986, a landslide destroyed two residences on the same
15 slope, located 2 tenths of a mile away from the proposed construction at 5109
16 Paseo de las Tortugas. The landslide destroyed one home at the bottom of the
17 hill and forced the City to purchase from its owner a second home left teetering
of the hill had a gazebo, a 18 at the top. Before the landslide, the home at the top
19 fish pond, and a 16-foot waterfall.

20 20. According to Phil Tilden, the City's then-management programs
21 administrator, "a clay called malaga mudstone that underlines the hillside
22 became saturated with water and slid" down the hill. A Daily Breeze article
23 dated December 16, 1987 quoting Mr. Tilden attributed the landslide to
24 subsurface water that accumulated over time. The source of the subsurface
25 water was never determined, but a geology firm hired to evaluate the landslide

26 opined it could have come from rainfall, irrigation (such as lawn watering), or a
27 broken city waterline.

28 21. The 1986 landslide eventually required Torrance to drive 25 steel

7
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
(CEQA)

1 pilings into the hillside to stabilize it, along with installing a drainage system

2 designed to prevent future landslides from occurring.

3 22. Former-Assistant City Attorney Bill Quayle confirmed the
4 hillside's instability in a Daily Breeze article dated January 9, 1987: "The fact
5 that the hillside slid again [another 4 feet in December 1986] confirms what

6 our geologist told us . . . and that is that the hill is pretty damn fragile." The
7 article said the slope first collapsed in April 1986 and "[a]nother chunk of
8 hillside dropped 4 feet last month."

9 23. The City is well aware of the threat landslides present based on its

10 own local planning documents. In 2004 the City published a document entitled
11 "Local Hazard Mitigation Plan" which is required by the Federal Emergency
12 Management Agency (FEMA) and must be approved by the City Council and

RING BENDER 9T9T6 EILLIOUTEO ESPT EISOO ozz amg 190S jOSuE OSLE 13 the State of California. Torrance published another "Local Hazard Mitigation
14 Plan" in 2017.

15 24. Both the 2004 and 2017 "Local Hazard Mitigation Plan" identified
16 landslides in South Torrance as a hazard. The 2004 plan says at page 73:

17 "Although landslides are a natural geologic process, the incidence of landslides

18 and their impacts on people can be exacerbated by development. Grading for
19 road construction and development can increase the degree of the slope.
20 Grading and construction can decrease the stability of a hill slope by adding
21 weight to the top of the slope, removing support at the base of the slope, and
22 increasing water content. Other human activities effecting landslides include
23 excavation, drainage and groundwater alterations, and changes in vegetation."
24 25. The 2017 plan similarly cautions that "mitigation" actions for
25 landslides include, "Plant and maintain vegetation along cliffs and slopes to
26 hold soil together and reduce the potential for landslides," and "Continue to

12 C. The Proposed "Infinity" Pool

ITI MHONHA ONIH 9Z9TG ETOyNEO ESaN ESOD otz euIs I33NS LOISTE OSTE 13 26. Baksh requested a Minor Hillside Exemption permit to construct
14 an "infinity" pool and corresponding deck that would extend from the top of the
15 hillside out over the slope, which stretches from the retaining wall downward
16 approximately 100 feet.
17 27. By design, the water in the proposed "infinity" pool is not entirely
18 contained in the pool; water at the far edge of the pool will spill over into a
19 basin approximately 10-feet below at the bottom of the hillside.
20 28. According to Baksh's plans, the pool would be secured by 30-inch
21 diameter concrete piles connected with 24- to 30-inch deep concrete grade
22 beams. The piles would be sunk into the hillside. A Staff Report prepared for
23 the Planning Commission's August 4, 2021 meeting described the projects'
24 dimensions thusly:
25

26 'The deck measures 52' wide by 24' in depth, and provides a 5' side
27 yard setbacks on both sides and a rear a yard setback of 67 feet. Due
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
(CEQA)

to its curvilinear shape, the catch basin for the infinity pool is 63'-
2 10" from the rear property line. According to the elevations
0d included in the plans, the height of the deck measured from the
lowest adjacent grade along the north (rear) elevation to the top of
the guardrail is 9'-10." N∞ D. Torrance and Baksh Have Avoided Any Environmental Review of
Potential Impacts on the Hillside

29. No geotechnical design, report, or investigation was referenced in
10 Baksh's plans for the proposed "infinity" pool. Despite the history of

11 landslides and preexisting knowledge of the hillside's instability, Torrance
12 apparently did not require any.

30. The Staff Reports recommending approval of the Minor Hillside I'TI HAONEE ONTI 97976 BIWOTRD ESa EISOJ ozz ams 133US [OISTSI OSTE 14 Exemption to both the City Council and Planning Commission contain no 13

15 evidence Baksh or City Staff conducted soils studies, geologic studies,
16 compaction studies, or any investigation of potential environmental impacts

17 on the hillside whatsoever. There has been no evaluation of how the

18 impervious deck and structure will affect rain water flows on the hillside or
19 the subsurface water in the ground beneath the surface. There was no study

20 or consideration for erosion that may occur by removing the ice plants and

21 flora on the hillside and replacing them with the pool structure.

31. Petitioner requested all e-mail and other correspondence between
23 Baksh and City Staff concerning the proposed project via Public Records Act 22

24 ("PRA") requests. None of the e-mail or handful of text messages Torrance
25 eventually produced contained any discussion of engineering or environmental
26 concerns about the proposed "infinity" pool or the hillside. There was no

28 construction. There is no mention or consideration of landslides or the area's 27 discussion about the possibility of destabilizing the hillside with the proposed

10
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
(CEQA)

- history of landslides in the correspondence.

2 32. Petitioners commissioned an engineering study which was
3 conducted by a California Registered Professional Civil and Geotechnical
4 Engineer at SPC Engineering. A true and correct copy of the engineering

6 firm's letter of findings is attached as Exhibit 1. The study suggests the

7 hillside was graded when the homes were originally constructed, and the top

8 of the hillside is largely comprised of "fill." According to the Los Angeles

9 County Public Works Grading Guidelines, "fill" is described as "Deposition of
earth materials by artificial means." "Fill" is not intended to support a
10 structure. SPC Engineering's study says the slope below the "fill" is "likely
11 composed of older dune deposits, sandy marine sediment, and laminated

RING BENDER LLP 3150 Bristol Street, Suite 220 C9T6 EILIOJTEO 'ESOTN EISOO 12 siltstone bedrock." The study, dated October 20, 2021, was submitted to the
13 City of Torrance, and is the only geologic study conducted on the hillside.
14 There is nothing in the record that identifies what lies beneath the billside's
15 surface, or whether there are fault lines or fractures in the hillside that would
16 affect its stability and integrity.

17 33. According to SPC Engineering's report, the lack of inquiry
18 and investigation means the environmental impacts of the proposed
19  construction are unknown:

20

21

22 "It is unknown at this time whether the proposed construction

23 meets the geotechnical requirements, such as slope stability, fill

24 density and susceptibility to settlement, proper embedment of

25 foundations into competent bedrock, soil strength parameters,

26 horizontal setback distance, slope creep loads, lateral earth
pressures, and others."

27

28 34. The City Council Resolution denying Petitioner's appeal and

11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
(CEQA)

1 approving Baksh's Minor Hillside Exemption permit (Resolution No. 2021-86)
2 makes no factual findings of any kind regarding soils, environmental review,
3 or landslides.

Procedural History 5 E.

35. The Community Development Director notified Petitioner of the
7 proposed project on February 16, 2021 via letter. Petitioner timely lodged 6

8 objections to the proposed project on Wednesday, February 24, 2021.
9 36. The Torrance Community Development Director approved
10 consideration of Baksh's application on May 18, 2021.

11 37. On June 1, 2021 Petitioner notified Torrance of its appeal of the
12| Community Development Director's approval of the Minor Hillside Exemption
929Z6 R ETULIO!IED ESOW Costa ITI HIANTI ONTH :amg 1033S TOISITH OSTE 13 permit for Baksh's proposed "infinity" pool project.

14 38. On August 4, 2021 Petitioner appealed the Community
15 Development Director's approval to the Torrance Planning Commission.
16 Petitioner filed a letter containing various grounds for objection, including

17 infringement of light, air, and privacy rights, as well as environmental

18 concerns about the proposed "infinity" pool. The Planning Commission denied
19 Petitioner's appeal.

20 39. Petitioner noticed an appeal of the Planning Commission's decision
on August 17, 2021 to the Torrance City Council. The City Council initially set
22 the hearing on appeal for September 14, 2021 but continued the hearing to 21

23 October 26, 2021 at Petitioner's request. Petitioner again submitted a letter
24 outlining various objections to the project, along with the SPC Engineering
25 report and documents that had been provided in response to Petitioner's PRA
26 requests.

40. The City Council heard Petitioner's appeal on October 26, 2021 and
28  upheld the Planning Commission's approval of the Minor Hillside Exemption 27

12
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
(CEQA)

with Resolution No. 2021-86. This was the final determination under CEQA
2 and is the action being challenged by this Petition. Petitioner has exhausted its
3 remedies, and any further attempts to pursue administrative remedies with

4 Torrance would be futile.

5 41. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources

6 Code section 21167.5 by sending written notice of the commencement of this
7 action to Respondents prior to filing this petition and complaint. A true and
8 correct copy of this notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.
9 42. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources
10 Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by mailing a copy

11 of the Petition/Complaint to the state Attorney General.

12 43. In pursuing this action, which involves enforcement of important

ING BENDER LLF ozz anmg h3aMS LO1SUg OSDE 97976 CTUIOUTEO 'esajy esog 13 rights affecting the general public and residents of Torrance, Petitioner will be
14 entitled to attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to, inter alia, Code of Civil
15 Procedure section 1021.5.

16

17 First Cause of Action

18 (Writ of Administrative Mandate CCP §1094.5)

19 (Directed to Respondent City of Torrance)

20 44. Petitioner incorporates paragraphs 1 through 43 above as though

21 set forth in full herein.

22 45. The proposed "infinity" pool at 5109 is a project under CEQA

23 because Baksh could not construct the project without a Minor Hillside
24 Exemption permit from Torrance.

25 46. Torrance erroneously applied a categorical exemption to Baksh's
26  proposed "infinity" pool project and did not examine the direct and foreseeable
27 impacts it would have on the hillside environment.

28 47. At a bare minimum, Torrance should have taken into consideration

13
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
(CEQA)

1 the likelihood of the project destabilizing the hillside and increasing the
2 possibility of landslides in the area. Torrance was presented with the following
3 information but did not consider:

4 There are three other mapped landslides on the same subject

5 slope located at distances of 2/10 of a mile, 3/10 of a mile, and 1/2

6 mile from the subject site;

7 The landslide located 2/10 miles from the subject site occurred in

8 1986 and was triggered by the accumulation of subsurface water.
a There was no consideration or study whether an "infinity" pool

10 designed to spill water over its edge on that same slope might

11 create similar subsurface water problems;

12 At least part of the Palos Verdes Fault is mapped to cross the
slope at the site of the proposed "infinity" pool, making seismic I'TI HHCNHI ONII 9Z9Z6 EIUIOJED 'esaJN EISOg ozz 30mS 9330S [OISIA OSTE 13

14 loading a concern. No study or evaluation of this has been

15 completed;

16 The State of California has mapped areas susceptible to earth-

17 quake induced landsliding, and the subject site is within this

18 zone. Again, no study or evaluation of this has been completed.

19

Torrance applied the categorical exemption to the proposed 20
"infinity" pool project knowing it would cause a direct physical change in 48.

22 the environment in knowing disregard of the following information: 21

23 The pool design requires large concrete piles to be sunk into the

24 hillside, but no geotechnical design, report, or investigation was

25 referenced in the plans;

26 Whether there is competent bedrock on the hillside that can

27 support the proposed concrete piles,

28 Will the concrete piles and proposed structure at the top of the

14
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
(CEQA)

H hillside destabilize the entire slope;

2 The 1986 landslide attributed the cause of the landslide to

U, subsurface water and saturation of malaga mudstone. No studies
O u t of the geology beneath the hillside have been performed and
Torrance is aware no studies have been performed;
No analysis of rain or water run-off on the hillside have been

7 performed;

8 No analysis has been performed of soil erosion that will occur by
9 removing the existing ice plants and flora or the consequent

10 impact on the hillside's stability.

11

12 49. These shortcomings are reflected in the City's Staff Reports, the

ITI HAONAS ONTH ozz 21mg 133S LOSEFH OSIE 97976 BIUIOg!ED 'eSaI EISO) 13 Planning Commission's decision, as well as the City Council's ultimate and

14 final decision. At no point in this process has any City official or body made a
15 factual finding relating to the environmental concerns arising from the
16 unusual topography, geography, or landslide risks attendant to this immediate

17 area or the Overlay Zone.

18 50. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary
19 l course of law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require
20 Respondents to set aside the proposed project approvals and Minor Hillside

21 Exemption permit until they have adequately complied with CEQA. In the

22 absence of such remedies, the Torrance's approvals will remain in effect and in

23 violation of CEQA.

24

25 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as follows:

26 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate under the seal of the Court
27 directing the City of Torrance to vacate and set aside its decision on October
28 | 26, 2021 concerning Minor Hillside Exception 20-0186, and to find Resolution

15

5 CEQA;

6 3. For Petitioner's costs and attorneys' fees pursuant to California
7 Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5; and

Subject: LETTER OF FINDINGS
SITE REVIEW AND EVALUATION OF GEOTECHNICAL CONDITIONS
Your Client: The Nagy Trust. 5105 Paseo De Las Tortugas, Torrance, CA 90505 Neighboring Property: 5109 Paseo De Las Tortugas, Torrance, CA 90505

Dear Mr. Bobko:

In accordance with your request, SPC Engineering has performed a site visit at 5105 Paseo De Las
Tortugas on October 6, 2021, and reviewed available documents related to the stability of the rear
descending slope with respect to the proposed pool construction at 5109 Paseo De Las Tortugas,
which is the neighboring property to the left (Photo 1). During our site visit, we performed a visual
inspection of the property, photo-documented existing conditions, and inspected other nearby areas
related to this matter.

The subject site is located southeast of Pacific Coast Highway and Palos Verdes Boulevard in
Torrance, as shown on the attached Vicinity Map, Plate l.

Document Review

Our document research and review included reviewing in-house files (geologic maps, historical
aerial photos, etc.), researched documents, and documents provided by you (see attached List of
References). As part of our document research, public records requests were submitted to the City
of Torrance; however, most of the files had not yet been provided at the time of this report. A
summary of the most pertinent available documents is provided below:

Geologic Conditions
There is an approximately 100-foot-high descending slope at the rear of the site. The rear slope
appears to be comprised of fill at the top (roughly 2:1 h:v inclination), with a natural slope a

685 N. Shepard Street Anaheim California 92806 m (714) 630-0321 m Fax (714) 630-0326

SPC 9141-01
October 20, 2021 Page 2

below likely comprised of older dune deposits, sandy marine sediment, and laminated siltstone
bedrock. The underlying geologic formations in the area have been mapped to comprise an
out-of-slope geologic structure that is prone to landsliding (Dibblee, 1999).

There are three other mapped slope failures on the same subject slope located at distances of
0.22 miles, 0.35 miles, and 0.53 miles from the subject site, as shown on the attached Landslide
Inventory Map, Plate 2. The landslide located 0.22 miles from the subject site occurred in
1986, and reportedly was triggered by subsurface water (LA Times, 1987). Additionally, the
Palos Verdes Fault is mapped to cross the slope at the site, making susceptibility to seismic
loading a concern.

The State of California has mapped areas susceptible to earthquake-induced landsliding, and
the rear slope is mapped within the carthquake-induced landsliding zone, as shown on the
attached Earthquake-Induced Landslide Zones, Plate 3.

Swimming Pool Drawings - 5109 Paseo De Las Tortugas
Design drawings for the proposed swimming pool were reviewed for the 5109 address (MAD
Design, 2020). The swimming pool structure is planned to extend over the top of the rear
slope, and be supported on 30-inch diameter concrete piles (cast-in-drilled hole)that are to be
connected with 24 to 30-inch-deep concrete grade beams. No geotechnical design, report, or
investigation was referenced in the plans.

For the "Pile Schedule" on Sheet S2, it is not clear whether "Depth (Bedrock)" refers to "depth
to bedrock" or "embedment depth into bedrock." This is an important distinction for
construction quality assurance. Additionally, the possibility of weathered bedrock or weak
planes within the bedrock is not considered in the plan set. The term "competent bedrock"
would be appropriate rather than "bedrock." It is unknown at this time whether the proposed
construction meets the geotechnical requirements, such as slope stability, fill density and
susceptibility to settlement, proper embedment of foundations into competent bedrock, soil
strength parameters, horizontal setback distance, slope creep loads, lateral earth pressures, and
others.

Observations

A site visit was performed on October 6, 2021, and a summary of our findings is as follows:

5105/5109 Paseo De Las Tortugas

M The rear, top-of-slope wall has rotated downslope, and has separated from the right
property line wall by up to 3 1/4 inches (Photos 2, 3).
The left property line wall has experienced separation and cracking up to 18 feet from the
rear top-of-slope wall (Photos 4 through 6).
On the slope, the near surface soil appeared to be sandy and prone to erosion (Photos 7, 8).

Landslide Repair Between Via Corona & Vista Largo

In 1986, a landslide destroyed two residences on the same slope, located 0.22 miles to the
east of the subject properties (Photos 9, 10). The landslide repair is visible from the streets
above and below.

Conclusions

Based on site observations, review of available information, engineering evaluation and analysis,
and professional experience and judgment, we conclude that the proposed swimming pool
construction at 5109 Paseo De Las Tortugas should be rationally designed based on a geotechnical
investigation and design parameters. A geotechnical investigation is warranted, considering the
geologic history of the site with significant slope stability problems, as well as to identify the
geotechnical parameters for design. More specifically:
There are three landslides that have been recorded on the same slope within about 1/2-mile
of the site (including one that destroyed two residences in 1986, triggered by subsurface
water), indicating geologic vulnerability and propensity to slope failures. Additionally, the
slope is located within a state-mapped zone of areas susceptible to earthquake-induced
landsliding.

The proposed swimming pool structure is planned to be supported on deep foundations
embedded into bedrock; however, based on the design drawings, there are no indications

Civil • Geotechnical • Environmental SPC ENGINEERING

SPC 9141-01 Page 4
October 20, 2021

that the foundations were rationally designed. Deep foundations in this application should
be designed to consider lateral loading (slope creep, lateral earth pressures), downdrag
loading from fill settlement, depth to bedrock, and design parameters for the bedrock.
None of these items appcar to have been addressed as part of the foundation design.
Furthermore, a subsurface investigation is critical in order to identify any weak layers or
clay seams that could be a slip surface within the formation, resulting in landsliding. Any
foundation embedment into competent bedrock should be below any potential slip surface.
During our site visit, we observed signs of slope creep at the top of the slope. If the
proposed swimming pool foundations are not designed properly and are not sufficiently
embedded into competent bedrock, the swimming pool structure will be susceptible to
downslope movement. Upon downslope movement, the pool plumbing would be prone to
failure, endangering the stability of the rear slope. This is particularly important for a leak
at the rear of the backyard, which could go unnoticed. Additionally, if the pool is subjected
to downslope movement and rotation, the hardscape may be altered to not flow as designed
to the drainage system (catch basin), and result in water draining onto the slope.
A potential slope failure would likely extend beyond the limits of the pool, and into the
adjacent properties, and the possibility that the residential structures may be affected should
be seriously considered. A proper subsurface geotechnical investigation and design is
warranted to reduce risk to the subject and surrounding properties.

INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO COMPLETE THE COVER SHEET CM-010
To Plaintiffs and Others Filing First Papers. If you are filing a first paper (for example, a complaint) in a civil case, you must complete and file, along with your first paper, the Civil Case Cover Sheet contained on page 1. This information will be used to compile statistics about the types and numbers of cases filed. You must complete items through 6 on the sheet. In item 1, you must check one box for the case type that best describes the case. If the case fits both a general and a more specific type of case listed in item 1. check the more specific one. If the case has multiple causes of action, check the box that best indicates the primary cause of action. To assist you in completing the sheet, examples of the cases that belong under each case type in item 1 are provided below. A cover sheet must be filed only with your initial paper. Failure to file a cover sheet with the first paper filed in a civil case may subject a party, its counsel, or both to sanctions under rules 2.30 and 3.220 of the California Rules of Court. of To Parties in Rule 3.740 Collections Cases. A "collections case" under rule 3.740 is defined as an action for recovery of money owed in a sum stated to be certain that is not more than $25,000, exclusive of interest and attorney's fees, arising from a transaction in which property, services, or money was acquired on credit. A collections case does not include an action seeking the following: (1) tort damages, (2) punitive damages, (3) recovery of real property, (4) recovery of personal property, or (5) a prejudgment writ of attachment. The identification of a case as a rule 3.740 collections case on this form means that it will be exempt from the general time-for-service requirements and case management rules, unless a defendant files a responsive pleading. A rule 3.740 collections case will be subject to the requirements for service and obtaining a judgment in rule 3.740.
To Parties in Complex Cases. In complex cases only, parties must also use the Civil Case Cover Sheet to designate whether the
case is complex. If a plaintiff believes the case is complex under rule 3.400 of the California Rules of Court, this must be indicated by completing the appropriate boxes in items 1 and 2. If a plaintiff designates a case as complex, the cover sheet must be served with the
complaint on all parties to the action. A defendant may file and serve no later than the time of its first appearance a joinder in the
plaintiff's designation, a counter-designation that the case is not complex, or, if the plaintiff has made no designation, a designation that
the case is complex. CASE TYPES AND EXAMPLES
