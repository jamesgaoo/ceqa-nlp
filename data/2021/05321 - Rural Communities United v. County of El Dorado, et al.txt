Plaintiff alleges:

2 Respondents County of El Dorado and El Dorado County Board of Supervisors ("Respondent" or
3 "County") violated the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), Public Resources Code §§ 21000
4 et seq., when it adopted Resolution 164-2020, on or about October 20, 2020, by which it re-certified or

5 adopted a supplemental certification to the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the El Dorado

6 County Biological Resources Policy Update; Oak Resources Management Plan and Ordinance and
re-approved the El Dorado County Biological Resources Policy Update; Oak Resources Management

u 8 Plan and Ordinance. The grounds for this lawsuit are that the County was required to re-circulate its
30;9 revisions to the EIR as required by CEQA section 21092.1 and CEQA Guideline Section 15088.5. G
Parties

: 2. Plaintiff RURAL COMMUNITIES UNITED ("RCU") is an unincorporated association of 11 individuals and their families who live or own property in the Sierra Nevada foothill region of El Dorado
12 At! Tn County formed to protect the region's environment and quality of life and to pass that on to newcomers
1 4% and future generations. RCU and its members are beneficially interested in obtaining the writ sought in 14 this case because they will be adversely affected by the Project in that the Project will lead to increased
15 real estate development in the County, with numerous consequences, including loss of wildlife habitat,
16: increased traffic and traffic congestion, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. RCU and its members
17 are beneficially interested in Respondent's full compliance with CEQA in the adoption of the Project.
18 RCU has the right to enforce the mandatory duties of CEQA.
119 3: Respondent COUNTY OF EL DORADO is a public entity, a political subdivision of the State of
:20 California and a local public agency as defined in the California Environmental Quality Act.
Respondent EL DORADO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS is the public entity charged with

22 oversight of all operations of Respondent EL DORADO COUNTY. Respondents COUNTY OF EL

23 DORADO and EL DORADO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS are collectively referred to

24 herein as "Respondent" or "County." Respondent owed a mandatory duty to comply with CEQA before

25 approving the Project.

6. This Court has jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 or 1094.5 and Public

5 Resources Code section 21168 or 21168.5.
General Allegations

7N The County adopted its 2004 General Plan along with a program EIR (2004 PEIR). The PEIR:

8 detérmined that the proposed General Plan buildout by 2025 would have "significant and unavoidable"
impacts a on a host of biological resources, including oak woodland habitat and dependent wildlife. i
9
•1•

10 To avoid or substantially lessen the impacts of development on oak woodland habitat, the

11 General Plan adopted a series of policies designed to "fully mitigate the effects of important habitat 16ss*

12 and fragmentation," and to require project applicants proposing to eliminate oak woodlands entirely on a
parcel to pay into a "mitigation fund" adequate to. "fully compensate for the impact to oak woodland
13 habitat," which the PEIR describes as "existing woodlands of equal or greater biological value as those
14. lost." This policy was known as Option B, which required a 2:1 replacement ratio necessary to
15 compensate for fragmentation as well as habitat loss. Option B required that the "[i]mpacts on
r:16 woodland habitat and mitigation requirements [would] be addressed in a Biological Resources Study and :;

17 Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan [INRMP]." The 2004 General Plan Policy required,
118. within five years of General Plan adoption, the development of the INRMP, which was to identify
'19 (*"Important" wildlife habitat and establish a program for effective habitat preservation and management:

20 The INRMP was to include a "Habitat Protection Strategy" for protecting important habitat based on :f*•

21 coordinated land acquisitions and management of acquired land. The goal of the strategy shall be to 1AL.

'22 conserve and restore contiguous blocks of important habitat to offset the effects of increased habitat loss

23 and fragmentation elsewhere in the County. The 2004 General Plan required the County to adopt the 1

24 INRMP by 2009.
9.
25 The 2004 General Plan was legally challenged, resulting in a settlement in which the County

26 agreed that the clearing of oak woodlands pursuant to Option B would not be permitted until the County

27 had adopted the "oak woodland portion of the Integrated Natural Resources Management Plan described
in General Plan Policy 7.4.2.8," referred to as the Oak Woodland Management Plan (OWMP).
28 10. The County's OWMP was subsequently legally challenged based on the County's failure to

comply with CEQA. In Center for Sierra Nevada Conservation v. County of El Dorado (2012) 202
2 Cal.App.4th 1156, the Court of Appeal overturned the County's approval of the OWMP, finding that the
3 County had failed to examine how mitigation standards and policies contained in the plan could avoid or
4 substantially lessen the significant impacts to oak woodland habitat identified in the PEIR.

5 11. Following adoption of the OWMP, the County continued work on the INRMP, which was

6 divided into two phases. Phase focused on fact-finding, organizing, and analyzing the scientific and
regulatory facts related to oak woodland habitat preservation. Phase 2 was to entail the development of t
draft INRMP with recommendations on the required environmental review pursuant to CEQA.
12.
9 The County completed Phase 1 of the INRMP in 2011, which included the compilation of

10 baseline conditions. However, the County subsequently decided not to proceed with Phase 2 and to drop

11 the INRMP requirement altogether due to their limiting effect on development in the County. Instead, in
2012, the County Board proposed to amend the General Plan without conducting any important oak
12 woodland habitat assessment.
13 13: In 2015, the County approved amendments to General Plan policies and land use designations
14 and an update of the Zoning Ordinance (TGPA-ZOU) and certified a program EIR (2015 TGPA-ZOU
15 Program EIR). The County chose not to include the proposed General Plan policy amendments related
16| to oak woodlands as part of its approval of the TGPA/ZOU.
17 14. In 2016, the County proposed a Biological Resource Policy Update, Oak Resources Management
18 Plan (ORMP) and Oak Resources Conservation Ordinance (together, the Initial Project) and issued a
19 draft program EIR (DEIR) for public review and comment. In February of 2017, the County issued the

20 final program EIR (EIR) for the proposed Project.

21 15. On October 24, 2017, the County approved the Project and certified the EIR. The Initial Project

22 substantially amended the General Plan policies formerly adopted as part of the 2004 General Plan to

23 protect oak woodlands. The Initial Project eliminated Policy 7.4.1.6, Option B of Policy 7.4.4.4, and

24 amended Policy 7.4.2.8 to eliminate the requirement that the County prepare the INRMP. For oak

25 woodlands, the new ORMP established the mitigation required to develop parcels containing oak
woodland habitat.
26 16. The EIR purported to asses the environmental impacts of the TGPA-ZOU buildout scenarios for
27 the years 2025 and 2035 as modified by the Initial Project. The EIR analyzed the impacts of
28 development that can be expected to occur as a result of allowing developers to clear oak woodlands

1 under the TGPA-ZOU and ORMP development standards in buildout scenarios for the years 2025 and
2 2035. The EIR was not tiered to any prior program EIR.
3 17. The EIR found that the Initial Project's impacts to oak woodlands and associated wildlife due to
habitat loss and fragmentation are significant and unavoidable. In making this finding , the County
chose a oak woodland habitat protection strategy intended to preserve oak woodlands in rural areas of

6 the County, but not in the areas along the County's Highway 50 corridor (Corridor) where most of the

7 future development is expected to occur. The County's decision not to acquire and/or preserve oak

8 woodland habitat within the Corridor ensures that future development will have significant impact due

9 to the loss of north-south habitat connectivity for wildlife dependent upon oak woodlands. The EIR,

10 however, found that this significant impact was unavoidable without having assessed the feasability of a

11 conservation strategy that would protect some oak woodland habitat within the Corridor.
18. Plaintiff challenged the Initial Project in EI Dorado Superior Court on November 21, 2017,
12 alleging in part that the County's EIR had failed to adequately assess the impacts of allowing for the
13 clearing of oak woodlands in the Corridor, and, in particular, had failed to assess the feasibility of an oak
14 woodland habitat preservation strategy within the Corridor that would avoid or substantially lessen
15 north-south habitat connectivity for wildlife dependent on oak woodlands.
16 19. On April 27, 2020, the Court granted Plaintiff's Petition for writ of mandate ("Ruling"), holding
17 that "the portion of the FEIR/EIR related to the determination of where to focus mitigation of loss of oak
18 woodlands . whether to focus on Highway 50 corridor land to maintain full connectivity between north
19 and south oak woodland habitats as asserted by Plaintiff, or to focus on Priority Conservation Areas
20 | ("PCAs") in rural areas that are not in the impact areas, as decided by the County," did not comply with

21 CEQA in that the County's findings were not supported by substantial evidence. The Ruling also found

22 that the reports or memos containing the County's biological experts' opinion or the studies cited in

23 support of the County's determination related to the focus of where the preservation or replanting of oak

24 woodlands will take place were not in the administrative record. The Ruling decertified the EIR "as it

25 relates to the County's determination that focusing on preservation of oak woodlands habitat in the
Highway 50 Corridor was not the best course
26 of action and it was not feasible to focus on preserving the

27 oak woodlands within the Highway 50 corridor." The Ruling required the County to "comply with
CEQA provisions concerning inclusion of the studies and opinions referenced in the evidence in the
28 administrative record" which were "relied on by the County in determining whether to focus on

1 Highway 50 corridor land to maintain full connectivity between north and south oak woodland habitats

2 ...or to focus on PCAs in rural areas that are not in the impact areas." The Ruling found that "the
3 approval of construction and issuance of Oak Woodland removal permits in the defined Highway 50
4 corridor pending the return to the writ will prejudice the consideration or implementation of particular

5 mitigation measures or alternatives to the project" and thus suspended all County approvals until the
County has completed its CEQA review process and entered an adequate return on the Court's writ. The

7 Ruling stated that this "will protect the oak woodlands habitat in north-south corridors that would then
be available to limit development, and/or purchase and preserve should the return to the writ include a

9 determination by the County that the project will also be mitigated by preserving Highway 50
north-south corridors."
10 20.
11 The Ruling was subsequently memorialized into a final judgment and writ of mandate dated July
27, 2020. The writ of mandate required the County Board of Supervisors to "partially decertify the EIR
12 only as it relates to the County's determinations that focusing on preservation of oak woodlands habitat
13 in the Highway 50 corridor was not the best course of action and that it was not feasible to focus on
14 preserving the oak woodland within the 50 corridor" and to "augment the administrative record with the 15 reports and opinions omitted from the administrative record," as referenced in the Ruling.
16 21. On October 20, 2020, the County Board of Supervisors de-certified the EIR, considered new
17 information and findings related to the issue of oak woodland habitat fragmentation, re-certified the EIR
18 as adequate under CEQA and approved the Project. The County's action were based on a new staff
19 report, a memo from the County's EIR consultant Dudek, new studies relating to habitat fragmentation

20 (included as exhibits to the Dudek Memo), and a new Resolution 164-2020 supporting the County's

21 action in re-certifying the EIR. In addition, the County directed staff to augment the administrative

22 record of the Initial Project litigation with the new studies attached to the Dudek memo.

23 22. In approving the Project, the County did not re-circulate the EIR for public comment and review,

24 nor did the County attempt to comply with CEQA's requirements for re-circulating EIRs.
23.
25 On October 29, 2020, the County filed a motion to discharge the Writ of Mandate, based on its
re-approval of the Project and re-certification of the EIR on October 20, 2020.
26 24. On December 23, 2020, the Court denied the County's motion without prejudice based on the
27 holding that the Court lacked jurisdiction to consider the County's compliance with the terms of the writ
28 of mandate due to the pending appeals of the Court's ruling on the merits.

Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies
3 25. Plaintiff exhausted all available administrative remedies in that the County's approval of the

4 Initial Project and the Project is final and not subject to further administrative appeal procedures.

5 26. In accord with Public Resources Code section 21177, subdivision (b), Plaintiff objected to the

6 approval of the Project orally or in writing prior to the close of the public hearing and prior to the

7 County's approval of the Project,

9 non-compliance with CEQA that are alleged herein were presented to the County prior to the close of the
public hearing on the Project.
10 28. In the alternative, there was no opportunity for members of the public to raise the grounds of 11 noncompliance alleged in this Complaint and Petition prior to the County's adoption of the Project. 12 Notices

violation of CEQA, Public Resources Code section 21168.5, and Code of Civil Procedure section 1085.
2 34. In approving the Project and re-certifying the EIR, the County failed to re-circulate its revisions

3 to the EIR as required by CEQA section 21092.1 and CEQA Guideline section 15088.5, before re-
certifying the EIR. Instead, the County adopted a new resolution with a new finding that "it was not
5 feasible to focus on preserving the oak woodlands within the Highway 50 corridor," which was based on

6 a new opinion by the County's consultant (Dudek memorandum) purporting to explain how twelve (12)
studies not included in the record of proceedings constitute "substantial evidence" supporting this new

8 finding as well as the County's prior finding rejecting Alternative 2 of a "Minimum Oak Woodland

On Retention Requirement" of 30% oak woodland retention on each developed parcel.a:
