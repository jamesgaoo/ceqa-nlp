FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Petitioner PROTECTING THE CHILDREN OF ORCHARD SCHOOL ("Petitioner")
2 brings this action for writ of mandate under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA")
3 ("Petition") on behalf of Petitioner's interested members and residents, and in the public interest.

4 INTRODUCTION

5 1. On June 9, 2020, the City of San Jose ("City" or "Respondent") passed resolution
6 No. 79559 (*Resolution") certifying the Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") for its
7 | Charcot Avenue Extension Project (*Project"), making certain findings regarding significant
8 impacts, adopting a statement of overriding considerations, and adopting a mitigation monitoring
9 and reporting program.

10 2. The Project seeks to extend Charcot Avenue from its eastern boundary at Paragon

11 Drive over Interstate 880 (*I-880") to Oakland Road in the North San Jose area. This would
12 include an approximately .6 mile-long two-lane extension and an overcrossing, sidewalks,
13 bikeways, and intersection modifications.

14 3. This Project has been on the City's plans for over 26-years, yet the environmental
15 review itself shows that the Project serves no particular current need and that the Project would
16 lead to thousands of additional cars passing a few feet away from Orchard School's ("School")
17 classrooms, baseball field and elementary school playground, causing significant environmental

18 effects.

19 4. Beholden to this antiquated plan, the City failed to properly consider alternatives to
20 the Project, and relied on an unduly narrow set of project purposes and objectives.

21 5. The FEIR, and the statement of overriding considerations in the Resolution, are
22 deficient and legally inadequate under CEQA as an informational document in numerous respects

23 as alleged herein. California courts repeatedly have held that CEQA must be scrupulously

24 followed in order to afford the "fullest protection to the environment." Moreover, "[a]n EIR must
25 include detail sufficient to enable those who did not participate in its preparation to understand and
26 to consider meaningfully the issues raised by the proposed project."

27

28

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

6. The Court should therefore issue a peremptory writ of mandate, vacating
2 Respondents' approvals of the FEIR and Project, unless and until the Project can be brought into
3 compliance with law.

4 THE PARTIES

5 7. Petitioner PROTECTING THE CHILDREN OF ORCHARD SCHOOL is an

6 unincorporated association dedicated to the protection of the students of Orchard School.
7 Members of Petitioner group commented in opposition to the Project for its numerous CEQA
8 I deficiencies and deleterious significant effects to public health and welfare.

9 8. Respondent CITY OF SAN JOSE is a city of California and is the "lead agency"
10 that prepared and certified the FEIR, and approved the Project.

11 9. The true names and capacities of the Respondents named here as DOES I through
12 100, inclusive, are presently unknown to Petitioner. As such, Petitioner has sued these
13 Respondents by fictitious names, and Petitioner will seek to amend this Petition to show their true

14 names and capacities when ascertained.

15 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

16 10. This Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set aside Respondents'
17 actions and decisions relating to the FEIR and Project, and to compel Respondents to comply with
18 CEQA under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and California Public Resources

19 Code section 21168.5.

20 11. This Court has jurisdiction to issue an order for injunctive relief pursuant to
21 California Code of Civil Procedure section 525 et seq.

22 12. Venue is proper in the County of Santa Clara under California Code of Civil
23 Procedure section 393 and 401 and California Government Code section 955.3.

24 NOTICE REQUIREMENTS AND TIMING

25 13. The City filed a Notice of Determination regarding its certification of the FEIR on
26 June 11, 2020.

27

28

2
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

14. Pursuant to Judicial Council of California's emergency rule 9, amended effective
2 May 29, 2020, "Notwithstanding any other law, the statutes of limitations and repose for civil
3 causes of action that are 180 days or less are tolled from April 6, 2020, until August 3, 2020.

4 Advisory Committee Comment to emergency rule 9 states that 9 "Emergency rule 9 is intended to
5 apply broadly to toll any statute of limitations on the filing of a pleading in court asserting a civil

6 cause of action" which includes "all the types of petitions for writ made for California

7 Environmental Quality (CEQA) and land use challenges." Thus, here, the statute of limitations did
8 not begin to run until August 3, 2020.

9 15. Petitioner filed this action within the applicable statute of limitation as required by
10 California Public Resources Code section 21167(c).

11 16. On August 26, 2020, prior to commencing this action, Petitioner served
12 Respondents with written notice of Petitioner's intent to commence this action under CEQA, and
13 thus Petitioner has complied with the requirements of California Public Resources Code section
14 21167.5. Copies of that written notice and proof of service are attached as Exhibit A.
15 17. On September 1, 2020, Petitioner provided to the Attorney General of the State of
16 California notice of the filing of this Petition and copy thereof. On April 28, 2021, Petitioner
17 provided to the Attorney General notice and copy of this First Amended Petition. Thus, Petitioner
18 has complied with the requirements of California Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and
19 California Code of Civil Procedure section 388. A copy of these notices are attached as Exhibit B.
20 ADDITIONAL STANDING ALLEGATIONS

21 18. Petitioner and its respective members and residents live in the areas included in,
22 and that will otherwise be affected by the Project, and use the areas affected by the Project for
23 recreational and educational purposes.

24 19. Petitioner and its respective members and residents are directly and beneficially
25  interested in Respondents' mandatory duty to fully comply with CEQA, and Petitioner and its
26 respective members and residents are directly and beneficially interested in, and aggrieved by, the
27 acts, decisions, and omissions of Respondents as alleged in this Petition.
28

3
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

20. Petitioner and its respective members and residents have articulated their concerns
2 about and objections to the Project and FEIR to Respondents. Petitioner has exhausted any and all
3  available administrative remedies to the extent required by law. Respondents' determinations are

4 final and no further administrative appeal procedures are provided by state or local law. Petitioner

5 and its respective members and residents, as well as many other organizations and public entities,
6 presented detailed and specific objections to the Project and FEIR orally at public meetings and
7 hearings during the public comment period. These objections include each of the legal deficiencies
8 asserted in this Petition.

9 21. Petitioner does not have a plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course
10 of law. Without the requested mandatory and injunctive relief, Petitioner and its respective
11 members and residents will be irreparably harmed by implementation of the Project and by
12 Respondents' violations of CEQA. Such harm cannot be adequately compensated by money or
13 other legal remedies.

14 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

15 22. Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to California
16 Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce
17 important rights affecting the public interest.

18 23. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer significant benefits on
19 the general public by, among other benefits: 1) requiring Respondents to properly disclose,
20 analyze and mitigate the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of the Project that were not
21  properly disclosed, analyzed or mitigated, 2) ensuring that Respondents properly consider
22 alternatives and/or mitigation measures to reduce or avoid the Project's potentially significant,
23 adverse environmental effects, 3) requiring Respondents to implement all feasible alternatives and
24 mitigation measures to avoid such adverse effects or reduce them to less-than-significant levels,
25 and 4) ensuring that Respondents afford the public and affected agencies with the opportunity to
26 review and comment on potentially significant project impacts, and receiving : meaningful and
27 complete response to any such comments on such issues, prior to the approval of such Project.
28

4
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

P

24. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will result in the enforcement of
2 important rights affecting the public interest. By compelling Respondents to complete a legally
3 adequate analysis of the Project, to protect public health and natural resources, Respondents will

4 be required to properly and publicly disclose and analyze all of the Project's potentially

5 significant, adverse environmental effects, and to ensure that all feasible mitigation measures or

6 alternatives that would reduce or avoid the Project's potentially significant, adverse environmental
7 impacts are implemented.

8 25. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make an award of

0 attorneys' fees appropriate in this proceeding. Absent enforcement by Petitioner, the Project might
10 otherwise be deemed valid despite its legally and factually inadequate disclosures, analysis,
11 conclusions, mitigation measures, and alternatives, among other things, and, as a result, potentially
12 significant, adverse environmental effects might otherwise have evaded legally adequate
13 environmental review and mitigation in accordance with the California Legislature's policy, in
14 adopting CEQA, of affording the greatest protections to the environment within the scope of the
15 statute.

16 26. Petitioner has served a copy of this Petition on the Attorney General's office to
17 give notice of Petitioner's intent to bring this proceeding as private attorneys general under Code
18 of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, attached as Exhibit B.

19 LEGAL FRAMEWORK

20 27. CEQA has two purposes: environmental protection and informed self-government.
21 Woodward Park Homeowners Assn., Inc. v. City of Fresno, 150 Cal.App.4th 683, 690-691 (2007).
22 CEQA is "to be interpreted to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the
23 reasonable scope of the statutory language." Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com., 16
24 Cal.4th 105, 134 (1997). CEQA requires agencies to "take all action necessary to protect,
25 rehabilitate, and enhance the environmental quality of the state." Pub. Resources Code, §
26 21001(a).

27

28

5
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

28. Pursuant to CEQA, a "project" is an activity which may cause either direct physical
2 change in the environment, or reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment
3 (Pub. Resources Code § 21065(a)); and a "discretionary" project is one that is subject to is
4  judgmental controls, where the agency can use its judgment to decide whether and how to carry
5 out a project. Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, ch. 3 ("CEQA Guidelines"), § 15002(i). Prior to approving §

6 any discretionary project, an agency must fully disclose and analyze all of the project's potentially
7 significant direct, indirect, and cumulative environmental effects. See, e.g., CEQA Guidelines
8 15002(f)). Further, public agencies must avoid or minimize such environmental damage where
9 feasible. CEQA Guidelines § 15021(a). Pursuant to this duty, no public agency may approve or

10 carry a out a project where one or more significant effects on the environment may occur if the
11 project is approved, unless certain narrow findings are made. CEQA Guidelines §§ 15091, 15093.
12 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

13 29. On April 30, 2018, the Notice of Preparation ("NOP") of the EIR was issued for
14 public review.

15 30. In August of 2019, the City released the Draft Environmental Impact Report
16 | ("DEIR") for a 69-day review period from August 27, 2019 to November 4, 2019.
17 31. On or about May 27, 2020, the City released a "First Amendment to the Draft
18 EIR." As stated therein, "This document, together with the Draft Environmental Impact Report"
19 "constitutes the Final Environmental Report."

20 32. The Project seeks to extend Charcot Avenue from its eastern boundary at Paragon
21 Drive over I-880 to Oakland Road in the North San Jose area. This would include an
22 approximately .6 mile-long two-lane extension and an overcrossing, sidewalks and bikeways, and
23 intersection modifications.

24 33. The FEIR characterizes the a project as a "major roadway improvement," yet in
25 response to comments characterizes the Project as not being a "major roadway improvement" and
26 as "local serving."

27

28

6
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

34. The City asserts that the Project would, in part, implement an existing City of San
2 Jose settlement agreement with Santa Clara County, City of Santa Clara, and City of Milpitas,
3 without disclosing these agreements as part of the whole of the Project, or assessing the effects of
4 implementing these agreements.

35. The EIR identifies the North San Jose Area Development Policy, and the North San
6 Jose Deficiency Plan ("NSJADP"), as key to the Project's goals and objectives, but the EIR fails
7 to describe the underlying purposes identified in the NSJADP, or to assess whether the Project
8 would satisfy those purposes, which it would not.

9 36. The EIR's project objectives are unclear, too narrow, and/or inconsistently applied.
10 The EIR states:

11 The purpose of extending Charcot Avenue across I-880 is to provide a safe multi-modal
12 facility, improve connectivity for vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian travel routes, provide
13 the opportunity to utilize alternative travel modes, and reduce travel time for the east-west
14 travelers in the North San José Area.

15 The objectives for the proposed project are as follows:
16 Improve connectivity between the east side of 1-880 and the west side of I-880;
17 Increase the capacity for east/west travel across the I-880 corridor;
18 Provide a safe bicycle/pedestrian facility over I-880, in compliance with San José's
19 Complete Strects Policy;
20 Implement programmed roadway network improvement project identified in the
21 Envision San José 2040 General Plan; and

22 Implement a planned major roadway improvement project, as set forth in the North San
23 José Area Development Policy and the North San José Deficiency Plan.
24 37. Elsewhere, however, the EIR reveals that the City believes only an automobile
25 serving alternative would meet most of the Project's objectives, which is untrue, and reveals that
26 two of the Project objectives are unduly narrow for purposes of CEQA review, or to meet the
27 Project's stated goals. Even worse, however, the EIR fails to demonstrate that the selected Project
28

7
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 alternative would even serve the Project's goals or objectives, stating that "[t]he proposed

2 extension will provide little to no measurable travel time savings" for drivers, although the EIR
3 provides several contradictory remarks on this point.

4 38. The DEIR did not exclude Alternative E, "New Overcrossing for Bicycles and
5 Pedestrians Only," as infeasible, and suggested that it may have the fewest adverse environmental
6 effects. However, the FEIR rejected Alternative E as the environmentally superior alternative,
7 despite comments that Alternative E could meet more than one project objective, contrary to the
8 City's position.
9 39. The FEIR itself has numerous problems with how it is organized and presented. For
10 example, the air quality and greenhouse gas analysis contained 140 pages of non-indexed tables,
11 as well as missing citations to data and thus there was no reasonable way to further evaluate the
12 results.

13 40. The description of baseline conditions did not take existing conditions and hazards
14 to pedestrians in and around the Project area, and specifically on Fox Lane, into account because
15 the City did not consider them to be required under CEQA. The City did not accurately describe
16 the existing conditions of the Silk Wood Lane and Fox Lane student pick-up and drop-off areas,
17 and neglected to assess effects related to shifting student drop-off and pick-up locations.

18 41. The DEIR states that while "the project would impact the ability to drop-off/pick-
19 up students on Silk Wood Lane, it is likely that students would continue to cross Charcot
20 Avenue/Silk Wood Lane as they walk between the School and the neighborhood to the North."
21 The City therefore concedes an impact on students, yet the FEIR does not evaluate or mitigate this
22 impact and instead asserts that "the project's impacts to school drop-off/pick-up activities ... are
23 non-CEQA items that neither involve a significant adverse environmental impact, nor require
24 mitigation under CEQA." Consistent with this assertion, the FEIR fails to formulate mitigation
25 measures for its self-identified Project impact, and instead offers suggestions as to ways in which

26 the School could reduce the adverse effects of a City-implemented Project.
27 42. The City failed to measure and discuss current pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicle

28

8
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

travel to, from, and in the vicinity of the School, including measuring the number of students who
2 access the School via Charcot Avenue and Silk Wood Lane, and failed to analyze the Project's
3 impact on such travel. As a result, no measurement of current or future activity is provided for use
4 of the extension or crossing the extension to access the School.

43. The traffic report completed for the Project determined that the Project would result
in significant safety impacts at the intersections of Paragon Drive and Charcot Avenue, and
7 O'Toole Avenue and Charcot Avenue. Mitigation measures recommended in the traffic report to
8 ameliorate the safety impact at the identified intersections are not discussed or included in the

9 Project. In response to a comment noting the same, the FEIR states, "the ultimate implementation
10 of the recommendations will be determined and designed upon project approval." This constitutes
11 an impermissible deferral of mitigation measures by the City.
12 44. The City failed to discuss or evaluate existing safety hazards to students based on
13 the proximity of the current roadway to the School, and the extent to which the Project will
14 exacerbate such hazards. The School Superintendent has reported that there have been multiple
15 instances of cars crashing through the School fence from Oakland Road. The Project will result in
16 an increased amount of traffic on that route as cars turn right from Charcot Road to Oakland Road,
17 which will increase the risk of additional accidents, thereby increasing the hazard to students. The
18 FEIR does not address this impact.

19 45. Additionally, the FEIR does not include an analysis of the visibility of the High-
20 Intensity Activated Crosswalk ("HAWK") signal for drivers who will be using the extension and
21 children will be crossing the extension, despite the fact that cars coming downslope on the
22 roadway extension will be headed east and directly into the glare of the morning sun. The DEIR
23 does not analyze whether a HAWK light will be an effective way to protect students who will be
24 walking to the School via Charcot Avenue and Silk Wood Lane.
25 46. Further, the DEIR does not address the possible implementation of any safety
26 measures other than the HAWK light. When questioned in the comment period to the Notice of
27 Preparation about the possible use of crossing guards to mitigate the safety impacts of the Project,
28

9
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

the City improperly deferred any analysis to a future date. The placement of the extension in
2 relation to the Orchard School will result in safety hazards to pedestrians and students, and the
3 City failed to adequately analyze or mitigate such impacts.

4 47. While an analysis of the effects of the Project on School operations and the
5 neighborhood between Silk Wood Lane and Rock Avenue are omitted from the FEIR, CEQA

6 Guidelines state that a Project can create a significant effect if it "[s]ubstantially increases hazards
7 due to a geometric design feature or incompatible use." CEQA Guidelines Appendix G:
8 Environmental Checklist Form, § XVII(c). School area vehicular, bus, pedestrian, bike, and pick-

9 up and drop-off operations, as well as neighborhood traffic operations, all have serious safety
10 | implications and the Project will require modifications to School access for all travel modes as
11 well as its pick-up and drop-off areas and facilities. Such modifications must be analyzed in detail
12 with appropriate mitigation measures identified and implemented.

13 48. The FEIR failed to evaluate effects related to induced demand as a result of
14 increasing roadway capacity. The City's Transportation Analysis Handbook explains that,
15 "[s]hortly after the project becomes operational, induced [Vehicle Miles Traveled] may occur
16 where road users respond to an initial appreciable reduction in travel time. With lower travel
17 times, the modified facility becomes more attractive to travelers." Here, the EIR found a sixty
18 percent decrease in travel time for some users, which would lead to induced demand, though the
19 reduction in travel time is also inconsistent with other findings in the EIR. The fundamental rule of
20 traffic is, building more roads makes people drive more.

21 49. In responding to comments regarding the effect the Project will have on Fox Lane
22 traffic conditions, the FEIR states that the project "would not result in changes to traffic volumes
23 on Fox Lane," while contradicting that representation in the following sentence by asserting that
24 the "subsequent greater use of Fox Lane" as a result of the Project "is the obligation of the school
25 to remedy."

26 50. The FEIR also failed to assess the full scope of traffic effects, arbitrarily limiting
27 the sphere of traffic effects considered to a 1.5 mile radius from the Project, whereas the FEIR's

28

10
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

air quality assessment considers effects at a 2.5 mile radius.

2 51. The FEIR purports to evaluate vehicle miles traveled ("VMT") "for informational
3 purposes only,' claiming VMT analysis is exempted by the City's Transportation Analysis Policy,
4 but the EIR fails to accurately apply the City's transportation policy to the Project, and fails to
5 accurately or fully assess VMT.

6 52. The FEIR states, without substantial evidence, that the Project would result in a
7 decrease in traffic congestions, resulting in a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, neither of
8 which conclusions are supported by substantial evidence in the record, and which are contradicted

0 by evidence in the record.

10 53. The FEIR did not properly evaluate or mitigate significant air quality impacts from
11 the Project.

12 54. According to the EIR itself, the Project would more than double existing PM2.5 air
13 pollution.

14 55. The EIR's own modeling, which was criticized by the Bay Area Air Quality
15 Management District ("BAAQMD"), and which was clearly flawed, estimates that the Project will
16 be extremely close to the BAAQMD threshold of significance for a single project's PM2.5
17 exposure, and proper modeling and analysis would likely have put the project above the
18 BAAQMD threshold.

19 56. Traffic studies undertaken by the City prior to the publication of the EIR showed
20 one and a half times the number of expected automobile trips on the Project, which would result in

21 a significantly worse air quality impact.

22 57. The EIR fails to disclose all air quality modeling assumptions, rendering public
23 review and informed decision-making impossible.

24 58. The EIR proposes sound walls, and acknowledges that such barriers can alter the
25 flow and concentration of air pollution, but fails to explain such effects at the Project site, while
26 determining without substantial evidence that such effects would be less than significant.

27 59. The FEIR fails to evaluate or mitigate significant water quality impacts from the

28
11
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Project to Coyote Creek, a 63.6 mile river that flows through the Santa Clara Valley and which the

2 DEIR describes as being "330 feet west and outside of the project alignment." Federally

3 threatened and California species of concern such as steelhead and western pond turtle are known

4 inhabitants of Coyote Creek, and two sensitive vegetation habitats are located within its banks.
5 Additional traffic on the bridge over Coyote Creek will result in additional toxins entering the
6 waterway. The FEIR determines without analysis or substantial evidence that "[i]mpacts to Coyote

7 Creek will not occur because the project will not construct any improvements within 330 feet of

8 that resource."

9 60. The FEIR did not properly evaluate or mitigate significant noise impacts from the
10 Project.

11 61. The FEIR defers design of noise barriers until after Project approval, but fails to
12 address questions regarding site configuration, calling into question the feasibility of such
13 mitigation.

14 62. The FEIR employs an improper noise level standard for the outside School areas.
15 The FEIR applied Land Use Category 2, described as "Outdoor Sports and Recreation,
16 Neighborhood Parks and Playgrounds" to the exterior levels of the School campus, which

17 considers an exterior noise level of 65 decibels to be "normally acceptable." However, the exterior
18 areas of the School should fall under Land Use Category 3, described as "Schools, Libraries,
19 Museums, Meeting Halls, and Churches," with an exterior noise level of 60 decibels considered to
20 be "normally acceptable."

21 63. The DEIR found the noise increases in the School's outdoor field to be a significant
22 impact and proposed to erect a six-foot noise barrier as a mitigation measure, which the City
23 asserts will reduce noise levels in outdoor play areas to 65 decibels and exterior levels at the
24 primary classrooms to 60 decibels. However, residents of Silk Wood Lane will receive a ten-foot
25 noise barrier, reducing noise levels to 60 decibels or less, while yet other impacted areas will
26 receive an eight-foot noise barrier. The FEIR fails to provide a discussion or an explanation as to
27 why the School's noise barrier is shorter than the others, and why a higher decibel level is deemed

28
12
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 to be acceptable at the School site.

2 64. Further, the FEIR fails to consider noise effects upon the second floor of

3 residences, which would be located well above the sound wall.

4 CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (Violations of CEQA)

6 65. Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations of set forth above, as if fully set

7 forth in this paragraph.

8 66. The City prejudicially abused its discretion in certifying the FEIR. The City did not

9 proceed in the manner required by law and its decisions in approving the Project and certifying the
10 FEIR are not supported by substantial evidence. Pub. Resources Code § 21168.5; Vineyard Area

11 Citizens for Responsible Growth v. City of Rancho Cordova, 40 Cal.4th 412, 426 (Cal. 2007).
12 These legal deficiencies include, without limitation, the following:

13 The Project Description is Vague, Incomplete, and Unstable

14 67. CEQA requires that an EIR include an accurate project description, and that the
15 nature and objective of a project be fully disclosed and fairly evaluated in an EIR. San Joaquin
16 Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced, 149 Cal.App.4th 646, 655 (2007) (SJ Raptor). An EIR
17 should contain a "sufficient degree of analysis to provide decision-makers with information which
18 enables them to make a decision which intelligently takes account of environmental
19 consequences." CEQA Guidelines $ 15151. "An accurate, stable and finite project description is
20 the sine qua non of an informative and legally sufficient EIR." County of Inyo v. City of Los
21 Angeles, 71 Cal. App. 3d 185, 193 (1977). "Only through an accurate view of the project may
22 affected outsiders and public decision makers balance the proposal's benefit against its
23 environmental cost, consider mitigation measures, assess the advantage of terminating the

24 proposal and weigh other alternatives in the balance." Id. at 192-93. A project description may
25 not provide conflicting signals to decision makers and the public about the nature and scope of the
26 project as such a description is fundamentally inadequate and misleading. SJ Raptor, supra, 149
27 Cal. App. 4th at 655-656.

28
13
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

68. The FEIR characterizes the scale of the Project in a contradictory manner,
2 including characterizing the Project as a "major roadway improvement," yet in response to

3 comments characterizes the Project as not being a "major roadway improvement" and as "local

4 serving."

5 69. The FEIR fails to explain the extent to which the Project implements an existing

6 City of San Jose settlement agreement with Santa Clara County, City of Santa Clara, and Milpitas;
7 and fails to analyze consistency with the North San Jose Area Development Policy, which are all

8 part of the whole of the Project, requiring environmental review.

9 The Project Uses Impermissible Project Obiectives

10 70. CEQA requires that an EIR set forth a project's basic objectives. (CEQA
11 Guidelines, § 15124, sub. (b) ['A clearly written statement of objectives will help the lead agency
12 develop a reasonable range of alternatives to evaluate in the EIR and will aid the decision makers
13 in preparing findings or a statement of overriding considerations, if necessary."); Habitat &
14 Watershed Caretakers V. City of Santa Cruz, (2013) 213 Cal. App. 4th 1277, 1299. Project
15 objectives should not be SO narrowly defined that they preclude consideration of reasonable
16| alternatives for achieving the project's underlying purpose. (North Coast Rivers Alliance 1
17 Kawamura (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 647, 668.)
18 71. The FEIR's project objectives are unclear, too narrow, and/or inconsistently
19 applied.
20 72. The project objectives to "Implement a programmed roadway network
21| improvement project identified in the Envision San José 2040 General Plan," and to "Implement a
22 planned major roadway improvement project, as set forth in the North San José Area Development
and the North San José Deficiency Plan," were unduly narrow, as they could only be met 23 Policy
24 by developing an automobile roadway, when other projects could have adequately met the project
25 goals and underlying purposes of the inclusion of the Project in the Envision San José 2040
26 General Plan and North San José Area Development Policy.
27

28
14
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F The FEIR is Inadequate as an Informational Document

2 73. The information in an EIR must not only be sufficient in quantity, but it must be

3 presented a clear manner so as to adequately inform the public and decision makers. "A reader of

4 the FEIR could not reasonably be expected to ferret out an unreferenced discussion . . ., interpret

5 that discussion's unexplained figures without assistance, and spontaneously incorporate them into

6 the FEIR's own discussion of total projected supply and demand." Vineyard Area Citizens for
7 Responsible Growth, Inc. V. City of Rancho Cordova, 40 Cal.4th 412, 442 (2007). Information
8 scattered throughout an EIR and its appendices and supporting reports are not substitutes for good
faith reasoned analysis. Ibid. An EIR should be written in a way that readers are not forced "to sift
10 through" to find important components of the analysis. SJ Raptor, supra, 149 Cal.App.4th at 659.
11 74. Here, the EIR is disorganized, relevant information is inaccessible, and the analysis
12 is incomplete. Relevant data and assumptions regarding air, noise, and traffic effects are difficult if

13 not impossible to locate; descriptions of the Project itself vary significantly throughout the
14 documents; and understanding and application of the Project's goals and objectives are
15 inconsistent and ambiguous.

16 The FEIR Fails to Adequately Define the Project's Baseline

17 75. In order to determine whether a project's impacts will be significant, CEQA
18 requires lead agencies to compare the impact of a proposed project to the "physical environmental
19 conditions in the vicinity of the project, as they exist at the time the notice of preparation is
20 published." These conditions serve as the project's "baseline." CEQA Guidelines § 15125. The
21 description of the project's baseline ensures that the public has "an understanding of the
22 significant effects of the proposed project and its alternatives." CEQA Guidelines § 15125(a).
23 Accurately determining the baseline environmental conditions is crucial to accurately evaluating a
24 project's impact. E.g., San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Ctr. v. County of Stanislaus, 27
25 Cal.App.4th 713 (1994).

26 76. The FEIR's description of baseline conditions is alternatively incomplete and
27 inaccurate, infecting and invalidating the entirety of the EIR's environmental analysis. The flaws
28
15
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- include, but are not limited to:

2 A.

3 Failure to sufficiently address baseline existing hazards to pedestrians and

students;

4 B.

5 Failure to discuss current vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle traffic to, from,

6 and in the vicinity of the School, including student pick-up and drop-off

areas;

7 C.

8 Incomplete and inadequate discussion and misrepresentation of current

9 roadway traffic conditions and current causes of congestion, making it

10 impossible to independently assess the plausibility of the results of the

11 theoretical traffic modelling and whether the project meets its underlying

purpose.

12

13 The FEIR Fails to Adequately Analyze Significant Environmental Impacts

77. CEQA requires that an EIR describe the proposed project's significant
14 environmental effects. Each must be revealed and fully analyzed in the EIR. Pub. Resources Code
15 § 21100(b), CEQA Guidelines § 15126.2(a).

16 78. The FEIR fails to provide decision makers with sufficient analysis in numerous
17 respects, as discussed, above: induced vehicle demand, VMT, air pollution, greenhouse gasses,
18 water quality impacts, noise impacts, impacts to pedestrian and student safety, and traffic effects
19 to Fox Lane.

20 The FEIR's Project Alternatives Analysis Is Inadequate

21 79. The FEIR must "consider a reasonable range of potentially feasible alternatives that
22 will foster informed decision making and public participation." CEQA Guidelines $ 15126.6.

23 80. The FEIR improperly rejected Alternative E as the environmentally superior
24 alternative, through misapplication of both facts and law.

25 81. The Statement of Overriding Consideration, in turn, failed to include a defensible
26 legal rationale supported by any evidence in its decision to reject Alternative E as the E
27 environmentally superior alternative.

28
16
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

The FEIR's Mitigation Measures are Legally Inadequate

2 82. "An EIR shall describe feasible measures which could minimize significant adverse
impacts." CEQA Guidelines § 15126.4(a)(1). An EIR may not defer the formulation of mitigation
4 measures to a future time, but mitigation measures may specify performance standards that would

5 mitigate significant effects and may be accomplished in more than one specified way.

6 "Impermissible deferral of mitigation measures occurs when an EIR puts off analysis or orders a
7 report without either setting standards or demonstrating how the impact can be mitigated in the

8 manner described in the EIR." Preserve Wild Santee V. City of Santee, 210 Cal.App.4th 260, 280-
9 281 (2012).

10 83. The efficacy of a mitigation measure in remedying the identified environmental

11 problem must be apparent in the EIR. Sierra Club v. County of San Diego, (2014) 231 Cal.App.4th
12 1152, 1168; Communities for a Better Env't v. City of Richmond, (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 70,
13 95; Gray v. County of Madera, (2008) 167 Cal.App.4th 1099, 1116; Cleveland Nat'l Forest
14 Found. v. San Diego Ass'n of Gov'ts, (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 413, 433.
15 84. The FEIR improperly defers analysis and formulation of mitigation measures, and
16 the mitigation measures that are included in the FEIR are unenforceable or insufficient, including
17 its adopted mitigation measures for noise and pedestrian safety.

18 The FEIR Failed to Respond to All Comments

19 85. "The lead agency shall evaluate comments on environmental issues received from

20 persons who reviewed the draft EIR and shall prepare a written response." CEQA Guidelines §
21 15088.

22 86. The FEIR failed to include and address at least three comment letters that were
23 submitted during the public comment period on the Draft EIR, including: comments from Andrew
24 Tubbs, regarding Project objectives, sent September 3, 2019; comments from Robin Roemer,
25 regarding air pollution and project objectives, sent September 17, 2019; and comments from
26 Clemence Tiradon, regarding air quality, sent November 3, 2019.

27

28
17
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

87. Where a comment suggests specific mitigation, the response must address the
2 suggested mitigation measure with a reasoned analysis explaining why a it was not accepted. King
3 |l & Gardiner Farms, LLC v. County of Kern, (2020) 45 Cal.5th 814, 880. The FEIR failed to
4  substantively address a portion of the comment letter that was submitted during the public
5 comment period on the Draft EIR, sent on November 4, 2019 by Lozano Smith regarding noise

6 impacts of the project and the City's decision to employ different mitigation measures for the

7 School and the residences on Silk Wood Lane.

8 88. A specific response is required when a comment raises a specific question about a
9 significant environmental issue. 14 Cal. Code Regs §§ 15088(b), 15204(a). The FEIR failed to
10 substantively respond to a portion of a comment letter that was submitted during the public

11 comment period on the Draft EIR, sent on November 4, 2019 by Jeffrey Lawson regarding the
12 impacts of the project on Coyote Creek. The FEIR asserts that it is exempt from considering or
13 analyzing such impacts, concluding that "[t]he fact that traffic volumes will increase on the
14 existing bridge over the creek does not equate to increased impacts because the bridge was

15 constructed and evaluated under the assumption that Charcot Avenue would be extended to
16 Oakland Road." However, the Charcot bridge over Coyote Creek was built in 1971.

17 89. The FEIR failed to substantively respond to portion of a comment letter that was
18 submitted during the public comment period on the Draft EIR, sent on November 4, 2019 by
19 | Lozano Smith regarding the DEIR's failure to analyze the impact of the Project on the Orchard
20 School operations and the neighborhood between Silk Wood Lane and Rock Avenue.

21 90. The FEIR failed to substantively respond to a portion of a comment letter that was
22 submitted during the public comment period on the Draft EIR, sent on November 4, 2019 by
23  Lozano Smith regarding the safety impacts of the Project on students and pedestrians, including
24 | but not limited to the efficacy of the HAWK light, the decision not to utilize crossing guards or
25  implement other safety measures, and the increased likelihood of cars crashing through the School
26  fence from Oakland Road.

27

28
18
FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

91. For each of these reasons, the City prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to

2 proceed in the manner required by law in certifying the FEIR and approving the Project. The

3 FEIR's errors and omissions precluded informed decision making and informed public
4 I participation, thereby thwarting the statutory goals of the EIR process.

5 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as follows:

6 1. That this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate:

7 a. Commanding Respondents to set aside their certifications of the FEIR and to

8 prepare a revised EIR and otherwise comply with CEQA prior to any
9 subsequent action taken to approve the Project:
10 b. Commanding Respondents to immediately suspend all activities in furtherance
11 of the Project; and,

12 c. Commanding Respondents to set aside their approvals of the Project.

13 2. For an award of Petitioner's costs incurred in bringing this action, and reasonable
14 attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 1021.5, or as otherwise authorized by
15 law; and

16 3. For such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.
