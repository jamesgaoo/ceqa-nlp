22 Petitioner LAWRENCE HICKMAN alleges the following:

23 INTRODUCTION

24 1. Petitioner LA WRENCE HICKMAN ("Petitioner") challenges the approvals made on

25 October 13, 2020 by the City of Berkeley and City of Berkeley City Council (collectively,

26 "Respondent") for the Administrative Use Permit ("AUP") (#ZP2018-0174) for a project located at a

27 1346 Ordway Street, Berkeley, California 94702 in Alameda County (the "Project").

28 2. Petitioner alleges that the foregoing actions violated the California Environmental

LAWRENCE HICKMAN V. CITY OF BERKELBY ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Quality Act, Public Resources Code §21000 et seq. ("CEQA") and the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14,

2 California Code of Regulations, §15000 et seq., violated Respondent's Municipal Code, and violated

3 Petitioner's right to due process. Petitioner seeks a determination from this Court that Respondent's

4 approval of the Project and related actions are invalid and void, failed to satisfy the requirements of

5 CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, violated the Respondent's own laws, and violated Petitioner's right

6 to due process.

7 3. Petitioner respectfully petitions this Court for a peremptory writ a of mandate, pursuant to

8 Code of Civil Procedure §1094.5 and Public Resources Code §21168 (or in the alternative, Code of

9 Civil Procedure §1085 and Public Resources Code §$21168.5) and Public Resources Code §21168.9

10 that (1) directs the City of Berkeley and the Berkeley City Council to void the adoption of the

11 Resolution approving the AUP; (2) directs the Respondent to comply with the California
12 Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code §21000 et seq. and other state and local laws; (3)

13 prohibits the Respondent from approving any further permits or contracts furthering the Project

14 pending completion of a legally adequate environmental review and permit review hearing; and

15 (4) directs Respondent to take whatever other action is necessary to ensure that any future action related
16 to the Project, and associated environmental review of same, will be in conformance with CEQA, the

17 Berkeley Municipal Code (BMC"*), and due process requirements.

18 PARTIES

19 4. Petitioner LAWRENCE HICKMAN is an individual and a longtime resident of the City
20 of Berkeley. Petitioner's Property is located at 1333 Hopkins Street, Berkeley, California 94702

21 ("Petitioner's Property").

22 5. Respondent, CITY OF BERKELEY, is a governing body and municipal corporation

23 exercising local government power. The Respondent is the CEQA "lead agency" for the Project. As

24 lead agency for the Project, the Respondent is responsible for environmental review that describes and
25 analyzes the Project and its impacts and evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or
26 avoid any significant environmental impacts.

27 6. CITY OF BERKELEY CITY COUNCIL is the Respondent's final decision-making

28 body, which adopted a Resolution purporting to approve the Project on or about October 13, 2020.

2

LAWRENCE HICKMAN V. CITY OF BERKELEY ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F Respondent, City Council, is responsible for regulating and controlling land use within the City of

2 Berkeley.

3 7. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents identified as Does

4 1-10. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Respondents Does 1-10,

5 inclusive, are individuals, entities or agencies with material interests affected by the Project or by the

6 Respondent's actions with respect to the Project. When the true identities and capacities of these

7 Respondents have been determined, Petitioner will, with leave of Court if necessary, amend this

8 Petition to insert such identities and capacities.

9 8. Real Parties in Interest, JENNIE DURANT and KEKI BURJORJEE ("Real Parties in
10 Interest" or "RPI"), are individuals and the recipients of Respondent's relevant approvals for the

11 Project.

12 9. RPI has title, right, or interest in real property commonly identified as 1346 Ordway

13 Street, Berkeley, California 94702 (the "Subject Property"), which is the location for the subject Project
14 approvals at issue here. Petitioner's Property shares a common property boundary with the Subject
15 Property along the northern boundary of Petitioner's Property.

16 10. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest

17 identified as Does 8-20. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Respondents

18 Does 8-20, inclusive, are individuals, entities or agencies with material interests affected by the Project

19 or by the Respondent's actions with respect to the Project. When the true identities and capacities of

20 these Real Parties in Interest have been determined, Petitioner will, with leave of Court if necessary,

21 amend this Petition to insert such identities and capacities.

22 BACKGROUND FACTS

23 11. On or about April 23, 2018, Petitioner filed a complaint with Respondent's Code

24 Enforcement Unit ("Code Enforcement") concerning unpermitted trees, approximately 10 ft. to 15 ft.,

25 tall, planted in a row by RPI along and near the boundary line with Petitioner's Property.

26 12. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that at least some of the

27 aforementioned trees were planted in the side setbacks of the Subject Property, which are required to be

28 unoccupied and unobstructed under the BMC.

3

LAWRENCE HICKMAN V. CITY OF BERKELEY ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 13. On or about April 30, 2018, Petitioner called Code Enforcement to report that an

2 unpermitted arbor/trellis had been constructed against his rear garage on the property line between

3 Petitioner's Property and the Subject Property.

4 14. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that on or about May 10, 2018,

5 Code Enforcement inspected the Subject Property and issued a Notice of Violation addressed to RPI for

6 an unpermitted fence and unpermitted hedge over 6 ft. in height 6 in the side setbacks, which are required

7 to be unoccupied and unobstructed under the BMC.

8 15. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that on or about September 7,

9 2018, RPI filed an AUP application to seek approval for an existing unpermitted fence and hedge over

10 6 ft. in height along the Subject Property's property line.

11 16. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that after an initial review of the

12 application, Respondent's staff determined that in addition to permits required for the unpermitted

13 fence and hedge over 6 ft. in height, additional AUPs were required for the unpermitted existing

14 accessory building; the unpermitted existing trellis; and the unpermitted use of a front yard off-street

15 parking space on a non-conforming driveway.

16 17. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that on or about July 17, 2020,

17 Peter Chun, Associate Traffic Engineer for the City of Berkeley, recommended that RPI restore the

18 original parking space in the rear of the Subject Property or remove the non-conforming driveway and

19 use on street parking as recommended by Planning.

20 18. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that after several requests for

21 additional information and resubmission of the afore-described application, on or about December 3,

22 2019, Respondent's staff deemed RPI's AUP application complete and determined, pursuant to the

23 project specifications contemplated at that time, that the Project was categorically exempt from the

24 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") under §15301 of the CEQA Guidelines.

25 19. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that on or about February 25,

26 2020, Respondent's staff posted a Notice of Administrative Decision concerning the Zoning Officer's

27 approval of PRI's AUP application.

28 20. On or about March 17, 2020, Petitioner filed an appeal of the Zoning Officer's decision

4

LAWRENCE HICKMAN V. CITY OF BERKELEY ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 to the Zoning Adjustments Board («ZAB").

2 21. On June 11, 2020, the ZAB conducted a public hearing to consider Petitioner's appeal of

3 the Zoning Officer's decision. The ZAB approved RPI's AUP application with modified Conditions of

4 Approval and denied Petitioner's appeal.

5 22. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that on or about June 30, 2020,
6 Petitioner and RPI filed separate appeals of the ZAB decision with Respondent's City Clerk.

7 Petitioner's appeal sought to reverse the ZAB decision in its entirety based on a failure of the ZAB to a

8 afford Petitioner his due process rights and a meaningful hearing. RPI's appeal sought to overturn the

9 condition imposed on the height of her hedge imposed by the ZAB.

10 23. A hearing on the aforementioned appeals was scheduled for October 13, 2020 before the

11 City of Berkeley City Council.

12 24. On the morning of October 13, 2020, Petitioner received a telephone call from the

13 assistant to the Vice Mayor of the City of Berkeley and was advised that the Vice Mayor urgently

14 needed to speak with him. Petitioner spoke with the Vice Mayor, Sophie Hahn (City Council Member

15 representing District 5). Among other things, the Vice Mayor questioned Petitioner as to what he really
16 wanted and what he expected to get out of his appeal. The Vice Mayor further stated that she had

17 driven past the Project and did not see anything that he should be upset about.

18 25. On October 13, 2020, the Respondent City of Berkeley City Council held a public

19 hearing to consider the appeals to the ZAB's decision. Said hearing was calendared as Agenda Item 21

20 to the Agenda of the Berkeley City Council meeting scheduled for Tuesday, October 13, 2020

21 ("October 13, 2020 appeal hearing"). The October 13, 2020 appeal hearing was not heard until after

22 11:00 pm.

23 26. Shortly after Respondent's staff began its presentation on the above-described item,

24 Jesse Arreguin, Mayor of the City of Berkeley, directed staff to "hit the high notes." Petitioner and RPI

25 were each allowed five (5) minutes to present their appeals. Petitioner presented his appeal first,

26 followed by RPI JENNIE DURANT. No formal rebuttal time was to be allowed for either Petitioner or

27 RPI. However, RPI was allowed to rebut Petitioner's appeal and present a new element to the Project,
28 concerning the addition of an electric vehicle charging station at the Subject Property. In contrast,

5

LAWRENCE HICKMAN V. CITY OF BERKELEY ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

M Petitioner was not allowed to rebut RPI's presentation or provide any comment on RPI's newly

2 revealed additional Project element. Even so, Respondent considered PRI's newly revealed plan to

3 install an electric vehicle charging station at the Subject Property as part of the basis for granting an
4 accommodation and variances for the Project.

5 27. At the October 13, 2020 appeal hearing, two (2) members of the public commented on

6 the above-described item. Immediately thereafter, Mayor Arreguin closed the public comment section

7 without allowing, as noted by them, Council Members the opportunity to ask clarifying questions of the

8 parties.

9 28. Vice Mayor, Sophie Hahn, did not disclose her communication with Petitioner and did

10 not recuse herself from the October 13, 2020 appeal hearing.

11 29. During the course of the October 13, 2020 appeal hearing, the City Council voted twice
12 to suspend the rules and extend the meeting beyond the prescribed hours. The total length of the

13 Respondent City Council meeting held on October 13, 2020 was approximately 5 hours. The instant
14 hearing did not begin in earnest until 11:00 p.m. On several occasions during the October 13, 2020

15 appeal hearing, Mayor Arreguin urged Council members to keep their comments brief because they
16 were short on time.

17 30. Steve Buckley, Zoning Officer, displayed signs of fatigue and confusion when asked

18 about the impact of allowing RPI's 14 ft. trees to encroach onto Petitioner's Property. Mr. Buckley

19 assessed that there would be a mutual obligation to maintain RPI's 14ft trees that encroach onto

20 Petitioner's Property, but he and Mayor Arreguin dismissed the issue as a civil matter.

21 31. Respondent council members and staff appeared to have not reviewed the hearing

22 packet, including staff report and appeal documents and evidence, submitted to Council specifically for

23 the purpose of advance preparation for the hearing. For example, Council member Susan Wengraf

24 suggested that the parties perform a land survey of the properties to establish the location of the

25 property line and then negotiate path forward between them. However, a land survey had been

26 performed, the boundary line had been established, said land survey was part of the information

27 contained in the materials before the City Council, and the ZAB had used said established boundary as

28 the basis for denying RPI's request to install a lattice on top of the existing fence. Mayor Arreguin

6

LAWRENCE HICKMAN V. CITY OF BERKELEY ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

nodded in approval at Council member Wengraf's suggestion. Neither staff nor any Council member

2 corrected Council member Wengraf's or Mayor Arrenguin's understanding of the record before them.

3 32. On October 13, 2020, Respondent City Council, barely before midnight, voted to adopt

4 Resolution No. 69,588-N.S. thereby approving AUP #ZP2018-0174 to 1) permit an existing non-

5 conforming 128 sq. ft. accessory building in the southwest corner of the subject lot; permit an existing

6 5 ft. x 21 ft., 9-ft. tall trellis located within the south side setback (required to be unoccupied and

7 unobstructed under the BMC); approve a hedge with a height of 14-ft. tall in the north and south side

8 setbacks (required to be unoccupied and unobstructed under the BMC); 2) approve an administrative

9 use permit to permanently establish a front yard planter strip to comply with the federal Fair Housing

10 Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, under

11 the City's Reasonable Accommodation Provisions; and 3) dismiss the appeals.

12 33. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that RPI has installed an electric

13 vehicle charging station on the Subject Property.

14 34. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that Respondent has not filed and

15 posted a Notice of Exemption for the above-described approval.

16 35. This action has been brought within one-hundred-eighty (180) days of the date of the
17 public agency's decision to carry out or approve the project, as required by Public Resources Code
18 §21167(d).

19 36. On or about February 12, 2021, before the commencement of this action, Petitioner

20 served written notice of the commencement of this action on Respondent in accordance with the

21 requirements of Public Resources Code §21167.5.

22 37. On or about February 12, 2021, Petitioner notified the Attorney General of the State of

23 California of the filing of this petition and furnished him with a copy of the petition in accordance with

24 the requirements of Public Resources Code §21167.7.

25 38. The action of the Respondent in approving the Project constitute : prejudicial abuse of
26 discretion, because Respondent failed to proceed in a manner required by law, failed to make findings

27 that are supported by substantial evidence, made findings that are not supported by the evidence,

28 proceeded in excess of its jurisdiction, and failed to provide Petitioner a fair hearing.

LAWRENCE HICKMAN V. CITY OF BERKELEY ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

t 39. Respondent and/or RPI are allowing or being allowed to proceed with and maintain

2 construction and actions on the Project which has resulted in irreparable harm to the information

3 requirements of CEQA to disclose impacts and avoid or mitigate significant impacts of the Project to

4 traffic, greenhouse gases, and air quality impacts. A temporary restraining order and preliminary and

5 permanent injunctions should issue restraining Respondent and RPI from proceeding with the Project.

6 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7 40. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of

8 Civil Procedure $1094.5 and Public Resources Code §21168. In the alternative, this Court has

9 jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §1085 and Public Resources Code §21168.5.

10 41. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California in

11 and for the County of Alameda, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure $394.

12 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY 13

14 42. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant action and
15 has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

16 43. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code §21167.5 by

17 sending a written notice of this action to the Respondent. A copy of this written notice and proof of

18 service are attached as Exhibit 1 to this Petition for Writ of Mandate.

19 44. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code §21167.6 by concurrently filing an

20 election to prepare the record of administrative proceedings relating to this action.

21 45. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless

22 this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondent to set aside its approval of the
23 Project. In the absence of such remedy, Respondent's approvals will remain in effect in violation of
24 state law.

25 STANDING

26 46. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims in this Petition because Petitioner's

27 economic, governmental, aesthetic and environmental interests are directly and adversely affected by

28 the Respondent's approval of the Project. Moreover, Petitioner's property interest in Petitioner's

8

LAWRENCE HICKMAN V. CITY OF BERKELBY ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

t Property is affected by Respondent's approval of the Project.

2 ARGUMENT

3 47. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference all of the above Paragraphs, inclusive,

4 of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.

5 48. As detailed below, Respondent committed prejudicial abuses of discretion because: a.)

6 Respondent have failed to proceed in the manner required by law; b.) Respondent's approval of the

7 Project, and related actions taken October 13, 2020, are not supported by the findings; and/or c.) the

8 findings made are not supported by the evidence.

9 I. VIOLATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT

10 Respondent's Claimed CEQA Exemptions Do Not Apply to this Project

11 49. Petitioner incorporates by reference all other paragraphs in this Petition as though they

12 were set forth in full herein.

13 50. Respondent failed to proceed in the manner required by law and abused its discretion

14 because Respondent's CEQA analysis for the Project did not include the electric vehicle charging

15 station, which was made a part of the Project on or about October 13, 2020, approximately 10 months

16 after Respondent's CEQA determination. There is no evidence in the administrative record that the

17 afore-described-electric vehicle charging station received any consideration under CEQA, despite the

18 fact that said charging station was considered as a factor in granting certain approvals for the Project. In

19 addition, said charging station was not part of the project description. As such, the project description

20 was flawed and Respondent's CEQA analysis is insufficient.

21 51. Respondent failed to proceed in the manner required by law and abused its discretion

22 because Respondent made determinations that are not supported or supportable by the California

23 Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code §21000 et seq. ("CEQA") with respect to its

24 findings of exemptions.

25 52. Respondent determined that the Project was subject to, but exempt from CEQA.

26 However, the Project is not appropriate for any of the claimed categorical exemptions.

27 53. Respondent's findings are not supported by substantial evidence in determining that the

28 exemptions are not applicable in this case because potentially significant impacts and impacts are not

9

AWRENCE HICKMAN V. CITY OF BERKELEY ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

mitigated and the Project expands the existing use on the Subject Property.

2 B. Respondent Committed a Prejudicial Abuse of Discretion by Failing to Make Findings

3 Supported by the Evidence

4 54. Petitioner incorporates by reference all other paragraphs in this Petition as though they

5 were set forth in full herein.

6 55. Respondent's actions in approving the Project constitute an abuse of discretion in

7 addressing the above-described subjects, are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, and

8 fail to comply with CEQA and CEQA Guidelines. Specifically, Respondent's actions are invalid

9 because Respondent failed to make proper written findings as required by CEQA, including, but not
10 limited to, the following:

11 a. The findings are conclusory, internally inconsistent, and fail to bridge the analytic gap
12 between the raw evidence and the findings.

13 b. Respondent's determination that the Project is exempt from CEQA is not supported by
14 substantial evidence as the Project does not involve an existing facility for which there will be
15 negligible or no expansion of use.
16 C. Respondent's findings related to the claim that CEQA exemptions apply and that there
17 are no exceptions to the CEQA exemptions are not supported by substantial evidence as the cumulative
18 impacts of successive projects of the same type, in the same place, is significant and there is a

19 reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect due to unusual circumstances in that
20 RPI seeks approval of a project which includes structures that encroach onto Petitioner's Property and
21 impose a maintenance obligation on Petitioner.
22 56. In each of the respects enumerated above, Respondent has violated its duties under
23 CEQA, abused their discretion, failed to proceed in a manner required by law, and have decided the
24 matters complained of without the support of substantial evidence. Accordingly, the approval of the
25 Project must be set aside.

26 57. Respondent's failure to comply with the requirements of CEQA renders the

27 environmental review inadequate as a matter of law and requires that Respondent's approval of the
28 Project must be set aside.

10

LAWRENCE HICKMAN V. CITY OF BERKELEY ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 58. Unless Petitioner is granted injunctive relief, he will suffer irreparable harm in that the
2 implementation of the Project will cause permanent harm to Petitioner and will create adverse

3 environmental impacts previously described in this Petition, to the detriment of Petitioner and others

4 similarly situated.

5 59. Petitioner lacks an adequate remedy at law because monetary damages cannot be

6 ascertained and Petitioner and its members cannot be compensated for the environmental degradation

7 caused by this Project.

8 II. VIOLATIONS OF BERKELEY MUNICIPAL CODE

9 A. The Respondent Committed a Preiudicial Abuse of Discretion Because Its Findings Are

10 Not Supported by the Evidence and by Not Following the Law

11 60. Petitioner incorporates by reference all other paragraphs in this Petition as though they
12 were set forth in full herein.

13 1. The Evidence Does Not Support the Findings Required for Respondent to Approve the
14 Administrative Use Permit

15 61. According to BMC §23B.28.050A, an AUP may issue, either as submitted or modified,

16 "…only upon finding that the establishment, maintenance or operation of the use, or the

17 construction of a building, structure or addition thereto, under the circumstances of the
particular case existing at the time at which the application is granted, will not be detrimental to
18 the health, safety, peace, morals, comfort or general welfare of persons residing or working in the area or neighborhood of such proposed use or be detrimental or injurious to property and
19 improvements of the adjacent properties, the surrounding area or neighborhood or to the general

20 welfare of the City."

21 62. Respondent City Council committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion when it made the

22 findings under BMC $23B.28.050A that:

23 "the Project, under the circumstances of this particular case existing at the time at which the

24 application is granted, would not be detrimental to the health, safety, peace, morals, comfort, and general welfare of the persons residing or working in the neighborhood of such proposed
25 use or be detrimental or injurious to property and improvements of the adjacent properties, the surrounding area or neighborhood, or to the general welfare of the City...'
26

27 because the evidence does not support such finding.

28

11

NCE HICKMAN V. CITY OF BERKELEY ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

63. There is evidence in the record that elements of the Project are detrimental or injurious

2 to the property and improvements of Petitioner's Property. Specifically, RPI's row of trees, along or

3 near the common property line, are not only encroaching onto Petitioner's Property by approximately 4

4 inches but are also pushing down on his existing fence. The height of said trees cause an oppressive

5 feeling of enclosure. Moreover, the Zoning Officer, Steve Buckley, assessed that there would be a

6 mutual obligation to maintain RPI's row of trees that encroach onto Petitioner's Property.

7 64. RPI's trellis is located three (3) inches from Petitioner's rear garage which interferes

8 with Petitioner's maintenance of said structure. In addition, RPI is growing vines over the top of the
9 trellis and said vines are already growing onto the roof of Petitioner's rear garage and over the top of
10 the fence between the properties. Furthermore, there are light and air impacts associated with RPI's

11 approximate 10ft. to 15 ft. tall row of trees and 9 ft. 9 tall trellis.

12 65. RPI's ADU, which violates the height and setback restrictions set under the BMC, has

13 an impact on the light, air, noise, and value of the neighboring properties.

14 66. With regard to allowing an off-street parking space in violation of required setbacks,

15 there are health and safety impacts including, diminished visibility of oncoming pedestrians due to a 6
16 ft. high fence along the southern border of the Subject Property and a reduced reaction time to avoid
17 encounters with pedestrians when exiting the Subject Property. Neither of those hazards would be

18 present with on-street parking.

19 67. Moreover, RPI's Plat of Survey, submitted with her AUP application, shows that a
20 portion of RPI's driveway, and other elements of the Project, encroach onto Petitioner's Property.

21 68. RPI JENNIE DURANT, during the October 13, 2020, suddenly, and for the first time,

22 announced that she had an electric vehicle and had applied for the installation of a charging station on

23 the Subject Property. Respondent did not analyze the impact of said late addition to the overall Project
24 and its effect on neighboring properties. Nevertheless, Respondent considered RPI's proposed charging

25 station as a basis for a granting certain approvals.

26 2. Respondent Granted a Reasonable Accommodation without Considering the Extent to

27 Which the Requested Modification Might be in Conflict with Legitimate Purposes of its
Existing Zoning or Subdivision Regulations
28 69. Pursuant to BMC §23B.52.010:

12

LAWRENCE HICKMAN V. CITY OF BERKELEY ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

H N m0 + "It is the policy of the City to comply with the Federal Fair Housing Act, the Americans with Disabilities Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act to provide reasonable accommodation by modifying the application of its zoning and subdivision regulations for persons with disabilities seeking fair access to housing. The City also recognizes the importance of sustaining and enhancing neighborhoods. In determining whether a requested modification of zoning or subdivision regulations is reasonable, the City will consider, among other relevant

5 factors, the extent to which the requested modification might be in conflict with the legitimate

6 purposes of its existing zoning or subdivision regulations. The purpose of this chapter is to establish a process for making and acting upon requests for reasonable accommodation.»
7 (Underlining Added.)

8 70. Respondent's approval of a "reasonable accommodation" concerning RPI's off-street
9 parking space affected BMC§ 23D.12.080.B, in order to allow a new off-street parking space to be
10 created within the required front yard setback (allowing a setback of 1ft. 4 in. where a 20 ft. setback is
11 required by code), and BMC § 23D.12.080.E, in order to allow elimination of the required landscaping
12 strip between adjacent rear or interior side lot lines (allowing a setback of 8 in. where a 2 ft. setback is
13 required by code).
14 71. Respondent's findings concerning the afore-described accommodation summarily focus
15 merely on providing a reasonable accommodation for fair housing access. The extent to which the
16 requested modification might be in conflict with the legitimate purposes of Respondent's existing
17 zoning or subdivision regulations was not considered or discussed.
18 72. In addition, Respondent failed to consider alternative action that could be taken that did
19 not require the granting of reasonable accommodation. Such action included the option to reestablish
20 the rear parking on the Subject Property, as recommended by Peter Chun, Associate Traffic Engineer
21 for the City of Berkeley.
22 73. Morcover, while Respondent considered RPI's plan to add an electric vehicle charging
23 station on the Subject Property, Respondent failed to consider the impact of said plan on the overall
24 impacts of the Project or the "reasonable accommodation" sought.
25 3. Respondent Granted Variances Without Make the Required Findings
26 74. Pursuant to BMC §23B.44.030.A a variance application may be approved only if all of
27 the following findings are made:
28

13

LAWRENCE HICKMAN V. CITY OF BERKELEY ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

L "1. There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applying to the land,

2 building or use referred to in the application, which circumstances or conditions do not apply generally to land, buildings and/or uses in the same District;

3 2. The granting of the application is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial

4 property rights of the subject property's owner;
3. The establishment, maintenance or operation of the use or the construction of a building,

5 structure or addition thereof, to be approved will not, under the circumstances of the particular

6 case, materially affect adversely the health or safety of persons residing or working in the

7 neighborhood of the property of the applicant and will not, under the circumstances of the particular case, be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property or

8 improvements in said neighborhood; and that the granting of the Variance will promote the

9 municipal health, welfare and safety and benefit the City as a whole;

10 4.Any other variance findings required by the Section of the Ordinance applicable to that
particular Variance.»

11 75.
12 Respondent granted a Variance for the requirements of BMCÇ 23D.12.080.B, in order to

13 allow a new off-street parking space to be created within the required front yard setback (allowing a

14 setback of 1ft. 4 in. where a 20 ft. setback is required by code), and BMC § 23D.12.080.E, in order to

15 allow elimination of the required landscaping strip between adjacent rear or interior side lot lines

16 (allowing a setback of 8 in. is where a 2 ft. setback is required by code) without making any of the above-
described prerequisite findings.
17 76.

18 Moreover, Respondent failed to consider alternative action that could be taken that did

19 not require the granting of a variance. Such action included the option to reestablish the rear parking on

20 the Subject Property, as recommended by Peter Chun, Associate Traffic Engineer for the City of
Berkeley.
21

22 4. Respondent's Approved a Use Permit for an ADU Containing Unlawful Elements without
Granting a Variance for the Unlawful Elements

23 77.
24 Pursuant to BMC §23D.08.005.A1. "[n]o Accessory Building may be constructed unless

25 authorized by an AUP..." Pursuant to BMC §23D.08.020.A. "[n]o accessory building or enclosed

26 accessory structure may exceed ten feet in average height when any portion of the building or structure

27 is within four feet of a lot line." Pursuant to BMC §23D.08.020.B. "[n]o accessory building or enclosed

28 accessory structure may exceed 12 feet in average height when any portion of the building or structure
is between four and ten feet of a lot line.'

14

LAWRENCE HICKMAN V. CITY OF BERKELEY ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 78. The maximum height of RPI's ADU is purported to be 12 ft. 2 in. In addition, said ADU

2 is located approximately 8ft. 6 in. from the side property line to the north; about 56 ft. from the front

3 property line to the east; 3 ft. 7 in. to 3 ft. 9 in. from the side property line to the south; and 4 ft. in. to

4 4 ft. 3 in. from the rear property line to the west. As such, said ADU does not meet the restrictions of

5 BMC§§ 23D.08.020.A-B.

6 79. Pursuant to BMC § 23B.44.010 variances may be granted to:

7 "…vary or modify the strict application of any of the regulations or provisions of this

8 Ordinance with reference to the use of property, the height of buildings, the yard setbacks of buildings, the percentage of lot coverage, the lot area requirements, or the parking space
9 requirements of this Ordinance…."

10 80. Moreover, pursuant to BMC §23B.44.030.A, set-out in full above, specific findings are

11 required in order to approve a variance.

12 81. With regard to the ADU at issue, RPI did not seek and Respondent did not grant any

13 variances in connection with same. Accordingly, Respondent's AUP approval is insufficient for RPI's
14 ADU. Respondent abused its discretion and exceeded its authority under the BMC in granting an AUP

15 for RPI's ADU without variances.

16 IIL. PROCEDURAL AND DUE PROCESS VIOLATIONS

17 A. Respondent Committed Prejudicial Procedural Errors in Violation of Petitioner's Right to

18 Due Process

19 82. Petitioner incorporates by reference all of the paragraphs in this Petition as though they
20 were set forth in full herein.

21 83. The Fourteenth Amendment and the California Constitution prohibit the government

22 from depriving any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law. (U.S. Const., amend.

23 XIV, §1; Cal. Const., art. I, §7.) Every administrative agency must use certain procedures to protect the
24 interests of the parties involved in the administrative proceeding. (See Goldberg v. Kelly (1970) 397

25 U.S. 254, 255 (state and local agency procedures must satisfy Fourteenth Amendment due process
26 requirements).) The California Supreme Court holds that, for any statutorily created benefit (in this
27 issuance of a permit), even if the interest being terminated does not itself rise to the level of a case, the
28 protected property or liberty interest, the individual has an independent liberty interest in being free

15

LAWRENCE HICKMAN V. CITY OF BERKELEY ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 from arbitrary adjudicative action. (People v. Ramirez (1979) 25 Cal.3d 260, 267-268.)

2 84. As detailed below, Respondent engaged in series of prejudicial procedural errors which

3 had the effect of depriving Petitioner of a fair hearing.

4 1. Respondent City Council Improperly Started the October 13, 2020 Appeal Hearing after
5 10:00 p.m.

6 85. City of Berkeley Council Rules of Procedure and Order, adopted June 16, 2020,
7 ("BCRP") §ILD states, in relevant part, that:
8 "Except at meetings at which the budget is to be adopted, no public hearing may commence
9

10 later than 10:00 p.m. unless there is legal necessity to hold the hearing or make a decision at that meeting or the City Council determines by a two-thirds vote that there is a fiscal necessity
11 to hold the hearing."

12

13 86. The October 13, 2020 appeal hearing commenced after 11:00 p.m. There was no legal

14 necessity to hold the hearing on that date or make a decision at that meeting and there was no fiscal

15 necessity to hold said hearing.

16 2. Respondent City Council Improperly Continued the October 13, 2020 Appeal Hearing Past 11:00 p.m. and then Conducted Hurried Deliberations
17

18 87. BCRP §II.E. states, in relevant part, that:

19 "No Council meeting shall continue past 11:00 p.m. unless a two-thirds majority of the Council
votes to extend the meeting to discuss specified items; and any motion to extend the meeting
20 beyond 11:00 p.m. shall include a list of specific agenda items to be covered and shall specify in

21 which order these items shall be handled."

22 88. During the course of the October 13, 2020 appeal hearing, Respondent City Council

23 voted twice to extend the meeting beyond 11:00 p.m., however, neither motion included a list of a

24 specific agenda items to be covered nor did they specify which order any remaining items were to be

25 handled.

26 89. The total length of the afore-described meeting was approximately 5 hours.

27 90. At the start of the October 13, 2020 appeal hearing, Mayor Arreguin instructed staff to

28 "hit the high notes".

16
LAWRENCE HICKMAN V. CITY OF BERKELEY ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-4 91.

2 On several occasions, Mayor Arreguin urged Council members to keep their comments,
during deliberations, brief because they were short on time.

3

4

5 3. Respondent City Council Failed to Provide Adequate Time for Discussion of the Issues

92. BCRP §IV.E., in relevant part, allows for:

6

7 "five-minute presentations each by the appellant and applicant. Where the appellant is not the applicant, the appellants of a single appeal collectively shall have five minutes to comment and

8 the applicant shall have five minutes to comment. If there are multiple appeals filed, each appellant or group of appellants shall have five minutes to comment. Where the appellant is the

9 applicant, the applicant/appellant shall have five minutes to comment and the persons

10 supporting the action of the board or commission on appeal shall have five minutes to
comment..."

11 93.

12 During the October 13, 2020 appeal hearing, Petitioner and RPI JENNIE DURANT
were each given 5 minutes to speak. Both Petitioner and RPI JENNIE DURANT submitted
13 applications to appeal to the decision of the ZA.B, however, only RPI JENNIE DURANT was granted the
14 opportunity to address her appeal while also rebutting Petitioner's appeal. Notably, as part of her
15 presentation, RPI provided new details concerning the Project. Specifically, the planned addition of an

16 electric vehicle charging station on the Subject Property.

17 94.

18 Immediately following the last public comment, Mayor Arreguin closed the public

19 comment section, thereby preventing City Council Members from asking clarifying questions from
Petitioner and RPI.

20 95.

21 On several occasions, Mayor Arreguin urged City Council members, during

22 deliberations, to keep their comments brief because they were short on time.

96.

23 The October 13, 2020 appeal hearing was concluded shortly before midnight.

24 4. Zoning Officer, Steve Buckley, Displayed Signs of Fatigue and Confusion and was Unable
to Provide Meaningful Advice to the City Council

25 97.

26 At the October 13, 2020 appeal hearing Steve Buckley, Zoning Officer, displayed signs

27 of fatigue and confusion when asked about the impact of allowing RPI's 14 ft. trees to encroach onto

28 Petitioner's Property. Mr. Buckley's strained explanation identified an issue with allowing PRI's trees
to encroach onto Petitioners property; however, Mr. Buckley and Respondent City Council failed to

17

LAWRENCE HICKMAN V. CITY OF BERKELEY ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

+ recognize the impact of that issue on the findings required for the issuance of the AUP. Said issue being

2 the imposition of a maintenance obligation upon Petitioner.

3 98. Respondent's inability to recognize the impact of said issue on the AUP or Petitioner's

4 rights deprived him due process.

5 5. Respondent Did Not Review the Hearing Report and Appeal Packet Prepared for Council Member Advance Consideration n Order to Make an Informed Decision as Required by 6 Law
7

8 99. Council member Susan Wengraf suggested that the parties perform a land survey of the

9 properties to establish the location of the property line and then negotiate a path forward between them.

10 Mayor Arreguin nodded in approval at Council member Wengraf's suggestion.

11 100. Even though it was included in the agenda packet prepared and submitted to them in

12 advance for the purpose of their consideration, Neither Mayor Arreguin nor Council member Wengraf

13 demonstrated any knowledge or understanding concerning the facts that: a land survey had been

14 performed and incorporated into RPI's AUP Application, the boundary line had been established, and

15 the ZAB had used said established boundary as the basis for denying RPI's request to install a lattice on

16 top of the existing fence on Petitioner's Property.

17 101. Moreover, neither staff nor the other Council Members demonstrated any knowledge of

18 the above-described facts, as no one corrected Council member Wengref's or Mayor Arreguin's

19 understanding of the facts.

102. 20 As a result of Respondent's failure to review the materials for the October 13, 2020

21 appeal hearing in order to make an informed decision, Petitioner has been deprived of his right to due

22 process.

23 6. Respondent Showed Prejudicial Preference to RPI by Not Requiring Findings Consistent
with the BMC in order to Issue the AUP in Excess of its Authority
24

25 103. Respondent granted RPI an AUP based on findings not supported by the evidence.

26 104. Respondent granted variances related to RPI's off-street parking space and the setbacks

27 required therefor without the prerequisite findings to support such variances. Instead, Respondent

28 granted said a variances as a "reasonable accommodation".

18

LAWRENCE HICKMAN V. CITY OF BERKELEY ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 105. Respondent granted a "reasonable accommodation" related to RPI's off-street parking

2 space and the setbacks required therefor without the prerequisite findings to support such

3 I accommodation.

4 106. Respondent granted an AUP for an existing nonconforming ADU, which was built

5 without a permit and in violation of the setback requirements under the BMC. Said AUP was approved

6 without the granting of variances for said setback requirements, as more fully described above.

7 7. Respondent Prejudged the Merits of Petitioner's Appeal

8 107. On the morning of October 13, 2020, Petitioner received a communication from and

9 spoke with the Vice Mayor, Sophie Hahn. Among other things, the Vice Mayor asked what Petitioner
10 really wanted and what he expects to get out of his appeal. The Vice Mayor further stated that she had

11 driven past the Subject Property and did not see anything that he should be upset about.

12 108. The Vice Mayor effectively communicated that she had pre-judged the merits of

13 Petitioner's appeal and believed that he had an ulterior motive for his appeal.
14 109. The Vice Mayor did not recuse herself from the October 13, 2020 appeal hearing and

15 took part in the vote concerning said matter.
16 8. Respondent Improperly Ascertained Information and Relied on Information Outside the
Record
17

18 110. The Brown Act intends that deliberation, as well as action, occur openly and publicly.
19 (Sacramento Newspaper Guild v. Sacramento County Board of Supervisors (1968) 263 Cal.App.2d 41,
20 47.) Both deliberation and action are deemed essential elements of the collective decision-making

21 process. "Deliberation" is the process of examining, weighing, and reflecting on the reasons for or

22 against a choice, and includes a public agency's ascertainment of facts preliminary to an ultimate
23 decision. (Sacramento Newspaper Guild v. Sacramento County Board of Supervisors (1968) 263
24 Cal.App.2d 41, 47-48.) While action and deliberation can occur separately, both must be taken in
25 public view.
26 111. On the morning of October 13, 2020, Petitioner received a communication from and
27 spoke with the Vice Mayor, Sophie Hahn. Among other things, the Vice Mayor asked what Petitioner

28 really wanted and what he expects to get out of his appeal. The Vice Mayor further stated that she had

19

LAWRENCE HICKMAN V. CITY OF BERKELEY ET AL. VERIFIBD PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

driven past the Subject Property and did not see anything that Petitioner should be upset about.

2 112. This "private" ascertainment of information violated the Brown Act and prejudiced

3 Petitioner from properly responding to the issues raised.

4 113. The Vice Mayor did not recuse herself from the October 13, 2020 appeal hearing and

5 took part in the vote concerning said matter.

6 9. Respondent Did Not Disclose Ex Parte Communications and the Substance thereof

7 114. BMC 2.06.110 requires that:

8 "Whenever a Legislative Body holds a public hearing on a zoning, landmarks, subdivision or

9 other adjudicative matter, following any staff presentation, each member of the Legislative Body shall verbally disclose all ex parte contacts concerning the subject of the hearing.
10 Members shall also submit a report of such contacts in writing prior to the commencement of
the hearing. Such reports shall include a brief statement describing the name, date, place, and
11 content of the contact. Written reports shall be available for public review in the office of the

12 secretary to the Legislative Body prior to the Meeting and placed in a file available for public
viewing at the Meeting."
13

14 115. Vice Mayor, Sophie Hahn, failed to disclose her communication with Petitioner on the

15 morning of the October 13, 2020 appeal hearing, as well as the substance of same.

16 116. The Vice Mayor did not recuse herself from the October 13, 2020 appeal hearing and

17 took part in the vote concerning said matter.

18 117. The aforementioned ex parte communication and the failure to disclose the substance of

19 same violates the open government provisions of the BMC and the Brown Act (Gov. Code, §54950 et

20 seq.).

21 118. As described above, Respondent has violated its duties under the law, abused its

22 discretion, failed to proceed in a manner required by law, decided the matters complained of without

23 the support of substantial evidence, and committed prejudicial procedural errors. Accordingly, the

24 approval of the Project must be set aside.

25 REQUEST FOR RELIEF

26 WHEREFORE, Petitioner requests judgment in its favor as follows:

27 1. That this Court enter judgment determining or declaring that the approval of the Project

28 by Respondent was illegal and, therefore, is null and void;

20
LAWRENCE HICKMAN V. CITY OF BERKELEY ET AL. VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F 2. That this Court issues a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the Respondent to:

2 (a) vacate and set aside its October 13, 2020 approval of the Project and related

3 actions on the ground that they violate the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources

4 Code §21000 et seq., the Berkeley Municipal Code, and due process protections;

5 (b) prepare, circulate and consider a new legally adequate environmental review for

6 the Project or decide to abandon or redraft the Project;

7 (c) suspend all activity that could result in any change or alteration to the physical
8  environment until Respondent has taken such actions as may be necessary to bring its determination,

9 findings or decision regarding the Project into compliance with CEQA;

10 3. That this Court enter a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction (1)

11 restraining Respondent from granting any permits for or executing any agreements relating to the

12 Project, or otherwise approving any development, demolition, construction, or other activities or
13 undertaking pursuant to or in furtherance of the Project, pending the Court's judgment on the matters

14 raised herein; and (2) restraining Real Parties in Interest from commencing or undertaking any
15 development, demolition, construction, or other activities or undertaking pursuant to or in furtherance

16 of the Project, pending the Court's judgment on the matters raised herein;

17 4. For Petitioner costs associated with this action;

18 5. For an award of reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

19 § 1021.5; and

20 6. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.
