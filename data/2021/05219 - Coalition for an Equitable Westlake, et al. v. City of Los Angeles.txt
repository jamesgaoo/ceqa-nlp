VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- Petitioner, Coalition for An Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park, alleges:

2 Introduction
3
4 1. By this action, Petitioner, Coalition for An Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park

5 challenges the unlawful actions of the City of Los Angeles, its Planning

6 Department, and its City Council, (collectively, the City) to approve the

7 development of, and to adopt a California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA")

8 Categorical Exemption for a project (the Project) proposed to be constructed at

9 1517-1523 West gth Street in the City of Los Angeles (Project Site).

10 2. The City abused its discretion in approving the Project and related environmental
11 documentation, as described below.
12 0520202&5 Parties

3. Petitioner Coalition for an Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park (the Coalition) is
an unincorporated association whose members include individuals residing and
working in the vicinity of the Project. The Coalition brings this action on behalf
of the public. Members of the Coalition have a beneficial interest in this case
because the actions being taken by the City, and challenged in this case, affect
them directly as neighbors of the Project and members of the public at large. The
Coalition is aggrieved by the Project for the reasons set forth below in this
petition.
22
23 4. Respondent City of Los Angeles (City) is a charter city and municipal

24 corporation and is responsible for regulating and controlling land use in the

25 City's territory, including but not limited to implementing and complying with

26 the provisions of CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, other California laws, and its

27 General Plan. The Los Angeles City Council (City Council) is the City's

28 legislative body. The Los Angeles Planning Department (Planning Department)

29 is a unit of City government having jurisdiction over certain land-use approvals

30 within the City. Respondent City is the lead agency for purposes of Public

31 Resources Code § 21067, with principal responsibility for conducting

32 environmental review for and approving the Project.

33 5. Real Parties in Interest, Shahin Simon Neman, Apartments on 8th I, LLC,
34 Apartments on 8th II, LLC, Apartments on 8th III, LLC, are, on information and
35

- belief, the legal and equitable owners of the Project Site and the Applicant for the

2 entitlements being challenged in this case (Applicant).

3 6. Petitioner is currently unaware of the true names and capacities of respondents 4 and defendants Does 1 through 10, and therefore sues those parties by such
5 fictitious names. Does through 10 are agents of the Respondent and Real Party
6 in Interest who are responsible in some manner for the conduct described in this
7 petition, or other persons or entities who claim some legal or equitable interest in
8 the subject matter of this action. Petitioners will amend this petition to show the
9 true names and capacities of Does 1 through 10 when such names and capacities 10 become known.
11
12 Jurisdiction and Venue
7. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this petition under Code of
14 : 2920983 Civil Procedure (CCP) §§1085 and 1094.5, Pub. Res. Code §§ 21167, 21168,
and 21168.5.

8. This case is properly classified as an unlimited civil case, and therefore within
the jurisdiction of this Court, because it is not one of the types of cases listed as
limited civil cases in CCP §§ 86, 86.1 or 87.
9. Venue is proper in this Court under CCP con 394 because the Respondent City of
Los Angeles is a local agency with territory wholly within Los Angeles County,
22 which is where the Project's environmental effects will be felt.
23
24 10. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to filing this action,

25 including exhaustion of all administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

26 Petitioner and/or other agencies and individuals raised each of the legal

27 deficiencies asserted in this petition orally or in writing during the Respondent's

28 decision-making process.

29 11. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
30 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondent to
31 set aside its certification of the Project and environmental documents. In the
32 absence of such remedies, Respondent's decisions will remain in effect in
33 violation of the state law and injurious to Petitioner.

yards, in accordance with the RAS3 Zone; for the properties located at 1517-
1523 West 8th Street.

22
23 13. The Applicant applied for Project entitlements on December 30, 2019.

24
25 14. The project was determined to qualify for the City's Transient Oriented

26 Communities (TOC) program. Pursuant to this qualification, the Project received

3 15. On December 15, 2020, Petitioner appealed the Director's Determination that the
Project qualified for a CEQA Categorical Exemption.

4

5 16. On June 1, 2021, the Planning and Land Use (PLUM) Committee considered a

6 report from the Planning Department and Petitioner's CEQA appeal for the

7 Project. After an opportunity for public comment, and presentation from the

8 Appellant's Representative, the Committee recommended to deny Petitioner's

9 appeal and sustain the Director of Planning's determination in approving the

10 Categorical Exemption as the environmental clearance for the project.

11 17. On June 15, 2021, the Los Angeles City Council voted to adopt the

12 187∞55085 recommendations of the PLUM Committee and determined that the Project was
exempt from CEQA.

18. A Notice of Exemption was filed and posted with the Los Angeles County
Registrar on June 18, 2021.

First Cause of Action
Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
19. Coalition for an Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park incorporates 11 1-20 as
though set forth herein.

21
22 20. In approving the Categorical Exemption for the Project, the City violated the

23 California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code §§ 21000-21189.3

24 (CEQA) and the CEQA Guidelines (14 Cal. Code Regs. § § 15000-15387 plus

25 appendices) in significant ways, which are described in the following paragraphs.

26
27 21. On May 19, 2021, the City approved a class-32, "infill development project"

28 categorical exemption, under CEQA Guidelines § 15332(a), is that the Project be

29 "consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable

30 general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and
regulations."

31
32 22. CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2(b) contains exceptions that apply to the Project and

33 therefore prohibit the use of a categorical exemption in this case. The Project

34 does not meet the applicable requirements due to the reasons stated below.

35

- 4 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-
2 a. There is substantial evidence in the record of cumulative impacts. There

3 are numerous other approved housing projects in the vicinity of the

4 Project, which contribute towards significant air quality, traffic, and noise

5 impacts. The Project's contribution to these impacts is cumulatively

6 considerable. CEQA Guidelines section 15355 states: "Cumulative

7 impacts refer to two or more individual effects which, when considered

∞o together, are considerable or which compound or increase other
environmental impacts."
9
10 b. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a

11 reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the

90220202851 environment due to unusual circumstances - the unusual circumstances
being the influx in projects approved and proposed for the area in such a
short time span, many of them TOC projects approved and proposed
without proper environmental analysis

Prayer for Relief
WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as follows:
1. for a peremptory Writ of Mandate:
a. directing the City to set aside and vacate its approval of the Categorical

22 Exemption for the Project;

23 b. directing the City to set aside and vacate all approvals for the Project; and

24 C.

25 ordering the City and the Applicant to cease any and all activity related to

26 the Project that may result in a physical change to the environment unless

27 and until the Project is modified so that it is consistent with the applicable

28 plan and zoning ordinances, and is re-approved following the adoption of
a legally sufficient CEQA document for the Project.

29
30 2. For costs of suit;

31 3.

32 For attorney's fees as authorized by Code of Civil Procedure §1021.5 and other
provisions of law; and

33
34 4. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
