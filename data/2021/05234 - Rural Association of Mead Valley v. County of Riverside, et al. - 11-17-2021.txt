VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Petitioner, RURAL ASSOCIATION OF MEAD VALLEY (**Petitioner" or "RAMV"),
2 alleges through this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate (*Petition"), as follows:
3 INTRODUCTION

4 1. Petitioner challenges the adoption by Respondent County of Riverside ("County"

5 or "Respondent") of a Mitigated Negative Declaration and related discretionary approvals
6 (together, the "Project Approvals") for the Harvill and Rider Warehouse Project (*Project"). As
7 noted below, the County failed to follow the required procedures required by the California
8 Environmental Quality Act (*CEQA") when it adopted the Mitigated Negative Declaration for

9 the Project. The failure to follow these procedures was prejudicial in that it precluded informed
10 decision-making. Moreover, implementation of the Project will have substantial adverse impacts
- on the environment. 8 d11 'dnoJo ME7 jeuueug 90211 Byns "PAIS EJIySIM €8€8 12 2. The Project involves the construction and operation of one (1) approximately

'SIIIH ÄueAg 14 7,850 SF of office mezzanine, 316,082 SF of warehouse, 41 dock doors, parking for automobiles
trucks, one (1) water quality detention basin, and associated improvements. 15 and
16 3. The County of Riverside's approval of the Project and Mitigated Negative
17 Declaration for the Project must be vacated because the MND fails to comply with CEQA in a
18 number of important ways, including that the County failed to adopt all feasible mitigation and
19 alternatives for significant impacts. The decision to approve the Project without imposing all
20 feasible mitigation and alternatives is contrary to CEQA's "substantive mandate" that the lead
21 agency shall not approve a project with significant impacts where feasible mitigation or
22| alternatives exist to reduce the impacts. Moreover, the Mitigated Negative Declaration is
23| deficient in numerous ways and fails to adequately address and mitigate the significant
24 environmental impacts of the Project.
25 4. During the administrative review process, numerous interested parties notified the
26 County that there was need for further analysis and mitigation due to the Project's adverse

effects. In spite of these reasoned comments in the record, the County approved the Project and
2 MND.

5. Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the
Project Approvals considered by Respondent, including rescinding any authorizations to proceed
with construction. The Riverside County Board of Supervisors certified Mitigated Negative
Declaration for the Project on October 5, 2021. The Riverside County Board of Supervisors also
approved a Plot Plan and Change of Zone. Petitioner requests that the Court vacate the Project
8 Approvals because Respondent failed to comply with the provisions set forth under the
9 California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA"),
10 and therefore failed to proceed in a manner required by law.

to adequately evaluate the 17 harmed by the County's actions in approving the Project. Petitioner was harmed by, among
18 other things, the failure of the County in its certification of the MND
19| potential impacts of the Project, and the County's approval of the Project without conducting an
20 Environmental Impact Report and without providing adequate and effective mitigation measures
21

8. The maintenance of this action is for the purpose of enforcing important public contrary to the requirements of State law.
22

23 policies of the State of California with respect to the protection of the environment under CEQA
24 and conformance with state law and local law. The maintenance and prosecution of this action
25 will confer a substantial benefit upon the public by protecting the public from environmental and
26 other harms alleged in this Petition. Petitioner is acting as a private attorney general to enforce

1 CEOA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REOUIREMENTS

2 32. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public

3 agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental
4 implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the
decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
6 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires 5

7 governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects
8 of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
9 otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with
10 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
1 33. CEQA is California's broadest environmental law and helps to guide public 8 d77 Channel Law Group, L1Z06 1R06 VPNIS UB LI S IAA S CO SIl!H ALeAeg 12 agencies such as the County during issuance of permits and approval of projects. Courts have
13 interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest protection of the environment within the reasonable scope
14 of the statutes. CEQA applies to all discretionary projects proposed to be conducted or approved
15 by a County, including private projects requiring discretionary government approval. See
16 California Public Resources Code, sections 21000 - 21178, and Title 14 Cal. Code Regs., section
17 753, and Chapter 3, sections 15000 - 15387.
18 34. CEQA requires a lead agency to consult with "all responsible and trustee
19 agencies" prior "to determining whether a negative declaration or environmental impact report is
20 required for a project." Pub. Res.Code § 21080.3(a). The CEQA Guidelines require the lead
21 agency to "provide a notice of intent to adopt a negative declaration or mitigated negative
22 declaration to the public, responsible agencies, trustee agencies, and the county
23 clerk...sufficiently prior to adoption…to allow the pubic and agencies the review period
provided under Section 15105." They also require the lead agency to send a copy of the negative
25 declaration or mitigated negative declaration "to every responsible and trustee agency concerned 24

26 with the project and every other public agency with jurisdiction over resources affected by the
27

9 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

project.' Id. § 15073(c). Additionally, CEQA requires submission of copies of : negative
2 declaration or Mitigated Negative Declaration to the State Clearinghouse, including in situations

3 where a State agency has jurisdiction with respect to the Project and where the Projects is of is
4 statewide, regional , or area wide significance. Pub. Code 21082.1(c)(4). CEQA also requires

5 notice to and consultation with State agencies, including "transportation planning agencies" and
*public agencies which have transportation facilities within their jurisdictions which could be
affected by the project." Id. § 20192.4(a).
35. A strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an Environmental
Impact Report ("EIR") is built into CEQA which is reflected in what is known as the "fair
10 argument" standard, under which an agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence
in the record supports a fair argument a that a project may have significant effect on the 8 Channel Law Group, d71 • LZ06 12 environment. No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75, 82; Friends of "B" St.

15 Cal.App.3d 296, 309.
16 36. Under CEQA, substantial evidence includes fact, a reasonable assumption
17| predicated upon fact, or expert opinion supported by fact." Pub.Res.Code §21080(1).
18| Additionally, substantial evidence "means enough relevant information and reasonable
19 inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion, even
20 though other conclusions might also be reached.." CEQA Guidelines §15384(a)(emphasis

21 added). If there is "substantial evidence that the project might have a [a significant impact of the
22 environment], but the agency failed to secure preparation of the required EIR, the agency's
is 23 action is to be set aside because the agency abused its discretion by failing to proceed in a

(VIOLATION OF CEQA) 2

41. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
4 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

Procedural Violations of CEQA 5

6 42. The County has violated several of the procedures mandated by CEQA and

7 therefore cannot certify the MND nor grant the Project Approvals for the Project. A public

8 agency is owed no deference when it comes to procedural violations of CEQA and courts
"scrupulously enforce[] all legislatively mandated CEQA requirements." Ebbetts Pass Forest
10 Watch v Department of Forestry & Fire Protection (2008) 43 C4th 936, 944.

15 of the Notice of Intent to RAMV. The County is well aware that RAMV desired to be apprised

16 of the Project as it was Petitioner's letter dated July 19, 2021 that caused the County to send a
17 copy of the MND to the State Clearinghouse. Petitioner's letter clearly stated that the County
18 was required to "properly notify all those who have participated to date in the process [and]
19 circulate the document to the State Clearinghouse.'
20 44. The County Failed to Send Notice to Transportation Planning Agencies and

21 Public Agencies Which Have Transportation Facilities Within Riverside County. The Project is
22 located next to Interstate 215, and the proposed project thus has the potential add traffic and
23 impact a facility under Caltrans control. Therefore, the Project is of statewide, regional or area
24 wide significant. Because of this, notice must be provided to any transportation planning
25 agencies and public agencies that have transportation facilities within Riverside County that
26 could be affected by the project. See Pub Res C $21092.4(a); 14 Cal Code Regs §15072(e). For

3 ten miles of the project site. Pub Res C §21092.4(b); 14 Cal Code Regs §15072(e). The lead

4 agency should consult with public transit agencies that have facilities within 1/2 mile of the
proposed project when considering project that is not subject to the preceding notice

6 requirement. 14 Cal Code Regs §15072(e). While the County submitted the MND to the State

been provided pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15072€. Nor is there any evidence that the
9 County has consulted with public transit agencies with facilities within one-half mile of the 8

15 that the County send the Notice of Intent to the County Clerk. The Clerk is then required to post

reveals that the County did not send any such Notice of Intent to the County. However,

1 the adequacy of the MND on or about July 19, 2021. In response, on July 28, 2021 the County
2 sent Petitioner's counsel a notice of public hearing for the hearing that was originally set for
3 September 14, 2021. The County clearly failed to 'engage in the outreach to individuals and
entities that were interested in the project.' The County submitted the MND to the State
5 Clearinghouse on August 3, 2021 but completely failed to notify Petitioner of the submittal to the
6 State Clearinghouse or the new "local public review period" that ended on September 2, 2021.
7 The County never sent copies of the Notice of Completion to RAMV or Petitioner's counsel,
8 Channel Law Group. As result, the County failed to comply with Executive Order N-54-20 and

9 CEQA.

10 46. The County Failed to Provide Notice in Writing to CDFW of the Public Hearing.
The County is required by CEQA Guidelines Section 15073(e) to provide notice to the California 8
L0S MPANS d11 'dnoJg MET jeuuey) • LZ06 12 Department of Fish and Wildlife of the public hearing for the Project. This section of the
13 Guidelines states as follows: "(e) The lead agency shall notify in writing any public agency
SII!H Aueseg 14 which comments on a proposed negative declaration or mitigated negative declaration of any 8383 Wilshire 16 submitted written comments on or about September 2, 2021. There is no evidence in the Record 15 public hearing to be held for the project for which the document was prepared." CDFW

20 presented to the public agency, or noncompliance with substantive requirements of [CEQA],
21 may constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion within the meaning of Section[] ... 21168.5,

23 with those provisions." Public Resource Code § 21005(a). The County's errors in this case were 22 regardless of whether a different outcome would have resulted if the public agency had complied

24 prejudicial (among other reasons) because the failure to comply with the law resulted in a
25 subversion of the purposes of CEQA by preventing citizens from being able to comment on the
26 proposed MND and Project.

Substantiative Violation of CEQA P

48. The MND prepared by the County admitted that the Project had the potential for
3 significant environmental impacts to the following environmental resource categories: (1) 2

4 Biological Resources, (2) Cultural Resources, (3) Greenhouse Gas Emissions, (4) Hazards &
5 Hazardous Materials, (5) Paleontological Resources, (6) Tribal Cultural Resources and (&)
6 Mandatory Findings of Significance. CEQA Guidelines Section 155064(f)(1) states that an EIR
7 shall be prepared when the County has been presented with fair argument that the project may

have significant effect on the environment even when there are arguments to the contrary. As
9 explained below, Petitioner has presented a fair argument supported by substantial evidence that 8

project will have a significant impact on the environment and therefore an Environmental 10 the
1 Impact Report is required for the Project. 8
49. The County Failed to Mitigate Biological Resource Impacts and to Recirculate the -1706 d11 'dnoJ9 ME7 Channel 12 3105 VPNS SIl!H Aueneg 13 MND. In response to Petitioner's letter dated July 19, 2021, the County sent the MND to the
Clearinghouse. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW") provided
comments, recommendations and revisions to mitigation measures and new mitigation measures 14 State BJIYSI!M €8E8 16 for the Project. The Staff Report prepared for the Project indicated that the County has 15

17 incorporated these suggested revisions. However, the Staff Report failed to note that CDFW also

19| update the MND to adequately disclose impacts and measures for CDFW and the public to 18 stated as follows: "The comments and recommendations are also offered to enable the County to

20 review and comment on the proposed Project with respect to the Project's compliance with Fish

22 CEQA, recommended that the MND be revised to disclose the impacts and proposed CDFW 21 and Game Code sections 1602 and 3503, 3503.5, and 3513." CDFW, a trustee agency under

as required by CEQA Guidelines Section 23 measures and that the public be given a new opportunity to review and comment on the Project.
24 However, the County refused to recirculate the MND

26 streambed alteration were "not required by CEQA." The County added the recommended 25 15073.5. The County argued that the CDFW recommended mitigation measure pertaining to

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

measure a condition of approval but declined to make it an actual mitigation measure. This was a
violation of CEQA. The condition of approval is clearly designed to reduce the environmental

3 impacts of the Project and therefore must be included as an enforceable mitigation measure.
Additionally, recirculation is required when an MND must be "substantially revised." A

5 "substantial revision" of the negative declaration shall mean: "A new, avoidable significant
effect is identified and mitigation measures or project revisions must be added in order to reduce
the effect to insignificance." The streambed alteration mitigation measure meets this definition.
8 The County's determination that "no impact would occur to a lake or streambed" is not is

9 supported by substantial evidence. The CDFW letter stated as follows:

10

"CDFW's review of material submitted with the MND, specifically the Biological
8 Channel Law Group, d71 Technical Report (Section 4.10), and review of aerial photography, identified permanent
• LZ06 SI!!H ARS MPNS H LSIAA P3ICO Beverly 12 impacts to 0.062 acres of fish and wildlife resources subject to Fish and Game Code section 1600 et seq. within the Project site. The Project proposes to mitigate for 13 permanent impacts to fish and wildlife resources subject to Fish and Game Code section

14 1600 et seq. via the purchase of mitigation credits from an approved mitigation bank "in the event that regulatory permitting should become necessary. To ensure compliance with
15 Fish and Game Code section 1602, CDFW recommends that the County condition the
MND to include a mitigation measure requiring the Project proponent to notify CDFW
16 prior to commencing any activity that may adversely impact any river, stream, or lake... Upon receipt of a complete notification, CDFW determines if the proposed Project 17 activities may substantially adversely affect existing fish and wildlife resources and

18 whether a Lake and Streambed Alteration (LSA) Agreement is required. An LSA Agreement includes measures necessary to protect existing fish and wildlife resources.
19 CDFW may suggest ways to modify the Project that would eliminate or reduce harmful impacts to fish and wildlife resources."
20

21 50. The Project will clearly have permeant impacts to fish and wildlife resources and
22 only CDFW can determine whether those impacts may substantially adversely affect such
23 resources requiring a Lake and Streambed Alteration (LSA) Agreement. The County was
24 required to identify the measure as a "mitigation measure" and recirculate the MND per CEQA
25 Guidelines Section 15073.5(a).

26 51. Additionally, RAMV commissioned a biological report by an environmental
27 biologist (Scott Cashen) with 28 years of professional experience in wildlife biology and natural

28 16

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 resources management. Among other things, Mr. Cashen concluded that BIO MM-2 failed to

2 establish standards for the: (a) nest searching techniques, (b) minimum level of effort (i.e.,

3 survey hours per unit area), and (c) qualifications of the biologist conducting the survey. Mr.

4 Cashen noted that the ability to successfully locate nests in the Project area is dependent on these

5 three variables. Mr. Cashen further stated that "most ground-nesting birds construct nests that are

6 inconspicuous and thus hard to find a and that, as a result, successfully locating nests of ground-
7 nesting birds requires special techniques." Mr. Cashen concluded that "Because BIO MM-2 does

8 not require implementation of those techniques, it provides it no assurances that the Project would
9 avoid take of nesting birds." Mr. Cashen further concluded that "To ensure all bird nests that
10 may be affected by the Project are located, the County must establish standards for the survey

1 effort (e.g., minimum number of survey hours per unit area)." Additionally, Mr. Cashen stated 8 d11 'dnoJ9 MET |euueu) 41Z06 20  PE H MS I A B CEB 'SIl!H ÁUEAS 12 that "Because BIO MM-2 fails to establish standards for the 'qualified biologist' that would
13 conduct the nesting bird survey, it does not ensure the biologist would have the qualifications
14 needed to successfully locate all nests within the Project area prior to construction." RAMV has
15 provided substantial evidence that mitigation measure BIO MM-2 does not reduce the Project's
16 biological resource impacts to a level of insignificance. Therefore, the County cannot utilize an
17 MND as the environmental clearance document for the Project.
18 52. Additionally, Mr. Cashen indicated that "the Project has the potential to: (1)
19 introduce new weed species, and (2) facilitate the spread of existing weed species." Mr. Cashen
20 notes that the California Invasive Plant Council has published guidelines for preventing the
21 spread of invasive plants and that these Best Management Practices are feasible and should be
22 incorporated as required mitigation measures for the Project. Mr. Cashen concluded that
23 "because the MND does not incorporate mitigation, potentially significant impacts associated
24 with the colonization and spread of weeds remain unmitigated."
25 53. The Project Will Result in Significant Air Quality and Greenhouse Gas Emission
26 Impacts._An expert report was prepared by Soil Water Air Protection Enterprise ("SWAPE").
27

17 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

The SWAPE report stated "Our review concludes that the IS/MND fails to adequately evaluate
the Project's air quality, health risk, and greenhouse gas impacts. As a result, emissions and
health risk impacts associated with construction and operation of the proposed Project are
underestimated and inadequately addressed, An EIR should be prepared to adequately assess and
mitigate the potential air quality, health risk, and greenhouse gas impacts that the project may
have on the surrounding environment." According to Paul Rosenfeld, PH.D, The Air Quality
Study used incorrect information.

54. The SWAPE report states as follows: "According to the Traffic Impact Report
Analysis ("TIA"), Provided as Appendix K1 to the IS/MND, the Project relies on the City of
10 Fontana's August 2003 Truck Trip Generation Study ("Fontana Study") to determine the

8 operational vehicle fleet mix for the General Light Industrial land use." Acording to SWAPE, the
Channel Law Group, d11 The - LZ06 SIl!H LA0  VPNIET H ASUA SO CE Beverly 12 Fontana Study is an inaccurate and outdated study that was created over 14 years ago.
13 Report goes on to state, "SCAQMD staff have determined that the Fontana Study should not be
14 relied upon to determine the Project's operational mobile-source emissions."

15 55. SWAPE also concluded that the County utilized "unsubstantiated input

16 parameters to estimate project emissions." SWAPE stated as follows: "When reviewing the
17 Project's CalEEMod output files ...we found that several model inputs were not consistent with
18 information described in the IS/MND. As result, the Project's construction and operational
19 emissions are underestimated. As a result an EIR should be prepared to include am updated air
20 quality analysis that adequately evaluates impacts that construction and operation of the project
21 will have on local and regional air quality."
22 56. SWAPE also concluded that the County utilized "unsubstantiated changes to
23 operational off-road equipment." SWAPE indicated that a "review of CalEEMod output files
24 | demonstrate that the Harvill and Rider Warehouse PPT190039 (Operations -Passenger Cars) and
25 Harvill and Rider Warehouse PPT190039 (Operations - Trucks) models assume the Project
26 would include Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) tractor would operate for 4 hours per day."
27

28 18

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 57. SWAPE also concluded that the County utilized an "unsubstantiated operational
2 fleet mix." SWAPE noted that "The TIA report uses the SCAQMD recommendation of a truck

3 mix of 32.2% for a High Cube Warehouse. The TIA instead inaccurately found the truck fleet

4 mix at 20% trucks. Underestimating the percentage of trucks in the fleet also influences mobile

5 source operational emissions. Which is a 12.2% increase." SWAPE concluded that the "Project

6 should not rely upon the Fontana Study to determine operational vehicle fleet mix percentages."
7 Instead of relying on an outdated, inadequate, and inapplicable study, SWAPE recommended
8 "that the Project use the SCAQMD recommended warehouse fleet mix of 32.2% daily trucks."
9 58. SWAPE performed an updated CalEEMod model and found the Projects
10 construction related VOC emissions exceed the applicable SCAQMD threshold of 75 pounds.
1 59. SWAPE's analysis also demonstrated numerous flaws in the IS/MND regarding 8 Channel Law Group, d77 41Z06 12 Diesel Matter Particulate Health Risk. SWAPE concluded that the County's diesel particulate

8 OYNS "PAIE BJJYS|!M €888 13 health risk analysis was inadequate. In addition, SWAPE concluded that the IS/MND failed to
'S|l!H Aueseg 14 adequately analyze the amount of dirt that will be removed and fill added to the Project site.
15 According to SWAPE, this underestimate will result in substantial construction hours on site and
16 off site and increased emissions such as Diesel Particulate Matter.
17 60. SWAPE also concluded that the County failed to adequately evaluate greenhouse
18 gas impacts. SWAPE concluded that the IS/MND improperly relied upon the Project's
19 consistency with the Riverside County Climate Action Plan ("CAP") in order to conclude the
20 Project would result in a less than significant greenhouse gas ("GHG") impact. Specifically, the
21 IS/MND estimates that the project would generate net annual GHG emissions of 4,008.62 metric
22 tons of carbon dioxide equivalents per year "MT CO2e/year"), which would exceed the County's
23 Screening threshold of 3,000 MT COze/year threshold.
24 61. A fair argument supported by substantial evidence has been provided that the
25 Project will have a significant impact on the environment and therefore the County must prepare
26 an EIR.

2 62. The Project Will Result in Significant Geology and Soils Impacts. RAMV
3 submitted an expert report from Walker Consultants, Ltd. This report demonstrated that the
MND is defective and fails to mitigate the Project's impacts to a level of insignificance. The

5 report states as follows:

6

7 "[T]he report does not mention the need to excavate and re-compact the backfill soil in the two underground storage tank (UST) excavations which extend to an estimated depth
8 12 feet below ground surface (bgs). This estimated 12-foot depth is considerably deeper
than the grading over-excavation which will only extend to 5 to 8 feet bgs.

The report provides only one cursory mention (Appendix D, page 2) regarding the need 10 to properly clean-out/remove/abandon septic systems under county permit. It is unlikely
1 that the septic systems, particularly the seepage pit(s), have been removed and/or
® properly abandoned during site demolition. If there was past improper disposal of
•LZ06 12 hazardous wastes into the septic system then the removal/abandonment may be more 440 Vpo NE d11 'dnoJg MET jeuuey) extensive and complicated and may involve the USEPA. 13
The report does not mention the need to continuously observe for presence of SIl!H Auereg 14 contaminated soil (discoloration and/or odors) during demolition, grading and
8383 Wilshi 15 construction, particularly regarding the former UST systems, the septic systems, beneath
the corn-only feeder, beneath the storage shed and beneath the loading dock."
16

63. The report from Walker Consultants, Ltd. Clearly demonstrated that the
18 environmental analysis undertaken by the County was deficient and that new mitigation 17

19 measures are required to reduce significant impacts associated with the Project.

20 64. Further, the project site contains alluvial soil that is not well suited for building.
This soil must be removed and new soil added. The Geotechnical Investigation Report that was
22 conducted by the County states "the fill soils are not considered suitable for the support of the 21

23 new structure. The recommended remedial grading should also remove any existing fill materials
24 from the proposed building pad area." Appendix E1 - Geotechnical Investigation Report, Page

25 1). Approximately 28,000 cubic yards of imported fill soil is required. However, the air quality
26 analysis that was performed by the County did not take into consideration the impacts of this
27 hauling. Import and export of fill dirt requires large number of haul trucks. The number of

20 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 quality analysis. The MND is therefore inaccurate because it understates the impacts of the 1 hours for equipment used to import and export the fill dirt was not included in the County air

3 Project and shows no imported fill needed.

4 65. Additionally, the MND erred when it concluded that "all runoff generated will be
5 directed to the south and [] will gravity flow into a bio-retention basin designed to be located

6 near the southwestern corner of the site along with an engineered outlet structure. Water quality
7 flows will be fully captured by the basin and the runoff would be filtered through the bio-
8 retention basin media before being pumped into the engineer outlet structure." However, the
southwest corner of the project site is not suited for a water quality basin. The MND at Appendix
10 E2, page 5, states: "Hard pan soil in the southwestern portion of the site where the detention 9

1 basin is located. Based on low infiltration rates that location is not suitable. The detention basin 8 d77 'dnoJ5 MET |ouueuo LIZ06 12 must be located in the southeastern portion of the site. The current basin location will not

8 e}NS "PALE EJIUSI!M €8€8 13 function." Further, is there is only one basin outlined in the approved plans. Moreover, the MND at
'SIl!H Beverly 14| Appendix E2 page 5, stated that "Infiltration testing concluded that infiltration was very low or
15 non-existent in the Southwestern portion of the site where the water quality basin is located."
Even though this was included in the Geological Report the retention basin is still located in the
17 Southwestern corner of the Project site. The MND's conclusions were clearly flawed and not 16

18 supported by substantial evidence the water quality detention basin for the Project will not
19 function as designed and must be relocated.

21 Guidelines define cumulative impacts as "two or more individual effects which, when considered 20 66. The County Failed to Adequately Consider Cumulative Impacts. The CEQA

22 together, are considerable or which compound or increase other environmental impacts." 14 Cal
23 Code Regs §15355. The individual effects may be changes resulting from a single project or

25  individually minor but collectively significant projects taking place over a period of time. 14 Cal 24 more than one project. 14 Cal Code Regs §15355(a). Cumulative impacts may result from

26 Code Regs §15355(b). A cumulative impact is an impact created by the combination of the

21 27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

project reviewed in the EIR together with other projects causing related impacts. 14 Cal Code
Regs §15130(a)(1). The cumulative impact from several projects is the change in the
environment that results from the incremental effect of the project when added to other past,
present, and probable future projects. 14 Cal Code Regs $§15065(a)(3), 15130(b)(1)(A),
15355(b).

8, 2021 (Plot Plan No. 190032 & CEQ190121). This project is located approximately 118 feet 67. Notably, the County approved another warehouse and distribution facility on June

away from the instant Project. The distance between the two warehouses buildings is just 200
feet. Despite the acknowledged significant environmental impacts associated with such
10 facilities, the County failed to adequately consider the cumulative impacts of this Project.
According to the MND conducted by the County for the other warehouse facility, "[c]onstruction 2
LZ06 d11 'dnoJg MET jeuueus 12 is expected to begin early 2021 and is expected to last for 10 months." For the instant Project, the

8 euns "pAja BJJySIM €888 13 MND states that construction is expected to be completed in 12 to 15 months after approval. 4.
SII!H Áueseg 14 The evidence demonstrates that BOTH of these projects are expected to be constructed at
same time and therefore the County was obligated to consider the cumulative
16| impacts of the Project on all the environmental resources categories analyzed. That did not 15 roughly the

17| happen.
Failure to Disclose and Mitigate Hazards. The MND also failed to disclose a
19 | potentially hazardous situation created by the Project. For example, a railroad crossing in close 18 68.

20 proximity to the warehouse entrance is not adequately disclosed and evaluated. _Trucks and
21 vehicles will be entering and exiting just a few feet south of a very narrow, winding, dipping and
22 dangerous railroad crossing. The proposed driveway for the project is not adequate. Real Party
23 proposes to construct an intersection near the railroad crossing at Driveway 1. Design features
24 include a driveway on Harvill Ave. just south of the railroad crossing that allows trucks to turn
25 left and right into the facility without a left turn lane.

To Whom It May Concern:
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under California Public Resources Code section 21167.5, that Petitioner, Rural Association of Mead Valley, intends to immediately file a Petition for Writ of Mandate (*Petition") under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), inter alia, against the County of Riverside ("County") and Real Party in Interest Duke Realty Corporation. The Petition will be filed in Riverside County Superior Court and will allege, inter alia, that the County failed to comply with CEQA when it adopted : I Mitigated Negative Declaration for the proposed development known as "Harvill and Rider Street Warehouse Project ("Project"). The Project involves the construction and operation of one (1) approximately 334,922 square foot (SF) warehouse building with approximately 10,990 SF of 1st floor office, 7,850 SF of office mezzanine, 316,082 SF of warehouse, 41 dock doors, parking for automobiles and trucks, one (1) water quality detention basin, and associated improvements (HPA, 2020a). Petitioner contends that the Project is not eligible for Mitigated Negative Declaration due to the significant environmental effects associated with the
Project.
