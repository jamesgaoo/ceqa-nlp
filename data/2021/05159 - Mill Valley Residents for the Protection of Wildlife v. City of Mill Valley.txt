26 ("Petitioner" or "MVRPW") filed a First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

27 ("Verified Petition") against the City of Mill Valley (the "City" or "Respondent") in Marin

28 County Superior Court. Petitioner alleges that the City violated the California Environmental
Quality Act ("CEQA") by its adoption of amendments to Chapter 15.04 of the Mill Valley

2 Municipal Code to modify Section 4907 of the California Fire Code to implement certain

3 vegetation management requirements (the "Project"). The City adopted the Project by way

4 Ordinance No. 1309 on September 16, 2019. The City subsequently rescinded and adopted of

5 the Project by way of Ordinance No. 1312 (adopted by the City Council of Mill Valley on

6 December 2, 2019) which purported to rescind and then reapprove the changes to the Mill

7 Valley Municipal Code at issue in Petitioner's original petition. The City did not prepare an

8 initial study, a negative declaration, a mitigated negative declaration, or an environmental

9 impact report prior to approving Ordinance No. 1312 and illegally exempted the Project from
review under CEQA, Pub. Res. Code section 21000 et seq.

10

11 Petitioner alleges that the City adopted the Project before conducting an

12 environmental review of the impact that the Project may have on the environment, and that

13 the City is not exempt from CEQA pursuant to Section 15061(b)(3) of Title 14 of the

14 California Code of Regulations because substantial evidence in the record supports a fair

15 argument that the Project will have a significant effect on the environment and that this
exemption does not apply.

PETITIONER'S AMENDED PETITION - Case No. CIV1903965
523430.2

Petitioner MILL VALLEY RESIDENTS FOR THE PROTECTION OF

2 WILDLIFE, an Unincorporated Association (*MVRPW" or "Petitioner") hereby amends its

3 petition to the Court for a writ of mandate ordering Defendant and Respondent City of Mill

4 Valley ("City" or "Respondent") to rescind its adoption of amendments to Chapter 15.04 of

5 the Mill Valley Municipal Code to modify Section 4907 of the California Fire Code to

6 implement certain vegetation management requirements (the "Project"). The City adopted

7 the Project by way of Ordinance No. 1309 on September 16, 2019. The City subsequently

8 rescinded and adopted the Project by way of Ordinance No. 1312 (adopted by the City

q Council of Mill Valley on December 2, 2019) which purported to rescind and then reapprove

10 the changes to the Mill Valley Municipal Code at issue in its original petition. Ordinance

11 No. 1309 and Ordinance No. 1312 are referred to collectively as "the Ordinances." Petitioner

12 brings this public interest citizens suit to enforce the California Environmental Quality Act

13 ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq.

14 By this First Amended Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate (the "Amended

15 Petition"), MVRPW alleges as follows:

16 THE PARTIES

17 1. Petitioner MVRPW is a non-profit unincorporated association whose

18 members reside and own property in the City and are dedicated to protecting critical plant and

19 animal habitats through science, policy, education, and environmental law. Petitioner has a

20 beneficial interest in the outcome of the proceedings due to, among other things, the nature of

21 the project at issue in the proceedings (defined below beginning at paragraph 10) and because

22 Petitioner's members reside and own property in Mill Valley, Marin County, California and

23 use publicly accessible portions of the Project area and surrounding areas for recrcation,

24 wildlife viewing, and educational purposes.

25 2. On information and belief, Respondent City is a local governmental

26 agency and political subdivision of the State of California charged with the authority to

27 regulate and administer land use activities within its boundaries, subject at all times to the

28 obligations and limitations of all applicable state, federal, and other laws, including CEQA

Page
PETITIONER'S AMENDED PETITION - Case No. CIV1903965
523430.2

1 and the CEQA Guidelines. Respondent also has the authority to legislate changes to land use

2 and policy within its jurisdiction. Respondent is the lead agency under CEQA for the

3 preparation of the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") and for approval of the Project.

4 3. The true names and capacities of Respondents DOES 1-100, inclusive,

5 are unknown to Petitioner who therefore sued such Respondents by such fictitious names

6 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 474. Petitioners will, with leave of court if

7 necessary, further amend this Amended Petition when the true names and capacities of said

8 DOE Respondents have been ascertained.

9 JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

10 4. This Court has jurisdiction of this proceeding pursuant to Section 1085

11 of the Code of Civil Procedure and Section 21168.5 of the Public Resource Code.

12 Alternatively, this Court has jurisdiction of this proceeding pursuant to Section 1094.5 of the

13 Code of Civil Procedure and Section 21168 of the Public Resource Code.

14 5. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Section 394 of the Code of

15 Civil Procedure because the acts performed by the Respondent, including the violations of

16 law and statutes, took place in Marin County. In addition, the Project will be implemented in

17 Marin County and will therefore affect Petitioner's members who reside in Marin County and

18 Marin County's environment, as further detailed herein.

19 6. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies by submitting

20 multiple written correspondence on the Project via email and personal delivery to the City to

21 request compliance with CEQA, including the completion of full and adequate environmental

22 review. All issues raised in this Amended Petition were raised before Respondents by

23 Petitioner, other members of the public, or public agencies prior to approval of the Project.

24 7. Petitioner has complied with Section 21167.5 of the Public Resource

25 Code by serving the City with written notice of Petitioner's intent to commence this action

26 and written notice of its intent to amend its original petition. A true and correct copy of these

27 written notices are attached hereto as Exhibits A and B.

28 8. Petitioner has already prepared the record of proceedings, which the

Page 2
PETITIONER'S AMENDED PETITION - Case No. CIV1903965
523430.2

City reviewed and certified on January 22, 2020. A true and correct copy of the Notification

2 of Intent to Prepare the Administrative Record and Certification of Administrative Record is
attached hereto as Exhibits C and D. Petitioner intends to move to supplement the Certified
Administrative Record with additional materials that it has since discovered after it filed its

5 original petition on October 16, 2019.

6 9. This Amended Petition is timely filed in accordance with Section 473 of

7 the California Code of Civil Procedure and relates back to its original petition, which was

8 timely filed under Section 21167 of the Public Resource Code and Section 15112 of the

9 CEQA Guidelines. Both the original petition and this Amended Petition relate to the same

10 general set of facts amendments to Chapter 15.04 of the Mill Valley Municipal Code to

11 modify Section 4907.2 of the California Fire Code to implement additional vegetation

12 management requirements. This Amended Petition also seeks relief for the same injuries as

13 detailed below in paragraphs 10-20 and refers to the same incident - the adoption of the

14 Project.

15 THE PROJECT

16 10. The Project requires Mill Valley property owners within the Wildlife

17 Urban Interface area ("WUI") to remove ten (10) species of plants from the entirety of each

18 parcel of land they own and to maintain the property free of the "banned" vegetation

19 commencing May 1, 2021.

20 11. The Project further requires property owners within the WUI, to comply

21 by May 1, 2021 as follows:

22 a) remove all "pyrophytic vegetation" within 10 feet of property
23 lines and within thirty (30) feet of structures "as determined by the Fire Chief or his/her
24 designee;"

25 b) cut and remove tree limbs within 10 feet of decks and roofs;

26 c) raise crowns of all trees by cutting and removing growth less

27 than three (3) inches in diameter, from the ground up to a minimum height of 10 feet; and,

28 that grasses be cut and maintained at the height of 3 inches or shorter, among other

Page 3
PETITIONER'S AMENDED PETITION - Case No. CIV1903965
523430.2

1 requirements, with "exceptions" only being subject to the "approval of the Fire Chief."

2 12. The Project further places the burden of environmental impact review

3 and reporting on the property owner "when the removal of trees and/or vegetation under the

4 Project will affect threatened or endangered species" by requiring that the property owner

5 hire a "qualified biologist to conduct a species survey and prepare a mitigation plan."

6 13. The Project calls for "voluntary" clearance of all vegetation (other than

7 succulents) within the first 3 feet of all structures and for the installation of hardscape

8 material within the 3 feet area. 3

9 14. Respondent has pushed-through and adopted the Project (via Ordinance

10 No. 1309 and duplicative Ordinance No. 1312) without compliance with state laws protecting

11 the environment and in violation of the due process rights of the City's property owners - of

12 which approximately 5,000 parcels in the WUI are immediately affected.

13 15. The Project will require the removal of significant vegetation, affecting

14 no less than 5,000 residential structures, and critical habitat for numerous threatened and

15 endangered species. As is evident from its unique and beautiful topography, Mill Valley

16 contains critical vegetative habitat for numerous threatened and endangered species

17 including, the California red-legged frog, steelhead and coho salmon, the California tiger

18 salamander and the Northern spotted owl, in addition to the California giant salamander

19 which is classified as a "California Species of Concern" and "near threatened."

20 16. The Project will eradicate a significant amount of the City's vegetative

21 landscape thereby causing an overwhelming direct physical change in the entire environment

22 encompassed by the Ordinances and even beyond the City limits, overflowing into the

23 surrounding Marin County lands. Given the rich diversity of the City's vegetative landscape,

24 the Project will not only affect the City's biological resources, but will also have significant

25 aesthetic impacts.

26 17. The potential effects on the environment and threatened and endangered

27 species will undoubtedly be felt even outside of the Project area of the 5,000 residences in the

28 WUI, as these threatened and endangered species migrate, nest and reproduce in the

Page 4
PETITIONER'S AMENDED PETITION - Case No. CIV1903965
523430.2

1 surrounding County lands and waterways adjacent to the City limits in addition to within the

2 City limits targeted by the Project.

3 18. The Project will result in extreme, aggressive and sweeping eradication

4 of critical habitat for threatened and endangered species, and the resulting "taking" of

5 personal property from private landowners without due process.

6 19. The Project will result in significant removal of vegetation which will

7 cause dangerous erosion and flooding risks.

8 20. The Project will also result in the unnecessary destruction of

9 California's native plant heritage, diminishment of water quality, loss of cultural resources

10 and habitat for wildlife, and loss of hillside stability for the purpose of wildfire vegetation

11 management.

12 BACKGROUND OF PROJECT AND PROCEEDINGS

13 21. On November 7, 2016, the City adopted by reference the 2016

14 California Fire Code of Regulations Title 24, Part 9, as modified by Ordinance No. 1286.

15 22. On or about August 6, 2018, a draft of what is now Ordinance No. 1309

16 was introduced during regular meeting of the City. The City's Fire Chief prepared and
17 presented a Staff Report to support adopting Ordinance No. 1309 a which had a stated purpose

18 of enabling "the creation of survivable properties during wildland conflagration."

19 23. An EIR was not prepared in connection with Ordinance No. 1309.

20 24. On or about June 17, 2019, Ordinance No. 1309 was discussed during a

21 regular meeting of the City.

22 25. On or about August 5, 2019, Ordinance No. 1309 was discussed during

23 a regular meeting.

24 26. On or about September 5, 2019, Ordinance No. 1309 was discussed

25 during a regular meeting.

26 27. On or around September 16, 2019, the City passed and adopted

27 Ordinance No. 1309, with an effective date of thirty days after its adoption.

28 28. The City conducted no environmental review under CEQA before

Page 5
PETITIONER'S AMENDED PETITION -Case No. CIV1903965
523430.2

adopting the Ordinance and, therefore failed to proceed in a manner required by law.

2 29. The City improperly contends that Ordinance No. 1309 is categorically

3 exempt from environmental review under CEQA pursuant to Sections 15301, 15304, 15307

4 and 15308 of Title 14 of the California Code of Regulations. However, substantial evidence

5 in the record supports a fair argument that the Project will result in significant environmental

6 impacts as set forth herein and that these exceptions do not apply.

7 30. Ordinance No. 1309 will foreseeably result in significant effects on the

8 environment and on Petitioner.

q 31. Prior to the City's passage and adoption of Ordinance No. 1309,

10 Petitioner and members of the public submitted numerous detailed comments concerning the

11 Project, including the need for the City to comply with CEQA, the need for the City to

12 complete a full and adequate EIR concerning the Project, and that the City was not exempted

13 from complying with CEQA.

14 32. Prior to approving Ordinance No. 1309, the City did not prepare an
15 initial study, a negative declaration, a mitigated negative declaration, or an EIR, despite the

16 fact that its amendments to Section 4907 of the California Fire Code is a project subject to

17 CEQA that will have a demonstrably adverse impact on the environment.

18 33. Petitioner timely filed its original petition challenging the Project on

19 October 17, 2019.

20 34. During the pendency of this action, the City adopted Ordinance
21 No. 1312. Ordinance No. 1312 adopted by reference the 2019 California Fire Code of

22 Regulations "deleted and replaced in its entirety" Chapter 14.04 [sic] of the Mill Valley

23 Municipal Code.

24 35. The City first introduced Ordinance No. 1312 during a City Council

25 meeting on November 4, 2019. At the November 4, 2019, meeting, the City Attorney stated

26 that the vegetation management language of Ordinance No. 1312 was "identical" to the

27 vegetation management language of Ordinance No. 1309, which is the subject of this action.

28 The City did not read Ordinance No. 1312 during its meeting or hold a public hearing about

Page 6
PETITIONER'S AMENDED PETITION - Case No. CIV1903965
523430.2

the Ordinance that would allow Mill Valley citizens to comment.

2 36. The City adopted Ordinance No. 1312 on December 2, 2019, the same

3 day that it had a public hearing on Ordinance No. 1312. The City did not prepare an initial

4 study, a negative declaration, a mitigated negative declaration, or an EIR prior to approving

5 Ordinance No. 1312.

6 37. On October 15, 2020, the City filed an untimely "Supplemental

7 Briefing" with the Court arguing for the first time that the challenge to the Project was

8 "moot" because of the City's adoption of Ordinance No. 1312, which rescinded and then

9 readopted the amendments to the Mill Valley Municipal Code challenged herein.

10 38. On December 3, 2019, the day after the City adopted Ordinance No.

11 1312, the City and its counsel participated in the mandatory, in-person CEQA settlement

12 conference. The City did not argue during this meeting that Petitioner's action was moot due

13 to the adoption of Ordinance No. 1312 on December 2, 2019.

14 39. On January 22, 2020, the City, pursuant to Section 21167.6.2(f) of the

15 Public Resource Code, certified that the administrative record in this action was accurate and

16 contained "[a]ll [….]related documents prepared by respondent public agency with respect to

17 [..] the action on the project". The City did not argue that Petitioner's action was moot due

18 to the adoption of Ordinance No. 1312 on December 2, 2019.

19 40. On February 21, 2020, the City filed its answer to the original petition.

20 The City did not assert in its answer that Petitioner's action was moot due to the adoption of

21 Ordinance No. 1312 on December 2, 2019.

22 41. On April 23, 2020, the City filed its brief in opposition to Petitioner's

23 opening brief in support of its original petition. The City did not assert in its opposition brief

24 that Petitioner's action was moot due to the adoption of Ordinance No. 1312 on December 2,

25 2019.

26 42. Between April 8 and September 15, 2020, counsel for the City and

27 counsel for Petitioner participated in nine (9) telephonic settlement discussions and

28 exchanged numerous communications regarding settlement. Counsel for the City never

Page 7
PETITIONER'S AMENDED PETITION - Case No. CIV1903965
523430.2

asserted during any of these settlement communications that Petitioner's action was moot due

2 to the adoption of Ordinance No. 1312 on December 2, 2019.

3 43. The City first raised its "mootness" argument to Petitioner on

4 October 2, 2020, during a further settlement discussion.

5 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (VIOLATION OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

7 44. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference all the

8 allegations of Paragraphs 1 through 43, inclusive, of this Amended Petition.

9 45. Respondent's actions in approving the Project constitute a prejudicial

10 abuse of discretion in that Respondent failed to proceed in the manner required by law and its

11 decisions are not supported by substantial evidence, as more fully set forth below:

12 (a) The City failed to prepare an EIR.

13 (b) The City's finding that the Project is categorically exempt from
14 environmental review under Section 15301 of the California Code of Regulations because it

15 requires residents to repair and maintain existing landscaping and native growth is not

16 supported by the record. In fact, the record contains substantial evidence to support a fair

17 argument that the Project will result in major alterations to land, including eradication of a

18 significant amount of the City's vegetative landscape.

19 (c) The City's findings that the Project is categorically exempt from

20 environmental review under Section 15304 of the California Code of Regulations because it

21 would require minor public or private alterations in the condition of land and vegetation is not

22 supported by the record. In fact, the record contains substantial evidence to support a fair

23 argument that the Project will result in significant environmental impacts, including

24 significant impacts on threatened and endangered species, and a "taking" of personal property

25 from private landowners without due process.

26 (d) The City's findings that the Project is categorically exempt from

27 environmental review under Sections 15307 and 15308 of the California Code of Regulations

28 because it would protect natural resources and the environment is not supported by the

Page 8
PETITIONER'S AMENDED PETITION - Case No. CIV1903965
523430.2

1 record. In fact, the record contains substantial evidence to support a fair argument that the

2 Project will result in such impacts, including significant impacts on threatened and

3 endangered species, unnecessary destruction of California's native plant heritage,

4 diminishment of water quality, loss of cultural resources, and loss of hillside stability.

5 (e) The City failed to adequately respond to comments by Petitioner

6 and other members of the public about the Project prior to its adoption of the Project (via

7 Ordinance No. 1309 on September 16, 2019, and Ordinance No. 1312 on December 2, 2019).

8 (f) The substantial evidence in the administrative record supports a

9 fair argument that the Project will have a significant impact on the environment.

10 (g) The City's findings do not adequately disclose the evidence it

11 relied onl and assert conclusory statements unsupported by evidence or factual information.

12 46. Petitioner exhausted its administrative remedies by, inter alia,

13 submitting timely comments on the Project to Respondent, and by demanding that

14 Respondent conduct an adequate environmental review of the Project in compliance with

15 CEQA.

16 47. Respondent's failure to prepare an EIR precluded an analysis of

17 alternatives to the Project. Pursuant to CEQA, Respondent had duty to identify range of

18 reasonable alternatives and to describe these alternatives in sufficient detail to be of

19 informational value to themselves and to the public. The discussion of alternatives is

20 required to focus on those that were capable of substantially reducing or eliminating any

21 significant adverse environmental effects. Because an EIR was not prepared, there was no

22 analysis of alternatives that are capable of achieving the Project's goals and of substantially

23 reducing the adverse environmental impacts.

24 48. The failure to prepare an EIR also precluded an effective analysis of the

25 cumulative effects of the Project with other projects and/or impacts in the region. CEQA

26 requires that a lead agency analyze not only the environmental effects of a project within the

27 project's own boundaries, but the cumulative impacts the project will have in an area-wide or

28 regional context, including cumulative effects along with other projects. The cumulative

Page S
PETITIONER'S AMENDED PETITION - Case No. CIV1903965
523430.2

1 environmental impacts of the Project in conjunction with other projects were not examined.

2 These cumulative impacts should have been studied and mitigated to the maximum extent

3 feasible.

4 49. Respondent has the clear, present legal duty and present legal authority

5 and ability to comply with CEQA. However, Respondent has failed and refused to perform

6 that duty and has abused its discretion in failing to comply with CEQA. Respondent's failure

7 and refusal is arbitrary and capricious. Respondent's decision to approve the Project is not

8 supported by substantial evidence. The standard of review is set forth in Cal. Pub. Res. Code

9 § 21168.5.

10 50. Respondent's actions of approving the Project are invalid and do not

11 comply with CEQA for the reasons set forth above. In failing to comply with CEQA and the

12 CEQA Guidelines and by failing to prepare a full a EIR for the Project, Respondent has

13 committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that it has not proceeded in a manner required

14 by law and in that the determination to approve the Project is not supported by substantial
15 evidence.

•16 51. The public interest will suffer from Respondent's failure to perform its

17 clear public duty to comply with CEQA by preparing and certifying a legally adequate EIR.

18 Respondent's failure to perform the reviews required by CEQA undermines the CEQA goals

19 of alerting the public and Respondent to environmental changes before they have reached the

20 point of ecological no return. It deprives Respondent of the opportunity to mitigate

21 environmental impacts. It fails to protect the environment and the interest of providing

22 informed self-government. In the absence of adequate information and mitigation measures,

23 the public and the environment will be significantly and adversely affected by numerous

24 environmental harms.

25 52. Petitioner has incurred substantial costs and attorneys' fees that will

26 continue to accrue in an amount not yet determined. Petitioner is entitled to an award of

27 attorneys' fees if it prevails in this action as provided in California Code of Civil Procedure §

28 1021.5 and other applicable statutes because this action seeks to enforce important rights

Page 10
PETITIONER'S AMENDED PETITION - Case No. CIV1903965
523430.2

1 affecting the public interest which, if enforced, will confer significant benefits on the general

2 public. Petitioner will seek an award of fees and costs.

3 53. Petitioner's Amended Petition is timely because as discussed above in

4 paragraph 9, it relates to the same Project (i.e. the same amendments to Chapter 15.04 of the

5 Mill Valley Municipal Code to modify Section 4907.2 of the California Fire Code) to

6 implement new and/or additional vegetation management requirements. The City's adoption

7 of Ordinance No. 1312 (which re-approved the Project) was merely in furtherance of the

8 Project that the City originally approved on September 16, 2019. If a public agency

9 subsequently approves an action that relates to the underlying project, this does not constitute

10 a separate "approval" for purposes of a triggering the statute of limitations in a CEQA matter.

11 See e.g., Van de Kamps Coal. v. Bd. of Trustees of Los Angeles Cmty. Coll. Dist., 206 Cal.

12 App. 4th 1036, 1045 (2012).

13 54. In the alternative, if the City's approval of Ordinance No. 1312 is a new

14 approval of the Project, this action is timely because it was filed within 180 days of October

15 2, 2020, which is the earliest that that Petitioner could have discovered that the City's

16 position that Ordinance No. 1312 represented a new discretionary approval subject to

17 independent challenge.

18 55. The City is estopped from arguing that the 180-day statute of limitations

19 to challenge Ordinance No. 1312 has run under Section 21167(d) of the Public Resource

20 Code because the City did not assert that approval of Ordinance No. 1312 made the City's

21 approval of Ordinance No. 1309 "moot" a until a settlement discussion on October 2, 2020, at a

22 point at which the City believed the statute of limitations had run. Petitioner relied on the

23 City's conduct since its filing of its original Petition on October 17, 2019, and therefore did

24 not amend its Petition earlier. The City's conduct included:

25 its participation in the mandatory, in-person CEQA settlement

26 conference on December 3, 2019, where it never asserted that its re-

27 adoption of the same language regarding vegetation management and

28 same amendments to the Fire Code being challenged in the initial

Page 11
PETITIONER'S AMENDED PETITION - Case No. CIV1903965
523430.2

1 CEQA Petition "mooted" the original Petition;

2 its certification on January 22, 2020 that the administrative record in

3 this action was accurate and contained all related documents regarding

4 argue that it believed that its adoption of the Project. The City failed to

5 Ordinance No. 1312 "mooted" Petitioner's original petition in its

6 opposition to Petitioner's brief on April 23, 2020, despite including a 2-

7 page historical discussion about its adoption of the revised vegetation

8 management ordinance. (Opp., 11:24-13:18).

9 its failure to inform Petitioner's counsel that it believed that its

10 adoption of Ordinance No. 1312 "mooted" Petitioner's original petition

11 during nine telephone calls and numerous email exchanges regarding

12 settlement that the City's counsel had with Petitioner's counsel

13 between April 8 and September 15, 2020.

14 A reasonable person in Petitioner's position would have relied on the City's

15 above referenced conduct and would not have filed a separate challenge to the adoption of

16 Ordinance No. 1312, which merely adopted amendments to the Fire Code that were identical

17 to the amendments at issue in the current lawsuit. As soon as Petitioner learned that the City

18 took the position that its adoption of Ordinance No. 1312, which re-adopted the same

19 language regarding vegetation management being challenged in the Petition, Petitioner

20 diligently sought leave to file this Amended Petition.

21 PETITIONER IS ENTITLED TO RELIEF

22 56. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference all the

23 allegations of Paragraphs 1 through 55, inclusive, of this Amended Petition.

24 57. Petitioner is beneficially interested in the City's adoption of the Project,

25 because the City's approval of this Project poses environmental impacts that will harm

26 Petitioner's members and their real property.

27 58. Petitioner timely seeks appropriate mandamus and other equitable or

28 legal relief as the Court sees proper to prevent the City from attempting to implement any part

Page 12
PETITIONER'S AMENDED PETITION - Case No. CIV1903965
523430.2

1 of the Project before this action is resolved on its merits.

2 59. An actual controversy exists between Petitioner and the City. Petitioner

3 contends that the City has acted in violation of applicable law as alleged herein above, and
must therefore vacate and set aside its adoption of the Project. Petitioner is informed and

5 believes, and thereon alleges, that the City disputes these contentions. A judicial resolution

6 of this controversy is therefore necessary and appropriate.

7 60. At all times mentioned herein, the City was able to conduct

8 environmental review and analysis of the Project as required by CEQA. Nonetheless, the

9 City has failed and continues to fail to perform its duty to conduct this required

10 environmental review and analysis under CEQA.

11 61. If the City is not ordered to set aside its approval of the Project,

12 Petitioner and the public will be irreparably harmed. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and

13 adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. Unless this Court issues its Writ of Mandate

14 or grants relief vacating the City's approval of the Project, and requires the City to comply

15 with CEQA, the City's adoption of the Project challenged herein would violate applicable

16 law. No monetary damages or other legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioner for

17 the harm that will be caused to by the lack of essential environmental reviews, harm to

18 property interests, harm to the environment, and violations Due Process rights of the City's

19 property owners threatened by the City's approval of the Project.

20 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

21 1. For a preemptory writ of mandate directing Respondent:

22 a, to vacate and set aside approval of the Project;
23 b. to comply with CEQA before any subsequent action is taken to
24 implement the Project;

25 C. the City be prevented from implementing the Project unless and until

26 Respondent has complied with all requirements of CEQA and all other

27 applicable state and local laws, policies, ordinances, and regulations as
