I. INTRODUCTION
3
1. This Petition concerns the proposed development in the City of Fontana of two
4 high-cube warehouses known as the Fontana Foothills Commerce Center totaling approximately
5 754408 square feet on roughly 33.55 acres at the northeast corner of Juniper Avenue and Jurupa
6 Avenue ("the Project"). The Draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") for the Project
7 acknowledged that there would be significant impacts with respect to air quality and greenhouse
8 gas ("GHG") emissions, but the City Council of the City of Fontana nevertheless approved it on
9 a 3-2 vote. A true and correct copy of a regional map disclosing the location of the Project,
10 DEIR Exhibit 3.0-1, is included herein as Figure 1. A true and correct copy of a local map
11 disclosing the location of the Project (in yellow) is included herein as Figure 2.

2 The Project would lead to at least an additional 342 trucks per day (mostly'large

3 semis) on roads that are already overly crowded with them, as well as an additional 716 cars per

4 day visiting the site. The Project is surrounded by residential development on at least three sides

5 - to the south, west and east, with residentially-zoned homes being located 15 feet to the east, a
large tract 134
6 feet to the south, and another home being located 86 feet to the west. The

7 surrounding community is in the 99th percentile for pollution burden, and in the 98th percentile

8 for impacts from ozone pollution, according to the Office of Environmental Health Hazard

9 Assessment's ("OEHHA's") CalEnviroscreen 3.0 tool.

3.
10 Despite the proximity of already heavily impacted residents, and in spite of

11 California Air Resources Board ("CARB") recommendations that take this step, the City failed

12 to require a construction health risk assessment which might have disclosed that the Project

13 would have significant health risks under the South Coast Air Quality Management District's

14 ("SCAQMD's") 10-in-a-million additional cancers standard.

2 The City did not comply with CEQA in the following important ways:

t The City failed to acknowledge the true extent of air quality and GHG impacts
even though they deemed the Project's impacts significant in some respects.

5 The City refused to acknowledge significant land use and planning impacts even

6 though there are a number of them.

7 The DEIR and Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR") failed to analyze a

8 reasonable range of alternatives, and the City failed to adopt the Reduced Density

9 Alternative it was required to adopt to reduce the significant impacts of the

10 Project.

11 The City's consultants failed to conduct an adequate assessment to confirm the

12 absence of the burrowing owl ("BUOW"), in violation of the California

13 Department of Fish & Wildlife's 2012 Staff Report.

14 The DEIR's analysis of population and housing and growth-inducing impacts was

15 inadequate.

16 The City failed to impose entirely feasible and reasonable mitigation measures to

17 reduce the significant impacts to air quality and GHGs that the DEIR and FEIR

18 acknowledged would occur.

19 The City and its consultants apparently deliberately failed to give notice to

20 GSEJA of their issuance of the FEIR prior the Planning Commission's hearing on

21 the Project.

5.
22 In short, the City adopted a large-scale high-cube warehouse Project with

23 significant impacts without providing any mitigations or buffering to limit its impacts to

24 neighbors or the environment.

6.
25 Petitioner seeks to invalidate the following City Council actions on November 10,

26 2020 relating to and approving the Project:

a.
27 Resolution No. 2020- certifying the certifying the Environmental Impact

28 Report for the Project;

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 6

1
b. Resolution 2020- approving General Plan Amendment No. 19-007, to
2 approve the General Plan Land Use designation on approximately 33.6 acres from Residential
Planned Community (RP-C) and Walkable Mixed Use Corrdior and Downtown (WMXU-1) to
4 General Industrial (I-G);

C. Resolution 2020- to amend the General Plan Land Use designation on
6 approximately 13.8 acres from Single-Family Residential (R-SF) to Medium-Density Residential 7 (R-M);
8 d. Ordinance No. an Ordinance of the City Council of the City of Fontana,
9 approving Specific Plan Amendment No. 19-011, to modify the boundaries of the Southwest 10 Industrial Specific Plan (SWIP) to include and designate a Specific Plan zoning of Slover East 11 Industrial District (SED);
12
e. Ordinance No. an Ordinance of the City Council of the City of Fontana, 13 approving Zone Change No. 19-005, for 33.6 acres from Residential Planned Community (RP- 14 C) and Form Based Code (FBC) to Southwest Industrial Park Specific Plan (SWIP); 15 f. Ordinance No. an Ordinance of the City Council of the City of Fontana, 16 approving Zone Change No. 20-008 to change the zoning on approximately 13.8 acres from 17 Single-Family Residential (R-1) to Medium Density Residential (R-2); 18
g. Ordinance No. an Ordinance of the City Council of the City of Fontana, 19 approving Development Agreement No. 20-002, which provides a public benefit fee in the 20 amount of $3,206.234; and
21 h. Resolution 2020- a Resolution of the City Council of the City of Fontana 22 approving Tentative Parcel Map No. 20171 to reconfigure the existing parcels of approximately 23 33.6 acres into two parcels (2) parcels and approving Design Review No. 19-036 to construct 24 two (2) high cube warehouses totaling approximately 754,408 square feet. 25
II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
26
7. This Court has jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 27

28 1094.5. The Court has jurisdiction of CEQA matters pursuant to Pub. Resources Code sections

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 7

-

2 21168, 21168.5, and 21168.9.

8.
3 Venue is proper in this Court because the City of Fontana is within the

4 jurisdiction of this County and the Project is located in San Bernardino County as well, so the

5 actions giving rise to the causes of action herein transpired in San Bernardino County. See Code

6 of Civil Procedure sections 393 and 394.

9.
7 This action is timely filed within 30 days of the posting of the Notice of

8 Determination under CEQA on November 12, 2020.

10.
9 Petitioner has exhausted its administrative remedies by commenting on the

10 Project prior to the close of the public hearing on the Project before the filing of the dispositive

11 Notice of Determination, in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21177(b).

11.
12 The dispositive Notice of Determination is that which was filed after the matter

13 was approved by the ultimate land use authority, which in this case was the City of Fontana City

14 Council, filed November 12.

12.
15 Petitioner has complied with CEQA, Pub. Resources Code section 21167.5, by

16 filing and serving with this Petition for Writ of Mandate a Notice of Intent to File (a true and

17 correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A). Petitioner has complied with CEQA,

18 Pub. Resources Code section 21167.6, in notifying the City of Petitioner's election to prepare the

19 administrative record. Petitioner has complied with CEQA's requirement that Petitioner notify

20 the Attorney General of the commencement of this action pursuant to Pub. Resources Code

21 section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388; a copy of Petitioner's Notice to the

22 Attorney General will be filed along with the present Petition.

III. PARTIES
23
13.
24 Petitioner Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance ("GSEJA") is an

25 advocacy organization devoted to the preservation of the environment as well as the promotion

26 of safe and healthy communities. Constituents of GSEJA reside in San Bernardino County and

27 the surrounding area, and they would be irreparably harmed by the Project's environmental

28 impacts. GSEJA submitted comments on the Project. GSEJA brings this action on behalf of the

11
IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS AND COMMON ALLEGATIONS
12 A. Inadequate Alternatives Analysis and Implementation: No Reasonable Range of
13 Alternatives, and Failure to Implement the Reduced Density Alternative
14 1. No Reasonable Range of Alternatives.
15
25. CEQA requires that an EIR analyze a "reasonable range of potentially feasible
16 alternatives that will foster informed decisionmaking and public participation." CEQA
17 Guidelines ("Guidelines") § 15126.6(a). The alternatives Respondents chose did not represent a
18 reasonable range because all they did was consider two variants of the required "No Project"
19 Alternative, and then a Reduced Density Alternative. This means there was only one real
20 alternative considered, the Reduced Density Alternative. This does not represent a "reasonable
21 range" as required by the statute and Guidelines.
22
26. In the FEIR, Respondents argued that they had also considered an Alternative
23 Site and rejected it from further consideration, but Guidelines section 15126.6's requirement of a
24 reasonable range of alternatives is for the alternatives actually discussed in a DEIR, sO that the
25 public can comment upon those alternatives. And it appears that the only consideration given to
26 an alternative site was generic, without the actual identification of or consideration of an actual
27
alternative site.
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 10

2. Failure to Adopt the Reduced Density Alternative.
2
27.
3 The Sierra Club (San Gorgonio Chapter) correctly commented that under CEQA,
a lead agency is required to adopt a project if feasible mitigation measures or feasible 4
alternatives are available which would substantially lessen the project's significant
environmental effects. See, e.g., Pub. Res. Code § 21002. Since the Reduced Density 6
Alternative satisfied all of the Project's objectives, and reduced Air Quality impacts from NOx to 7

8 less than significant, and reduced GHG impacts somewhat, Respondents were required to adopt

it.
9 B. Inadequate Project Description
10
28. As the Petitioner and the Sierra Club also noted, under CEQA, a DEIR is to cover
11 a "project," which is supposed to be the "whole of an action" which will result in reasonably 12
foreseeable direct or indirect physical changes to the environment. Guidelines, § 15378(a). The 13

14 DEIR's Project Description was flawed because it did not address cold storage, which would

15 cause a number of trucks with transport refrigeration units ("TRUs") to visit the site. TRUs are
diesel-powered, and would result in significantly larger emissions of diesel particulate matter, a 16
known carcinogen. Respondents' Health Risk Assessment ("HRA") did not evaluate the 17
presence of any TRUs on the site. As the Sierra Club properly commented, if it is possible that 18

19 TRUs may be present on the site, the DEIR should have evaluated it, and the DEIR

20 acknowledged this as a possibility. As Petitioner noted, cold storage was permitted as of right in
as both Petitioner and the Sierra Club 21 the Southwest Industrial Park ("SWIP") Specific Plan, and
commented, the DEIR's failure to analyze the impacts from cold storage was deferred mitigation 22
in violation of CEQA.
23
29, The DEIR stated that an "amendment" would be required if the Project site was to 24
permit cold storage. But the Sierra Club commented that if the site is to prohibit TRUs unless 25

26 there is such an "amendment," the City had to condition its approval upon the absence of TRUs.

27 The City said it agreed, but the Exhibit to its Design Review and Tentative Parcel Map
Resolution was never posted by City staff, so it is impossible to determine whether the City 28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 11

1 actually did condition its approval on the absence of cold storage at the site.
2
30. The DEIR was also insufficient for failing to discuss Project grading and whether
3 any soil haul trips would be required to or from the Project site, as discussed with respect to Air
4
Quality, below.
5 C. Inadequacy of Analysis and Discussion: Air Quality, GHGs, Biological
6 Resources, Energy, and Land Use Impacts
7 1. Air Quality.
8
31. In Sierra Club v. County of Fresno (2018) 6 Cal. 5th 502, the California Supreme
9

10 Court made clear that an EIR must contain adequate discussion for a reviewer of the EIR to
meaningfully assess the reviewed project's impacts, not merely conclusory statements regarding
11

12 whether a project's impacts are significant or not. The DEIR in this case did not properly

13 analyze or discuss impacts to Air Quality in a number of respects, including but not limited to:
The DEIR failed to model the 498 parking spaces proposed in its CalEEMod'
14 analysis, and only modeled 404 spaces. While the City contended this was
15 adequate in the FEIR because it modeled construction impacts arguably
16 equivalent to those of the Project, it did not model operational impacts that were
17 equivalent to the presence of 498 spaces.
18 There was no substantiation for projected worker and vendor trip lengths related
19 to construction. While the City relied upon the default trip lengths for these items
20 in CalEEMod, it had no basis for doing so, and should have made assumptions
21 based on worker and vendor accessibility to South Fontana.
22 Petitioner pointed out that Respondents' consultant's fraction of time at home and
23 age bins were not in compliance with those for the SCAQMD's Permit
24 Application Package N. Respondents' consultants asserted that they had
25 complied with OEHHA's 2015 risk assessment Guidance, but Petitioners are
26 informed and believe that Permit Application Package N reflects OEHHA's
27

28 CalEEMod is an emissions calculation program offered by the
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 12

requirements, such that the City may not have complied with OEHHA's Guidance 2
on these subjects either. 3

4 The truck trip length was not adequately projected, such that violations of
SCAQMD's regional thresholds was likely underestimated, as Sierra Club pointed 5
out extensively in its comments. Respondents' reliance of SBTAM,2 when it 6

7 yielded numbers so vastly at odds with the fact that the Project is likely to have

8 trucks coming from the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach at roughly 65 miles
away, was a failure to proceed by law and was not based on substantial evidence. 9

10 As both Petitioner and the Sierra Club pointed out in different ways, the Project

11 should have been conditioned on no haul trips for import or export of soil since

none were modeled. There were no grading plans made available with the DEIR 12

13 (or, to Petitioner's knowledge, with the FEIR).

14 The DEIR analyzed construction equipment emissions as if the equipment would

15 be used a maximum of eight hours per day, although the City acknowledged that

16 its Municipal Code permitted construction 11 hours per day on weekdays, and

17 that crews would likely be constructing the Project during the entirety of that

18 period. CEQA requires the analysis of a project's worst-case scenario. The

19 City's analysis represented a failure to proceed by law and it was not based on
substantial evidence.
20
32. The DEIR's HRA also failed because it did not model construction-related health 21

22 risks to nearby sensitive receptors, despite CARB's demand to the City that the HRA do so.
2. GHGs.
23
33.
24 The DEIR's GHG Analysis was faulty in at least three respects.
34.
25 First, as noted in the Air Quality Analysis discussion above, the DEIR relied on
CalEEMod defaults and SBTAM predictions which were unwarranted based on actual conditions 26

27 on the ground in Fontana. By way of example only, as noted in the Air Quality Analysis

28 SBTAM is the San Bernardino Transportation Analysis Model, which is a program that was prepared by the San Bernardino Transportation Authority. PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 13

1 discussion above, the DEIR assumed an average truck trip length of 36 miles when most trucks
2 visiting the Project site are likely to be coming from or going to the Ports of Los Angeles and
3
Long Beach approximately 65 miles away.
4
35. Second, as the Sierra Club noted, the DEIR's comments that the Project "does not
5 directly interfere with" the State's goals to reduce GHGs statewide 40% by 2030 and 80% by
6 2050, as reflected in SB 32, Executive Order S-3-05, and the CARB 2017 Scoping Plan Update,
7 was fundamentally disingenuous. In Impact 4.7-2, the DEIR asserted it was analyzing whether
8 the Project would "Conflict with an applicable plan, policy, or regulation adopted for the purpose
9 of reducing the emissions of [GHGs]," as CEQA Guidelines Appendix G mandates. While the
10 DEIR acknowledged a significant impact under Impact 4.7-2, it purported to do so only "because
11

12 the project exceeds applicable numeric thresholds," DEIR at 4.7-29, and it claimed that the

13 Project was consistent with the 2017 Scoping Plan Update, SB 32 and Executive Order S-3-05.

14 These claims were entirely false under existing law, and the DEIR's discussion was inadequate

15 under Sierra Club v. County of Fresno, supra.

36. Third, as the Sierra Club pointed out, the Project was inconsistent with CARB's
16

17 Scoping Plans'* actions to deploy zero emission freight vehicles, to support "Last Mile Delivery,"

18 and to provide electric vehicle ("EV") charging.
3. Biological Resources.
19
37. The DEIR completely failed to adequately assess impacts to the BUOW, a
20

21 California species of special concern which is rapidly losing habitat and rapidly declining in

22 prevalence in the State. As Petitioner commented, the City's consultants failed to conduct a

23 proper BUOW assessment or survey in compliance with the California Department of Fish &
Wildlife's 2012 Staff Report on Burrowing Owl Mitigation. Among other things, the Staff
24

25 Report, which sets the standard for BUOW assessments pursuant to CEQA in California, calls

26 for four survey visits at specified intervals in different seasons, and provides for the issuance of a
survey report that the public can view. Respondents' consultants only made one site visit, and
27

28 the City did not issue any sort of survey report.

2 4. Energy.

38.
3 CEQA Guidelines Appendix F, which implements Pub. Res. Code section

4 21100(b)(3), substantively requires that EIRs demonstrate, and that Projects represent, the "wise

5 and efficient" use of energy. Appendix F indicates that this goal may be achieved by decreasing

6 overall energy consumption, decreasing fossil fuel consumption, and increasing reliance on

7 renewable energy. The DEIR failed to implement any of these measures, and merely relied on

8 the Project's compliance with 6 Title 24 Parts 6 and 11. At least two cases have found that
compliance with Title 24 is not enough to demonstrate compliance with CEQA's energy

10 mandates: Ukiah Citizens for Safety First v. City of Ukiah (2016) 248 Cal. App. 4th 256, and

11 Cal. Clean Energy Comm. v. City of Woodland (2014) 225 Cal. App. 4th 173. The City's

12 consultants disregarded the guidance in these cases both in their discussion of energy impacts,

13 addressed here, and in their failure to impose any mitigation measures, addressed below.

14 5. Land Use Impacts.

15 39. The DEIR purported to analyze the Project's consistency with a variety of

16 pertinent land use plans including SB 330, the City's General Plan, and the Southern California

17 Association of Governments' ("SCAG's") 2016/2040 Regional Transportation Plan/Sustainable

18 Communities Strategy ("RTP/SCS"). The DEIR's analysis was self-serving and disingenuous

19 again with respect to a variety of the policies in all three, as specified in great detail by both

20 Petitioner and the Sierra Club, and the City's discussion was not adequate in compliance with

21 Sierra Club v. City of Fresno.

40.
22 By way of example only,

23 The DEIR understated the potential number of housing units to be lost on the site,

24 which the Project proposed to replace through the "upzoning" of a separate

25 parcel. This violated SB 330.

26 The DEIR claimed the Project was consistent with Goal 1, Policy 3 of Chapter 6

27 of the General Plan, "Building a Healthier Fontana." The intent of the stated

28 Policy was to improve air quality and to actively discourage development that
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 15

- may
N m t n 0 exacerbate asthma rates. When Petitioner pointed out that the DEIR
recognized that Project would have significant operational impacts with respect to
SCAQMD's regional threshold for NOx, which is an ozone (smog) precursor,
which precipitates and exacerbates asthma, and would have significant
operational impacts due to inconsistency with the applicable Air Quality

7 Management Plan, Respondents altered that discussion in the FEIR, but failed to
recirculate it. The new discussion claimed that the Project was "Partially
8 Consistent" with this Policy, because supposedly "Implementation of the project
9 would not impede the City of Fontana from supporting local and regional
10 initiatives to improve air quality in order to reduce asthma." However, the Project 11 itself is bound to impede Air Quality and to exacerbate asthma, and the City's 12 statement was less than transparent.
13 The Project is inconsistent with the City's General Plan Chapter 9, Goal 2, Policy
14

15 2 to support designated truck routes that avoid negative impacts on residential
areas because the Project will not use designated truck routes.
16 The Project conflicts with General Plan Chapter 12 Goal 4 because it will lead to
17 significant and unavoidable GHG impacts, whereas the Goal states "Fontana
18 meets the greenhouse gas reduction goals for 2030." Although the City argued
19 that there are no relevant policies implementing this Goal, the Project is broadly
20 inconsistent with the Goal, the and the City imposed no GHG mitigation
21
measures.
22 The Project derogates from the General Plan Land Use Element's Goal 5, Actions
23 A and B, which called for directing new industrial development to the existing
24 SWIP and as disclosed in a Future Land Use Map. Instead of directing
25

26 development to the existing SWIP, the City chose with its General Plan
Amendments to expand the SWIP, to the detriment of surrounding residential 27
areas. The City argued that it was not "carving out" a residential area to become
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 16

-
industrial, but that is precisely what it did do.
2
The Project is inconsistent with the RTP/SCS because contrary to that document's m7 a 0Nc call to provide "Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment in public parking lots,' the
Project will have none. Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment - EVSE - means
electric vehicle chargers, and the Project provides for zero.3
The Project is further inconsistent with RTP/SCS Goals 2, 4, and 5, which are to
maximize mobility and accessibility in the region, create a sustainable regional
transportation system, and maximize productivity of the transportation system,
because the Project was found to have significant and unavoidable transportation 10
impacts in terms of vehicle miles traveled ("VMT"). 11
The Project is finally inconsistent with RTP/SCS Goal 6 to protect the 12
environmental health of all residents by improving air quality.4 13 D. Inadequate Cumulative Impacts and Growth Inducing Impacts Analysis
14
41. Petitioner commented that the DEIR was insufficient for failure to address the
15 cumulative impacts of other warehouse projects involving General Plan Amendments such as the
16 Goodman Logistics Center III project, located quite close to the instant Project. Cumulative
17 impacts were inadequately assessed with respect to, among other things, population and housing.
18 The City's consultants asserted that they did not have to analyze cumulative impacts for impacts
determined not to be significant. This conclusion was incorrect under both the CEQA statutes 19

20 and the Guidelines.
21 42. The DEIR further asserted that the Project would have no growth-inducing
22 impacts because the Project entitlements, including General Plan Amendments, a Specific Plan, 23 and other actions, were actions "commonly undertaken on a regular basis by many jurisdictions,"
24

25 3 The FEIR in one place states that 20 electric car chargers will be installed, but Petitioner has been entirely unable to verify that the City imposed a condition of approval requiring car 26 chargers, and the Title 24 2019 CALGreen Code section to which Respondent cites in the FEIR does not require chargers, but only conduit for future EVSE. 27 4 The Project is inconsistent with the RTP/SCS for the reasons identified in the last three bullet
28 points, and the City's statement that the Project was "encouraged by the RTP/SCS to reduce VMT and expand multimodal transportation options" was entirely without support. PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 17

1 such that they were not "precedent-setting." The City's assertions were incorrect; there was no
2 substantial evidence in support of its conclusions, and the assumptions it made in choosing not to
3 assess growth-inducing impacts represented a failure to proceed by law.
4
43. As Petitioner pointed out, the City a is a general-law city limited to four General
5 Plan Amendments per year under Government Code section 65358, the City's actions with
6 respect to the Project did set a precedent, and even if they did not, they could be growth-inducing
7 in and of themselves: the Project proposes both the future development of new homes and the
8 present development of businesses.
9 E. Failure to Adopt All Feasible Mitigation
10
44. CEQA requires that lead agencies adopt all feasible mitigations for significant
11 environmental impacts, regardless of whether the lead agency has adopted a "statement of
12

13 overriding considerations." Respondents failed to do this in a host of ways with respect to Air
Quality, GHGs, and Energy.
14
45.: Respondents failed to adopt the following mitigations or alternatives specifically
15

16 identified by commenters:
Respondents refused to even consider adopting the Reduced Density Alternative 17

18 although it was feasible and achieved all the Project's stated objectives.
Respondents rejected measures to install solar panels on the buildings, to provide
19 for EV charging as opposed to EV parking spaces for cars, and to provide conduit 20 for zero-emission truck charging at the loading docks or anywhere else.
21

22 Respondents refused to require that light- and medium-duty or last-mile delivery

23 trucks and vans visiting the site be zero-emission, or to phase in heavy duty zero-
emission trucks onsite. They could have required such measures by conditioning
24 the Project on the Applicant including these items in tenant leases. 25

26 Respondents failed to require zero-emission forklifts, yard trucks, or other service
equipment.
27 Respondents refused to consider requiring that trucks visiting the site be required
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 18

- to be model year 2010 or later or to require that any trucks with TRUs plug in to 2
electrical power upon arriving at the site. 3
46. In the FEIR, Respondents purported to adopt mitigation measures AQ-3 through 4
AQ-7, but these measures were insufficient. Among other it things, it appears that requiring 5
tenants to be notified of the availability of Carl Moyer Program truck funding is already 6
necessary under state law, and AQ-4, labeled "Providing Electric Interior Vehicles," only 7
required that hookups be required, and AQ-5, requiring a Transportation Management
8
Association, is already mandated by Title 24 Part 11, and AQ-6, requiring signs directing trucks
to designated truck routes, would only reduce PM pollution and not the NOx pollution that the 10
Project would generate in significant quantities. 11
47. There was no substantial evidence justifying the omission of the many mitigation 12

13 measures recommended by commenters that would have significantly reduced Air Quality,
GHG, and Energy impacts, and the City's failure to implement them was a failure to proceed by 14
law.
15
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
16 Recirculation of the DEIR
17 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000 et seq.]
18
48. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1-47 as if set forth in full.
19
49. A DEIR must be recirculated if there is the addition of significant new
20 information after public notice is given or if the DEIR. is so fundamentally and basically
21 inadequate that meaningful public review and comment were precluded. Here, as alleged above,
22
the DEIR was fundamentally and basically inadequate in that, among other things, it:
23 Newly acknowledged General Plan inconsistencies, though it refused to find significant
24 land use and planning impacts.
25 Claimed that the Project would require EV charging, as opposed to merely EV charging
26 infrastructure, when there was no support for those claims in the record. 27 Failed to include all relevant information regarding GHGs.
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 19

These comments were raised by Petitioner and others before the agency acted upon the Project.
2
50. Recirculation is also required where the drafters of the EIR are confronted with
3 significant new information after public notice is given on the DEIR.
4
51. Recirculation of an EIR requires notice pursuant to Guidelines section 15087 and
5 consultation pursuant to Guidelines section 15086. Notice under section 15087 means the
6 agency must provide for a new review period and include a list of significant effects anticipated
7 from the project. Consultation means that the agency must request comment from responsible
8 agencies and trustee agencies as well as any other state, federal or local agencies with
9 jurisdiction over any resource which may be impacted by the Project.
10
52. There was significant information omitted from the DEIR on the issues identified
11 above and others, and Respondents failed to require recirculation.
12 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
13 Failure to Analyze All Potentially Significant Impacts/Inadeguacy of Discussion
14 CEQA, Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000 et seq.l
15 53. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 52 as if fully set
16 forth.
17 54. The DEIR failed to assess significant impacts with respect to, and/or contained
18 inadequate discussion as indicated in the preceding paragraphs and otherwise with respect to:
19 Air Quality
20 GHGs;
21 Biological Resources,
22 Land Use and Planning, and
23
Energy.
24
55. The EIR's conclusions were not based on substantial evidence and represented a
25 failure to adequately disclose impacts, and Respondents' process in reviewing these impacts
26 represented a failure to proceed by law.

2 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

3 Failure to Include All Critical Information in the DEIR

4 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq.]

56.
5 forth. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 55 as if fully set

6
57.
7 The DEIR failed to include critical information in the DEIR itself, burying key

8 elements in Appendices, in violation of established precedent, and in violation of CEQA.

9 Among other things and by way of example only, the DEIR failed to provide any support for the

10 assertion that the Project would provide EV charging stations for cars.

11 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

12 Failure to Adequately Mitigate All Potentially Significant Impacts

13 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000 et seq.l

58.
14 forth. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 57 as if fully set

15
59.
16 CEQA requires an agency to adopt feasible mitigation measures that will

17 substantially lessen or avoid the project's potentially significant impacts and to describe those

18 mitigation measures in the DEIR. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21081(a), 21100(b)(3); Guidelines

19 15126.4. A lead agency may not conclude that an impact is significant and unavoidable

20 without requiring the imposition of all feasible mitigation measures to reduce impacts to less

21 than significant levels. Guidelines §§ 15126.4, 15091.

60.
22 The DEIR failed to adequately mitigate for multiple impacts, including as to Air

23 Quality, GHGs, Land Use and Planning, and Energy.

24 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

25 Inadequate Statement of Overriding Considerations

26 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq.]

61.
27 forth. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 60 as if fully set

28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 21

- 62.
2 CEQA requires that an agency must adopt a "statement of overriding

3 considerations" for any significant effects which have not been mitigated to a level of

4 insignificance by mitigation measures or the adoption of alternatives. The agency must find

5 "that specific overriding economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits of the project

6 outweigh the significant effects on the environment." Pub. Res. Code § 21081(b).

63.
7 The statement of overriding considerations must be based on substantial evidence

8 in the record. Pub. Res. Code § 21081.5; Guidelines § 15093(b).

64.
9 Here Respondents' statement of overriding considerations was not based on

10 substantial evidence.

11 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

12 Inadequate Project Description

13 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq.]

65.
14
forth. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 64 as if fully set

15
66.
16 CEQA requires a finite and stable Project Description in an EIR.

67.
17 The EIR failed to adequately describe this Project, among other things failing to

18 acknowledge that it anticipated the potential use of cold storage, and failing to analyze the

19 impacts of such cold storage, which was deferred mitigation.

20 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

21 Inadequate Alternatives Analvsis

22 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq.]

68.
23 forth. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 67 as if fully set

24 69.
25 Respondents failed to properly select or analyze alternatives for the Project in the

26 DEIR because they:

27 Failed to assess or impose alternatives that could lessen the impacts of the Project;

28 Failed to assess a reasonable range of alternatives.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 22

F
70. The failure to adequately analyze alternatives violated CEQA's informational
2
purposes.
3
WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays
4
1. For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring Respondents to set aside 5
their decision certifying the EIR for the Project (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 6 21168.5, 21168.9, Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085, 1094.5), 7
2. For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring Respondents to fully 8 comply with the requirements of CEQA prior to any future approval of the Project 9 (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5, 21168.9, Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085, 10
1094.5),
11
3. For a judgment enforcing the duty imposed upon Respondents by CEQA to 12 adequately address potential individual and cumulative impacts to the 13 environment in any subsequent action taken regarding the Project, 14
4. For a judgment enforcing the duty imposed upon Respondents by CEQA to 15 adequately consider mitigation and alternatives to reduce significant impacts in 16 any subsequent action taken to approve the Project, 17
5. For a judgment requiring Respondents to prepare, circulate and consider a new 18 and legally adequate Environmental Impact Report and otherwise comply with 19 CEQA in any subsequent action taken to approve this Project, 20
6. For a judgment invalidating Respondents' approvals in connection with the 21
proposed Project;
22
7. For costs of suit, including attorney's fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure 23 1021.5 and other provisions of law; and 24
