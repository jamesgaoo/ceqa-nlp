I. INTRODUCTION 21

22 1. This is a lawsuit to enforce important rights and protections under the California
23 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000 et seq.; 14 Cal Code Regs.
24 [hereinafter "Guidelines"] §§ 15000 et seq.)

25 2. Compliance by public agencies with the procedural and substantive requirements
26 of CEQA is essential to maintenance of CEQA's important public purpose of providing public
27 agencies and the public with detailed information about the effects which a proposed project is
28 likely to have on the environment.

-1-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 3. For this reason, CEQA requires full compliance with its procedural and
2 substantive requirements, since that is the only way to ensure the important public purposes of
3 CEQA are protected from subversion.
4 4. South Feather Water and Power Agency ("Agency") requested CEQA notices
5 from Respondent North Yuba Water District ("NYWD"), including notices of exemption,
G pursuant to California Public Resources Code section 21092.2, which requires that agencies
7 provide copies of CEQA notices and determinations to any person who has filed a written
8
MINASIAN, MEITH, SOARES, SEXTON & COOPER, LLP requests for notices with the agency. NYWD, despite the Agency's request, failed to provide the
9 Agency notice of its CEQA actions.
10 5. NYWD has subverted CEQA's vital procedural requirements by adopting,
11
tans pug SPREO Y ROR 1OOKO without advance notice to the Agency, the Oroleve Ditch Pipeline Project (*Pipeline Project").
12 6. NYWD has also violated the procedural and substantive provisions of CEQA by
13
38 (530) 533-2885 adopting and implementing a project without first undertaking environmental analysis required
14

15 by CEQA and, instead, purported to adopt the project under a CEQA exemption.
7. NYWD's failure to comply with the procedural and substantive requirements of
16 CEQA has prejudiced the Agency. Agency has not had access to the environmental analysis
17 required by law to fully assess potential environmental impacts including, without limitation,
18

19 water supply and groundwater impacts from the Pipeline Project, and NYWD's violations have
deprived the Agency and the public of the full opportunity to assess the Pipeline Project and to
20 offer comments, including alternatives and environmental mitigation measures, as required by
21 CEQA.
22 Il. PARTIES
23 8. Petitioner South Feather Water & Power Agency, located in Plumas and Butte
24 Counties, California, is a local public agency irrigation district formed and existing under
25 Division 11 of the California Water Code.
26 9. Respondent NYWD is, and at all times mentioned herein was, a local public
27 agency water district formed and existing under Division 13 of the California Water Code

10. Respondents NYWD Board Members Doug Neilson, Fred Mitchell, Gary
2 Hawthorne, Gretchen Flohr, and Eric Hansard are named in their official capacities as board 3 members and decisionmakers ofNYWD.
4
11. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Respondents sued herein 5 as Does 1 through 20, inclusive, and therefore sue these parties by such fictitious names.
6 Petitioner will amend this writ to allege their true names and capacities when these are
alleges that each of the fictitiously 7 ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believe and thereon
8
d11 8dOOD 9 NOLXES 'SIUVOS 'HLEW 'NVISYNIN named respondents are responsible in some manner for the occurrences herein alleged, and that 9 Petitioner's injuries and damages as herein alleged were proximately caused by the conduct of 10 such fictitiously named respondents.

III, EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES 09696 12 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW 0 6291 x0gO'd 1681 Bird Street SRSZ-EEG (OES) 9IAOIC 13 12. To the extent NYWD undertook any administrative process allowing the Agency
14 to present the issues raised in this Petition prior to approving and carrying out the Pipeline
15 Project, Petitioner did so. Thus Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies.
16 Additionally, Petitioner contends that, because NYWD failed to comply with CEQA's
17 procedural mandates by providing advance notice of its alleged exemption determination, there
18 was no opportunity to raise objections and thus no obligation to exhaust administrative remedies.
19 13. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
20 unless this court grants the requested writ of mandate. In the absence of such remedies,
21 Respondents' approval of the Pipeline Project will proceed in violation of state law.
22 IV. STATUTORY NOTICE
23 14. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 by filing a
24 copy of this Petition with the California Attorney General. A copy of that notice and a proof of
service were filed concurrently with this Petition and as attached as Exhibit A and incorporated 25

Project pursuant to subdivision (d) of Public Resources Code section 21167.
15 VI. PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL
16 20. This proceeding involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public
17 interest. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer substantial benefit on the
18

19 public, including citizens, residents, businesses, and taxpayers of the Agency and the State of

20 California, and will result in the enforcement of important public rights by requiring

21 Respondents to comply with CEQA and other legal requirements applicable to the Pipeline
Project, by voiding project approval, and by prohibiting Respondents from taking further action 22

23 with respect to implementation of the Project until they have complied with legal requirements.
21,
24 Petitioner brings this action as private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil

25 Procedure section 1021.5. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement of these public
rights entitle Petitioner to an award of reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to that section.

1 VII. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
Forbestown Ditch 2

3 22. NYWD and Agency are neighboring water providers that share important water
4 distribution infrastructure known as the Forbestown Ditch. The Forbestown Ditch is an earthen
5 ditch in excess of approximately ten miles in length and that was originally constructed in the
6
1800s.
7 23. Pursuant to a 2005 Agreement between Agency and NYWD, the Upper
8
2 d'T1 NEJOOD  NOLXIS 'SSUVOS'HLIEN 'NVISYNIN Forbestown Ditch is owned, operated and maintained by NYWD. A component of the Upper
9 Forbestown Ditch, as defined in the 2005 Agreement, is the Oroleve Ditch. The Lower
10 Forbestown Ditch is owned, operated and maintained by Agency. The dividing point between the
11
S96S6 ' 629L § Ee a o Upper and Lower Forbestown Ditch is a measuring point known as WD-6. A depiction of the
12 Forbestown Ditch is attached as Exhibit D and incorporated herein by this reference.
13 24. Despite the Upper Forbestown Ditch being owned and operated by NYWD, it
14 remains a vital piece of infrastructure to the Agency. Agency customers continue to be served 15 directly from the Upper Forbestown Ditch and NYWD is required to deliver up to 11 cfs of 16 water at WD-6 for use by Agency and its customers served from the Lower Forbestown Ditch.
17 Any act or omission of NYWD that compromises the supply and delivery of surface water 18 through the Upper Forbestown Ditch has the potential to adversely impact Agency, its
19 customers, and the environment.
20 25. Oroleve Creek is a tributary to the South Fork of the Feather River, upstream of
21 reservoirs, powerhouses, and other water facilities owned and maintained by Agency.
22 26. NYWD utilizes Oroleve Creek as a source of water supply to the Upper
23 Forbestown Ditch, and a point of diversion from the Oroleve Creek carries Oroleve water
24 through an earthen ditch that is part of the Upper Forbestown Ditch, but for purposes of this writ 25 is described as the Oroleve Ditch.

1 NYWD's Forbestown Ditch Pipeline Project
2
27. Since approximately 2010, NYWD has been exploring efforts to modify the 3 Upper Forbestown Ditch, including the potential of installing a pipeline in the ditch. The project 4 at all times consisted of piping the entire Forbestown Ditch, including the Oroleve Ditch.
5 28. Agency has monitored NYWD's progress and offered to assist NYWD with
6 maintenance activities due to Agency's interest in the Upper Forbestown Ditch and its
7 continuing importance in Agency's ability to deliver water to Agency customers.
8
29. In approximately 2017 and 2020 NYWD received grant funding to study the 9 feasibility of improving water efficiency in the Upper Forbestown Ditch. 10 30. In September 2019 NYWD published in its newsletter to customers that it
11
59656 received a $500,000.00 planning grant from the State of California to cover the engineering
12
88 S99Z-gES (0ES) & 189 Bird Siecet DILLAOIC d'11 23d000 y NOLXaS SANVOS HLIEW 'NVISVNIN phase of the Forbestown Ditch Pipeline Project and stated "this phase is almost complete" and 13 "Next up is the construction phase."
14 31. a component of the larger Forbestown Project Improvements to Oroleve Ditch are
15 that NYWD represents is intended to convert the entire Forbestown Ditch, which is currently an 16 open earthen ditch, to a closed pipeline. 17
32. On June 26, 2020 NYWD sent a letter to Yuba Water Agency, a true and correct 18 copy of which is attached as Exhibit E. incorporated herein by this reference. The letter begins, 19

20 Over the last three years, the Yuba Water Agency (YWA) POD Committee and the Board of Directions have consistently supported our North Yuba Water
21 District (NYWD) effort to complete the Forbestown Ditch Piping Project (the Project). Thank you for helping us provide a reliable, safe source of drinking 22 water for the approximately 3,100 customers of NYWD.
23 (Underlining Added.)
24 Piping the Upper Forbestown Ditch was always envisioned, pursued, and advocated by NYWD
25 as a single, integrated project that included Oroleve Ditch Pipeline improvements as well. For
26 example, NYWD's request for funding from YWA states,
27 We are now the next milestone in the Project, construction of approximately one 28 mile. we are calling the Oroleve Ditch section. During your June 16, 2020. POD meeting, NorthStar Engineering gave formal presentation of the project.

m (Underlining Added.)

2 The Pipeline Project was and is an integral component of the larger project being pursued by
3 NYWD - the piping of the Upper Forbestown Ditch:

4 To recap the need for the Project, moving to a piped Forbestown Ditch will allows
5 us to significantly lower the possibility of catastrophic breaches to the Ditch. In addition, as water moves through the unpiped Ditch up to 60% is lost due to 6 seepage and evaporation, and contamination occurs from dirt, trash, metals and
7 illegal marijuana grows. Piping the Ditch would vastly improve, if not completely resolve, these issues. Piping the Ditch will also help secure our water right by
8 satisfying the State requirements the water is being put to beneficial use and SEXTON & COOPER, LLP curtailing losses.

10 (Underlining Added.)

11 Agency's Request for CEQA Notices
§ Street 12 33. On October 29, 2019 Agency requested that NYWD provide it with CEQA
18 99556 VD MITAOIO 13 notifications pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21092.2 and Guidelines section 15082.
3 & S88C-EES (0gS) 14 Agency made this request for notice after it appeared NYWD was finally progressing on its

15 Forbestown Ditch Piping Project, which could impact Agency and its customers, as alleged

16 herein. A copy of this request is attached hereto as Exhibit F and incorporated herein by

17 reference.

18 34. California Public Resources Code section 21092.2 and Guidelines section 15082

19 require notices of all CEQA documents and determinations, including without limitation CEQA

20 notices of exemption, and these authorities require that notice be given to organizations or

21 individuals who have requested the notices, like the Agency.

22 35. To date, NYWD has not provided Petitioner the notices requested by Petitioner

23 and required by law notwithstanding Petitioner's requests and despite NYWD having undertaken

24 qualifying CEQA actions.

25 NYWD's Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Forbestown Ditch Project

26 - Done without Notice to Agency in Violation of CEQA

27 36. On or about August 3, 2020 Agency learned that NYWD prepared an Initial

28 Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration under CEQA for the Upper Forbestown Ditch Project with
a comment period ending on or about July 22, 2020.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1
37. Agency was not provided with a notice of this proposed action from NYWD, 2 notwithstanding Agency's October 2019 request for such notice. 3 38. NYWD's counsel responded to Agency's inquiry on August 3, 2020 by stating 4 that the "District did not finalize that CEQA document" and, instead, "is working on a full EIR 5 for the forbestown ditch project." A copy of correspondence between representatives of Agency 6 and NYWD are attached hereto as Exhibit G and incorporated herein.
7 NYWD's Purported Exemption for the Oroleve Ditch Pipe Proiect - Done Without Notice to
8
Agency In Violation of CEQA MINASIAN, MEITH, SOARES, SEXTON & COOPER, LLP 9 39. In February of 2021, Agency learned that NYWD adopted the Pipeline Project 10 under a purported notice of exemption. Agency representatives subsequently sent a letter to 11
pJ8 189L 100.45 NYWD's general counsel questioning the CEQA action, a copy of which is attached hereto as 6291 S9696 VD 193801C 12
Z-ESS (OES) Exhibit H and incorporated herein by this reference. On February 18, 2020 NYWD's general 8 13
0'd counsel responded "Please see attached NOE", with the referenced "NOE" referring to a notice 14 of exemption. The purported notice of exemption was signed by NYWD's general manager Jeff 15 Maupin, on January 14, 2020 - less than three months after Agency's request to NYWD for 16 CEQA notices. A true and correct copy of that notice is attached and incorporated herein as 17 Exhibit C.
18 40. Agency was not provided notice of NYWD's purported January 14, 2020 notice 19 of exemption until after Agency sent the February 2021 letter attached as Exhibit H questioning 20 the basis for moving forward with a CEQA project without having notified the Agency. 21 41. Thereafter, on March 9, 2021 the notice of exemption was received and posted by 22 the CEQA State Clearinghouse, thus starting the 35 day period for filing petition under Public 23 Resources Code § 21167(d). The document description provided by NYWD to the State 24 Clearinghouse states:
25

26 The project involves an existing facility that is used to deliver water to the Forbestown Treatment Plant where it is treated and utilized as drinking water by
27 residents within the water district's service area. Additionally, the project involves the replacement of an existing utility system with one that involves negligible or 28 no expansion of capacity. The piping of the Oroleve Ditch will not expand the existing capacity of the ditch, it will instead reduce water loss from the existing
-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- open channel. The project involves the placement of a 36-inch HDPE pipe within
2 the existing ditch alignment and will serve the same purpose as the existing ditch. The existing ditch moves water from the Oroleve Ditch headworks located on
3 Oroleve Creek to the Forbestown Ditch at the Oroleve Siphon, the new piped ditch will serve the exact same purpose. 4 The description is contrary and contradictory to prior statements about the purpose and need for 5 the Pipeline Project, including to increase conveyance capacity due to "up to 60%" water loss 6 due to ditch seepage. (Compare NYWD Project Description with Exh. E.) 7
42. NYWD violated CEQA by not timely providing its January 14, 2020 notice of 8 exemption to Agency pursuant to Agency's prior request for notices.
Construction of Oroleve Project
10 43. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that construction of the 11

E & ONDEI.BoE, 1 61365 6491 Oroleve Pipeline Project is nearing completion. S8SZ-EES (ocs) 12
44. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that NYWD's violation of 13 California Public Resources Code section 21092.2 and Guidelines, section 15082 by failing to 14

15 provide Agency notice of its CEQA actions and determinations notwithstanding Agency's prior

16 requests bars the application of any limitations period to an action of Agency challenging the

17 Oroleve Pipeline Project or NYWD's determinations or actions relating to the Pipeline Project,

18 including without limitation the one hundred and eighty (180) day limitations period of Public
Resources Code section 21167, subds (a),(d) and CEQA Guidelines section 15112, subd. (c)(5), 19 or the thirty-five (35) day limitations period of Public Resources Code section 21167, subd. (d) 20 and CEQA Guidelines 15112, subd. (c)(2).
21 45. Agency submitted a request to NYWD for notice of all CEQA determinations and 22 notifications pursuant to California Public Resources Code section 21092.2 and Guidelines
23

24 section 15082, and Agency reasonably relied on this submission and NYWD's legal obligation to
comply with the request and legal authorities and to provide Agency with copies of all CEQA 25 determinations and notices. Agency reasonably concluded that NYWD had not undertaken any 26 CEQA actions or determinations because Agency was not notified of any such actions or 27 determinations notwithstanding Agency's request to NYWD for notice of such actions and 28 NYWD's legal obligation to provide such notice. NYWD's failure to provide Agency notice as

-9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 required by law has prejudiced Agency who reasonably concluded that NYWD had not made or
2 undertaken any CEQA actions or determinations.
3 46. This action was prepared and commenced promptly by Agency after learning that 4 NYWD had disregarded Agency's request for notices and was proceeding a with a component of 5 the larger Forbestown Ditch Project, the Oroleve Pipeline Project, without complying with 6 CEQA.
7
47. CEQA does not authorize public agencies to disregard requests for notices 8
'SNVOS 'HLIEWN 'NVISYNIN NOIXES COOPER, LLP pursuant to California Public Resources Code section 21092.2 and Guidelines section 15082 and
9

10 to proceed with CEQA actions or determinations without providing notice as required by law,

11 and to then assert CEQA limitations periods as a defense to claims brought by those parties who
S9656 o 649t ã 12 requested but did not receive the notice required by law, as has occurred in this case.
48. On March 9, 2021, a Notice of Exemption by NYWD for the Oroleve Project was
Oroville, 13

14 posted on the State Clearinghouse website. A copy of the March 9, 2021 posting is attached

15 hereto as Exhibit I. This action is timely brought within thirty-five (35) days of that filing.
49.
16 Given the procedural violations of CEQA by NYWD and NYWD's continuing

17 failure to provide Agency notice of its actions and determinations in relation to CEQA, Agency
was not afforded the opportunity to submit pre-adoption comments to NYWD's Notice of
18

19 Exemption for the Oroleve Project contesting NYWD's reliance on the use of a CEQA
exemption to convert approximately one mile of open ditch to a pipeline. 20 50.
21 Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that NYWD's reliance on

22 a notice of exemption for the Oroleve Pipeline Project is contrary to law and violates CEQA. The

23 Oroleve Project is proposed to convert approximately one mile of open ditch to a pipeline, and

24 Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges this will proximately cause significant

25 impacts to the environment which require full analysis in an environmental impact report

26 pursuant to CEQA. The Oroleve Project's conversion of earthen ditch to pipeline will likely

27 eliminate a substantial source of seepage and groundwater recharge in the areas of the Pipeline

28 Project, and the Pipeline Project has the potential to interrupt and adversely impact the water
supply of Agency's customers who rely on the Forbestown Ditch for the delivery and supply of
-10-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

their water. The elimination of scepage and groundwater recharge resulting from the conversion 2 of earthen ditch to a pipeline also has the potential to adversely impact species that rely on such 3 water for survival, and on groundwater wells in the area that pump water from aquifers that the

as 4 seepage and groundwater recharge from the unlined canal contribute to. Moreover, the 5 installation of a pipeline may exacerbate wildfire risk in an area already very highly susceptible 6 to wildfire due to the flammable nature of the HDPE pipe that NYWD is proposing to install 7

4 63.

2 Petitioner is informed and believe and thereon alleges that NYWD has violated

3 CEQA and acted unlawfully by relying on a notice of exemption for the Oroleve Pipeline Project

4 and by proceeding with the Oroleve Pipeline Project without an environmental impact report as

5 required by CEQA. Petitioner is informed and believe and thereon alleges that the Oroleve

6 Pipeline Project, like the broader Forbestown Ditch Project, does not qualify for an exemption

7 under CEQA and that NYWD has acted unlawfully by relying on exemptions to proceed with the

MINASIAN, METTH, SOARES, SEXTON. TTEJOOD project without having compiled and certified an environmental impact report.
64.

9 NYWD has asserted Guidelines sections 15301(b) and 15302(c) in support of the

10 notice of exemption for the Oroleve Pipeline Project; however Petitioner is informed and

E 8 § S Streel 6491 11 believes and thereon alleges that the Oroleve Pipeline Project exceeds the scope of the

9sc-eeg (ocs) 12 exemptions relied on by NYWD under sections 15301(b) and 15302(c) for existing facilities and
replacement and reconstruction.

13 65.

14 Guidelines section 15302 subdivision (c) is limited to the "Replacement or

15

16 reconstruction of existing utility systems and/or facilities involving negligible or no expansion of
capacity." and section 15301 applies to "the operation, repair, maintenance ... or minor alteration

17 of existing public or private structures . +.4 involving negligible or no expansion of existing or
former use" and subdivision (b) applies the exemption to "Existing facilities of both investor and
18 publicly-owned utilities used to provide electric power, natural gas, sewerage, or other public
19 utility services"

20 66.

21 Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the exemptions

22 asserted by NYWD do not apply to the Oroleve Pipeline Project and that the Oroleve Pipeline

23 Project exceeds the scope of the asserted exemptions. Petitioner is informed and believes and

24 thereon alleges that NYWD has acted in violation of CEQA by improperly relying on CEQA

25 exemptions in relation to the Oroleve Pipeline Project. The pipeline project is a CEQA project

26 requiring analysis as such pursuant to CEQA.

forth hereafter.

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

2 WRIT OF MANDATE- IMPROPER PIECEMEALING OF A SINGLE PROJECT

3 67, Petitioner hereby incorporate by reference the allegations set forth above as

4 though fully set forth herein.

5 68. "A project under CEQA is the whole of an action which has a potential for a

6 resulting in a physical change in the environment, directly or ultimately, and includes the activity
7 which is being approved and which may be subject to several discretionary approvals by
8
MINASIAN, MEITH, SOARES, SEXTON & COOPER, LLP governmental agencies." (Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority v. Hensler (1991) 233
9 Cal.App.3d 577, 592.) CEQA prohibits piecemealing of projects and requires that a lead agency
10 analyze the entire project in a single environmental document.
11 69. CEQA prohibits piecemealing and segmenting a single project by splitting it into 1681 Bird Street à 99656 S8SZ-EES (0€9) 12 two or more segments in order to ensure that "that environmental considerations do not become
8 PIEAOJO 13 submerged by chopping a large project into many little ones, each with a potential impact on the 8 14 environment, which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences." (Glendale-Pasadena
15 Airport Authority v. Hensler (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 577, 592.)
16 70. NYWD has violated CEQA by unlawfully segmenting the Forbestown Ditch
17 Project for CEQA purposes and that the Oroleve Pipeline Project is only a component part of a
18 single, broader Forbestown Ditch Project in which the entire Forbestown Ditch is planned to be
19 converted from an open earthen ditch to a closed pipeline. Petitioner is informed and believes
20 and thereon alleges that NYWD has violated CEQA by proceeding with the Forbestown Ditch
21 Project on a piecemeal basis and and without having complied with CEQA for the entire
22 Forbestown Ditch Project and without having compiled and certified a full environmental impact
23 report for the Forbestown Ditch Project.

Project Title: Qroleve Ditch Line Pipe Proiect.
Project Location • Specific:
Refer to Figure I: Location Mup. The project is located approximately 4.60 miles northeast of the community of Forbestown, Califomia. More specifically, the project is located adjacent to Oroleve Creck just north of La Porte Road with the headworks at approximately 39°31'14.5'N 121°10'47.9"W and the terminus of the Oroleve Ditch at approximately 39°32'34.4N 121°11'8.2"W. Additionally, Woodlcaf Tunnel Road bisects the Oroleve Ditch at approximately the half way point along the dich.
Project Location - City: pear Woodleaf CA. Project Location - County: Butte
Description of Nature, Purpose, and Beneficiaries of Project:

Purpose and Need

The purpose of the project is to improve the existing water conveyance system and increase its efficiency by reducing raw water loss and minimize environmental contamination. The open unlined conveyance system is susceptible to both natural and man-made pollutants, vandalism, damage duc to fire, unauthorized withdrawnls, and significant water losses. The current conveyance does not reliably deliver raw water capacities due to losses.
In addition to storm related emergencies that can overwhelm the water delivery system, another risk associated with the open and unlined channel are significant water losses due to surge flows that cannot be utilized during storm events, leakage, evaporation, evapotranspiration, and unpermitted water diversion. It is estimated that between 50-70% of flows are lost to leakage and evaporation respectively.
The open and unlined ditches are causing water quality concerna at NYWD's Forbestown Water Treatment Plant. The treatment plant's Waste Discharge Requirements from the NYWD's permit renewal requires significantly reduced aluminum concentrations from overflows at the treatment plant's on-site storage
reservoir.

The project provides the following benefits: 1) Improves existing water supply reliability in all years and especially during dry and extended drought years and; 2) Removes the potential for contamination.
End point water users within the North Yuba Water District would benefit from the piping of Oroleve Ditch with more reliable drinking water supply. Additionally, the water district will benefit with lowered water losses during the use of the Oroleve Ditch.

Pipeline Overview

The project involves the piping of the Oroleve Ditch from its origination at the headworks from Oroleve Creek to the Forbestown Ditch near the Oroleve Siphon. The project will involve the placement of 36-inch high density polyethlene (HDPE) pipe within the current ditch alignment. The pipe utilized will be HDPE ADS N-12, this pipe provides smooth interior wall and corrugated exterior wall providing durability and hydraulic efficiency. This type of pipe was selected because of its ease of installation and flexibility which

allows for minor sagging and defonnation. Additionally, the integrated bell and gasket makes it a cost-
effective option as it does not require an extra coupler, grout, or special equipment for installation.
The pipe would be stabilized with anchor blocks and pipe straps approximately every 10 feet. The anchor block would be precast concrete with a saddle that the pipe would scat within. The blocks are approximately 6 inches tall, 12 inches deep, and 48 inches long with an insert on each end for pipo straps. The insert would be a 3/8" by 8" galvanized bolt and washer that would provide an attachment point for the straps. The straps would be a 2" galvanized metal strap. Minor excavations within the existing ditch may be necessary to remove organic material and sediment to a competent subgrade material that will allow for the level placement of the anchor blocks.
Access into the pipe for maintenance and observation will be achieved through the placement of two pipe AcceSS ports. The access pons will be constructed utilizing an ADS HDPE pipe ice fitting pointing upward to provide continuity within the conveyance system. The top of the tee fitting will have a cast-in-place or pre- fabricated conorete frame around the pipe with a lockable diamond plate cover or equivalent.

One open 'channel to pipe transition occurs along the alignment ncar the Oroleve ditch headworks. To facilitate water flows into the piped ditch from the open channel, the construction of headwalls to direct water into the pipe will be necessary. The headwalls will utilize quick crete bags anchored into the toe of the ditch for stabilization to direct flows. The 36-inch HDPE pipe would be mitered 1o provide a smooth 8 transition from the headwall into the pipc. The mitered section will he approximately 97 inches in length. A trash rack will be constructed to prevent large debris and trash from entering the pipe from the open channel section. The trash rack will be constructed utilizing 1.5-inch galvanized pipe where four vertical bars spaced approximately six inches apart would cover the opening of the pipe, The rack would be attached to a 12-inch by 12-inch metal plate and through the HDPB pipe which would be sealed to prevent leakage.
At the terminus of the Oroleve Ditch the pipe transitions back to an open channel. A rock lined ditch would be placed just upstream of the end point to turn out overland sheet flow from the trough and backfill material would be added near the end of the pipe to cover the pipe to a minimum depth of 12 inches. The backfilt material would have side slopes of 1:1 and would tie into the existing top of the ditch berm. The outfall at the
end of the pipe would be protected with rock slope protection to prevent scour of the outfall.
An equipment and supply staging area is proposed approximately half way along the Oroleve Ditch in an clearing that occurs adjacent to Woodlenf Tunnel Road.

Turnouts

Overland sheet flow and excess water within the ditch afignment will be channeled into a small wough that is approximately two feet wide at the top with side slopes of 1:1 with a bottomi width of one foot, it would be approximately six inches deep. The trough would be located on the opposite side of the pipe from the ditch berm adjacent to the toe of ditch. A downstream ditch flow barrier would be constructed to ensure
accumulated flow could exit the trough, Accumulated over land sheet flow within the trough would exit via a rock lined dich thet travels beneath the pipe. The rock lined ditch would be approximately five feet wide and have a slope of approximately three percent. The existing berm would need to be excavated to accommodate the rock lined ditch. The side slopes of the excavation would be 3:1 to create a smooth transition from the top of the berm into the bottom of the rock lined ditch and would continue to allow maintenancc vchicles to
travel along the ditch berm if necessary. These rock lined ditches will be located just upstream of the pipe
turnouts.

Once the pipeline is installed, surfacc water may enter the ditch. In the event any portion of the pipeline requires surface water Nlows to be diverted and released out of the ditch syslem, one turunut structure will be installed. The turnout structure will be 60-inch by 60-inch precast concrole box with two Waterman C-10 canal gates installed at cach outlet. The structure will be within the pipe eligument and will have a 36-inch HDPE outlet pipe. The outlet of the pipe will be protected with rock slope protection and gootextile fabric.

Ai.'t:

The outlet pipe will be installed at approximately 2% slope to facilitate water flow from the tumout. The existing ditch berm will have to be excavated to accommodate the new outiet pipe, backfill from the besm will be placed on top of the outlet pipe to a depth of one foot.

Moocken Elune Scction

A wooden flume is present within the ditch alignment, this wooden Nume will reed to be modified for the piping of the ditch. To facilitate placement of the 36-inch HDPE pipe in this structure the existing supports on the flume will be removed and replaced. New top supports will be approximately 2 inches by 4 inches by 80 inches while side supports witl be approximnately 2 inches by 4 inches by 55 inches. New wood supports for the bottom of the pipe will be approximately 2 inches by 4 inches by 34 inches and 4 will connect to the side supports to stabilize the pipe within the flume. Additionally, wood shims may be installed below the pipe to maintain a positive slope facilitating flow. New supports for the pipe will be installed approximatcly every 10 fect within the wooden Dume section.

Dear POD Chalrman Director Fletcher, Director Lofton, Director Hastey and Mr. Whittlesey,
Over the last three years, the Yuba Water Agency (YWA) POD committee and Board of Directors have consis- tently supported our North Yuba Water District (NYWD) effort.to complete the Forbestown Ditch Piping Project (the Project.) Thank you for helping us provide a reliable, safe source of drinking water for the approximately 3,100 customers of NYWD.

We are now at the next milestone in the Project, construction of approximately one mile, we are calling the Oroleve Ditch section. During your June 16, 2020, POD meeting, NorthStar Engineering gave formal presenta-
tion of the project.

For consideration at your July 2, 2020, POD meeting, please see the attached Oroleve Creek Project Cost docu-
ments, which represents the lowest bid, totalling $683,444 ($588,054 construction and $95,390 construction management). NYWD is designated as a Severely Disadvantaged Community (SDAC), with our residents median househald income (MHI) being less than 60% of the statewide annual MHI. Please accept this letter as a formal request for YWA funding of 70% far this project, an amount totalling $478,410. This will allow NYWD to fund the remaining 30%, in the amount of $205,034.

To recap the need for the Project, moving to a piped Forbestown Ditch will allow us to significantly lower the possibility of catastrophic breaches to the Ditch. In addition, as water moves through the unpiped Ditch up to
60% is lost due to seepage and evaporation, and contamination occurs from dirt, trash, metals and illegal mari-
Juana grows. Piping the Ditch would vastly improve, if not completely resolve, these issues. Piping the Ditch will also help to secure our water right by satisfying the State requirements the water is being put to beneficial use and curtalling losses.

Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at (530) 675-2567. Thank you for your consider-
ation of our request.

Sincerely,
SanE Jeff Maupin

[EXTERNAL MESSAGE]

Good morning Barb - we discovered this morning that North Yuba Water District (NYWD) prepared an
initial study/mitigated negative declaration for the above referenced project with a review period
ending July 22, 2020. See this link: https://ceganet.opr.ca.gov/2020069035/2

South Feather Water & Power Agency (SFWPA) requested all of NYWD's CEQA notices, including those
specific to this project. See attached October 2019 letter from SFWPA to NYWD.

Despite this request, SFWPA was not notified of NYWD's IS/MND or provided a copy of the CEQA notice
of completion. SFWPA was not afforded an opportunity to review and offer comments on the
environmental analysis or adequacy of the mitigation measures. As you know, the Upper Forbstown
Ditch, while now owned by NYWD, was formerly owned by SFWPA. It remains vital to delivery of water
to SFWPA customers. SFWPA maintains customers that are directly served from the Upper Forbstown
Ditch and pursuant to the SFWPA/NYWD 2005 Agreement a certain volume of water is

delivered/guaranteed to SFWPA through the Upper Forbstown Ditch. In short, SFWPA requested CEQA notices because it is vitally interested in ensuring no injury to SFWPA or Its custamers as a result of
NYWD's proposed project. SFWPA may even be a responsible or trustee agency under CEQA for the
proposed project, yet SFWPA is not listed at the clearinghouse as a reviewing agency.

We will begin reviewing the IS/MND immediately and will begin preparing comments. We wanted to
make you aware that SFWPA was not provided notice, despite its October request. We also wanted to hear from you on whether NYWD will even receive and consider comments, given that the clearinghouse states that the notice period ended July 22, 2020. Finally, we want to know whether NYWD has conducted a public hearing on the proposed project, certified the IS/MND, and approved a
project through the issuance of a notice of determination?

We look forward to your response. Thank you. Dustin

Re: NYWD's Oroleve Ditch Pipe Project

Dear Ms. Brenner:

We understand from North Yuba Water District's (NYWD) Resolution No. 20-744 that NYWD adopted the Oroleve Ditch Pipe Project. NYWD's Summer 2020 newsletter describes the Oroleve Project as "the first step in the larger Forbestown Ditch Piping Project."
As you know, South Feather Water & Power Agency has a standing request for all
NYWD's CEQA notices and documents associated with NYWD's projects as well as notifications of ministerial and calegorically exempt actions pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15082 and California Public Resources Code section 21092.2.

NYWD's Resolution states that the Oroleve project is categorically exempt under CEQA. However, we are not able to locate a notice of exemption on the State Clearinghouse's website. South Feather Water & Power Agency was not provided a copy.
We request confirmation regarding whether a notice of exemption was filed. If so, please provide a copy.

Re: 60 Day Notice of Intent to File Suit under the Clean Water Act

Dear North Yuba Water District,
This notice letter is to provide you with sixty days' notice of South Feather Water & Power Agency's (the "Agency") intent to file suit against North Yuba Water District (NYWD) for violation of the Clean Water Act in connection with NYWD's Oroleve Ditch Line Project in and uround Oroleve Creck ("Oroleve Project"). The violations upon which this notice letter is
based are set forth more fully below.

1. Authority to File Suit under the Clean Water Act
Section 505 of the Clean Water Aci authorizes citizens to bring suit for violation of an effluent standard or limitation, or for violation of an order issued by the Administrator of the EPA or a state with respect to such a standard or limitation. 33 U.S.C. $ 1365. This 60 day notice is being provided to NYWD, the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board ("CVRWQCB") in accordance with Clean Water Act § 505(b), 33 U.S.C. § 1365(b).

II. The Clean Water Act Prohibits Discharges of Stormwater from Construction Sites
Except in Complinnce with an NPDES or Construction Stormwater General Permit
The Clean Water Act and regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (Title 40 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) Parts 122, 123, and 124) prohibit discharges of storm water containing pollutants from construction sites larger than or
equal to one acre of land disturbance, except in compliance with a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit. State Water Resources Control Board Order 2009-0009- DWQ (As amended by 2010-0014-DWQ and 2012-0006-DWQ) ("the Order") established a
General Permit for Storm Water Discharges Associated With Construction And Land
Disturbance Activities ("General Permit"), as a general NPDES permit for construction projects in California. Prior 10 undertaking construction activity in California that disturbs one acre or more of land, the Legally Responsible Person (LRP) must obtain coverage under the General Permit. Without coverage under the General Permit, any amount of storm water discharge from the project site is prohibited by the Clean Water Act and regulations promulgated pursuant to the Clean Water Act. See 40 C.F.R. § 122.26; 33 U.S.C. § 131l.

Ill. The Oroleave Project Procceded Without the Required Stormwater General Permit, in
Violation of the Order
As a project disturbing one or more acres of soil, NYWD was and is required to obtain
coverage under the General Permit for the Oroleve Project. NYWD, an LRP as defined in Appendix 5 to the Order, failed to submit the required Permit Registration Documents (PRDs). Only a Notice of Intent (NOI) and Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) were submitted. "To obtain coverage, the LRP must electronically file Permit Registration Documents (TRDs) prior to the commencement of construction activity. Failure to oblain coverage under this General Permit for storm water discharges to waters of the United States is a violation of the CWA and the California Water Code." Order, Section II.B.2 at p. 15. PRDs consist of a Notice
of Intent (NOI), a Risk Assessment, a Site Map, a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan, an
Annual Fee, and a Signed Certification Statement. Order, Section II.B.3 at p. 15.

According to the Stormwater Unit of the CVRWQCB, and based upon information publicly indexed under SMARTS Application ID 528273, NYWD has failed to submit a number of these PRDs, including a Signed Certification Statement. The SWPPP indexed in the SMARTS database identifies North Yuba Water District as the LRP for the Oroleve Project,
estimates construction taking place between July 6. 2020 and December 3, 2020, and identifies the project area to be over one acre, at 1.5 acres of land disturbance.
Construction activity at the Oroleve Project proceeded, or is in progress, without approval or coverage under the General Permit. According to the SMARTS database, the SWPPP and NOI were resubmitted on February 26, 2021, but the application remains pending and deficient

for lack of certification. Additionally, Waste Discharger Identification (WDID) has not been issued for the project, indicating the application has not been approved.

IV. Discharges of Storm Water and Pollutants Are Identified in the SWPPP
The Oroleve Project directly discharges stor water to Oroleve Creek and eventually to the South Fork of the Feather River. See SWPPP, Section 2.1.3. This constitutes a discharge to
Waters of the United States, including sediment from the project.

Additionally, the SWPPP identifies non-Stormwater discharges purported to be authorized for the Oroleve Project, and pollutants anticipated to be used or discharged in connection with the project. See SWPPP, Section 2.5, Section 2.6, and Appendix D. As NYWD has not obtained coverage under the General Permit, these discharges are not authorized.
The Agency owns and operates water facilities downstream of Oroleve Creek, and is the recipient and injured party due to NYWD's failure to comply with the Clean Water Act (See Vl, infra).

V. NYWD Has Committed Additional Violations of the Clean Water Act, including
Failure to Obtain a 404 Permit and Failure to Obtain a 401 Water Quality
Certification
Based upon information publicly available, the Agency cannot locate, and on that basis does not believe exists, a Section 404 permit for the discharge of dredged or fill material into Waters of the United States. Any discharge of dredged or fill material into Walers of the United States, without a Section 404 permit, is a violation of the Clean Water Act.
In response to a Public Records Act request to the CVRWQCB from the Agency for documents relating to NYWD's Oroleve Project, a staff representative of the CVRWQCB stated
that no records were found for any applications received for a Section 401 Water Quality
Certification.

The Agency cannot locate a Section 401 water quality certification for the Oroleve Project, and believes that such certification does not exist. The absence of a 401 Water Quality Certification for a project discharging dredged or fill material to Waters of the United States is a
violation of the Clean Water Act.

The State of California similarly requires a 401 water quality certification issued by the
Water Boards for the discharge of dredged or fill material to waters of the state. See Water Code
§ 13160; California Code of Regulations, title 23, sections 3830-3869. Waters of the state include Waters of the United States and non-federal waters of the state. See Water Code Section
13050(€); California Code of Regulations, title 23, section 3831(w). As stated above, the

Re: 60 Day Notice of Intent 1o File Suit under the Clean Water Act Daie: March 11, 2021 Page 4

Agency cannot locate a water quality certification for the project, which is additionally a
violation of the Porter Cologne Water Quality Control Act.

Vl. The Agency Is Negatively Affected by NYWD's Violations of the Clean Water Act
The Oroleve Project discharges to Oroleve Creek and eventually to the South Fork of the Feather River. Sce SWPPP, Section 2.1.3. Oroleve is also tributary to the Forbestown Ditch. the Agency operates diversion facilities and hydroelectric powerplants on the South Fork of the
Feather River, and additionally receives water from the Forbestown Ditch. the Agency is
directly affected by illegal discharge to these waters affecting water quality.
As result of NYWD's failure to obtain the necessary permits and submit the necessary documents for the project, the Agency lacked 1) notice of the Oroleve Project; 2) the opportunity to provide input and comment on the Oroleve Project; and 3) the opportunity to protect its interests affected by the Oroleve Project.
In conclusion, this letter provides notice of the Agency's intent to file suit against NYWD to enforce the Clean Water Act, under the Act's citizen-suit provision. This notice letter is based on publicly available information available at the time of the lelter. The Agency continues to investigate these violations, and additional information may reveal additional violations of the Clean Water Act.
