Friends of Riverside's Hills v. City of Riverside
Writ Petition and Complaint

- INTRODUCTION

2 1.

3 This action challenges approvals by Respondent City of Riverside ("City" or

4 "Respondent") of the Crestview Apartments project ("Project") and the related failure to comply with

5 the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code § 21000, et. Seq.

2.

6 Among other things, the City failed to produce an adequate Environmental Impact

7 Report ("EIR") in accord with CEQA, failed to consider the environmental impacts associated with the
Project, failed to prepare

8 and circulate required environmental analysis, and failed to consider and
adopt feasible alternatives and mitigation.

9 3.

10 The Project also violates and is inconsistent with the City of Riverside's General Plan
and Municipal Code.

11 4.

12 Petitioner seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate declaring the City's

13 approvals invalid, and enjoining the City from taking steps to implement the approvals.

23 6.

24 Respondent City of Riverside ("City") is a political subdivision of the State of

25 California and the County of Riverside and a body corporate and politic exercising local government
powers, as specified by the Constitution and the laws of the State of California.

8 PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY

9 10. The Project site is situated at the northwest corner of Central Avenue and Sycamore

10 Canyon Boulevard in the City of Riverside. It is comprised of the parcel with Assessor's Parcel

11 Number 256-050-012.

12 11. The approximately 9.44-acre Project site is currently vacant. The property to the north

13 of the Project, across Sycamore Canyon Boulevard and State Route 60, is vacant. Land use to the east,

14 across Sycamore Canyon Boulevard, is a recently approved but not yet constructed commercial

15 development. Property to the south of the Project site, across Central Avenue, is also vacant. Land use

16 to the west of the Project site is the City of Riverside's Quail Run Open Space Park.

17 12. On or around May of 2020, Real Party in Interest submitted an application to the City

18 regarding the proposed Project. The proposed Project includes a total of 237 one-, two-, and three-

19 bedroom residential apartment units in seven buildings, consisting of five 3-story buildings and two 2-

20 4 split story buildings. A total of 94 units are proposed to be one-bedroom, 126 are proposed to be

21 two-bedroom, and 17 are proposed to be three-bedroom units.

22 13. The proposed project includes the following amenities: onsite leasing office, garages,

23 carports, mail lounge, putting green, outdoor resort style pool and spa, dog run area with dog wash

24 station, fitness center, clubhouse, shade structures with barbecues and tables, and a walking perimeter

25 loop trail with learning or exercise stations. Construction is anticipated to take approximately 18

26 months to be completed.

27 14. On June 30, 2020, the City issued a Notice of Preparation of a Draft EIR regarding the

28 Project. The Notice stated the Initial study and Appendices determined certain areas of concern had no

3
Friends of Riverside's Hills v. City of Riverside
Writ Petition and Complaint

P impact or less than significant impact to the environment and thus would not be analyzed further in the

2 Draft EIR. These areas of concern included: agriculture and forest resources, hazards and hazardous

3 materials, hydrology/water quality, mineral resources, population/housing, public services, and

4 recreation. Petitioner submitted comments in response and expressed concern over the lack of

5 discussion of these topics. Petitioner requested an adequate discussion and comprehensive analysis of

6 all impacts associated with the Project within the Draft EIR.

7 15. On May 3, 2021, Petitioner and other parties submitted comments to the City regarding

8 insufficiencies of the Draft EIR associated with the Project. Among other things, Petitioner noted the

9 Draft EIR's discussion of Project impacts was insufficient, including failures to adequately analyze

10 impacts to land use, aesthetic and community character, biological resources, air quality, energy use

11 and greenhouse gas emissions, and transportation. Moreover, Petitioner and other parties discussed

12 deficiencies in the Draft EIR's discussion of cumulative impacts, mitigation and alternatives.

13 16. On May 27, 2021, the City of Riverside's Planning Commission held a hearing to

14 discuss the Project and associated EIR. Petitioner and other parties submitted comments and spoke in

15 opposition to the Project and EIR and discussed the Project's various violations and inconsistencies

16 with the General Plan and Municipal Code including but not limited to: justifications provided by the

17 developer for required variance and grading exceptions which are inconsistent with the Riverside

18 General Plan Open Space and Conservation Element and other land use policies, as well as numerous

19 violations of the Municipal Code including failure to meet natural slope requirements for the
20 Residential Conservation Zone which was codified by the adoption of Measure R and Measure C.

21 Lastly, Petitioner stated the proposed findings to approve the variances and exceptions were

22 inadequate.

23 17. Despite Petitioner's concerns and concerns from many other parties, the Planning

24 Commission voted to recommend approval of the Project and EIR.

25 18. In September 2021, the City issued a Final EIR regarding the Project which did not
26 substantively revise the analysis in the Draft EIR and failed to adequately respond to comments

27 received by the City. The numerous inadequacies which existed in the Draft EIR are still present in the

28 Final EIR, as the text and appendix revisions did not demonstrate any significant or legitimate

4
Friends of Riverside's Hills v. City of Riverside
Writ Petition and Complaint

M improvements in environmental analysis in the various areas of concern.

2 19. On October 19, 2021, City Council held a hearing to consider the Project and EIR.

3 Numerous comments were received, orally and in writing, in opposition to the Project and EIR,

4 including rebuttals to responses to comments on the Draft EIR. Petitioner stated the City's responses

Un lacked evidentiary support and mostly restated previously made inaccurate assertions. Petitioner

6 discussed the lack of environmental analysis of the summary vacation of approximately 19,200 square

7 feet of excess right-of-way segment along the Project site. Petitioner explained the Project still violates

8 various Municipal Codes and remains inconsistent with the General Plan, and the associated EIR

9 continues to be inadequate.

10 20. After receiving testimony, and despite the numerous expressed concerns from

11 Petitioner and others, the City Council voted to approve the Project and EIR.

12 21. Approvals included: EIR (P19-0905), General Plan amendment (P19-0775), Zoning

13 Code Amendment (P19-0776), Design Review (P19-0777), Variances (P20-0307), Grading

14 Exceptions (P20-0308 and P20-0309), and Summary Street Vacation (P20-0310). More specifically,
15 implementation of the proposed Project required the following discretionary approvals: General Plan
16 amendment (P19-0775) to amend the land use designation from C - Commercial to VHDR - Very

17 High Density Residential; Zoning Code amendments (P19-0776) to change the zone from CG -

18 Commercial General Zone to R4 - Multiple Family Residential Zone; Design Review (P19-0777) for

19 site design and building elevations; Variances (P20-0307) to allow up to 6-foot-high perimeter solid

20 masonry walls and tubular steel fencing within the front yard setbacks, where 3-foot-high solid walls

21 and 4-foot open fencing are permitted by the Zoning Code, and to allow project improvements to

22 encroach into the 15-foot landscaped front yard setback along Central Avenue, required in the R-4

23 Zone when adjacent to an arterial; Grading Exceptions (P20-0308 and P20-0309) to allow up to 11.7-

24 foot-high retaining walls not open to public view, where the Grading Code allows a maximum height

25 of 6 feet, to allow the height of retaining walls visible from the public right of way to be up 5 to 5 feet,

26 where the Grading Code allows maximum height of 3 feet, and to allow slopes with a ratio of 3.9:1

27 or steeper to be up to 28 feet in vertical height, where the Grading Code limits slopes having a ratio of

28 3.9:1 or greater to a maximum vertical height of 20 feet; and Summary Street Vacation (P20-0310) to

5
Friends of Riverside's Hills v. City of Riverside
Writ Petition and Complaint

P vacate excess right-of-way along Sycamore Canyon Boulevard and Central Avenue, totaling 19,200

2 square feet or 0.44 acres.

3 22. On October 20, 2021, the City filed a Notice of Determination.

4 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINSITRATIVE REMEDIES
AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW
5
23. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies, and objections to the
6

7 Project have been presented orally and in writing to the City, as required by Public Resources Code

8 Section 21177. These include, but are not limited to, letters and oral comments presented during public
hearings.
9
24. Petitioner has complied with requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5 10

11 by mailing a written notice of commencement of this action to the City. A true and correct copy of that
notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.
12
25. Petitioner has advised the City that Petitioner has elected to prepare the record of
13

14 proceedings relevant to the approval of the Project, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section

15 2116.76. A true and correct copy of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.

26. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code Section 21167.7 by filing a copy 16

17 of the original petition with the California Attorney General. A true and correct copy of the

notification is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.

27. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law unless the Court grants the requested writ of 19

20 mandate requiring the City to set aside its approval of the Project and the EIR. In the absence of such

21 remedy, the City's approvals will remain in effect in violation of State law, and Petitioner will suffer

22 irreparable harm because of the significant adverse environmental impacts generated by the Project.
