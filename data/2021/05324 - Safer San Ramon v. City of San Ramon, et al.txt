1 INTRODUCTION

2 With this lawsuit, Petitioner SAFER SAN RAMON ("Petitioner"), an unincorporated

3 association, challenges the February 11, 2021 final actions taken by Respondent CITY OF SAN

4 RAMON ("City") through its City Council approving Minor Use Permit (MUP 20-501-003),

5 Development Plan (DP 20-300-002), Architectural Review Application (AR 20-200-015), and

6 Master Sign Program (MSP 20-700-001) for proposed 32-pump Costco Service Station located

7 at 3111 Fostoria Way in the City ("Project"), and adopting a finding that the Project is

8 categorically exempt from the environmental review provisions of the California Environmental
9 Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code section 21100 et seq. The Project owners and
10 proponents are Real Parties In Interest BARGHAUSEN CONSULTING ENGINEERING,

11 INC; COSTCO WHOLESALE CORPORATION; and FOSTORIA WAY, LLC (collectively

12 "Real Parties").

13 Petitioner contends the City prejudicially abused its discretion by finding the Project
14 categorically exempt from CEQA under the Class 32 "Infill-Development" exemption set forth
15 in the CEQA Guidelines, 14 C.C.R. ยง 15332. Substantial evidence in the administrative record

16 before the City establishes that the Project will result in significant effects relating to traffic,
17 noise, air quality, and/or water quality. At the same time, there is no substantial evidence in the
18 tecord to support the City's finding that the Project would have no such significant effects.
19 Petitioner accordingly seeks a peremptory writ of mandate under Code of Civil
20 Procedure section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code section 21168 commanding the City to set

21 aside its approvals for the Project, and to reconsider its action after conducting environmental

22 review of the Project's impacts in the manner required by CEQA. Petitioner further seeks a stay

23 of the effect of the City's actions during the pendency of these proceedings. Finally, Petitioner
24 seeks an award of costs and attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5,

25 together with any other relief the Court deems necessary and proper.

1 underground storage tank, a 200 square-foot controller enclosure, and vapor processor units, on

2 a 2.88-acre lot.

3 12. In April, 2020 Real Parties applied to the City for land use entitlements for the
4 Project, later submitting tevised plans in July, 2020 that incorporated comments received from

5 the City's Architectural Review Board.

6 13. On October 20, 2020 the City's Planning Commission held a public hearing on
7 the Project. Prior to the hearing, City staff issued a report declaring that the Project was

8 categorically exempt from the environmental review requirements of CEQA under the Class 32

9 categorical exemption for Infill Development. Prior to and/or duxing the hearing, Petitioner and
10 other members of the public presented oral and written comments to the Planning Commission
11 objecting to the Project and asserting that it did not qualify for an exemption from CEQA. The
12 Planning Commission thereafter continued the public hearing to November 17 and again to
13 December 15, 2020.

14 14. Prior to the December 15 heating, City staff issued additional reports and analyses
15 purporting to support a finding that the Project qualified for the Class 32 categorical exemption
16 from CEQA. Before and during the hearing, Petitioner and others presented additional oral and

17 written comments objecting to the Project, including testimony from an air quality expert and a
18 traffic expert documenting that the Project would have significant traffic and air quality impacts,
19 and therefore did not qualify for an exemption from CEQA. After closing the public hearing,
20 the Planning Commission voted to approve land use entitlements for the Project and to adopt a
21 finding that the Project was exempt from CEQA under the Class 32 exemption for In-Fill
22 Development.

23 15. Petitioner timely appealed the Planning Commission's action to the City Council
24 in accordance with the appeal provisions of the San Ramon municipal code.
25 16. On February 11, 2021 the City Council held a public hearing on Petitioner's

26 appeal. Once again, Petitioner and other members of the public presented oral and written
27 testimony prior to and duting the hearing, objecting to the Project and to the proposed finding

28 of categorical exemption from CEQA. After closing the public hearing, the City Council voted

1 to deny the appeal and to approve the Project. In doing so, the City Council adopted a finding
2 that the Project would not result in any significant impacts to traffic, noise, air quality, or water

3 quality, and therefore qualified for the Class 32 categorical exemption for In-Fill Development

4 pursuant to section 15332 of the CEQA Guidelines.

5 17. On February 12, 2021 the City posted a Notice of Exemption with the Contra

6 Costa County Clerk-Recorder-Registrar, declaring that the Project was categorically exempt
7 from CEQA under the Class 32 In-Fill Development exemption.

8 CLAIM FOR RELIEF

9 (Violation of CEQA)

10 18. Petitioner here incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs in their entirety.

11 19. At all times relevant to this action the City was the "Lead Agency" responsible for
12 the review and approval of the Project under Public Resources Code section 21067.

13 20. Upon receiving Real Party's application for land use entitlement approvals for the
14 Project, the City had a mandatory duty under CEQA to undertake: preliminary review to

15 determine whether the Project was exempt from CEQA. 14 C.C.R. ยง 15061. A project is exempt
16 from CEQA if it qualifies for one or more categorical exemptions as defined in the CEQA

17 Guidelines (see Article 19, commencing with section 15300).

18 21. Section 15332 of the Guidelines defines the Class 32 categorical exemption for

19 "In-Fill Development Projects" as follows:

20 Class 32 consists of projects characterized as in-fill development meeting the conditions
21 described in this section.

22 (a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable
23 general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations.

24 (b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more than

25 five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses.

26 (c) The project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species.

27 (d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic,
28 noise, air quality, or water quality.

2 (e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.

3 22. Any determination that a project is categorically exempt from CEQA pursuant to
4 the Class 32 In-Fill Development exemption must be supported by findings, based on
5 substantial evidence in the record before the agency, that each of the five requirements of

6 section 15332 are fully satisfied.

7 23. The City in this case determined that the Project qualified for the Class 32 In-Fill

8 Development exemption from CEQA based on findings that the five requirements of section

9 15332 were satisfied, including a finding that the Project would not result in any significant
10 effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality.

11 24. There is no substantial evidence in the record before the City to support the City's
12 finding that the Project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air
13 quality, or water quality.

14 25. There is substantial evidence in the record before the City that the Project will in
15 fact result in significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, and/or water quality.
16 26. The City therefore prejudicially abused its discretion by failing to proceed in the
17 manner required by CEQA, and by adopting findings that are not supported by substantial

18 evidence in the record.

19 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

20 27. This action is brought consistent with the requirements of Code of Civil

21 Procedute section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21177. Petitioner
22 and/or its constituent members objected to the City's approval of the Project orally and/or in
23 writing prior to the close of the final public hearing on the Project. Petitioner and/or other
24 organizations and individuals raised or affurmed each of the legal claims asserted in this petition
25 orally or in writing prior to the close of the final public hearing on the Project.

26 INADEQUATE REMEDY AT LAW

27 28. Petitioner declares that it has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the
28 ordinary course of law for the improper action of the City.

4 in the exercise of reasonable diligence, have been produced at the administrative hearing.
5 ATTORNEYS FEES

6 30. Petitioner is entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided under Code of Civil
7 Procedure section 1021.5 if it prevails in this action and the Court finds that a significant benefit

9 burden of private enforcement is such as to make an award of fees appropriate.
