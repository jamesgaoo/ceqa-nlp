PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

INTRODUCTION 1

Live Oak Trail ("Trail") is located on the north side of Lake Cachuma. From the 2 1.

3 Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors' formal adoption of the Trail in 1988 until early

4 2021, the Trail was the only publicly accessible trail in Santa Barbara County ("the County") that

5 was limited to equestrian trail riding only. Hikers/trail runners and bikers were prohibited.

6 Petitioners Suzanne Duca, Amalia Coffey, and Dale Obern Hoeffliger (collectively "Petitioners"

7 or "Plaintiffs") are equestrians who have used the Live Oak Trail ("Trail") for horseback riding

8 and wish to continue to use the trail for that purpose without their safety being compromised by

9 the addition of new non-equestrian uses.
dTT'XJAXHOS IRRAVI LIVAA BROWNSTEIN 10 2. In 1989, the County retained an environmental consulting firm to study the Trail
"Recommendation for Management Plan, Cachuma Lake Equestrian Trail" 11 route and prepare a
1001d puz *10917S edeozry 12 ("the Trail Study"). The Trail Study analyzed potential impacts of the Trail on bald eagle nesting MVTZ sAawoy 93101 VO TIEQIVA BLUES 13 and on other sensitive plant and animal habitats and on sensitive cultural resources. The Trail

14 Study reinforced the County's decision to restrict Trail usage to equestrian users only. The
§ 15 County adopted the recommendations in the study, including adopting a strictly regulated process

16 for Trail usage that required that the Trail access gates be kept locked at all times, that users

17 register with the Lake Cachuma main gate and pay a permit fee before entering the Trail. The

18 County also made the decision not to advertise the Trail in order to limit its use to local

19 equestrians. The Trail Study stated that bald eagles generally are less disturbed by horseback

20 riders than by people on foot.

21 3. The Trail is located on land owned and operated by the U.S. Department of the

22 Interior, Bureau of Reclamation ("Bureau") as part of the land largely occupied by the Lake

23 Cachuma reservoir, which provides water, including for potable and household use, to all of

24 South Santa Barbara County and much of the Santa Ynez Valley.

25 4. Commencing in or about January 2012, the Bureau leased the portion of the

26 Bureau land through which the Trail passes to private livestock grazing operators who have run

27 cattle and horses on the land ever since. The grazing operators were largely responsible for

28 maintaining roads and fencing on this land.
22860340.1

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 5. In January 1953, the Bureau leased to the County all of the land around Lake

2 Cachuma, including the area through which the Trail passes, so that the County would operate

3 and manage activities and resources on the land, subject to the grazing operations. The County's

4 lease expired, and the parties entered into a similar lease in January 2012.

5 6. In May 2010, the Federal Bureau of Reclamation adopted a programmatic

6 Environmental Impact Statement ("EIS") for the Cachuma Resource Management Plan

7 ("CRMP") applicable to all of the Bureau's land surrounding Lake Cachuma, including the Trail.

8 The EIS required that the Bureau and the County acting as the Bureau's Management Partner: (a)

0 ensure that all actions in the plan area be consistent with the CRMP; and, (b) restrict access to
J'TT'YOIHHOS MUNAVI LLVAH NIALSNMONg 10 areas with endangered or sensitive species; and, (c) adopt a Trail System Management Plan as the
11 primary mitigation measure for all Trail usage; and, (d) require site-specific environmental
10LE6 12 analysis and special status species consultation, as well as appropriate mitigation, for all future
5 tzot Anacapa Street, 2nd Floor AFTE sKauIOnY 13 actions that would result in environmental impacts beyond the programmatic analysis in the EIS. JEqrRA BUES 14 7. The CRMP includes the following:

15 82.4.2.2 -- It should be noted that the local managing partner (Parks) will be

16 required to conduct an appropriate site-specific environmental review for most of

17 the new or expanded recreational activities identified in the RMP such as new day

18 use….at Live Oak,

19 82.5.3 -- Off highway motor vehicles & downhill biking will continue to be 20 prohibited under all alternatives.
21

22 83.9.2.3 - No horseback riding allowed on 5 acknowledged trails because "One

23 trail is open on the north shore to equestrian use only."

24 83.9.2.4 - North Shore - no recreation allowed except equestrian due to managed
25 grazing and compatibility issues among hikers/trail runners, bikers & existing
26 cattle and horse grazing.

5 trails. 2

8. In May 2011, the Bureau published a Record of Decision, announcing the 3

† Bureau's decision to adopt and implement Alternative 2 (from the EIS) as the CRMP. The

5 Record of Decision includes the following Bureau response to a comment in the BIS that

6 expressed concern about the impacts of all recreational activities in and around Lake Cachuma on

7 bald eagle nesting, breeding, feeding and roosting: "The FEIS [Final Environmental Impact

8 Statement] analysis of impacts from potential management actions is programmatic .. . and

9 therefore any future actions that would result in new facilities, ground disturbances or

10 environmental impacts beyond the programmatic analysis would be subject to subsequent

11 environmental review and special-status species consultation as appropriate. . .. This ROD

15 "Administration, Operation, Maintenance, and Development of Recreation at Lake Cachuma," 9.

16 and referred to as the Management Plan, allowing the County to manage the land, subject to

17 limitations, including the following: "If, however, the Managing Partner [County] seeks to

18 enhance recreational opportunities at Cachuma Lake or develop any Recreational Facilities, or

19 implement recreational uses, these shall only occur: 31) in accordance with the Plan [CRMP],

20 and 2) after the completion of any necessary environmental review required by NEPA and

21 CEQA." The Management Agreement also requires that the County provide an annual report

22 regarding recreation related uses and/or resource s uses, yet County staff denies that records of

23 Trail usage are unavailable, except for the limited period of July 2020 through December 2020.

24 Exhibit B to the Management Agreement prohibits modification of the environment without the

25 Bureau's prior written approval. Exhibit B also requires that the County comply with all laws,

26 State and Federal, regarding pollution of streams, reservoirs, ground water, and water courses and

27 that the Endangered Species Act "will be given full consideration in all activities." A true and

28 correct copy of the Management Plan is attached hereto as Exhibit 1 and incorporated hereby.

4 22860340.1 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 10. At an unknown date, the County created an undated document, prepared without

2 public notice, hearing, or input, entitled "Live Oak Trails, Trail Management Shared-Use Access

3 Plan" ("Shared-Use Plan"), a true and correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 2 and
4 incorporated hereby. The Shared-Use Plan fails to comply with the CRMP and the EIS. The

5 stated goals of the Shared-Use Plan include the primary goal of considering and pursuing all

6 allowable activities specified in the CRMP, a balancing of natural resource protection and

7 recreational opportunities, ensuring a safer trail network, receiving input from the equestrian

8 community that have utilized this public land for over 30 years, improving County Parks

9 communication with the public and revisiting the registration process. The public had no
BROWNSTEIN J'TT'NOUHHOS HHUAVA LIVAH 10 opportunity to review and provide input regarding the development of the Shared-Use Plan

11 because the County prepared and began implementation of the Shared-Use Plan without prior
2nd Floo ppans edeoay 12 consultation opportunity with the equestrian community, or public hearing. The public notice, or aFTWe sKourony IOTE6
5
"exqxeç 13 Shared-Use Plan's sole reference to environmental review for the change of Trail use is to the

14 Bureau's 11-year old EIS, which clearly states that the Bureau and its managing partner, the
§ 15 County, must ensure that all actions in the Plan Area are consistent with the CRMP, must conduct

16 site-specific environmental review for most new or expanded recreational activities identified in

17 the CRMP, and must meet CEQA and NEPA requirements, including Section 2.5.2 of the EIS,
on south and north shores of Lake Cachuma will be 18 which states that existing levels of trail use

19 maintained and access to areas with endangered or sensitive species will be restricted.

20 11. The Shared-Use Plan violates the County General Plan Conservation Element,

21 which states that: (a) activities should not be permitted [near facilities like Lake Cachuma that

22 provide significant surface water supplies] if they would significantly degrade water quality.

23 Light recreation is permissible if sanitary pollution is permitted and erosion is not increased from

24 the increased number of people using the area; and, (b) to preserve bald eagle population, portions

25 of the lake must be left undisturbed on the North shore and the East side of Lake Cachuma; and,

26 (c) horseback riding results in less disturbance than people on foot.

27 12. The County and Bureau prohibit swimming and other direct bodily contact in Lake

28 Cachuma and in the waterways that feed the lake. The Management Plan fails to address the

5 22860340.1
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 potential threat to the public water supply resulting from trail runners/hikers having direct and

2 unsupervised access to the Santa Ynez River and Lake Cachuma via the Live Oak Trail. For

3 example, there a is a Santa Ynez River crossing with a large, deep, and inviting pool of water close

4 to the Trail entrance - just the kind of pool that would attract pedestrians and picnickers who
reach it. Anyone who has seen the evolution of another such Santa 5 won't have to walk very far to

6 Ynez River crossing, called Red Rock, from a remote, quiet, and clean pool of refreshing water

7 into a virtual cesspool with beer bottles, soiled disposable baby diapers, trash, and similar

8 unsanitary conditions will find it easy to envision a similar fate for the pool near the Trail

9 entrance as a result of the County's decision to open and advertise the Trail to all comers. The
JTI'HOIHHOS HAAHVA LLVAH NITISNMONA 10 supervision of Live Oak Trail has changed significantly. In lieu of a locked gate and the in-

11 person registration system historically required of equestrians to gain access to Live Oak Trail,
TOT£61 12 the County now leaves the gate open from 8:00 a.m, to one hour before sunset every day and has
S 100LA puz '190nS edeseury TZ0l 1e sKaurony 13 implemented an honor system that allows a user to take a parking permit without even paying the JBQBH EIUES 14 $10.00 permit fee. Access to the lake and river water supplies from the Trail is now wide open to

In November 1990, the County Board of Supervisors adopted Resolution No. 90- 18

19 757, establishing the County Riding and Hiking Trails Advisory Committee ("CRAHTAC"). The 13.

20 Resolution provides, inter alia, that, when a County department considers activities that may

21 affect County trails, equestrian facilities, and bikeways, etc., the Department first shall inform

22 CRAHTAC and CRAHTAC shall deliberate on such matters and decide on a recommendation to

23 the appropriate County official. A true and correct copy of Resolution No. 90-757 is attached as
24 Exhibit 4 and incorporated hereby. As described in more detail in a letter dated May 5, 2021, the

25 CRAHTAC Chair disputes a claim made in the Shared-Use Plan to the effect that CRAHTAC

26 requested that County Parks "explore hiking and biking on Cachuma's north shore." A true and
of the CRAHTAC letter is attached hereto as Exhibit 5 and incorporated hereby. 27 correct copy

6 22860340.1 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 14. On January 12, 2021, the Santa Barbara Community Services Department

2 "Community Services") executed a Notice of Exemption ("NOE"). A true and correct copy of

3 the NOE is attached hereto as Exhibit 3 and incorporated hereby. The NOE was not posted on the

4 County website, on the Clerk of the Board's website, on the Community Services website, or on

5 the State Clearinghouse website. On January 12, 2021 and for several months following, due to

6 policies enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Santa Barbara County administrative

7 building was locked and not open for general public access. A guard at the building entrance

8 allowed for limited access to the administrative building for limited purposes, such as payment of

9 property taxes. The County website failed to provide to the general public notice that CEQA
d'TT'MIIHHOS XNTHVI LIVXH NIZISNMONA 10 notices, ordinarily accessible at the Office of the Clerk of the Board, were available for inspection

11 anywhere other than the Clerk of the Board's office. Instead, the Clerk of the Board's website
Flao 12 MFTLE SÁawony IOI£6' p0c Y9aas Rdrdety IEQIEE BIVES merely stated that the office was closed to the public. Community Services made no effort to

13 reach out to inform the equestrian community about an intended change in use of the Live Oak

14 Trail and the creation and posting of the NOE.
IZ01 15 15. The County also failed to comply with the requirements for alternative notice of

16 the NOE, included in the California Governor's Executive Order N-54-20, which provides that,

17 in lieu of the usual public posting and filing of materials concerning the project, the lead agency

18 shall do ALL of the following:

19 a) Post such materials on the relevant agency's or applicant's public-facing website

20 for the same period of time that physical posting would otherwise be required.

21 b) Submit all materials electronically to the State Clearinghouse CEQAnet Web

22 Portal; and

23 C) Engage in outreach to any individuals or entities known by the lead agency,

24 responsible agency, or project applicant to be parties interested in the project in the

25 manner contemplated by the Public Resources Code section 21100 et seq. and California

26 Code of Regulations, Title 14, sections 15000 et seq.

27 16. The NOE states that the purpose of the Live Oak Trails Multi-Use Program,

28 identified in the PROJECT TITLE portion of the NOE, was to "allow hikers and mountain bikers

7 22860340.1
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 on these roads and trails, in addition to equestrians (multi-use)," and concludes, without any

2 additional environmental review, that "the proposed Live Oak Trails Multi-Use Program does not

3 involve an expansion of use under the reasonably same parameters that currently exist, therefore,

4 change in signage indicating this usage is exempt from CEQA," But the identified project is not

5 installation of signage; it is a significant change in the historical use of the Trail from equestrian

6 only to a multi-use trail open to trail runners/hikers and, mountain bikers - all of which will

7 greatly increase the number of Trail users.

8 17. This change in use from low-key equestrian use by the local horse community,

9 closely regulated by Parks staff, to freely allowing trail runners/hikers and mountain bikers to use

10 the Trail without close supervision, not only is directly contrary to the adopted CRMP, but will

11 result in potentially significant impacts on the safety of equestrians and their horses - and of 100LH puz 909nS vÉUORUY IZOI I'TT'NOTHHOS MUSAVA LIVAH NIAISNMONg 12 members of the public who will be interacting with range cattle -- significant impacts upon MVT18 SKaTIONy TOTE6 VD 'IEqRE 13 grazing livestock, and impacts on sensitive species, habitat, and cultural resources, all of which

14 environmental issues require CEQA review and far exceed the scope of the NOE.
not properly noticed, and it falsely claims that 15 18. The NOE is invalid because it was

16 the changes in historical use of the Trail from solely equestrian to mixed trail running/hiking and

17 mountain biking are exempt from CEQA review. Procedurally, it the NOE appears to be invalid

JURISDICTION AND VENUE 3

4 25. The Santa Barbara Superior Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged herein

5 pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 526, 527, 1085, 1094.5 and Cal. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168

6 and 21168.5

7 26. Venue is appropriate in Santa Barbara County pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§

8 393, 394 and 395 because Respondents are located within the County of Santa Barbara.

STANDING 9

d'TI MJAHHOS MNAXVA LIVAH NIMISNMONg 10 27. Petitioners have a direct and substantial beneficial interest in Respondents full

11 and complete compliance with CEQA, and all other applicable laws.
IOLE6 12 28.
8 1001d puz 400nS edeoen ICOI Respondents owed a mandatory duty to act within the boundaries of their legal MPT3N SKouJOnY Santa Barbara, 13 authorities under CEQA and all other applicable laws before exercising its discretion to change
14 the use of Live Oak Trail and file the NOE.

15 29. Petitioners also have the right to enforce the public's right and duties that CEQA

16 and all other applicable laws impose on Respondents.

17 30. Petitioners have no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course
18 of law, and will suffer irreparable injury unless this court issues the relief requested herein.

19 Petitioners have used Live Oak Trail for trail riding. Respondents' approval of the change in use
20 of Live Oak Trail harms Petitioners by threatening impairment of their reasonable and beneficial

21 use of Live Oak Trail. Mixed use of the Trail will result in both safety issues and environmental
22 issues that will impair equestrian use of the Trail, could result in Lake contamination, and allows

23 for trail runners/hikers and mountain bikers to enter into and damage sensitive natural and

24 cultural resources.

25 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

26 31. There was no publicly noticed hearing that preceded the NOE that Petitioners are

27 aware of for the change in use from solely equestrian to added hiking and mountain biking.
28 /11

22860340.1
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 32. If any grounds for noncompliance with CEQA and other applicable laws alleged in
not raised prior to Respondents' approval of the Project, it 2 this Petition were, for some reason,

3 was because there was no meaningful opportunity for members of the public to raise those

4 objections prior to the approval of the Project. Respondents failed to give notice required by law

5 before launching the change of use, and/or because any attempt to exhaust administrative

6 remedies would be futile.

7 33. Petitioners have therefore exhausted their administrative remedies.
FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND 8

9 34. The Trail, located to the north of Lake Cachuma, has been for decades an
d'TI'NQHAHOS MARAVA JLVAH BROWNSTEIN 10 equestrian only trail. Hiking and biking were prohibited. Until 2021, the Trail was the only

11 publicly accessible equestrian-only trail in Santa Barbara County. Now there are no equestrian- 100LI puz 007S vdeovuy 170l 12 only trails in the County. In contrast, horseback riding is prohibited on many trails throughout the MVT IE SÁOUIONY TOTE6 VO 'BIEQIEH TIUES 13 County, including all of the other trails in the Lake Cachuma recreation area, and many public

14 trails in the County are expressly designated as being solely for mountain bikes or solely for trail

15

16 35. Respondents manage the trail pursuant to an agreement with the United States runners/hikers.

17 Bureau of Reclamation. Respondents are required to comply with the Cachuma Resource

18 Management Plan ("CRMP").

19 36. On January 12, 2021, the Santa Barbara Community Services Department created

20 an NOE contending that the change in use from equestrian-only use of the Trail to mixed hiking

21 and mountain biking was exempt from CEQA review (this change of use is also referred to from

22 time to time herein as "the Project").

23 37. Under CEQA (Guidelines Section 15062 (c)(2 & 3) when a local agency files an

24 NOE, it shall be filed with the County Clerk. Copies will be available for public inspection and

25 posted in the County Clerk's office for 30 days. The Clerk then is required to return the NOE to

26 the local agency with a notation of the time period it was posted. The local agency must retain

27 the NOE for at least 12 months. Public agencies are encouraged to make NOE "postings

28 available in electronic format on the Internet."

10 22860340.1 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 38. Governor's Executive Order N-54-20 was signed 4/22/2020 and addresses CEQA

2 compliance. It suspends public filing requirements for 60 days, but provides that if a public

3 agency would otherwise be required to publicly post or file materials available to the public, the

4 lead agency shall do "all of the following: (a) post the materials on the agency's public-facing

5 website for the same time period that physical posting would be required; (b) submit all materials

6 electronically to the State Clearinghouse CEQAnet web portal; and (c) engage in outreach to any

7 individual and entities known by the lead agency to be parties interested in the project. In

8 addition to the foregoing, lead agencies are also encouraged to pursue additional methods of

9 public notice and outreach as appropriate for particular projects and communities."
BROWNSTEIN HXATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 10 39. Although Respondents contend that they posted the NOE in the lobby of the Santa
11 Barbara County Administration Offices at 105 E. Anapamu Street, Santa Barbara, California,
IOI£6 12 entry to the building was locked as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. There was no general
8 100LI puz yoans adwaguy MFT18 SKIUI0WY 'RJEqJEA BUES 13 public access to the building or the lobby. Access was allowed for certain specific purposes, but
14 there was no general notice that there was access to review CEQA notices in the lobby.
8 15 Respondents could have posted the NOE on the County website or sent it to the State
16 Clearinghouse, but they chose not to do so. Nor did Respondents make any effort to reach out to
17 the equestrian community or organizations promoting equestrian use of Live Oak Trail to give

18 them advance notice of the NOE. If the NOE was in fact posted in the lobby, Petitioners had no
19 knowledge of the NOE or meaningful opportunity to review the NOE and object to its use for this
20 Project.

27 41. The NOE and the change in use of the Trail are invalid because, among other
28 things, the CRMP provides that with any change to the level of use from livestock grazing with

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 only very carefully regulated equestrian use, which required people to personally sign in at the

2 Lake Cachuma office before using the Trail, additional environmental review would be

3 necessary. The CRMP also calls for a site-specific trail management plan, which was not

4 implemented. County staff recently prepared a document that purports to be a trail management

5 plan for this Trail, but the document is undated, had no public vetting, and fails to constitute a

6 meaningful or valid trail management plan.

7 42. In addition, County staff has failed to disclose when Respondents made the

8 decision to open the Trail to trail runners/hikers and, ultimately, to mountain bikers. There was

9 no noticed public hearing and no opportunity for the public and the equestrian community to

10 participate in the process of changing the use of the Trail. If the NOE was issued prior to the

11 County making a decision to make the change in use, it is invalid, in that Section 15062(b) of the
I Floo 3 12 CEQA Guidelines states that "The notice [of exemption] shall not be filed with the county clerk MET 18 sawony d'TT'MOTHHOS MIHAVI LIVAH NITISNMOXE § 139nS adeoer "ErEqIEg NICES 13 or OPR until the project has been approved." The County staff's refusal to identify an approval

14 that the NOE is either ineffective or untimely, in addition to being misleading. date suggests
§ 15 43. The NOE used by the County for this project falsely states that adding new Trail

16 user categories is not a significant expansion of use and there are no special circumstances in this

17 situation (which ignores the nesting bald eagles that the CRMP indicates need special protection).

18 The NOE states that there's no expansion of use "under the reasonably same parameters that

19 currently exist." That is entirely false for a long list of reasons, including those referenced herein,

20 but they include the potential hazards created by people on foot swimming in the Santa Ynez

21 River immediately upstream from Lake Cachuma or in the Lake itself. Neither use is allowed
because of the potential threat to the drinking water supply for South Coast and Santa Ynez 22

23 Valley residents.

24 44. The exemptions relied upon in the NOE do not apply to the County's closed-door

25 decision to significantly change the use of Live Oak Trail. Neither the statutory nor categorical

26 exemption was proper to rely on in these circumstances.

1 45. Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2, subdivision (c), "A categorical

2 exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity

3 will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances."

4 46. There are "unusual circumstances" concerning change in use from solely

5 equestrian trail riding to mixed pedestrian and mountain biking use of the Trail. The unusual

6 circumstances give rise to potentially significant environmental impacts including: (1) bald

7 eagles nesting and roosting sites; (2) water quality; (3) interaction between pedestrians and range

8 cattle and range horses; (4) health and safety issues with combining horseback riding with

9 pedestrians and mountain bikers; and, (5) impacts to sensitive species and their habitats and upon
BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 10 cultural resources.

11 47. The significant impacts and unusual circumstances described above make it 1001 I0L6' 3 MBTqe sKauzony 12 impossible for Respondents to rely on a categorical exemption to approve this change in use,
5 jeems edeoguy IZOI Santa Barbara,' 13 which not only opens the door to a significant increase in parking demand and human traffic, but

14 allows for easy access to a major source of potable water for local residents. There is more than a

15 reasonable possibility under these circumstances that the Project will have a significant effect on
16 the environment. Accordingly, Respondents improperly determined that the Project is

17 categorically exempt from CEQA.

18 48. Respondents' improper determination that the Project is exempt from the

19 provisions of CEQA constitutes prejudicial abuse of discretion. Plaintiffs request a writ of
20 mandate, requiring that Respondents cease implementation of the Project unless and until they

21 comply with the requirements of CEQA, NEPA, and all other applicable laws.

EXHIBIT H: RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PLAN GUIDELINES

The Resource Management Plan (Plan) is to be developed with the following goals:
Planning, through Resource Management Plans (R.MPs), provides specific direction for Reclamation to accomplish its mission at water resource development projects for lands directly managed by Reclamation and for lands cooperatively managed with another Federal or non-Federal entity. The guidance provided herein is discretionary, and are to be considered only as reference materials; however, the guidance provided will result in an RMP document that can effectively assist Reclamation in planning, decision-making, and implementing actions and activities affecting the resources under its jurisdiction. Because resource situations/issues differ greatly among the different Reclamation regions and from State to State, creativity and flexibility are allowed in preparing RMP documents so that they can address specific issues that meet local public expectations and address specific resource conditions. This Resource Management Plan Guidebook is intended to be a dynamic document which will be updated, as
necessary. The RMP is to chart the desired future condition for the arca in question-the resultant
biological, physical, and social condition that Reclamation desires to see once all the RMP management actions have been implemented. The RMP document should be sufficiently detailed to direct future development, but it should be flexible enough to allow resolution of day-to-day
problems.

Goals
The demand for Reclamation lands and water is increasing at a phenomenal rate.
Recrcation use is currently expanding by an estimated 1.2 million visitors per year at Reclamation reservoirs. Because there is increasing competition for the use of Federal lands by a variety of users (e.g., recreationists, power companies, oil and gas companies, and special interest groups), RMPs are a valuable tool that will help Reclamation make informed decisions affecting competing uses of its lands. In addition, the overall objectives for completing an RMP should be consistent with the
objectives identified in Reclamation's 2000 -2005 Strategic Plan, which include the following: P Manage, develop, and protect water and related resources to meet the needs of current and future
generations P Operate, maintain, and rehabilitate facilities safely, reliably, and efficiently to provide Reclamation Project (Project) benefits P Advance Reclamation's organizational effectiveness

61

Agreement Number 11-LC-20-0223

An RMP provides management direction consistent with authorized Project purposes while, al the
same time, recognizing the rights and interests of existing contracts, legislation, and other entities concerning an identified land area that is under the jurisdiction of Reclamation.
An RMP identifies measures necessary to achieve a desired future condition of the resources within
a management arca covered by the RMP. Management direction is set forth in the form of goals, objectives, standards, and guidelines. These, in turn, set the stage for management actions, activities,
and uses that affect management frameworks and partnerships, land management, and water,
recreation, visual, natural, and cultural resources. The management direction could be general in nature to the management area (area-wide) or unique to a portion of the management area (site specific). Monitoring and evaluation of an RMP are intended to ensure conformance and good stewardship.

EXHIBIT 2

Live Oak Trails COUNTY
Trail Management Shared-Use Access Plan PARKS

Background The Live Oak Trails are on the north eastern portion of Cachuma Lake. The Live Oak trails include 15 miles of trails on 3,000 acres of leased grazing land with existing trails consisting of mostly ranch service roads (90% ranch roads / 10% non-vehicular trail). Public access is currently restricted to equestrians on
horseback only. Hiking is not currently permitted.
A 25-year lease with the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) was adopted in by the Board of Supervisors in
2012 and authorizes County Parks to manage recreation within the Cachuma Recreation Area. Guidance
is through the BOR Resource Management Plan, 2010 (RMP) which, among other recreational opportunities, allows for hiking and biking under a similar system currently used by the equestrians. Providing hikers access to Live Oak Trails is specifically identified as the preferred alternative presented in the BOR's Cachuma Lake Resource Management Plan (as is biking).
In 2019, Santa Barbara County Parks (Parks) received a request by the County Riding and Hiking Trail Advisory Committee (CRAHTAC) to explore hiking and biking on Cachuma's north shore. CRAHTAC has stated that many conversations had occurred over the years with no action taken by Parks.
The shared use access program for Live Oak will allow hiking only at Live Oak. At this time, biking, camping, swimming and other BOR approved north shore opportunities are not being considered and
will not be allowed.

Live Oak Trails Goals
The primary goal of the land manager, Parks, is to consider and pursue all allowable activities as
specified by the RMP.
Balance natural resource protection and recreational opportunities within the Cachuma
Recreation Area.
Ensure a safer trail network. Rangers to routinely monitor trails / parking area to address and
document violations and incidents. Spearhead area lamiliarization with EMS Responders,
Search and Rescue and County Parks Rangers.
Receive input from the equestrian community that have utilized this public land for over 30
years.
Maintain excellent communication with grazing teaseholder. The ranching and grazing
operation consist of nearly 20 competition rodeo horses occupying the property year-round and
around 300 head of cattle grazing from Fall to Spring.
Improve Parks communication with the public. Revisit the intensive and confusing registration
process. Update the website and improve / replace outdated signage. Consider future infrastructure and facility improvements including equestrian amenities.

Public Involvement and Feedback
The Bureau of Reclamation has considered comments on the Draft EIS which Included hiking and biking
on the LIve Oak Trails during the public review period that concluded on October 31, 2008, and Included public hearing on August 26, and October 8, 2008. The final EIS Includes editorial and technical changes, factual corrections, and clarifications made in response to public comments.
Additional comments from the public can be provided regarding Live Oak Trall at trails@sbparks.org.
Emalls may be used to build a user database of Interested parttes for further outreach. The registration
process and signage will dfrect trail users to the Parks email to encourage continued public feedback,
The County Riding and Hiking Trail Advisory Committee (CRAHTAC) Includes Live Oak trails as a standing agenda Item for discussion.

Trall Access
Currently, equestrians must be holding a County Parks day-use or annual permit and make a reservation
with Rangers each day they visit. Although no limits are specified by Parks on the number of equestrians that can visit LIve Oak, visitation Is extremely low. County Parks has been tracking data on equestrian registration which averaged around 2.4 registered rders per day (from July 2020 to December 2020)
and increased to six registered riders per day with some promotion of the trail in late Winter 2020 and
early Spring 2022. According to equestrian groups, organized group trail rides have been attended by
nearly 100 equestrians at one time at Live Oak.
Once hiking is introduced, new users will need to be educated on the registration process as the current process Is confusing. Uve Oak access will be managed simller to Forest Service trail access. Users will
simply park at the trallhead, register their vehicle in the parking lot, pay a $10 fee or display their valid pass and access the trails for the day,
Users must have one of three Cachuma Lake passes or pay a $10 fee on site. Acceptable passes Include:

1. A valid County Parks annual pass,
2. A valld Cachuma day use permit,
3. A valld Cachuma overnight camping permit, or
4. Onsite registration with a $10 day-use fee paid at the "Fee tube/iron ranger" at the trall head
gate.

The Cachuma Lake front gate will nn longer register users for Live Oak Trail. Rangers will open the live Oak gate before 8:00 am and close the gate before sunset seven days per week and patrol the parking lot and trails as needed.

Trail access angoing tosks to be revlewed perfodically:
Improve sign clarity.
Consider installing cameras to monitor the parking area and front gate.
Consider developing a parking lot plan.
Work with grazing leaseholder on gates, fences and any Issues. Work with the equestrian community on equestrian and hiker etiquette. Perform supervised site visits with all user groups and interested parties.

Page 2 of 16

.

This registration system should limit confusion and allow for better public compliance. This will allow Parks to assess demand and continue to improve the process. Parks should revisit this process aften to
ensure it is the appropriate public access strategy.
Restrictions and Vlolations
All Parks Chapter 2G Ordinances (Appendix C) apply to Live Oak trails.
Noteworthy rules
Dogs are prohlbited due to cattle and horses on the property.
•Camping is not allowed et Live Oak tralls, no overnight parking at the trailhead parking lot.
No bicycles, ebikes or motorized vehicies. No swimming In Cachuma Lake or the Santa Ynez River.
Parking Area Modifications Parking Is restricted to the lower Lve Oak lot from 8:00 am to one hour before sunset, year-round. Warnings (with trail access rules) will be placad on any cars found in the lot after that time and their information will be logged. Repeat violators can be ticketed. A gate at the far end of the parking lot before LIve Oak Camp has been Instalted to prevent trespassing Into the camp area faclities.

Portable restroom added to Live Oak trall head parking area.
Pack It in/Pack it out; no trash services avallable. Monitor for issues.
Consider a designated equestrian staging area with horse tie ups/water trough.
Replace existing front entry signs and "Please Close the Gate" signs. Signs should address Hours
of Operations, Reglstration Procedures, No Hunting, Close Gates, Stay on the Designated Trails, No Feeding of Horses/Cattle, No Swimming, Horse/Hiker Etiquette Including General Trall
Etiquette (https://www.fs.usda.gov/internet/ESE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd553395.2df).
Trall Maintenance Trall maintenance is the process of keeping a trail at its intended standards while ensuring that the trail Is safe for public use. The maintenance of a trall includes numerous efforts ranging from mowing, brush removal, the replacement of daraged signs, or oven to reconstruct the trall. Trail maintenance includes keeping the trail free from obstructions as well as ensuring proper drainage and tread maintenance, and addressing social tralls. A well-maintained and constructed trail will provide visitors with a safe, pleasant, and memorable nature experience.
The grazing leaseholder is currently responsible for trails and associated trall maintenance, fencing, and gates throughout the Lease 1 area which includes Live Oak. Parks, along with approval from the grazing leaseholder, will perform, or supervise, routine maintenance and trail projects on public access trall corridors and is responsible for all trail maintenance activitlas.
Parks has general Ranger and maintenance staff that can be utlized for limited trall related projects and ts interested in becoming more involved at Live Oak. For over fifty years, Parks has partnered with 501(c)(3) not-for-profit trall organizations to Improve and maintain the County's extensive trall system. Experienced trail crews supplemented by volunteers organized by non-profit organizations wil perform most routine malntenance with permission from Parks.

Trail Maintenance Standards
V.S. Forest Service Design Parameters:
Tread Width (inches): 18" -48"
Target Grade (%): 3% - 12% max (ideally, no more than 8%)
Switchback Radius (feet): 5-8 feet Target Cross-Slope (%): 5% - 10% Clearing Width (inches): 72" -96" Clearing Height (feet): 12 clearance (Ideally, no less than 10')
Short Pitch Maximum (%): 20% (up to 200' lengths)

Reference: USFS Trail Standards, Gaviota Coast Plan-Trail Construction Specifications

Social Trails
Social tralls are tralls that are made by users to shortcut or visit a destrable arca where an actual trall
does not go. These tralls are not on the offictal map and are not part of the trail network. These social
trails will be addressed to avoid erosion Issues and to prevent damage to resources.

Live Dak has an extensive network of social/cattle trails. Parks will monitor and address these social
trails while considering sustainability and impacts to the environment. Parks will consider cosure of
these soclal tralls to allow the trail to heal. Some soctai tralls may be adopted In the future wlth
environmental review.

Trail Conditions and Access
Historically, the tralls and roads are ellher graded by the grazing leaseholder or they are only there because of equestrian use. Additlonal trail maintenance standards should be emploved to meet modern day trall maintenance best practices, Trall maintenance is commonly accomplished by volunteer trall work days led by a certified trail maintenance lead. Poorly designed and maintained trails can erode more from water than a well-designed trail that receives heavy (RMP, Sec 8.10.2.2).

Protocoi to Close Off Traits During Wet Conditions
When precipitation reaches around 0.25 inch/hour in any 24-hour period trails will be closed fora mintmum of one day. When the water levei is high on the river crossing at the parking lot, the trail system will be closed.

Livestock Considerations Live Oakls as an active cattle and horse grazing area. Trails zhrough or near grazing lands exist throughout Santa Barbara County, Renching, grazing and agriculture are generally considered
compatible with trails and public access.

Trail users can oxpect to encounter horses throughout the year and cattle from approximately
November to June. The grazing leaseholder has Indicated that livestock should not bother people.
Good communication with the leaseholder must be maintained.

Some considerations are necessary to keep the public safe and the livestock secure. Gates can be
modifled to spring loaded and self-latching with proper signage telling visitors to keep gates closed. Any
modifications to gates or trails should be equestrian friendly. Visitors will be notified with proper
signage to stay away from animais during their visit. Current signs say "This trail is also used for grazing,

Page 4 of 16

you may encounter horses or cattle. Proceed at your own risk." Additional signage is in Appendix A and
will remind visitors to close the gates or not to feed livestock,

Appendix D - Emergency Response Pian

Emergency Response
Currently, there are few Incidents on the Lve Ook Trails. County Parks is aware of the possibllity of an
increase in accidents or medical emergencies when hiking is Introduced. Heatstroke, injuries from the
loose terrain and even animal encounters all have potental to require emergency response.
Nearly all of the trails are accessible with a 4X4 County Parks or Fire Pickup Truck. Additionally,
Cachuma Lake Rangers have two patrol boats which coold provide quickest access to some tralls. Cell reception throughout the trails is generally good but should not be relied upon when in the backcountry, particularly in low lying valleys.

NOTICE OF EXEMPTION
TO: Santa Barbara County Clerk of the Board of Supervisors
FROM: Community Services Department. Parks Division
a Based on a preliminary review of the project, the following activity is determined to be exempt from further environmental review requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) of 1970, as defined in the State and County Guidelines for the implementation of CEQA.

PROJECT TITLE: Live Oak Trails Multi-Use Program
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: The Live Oak trails system consists of approximately 15 miles of existing dirt roads and trails on the North Shore of Cachuma Lake. These trails are on leased grazing land within the Cachuma Lake Recreation Area in Santa Barbara County which is owned by the Bureau of Reclamation ("BOR") and managed by the Santa Barbara County Community Services Department Parks Division ("Parks"). The lease has allowed horses and cattle to graze the land. Historically, the BOR. and Parks have allowed equestrians to access the trail system which is approximately 90% dirt service roads.

~ Ministerial
Statutory ..X. Categorical Exemption
•••RS 7
5 RECEIAN 4LUEIVEA SIVED Emergency Project
No Possibility of Significant Effect

N Cite specific CEQA Guideline Section: Section 15301 (g)
Reasons to support exemption findings (attach additional material, if necessary): The proposed action is categorically exempt from environmental review pursuant to Section 15301 [Existing Facilities/ of the Guidelines for Implementation of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The CEQA Existing Facilities exemption at Section 15301 allows for the operation, repair, maintenance, permitting, leasing, licensing, or minor alteration of existing public or private structures, facilities, mechanical equipment, or topographical features, involving negligible or no expansion of use. The proposed Live Oak Trails Multi-Use Program does not involve an expansion of use under the reasonably same parameters that currently exist, therefore, change in signage indicating this usage is exempt from CEQA in accordance with Section 15301 (g).
With regard to the proposed project, the exceptions to the Existing Facilities categorical exemption that must be considered pursuant to Section 15300.2 of the State CEQA Guidelines are':
(a) Location. Classes 3,4,5,6, and I1 are qualified by consideration of where the project is to he located - e project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these classes are considered to apply in all instances, except where the project may impact on an environmental resources of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely mapped, and official adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.

The Secti on 15301 is 1 Class 1 Categorical Exemption, therefore, this exception is not applicable.
(b) Cumulative Impact. All exemptions for these classes are inupplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the sume type in the same place, over time is significant.
There are no successive projects of the same type in the same place anticipated for this location. There is only an expansion of mode of usage on existing ranch roads. There is no cumulative impact and, therefore this exception does not apply.
(c) Significant Effect. A categorical exemption shall not be used for CLI activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual
circumstances.

The expanded trail use on an existing road/trail system will not result in any physical changes or have significant impacts to the environment and therefore will not result in a significant effect on the
environment.

(d) Scenic Highways. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to trees, historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or simitar resources, within a highway officially designated as a state scenic highway. This does not apply to improvements, which are required as mitigation by an adopted negative declaration or certified EIR.

This proposed project is on existing roads and trails, and as such this exception does not apply.
(e) Hazardous Waste Sites. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project located on a site which
is included on any list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of the Government Code.
This proposed project is not located on a site which is included on any list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of the Government Code. Therefore, it is not located on a hazardous waste site and this exception
does not apply.
() Historical Resources. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.
This proposed project does not involve any impact to historical resources. Users must stay on existing ranch roads and trails. This exception does not apply.
As described above, none of the exceptions to the categorical exemptions contained within Section 15300 .2 of
the State CEQA Guidelines apply to this project.

Dan Gira "In 2019, Santa Barbara County Parks (Parks) received a
3rd DISTRICT
Curt Cragg request by the County Riding and Hiking Trail Advisory

Faith Decter Committee (CRAHTAC) to explore hiking and biking on
Michael Hecker Cachuma's north shore. CRAHTAC has stated that many

4th DISTRICT conversations had occurred over the years with no action taken
Archie Mitchell by Parks."
Ruth Schuyler

5th DISTRICT We feel it is important to state that not only did CRAHTAC not

Frank Frietas direct Santa Barbara County Parks Department to initiate a pilot
Barry Stotts program at Live Oak Equestrian Trail, CRAHTAC has repeatedly

STAFF voiced solid concerns and disagreement especially with the idea
Jeffery Lindgren of mountain biking and trail running being commingled with
Jon Menzies equestrian use of The Live Oak Equestrian Trail.
CRAHTAC requests that paragraph 3, page be re-written to
correctly reflect that CRAHTAC has voiced concern.

Sincerely,

Otis Caleb

Chair CRAHTAC

CRAHTAC • 123 E. Anapamu St, 2% Floor CSD • Santa Barbara CA 93101

Specifically, CRAHTAC requests that paragraph 3 on page 1 be removed from
the Trail Management Plan as CRAHTAC did not urge the Park's Department
to change the status of Live Oak Equestrian Trail and no such request is
reflected in the minutes.

CRAHTAC is concerned that coastal access in the North County is
extremely limited and that the Dangermond Preserve occupies a
significant segment of the County's shoreline. We are concerned the
hundreds of thousands of residents of northern Santa Barbara County
have been deprived of equitable coastal access, and that given the
disproportionate share of low income and minority households in North
County, that this is a serious environmental justice issue. CRAHTAC
would recommend The Nature Conservancy work in a cooperative
manner with the County to establish the CCT through the Dangermond
Preserve.

The CCT along with the Pacific Crest Trail is one of the two most
important trails in the State and the Gaviota Coast is one of the most
scenic and important segments of the CCT. Provision of open public
access to and along the shoreline would be consistent with both the
spirit and letter of both County and State policy.
1. Inland Trails: CRAHTAC understands that the Dangermond Preserve
supports an extensive network of existing ranch roads. We believe that
some of these roads, and potentially alternative routes for new trails
should be explore for creation of an open public multiple use trail
system. Such a trail should be muitiple use and open to hikers, mountain
bikers, trail runners, dog walkers and equestrians. We feel that open
public access to selected areas of the Dangermond Preserve can certainly
be provided consistent with the goal of protecting and restoring the
Preserve's sensitive biological and cultural resources.

2. In closing, we appreciate The Nature Conservancy considering our comments
and respectfully request that the Conservancy reach out to CRAHTAC and
other recreational organizations such as the Santa Barbara County Trails
Council, the Back Country Horsemen, Sage Trail Alliance and others as part of
its master plan process which should including planning for open recreational
trail access. Please feel free to contact Jon Menzies of County staff at
JMenzies@sbparks.org or Mr. Michael Hecker at hecktone@icloud.com.
