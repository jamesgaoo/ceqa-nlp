1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the December 31, 2020 decision of the County of
3 Tuolumne and its Board of Supervisors (collectively, "Respondents") to approve the Terra

4 Vi Yosemite Lodge project (*Project") and to certify the associated Environmental Impact
5 Report ("EIR"). The County's approval-made late in the afternoon of December 31st and
6 just hours before a new a Board of Supervisors would be seated-will allow the construction
7 of a resort-style hotel with 100 guestrooms, 26 cabin guestrooms, 5 employee apartments,
8 a helipad, a dining room/bar, and a public market. Located just west of a prime gateway
9 into Yosemite National Park, the project site is designated as a Very High Fire Hazard
10 Severity Zone, and the Project will draw hundreds of daily visitors to an undeveloped
11 natural site surrounded by rural residential and National Forest land. The impacts of the
12 Project will be made all the worse by the Yosemite Under Canvas project, a 99-room
13| "glamping" project that will be located immediately across Highway 120 from the Project
14 and was approved by Tuolumne County on December 17, 2020.

15 2. In its haste to approve the Project before the end of 2020, the County made
16 numerous procedural and substantive errors. The County neglected to respond to
17 comments on the draft EIR as required by the California Environmental Quality Act,
18 Public Resources Code section 2100 et. seq. ("CEQA"), even though it was clearly
19 informed of this failure at the public hearing on the Project. Rather than correct this failing,
20 the County inaccurately claimed that the comments had not been submitted during the
21 public comment period, notwithstanding direct testimony (supported by the evidentiary
22 record) that the comments had been timely submitted. The County also failed to include a
23 Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program ("MMRP") in the draft EIR as explicitly
24 required by the County's own code of ordinances. And the County repeatedly underplayed
25 the impacts of the Project and failed to adopt adequate mitigation to address these impacts.
26 The EIR fails to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's myriad environmental effects,
27 including impacts on public safety due to significant wildfire risk, evacuation and
28 emergency response, water quality and water supply, potential impacts to neighbors' wells,
2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

1 local housing market impacts, noise impacts from the helipad as well as Project
2 construction and operation, traffic, and roadway hazards.

3 3. This petition challenges the Board of Supervisors' reliance on the EIR
4 prepared for the Project because the County failed to ensure that the EIR disclosed,
5 analyzed, and mitigated the Project's many foreseeable impacts as required by CEQA and
6 the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of Regulations, section 15000 et. seq. The
7 Project is also inconsistent with the County's General Plan and Zoning Ordinance,
8 designed to limit the impacts of commercial development and to protect significant natural
9 areas such as the Project site and its environs. For all these reasons and as further detailed
10 in this petition, the County's approval of the Project and certification of the EIR violate
11 CEQA and the Planning and Zoning Law and must be overturned.
12 PARTIES

13 4. Petitioner Save Sawmill Mountain is an unincorporated association of
14 residents of Tuolumne County who are committed to protecting the rural character and
15 natural resources of Tuolumne County, particularly those areas in close proximity to
16 Yosemite National Park. Members of Save Sawmill Mountain live and/or recreate in the
17 Sawmill Mountain/Hardin Flat area where the Project will be located, and they will be
18 adversely impacted by the Project.

19 5. Central Sierra Environmental Resource Center ("CSERC") is a California
20 nonprofit organization formed in 1991 to defend water and wildlife across the foothills and
21 forests of the Central Sierra Nevada from sprawling or inappropriate new development,
22 destruction of habitat, and other threats to open space or wild places. CSERC members
23 live, own property, and/or recreate in Tuolumne County and are affected by the Project.
24 For more than three decades CSERC has represented public benefit resources including
25 wildlife, water resources, and scenic values in the region. CSERC and its members are
26 directly, adversely, and irreparably affected, and will continue to be prejudiced by the
27 Project and its components, as described herein, until and unless this Court provides the
28 relief prayed for in this Petition. The interests that CSERC seeks to further in this action
3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

are within the purposes and goals of the organization, and CSERC and its members have a
2 direct and beneficial interest in Respondents' compliance with CEQA and the CEQA
Guidelines. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial
benefit on the public by protecting the public from the environmental and other harms
5 alleged herein.

6 6. Respondent County of Tuolumne, a political subdivision of the State of
7 California, is responsible for regulating and controlling land use in the unincorporated

8 territory of the County, including implementing and complying with the provisions of
9 CEQA. The County is the "lead agency" for the purposes of Public Resources Code

10 Section 21067, with principal responsibility for conducing environmental review of the
11 proposed actions. The County has a duty to comply with CEQA and other state laws.
12 7. Respondent County of Tuolumne Board of Supervisors is the duly elected
13| decision-making body of the County. As the decision-making body, the Board of
14| Supervisors is charged with the responsibilities under CEQA for conducting a proper
15 review of the proposed action's environmental impacts and granting the various approvals
16 necessary for the Project.
17 8. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents
18 fictitiously named Does through 20 and sue such respondents by fictitious names.
19 Petitioners are informed and believe, and on the basis of such information and belief,
20 allege the fictitiously named respondents are also responsible for the actions described in
21 this Petition. When the true identities and capacities of these respondents have been
22 determined, Petitioners will amend this Petition, with leave of the Court if necessary, to
23 insert such identities and capacities:

24 9. Real Party in Interest Terra Vi Yosemite Lodge is listed as the "Project
25 Proponent" on the County's December 31, 2020 Notice of Determination related to the
26 Project. Terra Vi Yosemite Lodge is named as a Real Party in Interest in this action
27 pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5(a).

28 10.. Petitioners are informed and on that basis allege that Real Party in Interest
4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

F Hansji Corporation will develop and operate the Terra Vi Lodge and wholly owns Terra Vi
2 Yosemite Lodge.

3 11. Real Party in Interest Hardin Flat LLC is identified in Project documents as

4 the owner of the property where the proposed Project would be constructed. As the

5 property owner, Hardin Flat LLC has a material interest in Respondents' approval of the
6 Project and is directly and materially affected by the actions challenged in this Petition.

7 12. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in
Interest Does 21 through 40 and sue such real parties in interest by fictitious names.
9 Petitioners are informed and believe, and based on such information and belief, allege that
10 the fictitiously named real parties in interest are directly and materially affected by the
11 actions, described in this Petition. When the true identities and capacities of these real
12 parties in interest have been determined, Petitioners will amend this Petition, with leave of
13 the Court if necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.
14 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

15 13. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged herein pursuant to Code
16 of Civil Procedures sections 526, 527, 1085, 1087, and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code
17 sections 21168 and 21168.5.

18 14. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of
19 California in and for the County of Tuolumne pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
20 394.

21 15. Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the
22  instant action and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the
23 extent possible and required by law. Petitioners submitted numerous objections to the
24 approvals for the Project and appealed the Planning Commission's approval of the Project
25 to the County Board of Supervisors.

26 16. Respondents have taken final agency actions with respect to certifying the
27 EIR and granting approvals for the Project. Respondents have a duty to comply with
28 applicable state laws, including but not limited to CEQA and the Planning and Zoning
5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

1 Law, prior to undertaking the discretionary approvals at issue in this lawsuit. Petitioners
2 possess no effective remedy to challenge the approvals at issue in this action other than by
3 means of this lawsuit.

4 17. On January 28, 2021, Petitioners complied with Public Resources Code

5 section 21167.5 by emailing and mailing to Respondents a letter stating that Petitioners
6 planned to file a Petition for Writ of Mandate seeking to invalidate Respondents' approvals

7 for the Project. Attached hereto as Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of this letter.

8 18. On January 28, 2021, Petitioners are complying with Public Resources Code

9 section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by furnishing the Attorney
10 General of the State of California with a copy of the Petition. Attached hereto as Exhibit B
11 is a true and correct copy of the letter transmitting the Petition to the Attorney General.
12 19. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6(b)(2), Petitioners elect to
13 prepare the record of proceedings in this action. Concurrently with this Petition, Petitioners
14 are filing a notice of election to prepare the administrative record.
15 20. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of
16 ordinary law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents
17 to set aside their certification of the EIR and approvals for the Project. In the absence of
18 such remedies, Respondents' approvals will remain in effect in violation of state law, and
19 the environment and Petitioners will be irreparably harmed. No money damages or legal
20 remedy could adequately compensate for that harm.

21 STATEMENT OF FACTS

22 21. The proposed Project entails construction of a large resort hotel consisting of
23. 126 guestrooms both in a lodge and cabin-style buildings, housing for 20 employees, a
24 public market, a helipad, and indoor and outdoor facilities designed to host over 500
25 people daily. Site development would cover at least 13 and as much as 19 acres and
26 includes 286 parking spaces. The Project would require construction of an on-site
27 wastewater treatment system and a graywater system, neither of which was described in
28 the draft EIR. Although it is located directly adjacent to Highway 120, the Project would
6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

1 rely on a small, undeveloped Forest Service Road as the primary access to the Project site.
2 The Project would also require the development of onsite wells sufficient to meet all
3 Project water demands, since no public water supply is accessible at this location. All of
4 this infrastructure would be constructed on an environmentally sensitive, currently
5 undeveloped natural site surrounded by rural residential and National Forest land.

6 22. The EIR describes the Project site as composed of two parcels, one zoned
7 primarily C-K for "commercial recreational" use and the other zoned partly C-K for
8 "commercial recreational" use and partly O for open space. However, a portion of the
western parcel, referred to as APN 068-120-060, also contains a parcel deeded from
10 Caltrans to Carol Manly, predecessor to Hardin Flat LLC, the current owner of the Project
11 site. At the time it was deeded to Carol Manly in 2003, the Caltrans parcel was zoned as a
12 timberland production district (TPZ). The Caltrans parcel was never rezoned for
13 commercial use.

14 23. Some areas of the Project site were severely burned in the 2013 Rim Fire.
15 After that fire in December 2015, Gregory Robert Manley, the agent for Hardin Flat LLC,
16 entered into a grant agreement with CAL FIRE, the state agency responsible for forestry
17 management, that resulted in the property owner receiving grant funding in the amount of
18 $34,000 to manage the property for forestry production and carbon sequestration. In
19 exchange, Manley agreed to keep the property in its status as commercial timberland and
20 not to develop the property for at least 10 years. Although this grant agreement would not
21 expire until 2025, the property owner abandoned any commitment to the agreement when
22 it proposed the Terra Vi project in 2018.
23 24. The County issued the Notice of Preparation for the EIR on May 2, 2019.
24 Because the County failed to file the NOP with the State Clearinghouse as required by
25 CEQA, it released the NOP again on November 15, 2019. In its comments on the NOP,
26 Save Sawmill Mountain expressed concern that the County's list of potentially significant
27 Project impacts did not address many impact areas and requested that the County conduct a
28 full review of the Project and alternatives.
7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

25. The County released the Notice of Availability for the draft EIR for the
2 Project on June 17, 2020 and provided just over 40 days-until July 30--for the
3 submission of public comments.

4 26. On the same day it released the Project draft EIR, the County also released
5 the draft EIR for the Yosemite Under Canvas project (a resort lodge operation designed to
6 accommodate at least 250 guests) which is located immediately across Highway 120 from

7 the Project. Because the time for public comment on the Project EIR overlapped with the
8 review period for the Under Canvas project, many members of the public requested an
9 extension of time so that they would have sufficient time to understand the impacts of both
10 projects and to inform the County of their concerns. Combined, the two EIRs totaled
11 thousands of pages of detailed written materials for citizen review. The County denied the
12 many requests for additional time for public review and also denied a request to extend the
13 comment period for the directly adjacent Yosemite Under Canvas project's EIR.
14 27. Notwithstanding the constraints imposed by the County's overlapping review
15 periods, Petitioners and others diligently participated in the County's administrative
16 process for the Project. Concerned citizens, Save Sawmill Mountain, and CSERC, along
17 with the Tuolumne River Trust, another well-established, local environmental
18 organization, submitted extensive comments on the draft EIR.

19 28. Comments submitted on the draft EIR raised concerns over the failure to
20 adequately evaluate the Project's significant impacts, in particular, impacts to surrounding
21 community, guests, and staff from severe wildfire risks as well as impacts related to traffic
22 safety, water quality and water supply, potential impacts to neighbors' wells, and the
23 additional strain the project would pose for already over-stretched and inadequate public
24 services (especially ambulance, law enforcement, and fire response) and for the local rental
25 housing market. Commenters criticized the draft EIR's inconsistent project description and
26 its failure to evaluate a reasonable range of project alternatives. Commenters also noted the
27 Project's many inconsistencies with the County General Plan's land use designation of
28 commercial recreation, which prohibits commercial development that is not connected to
8

CASENO.

1 public water and sewer services. Commenters also objected to the helipad and the draft
2 EIR's failure to evaluate the noise impacts of allowing helicopter takeoffs and landings in
3 close proximity to a rural residential area.

4 29. The County issued the final EIR on November 20, 2020-the Friday before
5 Thanksgiving-and set the Planning Commission hearing for the Project just 10 days later

6 on December 1, 2020. The final EIR made substantial modifications to the Project and its
7 environmental review that had not previously been disclosed to the public. Among other
8 changes, the Project was revised to include an on-site packaged wastewater treatment

9 system, it proposed moving the helipad, and it included a graywater sewage treatment
10 facility. The final EIR also included six new technical appendices with entirely new
11 environmental analyses that had been omitted from the draft EIR. The noise appendix
12 alone was over 80 pages in length, and, although it contained substantial new information,
13 it still failed to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's significant noise impacts. The
14 final EIR also omitted necessary information about the new wastewater treatment facility,
15 the proposed graywater system, and the proposal for treating water supply from the
16 Project. Notwithstanding this substantial new information and limited review time,
17 members of the public, including Save Sawmill Mountain, rushed to submit comments on
18 the final EIR.

19 30. Also on November 20, 2020, Patrick Koepele of the Tuolumne River Trust
20 emailed a copy of the Trust's comments on the draft EIR that had been previously
21 submitted on July 30, 2020 during the public comment period. Because the County had
22 failed to respond to the Trust's comments on the Under Canvas EIR, Mr. Koepele was
23 concerned that it would also overlook the Trust's comments on the Terra Vi project. Mr.
24 Koepele again raised his concern over the County's failure to respond to comments on the
25 Project EIR on November 24 and December 1, 2020. Notwithstanding his attempts to
26 bring this to the County's attention, the County never responded to the Trust's comments
27 on the draft EIR.

28 31. At its December 1 hearing on the Project, the Planning Commission heard
9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

1 testimony from residents throughout the County in opposition to the Project. An over-
2 whelming majority of commenters expressed concerns about the wildfire impacts of the
3 Project that would affect public safety, its impacts on water supply and quality, potential
4 impacts of the project to neighbors' wells, its traffic safety impacts, its noise impacts, the
inadequacy of public services, and the need to consider a better range of project

6 alternatives. Members of Save Sawmill Mountain and other members of the public also
7| objected that the Project was inconsistent with the County's General Plan and Zoning

8 Ordinance and that the County had failed to demonstrate that the Forest Service road relied

upon for Project access could legally be used to access the site. At that meeting, after
10 public testimony, Planning Commissioners approved the Project without modification.

11 32. On December 3, 2020, Clare Cosovich filed an appeal of the Planning
12 Commission's approval of the Project. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that
13 basis allege, that Ms. Cosovich is engaged to a member of the Manly family, which owns
14 the property where the Project will be located. Although Ms. Cosovich never submitted
15 comments on the Project and never objected to its approval, she asserted in her appeal that
16 the County had not demonstrated that adequate water supply existed for the Project. The
17 County set the hearing on her appeal for December 18, 2020.
18 33. Save Sawmill Mountain filed a separate appeal of the Planning
19 Commission's decision to the Board of Supervisors on December 11, 2020. The County
20 combined the Cosovich appeal with Save Sawmill Mountain's and scheduled the Board of
21 Supervisors' hearing on the appeals for December 29, 2020. Although the Cosovich appeal
22 is posted on the County's website, Save Sawmill Mountain's appeal is not.
23 34. Prior to the Board of Supervisor's hearing on the Project, on December 28,
24 2020, Save Sawmill Mountain submitted a letter elaborating on previous comments on
25 legal inadequacies in the EIR and detailing the final EIR's failure to adequately address
26 these issues. Among other deficiencies, Save Sawmill Mountain noted the EIR failed to
27 adequately analyze greenhouse gas impacts of the Project and improperly dismissed
28 mitigation as infeasible.
10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

1 35. At the December 29, 2020 hearing, many members of the public from
2 throughout Tuolumne County objected to the approval of the Project and continued to
3 press their concerns that the EIR had not adequately evaluated or mitigated project impacts

4 and that the Project was inconsistent with the County's General Plan and Zoning
5 Ordinance. Although Ms. Cosovich was permitted to appear at the hearing as an appellant,
6 she testified that she actually did not oppose the Project, and instead criticized those
7| objecting to the Project.

8 36. Petitioner CSERC testified that the County had failed to respond to its
9 comments on the draft EIR, even though those comments had been submitted during the
10 public comment period on the draft EIR. Following this comment, the Board took a "thirty
11 minute recess." When the Board came back after almost an hour, the Board chair
12 announced that the County had determined that CSERC was correct that the County had
13 failed to respond to CSERC's comments and that the hearing would be continued to
14 December 31, 2020. No vote was taken to continue the hearing.
15 37. On December 30, 2020 Save Sawmill Mountain submitted comments
16| objecting to the County's apparent discussion of the failure to respond to CSERC's
17 comments and continuance of the hearing in violation of the Brown Act. Save Sawmill
18 Mountain also noted that the County's action violated its obligation to provide a fair
19 hearing on the appeal as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5
20 38. The County posted responses to CSERC's comments on the draft EIR at 2:51
21 p.m. on December 30, 2020. Because the County's responses to CSERC's comments were
22 posted as "errata" less than 24 hours before the Board of Supervisors hearing on the
23 Project, CSERC did not have adequate time to fully review those responses, although
24 CSERC staff invested many hours into that effort. CSERC was not provided the
25 opportunity to file its own appeal of the Project or to obtain a fair hearing on that appeal
.26 before the Board.

27 39. At the December 31 hearing, which began at 9:00 a.m. the following
28 morning, the Board of Supervisors reopened the public hearing and took additional
11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

testimony from the public. Among those who objected to approval of the Project was the
2 Tuolumne River Trust, who discovered after hearing the testimony from CSERC on
3 December 29, 2020 that the County had also failed to respond to the Trust's comments on

4 the draft EIR, even though those comments had been initially submitted on July 30, 2020

5 during the public comment period on the draft EIR and resubmitted by the Trust twice,
6 once on November 20, 2020 and again on December 1, 2020.

7 40. After receiving the testimony from the Trust, the Board took an abrupt
8 recess, returning 30 minutes later to resume public testimony. At the close of public
9 testimony, the Board took another break and returned over an hour later. When the Board
10 resumed the hearing, County staff acknowledged that the County had failed to respond to
11 the Trust's comments on the draft EIR. However, County staff incorrectly asserted that the
12 comments had not been submitted until December 1, 2020 and therefore were untimely. As
13 the email correspondence between the Trust and the County clearly indicates, the
14 comments were first submitted on July 30, 2020 and only resubmitted in November and
15 again in December after the Trust learned that the County had failed to respond to its
16 comments on the adjacent Under Canvas project. Based on the County's misrepresentation
17 of the timing of the Trust's comments, the County asserted that it did not need to respond
18 to the Trust's comments, instead of continuing the hearing to allow for such responses to
19 be prepared and published, and to allow the Trust an opportunity to review those
20 comments and to prepare an appeal. Copies of the Trust's correspondence with the County,
21 including its original comments, are attached as Exhibit C.

22 41. Counsel for Save Sawmill Mountain attempted to correct the record, but the
23 County refused to hear further comments from appellant. Although the County prevented
24 appellants from providing additional information, it continued to allow the Project
25 proponent to present testimony throughout the remainder of the hearing.
26 42. At the December 31 hearing, some members of the Board of Supervisors
27 expressed concern over the Project's impacts on water supply, particularly its potential
28 effects on neighboring wells. One member also proposed eliminating the Project's helipad
12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

1 due to its significant noise impacts. However, staff discouraged the Board from making
2 changes to the Project, advising that the adequacy of the EIR rested upon the Board's
3 judgment that no additional mitigation was needed. At that point, the Project was

4 approved. The only modification from the Planning Commission's approval of the Project

5 was the inclusion of a measure regarding the Project's greenhouse gas emissions that had
6 not been included in the EIR and had only been proposed on December 29, 2020.

7 43. The County filed a Notice of Determination that same afternoon, on
8 December 31, 2020.

9 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

10 Violation of CEQA (Public Resources Code ยง 21000 et seq.)
11 44. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs in
12 their entirety.

13 45. CEQA is designed to ensure that government agencies incorporate the goal
14 of long-term protection of the environment into their decisions that may affect the

15 environment. CEQA applies to any discretionary action taken by an agency that may cause
16 a reasonably foreseeable change in the environment.

17 46. In furtherance of its goal of environmental protection, CEQA requires that an
18 agency prepare an EIR a for a project whenever substantial evidence in the record supports a
19 fair argument that the project may have a significant impact on the environment. As the
20 cornerstone of the CEQA process, the EIR must disclose and analyze a project's
21 potentially significant environmental impacts. In addition, the EIR also must inform
22 decision-makers and the public of feasible mitigation measures and alternative project
23 designs or elements that would lessen or avoid the project's significant adverse
24 environmental impacts.

25 47. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency adopt all feasible mitigation
26 I measures that would reduce or avoid any of the project's significant environmental
27 impacts. If any of the project's significant impacts cannot be mitigated to a less-than-
28 significant level, the project can be approved only if the agency finds that the project's
13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

1 benefits would outweigh its unavoidable impacts.

2 48. Under CEQA, all findings required for any agency's approval of a project
3 must be legally adequate and supported by substantial evidence in the administrative
4 record, and CEQA further requires that an agency provide an explanation of how the
5 evidence in the record supports the conclusions that the agency has reached.
49. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying an EIR for the Project that is
inadequate and fails to comply with the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.
8 The EIR's deficiencies include, but are not limited to, the following:

9 d. The EIR relies on an inconsistent and inadequate project description
10 that, among other legal deficiencies, omits key elements of the Project, including the
11 wastewater treatment facility, the helipad, and the water supply treatment system, fails to
12 acknowledge the cancellation of the CAL FIRE grant agreement and the associated
13 conversion of the site from commercial timberland use, and fails to properly describe the
14 number of employees necessary a to support the Project. As a result of this inadequate and
15 inconsistent project description, the EIR fails to properly identify significant project
16 impacts, mitigation measures, and alternatives. For example, the EIR's project description
17 substantially underestimates the number of employees needed for the Project and therefore
18 underestimates housing impacts, water quality and water supply impacts, traffic impacts,
19 and wildfire safety impact, among others.

20 b. The EIR fails to adequately analyze the Project's significant wildfire

21 and fire safety impacts. Among other legal flaws, the EIR improperly includes mitigation
22 measures and conditions of Project approval as part of its project description in order to

23 find that the Project will have no significant impacts on wildfire and fire safety, even

24 though the Project will bring hundreds of people to an area designated as a Very High a Fire
25 Hazard Severity Zone and will increase the risk of fire ignition through ignition sparks, fire
26 pits, smoking by guests, and potential ignitions due to sparking from vehicles and
27 equipment. As a result, the EIR fails in its role as an informational document, and it fails to

28 identify all feasible mitigation measures necessary to address the Project's wildfire and

CASE NO.

- safety impacts.

2 C. The EIR fails to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impacts
3 on emergency access, evacuation, and emergency response. Although evacuation during

4

5 wildfire events has become a significant factor in the ability to save lives, the EIR provides

6 a only a cursory evaluation of this issue. For example, the EIR assumes no impact to
emergency evacuation would occur--in part because the Project has access to Highway
7 120 via Forest Service Route 1S03. However, the County has no jurisdiction over roads in
8 the Forest Service system and federal regulations preclude the use of such roads for
commercial development. Even if Route 1S03 were available as an evacuation route, the
10 EIR still fails to determine whether an adequate evacuation opportunity exists, including
11 basic questions such as whether the road capacity is sufficient for the number of people
12 evacuating, the amount of time necessary to implement a full evacuation, and whether that
13 time period is acceptable to ensure the safety of Project guests,
14 residents in the area, and
other users of Highway 120 who will be also be evacuating at the same time in the event of
15a wildfire or other emergency.
16 d.

17 The EIR fails to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impacts
on water supply. For example, despite detailed public comments underscoring the
18 unreliability of wells in fractured bedrock during drought periods or critical dry water
19 years, the EIR's analysis was based on a few weeks of monitoring conducted outside of the
20 monitoring time period established by the State Water Resources Control Board, and after
21 a year of above average rainfall. As a result, the EIR could not adequately characterize the
22 environmental conditions that prevail in the Project area, nor could it accurately assess the
23 effect that groundwater pumping for the Project will have on existing groundwater supplies
24 and surrounding wells during a critical dry water year or during multiple dry years in a
25 prolonged drought period. Project planning documents do not discuss any alternative water
26 supply as a backup in the event that Project wells prove inadequate. Furthermore, above
27 and beyond the potential for minimally tested Project wells to fail during multiple dry
28 water years, the EIR failed to accurately assess the significant cumulative effects of

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 15

CASE NO.

1 simultaneous groundwater pumping by the Project and the Under Canvas project's wells,

2 which in combination could draw down or cause the failure of nearby currently existing
3 wells of Project neighbors. Because the EIR failed to identify the Project's potentially
4 significant impacts on water supply and impacts to the wells on adjacent properties, it
5 failed to propose mitigation necessary to address those impacts.

6 e. The EIR fails to adequately analyze or mitigate significant noise
7 impacts, including the failure to adequately characterize the existing noise environment
8 and the failure to identify sensitive receptors and to measure how noise levels from the

9 Project would affect these receptors. The EIR fails entirely to provide an adequate analysis
10 of noise impacts from the helipad and simply assumes the noise impacts will be significant
11 and unavoidable without making any serious attempt to explain for the public what those
12 impacts would be. The EIR also fails to evaluate the impact of the Project in degrading the
13 exceptionally quiet ambient noise conditions that currently exist at the Project site. The
14 Project in combination with the Under Canvas project directly across the street would
15 cause a highly significant increase in noise that was not considered as a cumulative impact.
16 f. The EIR fails to adequately analyze or mitigate significant traffic and
17 traffic safety impacts. Among other deficiencies, the draft EIR failed to include any
18 analysis of vehicle miles traveled, deferring that legally mandated analysis to the final EIR.
19 The analysis that was ultimately conducted failed to capture all traffic from the Project and
20 underestimated vehicle miles traveled for many of the same reasons that the initial traffic
21 analysis was inadequate.
22 g. The EIR fails to adequately analyze or mitigate significant air quality

23 and climate change impacts, including the failure to account for the impacts from Project
24 traffic, construction and operations, and the impacts associated with the cancellation of the
25 CALFIRE reforestation and GHG reduction grant agreement.

26 h. The EIR fails to adequately analyze or mitigate water quality impacts,
27 in particular impacts from the onsite treatment of millions of gallons of Project wastewater
28 each year and the impacts of the Project's leach fields on neighboring wells and water
16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE.
CASE NO.

quality. This failure is compounded by the failure to consider the cumulative discharge of
2 treated effluent by the Project in combination with the discharge of millions of gallons per
3 year of additional treated septic effluent by the Under Canvas project adjacent to the
4 Project. The EIR also fails to consider the potential effects of Project wastewater discharge

5 on water quality in the Tuolumne River.

6 i. The EIR fails to adequately analyze housing impacts and impacts to
7| public services, including emergency response services. In addition to underestimating the

8 number of Project employees, the EIR fails to adequately assess impacts from the

9 employees it claims will be needed for the Project. The EIR improperly dismisses impacts
10 that would result from further adding to the already significant delays in emergency
11 response times and exacerbating strain on over-stretched public services, both of which
12 would affect the physical environment.
13 j. The EIR fails to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impacts
14 on biological resources, including impacts to sensitive species and wetlands.
15 k. The EIR fails to adequately analyze or mitigate significant cumulative
16 impacts, including but not limited to water quality and water supply, fire and fire safety, air
17 quality and greenhouse gas emissions, traffic and traffic safety, and noise. The Project is
18 just one of a number of new or expanded developments along the Highway 120 corridor,
19 yet the EIR dismisses the significance of the Project's cumulative impacts both by
20 underestimating impacts from the Project itself and by failing to evaluate how these
21 impacts will combine with those from other projects to impact the environment.
22 I. The EIR improperly defers analysis and mitigation of Project impacts,
23 including:

24 i. reliance on a future emergency evacuation protocol that fails to
25 include enforceable performance standards or to ensure safe evacuation in the event of an
26 emergency;
27 ii. reliance on an inadequate and uncertain plan for addressing
28 emergency response times;
17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

iii. reliance on a "Wildland Fire Protection Plan" consisting of

2 vague and otherwise unenforceable measures;

3 iv. deferral of mitigation for water quality impacts, including those
4 related to stormwater runoff and drainage;

5 V. deferral of mitigation for traffic safety impacts, including those
6 related to sight lines and project egress;

7 vi. reliance on federal and state agencies to assess the impacts of
8 the helipad and a proposal to relocate the helipad, if feasible, that is undefined and
9 unenforceable; and

10 vii. reliance on the claim that the Project will comply with state
11 and local regulatory standards without providing any evidence that compliance with such
12 standards is feasible.

13 50. Respondents violated CEQA by failing to analyze a reasonable range of
14 project alternatives and by improperly rejecting feasible alternatives that would reduce the
15 Project's significant environmental impacts.
16 51. Respondents violated CEQA by failing to recirculate the EIR after adding
17 substantial new information and changes to the Project after the draft EIR was circulated
18 for public review.

19 52. Respondents violated CEQA by failing to adequately respond to comments

20 on the EIR, including, but not limited to, failing to respond entirely to comments of the
21 Tuolumne River Trust, only responding to CSERC's comments on the eve of the Board of
22 Supervisor's December 31, 2020 hearing on the Project, and by ignoring or rotely
23 dismissing comments by concerned citizens that identified flaws in the County's analysis,
24 requests for additional information, and suggestions of feasible mitigation measures and
25 alternatives.

26 53. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting inadequate findings. The County's
27 findings do not provide adequate reasoning or the analytic route from facts to conclusions,
28 as required by law. The County also failed to adopt findings regarding the Project's
18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

1 reliance on Forest Route1S03, which is under the jurisdiction of another agency.

2 54. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
3 discretion by certifying an EIR that does not comply with the requirements of CEQA and
4 precluded informed decision-making. As such, Respondents' certification of the EIR and
5 approval of the Project must be set aside.

6 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

7 Violation of State Planning and Zoning Law

8 55. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs in
9 their entirety.

10 56. Government Code section 65300 et. seq. requires the legislative body of each
11 county to adopt a general plan for the physical development of the unincorporated areas of
12 the county. The general plan must contain a statement of development policies, one or
13 more diagrams, and text setting forth objectives, principles, standards, and plan proposals,
14 and it must include mandatory elements. The general plan serves as a charter for future
15 development to which all other land use decisions must conform.

16 57. A conditional use permit and/or a site development permit must be consistent
17 with the County's General Plan.

18 58. The Project is inconsistent with the policies in the County General Plan
19 designed to minimize fire hazards, limit noise impacts, and require that commercial
20 development be connected to public utilities. For example, General Plan Policy 3.A.2
21 requires "new commercial development to be served by public water systems, except for
22 development in areas designated as Special Commercial on the General Plan land use
23 diagrams." The Project is indisputably a commercial development, but the Project site is
24 not designated as Special Commercial, and so the development is required to be served by
25 a public water system. The water system proposed for the Project does not meet the
26 definition of a public water system as defined by the County Code.
27 59. Violation of the requirement that the Project use be consistent with zoning
28 for the Project site. Because the Caltrans parcel has never been rezoned for commercial use
19
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

1 under the rezoning procedures required by County Code Chapter 17.70, section 17.06.020,

2 or section 17.42.080, the parcel retains its timberland production district (TPZ) zoning and
3 the Project is not consistent with the zoning for that portion of the site.

4 60. Respondents' approval of the Project therefore violates the requirements of

5 state law and is thus arbitrary and capricious and a prejudicial abuse of discretion. Because

6 Respondents did not proceed in the manner required by law and their decision was not
7 supported by substantial evidence, the approval of the Project should be set aside.

8 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

9 (Violation of Code of Civil Procedure ยง 1094.5)

10 61. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs in
11 their entirety.

12 62. Code of Civil Procedure section 1904.5 requires that the County provide a
13 fair hearing on Save Sawmill Mountain's appeal. The County violated this requirement by
14 repeatedly failing to provide the public notice and opportunity to comment required by
15 law, rushing to approve the Project before the end of 2020 when a new Board of
16 Supervisors would be seated, refusing to respond to comments submitted by members of
17 the Tuolumne River Trust, responding to CSERC's comments in late afternoon on the day
18 before the Board of Supervisors hearing on the Project, and depriving petitioners and other
19 members of the public of an adequate opportunity to review these comments and
20 responses, and by refusing to allow appellants the opportunity to speak on matters raised
21 by the Board while allowing the Project applicant to speak at the hearing.

22 63. The County also denied CSERC's rights to appeal and to a fair hearing by
23 posting its responses to CSERC's initial comments less than 24 hours before the Board of
24 Supervisors hearing on the Project. Due to the County's untimely last-minute responses,
25 CSERC was not given adequate time to review those responses or to prepare an appeal.
26 CSERC was effectively denied the opportunity to file its own appeal of the Project or to
27 obtain a fair hearing of that appeal before the Board.

1 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of County Code)

3 64. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs in
4 their entirety.

5 65. Tuolumne County Code section 17.72.220 provides that "[m]onitoring
6 and/or reporting plans for projects for which an EIR is prepared shall be included in the
7 draft EIR. The plan shall be subject to the same public review and comment afforded to all

8 other portions of the EIR." (emphasis added).
66. The draft EIR for the Project failed to include an MMRP as required by
10 County code section 17.72.220.

11 67. The Project approval violates sections 17.06.020 and 17.06.060 of the
12 County Code. Because the Caltrans' parcel has never been rezoned for commercial use, the
13 Project is not consistent with the timberland production zoning for that portion of the
14 Project site.

15 68. By failing to include an MMRP in the DEIR, the County violated its own
16 code and deprived the public of a full opportunity to review and comment on the MMRP
17 along with the rest of the DEIR.

18 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

19 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:
20 1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to

Current geological technology is inadequate to accurately assess or predict exactly where subsurface
water in fractured bedrock lies beneath the soil surface. The DEIR, states that the Terra Vi property and
the adjacent Yosemite Under Canvas property are "on different sides of a watershed boundary and likely
accessing different fracture zones." (page 4.16-7). This is not accurate. The Terra Vi property actually
a straddles the ridge, with a portion of the property sloping away to the north, and the remainder sloping
towards the Yosemite Under Canvas property to the south. Regardless, it is speculation to state that the
fracture zones beneath the two properties are distinct because they are on opposite sides of a
watershed boundary.

In fact, the DEIR does observe that onsite well-pumping impacts were observable in onsite and offsite
monitoring wells to the north. One would expect these impacts to be more exacerbated during
sequential dry years.

Additionally, although the DEIR states average annual rainfall, it makes no estimate of natural recharge
of the area's groundwater and it is therefore impossible to assess whether natural recharge is sufficient
to meet ongoing, year-round operations proposed by this project. In reality, there is very little upslope areas that would act as a recharge basin, a SO local recharge may be truly limited.
Furthermore, the well pumping tests were conducted in 2019, a very wet water year with 125% of average precipitation in the San Joaquin Basin (of which the Tuolumne Watershed is a subwatershed).
The pumping tests do not provide an assessment of what groundwater conditions would be like during
sequential dry or critically dry years.
There is no secondary water supply backup as an option at the project site. If the project's wells fail
during a drought or during a year that has low overall precipitation, the project cannot simply shift to
connect to the closest public water system, as was the solution for some sites with well failures during the recent multi-year drought. There is no close-by public water system available to connect to because this project and the neighboring Terra Vi Lodge proposal are leap-frog development far from public
water or sewer.

No mitigation measures are proposed for groundwater usage because the DEIR erroneously concludes
no significant impacts to groundwater. We disagree. Based on these facts described above, we believe
that the projects impacts to groundwater supply would be significant.
The final DEIR should fully acknowledge that there is currently no solid evidence that during multiple dry
water years or during a severe drought that the pumping of wells from the project site will be adequate
to supply water to the Terra Vi project at a rate sufficient to meet water demands of the up to nearly
550 occupants on site, plus additional visitors to the market and restaurants, restrooms, kitchen,
laundry, etc.

The final DEIR should also acknowledge that numerous DEIR statements purportedly describing the
adequacy of the project's water supply are speculative assertions based upon unproven conjecture rather than factual evidence, and that in reality the limited water testing of wells to date does not

provide grounds for the County to approve project wells as proven sufficient water supply - especially
since there iS no backup water supply alternative option.

3. HYD-1, HYD-3, HYD-5 - Water Quality concerns for the proposed project are significant in scope
and represent a significant impact to the environment. The project proposes a number of features,
including onsite sewage management through a septic system, many new, hardened structures and
surfaces, etc. that, in combination, will generate significant additional runoff carrying pollutants
downslope and downstream. The project site is situated atop the ridge dividing the South Fork and
Middle Fork of the Tuolumne River. Any water, pollutants, sediment, sewage, etc generated at the
project site will make its way downhill by force of gravity and has the potential to enter the Tuolumne
River and/or groundwater.

Additional hardened surfaces will increase the amount of water that moves downhill rather than
infiltrating groundwater areas. This has the double-impact of a) decreasing groundwater recharge; and
b) increasing runoff and pollutants entering waterways. This is a significant impact. The project
proponents have not proposed mitigation sufficient to address these impacts.

Furthermore, the overall size of the project that will accommodate tens of thousands of guests and
employees each year will generate significant amounts of human waste. Due to the remote location of
the project site, the project cannot connect with municipal utilities and wastewater treatment facilities.
As such, the project proposes to rely on septic systems and associated leach fields to handle the waste.
The DEIS does not provide sufficient assessment of how the effluent from the septic system may impact
groundwater, which is a source of drinking water for nearby homes. The Highway 120 Corridor Soils
Report is not actually report. Rather, it is a 1-page statement with minimal information about design
guidelines or limits to allow the public to understand what the site may or may not be able to
accommodate. As such, this report is insufficient and the opinion that the site can accommodate the
black water generated by the project is impossible to judge.

There is serious potential for the project to pollute nearby drinking water wells of adjacent properties.
Additionally, runoff from septic effluent may make its way downstream to the Tuolumne River, pollute
the river and cause algal blooms. This represents a significant impact.

4. PS-9, PS-10, PS-11, PS-12 - Impacts to Recreational Facilities. The DEIS states that impacts to
park and recreational facilities will be less than significant because there will be a limited number of full
time employees (33). While it may be true that the addition of 33 FTEs for operations of this project will
not significantly impact recreational resources, the true impact will come from the potential demand
that up to 556 guests per day, or up to nearly 196,000 guests per year, place on nearby recreation
resources within the Stanislaus National Forest and Yosemite National Park.

The DEIS states that incorrectly states that the proposed project would simply accommodate people
who are already planning to visit the area, and would therefore not represent an increase in visitor use.
This is speculative. Furthermore, many of the people who do visit the area generally pass through on
their way to Yosemite rather than stopping and lodging at this particular location, which is close to river

access points along the Middle and South Forks of the Tuolumne, most of which are undeveloped,
fishing and swimming holes. Of the 100,000-200,000 thousand guests staying at Terra Vi each year, a
significant number will not only wish to enter Yosemite National Park, but also explore the nearby
recreational opportunities along the rivers and forests to fish, swim, bike, hike, and enjoy other
recreational activities. The Stanislaus National Forest has very limited developed recreational facilities in
this locations and they are completely unprepared to handle a significant influx in visitor usage. Just over
the past few months of summer during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Stanislaus National Forest (and
indeed National Forest across the country) have experienced significant increase in visitation and stress
on their facilities.
This lodging facility is highly likely to encourage and enable additional uses of nearby National Forest
lands. The DEIS significantly underestimates this impact. In reality this will be a very significant impact,
especially when considered cumulatively with the adjacent Yosemite Under Canvas and Thousand
Trails/Yosemite Lake RV Expansion. The DEIS inadequately assesses these impacts. This is a significant
impact.

Conclusion
The issues of water, wastewater, and recreation have not been properly addressed, nor have sufficient
mitigation measures been considered and incorporated in the project. The County must require these
issues be addressed prior to finalizing the EIR.

Natalie and Quincy - checking in with you again. It appears that my Terra Vi comments were not included. I'd like to register my disappointment in how comments are handled. The county can
and should do better.

Natalie and Quincy this is extremely disappointing. After putting in the time and effort and
submitting comments on time, it is upsetting that our comments weren't given proper consideration. It seems incumbent upon the county to ensure that its firewall isn't weeding out properly submitted comments. I have been away this week but I see the news reports that the project was approved despite many opposing comments. I also understand that there were no adjustments or new mitigation measures required to mitigate the significant impacts of the project. This is very upsetting to learn.

In addition to the Under Canvas comments, I submitted comments on the Terra Vi project within
the comment period deadline. I will forward my copy of that email separately. Can you please confirm receipt of those comments?

Thank you,

Good morning Patrick,

We have had IT look into this issue and it appears that the emails you have sent Quincy and I have been blocked and marked as spam. This email is the only one that I have received from you. The previous email and email sent on July 20 did not come through and did not show up in my
Junk Email folder.

We have reviewed your comments and are working on a response to a them. You should expect a response from Quincy or later today. In the future, I am not sure if there is another email that you can use to send comments from as it appears that this address is being blocked by the County's firewall. I typically respond via email letting you know that I have received the
comments.

Natalie,

timely submitted comments on the Under Canvas DEIR on July 20, but find no record of them in the FEIR information posted on the website.

I attach my comments again here and will forward my email to you containing my comments
separately.

I request the meeting be postponed and my comments be given due consideration.

Thank you,
