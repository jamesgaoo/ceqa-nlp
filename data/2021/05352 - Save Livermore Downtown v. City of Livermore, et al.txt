ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Petitioner Save Livermore Downtown alleges as follows:

2 INTRODUCTION

1. This Petition challenges the actions taken by the City of Livermore and the

4 Livermore City Council ("City Council") (collectively, "the City") to approve Real Party in

5 Interest Eden Housing, Inc.'s ("Eden Housing") application for Downtown Design Review and
6 Vesting Tentative Parcel Map to develop the western portion of the Downtown Core site in
7 Livermore's Downtown Specific Plan area with 130 apartment units (the "Project").

8 2. The site on which the Project would be developed ("Project Site") lies within the
9 Downtown Core, an area subject to a revitalization strategy by the City that is set to be a focal
10 point of Downtown. This area has been subject to historical contamination as a result of past

11 commercial and industrial uses. The City and various stakeholders for years have considered

12 how to best reuse the Project Site and the Downtown Core site more generally.

13 3. As a center point of the City, the Project must comply with the Downtown
14 Specific Plan and adhere to the design policies of the City. Despite the importance of the Project
15 Site to the City and the residents of Livermore, the City has improperly rushed through and
16 approved Eden Housing's Project, without regard to the numerous inconsistencies the Project has
17 with the Downtown Specific Plan.

18 4. In addition, the City has failed to consider recent concerns raised by the San

19 Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board ("Regional Board") regarding the
20 historical contamination at the Project Site, particularly as to soil and groundwater contamination

21 and the presence of soil vapor intrusion. Soil vapor intrusion the release of gas from toxic

22 chemical in groundwater or soil under the surface rising out of the ground-is a serious cause for
23 concern, particularly at a site meant for housing. Despite these issues, the City unlawfully
24 determined that no additional environmental review of the Project was required and that the
25 Project was exempt from further analysis under the California Environmental Quality Act
26| ("CEQA"). To do this, the City improperly relied on one statutory exemption and three
27 categorical exemptions-none of which properly apply here.

1 5. Save Livermore Downtown wishes to see this Project Site developed to its highest
2 and best use. To that end, it has proposed to the City an alternative plan for affordable housing
3 that would preserve the Project Site for an expansive, amenity-filled public park, and still ensure
4 that critically needed and important affordable housing is developed. The City has refused to
5 give any consideration to this alternative plan, despite its support among Livermore residents.

6 Instead, the City has continued to force the unwanted Project on the site, culminating in the

7 City's unlawful approval for Downtown Design Review and Vesting Tentative Parcel Map for
8 the Project.

6. The City's approval of the Project is an abuse of discretion because the Project is
10 inconsistent with Livermore's Downtown Specific Plan and because further environmental
11 review is required to address newfound concerns regarding contamination at the Project Site.
12 Therefore, this Court should set aside the City's approval of the Project and require the City to
13 prepare further environmental analysis for the Project, a such as a supplemental environmental
14 impact report ("EIR"). In addition, this Court should require the City and Eden Housing to
15  resolve the Project's inconsistencies with the Downtown Specific Plan.

16 PARTIES

17 7. Petitioner Save Livermore Downtown is a public interest community organization
18 comprised of residents and business people in and around Livermore. Save Livermore

19 a Downtown is dedicated to a vision of the heart of the City that would improve the quality of life
20 for the whole community.

21 8. Respondent City of Livermore is a municipal corporation organized and existing
22 under the laws of the State of California. The City is the agency charged with the authority of
23 regulating and administering land use and development within its jurisdictional boundaries in

24 compliance with the provision of its General Plan and zoning ordinances as well as applicable
25 provisions of state law including the Planning and Zoning Law and CEQA.

26 9. Respondent Livermore City Council is the duly elected legislative body of the

27 City.

28

1 10. Real Party in Interest Eden Housing is a non-profit corporation incorporated in the
2 State of California that seeks to develop the Project.

3 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4 11. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to sections 1085 and 1094.5

5 of the Code of Civil Procedure and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

6 This Court also has jurisdiction to enforce the State Planning and Zoning Law, Government
7 Code sections 65000 et seq., and local planning and zoning rules. The Court has jurisdiction to

8 issue injunctions under Code of Civil Procedure section 526, and is otherwise authorized to grant
9 the relief prayed for herein.

10 12. Venue lies in the Alameda County Superior Court because the City is located in
11 Alameda County, and the City is the principal place of all events at issue. (See Code of Civ.
12 Proc., §§ 393 and 394.)

13 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

14 Project Site Background

15 13. The Project Site is approximately two acres in net size and is located at the at
16 southeast corner of L Street and Railroad Avenue in downtown Livermore. It is situated within
17 the Downtown Core Site, which consists of nine parcels, as approved by the City Council on
18 October 26, 2020. The Project Site is bounded to the west by L Street, to the north by Railroad
19 Avenue, to the south by Veterans Way, and to the east by Stockmen's Park and yet-to-be-
20 developed parcels.

21 14. The Project Site has a General Plan land use designation of Downtown Area. It is
22 located within Subarea 4 -Special Condition Sub-District D of the Downtown Core of the
23 Downtown Specific Plan, which establishes the site's zoning.

24 15. Former uses of the Project Site include a commercial center, which housed
25 Lucky's Supermarket, and the Southern Pacific Railroad Depot, which was relocated to the
26 Livermore Transit Center in July 2017.

27 16. The Downtown Core siteincluding the Project Site has historically had heavy

28 commercial and industrial uses. For example, historical uses at the Project Site include multiple
4
LATHAM&WATKINSw
ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
ANGELES

railroad lines, a railroad depot building, and lumber storage yard. Other historical uses nearby

2 include former dry cleaner operations (J Cleaners and Quality Cleaners), auto body operations,
fuel storage, and machine shops.

4 17. The hazardous materials accompanying these uses has led to contamination of the

5 Project Site. For example, former railroad operations have impacted soil and groundwater with

6 heavy metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, pesticides, and other chemicals of concern.

7 18. Because the Project Site was previously subject to heavy industrial uses, the
8 Regional Board now manages cleanup at the site due to the historical contamination.
9 City Purchase And Initial Environmental Review Of The Project Site

10 19. The Livermore Downtown Specific Plan and EIR were initially adopted by the
11 City Council in 2004. The Downtown Specific Plan identified the Project Site and nearby
12 parcels within the Livermore Village Site (also referred to as the Downtown Core Site) as part of

13 its overall revitalization strategy.

14 20. The Livermore Village Site consists of approximately 5.8 acres of land. The

15 properties that make up the site were acquired for redevelopment by the City and the former-
16 | Redevelopment Agency of the City of Livermore (the "former RDA"). Save Livermore
17 Downtown is informed and believes that between approximately 2007 and 2012, the properties

18 were transferred between the City and the former RDA through a number of transactions.
19 Ultimately, when the State dissolved the former RDA, the California Department of Finance
20 authorized the Livermore Village Site properties to be transferred to the City as governmental
21 purpose properties and as housing assets.

22 21. Consistent with the Downtown Specific Plan and the former RDA's plans, the

23 goal was to assemble the properties for a project to create retail and office space, community
24 amenities, and affordable housing opportunities.

25 22. In 2009, the City adopted a Downtown Specific Plan Amendment and certified a
26 subsequent EIR ("2009 EIR") for the Downtown Core Site. As relevant here, at a general
27 | program-level the EIR recommended various mitigation measures for the Downtown Core Site,

28 which encompasses the Project Site: (1) preparation of a Soil Management Plan prior to the
5
LATHAM•WATKINSwP
ATTORNEYG AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
LOS ANGELES

1 issuance of grading permits; (2) preparation of a hazardous building materials survey to address

2 loose and peeling lead-based paint and asbestos-containing material; and (3) preparation and
3 implementation of a soil and/or groundwater investigation workplan by a licensed professional to
4 evaluate operation of the Southern Pacific Railroad and Quality Cleaners. The 2009 EIR

5 concluded that, with implementation of the mitigation measures, potential impacts from

6 hazardous materials would be less than significant.

7 Eden Housing, The Project Site, And The Project

8 23. In January 2018, the City Council approved a plan for redeveloping the

0 Downtown Core Site (the former Lucky's Site and hotel site on the east side of South Livermore
10 Avenue and west of the Bankhead Theater) that includes public park space, commercial retail

11 buildings, cultural facilities, multifamily workforce housing, a public parking garage, and a

12 boutique hotel. A true and correct copy of that plan is attached hereto as Exhibit A.
13 24. Based on the Downtown Core Plan, the Downtown Core Site-including the
14 Project Site is intended to be the focal point for the City of Livermore. It is literally the center
15 of downtown Livermore. As depicted on Exhibit A, the original vision for the multifamily
16 workforce housing component of the Downtown Core Plan would have included four distinct
17 residential buildings surrounding a new Veterans Park.

18 25. In May 2018, the City issued a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) to identify a
19 qualified developer for the housing component of the City's Downtown Core Plan.

20 26. City staff selected Eden Housing to develop the multifamily housing component

21 for the Downtown Core Plan.

22 27. On or about November 1, 2018, the City executed a Disposition, Development,
23 and Loan Agreement ("DDLA") with Eden Housing. The DDLA also provided Eden Housing
24 with $500,000 in City Affordable Housing Trust Funds to complete predevelopment work,

25 design the project, and secure necessary entitlements, such as design review approval.

26 28. In October 2020, the Council adopted Resolution 2020-177, approving a new
27 Vesting Tentative Tract Map for the Downtown Core Site. The new map divided the site into
28

LATHAM&WATKINSw
ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
LOS ANGELES

nine distinct parcels. The proposed Eden Housing Project would be located on the northwestern
2 portion of the approved map.

3 29. On December 7, 2020, Eden Housing presented its proposed site plan for the

4 Project at a Special City Council Workshop Meeting. Notably, the site plan presented by Eden

5 Housing at this meeting deviated substantially from the Council-approved Downtown Core Plan
6 from January 2018. The new site plan showed two massive buildings-one along Railroad
7 Avenue and one along Veterans Way--that would create a wall-like effect through the literal
8 center of downtown Livermore, overwhelming the park between them and creating visual blight

9 for this very important property,
10 30. Overall, the Project would redevelop the Project site with 130 affordable
11 residential units. Despite the City and Eden previously promising to provide workforce housing
12 units at up to 120 percent of Alameda County Area Median Income ("AMI'), which could be
13 made available for teachers, police officers, and fire fighters, the Project ultimately proposed by
14 Eden Housing would include residential units that could be rented to individuals with incomes of
15 20 to 60 percent of AMI, for which teachers, police officers, and fire fighters would not qualify.
16 The residential units would be located within two overscaled, four-story buildings that resemble
17 giant walls.
18 Subsequent Environmental Issues At The Project Site

19 31. After the certification of the 2009 EIR for the Downtown Specific Plan, the City
20 Council later adopted three addenda to the EIR in March 2019, August 25, 2020, and August 27,
21 2020, respectively. As relevant here, the March 2019 Addendum concluded that no new impacts
22 regarding hazardous materials had occurred since the 2009 EIR.

23 32. In addition, the August 27, 2020 Addendum noted that since the March 2019
24 Addendum, the Regional Board initiated two Cleanup Program Sites. However, the August 27
25 Addendum did not specifically address remediation at the Project Site.
26 33. However, more recent information regarding the Project Site presented to the

27 Regional Board makes clear that the City should have, and was required to, engage in
28 supplemental or subsequent environmental review before approving the Project. The Regional
7
LATHAMSWATKINSw
ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
LO8 ANGELES

1 Board has expressed concerns and raised issues related to contamination at the site, particularly

2 regarding soil vapor intrusion.

3 34. For example, on February 9, 2021, Regional Board staff issued a letter to the City
4 approving an April 18, 2020, Site Assessment and Summary Report and a May 22, 2020, Site
5 History Technical Report. The February 9 letter from Regional Board staff concluded that

6 "[r]esults of investigations conducted since 2009 identified select metals in soil, petroleum
7 hydrocarbons in soil and groundwater, and volatile organic compounds, including
8 tetrachloroethene (PCE) and its breakdown products, in groundwater and soil vapor." (Exhibit
9 B.)

10 35. As a result, the Regional Board requested that the City submit a Data Gap
11 | Assessment Workplan and an Interim Remedial Action Plan. As part of these plans, the City is
12 required to engage in further data collection, summarize the results of the investigation and data
13 collection, and "describe the remedial alternatives evaluated, remedial alternative selected, and
14 proposed implementation method and timeframe." (Exhibit B.)

15 36. Furthermore, on May 7, 2021, PANGEA Environmental Services, Inc.
16 ("PANGEA") prepared a Data Gap Assessment Workplan for the Project Site. It concluded that

17 perchloroethylene ("PCE"), a noted chemical of concern that is very dangerous to human health
18 and very challenging and expensive to remediate, "has been detected in soil gas and groundwater
19 above Tier 1 screening levels, which merits further characterization and possible mitigation and
20 or/remediation with respect to prospective development at the site." (Exhibit C.) The Data Gap

21 Workplan further concludes that the presence of "arsenic and lead impact in shallow soil merits
22 further characterization," that a "PCE source could be present near the historic railroad lines
23 based on the highest PCE impact in shallow soil gas," and that "PCE in soil gas represents a
24| potential vapor intrusion concern for future development." (Ibid.)

25 The City's Unlawful Approval Of The Project

26 37. Notwithstanding these ongoing environmental and contamination concerns, as

27 well as an objective poll conducted by David Binder Research showing that the Livermore
28 community overwhelmingly opposed the Project by a 4 to margin, Eden Housing and the City
8
LATHAM+WATKINSw
ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
$ ANGELES

1 moved forward with the Project. On April 20, 2021, the City's Planning Commission considered
2 Eden Housing's application for Downtown Design Review and Vesting Tentative Parcel Map to
3 develop the Project.

4 38. At the time of the Planning Commission's consideration of the Project, Eden

5 Housing had requested multiple parking-related deviations from relevant City parking rules and

6 regulations as allowed pursuant to the State Density Bonus Law, Government Code section
7 65915, for (1) off-site unit parking; (2) a reduction in unit parking space quantity; (3) a reduction
8 in compact parking space dimensions; and (4) a reduction in standard parking space width. The

9 Project, however, was inconsistent with the Downtown Specific Plan and other relevant City
10 rules in several other ways, none of which had been addressed by the City or Eden Housing.

11 39. At the April 20, 2021 Planning Commission hearing regarding the Project,
12 opponents raised many issues related to the conformity of the Project with the Downtown
13 Specific Plan, noting that the Project violated the Specific Plan's development standards and
14 mandatory design standards in various ways.

15 40. Despite the overwhelming opposition to the Project, and the clear evidence
16 presented demonstrating that the Project was inconsistent with the Downtown Specific Plan, the
17 Planning Commission voted 4-1 to recommend that the City Council approve the Project. As
18  part of this action, the Planning Commission recommended that the City Council adopt a
19 resolution finding the Project is exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines 15182(c). 1
20 The Planning Commission also incorrectly concluded that the Project was in substantial

21 conformance with the Downtown Specific Plan's standards and guidelines.

22 41. Just a few weeks later, on May 24, 2021, the City Council considered Eden

23 Housing's application for Downtown Design Review and Vesting Tentative Parcel Map for the
24 Project, as well as an amendment to the DDLA. In advance of the City Council's hearing
25 regarding the Project, Save Livermore Downtown submitted two letters to the Councilmembers

26

27

28 As used herein, CEQA Guidelines refers to California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Chapter 3, sections 15000-15387.

ATTORNEYS AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
1.0g ANGELES

F detailing the many ways the Project violated relevant local and state laws, including, but not

2 limited to, the State Density Bonus Law, CEQA, and the Planning and Zoning Law.

3 42. The City Council Staff Report for the Project noted that between the Planning
4 Commission's consideration of the Project and the City Council's May 24 meeting, Eden

5 Housing had eliminated its Density Bonus incentive request related to parking, and replaced that

6 with a request to deviate from the Downtown Specific Plan's setback requirements applicable to
7 the Project Site. Despite the Project's numerous additional inconsistencies with the Downtown

8 Specific Plan raised by Save Livermore Downtown and other members of the public, the Staff
9 Report confirmed that the Project's design had not changed since the Planning Commission
10 considered it.

11 43. Ultimately, after hours of testimony by the public, the City Council continued the
12 hearing to the following day for deliberation and a vote. Ignoring the views of the majority of
13 Livermore residents, on May 25, 2021, the City Council voted to approve the Project, including
14 Downtown Design Review 20-019 and Vesting Tentative Parcel Map 11186 - Subdivision 21-
15 003, as well as an amendment to the DDLA. In doing so, the City Council inappropriately
16 determined that the Project was exempt from CEQA under Government Code section 65457 and
17 CEQA Guidelines section 15182(c), as well as pursuant to CEQA Guidelines sections 15332,
18 | 15304(a)-(b), and 15308.

19 44. On June 2, 2021, the City filed with the Alameda County Clerk a Notice of
20 Exemption for the Project, asserting that it was exempt from CEQA.

21 Save Livermore Downtown And The Alternative Plan

22 45. Save Livermore Downtown recognizes that more affordable housing projects
23 need to be built in Livermore to address statewide, regional, and local housing and homelessness
24 challenges, Nevertheless, the Project Site is critically is important to Save Livermore Downtown,

25 and the highest and best use for that site is a regional park that can be accessed by citizens of
26 Livermore and residents of the region.

27 46. Prior to the City Council's unlawful approval of the Project, Save Livermore
28 Downtown worked extensively on an alternative plan for the Project that would allow the Project
10
LATHAM&WATKINSw VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE ATTORNEYS AT LAW
LOS ANGELES

1 Site to be developed with a park and enable additional affordable housing units to be constructed
2 across the street just North of Railroad Avenue. The alternative plan would also potentially
3 allow for up to 100 more affordable housing units than the Project, for a total of 230 units.

4 47. Recent polling has indicated that a large number of Livermore constituents prefer

5 this alternative plan to the Project proposed by Eden Housing.

6 48. Although Save Livermore Downtown has brought this alternative plan to the
7 attention of the City and Eden Housing, neither has genuinely considered the alternative plan.

8 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

9 49. Save Livermore Downtown has exhausted all administrative remedies available to

10 it. and has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, to ensure
11 appropriate City review of the Project. All violations alleged herein were raised by Save

12 Livermore Downtown or others during the administrative process for the Project.
13 50. Save Livermore Downtown has written detailed letters and provided evidence of
14 environmental impacts and of the surrounding community's opposition to the Project-all to no
15 avail. The City failed to engage meaningfully with Petitioner regarding the Project and its
16  potentially significant environmental impacts. (See Exhibits D and E [exhibits to letters
17 omitted].)

18 51. Save Livermore Downtown has timely filed this petition within any and all
19 applicable CEQA statutes of limitation.

20 52. Save Livermore Downtown has complied with Public Resources Code section
21 21167. 7 by serving a copy of this Petition on the California Attorney General. (See Exhibit F.)
22 53. Save Livermore Downtown has also complied with Public Resources Code
23 section 21167.5 by providing the City with notice of intention to commence the action. (See
24 Exhibit G.)

25 54. Save Livermore Downtown elects to prepare the administrative record, as
26 reflected in the Notice of Election to Prepare the Administrative Record filed concurrently with
27 this Petition.

28

1 IRREPARABLE HARM

2 55. Absent injunctive relief, Save Livermore Downtown, the public, and future
3 residents of the Project will suffer irreparable harm from significant environmental impacts that
4 the City has failed to avoid or mitigate through environmental review of the Project.

5 56. Damages are not adequate to compensate Save Livermore Downtown for the
6 City's violations of CEQA and relevant planning and zoning laws, including the significant

7 impacts to health, safety, and the environment that the Project will create.

8 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

9 (Writ of Mandate - Violations of CEQA)

10 57. Save Livermore Downtown incorporates in full all preceding paragraphs by this
11 reference.

12 58. By enacting CEQA, the California Legislature sought to require all public
13 agencies to give careful, deliberate consideration to preventing environmental damage. (CEQA
14 Guidelines, § 15021(a)(1).) Whenever a public agency is required to issue discretionary
15 approval for a proposed project, the CEQA process is triggered to ensure that prior to agency
16 approval, the project's significant environmental impacts are disclosed to the public, and are
17 avoided or mitigated where feasible. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21080.)

18 59. If there is substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that a proposed project
19 may have a significant effect on the environment, the public agency with authority to grant
20 discretionary approval for the project must initiate a public, comprehensive environmental
21 review process under CEQA and prepare an EIR. (See CEQA Guidelines, § 15021(a)(1).)
22 60. The City's approval of the Project is a discretionary government action to which
23 CEQA applies.

24 61. When the City approved the Project, it improperly concluded the Project was
25 exempt from CEQA review pursuant to a statutory exemption and three categorical exemptions.
26 62. First, the City improperly determined that the Project is exempt from CEQA
27 review under Government Code section 65457 and CEQA Guidelines section 15182(c). A
28 residential project implementing a Specific Plan only qualifies for this exemption if (1) an
12
LATHAM&WATKINS4
ATTORNEYG AT LAW VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
LOS ANOELES

agency has prepared an EIR on a Specific Plan after January 1, 1980, (2) the residential project

2 conforms to the Specific Plan, and (3) no events under Public Resources Code section 21166

3 have occurred since the adoption of the Specific Plan. (Gov't Code, § 65457(a).)

4 63. As described herein, the Project is inconsistent with the Downtown Specific Plan.

5 64. Because the Project does not comply with the required standards in the Specific

6 Plan, the CEQA exemption cannot be used. (Gov't Code, § 65457(a) [project must be
7  "consistent with a specific plan a for which an environmental impact report has been certified"]
8 [emphasis added]; see also CEQA Guidelines, 15182(c)(1) ["[A] residential project undertaken

9 pursuant to and in conformity to that specific plan is exempt from CEQA if the project meets the
10 requirements of this section."] [emphasis added].)

11 65. Additionally, recent activity and concerns raised by the Regional Board require
12 the City to engage in supplemental or subsequent environmental review before approving the
13 Project under Public Resources Code section 21166. Under this section, an agency must engage
14 in subsequent or supplemental environmental review after certification of an initial EIR when:

15 (1) substantial project changes that will require major revisions to the previous EIR; (2)
16 substantial changes regarding project circumstances that will require major revisions to the
17 previous EIR; or (3) new information of substantial importance that was not known or could not

18 have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the previous EIR was

19 certified. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15162(a); Pub. Resources Code, § 21166.) If any of these
20 conditions occur, a subsequent or supplemental EIR must be prepared by "the public agency

21 which grants the next discretionary approval for the project, if any." (CEQA Guidelines, §
22 15162(c); Pub. Resources Code, § 21166.)

23 66. Although the City determined the Project would comply with the 2009 EIR
24 mitigation measures, these mitigation measures do not address recent concerns of the Regional
25 Board. It is clear that the Regional Board has newfound concerns regarding contamination of the
26 site; the Regional Board recognizes the site has several chemicals of concern in the soil and
27 groundwater, including arsenic, lead, petroleum hydrocarbons, and volatile organic compounds,
28 chemicals subsequently discovered by soil testing and not taken into consideration by the City in
13

•14

its 2009 determination that implementation of the Specific Plan would result in less-than-
2 significant impacts. Here, development of the Project will exacerbate the current contamination

3 issues and result in a significant impact on the environment and public health. Moreover, an
4 agency's approval of a remedial action plan is subject to CEQA. Thus, the Project is not exempt
5 from further environmental review under Government Code section 65457.

6 67. The Project is also not categorically exempt under CEQA Guidelines sections

7 15332 (infill projects), 15304 (a) and (b) (minor alterations to land), or 15308 (actions taken by

8 regulatory agencies to ensure the maintenance, restoration, enhancement, or protection of the
9 environment).

10 68. First, the CEQA Guidelines section 15332 exemption for in-fill development
11 projects requires a project to be "consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all
12 applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations."
13 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15332(a).) The Project does not conform to the applicable development
14 standards in the Downtown Specific Plan, which serve as the zoning regulations for the property.
15 69. Second, the Project is not exempt under CEQA Guidelines section 15304 as a
16 minor alteration to land. That the Project involves landscaping and minor grading does not
17 qualify the Project in its entirety to be exempt as a minor alteration. There will also be
18 significant construction and development of 130-housing units.

19 70. Third, the Project is not exempt under CEQA Guidelines section 15308 as an
20 action taken by a regulatory agency for the protection of the environment. Although Parcel Two
21 is intended to be dedicated to the City for use as a park, "[c]onstruction activities and relaxation
22 of standards allowing environmental degradation are not included in this exemption." (CEQA
23 Guidelines, § 15308.) Here, construction of the Project would exacerbate the current
24  contamination issues and result in significant impact on the environment and public health.
25 The Project therefore does not qualify for this exemption.

26 71. Even if the Project did fall under any of these categorical exemptions, the

27 presence of unusual circumstances prevents the use of any of the three categorical exemptions
28 relied upon by the City. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15300.2(c).)

J 72. The "unusual circumstances" exception to a categorical exemption involves two
2 inquiries: (1) whether the project presents unusual circumstances; and (2) whether there is a
3 reasonable possibility that a significant environmental impact will result due to those
4 circumstances. (Committee to Save the Hollywoodland Specific Plan V. City of Los Angeles

5

6 (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1186 [citation and footnote omitted].) Further, if the agency finds
a project will have a significant impact, that finding necessarily establishes that some
7 circumstance of the project is unusual, and the exception applies. (Berkeley Hillside
8 Preservation v City of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1086, 1105.)

9 73. The presence of contamination on the Project Site, particularly the presence of
10 soil vapor intrusion as noted by the Regional Board, will have a significant impact on the
11 environment, and therefore constitutes an unusual circumstance.

12 74. At the very least, the Regional Board's concerns constitute evidence
13 demonstrating a reasonable possibility that a significant impact will result from this Project.
14 | That the risk of soil vapor intrusion releasing into the residential structure constitutes an
15 | "unusual" circumstance for housing project is without question. Most in-fill development
16 projects within city limits or projects constituting minor alterations to land do not include the risk
17 of soil vapor intrusion harming the residents of the project. In addition, projects falling under the
18 exemption for regulatory actions protecting the environment would not include the potential
19 significant impact of hazardous chemicals seeping into groundwater and soil. Thus, the presence

20

21 of unusual circumstances defeats any categorical exemption relied upon by the City.
75. Because the City has failed to conduct the appropriate environmental review of
22 the Project, the City has abdicated its responsibilities under CEQA, and a writ of mandate is
23 necessary to compel the City to fulfill its duties under State law.

77. Approvals for development projects must be consistent with applicable land use
2 legislative rules, such as general plans, specific plans, and zoning ordinances. (See Land Waste

3 Mgmt. v. Contra Costa County Bd. Of Supervisors (1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 950, 957-958; Collier

4 V. City and County of San Francisco (2007) 151 Cal.App.4th 1326, 1333; see also Gov't Code,

5 §§ 65456(a), 65860(a)(2).)

6 78. Here, the Project is inconsistent with the Downtown Specific Plan in various
7 respects, including, but not limited to, the Specific Plan's development standards and design
8 objectives and standards relating to siting and orientation, windows, overall building massing,

9 horizontal massing, site frontage, open space (both private and public), and other standards.
10 79. The City has not required Eden Housing to address these inconsistencies, nor has
11 it granted Eden Housing concessions or incentives to evade certain standards in the Specific Plan
12 under the Density Bonus Law, other than one concession related to maximum setbacks.

13 80. The California Density Bonus law (Government Code sections 65915-65918), as
14 implemented through Livermore Development Code section 6.02.030, provides for increased
15 project densities and developer incentives for development projects that provide a certain
16 percentage of affordable units. An applicant that qualifies for a density bonus may also request
17 development concessions or incentives, even if a density bonus is not requested. However, a
18 developer is not entitled to an unlimited number of incentives; rather, the number of incentives
19 received is tied to the percentage of affordable units provided. The Project is entitled to receive
20  maximum of four incentives or concessions. (See Gov't Code, § 65915(d)(2).)

21 81. Because the City cannot grant the Project more than four incentives under the
22 Density Bonus Law, even if Eden Housing had maximized its incentive requests for the Project,
23 which it did not, the Project will continue to remain inconsistent with the Specific Plan.
24 82. Furthermore, the Housing Accountability Act does not prevent the City from
25 denying approval of the Project. Nothing in the Housing Accountability Act abrogated the legal

26 mandate that the City ensure the Project is consistent with relevant legislative land use rules in
27 the City, including the Downtown Specific Plan, the General Plan, and the Livermore
28 Development Code.

Subject: Approval of Site Assessment and Summary Report and Site History Technical Report and Request for Data Gap Workplan and Interim Remedial Action Plan - Old Train Depot, 20, 22 & 24 S. L Street & 2009 to 2073 Railroad Ave, Livermore, Alameda County
Dear Mr. Lanphier:
This letter approves the April 18, 2020, Site Assessment and Summary Report (Site Assessment) and May 22, 2020. Site History Technical Report (Report) submitted by the City of Livermore (City) in response to the Regional Water Board's April 24,2020, directive letter. As explained below, we request the City submit a Data Gap Assessment Workplan and an Interim Remedial Action Plan for the Old Train Depot (Site).
Background
The Site is located within the Livermore Downtown Core Development project area and historically was used as a lumber yard and a train depot with multiple railroad lines. Prospective development of the Site consists of multiple residential and commercial buildings and a Veteran's park.
Soil, groundwater, and soil vapor sampling were conducted at the Site to assess the presence of chemicals from operations at and nearby the Site. Nearby properties historically included a dry cleaner, auto body operations, and other commercial and industrial uses. Results of investigations conducted since 2009 identified select metals in soil, petroleum hydrocarbons in soil and groundwater, and volatile organic compounds, including tetrachloroethene (PCE) and its breakdown products, in groundwater and soil vapor. The Deep Zone groundwater (approximately 100 to 390 feet below ground surface [bgs]) is used by the California Water Service for drinking water. The closest water supply well is located approximately ½ mile downgradient of the Site and is reportedly screened from 22 to 192 feet bgs. The Report concludes the following:

Soil containing metals at concentrations greater than environmental screening levels will require management during site grading and use.

Exhibit B
22

Additional action, focused on soil vapor and groundwater, is warranted to assess, remediate, and/or mitigate PCE and its breakdown products at the Site.

Comments

. Water Board staff concur with the Report's conclusions that soil management will be necessary during Site development and that additional assessment is needed to further characterize the extent of PCE and its breakdown products in soil vapor and groundwater.
Water Board staff request additional evaluation be conducted to assess whether operations as a lumber yard could have impacted the Site. Chemicals historically used to treat lumber (e.g., pentachlorophenol, dioxin) could potentially have been released if treated lumber was stored at the Site or if lumber was treated onsite.
Prior to construction and Site redevelopment, a Site Management Plan that has been reviewed and approved by the Water Board will be necessary to address handling, management, and disposal of contaminated media during construction activities.

Request for Data Gap Assessment Workplan and Interim Remedial Action Plan The Water Board requests the City submit the following two reports:
1. Data Gap Assessment Workplan (Workplan) 2. Interim Remedial Action Plan (IRAP).
No deadline is set for submittal of these documents; however, we request the City work with the Water Board case manager to submit the reports in a reasonable timeframe.
The Workplan should propose soil, groundwater, and/or soil vapor sampling to collect data that will fill identified data gaps and develop a robust conceptual site model (CSM) considering the proposed future use of the Site. The Workplan should include the rationale for the proposed investigative activities, sampling locations, sampling methods, and analytical testing methods.
The IRAP should present the results of the investigation conducted under the Workplan, including, but not limited to maps showing sampling locations and chemical concentration data, tabulated data, lithologic logs, and analytical laboratory reports. In addition, the IRAP should include the updated CSM and describe the remedial alternatives evaluated, remedial alternative selected, and proposed implementation method and timeframe.

The City is required to submit all documents in electronic format to the State Water Resources Control Board's GeoTracker database, pursuant to the California Code of Regulations (Title 23, Section 3890, et seq.). See Electronic Submittal of Information for guidance on submitting documents to GeoTracker. Please note that this requirement includes all analytical data, monitoring well information (latitudes, longitudes, elevations, and water depth), site maps, and boring logs.

Exhibit B
23

Basis for Request
The information required in these reports is needed to further understand the extent of site contamination and identify remedial options that can reduce or eliminate future impacts to human health or water quality from site contamination. The City is named in
its capacity as the current landowner.

1.0 INTRODUCTION

PANGEA Environmental Services, Inc. (PANGEA) prepared this Data Gap Assessment Workplan (Workplan) for the subject site at 20, 22 and 24 S. L Street and 2009 to 2073 Railroad Avenue (Site). This
Workplan was requested by the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board letter dated
February 9, 2021 (Appendix A). The Site is in the northwest corner of Livermore Village and was
historically used as a train depot and lumber yard (Figure 3B). Planned redevelopment of the Site includes construction of multifamily residences and Veteran's Park, scheduled to commence in early to mid 2022.
The objective of the proposed assessment is to further characterize site conditions and help facilitate interim
remedial action in advance of the planned site development. An interim remedial action plan will be
provided in a separate report. The site background, site conceptual model and data gaps, and proposed data
gap investigation activities are described below.

2.0 SITE BACKGROUND

This section describes the planned development, site history, prior environmental investigation, and
constituents of concern from historical assessment data.

2.1 Prospective Development

Prospective development of the Site consists of construction of two multi-family residential building with
approximately 130 units over underground or podium parking and a communal park (Veteran's Park).
The multifamily residences and Veteran's Park are a subset a of the larger Downtown Core Development
project (Figure 2). The Livermore Downtown Core Development project will involve several work phases
by numerous contractors. The project area was initially developed with multiple single-story commercial
retail buildings and paved and unpaved parking lots. The first development project consisted of a six-phase temporary parking plan. The future development project consists of construction of the following: (1) multi-family residential buildings with 130 units over a multi-level and underground parking structure; (2)
a multi-level parking structure with underground parking; (3) several one-story commercial retail and two-
story arts and science buildings; (4) four-story hotel; (5) communal landscaped areas surrounding the
proposed buildings, and (6) surface parking areas.

The footprint of the old train depot is located within Veteran's Park and overlaps with some planned
multifamily residences. The City's grading plan for the project will include the import of top soil for the
upper 2 ft of all lawn/landscaping areas. The location of former Site buildings and proposed buildings are
shown on Figure 3,

May 7, 2021

2.2 Site History

According to project documents (Fugro, 2007a; Fugro, 2007b; SCI, 1998), historical site use for the Site
included:

Multiple railroad lines that ran parallel and approximately 100 to 350 ft south of Railroad Avenue;

Former railroad depot building (Southern Pacific Railroad) at 22 L South L Street; and

Former lumber storage yard located at the corner of Railroad Avenue and L Street.

According to project documents (Fugro, 2007a; Fugro 2007b; SCI, 1998), historical site use for nearby
properties within the Livermore Downtown Core Development project area has included, but was not
limited to, the following:

Former dry cleaner operations (J Cleaners) at 2093 Railroad Avenue and former dry cleaner
operations (Quality Cleaners) at 2048 First Street;

Auto body operations at 2121 and 2139 Railroad Avenue; and

Various other commercial and industrial site uses, as well as paved parking lots.
2.3 Summary of Prior Environmental Investigation
May 2005, Fugro: Data from the 2005 assessment by Fugro indicated the presence of petroleum
hydrocarbons in soil and groundwater, and VOCs in groundwater at the Site. The detected
petroleum hydrocarbons at the Site were primarily TPHg, TPHd, and TPHmo. The VOC primarily
detected in groundwater beneath the Site was PCE (a common degreasing chemical), with a much
smaller fraction of breakdown product TCE. Select concentrations detected in Site soil and
groundwater exceed current 2019 Tier 1 environmental screening levels (ESLs) established by the
San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board. Assessment procedures, results and
conclusions of the 2005 investigation are documented in Fugro's Phase 2 Summary Report dated
May 13, 2005.

April-May 2018, BSK: In April and May 2018, BSK Associates performed shallow soil sampling
for analysis of petroleum hydrocarbons and metals. Arsenic, lead, and nickel were detected at
concentrations above 2019 Tier I ESLs. Most metal concentrations above Tier 1 ESL screening
levels may represent background soil conditions (Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory [LBNL],
2009). Arsenic concentrations in select samples above background conditions within the upper 2 ft of soil were located on the Site, possibly associated with the former lumber and/or railroad depot
operations. Arsenic was reportedly used historically a as a rodenticide in this area. Historical

Livermore, California
May 7, 2021

property redevelopment reportedly involved the import of shallow material, an explanation for
higher arsenic concentrations detected at 10 to 16 inches bgs than at 0 to 6 inches bgs.

June-November 2018, Pangea: The 2018 investigation by Pangea included soil gas sampling from
shallow and deep soil gas wells, soil sampling during select soil gas well installation, sampling of
shallow zone groundwater via monitoring well MW-4, and discrete-depth grab groundwater
sampling of perched and shallow zone groundwater. PCE was detected in shallow and deep soil
gas, and in perched and shallow zone groundwater at concentrations above 2019 Tier ESLs.
Arsenic and nickel were detected in shallow soil at concentrations above 2019 Tier 1 ESLs. In the
Site Assessment Summary Report dated April 18, 2018, Pangea concluded that additional
investigation is merited to further characterize PCE in the subsurface, and to evaluate the need for
Site remediation. Pangea also concluded that shallow metal-bearing soil (arsenic, lead and nickel) with concentrations above Tier 1 ESLs merits management during future soil grading and Site use,
and profiling for any soil export during construction.

2.4 Constituents of Concern from Historical Data

Constituents of concern from historical assessment include the following:

Metals arsenic, lead, and nickel in shallow soil,

Petroleum hydrocarbons in soil and groundwater, including naphthalene, total petroleum
hydrocarbons as gasoline (TPHg), diesel (TPHd), and motor oil-range (TPHmo), and

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in groundwater including tetrachloroethene (PCE) and
breakdown product trichloroethene (TCE).

However, note that vinyl chloride has been detected immediately upgradient of the Site in shallow-zone
groundwater wells MW-2 and MW-3 located near the adjacent former Quality Cleaners. Vinyl chloride is
a breakdown product of PCE, the dry-cleaning chemical used af the former Quality Cleaners. PCE may
have been used at the subject Site as a degreaser.

2.5 Site Geology and Hydrogeology

Based on soil logging data from Site documents and available information from nearby sites, soil at and
near the Site generally consists of interbedded coarse- and fine-grained materials including silt, clay, silty
sand, silty/sandy/clayey gravel. The Site is located in the Mocho Subbasin in the south-central portion of
the Livermore Valley. Available documents for the Site and nearby Sites and the well MW-4 soil logging,
the subsurface at the Site and nearby is currently generally characterized as shown below on Table A.

Within the Downtown Core Project area, the historical perched groundwater zone was approximately 31 to
46 ft bgs with the confined shallow groundwater zone approximately 52 to 70 ft bgs within the Downtown
Core Project area. For the subject Site, the perched and shallow groundwater zones include thin lenses of
fine-grained material within these zones. The site geology and hydrogeology is summarized on cross section
Figure 10. The is cross section location is shown on Figure 8. Groundwater beneath the Site and vicinity
reportedly flows in the approximate northwest direction.

2.6 Water Supply Wells and Nearby VOC Plumes
The Deep Zone is present approximately 100 to 390 ft bgs and is used by the City of Livermore for drinking
water purposes. The closest water supply well (CalWater 8P1) is located approximately ½ mile
hydraulically downgradient of the Site and apparently screened from 122 to 192 ft bgs. According to a
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory report, "PCE is nearly ubiquitous in Livermore wells...the
Mocho Subbasin has a relative high degree of vulnerability to contamination from surface sources." Select
nearby water supply wells have wellhead treatment for contamination.

From review of the State Board Geotracker database, there are several sites in the Site vicinity with subsurface PCE impact to groundwater. Groundwater beneath the Site and vicinity reportedly flows in the
approximate northwest direction. Sites with known PCE groundwater plumes are located upgradient and
cross-gradient of the Site and include Desert Petroleum/Valley Gas at 2008 First Street, Groth Brothers
Chevrolet L at 57-59 South L Street, and Mike's and Paul's Cleaners at the Livermore Arcade Shopping
Center site.

From historical and 2018 assessment by the City, VOC and TPH groundwater impact has also been
identified at adjacent properties 2048 First Street (former Quality Cleaners) and 2093 Railroad Avenue
(former J Cleaners).

3.0 CONCEPTUAL SITE MODEL AND DATA GAPS

This section describes the Site geology/hydrogeology and chemical conditions in Site soil, soil gas, and
groundwater based on field observations, information from nearby sites, and current/historical site
assessment data. The distribution of chemicals of concern is summarized on Figures 4 through 9. The cross
section on Figure 10 illustrates subsurface conditions with respect to Site soil type and hydrogeologic
conditions.

3.1 Soil Conditions

Soil conditions are summarized as follows:

• The following compounds have been detected in shallow soil above 1 2019 Tier 1 ESLS: select
metals (arsenic, lead, and nickel) and TPHd, and TPHmo. (No PCE or chlorinated VOCs have been
detected in analyzed soil samples for the Site). Table 2 presents soil analytical data with respect to
various environmental screening levels.

Figure 4 shows the estimated extent of key metal impact in soil.

The arsenic- and lead-bearing soil merits management during future soil grading and Site use, and
profiling for any soil export during construction.

Arsenic, lead, and nickel were detected at concentrations above conservative Tier 1 ESLs. The maximum
concentrations of these metals were 55 milligrams/kilogram (mg/kg) arsenic, 200 mg/kg lead, and 370
mg/kg nickel. Most metal concentrations above 2019 Tier 1 ESL screening levels may represent
background soil conditions (LBNL, 2009). Arsenic concentrations in select samples above background
conditions within the upper 2 ft of soil were located on the Site, possibly associated with the former lumber
and/or railroad depot operations. Arsenic was reportedly used historically as a rodenticide in this area.
Figure 4 shows the extent of arsenic in shallow soil above 11 milligrams/kilogram. Historical property
redevelopment reportedly involved the import of shallow material, an explanation for higher arsenic
concentrations detected at 10 to 16 inches bgs than at 0 to 6 inches bgs. Sampling locations where nickel
concentrations exceeded background conditions and the construction worker ESL of 86 mg/kg are noted
on Figure 4.

Select samples with metal impact were also analyzed using Toxic Characteristic Leaching Procedure
(TCLP) and Waste Extraction Test (WET) test methods to help determine whether any future excavated
soil would be classified as a California hazardous waste. As shown on Figure 4 and Table 2, soil samples
at B-2 and B-4 from 10 to 16 inches bgs contained STLC lead concentrations (WET testing) above the
Non-RCRA Class I (California) hazardous waste criteria of 5 mg/L. Lead TCLP data did not exceed 5
mg/L, the RCRA Class I (Federal) hazardous waste criteria.

Because Pangea performed sampling at the Site in conjunction with sampling at other locations within the
Downtown Core Development Project area, laboratory analytical reports include data from other sites not
related to the Multifamily Residence Redevelopment.

3.2 Soil Gas Conditions

Soil gas conditions are summarized as follows:

The following compounds have been detected in soil gas above 2019 residential vapor intrusion
ESLs: PCE and benzene. TCE, trans-1,2-DCE, and ethylbenzene concentrations were below Tier
l ESLs. Table 4 presents soil gas analytical data with respect to various environmental screening
levels.

A PCE source could be near the historic railroads based on the highest PCE in shallow soil gas,
while PCE concentrations are highest in deeper soil gas near historic perched groundwater. PCE
in deeper soil gas could be affected by historical migration of PCE from the upgradient former
Quality Cleaners (Figure 6).

Figure 5 shows the estimated PCE extent in shallow soil gas (0-10 ft bgs).

. Figure 6 shows the estimated PCE extent in deeper soil gas (15-30 ft bgs).
Figure 10 shows the estimated PCE extent in cross section.
For shallow soil gas (5 ft bgs), PCE was detected in all shallow soil gas monitoring wells at concentrations
above l the 2019 Tier 1 ESL of 15 pg/m°. The PCE concentrations in shallow soil gas ranged from 34.6 to
387 Hg/m', with the highest PCE at SGMF-4-5 near a historic railroad line.
For deeper soil gas (15-25 ft bgs), PCE was detected in all deeper soil gas monitoring wells at
concentrations above the 2019 Tier 1 ESL of 15 uug/m'. The PCE concentrations in deeper soil gas ranged
from 111 to 5,340 ug/m', with the highest PCE at SGMF-3-25 near the former passenger depot and
downgradient of the nearby Quality Cleaners at 2048 First Street. The PCE in deeper soil is present in the
approximate zone of former perched groundwater that had PCE impact.
Near the former Site operations, benzene was detected primarily in the deeper soil gas wells. Benzene
exceeded its Tier 1 ESL of 3.2 ug/m' at the following concentrations in deeper soil gas sampling locations
at 25 ft bgs: 58 ug/m' (SGMF-2-25), 14.1 .g/m3(SGMF-4-25), and 5 ug/m' (SGMF-3-25), while at 15 ft
bgs only 3.55 pg/m' at SGMF-4-15 slightly exceeded the Tier 1 ESL. However, for the clustered shallow
and deeper soil gas wells at SGQC-6 (located closer to the Valley Gas and Quality Cleaner sites), maximum

benzene concentrations were higher at 27.1 ug/m' (SGQC-6-5), 115 ug/m'(SGQC-6-15), and 86.5 ug/m'
(SGQC-6-30). This data suggests that benzene concentrations are highest in deeper soil gas.
PCE-breakdown products cis-1,2-dichloroethene and vinyl chloride were not detected in Site soil gas. Other
VOCs were detected in soil gas at concentrations below 2019 Tier ESLs, if ESLs established.

3.3 Groundwater Conditions

Groundwater conditions are summarized as follows:

The following compounds have been detected in groundwater above Tier ESLs: PCE, chloroform,
TPHg and TPHd. The primary chemical of concern is PCE. Table 3 presents groundwater analytical
data with respect to environmental screening levels.

Perched and shallow groundwater data suggest PCE impact is highest near well MW-4 and HP-1-
MF near the center of the Site, with additional PCE and VOC impact present at the upgradient edge
of the Site near wells MW-2 and MW-3 monitoring the apparent PCE release from former Quality
Cleaners.

Figure 7 shows the estimated PCE extent in perched groundwater (31-44 ft bgs).
Figure 8 shows the estimated PCE extent in shallow zone groundwater (60-72 ft bgs).
Figure 10 shows the estimated PCE extent in perched and shallow groundwater in cross section.
PCE above Tier 1 ESL: PCE and its breakdown products have been detected in grab groundwater samples
collected from borings and in samples ollected from Site monitoring well MW-4. PCE was detected in monitoring well MW-4 at a concentration of 10.2 ug/L during the July 26, 2018 sampling. From 2018 grab
sampling in shallow zone groundwater (66 to 70 ft bgs), PCE concentrations ranged from 4.6 ug/L to 16 ug/L. For perched zone groundwater in 2018, PCE was detected at a concentration of 4.9 ug/L at 41 to 45
ft bgs. From prior grab sampling of shallow perched groundwater at boring location B-1 in 2005, PCE was
detected at 19 ug/L at 31 to 35 ft bgs, and 18 ug/L at 40 to 44 ft bgs. These concentrations exceed the 2019 Tier ESL of 0.64 ug/L

TPHg, TPHd and Chloroform above Tier 1 ESLs: TPHg and TPHd was detected at maximum concentrations
of 170 ug/L and 330 ug/L, respectively, above the Tier 1 ESL of 100 Hg/L during perched groundwater
sampling in 2005. Chloroform detected in the July 11, 2018 grab sample from the boring for well MW-4
contained a concentration of 1.3 ug/L, above the Tier I ESL of 0.81 ug/L.
Chemicals Below Tier 1 ESLs: Other VOCs detected in shallow zone groundwater from monitoring well
MW-4 below Tier 1 ESLs included TCE (0.138 ug/L), chloroform (0.708 ug/L), and naphthalene (0.117

Hg/L). Bromodichloromethane detected in the July 11, 2018 grab sample from the boring for well MW-4
contained a concentration of 0.57 ug/L, below the Tier I ESL of 0.87 ug/L.
However, note that vinyl chloride has been detected immediately upgradient of the Site in shallow-zone
groundwater wells MW-2 and MW-3 located 40 ft south of the Site near the adjacent former Quality
Cleaners. Vinyl chloride is a breakdown product of PCE, the dry cleaning chemical used at the former
Quality Cleaners. The presence of petroleum hydrocarbons presumably associated with the Valley Gas case
could be contributing to PCE degradation, as commonly occurs when PCE and petroleum plumes comingle.
For 2018 shallow zone grab groundwater sampling, no TCE or naphthalene was detected but chloroform was detected at 0.60 to 0.77 Hg/L (below Tier I ESL of 0.81 ug/L). From prior grab sampling of shallow perched groundwater at boring location B-1 in 2005, TCE was detected at a maximum of 1.0 ug/L and
chloroform was detected at 0.54 ug/L.

3.4 CSM and Data Gap Conclusions

Based on the above information, Pangea offers the following conclusions for the site CSM and data gaps:

The primary chemicals of concern at the Site are PCE and select metals. PCE has been detected
in soil gas and groundwater at concentrations above 2019 Tier screening levels. This PCE impact
merits further characterization and possible mitigation and/or remediation with respect to
prospective development at the Site. Shallow metal-bearing soil (arsenic, lead and nickel) with
concentrations above Tier 1 ESLs merits management during future soil grading and Site use, and
profiling for any soil export during construction.

Soil Data Gaps Merit Investigation: Shallow soil impact from historic uses has not been fully
characterized. Arsenic and lead impact detected in shallow soil from prior investigations merits
further characterization. Due to former site use as a lumberyard, soil assessment is merited for
chemicals historically used to treat lumber (e.g., arsenic, chromium, copper, pentachlorophenol,
creosote and dioxins).

PCE in Soil Gas Merits Investigation: A PCE source could be present near the historic railroad lines
based on the highest PCE impact in shallow soil gas. Higher PCE concentrations in deeper (15 to
30 ft bgs) soil gas are present near the depth of historical perched groundwater; this PCE in deeper soil gas could be affected by historical PCE migration from the upgradient former Quality Cleaners
site (Figure 6).

PCE in Soil Gas Represents a Potential Vapor Intrusion Concern for Future Development: Action
is merited to assess, remediate, and/or mitigate PCE at the Site. Site assessment could help determine if any discrete PCE soil impact exists that merits excavation or vapor extraction to

Exhibit C

remove the source of PCE volatilization into shallow soil gas. Deeper soil gas impact could also be
remediated or mitigated by soil vapor extraction, if merited. For any residual PCE in soil gas above
applicable screening levels or human health risk criteria at the time of future occupied Site
structures, engineering controls can safeguard future occupants and receptors from potential vapor intrusion. The planned subgrade ventilated parking structure beneath the future buildings is an engineering control that would safeguard against vapor intrusion.

Data Gaps in Groundwater Merit Assessment. The PCE impact in Site groundwater monitoring
well MW-4 and prior grab groundwater sampling locations slightly exceeded Tier 1 ESLs.
Additional grab groundwater sampling, well monitoring, and/or additional groundwater monitoring
well installation is merited to further characterize and monitor the plume stability of PCE and its
degradation products near existing well MW-4, and to evaluate the potential for VOC migration
onto the Site from offsite sources. The limited PCE impact in shallow zone groundwater apparently
does not represent a significant threat to the nearest water supply well (CalWater 8P1), located
approximately ½ mile downgradient of the Site and screened from 122 to 192 ft bgs.

4.0 PROPOSED DATA GAP INVESTIGATION ACTIVITIES
The following proposed site assessment activities are designed to address the data gaps presented above. The proposed site assessment sampling locations are presented on Figures 4 through 10. The general
objectives of the proposed site assessment are to:

Soil: Assess shallow soil near the former lumberyard to evaluate possible impact from compounds
(e.g., pentachlorophenol, creosote, and dioxins) not analyzed during prior assessment. And
assessment of soil to 15 ft depth within the planned site grading/soil export area for planned
underground parking to assist with soil profiling for disposal.

Soil Gas: Further characterize the extent of VOCs in soil gas to evaluate potential vapor intrusion
for future site use, and to assist with evaluating soil vapor extraction (SVE) described in a separate
report; and

Groundwater: Further characterize the extent of VOCs in perched and shallow groundwater (and
assist with evaluating vapor extraction in historic perched zone).
The sampling and analysis plan for soil, groundwater and soil gas is summarized below on Table B and
detailed on Table 1. The site assessment will be conducted in accordance with agency guidance described
below and PANGEA's standard operating procedures included in Appendix B.

4.1 Pre-Field Activities

Prior to initiating field activities, the following tasks will be conducted:
Obtain drilling permit from the Zone 7 Water Agency;
Pre-mark the excavation area with white paint and notify Underground Service Alert (USA) of
the excavation activities at least 48 hours before work begins;
Prepare a Site-specific health and safety plan (HASP) to educate personnel and minimize their
exposure to potential hazards related to Site activities; and
Coordinate with drilling and laboratory contractors, and with involved parties.

4.2 Soil Assessment

PANGEA proposes to advance soil borings at locations shown on Figure 4. The proposed soil assessment
program includes the following:

Shallow sampling (up to ft depth) within a grid in the former lumberyard area, including analysis
for the following compounds associated with treated wood waste: arsenic, chromium, copper,
pentachlorophenol, creosote and dioxins (DTSC, 2020).

Shallow sampling (up to 3 ft depth) within grid in the planned Veteran's Park and landscaping
areas to assess metal impact in shallow soil.

Deeper soil sampling (up to 15 ft depth) to profile soil for disposal within the planned site
grading/soil export area for underground parking.
For efficiency and to facilitate composite sampling for waste profiling, the site has been divided into a grid of nine cells (1 through 9), as shown on Figure 4. Each cell contains two soil borings, which follow the nomenclature of the cell 1 (e.g., Cell 1 contains borings P1 and P1b, Cell 2 contains borings P2 and P2b, etc.). The cells and borings are arranged with respect to historical land uses and proposed development:

Cells 1, 2 and (P1 through P3b): Within the former lumberyard area (Cells 1 and 2) and the
planned northern Multifamily Residences building footprint with 15-ft depth subgrade garage
(Cells 1, 2 and 3).

Cells 4 and 5 (P4 through P5b): Within the southern Multifamily Residences building footprint
with 15-ft depth subgrade garage.

Cells 6 through 9 (P6a through P9b): Within planned Veteran's Park and grading to 2-ft depth.

May 7, 2021
Deeper borings (P1 through PS) will be cleared to 5 feet below ground surface (ft bgs) using a hand-auger
and advanced to 12 ft depth using direct-push drilling techniques. These deeper borings will be used for
deeper waste profiling in the proposed subgrade garage area. Other borings will be completed to 3 ft bgs to
assist soil characterization and soil disposal profiling.
Soil assessment will be conducted in accordance with PANGEA's standard operating procedures included in Appendix B. Soil will be screened for VOCs using photo ionization detector (PID) and logged by
Pangea under the supervision of a professional geologist or engineer. Soil will be logged continuously per
United Soil Classification System guidelines. Soil samples will be collected in laboratory-supplied contains
and stored at or below 4° Celsius before transport to a State-certified laboratory. Samples will be collected
and analyzed according to the sampling and analysis plan summarized above on Table B.

Following groundwater sampling, the borings will be filled to grade with cement grout with the oversight
7 of a Zone 7 Water Agency inspector.

4.2.1 Soil Sampling and Analysis Plan

The soil sampling and analysis plan is summarized above on Table B.

Shallow Soil Assessment and Profiling for Disposal (all borings and cells): Shallow discrete soil
samples will be collected at 1, 2, and 3 ft bgs from all borings for soil assessment shown on Figure
4. Sufficient soil volume will be collected to facilitate subsequent discrete analysis and leachate
testing, if merited. Four-point composite sample analysis will be performed by depth for each of
the following cell pairs: cell and 2 (P1, Pla, P2, P2a), cells 4 and (P4, P4a, P5, P5a), and cells
6 and 7 8 (P6a, P6b, P7a, P7b), and cells 8 and 9 (P8a, P8b, P9a, P9b). Cell 3 will 9 3 be 2-point
composite. This yields a total of 15 composite analyses. The 15 composite samples for each depth
will be analyzed for the following:
O TPH full scan by EPA Method 8015,

O VOCs by EPA Method 8260B,
o Title 22 Metals by EPA Method 6010/6020,
o SVOCs/PAHs by EPA Method 8270C,

O PCBs by EPA Method 8082,

O Pesticides by EPA Method 8081A, and
O Asbestos by PLM or OSHA 191.

Lumberyard Assessment and Profiling for Disposal: The following compounds are associated with
treated wood (DTSC, 2020): arsenic, chromium, copper, pentachlorophenol, creosote and dioxins.
Arsenic, chromium, and copper will be evaluated by Title 22 analyses listed above.
Pentachlorophenol and creosote will be evaluated by EPA Method 8270C listed above, but with

specific request for creosote analysis). Dioxin will be evaluated by EPA Method 8280A/8290A on
all 4-point composites for cells 1 and 2 within the footprint of the former lumber yard. If
concentrations of concern are detected in the composite analyses, discrete analyses will be
performed.

Deeper Soil Assessment and Profiling for Disposal (P1 through P6): For the five deeper borings
(P1 through P5) will be advanced to 12 ft bgs to facilitate waste disposal profiling of soil excavated
during construction of the proposed subgrade garage. Discrete samples will be collected and
analyzed from each boring at 4, 8 and 12 ft bgs. The 15 discrete samples will be analyzed for the
following:
o TPH full scan by EPA Method 8015,
o VOCs by EPA Method 8260B,

O Title 22 Metals by EPA Method 6010/6020,
• SVOCs/PAHs by EPA Method 8270C,

O PCBs by EPA Method 8082,
o Pesticides by EPA Method 8081A, and
O Asbestos by PLM or OSHA 191.
Discrete soil analyses will be performed on the composite analysis if concentrations of concern are reported
that merit further characterization. If necessary, additional shallow soil sampling will be performed for
supplemental soil characterization for delineation and/or soil disposal profiling. Leachate wet testing for
soluble threshold limit concentration (STLC) and toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP)
analysis for metals will also be performed as merited for soil profiling. An STLC analysis is performed to
determine if soil is characteristically hazardous by California Title 22 standards. A TCLP analysis is
performed to determine if soil is characteristically hazardous by Federal RCRA standards.

4.3 Groundwater Assessment

To further assess the lateral and vertical extent of PCE in site groundwater. PANGEA proposes assessment
at locations shown on Figures 5, 6 and 7. The proposed assessment includes:

Perched Groundwater: Discrete-depth grab groundwater sampling of perched groundwater at five
initial locations (HP-5-MF through HP-9-MF) at approximate depths of 42 - 46 ft bgs (Figure 7).
Up to four contingent step-out grab sampling locations may be advanced after evaluation of
conditions encountered at HP-5-MF through HP-9-MF. Ifelevated VOC or petroleum hydrocarbon
impact is detected in perched groundwater, contingent groundwater monitoring wells may be
installed at these locations. The perched zone groundwater appears to be only sporadically present
and was not encountered during prior drilling of HP-1-JC through HP-6-JC J at J Cleaner in
November 2018.

Shallow Groundwater: Discrete-depth grab groundwater sampling of shallow groundwater at three
locations (HP-8-MF, HP-10-MF, HP-11-MF) at an approximate depth of 62-72 ft bgs (Figure 8).
Two groundwater monitoring wells (MWMF-5 and MWMF-6) are proposed at an approximate
depth of 62-72 ft bgs to facilitate groundwater flow calculation using existing well MW-4 (Figure
8). Well MWMF-5 is proposed near the downgradient edge of property southwest of existing well
MW-4. Well MWMF-6 is proposed upgradient (southeast) of existing well MW-4, and near
elevated VOCs in deeper soil gas at the site. Contingent step-out grab sampling of shallow water may be performed after evaluation of conditions encountered from the proposed assessment.
4.3.1 Groundwater Assessment Sequencing
The groundwater assessment sequence will be based on field conditions, available drilling/sampling equipment, and driller/geologist recommendations at the time. The tentative sequence includes the
following:

First using dual-tube tooling to assess soil lithology to approximately 45 to ft bgs;

• Grab sampling of perched groundwater, if present, from approximately 40 to 45 ft bgs;

Extending the tooling to 75 ft bgs for soil logging of shallow groundwater-bearing zone:

Installation of perched SVE and/or groundwater monitoring wells from 28 to 36 ft bgs based on the
logging information;

Installation of shallow groundwater monitoring wells from 60 to ft 72 ft bgs based on the logging
information;

Subsequent installation of contingent deeper perched groundwater monitoring wells from 40-46 ft bgs, if merited from assessment data.
Alternatively, to minimize potential cross-contamination between upper and lower sampling intervals, the
first logging and sampling will be conducted down to approximately 72 ft bgs using dual-tube tooling.
Sampling of overlying perched groundwater would be sampled using a separate individual borehole.

4.3.2 Grab Groundwater Sampling

Discrete-depth grab groundwater samples will be collected from perched and/or shallow groundwater at
boring locations HP-5-MF through HP-11-MF shown on Figures 7 and 7 8. The borings will be drilled in
accordance with PANGEA's standard field procedures included in Appendix B1.

Exhlbit C
43

Data Gap Assessment Workplan
Old Train Depot 20, 22 & 24 S. L Street & 2009 - 2073 Railroad Avenue

All boring locations will be cleared to 5 ft bgs using a hand-auger and advanced to depth using direct-push
drilling techniques. Dual-tube equipment will be used to facilitate continuous soil logging and confirm the
depths of the water-bearing zones described above in Section 2.5. During boring advancement,
characteristics such as soil type, color, texture, and moisture will be continuously logged in the field using
the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS) and soil will be screened using a photoionization detector
(PID).

For perched zone sampling, the dual-tube tooling will be advanced to 46 ft bgs (or the observed bottom of
the perched groundwater zone from soil logging) and the outer drill rods retracted to approximately 40 ft
bgs, and new temporary PVC casing will be placed into the outer rods for sample collection. The perched
zone borings may be left open overnight if water does not readily accumulate within the casing or
Hydropunch™M screen. If water has not accumulated by the following day, and if time allows, a new boring
may be advanced using dual-tube equipment to the first encountered groundwater depth, as determined by soil logging. Alternatively, Hydropunch™ sampling equipment will be used to facilitate sample depth from
approximately 42-46 ft bgs.

For shallow groundwater zone sampling, upon reaching the total boring depth of 72 ft bgs, the outer drill
rods will be retracted to 62 ft bgs, and new temporary PVC casing with 10 feet of screen will be placed into
the outer rods for sample collection. Alternatively, Hydropunch™M sampling equipment will be used to
facilitate sampling of the target depth.

Grab groundwater samples will be collected from each boring using a new disposable Teflon™ bailer
inserted into the temporary PVC casing or Hydropunch™ sampler and decanted into laboratory-provided
containers. The groundwater samples will be placed in a cooler with ice and transported under chain-of-
custody protocol a California-certified laboratory for testing. Samples will be analyzed for VOCs by EPA
Method 8260B and TPH full scan by EPA Method 8015. PANGEA's Standard Field Procedures for Soil
Borings are included in Appendix B.
Following groundwater sampling, the borings will be filled to grade with cement grout poured through a
tremie pipe with the oversight of a Zone 7 Water Agency inspector.

4.3.3 Monitoring Well Installation

Two groundwater monitoring wells (MWMF-5 and MWMF-6) will be installed at the locations shown on
Figure 8. The groundwater monitoring wells will be installed and sampled in accordance with PANGEA's
standard field procedures included in Appendix B. Depending on field conditions, the monitoring wells
may be installed before or after completion of grab sampling.

Each groundwater well will be drilled to a total depth of approximately 72 ft bgs. ft Hand augering will be
performed for the first 5 feet to clear each location of potential subsurface utilities. Direct-push equipment

may be used at each location to continuous log soil to confirm site lithology and the depth of the shallow
groundwater zone. Any direct-push logs will be widened to 8-inch diameter using hollow stem auger
drilling equipment. Each groundwater well will be constructed with 2-inch diameter, schedule 40 PVC well
casing with 0.010-inch slotted screen. The well screen will be placed from approximately 62 to 72 ft bgs
within the confirmed shallow groundwater zone. A filter pack annulus consisting of #2/12 sand will be
placed from the bottom of the well up to one foot above the top of the well screen. A two-foot well seal of
bentonite will be set above the filter pack. The remaining annular space will be backfilled with Portland
cement and finished with a flush-mounted well box with the oversight of a Zone 7 Water Agency inspector.
Each well will be developed approximately 72 hours after well seal installation in accordance with
PANGEA's standard field procedures. The monitoring well will be developed by surge block agitation
followed by purging of 10 or more well casing volumes of groundwater. Well development will continue
until a hard-well bottom has been achieved and turbidity of the groundwater has been reduced.

4.3.4 Monitoring Well Sampling

The groundwater in the well will be gauged and sampled following low flow sampling protocol. Groundwater will be collected into 40-mL sealed bottles and put on ice. Samples will be transported to a
California-certified laboratory for analysis of VOCs by EPA Method 8260B.
4.3.5 Well Elevation Survey
The soil borings and groundwater monitoring well will be surveyed horizontally and vertically by a
professional surveyor and elevations tied to a local City surveyor benchmark.

4.3.6 Contingent Perched Zone Grab Groundwater Borings and Monitoring Wells
Contingent step-out sampling is proposed at the locations shown on Figures 7 and 8, if merited by results
from initial borings. If elevated VOC or petroleum hydrocarbon impact is detected in initial grab
groundwater samples, contingent grab groundwater borings and/or monitoring wells may be installed in the
perched zone and shallow zone as described above.

Any contingent groundwater assessment will be conducted in accordance with the procedures described
above in Sections 4.1 through 4.3, and with Pangea's Standard Operating Procedures provided in Appendix
B.

4.4 Soil Gas Assessment

To further assess the lateral and vertical extent of PCE in soil gas, PANGEA proposes assessment at
locations shown on Figures 7, 8 and 10. The proposed assessment includes:

Shallow soil gas assessment (within ! to 10 ft bgs) at locations shown on Figure 5, which includes
6 soil gas wells and one SVE well.

Deeper soil gas assessment (within 15 At to 20 ft bgs) at locations shown on Figure 6, which includes
3 soil gas wells and four SVE wells.

Even deeper soil gas assessment (within 28 to 36 ft bgs) within the historical perched groundwater
zone via five SVE wells shown on Figure 7 (these wells will facilitate groundwater monitoring if
significant perched groundwater is encountered).

The SVE wells will facilitate soil gas assessment and may serve as extraction wells for soil vapor extraction
(SVE) as described in a separate interim remedial action plan.

4.4.1 Soil Gas Well Installation and Sampling

A total of ten soil gas wells are proposed at the eight locations shown on Figures 5 and 6. Shallow soil gas
wells SGMF-5-5 through SGMF-12-5 (5 ft depth) will characterization shallow PCE impact. Deeper wells
SGMF-8-15, SGMF-10-15, and SGMF-12-15 (15 ft depth) will be twinned in separate boreholes adjacent
the 5 ft wells.

The soil gas wells will be installed and sampled following Department of Toxic Substances Control's
(DTSC) July 2015 Advisory - Active Soil Gas Investigation guidance, and in accordance with Pangea's
standard operating procedures in Appendix B. Twinned wells will be installed within individual boreholes,
separated by at least 3 feet. Where underground utilities may be located, borings for soil gas wells will be
hand-augured to minimum of 5 ft bgs. To reach the total soil gas well depth, borings will be advanced using
direct-push drilling methods. Drilling equipment will be decontaminated after each use with distilled water
to prevent cross-contamination between drilling locations.

The permanent soil gas wells will be constructed with a one-inch long stainless-steel implant connected to new ¼-inch diameter Teflon tubing and capped with a Swagelok® type fitting. The implant will be placed in a 1-foot thick sand pack with 6-inches of dry granular bentonite above, followed by cement with 5%
bentonite. The wells will be protected by traffic-rated well vaults. All site investigation activities will be
performed under the supervision of a California Registered Civil Professional Engineer (P.E.).
Shallow soil gas wells will be screened approximately 4.5 to 5.5 ft bgs. Deeper soil gas wells will be
screened approximately 14.5 to 15.5 ft bgs. At least 48 hours will be allowed to pass after installation before

the wells are sampled to allow to subsurface gases to equilibrate. Three casing volumes will be purged from
each soil gas well prior to sampling at rate of 100-200 milliliters per minute (ml/min). Each well will be
connected to a certified 1-Liter summa canister with a flow control manifold and placed in a sampling
shroud. A quantitate leak check compound such as isopropanol will be introduced into the shroud at the
time sampling begins. Isopropanol concentrations will be monitored by a photo ionization detector (PID) and maintained at a concentration of 10-20 parts per million (ppm). For additional quality-control, a replicate sample will be collected at one well sampling location. A schematic of the soil gas sampling and
shroud apparatus is presented in Appendix B.

Soil gas samples will be transported to a California-certified laboratory under chain-of-custody protocol.
Samples will be analyzed for VOCs, including isopropanol, by EPA Method TO-15.

4.4.2 SVE Well Installation and Sampling

A total of ten SVE wells are proposed in the six locations shown on Figures 5 through 7. Each location will
consist of one shallow and one deeper well location. The wells by depth include:
Well VEMF-1 screened in shallow soil from 5-10 ft bgs.

Wells VEMF-1A, VEMF-2A, VEMF-3A and VEMF-4A screened in deeper soil from 15 to 20 ft
bgs. The wells will be screened from approximately 15 to 20 ft bgs within permeable material just
above the clay layer where PCE impact has previously been detected in deeper soil gas wells
SGMF-3-25 and SGMF-4-25.

Deeper wells VEMF-2B, VEMF-3B, VEMF-4B, VEMF-5B, and VEMF-6B will be screened from
28 to 36 ft bgs within the upper part of the historical perched groundwater zone. These deeper well
locations will function as SVE wells if elevated VOCs and limited groundwater is encountered (or
as groundwater monitoring wells if significant groundwater is present).
5 All boring locations will be cleared to 5 ft bgs using a hand-auger and advanced to depth using hollow-stem
auger drilling equipment. All wells will be constructed with 2-inch diameter, Schedule 40 PVC casing with
a 0.010-inch slotted screen. A filter pack annulus consisting of #2/12 sand will be placed from the bottom
of the well up to one foot above the top of the well screen. A two-foot well seal of bentonite will be set
above the filter pack. The remaining annular space will be backfilled with Portland cement and finished
with a flush-mounted well box with the oversight of a Zone 7 Water Agency inspector.
At least 48 hours will be allowed to pass after installation before the wells are sampled to allow subsurface
gases to equilibrate. Three casing volumes will be purged from each SVE well prior to sampling using a
portable blower/sampling pump. A vapor sample will be collected for the SVE extraction piping using a

certified 1-Liter summa canister. SVE well samples will be transported to a California-certified laboratory
under chain-of-custody protocol. Samples will be analyzed for VOCs by EPA Method TO-15.

4.5 Investigation Derived Waste

Investigation derived waste (IDW) generated during field activities will consist of soil from drilling
activities and water from decontamination and well development activities. IDW will be temporarily stored
on site in 55-gallon drums pending profiling and transportation to an appropriate disposal facility.

5.0 SCHEDULE AND REPORTING

In accordance with the Site project schedule and to support Site development, Pangea intends to implement
the proposed assessment activities in June 2021. Pangea will prepare a Data Gap Investigation Report upon
completion of the proposed assessment activities. The report will document assessment activities, tabulate
analytical data, compare results to applicable ESLs, and provide conclusions and recommendations. Report
figures will include key analytical results. Field sampling forms, laboratory analytical reports, chain-of-
custody documentation, and waste disposal manifests will be provided as appendices. The report will be
reviewed for accuracy and completeness and stamped by a California state-registered engineer or geologist.

Subject: Approval of Site Assessment and Summary Report and Site History Technical Report and Request for Data Gap Workplan and Interim Remedial Action Plan - Old Train Depot, 20, 22 & 24 S. L Street & 2009 to 2073 Railroad Ave, Livermore, Alameda County
Dear Mr. Lanphier:
This letter approves the April 18, 2020, Site Assessment and Summary Report (Site Assessment) and May 22, 2020, Site History Technical Report (Report) submitted by the City of Livermore (City) in response to the Regional Water Board's April 24,2020,. directive letter. As explained below, we request the City submit a Data Gap Assessment Workplan and an Interim Remedial Action Plan for the Old Train Depot (Site).
Background
The Site is located within the Livermore Downtown Core Development project area and historically was used as a lumber yard and a train depot with multiple railroad lines. Prospective development of the Site consists of multiple residential and commercial buildings and a Veteran's park.
Soil, groundwater, and soil vapor sampling were conducted at the Site to assess the presence of chemicals from operations at and nearby the Site. Nearby properties historically included a dry cleaner, auto body operations, and other commercial and industrial uses. Results of investigations conducted since 2009 identified select metals in soil, petroleum hydrocarbons in soil and groundwater, and volatile organic compounds, including tetrachloroethene (PCE) and its breakdown products, in groundwater and soil vapor. The Deep Zone groundwater (approximately 100 to 390 feet below ground surface [bgs]) is used by the California Water Service for drinking
water. The closest water supply well is located approximately ½ mile downgradient of the Site and is reportedly screened from 22 to 192 feet bgs. The Report concludes the
following:

Soil containing metals at concentrations greater than environmental screening levels will require management during site grading and use.

Exhibit C
67

Additional action, focused on soil vapor and groundwater, is warranted to assess, remediate, and/or mitigate PCE and its breakdown products at the Site.

Comments

• Water Board staff concur with the Report's conclusions that soil management will be necessary during Site development and that additional assessment is needed to further characterize the extent of PCE and its breakdown products in soil vapor and groundwater.
Water Board staff request additional evaluation be conducted to assess whether operations as a lumber yard could have impacted the Site. Chemicals historically used to treat lumber (e.g., pentachlorophenol, dioxin) could potentially have been
released if treated lumber was stored at the Site or if lumber was treated onsite.
Prior to construction and Site redevelopment, a Site Management Plan that has
been reviewed and approved by the Water Board will be necessary to address handling, management, and disposal of contaminated media during construction activities.

Request for Data Gap Assessment Workplan and Interim Remedial Action Plan The Water Board requests the City submit the following two reports:
1. Data Gap Assessment Workplan (Workplan) 2. Interim Remedial Action Plan (IRAP).
No deadline is set for submittal of these documents; however, we request the City work with the Water Board case manager to submit the reports in a reasonable timeframe.
The Workplan should propose soil, groundwater, and/or soil vapor sampling to collect data that will fill identified data gaps and develop a robust conceptual site model (CSM) considering the proposed future use of the Site. The Workplan should include the rationale for the proposed investigative activities, sampling locations, sampling methods, and analytical testing methods.
The IRAP should present the results of the investigation conducted under the Workplan, including, but not limited to maps showing sampling locations and chemical
concentration data, tabulated data, lithologic logs, and analytical laboratory reports. In addition. the IRAP should include the updated CSM and describe the remedial alternatives evaluated, remedial alternative selected, and proposed implementation method and timeframe.

The City is required to submit all documents in electronic format to the State Water Resources Control Board's GeoTracker database, pursuant to the California Code of Regulations (Title 23, Section 3890, et seq.). See Electronic Submittal of Information for guidance on submitting documents to GeoTracker. Please note that this requirement includes all analytical data, monitoring well information (latitudes, longitudes, elevations, and water depth), site maps, and boring logs.

Exhibit C
68

Basis for Request The information required in these reports is needed to further understand the extent of site contamination and identify remedial options that can reduce or eliminate future
impacts to human health or water quality from site contamination. The City is named in its capacity as the current landowner.

STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE FOR "MICROPURGE" LOW FLOW
GROUNDWATER SAMPLING

1.0 PURPOSE
This standard operating procedure (SOP) describes the procedures for conducting "micropurge" low flow groundwater sampling. This SOP is based on Puls and Barcelona, 1996.
2.0 EQUIPMENT
Low-flow purging/sampling pump. Equipment to be used may include (in decreasing order of preference): dedicated bladder or Grundfos Rediflo pump, peristaltic pump (shallow water table only), non-dedicated bladder or Grundfos Rediflo pump
pH meter
EC meter

Digital thermometer
Flow-through cell and DO meter (optional, depending on site requirements)
Sample vials and preservatives appropriate for analytical methods
Sample labels
Cooler with bagged ice
Record-keeping materials
Latex or nitrile gloves
3.0 WATER LEVEL MEASUREMENTS
1. Remove all well caps. Do NOT sound the total depth of the wells until after completion of sampling (this step may stir up sediment).
2. Allow each well to equilibrate to atmospheric pressure for at least 30 minutes (this step is not necessary for stovepipe wells with vented casings).
3. During equilibration, take water levels at approximately 10-minute intervals to assess the water level stability. Note changes and stability of the water level. Allow additional time for equilibration at any wells that do not exhibit stable readings over a 10-minute interval.
4. Record final water level after water level has stabilized.
4.0 EQUIPMENT CALIBRATION
Calibrate all meters according to manufacturer's instructions prior to sampling. Record calibration in field notes.

Exhibit C
71

l

5.0 WELL PURGING
The validity of the micropurging method is based on strict adherence to the following purging and sampling requirements:
Mixing of the water column within the well prior to and during purging and sampling is minimized by not inserting pumps and bailers into the well (or minimizing insertion).
The pump intake (or suction tubing) for both purging and sampling is positioned at the target sampling depth within the water column, and not so deep as to agitate sediment near the bottom of the well.
Drawdown within the well is minimized by pumping at low rates (typically 0.1 to 0.5 liters per minute [0.025 to 0.125 gpm]).
Purge volume is determined by the stabilization of indicator parameters (primarily electric conductivity [EC], pH and dissolved oxygen [DO] or turbidity) within specific criteria.

1. Pump Insertion. If a dedicated pump is installed in the well, take care not to move the pump up or down within the water column. If no dedicated pump is present, lower the pump or peristaltic suction tube slowly to the specific sampling depth required (generally within the upper half of the screened section) and secure. Do not allow the pump to drop into the bottom half of the water column.
2. Purging. Initiate purging at a rate no greater than 0.5 liters per minute [0.125 gpm]. Monitor the water level during purging and reduce the flow rate if the drawdown below static water level approaches 0.3 feet. The objective is to not exceed 0.33 feet of drawdown during purging. Periodically record water depth and volume measurements.
3. Stabilization. At a minimum, monitor EC, pH, and either DO or turbidity, preferably using a flow-through cell. ORP may also be monitored. Stabilization has been reached when three successive readings taken 3 to 5 minutes apart are within the following. tolerances for ALL parameters (EC +3%, pH +0.1, DO or turbidity +10%, ORP +10mv).
4. Sampling. Sampling should be conducted as soon as stabilization has been reached or a maximum purge volume of 3 casing volumes for a 4" well, or 5 casing volumes for a 2" well has been reached. Collect samples by disconnecting the flow-through cell and directing the pump tubing outlet flow directly into the sample containers.
5. Shipment. Place samples in a cooler with bagged ice and ship under chain-of-custody to the project laboratory.

STANDARD FIELD PROCEDURES FOR MONITORING WELLS
This document describes Pangea Environmental Services' standard field methods for drilling, installing, developing and sampling groundwater monitoring wells. These procedures are designed to comply with
Federal, State and local regulatory guidelines. Specific field procedures are summarized below.
Well Construction and Surveying
Groundwater in monitoring wells are installed in soil borings to monitor groundwater quality and determine to the groundwater elevation, flow direction and gradient. Well depths and screen lengths are based on groundwater depth, occurrence of hydrocarbons or other compounds in the borehole, stratigraphy and State and local regulatory guidelines. Well screens typically extend 10 to 15 feet below and 5 feet above the static water level at the time of drilling. However, the well screen will generally not extend into or through a clay or
layer that is at least three feet thick.

Well casing and screen are flush-threaded, Schedule 40 PVC. Screen slot size varies according to the sediments screened, but slots are generally 0.010 or 0.020 inches A wide. A rinsed and graded sand occupies
the annular space between the boring and the well screen to about one to ft two ft above the well screen. A
two feet thick hydrated bentonite seal separates the sand from the overlying sanitary surface seal composed of Portland type II cement.
Well-heads are secured by locking well-caps inside traffic-rated vaults finished flush with the ground
surface. A stovepipe may be installed between the well-head and the vault cap for additional security. The well top-of-casing elevation is surveyed with respect to mean sea level and the well is surveyed for horizontal location with respect to an onsite or nearby offsite landmark.

Well Development
Wells are generally developed using a combination of groundwater surging and extraction. Surging agitates the groundwater and dislodges fine sediments from the sand pack. Wells may be surged prior to installation of the well seal to ensure that there are no voids in the sand pack. Development occurs 48 to 72 hours after seal installation to ensure that the Portland cement has set up correctly. After about ten minutes of surging, groundwater is extracted from the well using bailing, pumping and/or reverse air-lifting through an eductor pipe to remove the sediments from the well. Surging and extraction continue until at least ten well-casing volumes of groundwater are extracted and the sediment volume in the groundwater is negligible.
All equipment is steam-cleaned prior to use and air used for air-lifting is filtered to prevent oil entrained in
the compressed air from entering the well. Wells that are developed using air-lift evacuation are not
sampled until at least 72 hours after they are developed.

Groundwater Sampling
Depending on local regulatory guidelines, three to four well-casing volumes of groundwater are purged
prior to sampling. Purging continues until groundwater pH, conductivity, and temperature have stabilized. Groundwater samples are collected using bailers or pumps and are decanted into the appropriate containers supplied by the analytic laboratory. Samples are labeled, placed in protective foam sleeves, stored on crushed ice at or below 4°C, and transported under chain-of-custody to the laboratory. Laboratory-supplied trip blanks accompany the samples and are analyzed to check for cross-contamination. An equipment blank may be analyzed if non-dedicated sampling equipment is used.

STANDARD FIELD PROCEDURES FOR SOIL BORINGS

This document describes Pangea Environmental Services' standard field methods for drilling and sampling soil borings, used to facilitate for soil sampling, grab groundwater sampling, or well installation. These procedures are to designed to comply with Federal, State and local regulatory guidelines. Specific field procedures are summarized below.

Objectives
Soil samples are collected to characterize subsurface lithology, assess whether the soils exhibit obvious hydrocarbon or other compound vapor odor or staining, estimate ground water depth and quality, and to submit samples for chemical analysis.
Soil Classification/Logging
All soil samples are classified according to the Unified Soil Classification System by a trained geologist, scientist or engineer working under the supervision of a California Registered Engineer, California Registered Geologist (RG) or a Certified Engineering Geologist (CEG). The following soil properties are noted for each soil sample:
Principal and secondary grain size category (i.e. sand, silt, clay or gravel)
Approximate percentage of each grain size category,
Color,
Approximate water or product saturation percentage, Observed odor and/or discoloration,
Other significant observations (i.e. cementation, presence of marker horizons, mineralogy), and Estimated permeability.
Soil Boring and Sampling
Soil borings are typically drilled using hollow-stem augers or hydraulic-push technologies. At least one and one half ft of the soil column is collected for every five ft of drilled depth. Additional soil samples are typically collected near the water table and at lithologic changes and observed zones of potential contamination. With hollow-stem drilling, samples are collected using brass/stainless steel tubes lining a split-barrel or equivalent samplers driven into undisturbed sediments beyond the bottom of the borehole. With hydraulic-push drilling, soil samples are typically collected using acetate liners. Sampling tubes or cut acetate liners chosen for analysis are trimmed of excess soil and capped with Teflon tape and plastic end caps. Soil samples can also be collected using a TerraCore sampling device in accordance with EPA Method 5035. Terracore soil sampling involves the collection of an approximately 5-g soil sample which is placed in a pre-weighed vial with a septum-sealed screw cap that contains a sodium bisulfate or methanol preservation solution.
The vertical location of each soil sample is determined by measuring the distance from the middle of the soil sample tube to the end of the drive rod used to advance the or split barrel sampler or the acetate tube. All sample depths use the ground surface immediately adjacent to the boring as a datum. The horizontal location of each boring is measured in the field from an onsite permanent reference using a measuring wheel or tape measure.
Drilling and sampling equipment is steam-cleaned prior to drilling and between borings to prevent cross- contamination. Sampling equipment is washed between samples with trisodium phosphate or an equivalent EPA- approved detergent.
Sample Storage, Handling and Transport
Soil samples are labeled and stored at or below 4°C on either crushed or dry ice, depending upon local regulations. Samples are transported under chain-of-custody to a State-certified analytical laboratory.

Exhibit C
74

Field Screening
Soil samples collected during drilling will be analyzed in the field for ionizable organic compounds using a photo- ionization detector a (PID) with a 10.2 eV lamp. The screening procedure will involve placing an undisturbed soil sample in a sealed container (either a zip-lock bag, glass jar, or a capped soil tube). The container will be set aside,
or preferably in the sun warm location. After approximately fifteen minutes, the head space within the container will be tested for total organic vapor, measured in parts per million on a volume to volume basis (ppmv) by the PID. The PID instrument will be calibrated prior to boring using hexane or isobutylene. PID measurements are used along with the field observations, odors, stratigraphy and ground water depth to select soil samples for analysis.
Water Sampling
Water samples collected from borings are either collected from the open borehole, from within screened PVC inserted into the borchole, or from driven Hydropunch-type sampler. Groundwater is typically extracted using a bailer, check valve and/or a peristaltic pump. The ground water samples are decanted into the appropriate containers supplied by the analytic laboratory. Samples are labeled, placed in protective foam in sleeves, stored on crushed ice at
or below 4°C, and transported under chain-of-custody to the laboratory.
Pangea often performs electrical conductivity (EC) logging and/or continuous coring to identify potential water- bearing zones. Hydropunch-type sampling is then performed to provide discrete-depth grab groundwater sampling within potential water-bearing zones for vertical contaminant delineation. Hydropunch-type sampling typically involves driving cylindrical sheath of hardened steel with an expendable drive point to the desired depth within undisturbed soil. The sheath is retracted to expose a stainless steel or PVC screen that is sealed inside the sheath with Neoprene O-rings to prevent infiltration of formation fluids until the desired depth is attained. The groundwater is extracted using tubing inserted down the center of the rods into the screened sampler.
Duplicates and Blanks
Blind duplicate water samples are collected usually collected only for monitoring well sampling programs, at a rate of one blind sample for every 10 wells sampled. Laboratory-supplied trip blanks accompany samples collected for all sampling programs to check for cross-contamination caused by sample handling and transport. These trip blanks
are analyzed if the internal laboratory QA/QC blanks contain the suspected field contaminants. An equipment blank
may also be analyzed if non-dedicated sampling equipment is used.
Grouting
If the borings are not completed as wells, the borings are filled to the ground surface with cement grout poured or pumped through a tremie pipe. For borings used as wells, wells constructed in the borehole and grouted in
accordance with well specifications.
Waste Handling and Disposal
Soil cuttings from drilling activities are usually stockpiled onsite on top of and covered by plastic sheeting. At least four individual soil samples are collected from the stockpiles for later compositing at the analytic laboratory. The composite sample is analyzed for the same constituents analyzed in the borehole samples. Soil cuttings are transported by licensed waste haulers and disposed in secure, licensed facilities based on composite analytic results.
Ground water removed during sampling and/or rinsate generated during decontamination procedures are stored onsite in sealed 55 gallon drums. Each drum is labeled with the drum number, date of generation, suspected
contents, generator identification and consultant contact. Disposal of the water is based on the analytic results for the
well samples. The water is either pumped out using a vacuum truck for transport to a licensed waste
treatment/disposal facility or the individual drums are picked up and transported to the waste facility where the drum
contents are removed and appropriately disposed.

Re: May 24, 2021, City Council Meeting: Eden Housing's Downtown Livermore
Apartments Project (DDR 20-019; VTPM 11186 - SUB 21-003)
Dear Mayor Woerner and Honorable Councilmembers:
On behalf of Save Livermore Downtown, we appreciate the opportunity to provide written comments on Eden Housing's request for the City Council's approval of Downtown Design Review and Vesting Tentative Parcel Map ("VTPM") to develop the western portion of the Downtown Core site in the Downtown Specific Plan area with 130 apartment units (the "Project"). Save Livermore Downtown is a community organization dedicated to a vision of the heart of the City that would improve the quality of life for the whole community.
As an initial matter, Save Livermore Downtown wants to make clear that they understand and agree that more affordable housing projects need to be built in Livermore to address the statewide, regional, and local housing and homelessness challenges. In fact, Save Livermore Downtown supports affordable housing at a nearby location, one where even more units could be built. What concerns Save Livermore Downtown is turning the focal point of Livermore's Downtown Core into two massive walls of development that overwhelm the park within it. Eden's proposed plan would not revitalize the Downtown Core. It would not provide the public with an expansive community gathering space and a regional draw that could benefit all the cultural and commercial elements in the Downtown Core, and tie them together.
Indeed, the Project as currently designed violates development standards set forth in the Downtown Specific Plan and other City planning documents. Although the City can provide Eden with up to four incentives as part of the Project's density bonus request (if so requested by Eden), the Project needs far more than four incentives to proceed as currently designed. Additionally, because land proposed for nonresidential uses and/or that will be dedicated to the
City as parkland cannot be included in gross acreage for density calculations, Eden must revise its density bonus request to ask for relief from the density limitations set forth in the Specific Plan.

The Project also runs afoul of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Heavy industrial uses previously occurred on the Project site, and the San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board now oversees cleanup at the site due to historical contamination. Save Livermore Downtown is concerned that development on the site will exacerbate the hazardous environmental condition and cause further unknown impacts, including on potential future residents. The City must evaluate these potential impacts prior to approval of the Project.
Notwithstanding the legal issues identified herein, the City Council a has a real opportunity now to listen to its constituents who overwhelmingly oppose the Project as it is currently configured. Save Livermore Downtown has proposed : feasible and preferred alternative to the Project that would relocate the 130 units off the old Lucky site to seven parcels north of Railroad Avenue, which could support another 100 affordable units, protect the character of the
Downtown Core, and enable the development of a beautiful park. It would provide housing options for low-, very low- and extremely low-income households, as well as teachers and other community members with moderate incomes. (See attached information regarding Downtown Alternative attached hereto as Exhibit A).
For these reasons, and as discussed more fully below, Save Livermore Downtown urges City Council to deny Eden's request for Downtown Design Review and a VTPM for the Project and to engage with both constituents and Eden to make the Downtown Alternative, or a similar
alternative project, a reality.

I. THE PROJECT VIOLATES THE DENSITY BONUS LAW AND IS
INCONSISTENT WITH THE DOWNTOWN SPECIFIC PLAN

The California Density Bonus law (Government Code Sections 65915-65918), as implemented through Livermore Development Code Section 6.02.030, provides for increased project densities and developer incentives for development projects that provide a certain percentage of affordable units. Under this statute, a city must grant a density increase the percentage of which is dependent on the type of development-over the otherwise maximum allowable residential density to a developer who agrees to build or rehabilitate housing in accordance with the Density Bonus Law's affordability requirements. An applicant that qualifies for density bonus may also request development concessions or incentives, even if a density bonus is not requested. Concessions or incentives may include a reduction in site development standards or a modification of zoning code or architectural design requirements (including a reduction in setbacks, square footage requirements, required parking, or architectural design requirements), approval of mixed-use zoning in conjunction with the housing project, and other regulatory incentives or concessions that result in identifiable and actual cost reductions to
provide for affordable housing costs or rents. (Gov't Code § 65915(f), (k).)
However, a developer is not entitled to an unlimited number of incentives; rather, the number of incentives received is tied to the percentage of affordable units provided. Here, because the Project will provide 100% lower-income units, it is entitled to receive maximum of four incentives or concessions. (See Gov't Code § 65915(d)(2).)

US-DOCS\123989204 Exhibit D

LATHAM&WATKINSLP

Because the Project requires more than four incentives or concessions to comply with applicable required development and design standards and objectives in the Downtown Specific Plan, the Project as currently designed does not conform to the Density Bonus Law and 1S inconsistent with the Specific Plan. Accordingly, the City Council cannot approve Downtown Design Review for the Project.
Parking. As discussed in the Staff Report for the April 20, 2021 Planning Commission hearing on the Project ("Planning Commission Staff Report"), Eden needs at least four separate and distinct parking-related incentives for the Project: (1) offsite unit parking location (in L Street garage); (2) reduction in unit parking space in quantity (to 1:1 ratio); (3) reduction in compact parking space dimension (from 18 to 16 feet depth), and (4) reduction in standard parking space width (from 8.5 to 8.0 feet for 100% of the parking stalls). (Planning Commission Staff Report, p. 20.) But the City incorrectly characterizes these requests as one incentive under the umbrella of "parking" as a whole. (Ibid.) Because Eden is requesting relief from several different development standards, they cannot be lumped together as one incentive. (See Gov't Code § 65915(k) [examples of incentives are specific, individual requests]; Friends of Lagoon Valley v. City of Vacaville (2007) 154 Cal.App.4th 807, 824 [under the Density Bonus Law, "the city or county must grant the developer one or more itemized concessions"] [emphasis added].) Accordingly, to the extent Eden still requests these parking-related incentives, each must be treated individually as a separate incentive.
Site Frontage. The Downtown Specific Plan allows a building on the Project site to be four stories tall so long as the "fourth floor does not extend for more than 60% of
the site frontage along L Street, Railroad Avenue and South Livermore Avenue."
(Downtown Specific Plan, Ch. 5a, § 4.1.D.5.e.) The Planning Commission Staff Report stated that both Project buildings will "occupy approximately 33 percent of the catalyst project site frontage along L Street, Railroad Avenue, and South Livermore Avenue when taken as i whole." (Planning Commission Staff Report, p. 13.) But this conclusion misapplies the standard. Because the Project does not front on Livermore Avenue, only the frontage on Railroad Avenue and L Street is relevant. And the fourth floor extends more than 60% of the total site frontage on those portions of the site along Railroad Avenue and L Street. Therefore, the Project is inconsistent with this standard in the Specific Plan. Eden must either seek a density bonus incentive to allow deviation from this site frontage standard or change the design of the Project. Otherwise, the City Council cannot approve Design Review for the Project, as it cannot find the Project to be consistent with the Specific Plan.
Overall Building Massing. The Downtown Specific Plan also sets forth the objective that for multi-family residential buildings, "[t]he massing of larger residential buildings shall be broken down to convey a sense of 'home', and give individuality to

US-DOCS\23989204 Exhibit D
80

City of Livermore City Council
May 18, 2021

LATHAM&WATKINSLP

each unit that lies within it." (Downtown Specific Plan, Ch. 6c, p. 6-32.)' The Specific Plan also sets forth certain standards to meet this objective, including that: (1) "[m]ultifamily buildings shall avoid a monotonous or overscaled massing, i.e. a *project' appearance," and (2) "[b]uilding massing shall be subdivided into portions or segments compatible with the adjacent residential scale." (Ibid.)
The Project disregards these required standards. No effort has been made to give individuality to the units or groups of units. The lack of residential features makes it difficult to identify the building as residential, let alone full of individual units.
Additionally, just to the west of the Project L across L street, the Legacy Apartments incorporate balconies and porches that provide architectural relief. The Project design does not. The Project is inconsistent with the above-mentioned standards governing massing in the Specific Plan. Eden must therefore either seek an additional density bonus incentive from the City to allow deviation from these standards or modify the design of the building, or the City Council cannot approve Design Review for the Project.
Setbacks. The Downtown Specific Plan states that the maximum street frontage setback for a building on the Project site is 20 feet. (Downtown Specific Plan, Ch. 5a, § 5.1.B.) While the Staff Report asserts that the smallest setback is feet (Planning Commission Staff Report, p. 13), it does not address the fact that the North Building's setback along segments of the frontage of Railroad Avenue exceeds the maximum allowable 20 feet. Specifically, the Site Plan for the Project shows that in places along Railroad Avenue, there is a setback of 24 feet, and the setback where the
driveway entrance is located is over 35 feet. (Site Plan, p. A.2 [attached to Planning Commission Staff Report], a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B.) Because the Project is not in compliance with the setback standards of the Specific Plan, Eden must seek another density bonus incentive to allow deviation from these standards or
change its design.

Main Entrance/Siting and Orientation. Regarding the entrance for the Project, the Specific Plan sets forth two objectives: (1) entrances must "convey a clear residential character, one that is welcoming to the building's tenants;" and (2) buildings must "be sited to reinforce the public street network of Downtown, aligning with primary street frontages and public pathways." (Downtown Specific Plan, Ch. 6c, pp. 6-32, 6-35.) It also sets forth the related and required standards that "[p]rimary entrances to multi- unit buildings [must] front onto the primary street" and that "the backs of buildings shall not face public streets." (Ibid.) According to the Project's Site Plan, the lobby of the Project will be located on the park side of the North Building and will not face any primary street. (Site Plan, pp. A.2, A.4 [see Exhibit B].) Thus, the main lobby entrance faces inward, and the back of the building will face Railroad Avenue, a major public street. (Ibid.) Because the Project is not in compliance with these two

1 "All projects are required to comply with identified obiectives and standards and are strongly encouraged to follow the established guidelines." (Downtown Specific Plan, Ch. 6c, p. 6-31 [emphasis added].)

separate but related entrance and orientation standards of the Specific Plan, Eden must seek two density bonus incentives to allow deviation from these standards, or change its design to conform to them.
Windows. The Specific Plan states that "IbJuildings shall include vertically proportioned façade openings, with windows that have a greater height than width (an appropriate vertical/horizontal ratio ranges from 1.5:1 to 2:1." (Downtown Specific Plan, Ch. 6c, p. 6-43.) The Project does not comply with this standard. The elevations and renderings for the Project clearly demonstrate a large number of windows that are wider horizontally than vertically. (See Planning Commission Staff Report, pp. A.15-A.18, A.23-A.30.)
Horizontal Mass. The Downtown Specific Plan requires that "[h]orizontal mass shall be broken down to create architectural interest and provide visual separation between units or modules of units." (Downtown Specific Plan, Ch. 6c, p. 6-33.) Moreover, the Specific Plan requires that facades of long buildings be "architecturally subdivided into shorter segments every twenty-five (25) to fifty (50) feet maximum, using the methods noted" in Guidelines provided therein. (Ibid.) The Project does not comply with these requirements either. The design does not provide visual separation between units, and because of the lack of architectural features identifying individual units, it also is impossible to tell whether there are separate modules of units. For instance, the Specific Plan provides the following example of long buildings architecturally subdivided into shorter segments:

Long buildings should be architecturally
subdivided into shorter segments.

The Project makes no attempt to comply with this requirement, and instead resembles a large, uniform wall with no distinctions for individual units, and without individualized roof forms.

Private Open Space. The Specific Plan requires the Project to provide sixty (60) square feet of private open space per residential unit on-site. (Downtown Specific Plan, Ch. 5a, § 6.3.B.) Private open space includes "balconies or patios accessible only to the dwelling/dwellings served." (Id., § 6.3 [emphasis added].) In other words, private open space within a development project cannot be accessed by the general public. The Project does not comply with this requirements. Although the cover

US-DOCS\123989204 Exhibit D
82

City of Livermore City Council
May 18, 2021
Page 6

LATHAM&WATKINS LP

sheet to the Project plans states that the Project includes open terraces for the north and south buildings, based on the remainder of the plan set included with the
Planning Commission Staff Report, including the renderings of the buildings, there is no indication that these areas are provided only to the Project's residential dwellings. Indeed, the renderings show frontages along the south side of the north building and the north side of the south building that are not separated from the public park in the middle, and are simply integrated into the park seamlessly. This does not qualify as private open space. Eden must revise the Project to clearly delineate the location of private open space accessible only to residents of the Project, and if it cannot provide the required 60 square feet per unit, it must seck a density bonus incentive to deviate from this requirement.
As shown above, the Project has several inconsistencies with the development and design standards and objectives in the Specific Plan. Because the City cannot grant the Project more than four incentives under the Density Bonus Law, even should the Project maximize its incentive requests, the Project will continue to remain inconsistent with the Specific Plan. Therefore, the City Council cannot approve Eden's request for Downtown Design Review and make findings that the Project is consistent with the Specific Plan. Approval of the request would be an abuse of discretion.

Further, the Project must also seek a density increase from the City. Under the Downtown Specific Plan the maximum density is 55 units per acre within the Downtown Core, calculated on a project-wide basis. (Specific Plan, Ch. 5a, § 3.1.A.) The General Plan allows for residential density to be calculated on a gross acreage basis, incorporating one half of the right- of-way width along the longest project street frontage. However, "[t]he gross acre does not include any of the following: (1) land that is to be purchased by a public agency; (2) land required for parkland dedication; or (3) land proposed for non-residential uses." (General Plan, Ch. 3 Land Use Element, p. 3-10 [emphasis added].)
According to the Staff Report, the City calculated the gross acreage of the site as 2.5 acres, "which includes all three proposed parcels." (Staff Report, p. 7.) Based on this calculation, it then concludes that "[t]his yields a residential density of 52 units per acre, consistent with the Downtown Specific Plan density range." (Ibid.) This calculation is incorrect because it includes Parcel 2, which houses the public park and which will be dedicated to the
City. In addition, a public park is not a residential use. In accordance with the General Plan, it should therefore be excluded from gross acreage. Because removal of Parcel 2 will remove roughly three-quarters of an acre, the Project must revise its density bonus request to ask for relief from the density rules.

II. THE PROJECT VIOLATES CEQA
The Planning Commission Staff Report recommended the City determine that the Project is exempt from CEQA under Government Code Section 65457 and CEQA Guidelines Section 15182(c). Under this section, a residential project implementing a Specific Plan is exempt from CEQA review if (1) an agency has prepared an EIR on a Specific Plan after January 1, 1980, (2) the residential project conforms to the Specific Plan, and (3) no events under Public Resources

US-DOCS\123989204 Exhibit D

LATHAM&WATKINS.P

Code Section 21166 have occurred since the adoption of the Specific Plan. (Gov't Code § 65457(a).)

As an initial matter, as described above, the Project does not conform to the Specific Plan, even if Eden maximizes its density bonus request. Thus, the City cannot use Government Code Section 65457 and CEQA Guidelines Section 15182(c) as CEQA clearance for the Project.
In addition, the City cannot use this CEQA exemption because the events of Public Resources Code Section 21166 have occurred since adoption of the Specific Plan. Under Public Section 21166, an agency is required to engage in subsequent or supplemental environmental review after certification of an initial EIR when: (1) substantial project changes that will require major revisions to the previous EIR; (2) substantial changes regarding project circumstances that will require major revisions to the previous EIR; or (3) new information of substantial importance that was not known or could not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the previous EIR was certified. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15162(a); Pub. Resources Code, § 21166.) If any of these conditions occur, a subsequent or supplemental EIR must be prepared by "the public agency which grants the next discretionary approval for the project, if any." (Guidelines, §§ 15162, subd. (c) Pub. Resources Code, § 21166); Friends of College of San Mateo Gardens v. San Mateo County Community College Dist. (2016) Cal.5th 937, 944 [if any of these standards are met, "then a subsequent or supplemental EIR is required"].) One of the main purposes behind this requirement "is to explore environmental impacts not considered in the original environmental document." (San Mateo Gardens, supra, 1 Cal.5th at p. 949 [internal quotes omitted].)
The Livermore Downtown Specific Plan and EIR were initially adopted in 2004. In 2009, the City adopted a Downtown Specific Plan Amendment and certified a subsequent EIR (*2009 EIR"). Three addenda were later adopted in March 2019, August 25, 2020, and August 27, 2020, respectively. The Planning Commission Staff Report concludes that the Project is consistent with the EIR for the Downtown Specific Plan and its subsequent amendments, stating that"[t]here is no new information of substantial importance that would result in new impacts not previously discussed, result in more severe impacts, or require modifications to the existing mitigation measures." (Planning Commission Staff Report, p. 23.)
However, recent activity by the San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board (*Regional Board") requires that the City engage in supplemental or subsequent environmental review before approving the Project. Because the Project site was previously subject to heavy industrial uses, the Regional Board now manages cleanup at the site due to historical contamination. Most recently, on February 9, 2021, Regional Board staff issued a letter to the City approving an April 18, 2020, Site Assessment and Summary Report and a May 22, 2020, Site History Technical Report. The February 9 letter from Regional Board staff concluded that "[r]esults of investigations conducted since 2009 identified select metals in soil, petroleum hydrocarbons in soil and groundwater, and volatile organic compounds, including tetrachloroethene (PCE) and its breakdown products, in groundwater and soil vapor." (See

US-DOCS\123989204 Exhibit D
84

City of Livermore City Council
May 18, 2021
Page 8

LATHAM&WATKINSUP

Exhibit C attached hereto.)? As a result, the Regional Board is now requesting that the City submit a Data Gap Assessment Workplan and an Interim Remedial Action Plan. As part of these plans, the City is now required to engage in further data collection, summarize the results of the investigation and data collection, and "describe the remedial alternatives evaluated, remedial alternative selected, and proposed implementation method and timeframe." (Id. at p. 2.)
The 2009 EIR acknowledges that "[i]n general, commercial and industrial land uses in the Downtown Specific Plan area have historically used hazardous materials associated with railroad operations, service stations, dry cleaners, fuel storage, and machine shops." (2009 Subsequent EIR, p. 231.)3 It then addresses several specific sites in the Downtown area affected
by hazardous materials, including: (1) the First Street/South Livermore Avenue site; (2) the Livermore Village site; and (3) the Railroad Avenue Realignment and First Street/Maple Street site. With respect to the Livermore Village site, which appears to encompass the Project site (see id. at p. 234), the 2009 EIR concluded that former railroad operations may have impacted soil and groundwater with heavy metals, petroleum hydrocarbons, and pesticides. (Ihid.) In addition, it noted that historical dry cleaning operations took place at the site, and that a 1988 gasoline release and 1991 leaking UST occurred nearby, but concluded none of these would likely affect development "of the Theater at the Livermore Village site." (Id. at pp. 235-236.) At a general-program level and, as applicable to the Livermore Village site, the EIR recommended the following mitigation measures: (1) preparation of a Soil Management Plan prior to the issuance of grading permits; (2) preparation of a hazardous building materials survey to address loose and peeling lead-based paint and asbestos-containing material; and (3) preparation and implementation of : soil and/or groundwater investigation workplan by a licensed professional to evaluate operation of the Southern Pacific Railroad at the Livermore Village site and Quality Cleaners adjacent to the Livermore Village site. (Id. at pp. 238-244.) With implementation of the mitigation measures, the 2009 EIR concluded that any impacts from
hazardous materials would be less than significant.

The March 2019 Addendum concluded that no new impacts regarding hazardous
materials had occurred since the 2009 Subsequent EIR. It noted that "[t]he review of information available on the State Water Resource Control Board's Geotracker Database and the
Department of Toxic Substances Control's Envirostor Database did not identify other hazardous materials release site which could impact the project site." (2019 Addendum, p. B-40.)4
The August 27, 2020 Addendum to the Downtown Specific Plan EIR also notes that "since the adoption of the March 2019 Addendum, two Cleanup Program Sites, as classified by the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) were identified, and remediation activities have been initiated." (Addendum to the Downtown Specific Plan

dated Aug. 27, 2020, p. 4.)5 However, the August 27 addendum did not specifically address remediation at the Project site, and as discussed above, further remediation activities have since
been required of the City by the Board.
It is clear that there are newfound concerns regarding contamination of the site and the Regional Board recognizes the site has several chemicals of concern in the soil and groundwater, including arsenic, lead, petroleum hydrocarbons, and volatile organic compounds. (See April 18, 2020 Site Assessment and Summary Report - Old Train Depot, dated Apr. 18, 2020 (*April 18 Report"), attached hereto as Exhibit D.)º Specifically, the April 18 Report, which the City's environmental consultant prepared for the City, expresses concern regarding soil vapor intrusion-the release of gas from a toxic chemical in groundwater or soil under the surface rising out of the ground-into the residential structure. (Id. at p. 13.) The April 18 Report notes that certain engineering controls, such as ventilated parking structures, chemical vapor barriers and passive/active subslab ventilation systems, could help protect against such a dangerous hazard. (Ibid.) The Regional Board also stresses that "[a]dditional grab groundwater sampling, well monitoring, and/or additional groundwater monitoring well installation is merited to further characterize and monitor the plume stability of PCE and its degradation products near existing well MW-4, and to evaluate the potential for VOC migration onto the Site from offsite sources." (Ibid.)

Development of the Project will exacerbate the current contamination issues and result in a significant impact on the environment and public health. Although the 2009 EIR requires implementation of a Soil Management Plan and hazardous buildings materials survey, the record before the Regional Board demonstrates more significant and specific concerns regarding vapor intrusion and other contamination.' It is also clear that the 2009 EIR mitigation measures are not sufficient to address these concerns, and the Regional Board recommends additional safeguards above and beyond what are required by the 2009 EIR. That the Regional Board has now adopted the Site and Technical Reports and that the City must engage in additional remediation constitutes substantial new information requiring additional environmental review under CEQA. (See CEQA Guidelines, App'x G [public exposure to hazardous materials may constitute a significant environmental impact].) Moreover, an agency's approval of a remedial action plan is subject to CEQA.

III. CONCLUSION

For all of the reasons discussed above, the Project is not consistent with the Downtown Specific Plan and the Density Bonus Law, and additional CEQA review is required. Therefore, the City Council should deny Eden's request for Downtown Design Review and a VTPM for the Project. Save Downtown Livermore respectfully requests that the City Council consider the

thttps://documents.geotracker.waterboards.ca.gov/regulators/deliverable_documents/9948743522/T10000014462.P DF.
At the time of the March 2019 Addendum, this significant new information from the Regional Board had not yet been made available. And although the August 27, 2020 Addendum was released after the issuance of the April 18 Report, that addendum did not specifically address the Project site.

Re: May 24, 2021, City Council Meeting, Agenda Item 5.2:
Eden Housing Project (DDR 20-019; VTPM 11186 - SUB 21-003)
Dear Mayor Woerner and Honorable Councilmembers:
On behalf of Save Livermore Downtown, this follows up on comments sent to the City Council on May 18, 2021.1 We have reviewed the staff report and associated agenda materials for Eden Housing's request for Downtown Design Review and a Vesting Tentative Parcel Map ("VTPM") to develop the western portion of the Downtown Core site in the Downtown Specific Plan area with 130 affordable residential apartment units (the "Project"). Despite the voluminous materials included with the staff report and the clarification that Eden now seeks a density bonus incentive to exceed the maximum setback requirement in the Downtown Specific Plan, Save Livermore Downtown still has numerous concerns with the Project that have not been addressed or rectified by the City or Eden.
For the reasons set forth below, and explained in further detail in Attachment A to this letter, the City Council cannot approve the Project in its current form.
The staff report makes clear that the design of the Project has not changed since the Planning Commission considered it last month. The Project's design continues to be inconsistent with the Downtown Specific Plan in several ways, and Eden has not requested density bonus incentives to address these inconsistencies. The City cannot approve Downtown Design Review for the Project as it is currently designed.

Denial of the Project would not violate the Housing Accountability Act ("HAA"), as the City Attorney claims. The HAA does not prevent the City from denying a project when it will have a specific, adverse impact on public health and safety. Such

The comments made in the May 18, 2021, letter are incorporated herein by reference.

impacts are present here due to soil and groundwater contamination, and the presence of soil vapor gas intrusion, for which mitigation measures may prove infeasible and unaffordable.

The Project is not exempt from CEQA review, as (1) it does not satisfy the requirements of the statutory exemption pursuant to Government Code 65457 due to its inconsistencies with the Downtown Specific Plan; and (2) the categorical exemptions claimed by staff are inapplicable and defeated by the presence of unusual
circumstances.

For these reasons, and as discussed in Attachment A, should the City Council approve the Project at its May 24 meeting, it would be doing so unlawfully. Save Livermore Downtown does not want to be forced to seek judicial relief from the City's unlawful actions, but at this point it feels as though its many voices are being and have been completely ignored, and thus reserves all of its rights to do so. Save Livermore Downtown urges the City and Eden to
recognize the overwhelming community opposition to this Project, and to put a pause on the Project and come to the table to discuss a feasible and preferred alternative to the Project, whether through mediation, community meetings, or some other approach. As discussed in our May 18 letter, one or more alternatives exist that would enable the 130 units to be relocated off
the old Lucky site to a different location that could support even more affordable units.
Save Downtown Livermore respectfully requests that the City Council deny the Project
or, at the very least, continue the hearing to a future date in order to consider the alternative
proposed by Save Livermore Downtown, or another similar project alternative. The overwhelming majority of Livermore's residents feel that the Project would be more appropriately sited, and could provide additional affordable housing options, at a different location, which would preserve the Downtown Core for large public park for residents and visitors to enjoy.
Very truly yours, Ato Staz Winston Stromberg
of LATHAM & WATKINS LLP

ATTACHMENT A

I. THE PROJECT REMAINS INCONSISTENT WITH THE DOWNTOWN
SPECIFIC PLAN

Our May 18, 2021, letter explained the many ways the Project is inconsistent with the Downtown Specific Plan's required development and design standards and objectives.3 Those inconsistencies were based on the design plans for the Project included with the staff report for the Planning Commission's hearing in April 2021. The City Council Staff Report ("Staff Report") states that "[n]o physical changes have been made to the project since review by the Planning Commission." While the Staff Report acknowledges that Eden has requested a density bonus incentive to allow the Project to exceed the maximum setback permitted in the Downtown Specific Plan, it claims that Project otherwise complies with the Specific Plan. That is incorrect. As a result, the City cannot make the finding required for Downtown Design Review approval that "[t]he project is in conformance with the Specific Plan's standards and guidelines."
The Project is inconsistent with the Specific Plan in many ways, including, but not limited to:

Main Entrance/Siting and Orientation. Regarding the entrance for the Project, the Specific Plan sets forth two objectives: (1) entrances must "convey a clear residential character, one that is welcoming to the building's tenants;" and (2) buildings must "be sited to reinforce the public street network of Downtown, aligning with primary street frontages and public pathways." (Specific Plan, Ch. 6c, pp. 6-32, 6-35.) It also sets forth the related and required standards that "[p]rimary entrances to multi-unit buildings [must] front onto the primary street" and that "the backs of buildings shall not face public streets." (Ibid.) According to the Project's Site Plan, the lobby of the Project will be located on the park side of the North Building and will not face any
primary street. (Site Plan, pp. A.2, A.4.) Thus, the main lobby entrance faces inward, and the back of the building will face Railroad Avenue, a major public street. (Ibid.)
Windows. The Specific Plan states that "[b]uildings shall include vertically proportioned façade openings, with windows that have a greater height than width (an appropriate vertical/horizontal ratio ranges from 1.5:1 to 2:1." (Specific Plan, Ch. 6c, p. 6-43.) The Project does not comply with this standard. The elevations and renderings for the Project clearly demonstrate a large number of windows that are wider horizontally than vertically. (See Project Plans, pp. A.15-A.18, A.23-A.30.)
Overall Building Massing. The Downtown Specific Plan also sets forth the objective that for multi-family residential buildings, "[t]he massing of larger residential buildings shall be broken down to convey a sense of 'home', and give individuality to

2 "All projects are required to comply with identified obiectives and standards [in Chapter 6] and are strongly encouraged to follow the established guidelines."* (Downtown Specific Plan, Ch. 6c, p. 6-31 [emphasis added].)

US-DOCS\124142813.3 Exhibit E
91

LATHAM&WATKINS!P

each unit that lies within it." (Specific Plan, Ch. 6c, p. 6-32.) The Specific Plan also sets forth certain standards to meet this objective, including that: (1) "[m]ultifamily buildings shall avoid a monotonous or overscaled massing, i.e.: 'project' appearance," and (2) "[bJuilding massing shall be subdivided into portions or
segments compatible with the adjacent residential scale." (Ibid.) And the Specific Plan contains additional Guidelines requiring "[b]uilding segments .. . to be legible as individual residents or small groups of units," using one or more design techniques. (lbid. [emphasis added].) The Project disregards these objectives, standards and guidelines. No effort has been made to give individuality to the units or groups of units. The lack of residential features makes it difficult to identify the building as residential, let alone full of individual units.

Horizontal Mass. The Downtown Specific Plan requires that "[h]orizontal mass shall be broken down to create architectural interest and provide visual separation between units or modules of units." (Specific Plan, Ch. 6c, p. 6-33.) Moreover, the Specific Plan requires that facades of long buildings be "architecturally subdivided into shorter
segments every twenty-five (25) to fifty (50) feet maximum, using the methods noted"* in Guidelines provided therein. (Ibid.) The Project does not comply with these requirements either. The design does not provide visual separation between
units, and instead resembles a large, uniform wall with no distinctions for individual
units, and without individualized roof forms.

Site Frontage. The Downtown Specific Plan allows a residential building on the Project site to be four stories tall so long as the "fourth floor does not extend for more than 60% of the site frontage along L Street, Railroad Avenue and South Livermore Avenue." (Specific Plan, Ch. 5a, § 4.1.D.5.e.) The Staff Report states that the fourth floors of both Project buildings occupy 33 percent of the project site frontage along L Street, Railroad Avenue, and South Livermore Avenue, and 45 percent of the site
frontage excluding frontage along South Livermore Avenue and the existing Blacksmith Square parcel on Railroad Avenue. But this conclusion misapplies the standard. Because the Project does not front on Livermore Avenue, only the Project site's frontage on Railroad Avenue and L Street is relevant. And the fourth floor
extends more than 60% of the total site frontage on those portions of the site along Railroad Avenue and L Street. Therefore, the Project is inconsistent with this standard in the Specific Plan.
Private Open Space. The Specific Plan requires the Project to provide sixty (60) square feet of private open space per residential unit on-site. (Specific Plan, Ch. 5a, son 6.3.B.) Private open space includes "balconies or patios accessible only to the dwelling/dwellings served." (Id., § 6.3 [emphasis added].) In other words, private open space within a development project cannot be accessed by the general public. The Project does not comply with this requirements. Although the cover sheet to the Project plans states that the Project includes open terraces for the north and south buildings, based on the remainder of the plan set included with the Planning Commission Staff Report, including the renderings of the buildings, there is no 1S

92

indication that these areas are provided only to the Project's residential dwellings. Indeed, the renderings show frontages along the south side of the north building and the north side of the south building that are not separated from the public park in the middle, and are simply integrated into the park seamlessly. This does not qualify as private open space.

Public Open Space. The Specific Plan requires the Project to provide a minimum of one-hundred fifty (150) square feet of publicly available open space per residential unit. (Specific Plan, Ch. 5a, § 6.3.B.) It is unclear from the Project plans and the Staff Report and accompanying materials whether Eden will be funding the creation of the proposed Veteran's Park on the project site. Indeed, from the proposed conditions of approval, it appears that the park improvements would be part of a City project, not Eden's project. (See Condition of Approval 4.D. ['The proposed public park area shown on these entitlement plans are shown for reference only. The Park improvements will be entitled, designed, and constructed separately from this project as part of Citv Proiect 2021-21."] [emphasis added]; see also First Amendment to Disposition, Development, and Loan Agreement ("First Amended DDLA"), section 2.1.ccc. [noting that Veteran's Park "shall be entitled, designed and constructed at the sole discretion of the City, but in coordination with Developer." [emphasis added].) The First Amended DDLA makes clear that the City has the option of negotiating a "future construction and reimbursement agreement" for the construction
of Veteran's Park improvements. (First Amended DDLA, section 3.5.) To that end,
the City has already put out a Request for Proposal for landscape architectural design services for developing Veterans Park, to be paid by the City.' If the City is paying for the public open space, Eden is providing nothing, and is not meeting its is requirements under the Specific Plan.
In sum, the City Council cannot approve Eden's request for Downtown Design Review and make findings that the Project is consistent with the Specific Plan. Approval of the request would violate the law.

II. THE HOUSING ACCOUNTABILITY ACT DOES NOT PREVENT THE CITY
FROM DENYING THE PROJECT

Attached to the Staff Report is a City Attorney memorandum discussing the Density Bonus Law and the HAA. The memo asserts that City Council's ability to deny housing projects is limited due to provisions in the HAA. But evidence in the record is clear that findings can be made under the HAA to deny the Project.

A. Section 65589.5(d) Does Not Prevent the City from Denying the Project
Generally, this section of the HAA disallows cities from denying affordable housing projects unless it makes one or more specific findings. One of those findings is that the project "[w]ould have a specific, adverse impact on the public health or safety, and there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific, adverse impact without" making the project unaffordable to its planned residents. (Gov't Code § 65589.5(d)(2).) A "specific, adverse impact" means "a significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions." (ld. § 65589.5(d)(2).) That finding can be made here.
As noted in our previous May 18, 2021 letter, the San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board ("Regional Board") has raised issues related to contamination at the site,
particularly regarding soil vapor intrusion. Furthermore, on May 7, 2021, PANGEA Environmental Services, Inc. prepared a Data Gap Assessment Workplan for the Project site. It concluded that perchloroethylene (*PCE")*, a noted chemical of concern that is very dangerous to human health and very challenging and expensive to remediate, "has been detected in soil gas and groundwater above Tier 1 screening levels, which merits further characterization and possible mitigation and or/remediation with respect to prospective development at the site." (May 7, 2021 Data Gap Assessment Workplan - Old Train Depot (*Data Gap Workplan"), p. 8, attached hereto as Exhibit B.)* The Data Gap Workplan further concludes that the presence of "arsenic and lead impact in shallow soil merits further characterization,"6 that a "PCE source could be present near the historic railroad lines based on the highest PCE impact in shallow soil gas,' and that "PCE in soil gas represents a potential vapor intrusion concern for future development." (Ihid.) Based on these findings it is clear that there is more contamination than originally suspected in the 2009 EIR, and the mitigation measures suggested for the site, including a workplan, hazardous building materials survey, and Soil Management Plan will not

be enough. Substantial cleanup needs to be done in order to avoid subjecting residents of the Project and visitors of the public park subject to significant health risks, which may make the Project unaffordable.' In addition, because further characterizations are required, it is impossible to know whether mitigation can feasibly avoid the specific adverse health impact of soil vapor intrusion. Therefore, City Council should not approve the Project at this time.
In addition, the HAA states:

[NJothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a local agency from requiring the housing development project to comply with objective, quantifiable, written development standards, conditions, and policies appropriate to, and consistent with, meeting the jurisdiction's share of the regional housing need pursuant to Section 65584. However, the development standards, conditions, and policies shall be applied to facilitate and accommodate development at the density permitted on the site and proposed by the development.
(Gov't Code § 65589.5(f)(1).) In other words, the HAA's savings clause does not preempt or displace the City's ability to regulate the design of the Project through development and design standards. Thus, because the Lucky site allows affordable housing under relevant City planning and zoning documents, the City should be requiring the Project to comply with the applicable standards in the Specific Plan. The City's failure to do so is an abuse of discretion.

B. Section 65589.5(j(1) Does Not Prevent the City from Denying the Project
Generally, this section of the HAA disallows cities from denying housing projects that comply with "applicable, objective general plan, zoning, and subdivision standards and criteria, including design review standards," unless two findings can be made. (Gov't Code § 65589.5(j)(1).) But as noted above, the Project does not comply with objective, applicable standards and criteria. Thus, this issue is not implicated by the Project.
Further, to the extent that the City and/or Eden were to assert that the Project is "deemed" consistent with the applicable rules under Section 65589.5(j)(2), application of this section to the Project would result in violations of constitutional procedural due process rights. Such an argument would essentially deny interested persons the ability to comment on a project that might be inconsistent with applicable objective land use standards before the project was "approved." "Due process principles require reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard before governmental deprivation of a significant property interest." (Horn v. County of Ventura (1979) 24 Cal.3d 605, 612.) California courts have recognized that surrounding landowners whose interests may be adversely affected by a project approval enjoy a constitutional right to notice and an opportunity to be heard. (See Selinger v. City Council (1989) 216 Cal.App.3d 259,

274 [holding former Permit Streamlining Act unconstitutional because it led to approval of to development applications that could lead to substantial deprivation of property of neighboring landowners without providing notice and hearing]; Horn, 24 Cal.3d 605, 617 [plaintiff had a substantial property interest alleging that subdivision plan would substantially interfere with his use of the only access from his parcel to public streets and would increase both traffic congestion and air pollution].) Similarly, such an argument would also violate applicable public hearing notice requirements. (See Gov't Code § 65090.)

III. THE PROJECT IS NOT EXEMPT FROM CEQA ANALYSIS
The Project also does not comply with CEQA, and the City must conduct further environmental analysis before approving the Project.

A. The Project Is Not Statutorily Exempt
The Staff Report first concludes that the Project is exempt from CEQA review under Government Code Section 65457 and CEQA Guidelines Section 15182 (c). (Staff Report, p. 19; p. id., Attachment 4 [draft CEQA Resolution], pp. 1-2.) As discussed in our May 18, 2021 letter to City Council, this is incorrect. A residential project implementing a Specific Plan is only exempt from CEQA review if (1) an agency has prepared an EIR on a Specific Plan after January 1, 1980, (2) the residential project conforms to the Specific Plan, and (3) no events under Public Resources Code Section 21166 have occurred since the adoption of the Specific Plan. (Gov't Code § 65457(a).)
Here, and as explained in our May 18, 2021 letter, the Project does not conform to the Specific Plan with regards to parking, site frontage, setbacks, overall building massing, main entrance/siting and orientation, windows, horizontal mass, or private open space requirements. Because the project does not comply with the required standards in the Specific Plan, the CEQA exemption cannot be used.ª (Gov't Code § 65457(a) [project must be "consistent with a specific plan for which an environmental impact report has been certified"] [emphasis added]; see also CEQA Guidelines § 15182(c)(1) ["[A] residential project undertaken pursuant to and in conformity to that specific plan is exempt from CEQA if the project meets the requirements of this section."] [emphasis added].)
Additionally, recent activity and concerns raised by the Regional Board require that the City engage in supplemental or subsequent environmental review before approving the Project under Public Resources Code Section 21166. Although the Staff Report's draft CEQA Resolution asserts that the Project will comply with the 2009 EIR mitigation measures, these mitigation measures do not address recent concerns of the Regional Board. (See May 18, 2021

Even if the HAA arguably precludes a city from denying an affordable housing project except in certain circumstances and precludes the use of design review standards in such a denial, the HAA does not change CEQA, and it docs not eliminate a city's duty to comply with CEQA requirements. (Gov't Code § 65589.5(e).)

Letter, pp. 7-9.) Thus, the Project is not exempt from further environmental review under Government Code Section 65457.

B. The Project Is Not Categorically Exempt
The Staff Report also asserts that the Project is separately and independently exempt from CEQA review under CEQA Guidelines Sections 15332 (infill projects), 15304 (a) and (b) (minor alterations to land), and 15308 (actions taken by regulatory agencies to ensure the maintenance, restoration, enhancement, or protection of the environment). (Staff Report, p. 19.)
As an initial matter, the Project does not meet the requirements for any of the three exemptions. First, the CEQA Guidelines Section 15332 exemption for in-fill development projects requires a project to be "consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15332(a).) co. As discussed above and in our May 18, 2021 letter, the Project does not conform to the City's applicable development standards set forth in the Downtown Specific Plan, which serve as the zoning regulations for the property.
Second, Staff argues that the Project is exempt under CEQA Guidelines Section 15304 as a minor alteration to land. (See Staff Report Attachment 4 [draft CEQA Resolution], p. 5.) Specifically, Staff asserts the Project is exempt because it proposes minor grading on the parcel and new landscaping activities. This is : misapplication of the law. That the Project involves landscaping and minor grading does not qualify the Project in its entirety to be exempt as a minor alteration. Under Staff's logic, the City of Livermore could build any project under the "minor alteration to land" exemption so long as it involved landscaping activities.
Third, Staff relies on CEQA Guidelines Section 15308, asserting that the Project is
exempt as an action taken by a regulatory agency for the protection of the environment. (See Staff Report Attachment 4 [draft CEQA Resolution], p. 5.) Staff reasons that the park dedication on Parcel Two contributes to the enhancement of the environment and therefore qualifies the Project for this exemption. (Ibid.) However, "[c]onstruction activities and relaxation of standards allowing environmental degradation are not included in this exemption." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15308.) As discussed above and in our May 18, 2021 Letter, construction of the Project would exacerbate the current contamination issues and result in a significant impact on the environment and public health. The Project therefore does not qualify for this exemption.
Even if the Project did fall under these exemptions, the presence of unusual circumstances prevents the use of any of the three categorical exemptions relied upon in the Staff Report. (Great Oaks Water Co. V. Santa Clara Valley Water Dist. (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 956, 967 fn. 8 ["Categorical exemptions . are subject to exceptions that defeat the use of the exemption"] [citation omitted].) As stated in CEQA Guidelines 15300.2(c), "[e]ven if an activity fits within an otherwise exempt category, the agency may not find it exempt if the project will a have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." The "unusual circumstances" exception to a categorical exemption involves two inquiries: (1) whether the project presents unusual circumstances; and (2) whether there is a reasonable possibility that a significant environmental impact will result due to those circumstances. (Commitlee to Save the

Hollywoodland Specific Plan v. City of Los Angeles V. (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1186 [citation and footnote omitted, emphasis added].) Further, if the agency finds the project will have a significant impact, that finding necessarily establishes that some circumstance of the project is unusual, and the exception applies. (Berkeley Hillside Preservation v City of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1086, 1105.)
The presence of contamination on the Project site, particularly the presence of soil vapor intrusion as noted by the Regional Board, will have a significant impact on the environment, and therefore constitutes an unusual circumstance. (See May 18, 2021 Letter, pp. 7-9; April 18, 2020 Site Assessment and Summary Report - Old Train Depot, dated Apr. 18, 2020 [stating that the site has several chemicals of concern in the soil and groundwater, including arsenic, lead, petroleum hydrocarbons, and volatile organic compounds].) At the very least, the Regional Board's concerns constitute evidence demonstrating a reasonable possibility that a significant impact will result from this Project. That the risk of soil vapor intrusion releasing into the residential structure constitutes an "unusual" circumstance for a housing project is without question. Most in-fill development projects within city limits or projects constituting minor alterations to land do not include the risk of soil vapor intrusion harming the residents of the project. In addition, projects falling under the exemption for regulatory actions protecting the environment would not include the potential significant impact of hazardous chemicals seeping into groundwater and soil. Thus, the presence of unusual circumstances defeats any categorical exemption relied upon in the Staff Report.
