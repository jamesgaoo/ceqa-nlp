23 1. Petitioner ROOPA SHEKAR is a citizen and taxpayer of the State of California who

24 resides at 18290 Daves, Avenue, City of Monte Sereno, County of Santa Clara.

25 3. Petitioner brings this action on her own behalf. Petitioner would suffer adverse

26 impacts from the respondents' actions in approving this development commonly known as the

27 18240 Daves Avenue Project for the construction of an approximate 489 square foot addition to
the first floor of an approximate 1506.5 square

28 foot addition to the second floor of an existing
two story 3,760 square foot historic adobe home (hereinafter "18240 Daves Avenue Project").

2 Such adverse impacts would include those set forth in Swift Consulting Services Report dated

3 February 16, 2021 attached hereto as Exhibit "1" and incorporated herein by this reference as if

4 set forth fully verbatim.

5 4. The a City of Monte Sereno is a government agency of the State of California.

6 5. The city council is the governing body of the City of Monte Sereno and is authorized

7 and required by law to hold public hearings and to determine the adequacy of and certify

8 environmental documents under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), as well as
compliance with the municipal codes of the City of Monte Sereno, and to take other actions with

10 respect to the approval of the development within its jurisdiction.

11 6. Real Party in Interest PETER G. GOLL is the owner of 18240 Daves Avenue, Monte

12 Sereno and is the project applicant for 18240 Daves Avenue Project.

13 7. The true names and capacities of DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, are unknown to

14 petitioners. Petitioners will amend this complaint to set forth the true names and capacities of

15 said DOE real parties in interest as soon as the same have been ascertained. Plaintiffs are

16 informed and believe and thereon allege that each of said DOE parties through 10 has

17 jurisdiction by law over one or more aspects of the Project and its approval, and that each of said

18 DOE parties 1 through 10 claims an ownership interest in the property which is the subject of

19 this action, or an interest in its development or the actions of the respondents challenged herein.

20 8. The 18240 Daves Avenue Project would increase footprint to the first story of the

21 historic adobe home by 20% and deplete the privacy, view, and natural light of neighboring

22 properties, including that of Petitioner with a 217% square foot increase of the second story of

23 the historic adobe home by illegally disregarding setback requirements, allowing the new

24 footprint of the structure to be within the drip line of a significant tree used for soil stability at

25 the edge of the slope, which increases the risk of property damage, diminution of value of

26 neighboring properties and threats to life due to geological and seismic events.

27 9. The project will have the detrimental impacts on the Petitioner and the environment as

28 set forth in the Swift Consulting Services Report dated February 16, 2021 attached hereto as
Exhibit "1" and incorporated herein by this reference as if set forth fully verbatim.

2

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

10. Approval of the Project is inconsistent with the City of Monte Sereno's general plan
2 to minimize the disturbance or removal of existing trees to the extent possible, impose set back
requirements to prevent property damage and loss of life or injury due to geologic hazards and
4 seismic hazards, as well as well as to meet the State of California requirements to preserve
Historic Resources.
6 11. The City of Monte Sereno illegally declared that the 18240 Daves Avenue Project
7 permits were categorically exempt under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA")
8 section 15301(a) and therefore erroneously concluded that no usual circumstances regarding the
9
18240 Dave Avenue Project had the potential to have a significant effect on the environment and
10 did not commission an Environmental Impact Report before issuing its Notice of Determination.
11 12. On or about January 19, 2021, the City of Monte Sereno caused a Notice of
12 Determination regarding the approval of the 18240 Daves Avenue Project to be filed based on
13 erroneous, inaccurate and incomplete data set forth in the January 19, 2021 Staff Report, a true
14 and correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit "2" and incorporated herein by this
15 reference as if set forth fully verbatim.

17 Determination as required by Public Resources Code Section 21167(d).
18 14. On February 18, 2021, before the commencement of this action, petitioners served
19 written notice of the commencement of this action on respondents in accordance with the
20 requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5.
21 15. On February 18, 2021, petitioners notified the Attorney General of the State of
22 California of the filing of this complaint and petition and furnished him/her with a copy of the a
23 complaint and petition in accordance with the requirements of Public Resources Code Section
24 21167.7.
25 16. The action of the respondents in approving the Project, including issuance of Special
26 Use and Site Development permits and a variance, and purporting to comply with CEQA 27 constitute prejudicial abuse of discretion because the respondents failed to proceed in a manner
28 required by law and made findings which are not supported by substantial evidence, in each of

3

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

the respects enumerated below.
2 17. Petitioners have exhausted all administrative remedies in that these determinations by
3 the respondent are final and no further administrative appeal procedures are provided by state or
4 local law. Petitioner presented orally and/or in writing their specific objections to the decisions
of the City of Monte Sereno at the public meetings and hearings, including but not limited to the
matters set forth in Exhibit "1" of this Petition herein.
7 18. Petitioner does not a have a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course
of law because the petitioner and the public will be irreparably harmed by the ensuing
environmental damage and by the respondents' violations of CEQA and, city and state planning
10 and zoning laws.
11 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
12 California Environmental Quality Act
13 19. Petitioner incorporates by this reference paragraphs 1 through 19 as though they were
14 set forth in full herein.

Roopa Shekar
18290 Daves Ave.
Monte Sereno, CA 95030

Following is an evaluation of the City of Monte Sereno approval of Variance(V-20-01), Special Use(SU-20-1) and Site Development (SS-20-05) for a proposed addition to the existing house at
18240 Daves Avenue in Monte Sereno.

Development standards
The staff report, dated Jan 19, 2021 appears to correctly apply the Slope density formula to the subject property and correctly concludes that the property is subject to the development standards of the R-1-20 zone district. The City zoning Code Section 10.05.020 - "R-1-44"
Residential District states:

"Each parcel of property or lot, as the case may be, having either more or less lot area than the minimum required in this residential zoning district shall comply with all of the regulations of the residential zoning district whose minimum lot area requirement is closest to the actual lot
area of the particular parcel of property or lot."

Although the staff report appears to correctly conclude that effective development standards for this site are those of the R-1-20 zone district, the application of these standards to the
subject property has been in error.

Side setback
The staff report states "Per Section 10.05.030(C)(3) the side interior setbacks for the first and
second floors are 15-and 20-feet respectfully." However Section 10.05.030 (4.1) states :
"Each of the minimum front, side and rear setbacks shall be increased by five (5) feet for each ten thousand (10,000) square feet by which the area of a parcel of property or lot exceeds the minimum lot area required in this residential zoning district, or per the slope density formula as set forth in the Subdivision Title of this Code should the lot qualify."
The slope density formula as calculated by the City Planner results in a minimum lot area based on the slope density formula of 32,317.169 sq.ft. The area of the subject property is 44,005 ft which is 11,487.831 sq ft in excess of the minimum lot size per the slope density formula. The side setbacks should therefore be increased by 5' to 20 for the first floor and 25' for the second floor. Instead of an encroachment of 4' at the closest point as stated on pg 3 of the staff report the encroachment would be 9' into the required setback to the first floor. The second floor
would encroach 10' 2" into the required setback as opposed to the 5'2" stated in the staff report. This is a substantial difference in the extent to which the proposed addition intrudes

Exhibit "1"

into the side setback. The Site and Architectural Commission and City Council based their decision on an inaccurate interpretation of zoning ordinance as it relates to the required side setbacks. This interpretation served to minimize the extent of the variance and the associated
reduction of privacy and open space on the adjacent property known as 18290 Daves Ave.

Height
The staff report on Pages 4 and 5 alleges that the vertical and horizontal separation between the two structures along with other factors serve to minimize any visual and privacy impact to the adjacent neighboring property. Unfortunately the reduced side yard setbacks of the
a proposed structure with a height of 30 feet when added to the elevation difference between
the two properties of approximately 30' will result in a home that will loom significantly over the adjacent property at 18290 Daves Ave. and have a significant visual impact as well as significantly reduce the sense of privacy and open space as perceived from this property.

Section 10.05.030(S) states that the maximum building height in the R-1-20 Residential District
(the applicable district based on the slope density formula) is 14'for the first floor and 21' for
the second floor. The maximum height can be increased by an additional one(1) foot for each foot that portion of the structure is further distanced from the minimum setback, provided that
maximum height does not exceed 21' for the first floor and 30' for the second floor.

Neither the Jan. 19, 2021 staff report to the City Council or the Oct. 7 2020 staff report to the Site and Architectural Commission discuss the fact that the proposed 30 height of the second story addition would require an additional side setback of 9'. When this 9' additional setback is
"; added to the 25' required side setback as discussed above, the total required side setback is 34'
% to the second story.

The extent of the requested variance from the required side yard setbacks relative to the
proposed height of the structure was significantly underrepresented in the staff reports to both the Site and Architectural Commission and City Council.

Furthermore the City staff and decision making bodies did not fully or accurately assess the impacts of the proposed addition and associated significant reductions in setbacks due to the height which exceeds the standard as set forth in the zoning ordinance in relationship to the
following General Plan Policies;

Policy LU-1.2 Require new development to complement and enhance existing neighborhood
character.
Policy LU-1.3 : Continue to review new development proposals to ensure that they do not
overwhelm their sites or their neighborhood.

It is clear that this 30' tall, 2 story proposed addition along the common property line with the property at 18290 Daves Ave, where the reduction in the actual required setback of 34' was approved to be reduced to 14'8" at its closest point will not complement and enhance the existing neighborhood character and will in fact overwhelm this neighboring property.

Special Circumstance required for approval of the Variance.
In order to argue that a property has a Special Circumstance sufficient to justify approval of a requested Variance it must be confirmed that alternatives that would not require a Variance
have been exhaustively explored and the denial of the requested reduction in standards will
deprive the property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the area. In this case the staff
report to the Site and Architectural Commission and City Council provide no clear analysis why
alternatives such as adding a master bedroom over the proposed garage is not feasible. It is
also not clear why the granting of the requested Variance to allow an expansion of this existing
home, with over 3,182 sq ft and currently containing a kitchen and upstairs bedrooms that
themselves could feasibly be converted to a master bedroom and which will have such
deleterious consequences for the property at 18290 Daves Ave. is a not a grant of special
privilege.

Tree/Arborist issues
There is no indication in the project staff report that an arborist report as required by Section
10.15.060 has been completed to evaluate the impacts of the proposed addition on the large
tree located immediately adjacent to the proposed addition. The orange netting erected by
the applicant outlining the addition appears to encroach significantly into the drip line of this
tree and in conflict with a large portion of the tree foliage. The grading for the foundation
appears to be very close to the tree and will most likely effect the root structure. This tree is
located on the very edge of the steep slope. IF the stability of the tree is weakened this could
also have impacts on the stability of the soil on this steep slope.

Several General Plan policies clearly speak to the importance of trees and that development
proposals should minimize disturbance or removal of existing trees to the extent possible.
General Plan Policy OSC 5.5 requires the continued enforcement of the Tree Removal
Ordinance and that development proposals provide adequate information to City staff to assess
the project's impact on this existing tree.

Policy OSC-5.1: Continue to require that development proposals minimize the disturbance to or
removal of existing trees to the extent possible.
Policy OSC-5.2: Require that removed trees be replaced with at lease a one-to one ratio, unless
prohibited by good forestry practices Policy OSC-5.3: Encourage the replacement of non-native trees with California native tree
species.
Policy OSC-5.5: Continue to enforce the Tree Removal Ordinance and require development
proposals to provide adequate information to City staff to assess the project's impact on existing
trees.

The following sections of the Zoning Ordinance clearly require that the potential impacts of a
development proposal on nearby trees be evaluated by an arborist.

10.15.010 - Purpose. Tree Removal Ordinance
It is the intent of this Chapter to establish regulations for the removal of significant trees
within the City in order to retain as many trees as possible consistent with the purpose hereof

3

500 Chestnut Street, Suite 100 Santa Cruz, CA 95060 (831) 459-9992 Fax (831) 459-9998

and the reasonable enjoyment of private property. These regulations are adopted for the
purpose of ensuring the preservation of natural scenic beauty throughout the City necessary to
the public health and welfare of its citizens in the maintenance of a stable environment and in
the prevention of soil erosion, flooding, landslides, air pollution, climactic changes and public
and private expense for corrective measures resulting there from, and to also provide for better control of noise through protection for mature trees.

10.15.015 - Definitions.
"Significant tree" means: (1) oaks or redwood trees having a circumference greater than twenty (20) inches measured at a height of forty-eight (48) inches above natural grade; or (2)
any tree having a circumference greater than twenty-five (25) inches measured at a height of
forty-eight (48) inches above natural grade.
"Remove" means eliminate, take away, uproot or destroy or top. For purposes of this Chapter,
"remove" also means taking any action that reasonably and foreseeably will lead to the death of a tree or to permanent significant damage to the health or structural integrity of a tree. Such actions can include, without limitation and by way of example, excessive pruning, cutting,
girding, poisoning, or watering of a tree; the unauthorized relocation or transportation of a
tree; excessive excavation, alteration, or grading of the soil within the dripline of a tree,...

10.15.040 - Significant tree; removal; permit required.
Except as provided in Section it 10.15.020, it shall be unlawful for any person to remove, or cause to be removed, any significant tree, dead tree or unsuitable tree from any parcel of property in the City without first applying for and obtaining a permit for the removal from the
City Manager or City Planner for dead or undesirable trees, or the City's Site and Architecture
Commission or City Council for all other significant trees.
10.15.060 - Permit; arborist; evaluation.
B3 In the event an applicant desires to remove a significant tree due to disease, danger of falling
or threat to owner or surrounding residents or to remove a dead tree, the City may require, at
the cost of the applicant for the permit, an inspection and evaluation of any tree or trees
proposed to be removed by an arborist who has been prequalified by the City. The arborist
shall inspect and evaluate the tree or trees. The arborist shall also prepare a written report detailing the condition of the tree, and any remedial measure that could be taken to minimize
the disease or threat to the owner or surrounding residents. The arborist's report shall be considered when evaluating the request for a permit. Unsuitable to provide proof of species. In the event an applicant desires to remove an unsuitable tree, the City may require, at the cost of the applicant for the permit, verification of the species of the tree.

Slope Stability issues
The proposed project includes the construction of the addition and excavation of a basement in
close a proximity to a descending steep slope. This should have been evaluated prior to a
decision to approve a Variance to decrease the setback to the property line that also results in a decrease in setback to the steep slope.

The State Building Code establishes a setbacks from descending slopes. This setback can be if reduced if information from a geotechnical engineer confirms the slope will remain stable post development. The required setback or any discussion relative to its reduction is not included in
the staff reports to the City Council or Site and Architectural Commission . The General Plan

4

500 Chestnut Street, Suite 100 Santa Cruz, CA 95060 (831) 459-9992 Fax (831) 459-9998
www.swiftconsultingservice.com

includes several Policies, listed below, that are intended to prevent property damage and loss
of life or injury due to geologic and seismic hazards. However the staff report does not provide any evidence that the geologic hazards or stability of the slope adjacent to the proposed addition have been evaluated or considered in the decision by the City to approve the
requested Variances or Site Development permits.

General Plan Goal HS-2: Prevent loss of life, injury, and property damage due to geologic and
seismic hazards.
GP Policy HS-2.1: Evaluate seismic risks and require earthquake protection measures as part of
the Development Review process.
GP Policy HS-2.2: requires that a geologic hazard investigation for all projects in hillside areas be performed by the development project applicant as part of the Development Review process.
GP Policy HS-3.2 : requires the preparation of a soils report prior to the approval of significant
additions to existing structures. Policy HS-3.3: Require that new development is constructed in such a manner as to protect life
and property from soil erosion and slope failure

Historical issues
The existing house has been designated as historical resource. The staff report states that:
"The proposed addition is consistent with the Secretary of Interior Standards for the Treatment
of Historic Structures for rehabilitation thus minimizing any significant environmental impact to
the adobe construction. However the ten Secretary of the Interior standards are not identified
nor is there any substantive evaluation of the proposed addition in relation to these standards.

For example, the Secretary of the Interior Standard No. 9 states:

"New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction will not destroy historic
materials, features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work
shall be differentiated from the old and will be compatible with the historic materials, features,
size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its
environment."

The proposed addition will substantially exceed the height, scale, proportion and massing of the
historic adobe. A report by a professional Historic Resources consultant should have been
conducted prior to approval of a Site Development permit in order to ascertain the impacts of
the proposed addition to the historical resource and its consistency with the Secretary of the
Interior Standards.

CEQA(California Environmental Quality Act issues)
The staff report to the City Council indicates that the project is Categorically Exempt under
CEQA Guidelines section 15301(e), Existing Facilities. The staff report also concludes that none
of the exceptions to this exemption apply in this case. However, CEQA states the following:

c) Significant Effect. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a
reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to
unusual circumstances.

500 Chestnut Street, Suite 100 Santa Cruz, CA 95060 (831) 459-9992 Fax (831) 459-9998
www.swiftconsultingservice.com

As discussed above there is a reasonable possibility that the proposed addition will have a
significant effect on a significant a tree adjacent to the project, a significant effect on the stability
of the steep slopes that are adjacent to the project and a significant effect on the historical
resource. The staff report does not include sufficient information to determine that there will
not be significant effect on these environmental resources. It is an unusual circumstance that
this project includes a significant addition to a historical resource that is also is located adjacent
a to a steep slope and a significant tree. a

Given the reasonable possibility that this addition will have a significant effect on the
environment and the lack of information that could possibly demonstrate otherwise, a
Categorical Exemption is not appropriate for this project. A Negative Declaration or Mitigated Negative Declaration would be appropriate for this project.

Please let me know if you have additional questions regarding this evaluation.

Sincerely,
JLiedourkt

PUBLIC HEARING
JANUARY 19, 2021
JEANNIE HAMILTON, AICP, CITY PLANNER
SECRETARY TO THE SITE AND ARCHITECTURAL COMMISSION

Special Use, Site Development, and
Variance Request
Request for a Special Use Permit (SU-20-01), Site Development Permit (SS-20-05), and a Variance (V-20-01) for the construction of an approximate 611 square foot addition to the first floor and an approximate 919 square foot addition to the second floor of an existing two-story 3,423 square foot historic adobe home at 18240
Dave Avenue.

RECOMMENDATION

The Site and Architectural Commission recommends that the City Council approve the requested Special Use Permit, Site Development Permit, and Variance in that the status
of the home as historic and its existing construction type and placement necessitate the location of any additions to the rear of the existing home to preserve the historic integrity of the adobe structure. The proposed development is consistent with the Secretary of
the Interior's Standards for Treatment of Historic Properties and the City's design
guidelines and has been designed to minimize any impacts from the new construction on surrounding propertles.

BACKGROUND

At the October 7. 2020 Site and Architectural Commission meeting the Commission held a public hearing on the proposed project. The meeting was held via Zoom due to COVID-19 Public Health Orders. All Commissioners were present as was Jeannie

SPECIAL USE AND SITE DEVELOPMENT PERMIT & CITY COUNCIL
VARIANCE REQUEST FOR 18240 DAVES AVENUE JANUARY 19, 2021
PAGE 2 OF 3

Hamilton, City Planner and Sergio Rudin, City Attorney. The proposed project was the subject of a previous application which came before the City Council in February of 2020. At that time the City Council denied the project with direction to the applicant to address the following design concerns including vertical mass, visual and privacy impact, lack of stepped elements, and encroachment into the setback. As was discussed in the staff report to Site & Architectural Commission, the property owner has met with the adjacent property owner on a few occasions to address the above issue. As a result, the applicant has modified the proposal to address various design concerns. A full discussion of the project is included in the attached report to the Site and Architectural Commission.

PUBLIC HEARING AND COMMISSION DISCUSSION
Staff presented an overview of the proposed project and discussed the various application requests and the required findings for each request. Staff also highlighted the modifications the applicant has made with the new proposal to address a number of the concerns expressed during the discussion of the previous application.
The applicant and his architect presented an overview of their proposal highlighting the changes that were made from the previous proposal including a significant reduction in the requested variance, reducing the overall height of the addition by foot, pulling the outdoor deck area to behind the required setback and including a privacy wall, and eliminating a second floor balcony.

The Commission then opened the public hearing. There were several members of the public who spoke on the project. The property owners of 18290 Daves Avenue, adjacent and downslope of the subject site, spoke in opposition. They do not support the proposal and still feel that the size and location will have an impact on their privacy and the livability of their property. There were other residents of Monte Sereno who spoke in opposition to the project citing the need for the property owner to abide by the rules, in reference to the City's zoning standards, just like every other property owner must.

There were also members of the public who spoke in support of the proposal. The property owners who live along the shared driveway with the subject property all spoke in support of the project. They indicated that they see this home as they drive to their own homes and appreciate the work that the property owner has done to upgrade the property and support his proposal to further enhance the living area. These property owners indicated that they did not feel there would be a visual impact on their immediate neighborhood from the new addition.
After the public comment, the applicant and his architect presented final comments. Craig Mineweaser, the architect for the project, noted that the Secretary of the Interior's

Standards for Treatment of Historic Properties specifically allow for additions to historic structures, so that such structures can enjoy continued use. He emphasized the importance of placing any addition at the southern end of the property to preserve the view of the historic adobe. The practical reason for the addition is to expand the kitchen area to bring the home up to current living standards and thus aiding in the preservation of the structure. It was noted that alternative configurations would be difficult to achieve while preserving the existing adobe structure, as interior walls on the first floor are also adobe. The Commission then closed the public hearing and discussed the project.
The Commission acknowledged the changes that had been made since the first proposal. They also acknowledged the special circumstances of the historic structure and the fixed location of it presenting some constraints to expansion. The commission also acknowledged the work that the applicant has already done with the structure to rehabilitate and preserve its historic integrity. There was a recognition that the requested variance had been minimized if and that even if the proposed additions were pulled behind the required setback the issue of perceived privacy would remain. The Commission acted on each request separately. The Commission voted 5-0 to recommend the City Council approve the variance. They also voted 5-0 to approve the special use permit. Upon discussion of the site development permit, the Commission discussed the possibility of including an additional condition of approval to further address the privacy concerns. The Commission voted 5-0 to approve the site development permit with a condition to plant two (2) 48" native species box trees to improve privacy screening at the corner of the addition.

CEQA

Per the California Environmental Quality Act, the subject permits are Categorically Exempt under CEQA Guidelines section 15301(e),Existing Facilities of the Guidelines in that the proposal does not exceed 10,000 square feet and the area is served by public services to allow for maximum development permissible in the General Plan (one single-family home). Additionally, the proposed construction is within the existing developed site and not on any environmentally sensitive lands. Alternatively, the project is exempt pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15303, which allows
construction of a single-family residence in a residential zone, including modifications thereto. The exceptions to the categorical exemptions in CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2 do not apply to this project. The proposed addition to the historic adobe home is consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Treatment of Historic Properties for rehabilitation as the addition is adjacent to the historic construction and the materials used are consistent with a previous addition, and
therefore the project is unlikely to cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource. Additionally, the project is not located in a particularly sensitive environment, does not involve a hazardous waste site or a scenic highway, and is unlikely to create cumulative impact as there are no presently anticipated subsequent projects. Lastly, when compared to other addition projects within the City, staff have been unable to identify anything about this

Special Use, Site Development, and
Variance Request
Request for a Special Use Permit (SP-20-01), Site Development Permit (SS-20-05), and a Variance (V-20-01) for the construction of an approximate 611 square foot addition to the first floor and an approximate 919 square foot addition to the second floor of an existing two-story 3,423 square foot historic adobe home.

RECOMMENDATION

Staff recommends that the Site and Architectural Commission recommend that the City Council approve the requested Special Use Permit, Site Development Permit, and Variance in that the status of the home as historic and its existing construction type and placement necessitate the location of any additions to the rear of the existing home to preserve the historic integrity of the adobe structure. The proposed development is consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Treatment of Historic Properties and the City's design guidelines and has been designed to minimize any impacts from the new construction on surrounding properties.

BACKGROUND

On July 27, 2020, the property owner of 18240 Daves Avenue submitted an application for a Special Use Permit, Site Development Permit, and a Variance. A similar project had been submitted in 2019 and was considered by both the Site and Architectural Commission and City Council and was acted on by the City Council at their February 4, 2020 meeting. The Site and Architectural Commission had recommended approval of the project for the first-floor addition and variance, however, at that time the

Commission did not support a variance at the second floor as designed. The City Council denied the project with direction to address the following design concerns: vertical mass, visual and privacy impacts, lack of stepped elements, and encroachment in the setback. The property owner has met with the adjacent property owner on a few occasions to address the above issues, including a meeting at City Hall with the adjacent property owner, City Manager Steve Leonardis and City Planner Jeannie Hamilton. As a result of these meetings the applicant has modified the proposal to address various design concerns which will be discussed throughout this report.
This application includes a Special Use Permit, Site Development Permit, and a Variance. Because the Special Use Permit and Variance applications are within the authority of the City Council to approve, the related Site Development Permit must also be acted on by the City Council. Pursuant to Monte Sereno Municipal Code sections 10.08.055, 10.10.010 and 10.10.020, the Site and Architectural Commission is to provide its recommendation to the City Council on the site development permit, use permit and proposed variance.

The subject property is located on the
corner of Daves Avenue when it then turns
south and is zoned R-1-44. The site is Daves Av

accessed off a private driveway from Daves Avenue serving four homes. The
subject site is approximately 1.01 gross acres (44,005 sq. ft.) and has an average slope of 23.9 % and slopes to the west
down to Daves Avenue from the private
driveway.

With an average slope 10% or greater, the slope density formula is utilized to
determine the effective zoning regulations
and any adjustments to the development
standards. As a result, the effective
development standards for this site are
those of the R-1-20 zoning district. Per the same formula, maximum dwelling size allowed is 5,074 square feet and the allowable structural coverage is reduced to 20% down from 30% and the allowable
impervious coverage is reduced to 36%
from 40%. Aerial of existing home at 18240 Daves Avenue.

The existing home on the lot is an adobe home built in 1938 while in the unincorporated lands of Santa Clara County. In approximately 1963, a second story addition was approved to the south end of the home. The home was included on the City's Historic Inventory in December of 2017. The City Council also entered into a Mills Act Contract

for Historic Properties with the property owner at the same time as approving the
historic designation.

ANALYSIS

Submitted Design

The applicant is proposing to construct a 1,308 square foot two-story addition to the existing 3,182 square foot home. The addition is proposed at the south side of the structure keeping the first floor of the adobe structure intact and placing the addition adjacent to a portion of the south wall of the home. The second-floor addition is above the first-floor addition and designed as an extension of the previously approved second- story addition. The overall design is similar to the design considered in 2019 however the proposed encroachments into the required side setback are much reduced. Since the existing structure is eligible for inclusion on both the California and the National Register for Historic Places, any alterations to the structure have been analyzed relative to consistency with the California Secretary of Interior's Standards for the Treatment of
Historic Structures.

In comparison to the project considered in 2019, this submitted design significantly reduces any encroachment into the side setback. Per Section 10.05.030 (C)(3) the side interior setbacks for the first and second floor are 15- and 20-feet respectively. At the first floor the proposed addition encroaches 4 feet at its closest point, reduced by approximately 4.75 feet from the previous proposal. The western most point of the proposed first floor addition encroaches only 19 inches into the required 15-foot setback for a total of 100 square feet into the side setback area. At the second floor, the proposed addition encroaches 5 feet 2 inches reduced by approximately 8 feet 6 inches from the previous proposal. The westernmost point of the second-floor addition encroaches approximately 2 feet 10 inches into the required 20-foot setback for a total of 128 square feet into the side setback area.

The first-floor outdoor deck area has been included wholly within the required setback and the previously proposed Juliet balcony at the second floor has been eliminated altogether. This redesign addresses two of the issues identified by the City Council including encroachment into the setback and visual impact. The applicant has worked to minimize the requested encroachment into the setback thus pulling the addition further away from the downslope neighbor to the south. The proposed additions at this location keep any new living area located at the top of the site so that it remains further away from the downslope neighbor as opposed to a design that steps down the hill which would bring new living area closer to the downslope neighbor's yard and pool areas.

The property owner has already removed previous additions to the home that were constructed into the setback, including (1) a patio and treilis at the first-floor that was
127 square feet approximately 2.5 feet from the side property line; and (2) a rooftop balcony at the second floor approximately 141 total square feet of which approximately 40 square feet encroached into the setback.

Request for a Variance

As stated above, the existing home was built in 1938 in the Spanish Colonial Revival design constructed with adobe bricks. In 1963, a second story addition was constructed
over an existing wing of the home. The existing wing enjoyed legal nonconforming status relative to the setback along the driveway. The proposed second story addition was granted a variance to the front setback from 30 feet down to 11 feet along the front property line consistent with the existing home's footprint. The proposed addition met the required 20' side setback at that time.

The currently submitted proposal
includes a two-story addition to the home adjacent to the existing two- story portion of the home extending it
westward to the rear essentially filling
in that floor area of the home. The
addition serves to create a larger kitchen and dining area at the first
floor as well as integrating a master bedroom into the home at the second
floor. The location of the addition Existing home showing 2nd story addition
works to preserve the integrity of the
existing adobe construction by retaining the existing adobe walls and extending out from them. As shown on the plans, the existing home is set at the top of the lot which is flat in the southeastern corner. The topography and steepness of the lot at the western edge of the home down to Daves Avenue coupled with the location of the existing home and the adobe construction of the
home otherwise limit the opportunities for expansion to a constrained area at the top of
the lot.

The average slope of the lot is 23.9% which when coupled with the size of the lot reduces the allowable home size down from 6,000 square feet to 5,074 square feet. This is due to the requirement to utilize the slope density formula for any property with an average slope of 10% or greater. Although there are other lots in the area subject to
the same slope density formula, those lots are not encumbered with the location of a
historic home and appear to have greater opportunity to expand their homes through
the use of grading or flatter areas of the lots.

As discussed above, the topography of the lot and the steepness down to Daves Avenue, as well as the existing location of the historic structure are special circumstances that constrain opportunities for expansion of the home without impacting the integrity of the adobe construction. By proposing the second story addition over the proposed first floor addition, the need to modify the adobe structure to carry any additional load is minimized thus preserving the structural integrity of the adobe, which is the essence of the historic structure, to the greatest extent feasible. The proposed additions do not exceed the maximum allowed dwelling square footage.

Staff recommends that the Site & Architectural Commission recommend that the City Council approve the varlance due to special circumstances related to topography of the site and location of an existing historic structure which both circumstances limit
opportunities to expand the living area enjoyed by other properties located in the same zoning district within the same general area discussed above. In accordance with Government Code section 65906 and Section 10.10.020 of the City of Monte Sereno Municipal Code, a variance ".. shall be granted only when, because of special circumstances applicable to the property, including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, the strict application of the zoning ordinance deprives the property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the vicinity and under an identical zoning classification."

Request for a Special Use Permit
As set forth in 12.01.080 of the City of Monte Sereno Municipal Code, a Special Use Permit is required for any alteration to a structure listed on the City's Historic Inventory. As mentioned above, the adobe home at 18240 Daves Avenue was included on the City's inventory in December of 2017. The property owner also entered into a Mills Act Contract with the City voluntarily and has a program to preserve, rehabilitate, and maintain the existing historic resource.
Per Section 12.01.110 of the City of Monte Sereno Municipal Code, the City Council shall consider the following regarding the issuance of a Special Use Permit for alteration of an historic structure, with staff interpretation of the requirements in italics.
1. The proposed work s consistent with the purposes and objectives of this Chapter
(historic preservation);
The property owner has taken many steps in the preservation of the existing structure including having it added to the City's Historic Inventory; entering into a Mill's Act Contract; and making other repairs and improvements to the existing structure. The proposed addition expands the living area to create a master bedroom and a larger eat in kitchen and dining area for the existing home which serves to create a more livable home into the future.
2. The proposed work does not adversely affect the character or integrity of the designated feature;
The proposed addition is not over the existing structure and serves to preserve the adobe construction by placing the new addition to the south side of the existing home and integrates it with the previous addition. Structural alteration to the adobe construction is minimized and the lower scale look of the existing
single-story portion of the home is retained and is the dominant view from the
driveway.

3. The proposed work will not result in a significant environmental impact that
cannot be mitigated; or

The proposed addition is consistent with the Secretary of Interior Standards for
the Treatment of Historic Structures for rehabilitation thus minimizing any significant environmental impact to the adobe construction.

4. In the case of construction of a new building, structure or other improvement upon or within a designated feature, the exterior of such improvement will not adversely affect and will be compatible with the external appearance of the
existing feather.

The proposed addition has been designed consistent with the previous addition thus separating it from the original adobe construction yet respecting the existing use of materials and colors on the existing two-story addition.
Given the sensitivity of the design with respect to the original adobe construction and respecting the later design of the two-story addition, and the above considerations, staff recommends that the Site & Architectural Commission recommend the City Council approve the Special Use Permit.

Request for a Site Development Permit

Much of the specific design elements of the proposed addition have been discussed in the context of the Special Use Permit above. The existing neighborhood along the private driveway is a mix of house designs including scale and materials. Consistency with the existing historic structure is of primary concern when adding on to this home. The existing second story addition sets the direction for the new addition, both of which
are set apart from the adobe portion of the home. The home is set down from the driveway such that the home does a not have a strong presence on the driveway. The proposed addition does not present a strong visual impact from the homes along the private drive and does not dominate any vista along Daves Avenue.
The property owner, through the resubmittal has worked to minimize the encroachments into the side setback and redesigned the additions to eliminate previously perceived impacts on privacy to the adjacent property downslope. Additional efforts have been taken to plant privacy screening along the property line that will benefit both the subject property and the downslope property.
Per Section 10.08.050(B) of the City of Monte Sereno Municipal Code, no Site Development Permit shall be issued unless the following findings are made:
1 . Whether the proposed improvement and/or use is compatible with the character of the surrounding neighborhood in which it would be located.

18041 Saratoga - Los Gatos Road, Monte Sereno, CA 95030 Tel: 408.354.7635 Fax: 408.395,7635 E-mall: cltyhall@cityofmontesereno.org

SITE & ARCHITECTURAL COMMISSION 18240 DAVES AVENUE
OCTOBER 7, 2020 PAGE 9 OF 11

The proposed addition is compatible with the character of the surrounding neighborhood in that there is a mix of home styles in the immediate area and the existing adobe construction and proposed addition add to that mixed character. There are existing two-story homes that exhibit a mix of mass and square footage. The extension of the existing second floor on the subject home would not add to the mass of the structure such it that it is out of character with the
surrounding homes.

2. Whether the orientation and location of the buildings take into consideration the visual impact which could result from the proposed improvement and/or use.
The proposed addition is adjacent to the south wall and serves as an extension of the previous two-story addition. The existing home is set atop the lot which slopes down to the west. A heavy tree canopy buffers any view of the existing home as well as the new addition to the home from the street below. Additional
landscaping has been installed along the south property line to create an enhanced privacy screen between adjacent properties. The existing home is set down from with the existing two-story portion adjacent to the private driveway. The proposed additions are below and to the west of the existing construction thus do not present a visual impact along the private driveway.

3. Whether the proposed improvements, including architecture, are consistent with the City's design guidelines.

The existing home is an identified historic structure eligible for inclusion on both the California and National Register of Historical Resources. The California Secretary of Interior Standards for the Treatment of Historic Structures are the standards to be followed when proposing any alteration to such a structure. Per the Secretary of Interior's Standards, "New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction will not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that characterize the property. The new work will be differentiated from the old and will be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its
environment."

As proposed, the addition preserves the predominance of the exterior of the existing adobe construction and integrates a small portion of it within the interior of the proposed addition. The location of the addition is sited as to preserve the structural integrity of the existing adobe construction by keeping it adjacent to the existing structure. The proposed second story addition is consistent with the previous two-story addition through the use of materials and location.

Although the City's design guidelines encourages working with the existing terrain and step construction down the hill, the presence of an existing structure

18041 Saratoga - Los Gatos Road. Monte Sereno, CA 95030 Tel: 408.354.7635 Fax: 408.395.7635 E-mall: cityhall@cityofmontesereno.org

18240 DAVES AVENUE SITE & ARCHITECTURAL COMMISSION
PAGE 10 OF 11 OCTOBER 7, 2020

constrained by historic and structural characteristics as well as internal layout makes it impractical to propose living area stepped down the hill creating a third
level of living area and further disconnecting it from the established floor plan. Additionally, stepping any construction down the steep terrain would only serve to bring living area closer to the adjacent property's outdoor yard and pool areas.

The scale of the proposed addition blends with the scale of the existing two-story construction and represents a continuation of the previously approved second floor
addition. The home is set down from the driveway so is several feet below grade
thus minimizing any visual impact the new second story addition has on the
immediate neighborhood along the private drive.

Design modification have been made with this submittal to further reduce any
perceived impacts on the adjacent property by reducing window area, eliminating
existing and proposed second story decks and balconies, dropping the addition down a foot, and including a privacy wall at the first floor deck area which is fully within the required setback.

The proposed design is sensitive to the existing design and the historic character of the home. Given the compatibility in scale and architecture, minimal visual impact on the surrounding neighborhood, and integration of design and landscape elements to address perceived privacy concerns, the proposed project is consistent with the City's Design Guidelines and the State's Secretary of Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Structures..

4. If applicable, whether the proposed improvement and/or use will provide for minimum grading and retention of the natural contours of the land then existing in order to protect the natural slope of the lot.

The proposed addition is an extension of the existing structure at the top of the slope on the existing flat area of the lot. Placement of the addition in this area
minimizes grading and retains the existing natural contours of the hill below.

5. If applicable, whether the proposed improvement and/or use provides for:

a. Retention of significant trees as defined elsewhere in the Code, unless the findings required by Section 10.15.080 of the Code can be made;

The proposed addition will not remove any significant trees.

b. Preservation of solar access.

The proposed addition is set down to the west side of the driveway with no other homes in the way. No solar access is blocked.

Given the findings above, staff recommends that the Site & Architectural Commission recommend that the City Council approve the Site Development Permit.

California Environmental Quality Act

Per the California Environmental Quality Act, the subject permits are Categorically
Exempt under CEQA Guidelines section 15301(e), Existing Facilities of the Guidelines in that the proposal does not exceed 10,000 square feet and the area is served by public services to allow for maximum development permissible in the General Plan (one single-family home). Additionally, the proposed construction is within the
existing developed site and not on any environmentally sensitive lands. Alternatively, the project is exempt pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15303, which allows
construction of a single-family residence in a residential zone, including modifications thereto. The exceptions to the categorical exemptions in CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2 do not apply to this project. The proposed addition to the historic adobe home is consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Treatment of
Historic Properties for rehabilitation as the addition is adjacent to the historic
construction and the materials used are consistent with a previous addition, and
therefore the project is unlikely to cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource. Additionally, the project is not located in a
particularly sensitive environment, does not involve a hazardous waste site or a
scenic highway, and is unlikely to create a cumulative impact as there are no
presently anticipated subsequent projects. Lastly, when compared to other addition projects within the City, staff have been unable to identify anything about this proposed project that could be considered an unusual circumstance, and it does not appear that any unusual circumstances regarding the project have the potential to have a significant effect on the environment.
