I

2 INTRODUCTION

1. On August 24, 2021, the City of Watsonville ("City") by and through the City

4 Council (collectively "Respondents") approved a Resolution adopting Mitigated Negative
Declaration, and adopted a Resolution approving a General Plan Map Amendment, Zoning Map

6 Amendment, Planned Development, Major Subdivision (Tentative Map), and Special Use Permit

7 with Design Review and Specific Development Plan (PP2018-11) to allow the construction of

8 the 21 a townhomes on a 1.57 acre site located at 547 Airport Boulevard (APN 015-321-01)
9 (approvals are hereinafter referred to as the "Project"). The Project is located within Safety Zone

10 6 of the Watsonville Municipal Airport per the California Division of Aeronautics (CDOA)

11 Airport Land Use Planning Handbook (CDOA) Handbook). The Respondents adopted
12 Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") for the Project because they erroneously determined

13 that there is no fair argument that the Project may have a significant effect on the environment.
14 2. The Project is located at 547 Airport Boulevard across the street from the

15 Watsonville Municipal Airport and within the City of Watsonville. The Project does not comply

16 with the Court orders resulting from binding decisions in Watsonville Pilots Association V. City
17 of Watsonville, 183 Cal.App.4th 1059 (2010) ("'WPA P') and Watsonville Pilots Association v.

18 City of Watsonville, et al Case No. CV176416 ("WPA II'), which require the City to incorporate
19 the CDOA Handbook into its General Plan. This is exacerbated by the fact that Respondents
20 adopted a General Plan Amendment to allow development to proceed within Safety Zone 6.
21 3. The Mitigated Negative Declaration unjustifiably concludes:

22 The risk level is "low" for Zone 6. While the site is geographically close to the airport,
23 the site is located in Zone 6, the Traffic Pattern Zone, which is the furthest zone from the airport's runways. Therefore, the project would not result in a safety hazard for people
24 residing or working in the project area and the impact would be less than significant.

25 However, such a conclusion falls flat without proper adherence to the standards and required
26 analysis set forth in the CDOA Handbook:
27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF
2

P If a lead agency prepares an environmental impact report for a project situated within
2 airport land use compatibility plan [ALUCP] boundaries, or, if an airport land use
compatibility plan has not been adopted, for a project within two nautical miles of a
3 public airport or public use airport, the Airport Land Use Planning Handbook published by the Division of Aeronautics of the Department of Transportation, in compliance with 4 Section 21674.5 of the Public Utilities Code and other documents, shall be utilized as

5 technical resources to assist in the preparation of the environmental impact report as the report relates to airport-related safety hazards and noise problems.
6

7 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21096; CEQA Guidelines, § 15154, subd. (a).)

8 4. Petitioner Watsonville Pilots Association ("Petitioner") is concerned with the

9 Respondents' failure to conduct adequate environmental review under the California

10 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA" - Pub. Resources Code § 21000 et seq.). A fair argument

11 exists that the Project may have significant impacts and the MND fails to comply with to water

12 and air quality. The MND also fails to provide a sufficient analysis regarding the Project's noise

13 impacts and contribution to cumulative impacts. Pub. Resources Code, § 21096; CEQA

14 Guidelines, § 15154, subd. (a).)

15 5. The City is more constrained as a result of the Court of Appeal's decision in WPA

16 I. Pursuant to WPA I, the City is mandated to incorporate the Handbook in a manner that leaves

17 no discretion. Here, the City is changing the General Plan designation for the Project site to

18 high-density residential development and the City still fails to incorporate the Handbook into the

19 General Plan as required by WPA I. The City's repeated failed to comply with the State

20 Aeronautics Act and incorporate the CDOA Handbook is failure to proceed in a manner

21 required by law and a failure to follow a mandatory duty.

22 6. On August 26, 2021, Respondents filed a Notice of Determination and, pursuant

23 to Public Resources Code Section 21167, this action was filed within 30 days thereof.

2 PARTIES

3 7. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference Paragraphs 1 through 6 as if fully set

4 forth herein.

5 8. Petitioner WATSONVILLE PILOTS ASSOCIATION is a California non-profit

6 corporation consisting of individuals dedicated, inter alia, to the preservation, protection and
7 enhancement of the Watsonville Municipal Airport as a regional, public-use facility and to the

8 environs of said Airport. Said Petitioner's purpose includes, but is not limited to, providing
9 technical and operational information for public officials and teachers regarding aviation safety
10 regulation and Airport Land Use Planning. Its members are residents of the City of Watsonville

11 and the County of Santa Cruz, and include residents of the area of said City and County whose
12 interests include preservation and enhancement of the integrity of the Watsonville Airport which
13 will be adversely affected by the lack of legally adequate environmental review under CEQA as
14 well as the violation of the State Aeronautics Act.

15 9. Respondent CITY OF WATSONVILLE is a charter city organized under the laws
16 of the State of California and is the owner of the Watsonville Airport. Respondent City has
17 responsibility, as a responsible agency, for complying with and enforcing all applicable laws
18 related to CEQA with regard to the approval of the Project. Pursuant to the State Aeronautics Act

19 the City has a duty to incorporate the CDOA Handbook into its General Plan and find the Project
20 to be consistent with such General Plan in order to make required findings for the Project.
21 10. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate or otherwise, of
22 Does 1-15 are unknown to Petitioner who therefore sue said Respondents by such fictitious

23 names and will seek leave to amend this Petition when their identities have been ascertained.

24 11. Petitioner is informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Respondents
25 and each of them were the agents and employees of each of the remaining Respondents and

26 while doing the things herein alleged, were acting within the course and scope of such agency

27 and employment.

2 Real Party in Interest, Raoul Ortiz, is an owner and applicant for the

3 Project being proposed and properly named as a Real Party in a Interest pursuant to Public

4 Resources Code section 21167.6.5.(a), which states Petitioner shall name as a Real Party in
Interest any person or persons

5 13. identified in the Notice of Determination filed by Respondents.

6 Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Real Party in

7 Interest, Eve Ortiz, is an owner o the Project or the property on which the Project will be

situated.

8 14.

9 The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise, of

10 Does 16 through 30 are unknown to Petitioner who therefore sue said Real Parties in Interest

11 by such fictitious names and will seek leave to amend this Petition for Writ of Mandamus

when their identities have been ascertained.

12 15. Petitioner is informed and believe that at all times herein alleged, Real Parties
13 in Interest and each of them were the agents and employees of each of the remaining Real
14 Parties in Interest and while doing the things herein alleged, were acting within the course and
15 scope of such agency and employment.

17 STANDING

18 16.

19 Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 15 as if fully
set forth herein.

20 17. Approval of the Project will adversely affect the interests of Petitioner
21 WATSONVILLE PILOTS ASSOCIATION. Petitioner has a strong interest in the preservation

22

23 of the environment and the environs of the Watsonville Municipal Airport. Members of

24 Petitioner reside in the City of Watsonville and the County of Santa Cruz, and include residents

25 affected by the Project and whose interests will be adversely affected by the violations of CEQA
and the State Aeronautics Act. Approval of the Project and adoption of an MND, and continued
26 violations of the State Aeronautics Act, adversely affect these interests of Petitioner. Petitioner

2 litigation by individual members is not required.

3 18. Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to California Code of Civil

4 Procedure §$ 1085 and 1094.5; California Public Resources Code 21167; CEQA Guidelines

5 § 15112; the Constitution of the State of California; the Constitution of the United States; and

9 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

10 19. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 18 as if fully
11 set forth herein.

12 20. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition by
13 themselves or others, raising each and every issue known to them before Respondents, in
14 compliance with Public Resources Code § 21177, Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085 and

15 1094.5, and other applicable laws.

16 21. Notice of the filing of this action as required by Public Resources Code
17 21167.5 was mailed to Respondent on September 23, 2021. (Letter and Proof of Service are
18 attached hereto as Exhibit "A.")

21 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

22 Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act

23 [Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq.]

24 22. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 21 as if fully

25 set forth herein.

26 23. Respondents' adoption of an MND constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion

27 a because a fair argument exists that the Project may have a significant effect on the

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF
6

environment. "With certain limited exceptions, a public agency must prepare an EIR whenever

2 substantial evidence supports a fair argument that a proposed project 'may have a significant a

3 effect on the environment.™ Protect Niles v. City of Fremont (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 1129,

4 1138-1139.

24. CEQA requires that Respondents adequately and accurately disclose, evaluate,

6 and mitigate the impacts of the Project. The City was required to use the CDOA Handbook in

7 preparing the section of the MND that addressed airport-related safety hazards. (WPA I at 1081.)

8 However, the MND merely mentions the CDOA Handbook. The MND is bereft of any analyses

9 of whether the development is actually compatible with said Handbook. Therefore, it is
10| impossible to know whether the Project meaningfully considers the Handbook's goal to

11 "minimize the public's exposure to excessive noise and safety hazards" while providing for the
12  "orderly expansion of airports." (Pub.Util.Code § 21670(a)(2).)
13 25. The CDOA Handbook points out "Noise is sometimes perceived to be the most
14 significant concern generated by aircraft operations, and it can be audible for miles from an
15 airport." (CDOA Handbook, p. xi.) Therefore, "With regard to noise and overflight, the goal of
16 airport compatibility planning is to reduce annoyance and to minimize the number of people
17 exposed to excessive levels of aircraft noise." (CDOA Handbook, p. xi.) Despite the fact that
18 the Watsonville Airport is an active take-off and landing site for aircraft, which are undeniably
19 loud, there is no such mention of the effect of noise in relation to the Watsonville Airport within
20 the MND. The noise and overflight analysis must be done in accordance with the CDOA

21 Handbook, which the MND does not dutifully follow, and residential projects are required to

22 analyze noise and overflights in Safety Zone 6. The MND admits that the Project is within

23 Safety Zone 6.

24 26. Furthermore, there is a lack of analysis regarding the safety of the Project.
25| According to the CDOA Handbook, "The concept of safety is more difficult to define than the

26 concept of noise. Safety issues are considered for both those living and working near an airport

27 as well as those using the airport." (CDOA Handbook, p. xi.) As it follows, "Proper safety and
28

-

2 airspace protection minimizes the number of people on and off of the airport that are exposed to

3 the risks associated with potential aircraft accidents and avoids flight hazards that interfere with
aircraft navigation." (CDOA Handbook, p. xi.)

4 27.

5 only cursory, The Mitigated Negative Declaration's discussion of potential safety hazards is not

6 but also entirely flawed because the City has not yet incorporated the CDOA
Handbook into its General Plan, as required by the State Aeronautic Act and the holding in WPA
7 I. The court in Resource Defense Fund v. County of Santa Cruz (1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 800,

8 806, held that "[s]ince consistency with the general plan is required, absence of a valid general
9 plan, or valid relevant [] elements or components thereof, precludes enactment of zoning
10

11 ordinances and the like." Thus, without a valid general plan, the City cannot rely on the MND to

12 conclude the Project complies with CEQA, the State Aeronautics Act and the CDOA Handbook.

13 Therefore, a fair argument exists that the Project will create a significant impact. "The fair
argument standard is a 'low threshold' test for requiring the preparation of an EIR. It is a
14 question of law, not fact, whether a fair argument exists, and the courts owe no deference to the
15

16 lead agency's determination. Review is de novo, with a preference for resolving doubts in favor

17 of environmental review." Protect Niles v. City of Fremont, supra, 25 Cal.App.5th at 1139,
emphasis in original.

21 [SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION]

22 Violation of the State Aeronautics Act

28.

23 Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs: through 27 as if fully
set forth herein.

24 29. Pursuant to Public Utilities Code Section 21670.1(e), as an amendment of the
25 General Plan of a city affected by an airport, the general plan is required to incorporate:

26

27 (1) the height, use, noise, safety and density criteria that are compatible with airport operations as established by the California State Aeronautics Act (CDOA
Handbook)
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATOR Y RELIEF
8

(2) all federal aviation regulations, including, but not limited to, Part 77

2 (commencing with Section 77.1) of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

Despite the fact that the aforementioned decisions in WPA I and WPA II made clear that
4
inclusion of the CDOA Handbook criteria in the general plan is mandatory, Respondent City has

6 failed to comply with the return to the writ and comply with the legal mandate that it incorporate

7 the CDOA Handbook criteria into non-discretionary provisions in its General Plan. Therefore,

8 the City cannot make the necessary findings that the Project complies with a valid General Plan

9 and under those circumstances cannot approve the Project.
10
30. The Respondent City's approval of the Project violates the State Aeronautics Act as
11

12 applied by WPA I and WPA II. The State Aeronautics Act requires that in order for Respondent

13 City to remain in compliance with the Act without being subject to a Countywide Airport Land

14 Use Commission it must adopt and apply:

15 the height, use, noise, safety, and density criteria that are compatible with airport
16 operations as established by this article, and referred to as the Airport Land Use Planning Handbook, published by the division, and any applicable federal aviation regulations,
17 including, but not limited to, Part 77 (commencing with Section 77.1) of Title 14 of the

18 Code of Federal Regulations, as part of the general and specific plans for the county and for each affected city.
19 Pub. Utilities Code §21670.1(d)(2).
20
31. CDOA has informed Respondents in other instances that proceeding with
21

22 approvals of Project that do not comply with the foregoing requirements of the SAA.

23 32. The April 28, 2008 Judgment of this Court requires the City of Watsonville to

24 comply with the injunction that prohibits implementing the "Watsonville Vista 2030 General

25 Plan or Resolution 74-05 or basing any action on or engaging in any activity pursuant to the
26 Watsonville Vista 2030 General Plan or Resolution 74-05...." The City of Watsonville did not
27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF
9

F comply with the injunction in this instance because the 2005 General Plan does not comply with

2 the State Aeronautics Act.
3
33. Respondents continue to proceed with approval of projects, or are threatening to
4

5 proceed with approvals of other projects, without incorporating the CDOA Handbook into the

6 City's General Plan.

7 34. As set forth, the Respondents are failing to carry out their duties under the State

8 Aeronautics Act. No development can be approved within the Airport Safety Zones until the
9 City has converted the Handbook into mandatory provisions in its General Plan. State law
10
establishes Airport Safety Zones around airports and makes compliance mandatory as to the
11

12 Watsonville Airport..

13

VIII 14
ATTORNEYS' FEES 15

16 35. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs through 34 as if fully

17 set forth herein.

18 36. In pursuing this action, Petitioner will confer a substantial benefit on the

19 People of the State of California and therefore is entitled to recover from Respondents and Real

20 Parties in Interest reasonable attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to California Code of Civil

21 Procedure § 1021.5 and other provisions of the law.

VIII 23

INJUNCTION 24

26 set forth herein.

27

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF
10

38. An actual controversy has arisen concerning Respondents' failure to comply with

2 CEQA and the State Aeronautics Act, as set forth above.

3 39. As a result of the above-alleged violations of CEQA and the State Aeronautics

4 Act, Respondents have failed to conduct adequate environmental review as required by law and

5 have failed to proceed in a manner required by law in approving the Project, and threatening to

6 approve additional projects in violation of the State Aeronautics Act and court orders in WPA I
7 and WPA III.

8 40. At all times mentioned herein, Respondents have been able to comply with
9 CEQA, prepare adequate environmental review, and comply with all relevant provisions of the
10 State Aeronautics Act and other provisions of law. Notwithstanding such an ability,

11 Respondents have failed and continue to fail to perform their duty to comply with CEQA, the
12 State Aeronautics Act, court orders, and all other relevant provisions of law.

13 41. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis allege, that Real Parties are
14 threatening to proceed with development of the Project, and Respondents are threatening to
15 approve other projects in airport safety zones, in the near future. Said implementation of the
16 Project will irreparably harm the environment and will result in significant and unmitigated
17 adverse environmental impacts. Approval of additional projects within airport safety zones will

18 violate the State Aeronautics Act and court orders.

19 42. Petitioner possesses no speedy, adequate remedy at law, in that implementation

20 and development in connection with the Project will permanently and forever harm, injure,

21 degrade, and impact the environmental values of the City of Watsonville and the County of Santa

22 Cruz and the State of California. Petitioner will suffer irreparable and permanent injuries if

23 Respondents' actions described herein are not set aside.

24 43. A stay and/or restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunction

25 should issue restraining Real Parties from proceeding with development of the Project and

26 restraining Respondents from approving other projects within airport safety zones unless and

27

28

until the CDOA Handbook is incorporated into the City's General Plan pursuant to the court

4 preliminary and permanent injunction should issue staying Respondents' approval of the

10 set forth herein.

11 38. An actual controversy has arisen concerning Respondents' failure to comply with
12 CEQA, the State Aeronautics Act, and court orders as set forth above.
13 39. A Declaratory Judgment is necessary to resolve the actual dispute described
14 herein.

15 40. Petitioner therefore seeks a judicial determination regarding the respective rights
16 and duties of Petitioner and Respondents. Specifically, Petitioner seeks a judicial determination
17 that Respondents are required by law to comply with CEQA, the State Aeronautics Act, and

18 Court Orders as set forth above.

Pursuant to the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5, this letter will serve as notice that Watsonville Pilots Association (Petitioner) will commence litigation against the City of Watsonville and City Council of the City of Watsonville (Respondents).
This litigation challenges the actions of Respondents concerning the August 24, 2021 approval of a Resolution adopting a Mitigated Negative Declaration, and adoption of a Resolution approving a General Plan Map Amendment, Zoning Map Amendment, Planned Development, Major Subdivision (Tentative Map), and Special Use Permit with Design Review and Specific Development Plan (PP2018-11) to allow the construction of the 21 townhomes on a 1.57 acre site located at 547 Airport Boulevard (APN 015-321-01).
The litigation has been commenced because the actions listed in the preceding paragraph do not comply with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code $ 21000 § et seq.) and the State Aeronautics Act.
Very truly yours,
WITTWER PARKIN LLP

William P. Parkin
