2 INTRODUCTION

3 1.

4 This action challenges the certification by the City Council of the City of Pacifica, and
the City of Pacifica (collectively "Pacifica" or

5 "Respondents") of an Initial Study and Mitigated

6 Negative Declaration--and approval of a Site Development Permit PSD-714-02, Use Permit UP-904-

7 02, Subdivision SUB-204-02, Heritage Tree Removal Authorization and Logging Operation

8 Approval, and a Mitigation Monitoring & Reporting Program in reliance thereonwithout the proper

9 level of environmental review of potentially significant adverse impacts. Pacifica has failed to

10 prepare an EIR (Environmental Impact Report) for the Vista Mar project ("Project"), despite

11 overwhelming exert opinion of potentially significant adverse biological, health risk, geomorphology,

12 hydrology, plan inconsistency, and aesthetics impacts; and that the significance of these impacts will

13 not be reduced to insignificance by the Project's proposed mitigation measures.

2.

14 This action also challenges Pacifica's Project approvals in reliance on the Pacifica

15 General Plan ("General Plan") which, adopted in 1980 and never updated but for a 2015 Housing

16 Element, is legally inadequate, fatally out-of-date and internally inconsistent. Further, the Project is

17 inconsistent with numerous policies of even the 1980 General Plan, policies adopted to protect

18 significant trees, protect creeks and their riparian habitats, prohibit development on slopes over 35%,

19 maintain natural open space between areas of development, and discourage mass grading and
terracing.

20 3.

21 The Project is proposed for a 1.2 acre sloping site covered with native vegetation and

22 trees. It contains a stream and an onsite drainage channel that carries water for most all of the year.

23 The Project applicant and Pacifica have been informed these are likely jurisdictional Waters of the
United States and Water of the State.

24 4.

25 Project construction and operation could result in potentially significant adverse health

26 risk impacts, including an excess cancer risk over the course of a residential lifetime which is 20

27 times greater than the significance threshold established by the Bay Area Air Quality Management

28 District for infant, child, and lifetime cancer risks. In addition, experts opined that the Initial Study
and Mitigated Negative Declaration fail to adequately evaluate the Project's air quality, health risk, or

2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 greenhouse gas impacts.

2 5. The Project site is also likely to suffer from slope destabilization and erosion even

3 with the mitigation measures proposed. Plus, the Project will construct at least two housing units into

4 an excavation formed from landslide deposits, and will be 10 feet below the water table.

5 6. The Project will likely result in potentially significant biological impacts from the loss

6 of bird nests, loss of bird fledglings from habitat loss and habitat fragmentation.

7 7. The Project may also have a potentially significant impact on riparian habitat and

8 wetlands resulting from filling and permanent destruction of 96 feet of a stream and stream channel

9 on a steep slope, fed by a perennial seep and connected to other jurisdictional waters, and destruction

10 of 0.26 acres of riparian arroyo willow thickets, an indicator plant for wetland.

11 8. The Project will result in potentially significant adverse aesthetic impacts and be
12 aesthetically out of scale for the neighborhood - based on the prominent location of the site on a

13 steep hill, the Project's massing near the front setback line, the Project overshadowing the majority of
14 the area's existing housing, Project incompatibility with the neighborhood pattern, and that the trees,
15 natural features and natural grades will be completely altered on over 58% of the site, including

16 removal of 57 trees, six of which are Pacifica Heritage Trees

17 9. This Project has a checkered past. Proposed development at the Project site by the
18 Project applicant, Defendant Chavarria, was denied by the Pacifica Planning Commission as far back
19 as 1991, and geotechnical review in 1992 raised serious concerns based on very steep slopes,
20 potential geologic hazards, and concerns with landslide debris flow.
21 10. Pacifica's certification of a Negative Declaration for the Project violates the California
22 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq., and the CEQA
23 Guidelines, California Code of Regulations, Title 14, section 15000 et seq. as there was substantial
24 evidence before Pacifica of potentially significant adverse biological, health risk, geomorphology,
25 hydrology, plan inconsistency, and aesthetics impacts - that will not be reduced by any of the

26 proposed mitigation measures.

27 11. Pacifica's approval of the Project in reliance on an inadequate, out-of-date and
28 internally inconsistent General Plan violates California's general plan law. (Gov't Code, § 65300 et

2 seq.) In addition, the Project is inconsistent with numerous General Plan policies.

12.

3 Pacifica prejudicially abused its discretion by failing to proceed as required by law,

4 and because these violations of law precluded informed public participation and informed decision
making.

5 13.

6 This is also an action for appropriate injunctive relief in the event that Respondents

7 and Real Parties in Interest proceed to implement their decisions and approvals described herein prior
to the final resolution of this action.

8 14.

9 Pacifica's violations of CEQA and California's general plan law, and approval of the

10 Project based thereon, will harm Petitioners, its members and the public - as environmental values

11 will be degraded without the required level of environmental review and without planning in accord
with an adequate general plan.

12 PARTIES

13 Plaintiffs/Petitioners

14 15.

15 Petitioner Coalition of Pacificans For An Updated Plan ("COALITION") is a non-

16 profit California unincorporated association. COALITION is a broad and robust coalition with

17 members living throughout Pacifica that seeks to propel Pacifica forward by compelling sound

18 planning decisions backed by thorough and unbiased environmental and safety reviews, as well as in

19 compliance with environmental law. COALITION is concerned about the woefully inadequate
Pacifica General Plan, which has not been updated in forty years. COALITION is concerned that this
20 out-of-date General Plan is leading to poor land use decisions that do not comply with legal

21

22 requirements and that, as a result, may jeopardize public health, safety and the environment.

16.

23 COALITION participated in the administrative proceedings by inter alia submitting

24 written and verbal comments on the Project, including inter alia Pacifica's violations of CEQA and

25 reliance on, and inconsistency with, the General Plan. COALITION brings this action on behalf of

26 themselves, their adversely affected members and the public at large.

17.

27 Petitioner KRISTIN CRAMER is a Pacifica resident concerned about the Project's

28 potentially significant adverse impacts, the absence of mitigation measures for these impacts, reliance
on an out-of-date and internally inconsistent General Plan, and Project inconsistency with General

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- Plan policies designed to protect the environment. KRISTIN CRAMER participated in the
2 administrative proceedings by inter alia submitting written and verbal comments on the Project,

4 including inter alia Pacifica's violations of CEQA and reliance on, and inconsistency with, the

5 General Plan. KRISTIN CRAMER brings this action on behalf of herself and the public at large.

18.

6 Petitioners, and each of them, have a direct and beneficial interest in Pacifica's

7 compliance with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and California's general plan law. That interest has
been and will continue to be directly and adversely affected by Pacifica's actions challenged herein,

9 which actions violate provisions of law set forth in this action, precluded informed public

10 participation, and would cause substantial harm to the environment. Petitioners will suffer concrete,

11 actual and imminent injury from Pacifica's prejudicial abuse of discretion as well as from

12 implementation of the proposed Project without full CEQA compliance and without an adequate
General Plan and Project compliance therewith.

13 Defendants/Respondents & Real Parties

14 19.

15 Respondent and Defendant CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF PACIFICA ("CITY

16 COUNCIL") is the decision-making body of the CITY OF PACIFICA. On November 23, 2020, the

17 CITY COUNCIL upheld the Pacifica Planning Commission's adoption of the Initial Study/Mitigated

18 Negative Declaration and Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program and Site Development

19 Permit PSD-714-02, Use Permit UP-904-02, Tentative Subdivision SUB-204-02, authorization for

20 heritage tree removal, and authorization for logging operations.

20.

21 Respondent and Defendant the CITY OF PACIFICA ("Pacifica") is, and at all times

22 herein mentioned was, a duly organized governmental entity organized under the Constitution and

23 Laws of the State of California. It is responsible, inter alia, for complying with the Constitution of

24 the State of California and for implementing the laws of the State of California, including CEQA, the

25 CEQA Guidelines, and California's general plan law. Pacifica issued the Initial Study and Mitigated

26 Negative Declaration; responded to comments thereon; certified the Mitigated Negative Declaration;

27 approved Site Development Permit PSD-714-02, Use Permit UP-904-02, Subdivision SUB-204-02,

28 Heritage Tree Removal Authorization and Logging Operation Approval, and a Mitigation Monitoring
& Reporting Program in reliance thereon; and issued the Notice of Determination for the Project.

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

Further, Pacifica issued the 1980 Pacifica General Plan and the 2015 Pacifica General Plan Housing

2 Element.

3 21. On information and belief, MONTEREY ROAD PACIFICA, LLC, is the owner of the

4 Project and is therefore an appropriate Real Party in Interest and Defendant. On information and

5 belief Monterey Road Pacifica, LLC is located at 558 Presidio Blvd #29263, San Francisco, CA

6 94129, and its agent for service of process is John Kontrabecki, 327B Infantry Terrace, San

7 Francisco, CA 94129.

22. The Notice of Determination filed by Pacifica identifies "JAVIER CHAVERRIA

9 VISTA MAR DEVELOPMENT" as the "project applicant." Public Resources Code section
10 21167.6.5(a) requires that a petitioner "shall name, as a real party in interest, the person or persons

11 identified by the public agency in its notice... ." For this reason, Petitioners name JAVIER

12 CHAVERRIA VISTA MAR DEVELOPMENT as a Real Party in Interest and Defendant. However,

13 it appears from the California Secretary of State Business Search database, that no such entity exists.

14 On December 20, 2018, John Kontrabecki informed Pacifica in writing that Vistamar Development is

15 the managing member of Monterey Road Pacifica LLC and that Javier Chavarria of one of the three

16 owners. On information and belief, Javier Chavarria resides at 848 Burns Court, Pacifica, CA 94044.

17 23. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties and

18 Defendants DOES through 20, inclusive, and therefore sue said Real Parties and Defendants under

19 fictitious names. Petitioners will amend its Petition and Complaint to show the true names and

20 capacities of Does 1 through 20 when the same have been ascertained. Each of the Real Parties and

21 Defendants is the agent and/or employee of each other Real Parties and Defendants, and each

22 performed acts on which this action is based within the course and scope of such Real Parties' and

23 Defendants' agency and/or employment. Petitioners are informed and believe and therefore allege

24 that each of the Real Parties and Defendants are legally responsible in some manner for the events

25 and happenings referred to herein.

26 STATEMENT OF FACTS

27 The Project and its Environmental Setting

28 24. The proposed Vista Mar Project would include construction of four separate buildings,

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

each with two attached townhomes for a total of eight residential units on a 1.2 acre site. The Project

2 is proposed to be located at Monterey Road, south of the Monterey Road/Hickey Blvd. intersection in

3 Pacifica at APN 009-381-020.

4 25. The Project site is steep, with slopes over 50%.

5 26. The Project site is tree covered, including approximately 57 trees, at least 6 of these

6 trees considered heritage trees as defined by the Pacifica Municipal Code.

7 27. The Project site contains a stream with a riparian habitat which empties into a storm

8 drain near the southern corner of the site which likely connects to Big Inch Creek which drains into

9 the Pacific Ocean. It is highly possible that this area may be a jurisdictional Water of the United

10 States and Water of the State. The Project proposes to fill this streambed, disrupting the flow of

11 stormwater.

12 28. The Project site also contains a flood corridor and land that may accommodate

13 floodwater for purposes of groundwater recharge and stormwater management.

14 29. There are active and historic landslides on the Project site and on the adjacent uphill

15 area.

16 30. The Project site is within the Milagra Creek watershed in an area known for flooding.

17 There is evidence that flooding has occurred in this area even in a relatively dry winter. The threat

18 from future debris flow down this ravine remains high, and threatens development within or around

19 the swale area of the Project site.
20 31. The deep building foundations proposed for the Project will interfere with the flow of

21 shallow groundwater, resulting in flooding.

22 32. The Project grading plan calls for 6,453 cubic yards of cut material and 3,443 cubic

23 yards of fill material. The grading phase of the Project is anticipated to take two months, during

24 which time there is expected to be up to 5 one-way truck trips per day. Building construction is

25 estimated to take 14 months.

26 33. To build the Project, the site would be scraped of virtually all trees and other

27 vegetation, deep graded and recontoured, drainage and potentially jurisdictional waters/wetlands

28 filled, thus destroying the visual and biological integrity of the Project site.

7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

Pacifica's General Plan

2 34. Pacifica's General Plan was adopted in 1980.

3 35. Pacifica updated its General Plan Housing Element in 2015, and has not updated any

4 other element of its General Plan since 1980.

5 36. Pacifica's General Plan lacks accurate and up to date maps of flooding and flood

6 related risks, and therefore lacks the information necessary to evaluate the safety implications of the

7 proposed development.

8 37. Pacifica is aware that its General Plan is out-of-date.

9 38. The General Plan Land Use Element adopted in the 1980s identifies the Project parcel
10 as appropriate for Low Density Residential development. The 2015 General Plan Housing Element at

11 Table III-1 identifies the Project site as being "flat" and appropriate for housing. In contrast, the 2015

12 General Plan Housing Element at Table III-2 does not identify the parcel as being appropriate for
13 housing.

14 39. The General Plan Land Use Element indicates that sites with slopes in excess of 35%
15 may not be developable: "Only three areas with slopes less than 35% remain….. development in the

16 lower quarter of the Very Low Density Residential range is most appropriate…Development must be

17 sensitive to the potential physical and visual impacts...." "At the back of Vista Mar are two fingers

18 of the valley which still contain some developable land less than 35% slope."

19 40. The General Plan Seismic Safety and Safety Element notes that the majority of
20 landslides occur on steep slopes, over 35%.

21 Pacifica Review, Expert Comment and Project Approval

22 41. In 1991, Defendant Chavarria brought an almost identical project of 9 units to Pacifica
23 which was denied both by the Planning Commission and by the City Council.

24 42. The September 3, 1991 Planning Staff Report to the Planning Commission advised:

25 "The site requires inordinate grading and retaining walls for the proposed
26 development. The design guidelines state that retaining walls should be avoided and their height reduced to the minimum feasible."..."geologically fragile and unstable 27 areas should be avoided... The applicant proposes development within a known slide

28 area ...The site is not physically suitable for the type of development proposed, and .retaining walls that are incompatible with the site and surrounding developments.

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

As a result of the substantial site grading, the planning commission finds that the design .. likely to cause substantial environmental damage.'
2 43. On July 8, 2015, Pacifica's Planning Director Tina Weirmeister informed Defendant
Chaverria that the general plan defines the Project site as unstable, and that Pacifica requires designs
4 that limit retaining walls.

5 44. The Planning Commission held public hearings on the Project on August 3, 2020 and
6 October 19, 2020.

45. Two appeals of the Pacifica Planning Commissions' Project approval were timely
8 filed: one by the Vista Mar Preservation Alliance on October 27, 2020 and a second by Kristin
9 Cramer on October 28, 2020.
10 46. Dr. Shawn Smallwood, PhD submitted expert opinion that the Project will result in
11 potentially significant adverse biological impacts, even with implementation of the proposed
12 mitigation measures, based on (1) the loss of bird nests and loss of bird fledglings from habitat loss,
13 (2) interference with wildlife movement in the region, (3) habitat fragmentation, and (4) likely bird
14 death from window collisions from the Project.
15 47. Christine Boles, a license architect, concluded that the Project will result in
16 potentially significant adverse aesthetic impacts based on the prominent location of the site on a steep
17 hill, the Project's massing near the front setback line, the Project's relative height overshadowing the
18 majority of the area's existing housing, Project incompatibility with the neighborhood pattern, and
19 that the trees, natural features and natural grades will be completely altered on over 58% of the site,
20 including removal of 57 trees.
21 48. Soil Water Air Protection Enterprise ("SWAPE") concluded that Project construction
22 and operation could result in a potentially significant adverse health risk impact, including an excess
23 cancer risk over the course of a residential lifetime which is 20 times greater than the threshold of
24 significance established by the Bay Area Air Quality Management District for infant, child, and
25 lifetime cancer risks. Further, the Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration fail to adequately
26 evaluate the Project's air quality, health risk, or greenhouse gas impacts.
27 49. Steve Bond, a professional geologist, concluded that the Project is likely to result in
28

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

F significant adverse impacts, including (1) slope destabilization resulting from the Project raising of

2 the water table, and (2) erosion from fugitive groundwater seeps subsequent to an elevated water

3 table - even with the mitigation measures proposed.

4 50. On October 16, 2020 and November 23, 2020, Kristin Cramer submitted written

5 comments urging Pacifica to refrain from approving the Project based on violations of CEQA and

6 California's general plan law.

7 51. On November 22, 2020, the Coalition submitted written comments urging Pacifica to

8 refrain from approving the Project because Pacifica's General Plan is woefully out-of-date, legally

9 inadequate and inconsistent in respects that bear a nexus to the proposed Project. The letter explained

10 that Pacifica has failed in its duty to "periodically review and revise, as necessary, the general plan,"

11 as required by Gov. code sect. 65103(a), because the 1980 General Plan had not been revised in forty

12 years (except for the Housing Element, which was updated in 2015). The letter explained that
13 Pacifica has failed in its duty to update the Conservation Element of the General Plan to identify

14 flooding risks, creeks and streams, when it updated the Housing Element in 2015, in violation of

15 Gov. Code sect. 65402(d)(3). The letter further explained that Pacifica failed to update the Safety

16 Element of the General Plan to identify flood hazard zones and slope instability risks in 2015 when it

17 updated the Housing Element, in violation of Gov. Code sect. 65302(g). The letter also explained

18 that the General Plan is internally inconsistent in respects relevant to the Project. Finally, the letter

19 explained that the Project is inconsistent with the inadequate 1980 General Plan.

20 52. On November 23, 2020, the City Council considered the two appeals of the Pacifica

21 Planning Commission's approval of the Project, and adopted a resolution denying the appeals and

22 upholding the Planning Commission's adoption of the Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration

23 and Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program and Site Development Permit PSD-714-02, Use

24 Permit UP-904-02, Tentative Subdivision SUB-204-02, authorization for heritage tree removal, and
25 authorization for logging operations.

26 53. On November 25, 2020, San Mateo County filed Pacifica's Notice of Determination
27 for the Project.

28 PROCEDURAL ALLEGATIONS

10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

54. Petitioners, as individuals and through their representative and members, have

2 performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant action and have exhausted any and all
available administrative remedies to the extent required by law, inter alia, submitting written and oral

4 comments on the Project and its environmental review during the administrative process.

5 55. Petitioners timely raised each and every significant substantive and procedural issue

6 known to them in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21177 during the review process

7 for this Project. Petitioners requested that Respondents not approve the Initial Study, Mitigated
Negative Declaration based on its CEQA violations. Petitioners requested that Respondents not

9 approve the Project due to the legal inadequacy of the General Plan, due to internal inconsistencies in

10 the General Plan, and due to the fact that the Project is inconsistent with the General Plan. Petitioners

11 requested Respondents not approve this Project until Respondents fully comply with CEQA and until

12 Respondents adopt a legally adequate General Plan. Any further exhaustion would be futile.

13 56. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

14 21167.5 by mailing a written notice of the commencement of this action to Respondents prior to
15 filing this Petition and Complaint. A copy of the prior written notice provided to Respondents, with

16 proof of service thereof, is attached hereto as Exhibit "1".

17 57. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

18 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by mailing a copy of the Petition and Complaint to

19 the state Attorney General. A copy of the notice to the Attorney General is attached hereto as Exhibit
20 | «2"

21 58. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by filing a

22 Request for Preparation of the Administrative Record at the time of filing this Petition and

23 Complaint. The request notified Respondents that Petitioners would elect to prepare the record or

24 that the parties would agree to an alternative method of preparation.

25 59. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

26 sections 1085 (traditional mandate), and 1094.5 (administrative mandate); Public Resource Code

27 section 21168.5 (California Environmental Quality Act); Government Code section 65751 and

28 Article VI, section 10, of the California Constitution.

11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

60. Venue is proper in San Mateo County pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 395

2 because Pacifica is located within San Mateo County, the Project site is located in San Mateo County

3 and because the actions complained of herein occurred within San Mateo County.

61. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law
unless this Court enjoins and mandates that Respondents comply with their duties and set aside the

6 approval of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approvals will remain in

7 effect in violation of CEQA and in violation of California General Plan law.

8 62. If Respondents and Real Parties and their agents are not enjoined from implementing

9 the Project, and from undertaking acts in furtherance thereof, Petitioners will suffer irreparable harm

10 from which there is no adequate remedy at law in that the Project area and surrounding areas would

11 be irrevocably altered and significant unmitigated adverse environmental impacts would occur.

12 Petitioners and the general public have also been harmed by Respondents' failure to prepare an EIR

13 for this Project.

14 63. Petitioners will suffer irreparable harm for which there is no plain, speedy or adequate

15 remedy in the course of ordinary law unless this Court grants the requested relief to require

16 Respondents to prepare bring their General Plan into compliance with the requirements of State law,

17 declares the existing Pacifica General Plan to be in non-compliance with mandatory requirements of

18 State law, and enjoins Pacifica from approving the Project pending completion of an updated General

19 Plan. In absence of such remedies, Respondents' decision will remain in violation of state law.

20 64. In pursuing this action, which involves enforcement of important rights affecting the

21 public interest, Petitioners will confer a substantial benefit on a the general public and citizens of the

22 City of Pacifica, San Mateo County, the San Francisco Bay Area and the State of California, and

23 therefore will be entitled to attorney's fees and costs pursuant to, inter alia, Code of Civil Procedure

24 section 1021.5.

25 65. This Petition / Complaint is timely filed within all applicable statutes of limitations.

26 66. Petitioners bring this action pursuant to Public Resources Code sections 21168 and
27 21168.5 and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5 which require that an agency's

28 approval of a Project be set aside if the agency has prejudicially abused its discretion. Respondents

12

have prejudicially abused their discretion because Respondents have failed to proceed according to

2 the law, and their decision is not supported by substantial evidence, and Respondents have failed to

3 make proper and adequate findings.

4 STATEMENT OF LAW

5 CEQA

6 67. CEQA is an integral part of every public agency's decision making process. (Pub.

7 Res. Code co. 21006.) CEQA was enacted to protect the environment by the establishment of

8 administrative procedures to ensure that long-term protection of the environment shall be the guiding

9 criterion in public decisions.

10 68. The purpose of an EIR is to provide public agencies and the public with "detailed

11 information" about the likely significant environmental effect of a proposed and ways in which the

12 significant effects might be minimized. (§ 21061; see § 21002.1, subd. (a).) An EIR serves not only

13 to protect the environment but also to demonstrate to an apprehensive pubic that it is being protected.

14 (CEQA Guideline 15003, subd. (b).)

15 69. All public agencies must prepare, or cause to be prepared, and certify the completion
16 of an EIR on any project that may have a significant effect on the environment. Pub. Res. Code §§
17 21100(a), 21151(a). A significant effect is "potentially substantial, adverse change." Pub. Res.
18 Code § 21068. This means that an activity has a significant effect if it "has the potential to degrade
19 the quality of the environment." Pub. Res. Code § 21083; 14 C.C.R. § 15065.
20 70. An EIR must be prepared where "there is substantial evidence, in light of the whole

21 record before the agency, that the project may have a significant effect on the environment." Pub.
22 Res. Code § 21080(d). If there is substantial evidence supporting a "fair argument" that a project
23 "may" have a significant environmental effect, the agency "shall" prepare an EIR. CEQA
24 Guideline15064(a)(1). The fair argument standard provides a "low threshold" for requiring the
25 preparation of an EIR, with a preference for resolving doubts in favor of an EIR.

26 71. "Substantial evidence" is "enough relévant information and reasonable inferences

27 from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion, even though other
28 conclusions might also be reached." CEQA Guideline 15384(a). Substantial evidence includes fact, a

18 A general plan must be internally consistent, both among the elements and within each

19 element. Gov. Code con 65300.5; Concerned Citizens of Calaveras Co, 166 Cal.App.3d 90 at 97-98

3 policies without finding an "outright conflict." Napa Citizens for Honest Government v. Napa County

4 Board of Supervisors, 91 Cal.App.4th 342, 357, 379 (2001). A project is inconsistent with general

12 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION FOR VIOLATION OF CEQA

13 (Pub. Res. Code, § 21000 et seq.)
84.
14 Petitioners incorporate by reference herein the preceding paragraphs, as if fully set
forth.
15

16 Claim One - Failure to Prepare an Environmental Impact Report Despite Substantial Evidence
of Potentially Significant Adverse Impacts
17 85. There is substantial evidence, in light of the whole record before Pacifica, that the
18 Project will have a potentially significant biological, health risk, geomorphology, hydrology, plan
19 inconsistency, and aesthetics impacts and that these significant impacts will not be reduced by
20 proposed mitigation measures to a less than significant level. Specifically, there is substantial
21 evidence in the form of facts, reasonable assumptions predicated upon facts, and expert opinion
22 supported by facts that the Project will have these potentially significant adverse impacts - even with
23 the mitigation measures proposed.
24 86. By failing to prepare an EIR, in light of the substantial evidence of potentially
25 significant adverse impacts which will not be reduced by proposed mitigations, Pacifica failed to
26 comply with CEQA and prejudicially abused its discretion.
27 Claim Two - The Initial Study Violates CEQA by Failing to Properly Analyze Projects Impacts
28

16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
8

87. The Initial Study's transportation analysis violates CEQA by omitting any

2 consideration of the Project's construction phase transportation impacts.

3 88. The Initial Study improperly defers the analysis of project impacts, inter alia project

4 biological resource impacts to wetlands and species, until after project approval.

5 89. The Initial Study failed to adequately evaluate the Project's air quality, health risk, or

6 greenhouse gas impacts.

7 90. By certifying a Mitigated Negative Declaration based on a legally inadequate Initial

8 Study, Pacifica failed to comply with CEQA and prejudicially abused its discretion.

9 Claim Three - The Initial Study Violates CEQA by Failing to Analyze Baseline Conditions of
10 Riparian Habitat, Waters of the United States and Wetlands on Site

11 91. The Initial Study fails to adequately define the baseline conditions for riparian habitat,

12 water of the United States, or wetlands. Respondents' certification of the Mitigated Negative

13 Declaration without this analysis violates CEQA.

14 92. By certifying a Mitigated Negative Declaration based on a legally inadequate Initial

15 Study, Pacifica failed to comply with CEQA and prejudicially abused its discretion.

16 Claim Four - The Proposed Mitigation Measures Violate CEQA

17 93. Mitigations IV-4, IV-5 and IV-6 violate, CEQA by improperly deferring the

18 formulation of mitigation measures - without committing to specific performance criteria for judging

19 the efficacy of the measures - for potentially significant impacts to riparian habitat, wetlands and

20 waters of the United States. y

21 94. In addition, many of the mitigation measures violate CEQA as they are generalized

22 goals and not specific performance criteria, as required by law.

23 95. By certifying a Mitigated Negative Declaration based on a legally inadequate Initial

24 Study, Pacifica failed to comply with CEQA and prejudicially abused its discretion.

25 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION FOR VIOLATION OF

26 CALIFORNIA'S GENERAL PLAN LAW
(Gov't Code, $ 65300 èt seq.)

27 96. Petitioners incorporate by reference herein the preceding paragraphs, as if fully set
28 forth.

17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

Claim One - Pacifica Has Failed To Periodically Revise Its General Plan

2 97. Pacifica has failed to periodically review, and revise, as necessary, its general plan

3 which is 40 years old. Gov't Code cop 65103(a); Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors, 52 Cal.

4 3d 553, 572 (1990).

5 98. Respondents' failure to periodically review and revise the General Plan bears a nexus

6 to the Project as alleged herein. For example, in addition to the general plan inadequacies discussed

7 below, Pacifica must periodically review and revise general plan provisions to address slope

8 instability. Gov't Code con 65302(g)(1). The Project is proposed to be located on steep slope in an

9 area with a history of landslides and problems related to instability.

10 Claim Two - Pacifica Has Failed To Keep Its General Plan Current

11 99. Pacifica has failed to keep its General Plan current. DeVita v. Cty. of Napa, 9 Cal. 4th

12 763, 792 (1995). The Pacifica General Plan was adopted in 1980 -- forty years ago - and has not been

13 kept current.

14 100. Respondents' failure to periodically review and revise the General Plan bears a nexus

15 to the Project as alleged herein. For example, in addition to the general plan inadequacies discussed

16 below, Pacifica must periodically review and revisé general plan provisions to address slope

17 instability. Gov't Code 65302(g)(1). The Project is proposed to be located on a steep slope in an

18 area with a history of landslides and problems related to instability.

19 Claim Three - Pacifica Failed To Timely Update Its General Plan Conservation Element

20 101. Pacifica failed to update its General Plan Conservation Element to conform to its 2015

21 Housing Element, and to identify rivers, creeks, streams, flood corridors, riparian habitats, and land

22 that may accommodate floodwater for purposes of groundwater recharge and stormwater

23 management." Gov't Code § 65302(d)(3).

24 102. The inadequacies in the General Plan Conservation Element have a relevant "nexus"

25 to the Vista Mar project as the Conservation Elementüfails to identify the streams, flood corridors,

26 riparian habitats, and land that may accommodate floodwater for purposes of groundwater recharge

27 and stormwater management on the Project site, and the Project site includes a creek, flood corridor,

28 riparian habitat, and land that accommodates floodwater. For these reasons, the Respondents'

18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- approval of the Vista Mar project must be set aside until and unless Pacifica updates its General Plan

2 Conservation Element.

3 103. As the Pacifica general plan is legally inadequate, and those inadequacies have a

4 "nexus" to the Vista Mar project, Respondents' approval of the Vista Mar project was a prejudicial

5 abuse of discretion, and must be set aside.

6 Claim Four - Pacifica Failed To Timely Update Its General Plan Safety Element

7 104. Pacifica failed to update its General Plan Safety Element at the time it updated its

8 2015 Housing Element to identify information regarding flood hazards, including, but not limited to,

9 flood hazard zones, flood insurance maps, historical data on flooding, sites that have been repeatedly
10 damaged by flooding, existing and planned development in flood hazard zones, and establishing

11 goals for protection of the community from unreasonable risks of flooding including evaluating

12 whether new development should be located in flood hazard zones. Gov't Code § 65302(g).

13 105. The inadequacies in the General Plan Safety Element have a relevant "nexus" to the

14 Vista Mar project as the Project site and the surrounding area has been repeatedly been subjected to

15 flooding, because of the stormwater corridor on the site, and because Pacifica has not evaluated

16 whether new development should be located in flood hazard zones. For these reasons, the
17 Respondents' approval of the Vista Mar project must be set aside until and unless Pacifica updates its

18 General Plan Safety Element.

19 106. As the Pacifica General Plan is legally inadequate, and those inadequacies have a

20 "nexus" to the Vista Mar project, Respondents' approval of the Vista Mar project was a prejudicial

21 abuse of discretion, and must be set aside. i-

22 Claim Five - The Pacifica General Plan Is Internally Consistent

23 107. The Pacifica General Plan is internally consistent, both among the elements and within

24 each element. First, the General Plan Land Use Element identification of the Project site as
25 appropriate for Low Density Residential development is inconsistent with the 2015 General Plan

26 Housing Element. Second, the 2015 General Plan Housing Element is internally inconsistent. Third,

27 the Housing Element is inconsistent with the Seismic Safety and Safety Element. Fourth, the Land

28 Use Element is inconsistent with the Seismic Safety and Safety Element.

19
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

.

108. Bach of these inconsistencies have a "nexus" to the Vista Mar project as there can be

2 no more fundamental question under the general plan than whether a parcel can be developed at all.
The current General Plan provides inconsistent, contradictory, and factually inaccurate answers to

4 this question for the Project.

5 109. Respondents' approval of the Vista Mar project was a prejudicial abuse of discretion,

6 and must be set aside. *

7 Claim Six - The Vista Mar Project is Inconsistent With its General Plan

8 110. The Vista Mar Project is inconsistent with numerous General Plan policies, including

9 but not limited to the following:

10 The Vista Mar Project is inconsistent with Conservation Element Policy 3: Protect significant trees

11 as the Project will remove all vegetation and approximately 57 trees, at least 6 of them Heritage

12 Trees.

13 The Vista Mar Project is inconsistent with Conservation Element Policy 5: "Local year round creeks

14 and their riparian habitats shall be protected," as the Project will fill a tributary to Big Inch Creek on

15 site and destroy the related riparian habitat.

16 The Vista Mar Project is inconsistent with the General Plan prohibition of development on slopes

17 over 35% as the Project will develop slopes of over 50%.

18 The Vista Mar Project is inconsistent with Community Design Element Hillside Guidelines,

19 Guideline 1: "Preserve visually significant slopes and ridgelines, maintain natural open space
20 between areas of development, set aside and preserve natural features." as the Project is on a highly

21 visible slope and will involve mass grading and destruction of the natural area.

22 The Vista Mar Project is inconsistent with Community Design Element Hillside Guidelines,

23 Guideline 3: "Fit development to the topography, place man-made structures to complement the

24 natural environment." as the Project will scrape and mass-grade the steep 50% slope, and does the

25 opposite of fitting the development to the natural topography.

26 The Vista Mar Project is inconsistent with Community Design Element Hillside Guidelines,

27 Guideline 4: "Minimize grading; discourage mass grading and terracing for construction pads," as the

28 Project involves mass grading.

20
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

111. Based on each of the Project's above inconsistencies with the Pacifica General Plan,

2 Respondents' approval of the Vista Mar project was a prejudicial abuse of discretion, and must be set

3 aside.

4 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

5 WHEREFORE, Petitioners and Plaintiffs pray for relief as follows:

6 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to void the Mitigated

7 Negative Declaration certification, and to void any and all approvals given for the Project in reliance

8 thereon.

9 2. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to fully comply with CEQA

10 prior to Project approval, and take any other action required pursuant to Public Resources Code

11 section 21168.9.

15 65754(a);

16 4. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside each of its approvals
17 and entitlements for the Vista Mar project because the Pacifica General Plan is legally inadequate in
18 manner that has a nexus to the proposed Project;

19 5. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside each of its approvals
20 and entitlements for the Vista Mar project because the Vista Mar Project is inconsistent with the

21 Pacifica General Plan;

22 6. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to refrain from approving any
23 other projects that have a nexus to the Pacifica General Plan deficiencies set forth in this Petition and

24 Complaint, unless or until the Pacifica General Plan is brought into compliance with the requirements

25 of Government Code Article 5 (commencing with Section 65300);

26 7. For a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and a permanent injunction a

Re: Notice of Intent to File Suit
Vista Mar Project

This letter provides written notice pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5 that Coalition of Pacificans For An Updated Plan, Kristin Cramer and Summer Lee (Petitioners) will file suit on or before December 23, 2020 challenging the City of Pacifica's (Pacifica) certification of a Mitigated Negative Declaration and approval of the Vista Mar Project (Project) in reliance thereon.
The grounds for this lawsuit include, inter alia, that Pacifica has violated CEQA as (1) there is substantial evidence that the Project will have potentially significant biological, health risk, geomorphology, hydrology, and aesthetics impacts and that these impacts will not be reduced to insignificant levels by proposed mitigation measures, (2) the Initial Study fails to properly analyze Project traffic, biological, air quality, health risk and greenhouse gas impacts, (3) the Initial Study fails to properly analyze baseline conditions of riparian habitat, waters of the united states and wetlands on the Project site, (4) formulation of mitigation measures are improperly deferred to after Project approval without committing to specific performance criteria.

Petitioners are willing to immediately begin discussing terms to settle this dispute that could either obviate the need to file this lawsuit or provide for dismissal of the lawsuit once filed. Petitioners present the following settlement demand, in the form of principles that would häve to be embodied in a formal written settlement agreement:

1. Pacifica rescinds its certification of the Mitigated Negative Declaration and sets aside its Project approvals in reliance thereon;

1

2. Pacifica prepares an Environmental Impact Report in compliance
with CEQA prior to Project approval;
3. Pacifica updates its general plan and each mandatory element, and
resolves all internal general plan inconsistencies;
4. Pacifica agrees to stay Project implementation until and unless an EIR for the Project is certified and Pacifica brings its General Plan and each relevant mandatory element into compliance with Government Code section 65300 et seq., or alternatively, Pacifica agrees to issuance of a writ of mandate commanding that it prepare such an EIR and update its General Plan and each relevant mandatory element in compliance Government Code section 65300.
This letter and Petitioners' prior participation in Pacifica's administrative
process satisfy Petitioners' obligations under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, as interpreted by the California Supreme Court in Graham v. DaimlerChrysler (2004) 34 Cal.4th 553, 577.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
