NOTICE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL 1

1 To the Attorney General of the State of California:

2

3 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under the Public Resources Code Section

4 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388, that on

5 November 4, 2021, Rebecca (Becky) Steinbruner filed a petition

6 for writ of mandate against Soquel Creek Water District and the

7 Board of Directors for Soquel Creek Water District, with the

8 City of Santa Cruz as Real Party in Interest, in Santa Cruz

9 County Superior Court. The petition alleges that Soquel Creek

10 Water District and the Board of Directors for Soquel Creek Water

11 District violated the California Environmental Quality Act by

12 failing to provide adequate environmental analysis of the

13 Modified PureWater Soquel Project, the second time the project

14 has been significantly modified since the initial Project

15 Environmental Impact Report was certified.

16

17 The Modified PureWater Soquel Project will endanger multiple

18 aquatic habitats because the pressurized effluent in the eight

19 miles of conveyance pipelines crossing the San Lorenzo River and

20 other local streams will contain high levels of chloramine,

21 which is toxic to all aquatic life in the event of a pipe

22 rupture or leak. There are no mitigations for this danger in

23 the Project EIR or Modified Project Addendum.

24

25 The Modified PureWater Soquel Project will also impose unknown

26 risks to marine habitat in the Monterey Bay National Marine
27 Sanctuary by directly dumping of the Advanced Sewage Water

28 Treatment Facility concentrated brine from the reverse osmosis
and membrane filtration into the City of Santa Cruz Wastewater

NOTICE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL - 2

1 Treatment Facility effluent outfall pipeline. This concentrated

2 brine, would include toxic and potentially carcinogenic

3 disinfection by-products, in addition to the contaminants

4 removed from the treated sewage source water. The impacts of the

5 brine concentrate were not thoroughly evaluated in the initial

6 Project EIR, and the Project at the time stated the concentrated

7 brine would be returned to the Santa Cruz City Wastewater
8 Treatment Facility for further treatment and dilution.

9

10 Additionally, the quality of the sewage water supply source

11 has since been shown to have higher levels of total organic

12 carbon, ammonia and nitrite than was known at the time the

13 initial Project EIR was certified by the Board of Directors on

14 December 8, 2018. This has caused additional treatment
15 processes that are heavily chemical-dependent, but that were not

16 known at the time the initial EIR analysis was conducted, and

17 was not adequately analyzed in the Project Addendum 2020 or

18 Addendum 2021.

19

20 The City of Santa Cruz Wastewater Treatment Facility effluent

21 outfall pipeline has a known significant rupture approximately

22 65' from the shore of recreational beaches in Santa Cruz. The

23 Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board has taken

24 enforcement action regarding this issue, but the rupture has not

25 been repaired and there has no timeline by the City of Santa

26 Cruz to repair the rupture. The Modified Project Addendum makes

27 no mention of this potential near-shore contamination by the

28 Project brine concentrate.

NOTICE TO ATTORNEY GENERAL 3

1 Petitioner has exhausted all other remedies with the Soquel

2 Creek Water District and the Board of Directors for Soquel Creek

3 Water District, and is now compelled to take this action solely

4 for Public Benefit and environmental protection relief.

PETTTTON FOR WRTT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELTEF 1

2 REBECCA (BECKY) STEINBRUNER, Petitioner acting for Public

3 Benefit, alleges:

4 1. Petitioner, Rebecca (Becky) Steinbruner, is a long-time

5 resident of and property owner in Aptos, California, in

6
Santa Cruz County, with an extended history of involvement
7
in local water issues and a customer of a small privately- 8

9 owned water company. She has participated in nearly all

10 Soquel Creek Water District Board meetings, many City of

11 Santa Cruz Water Commission meetings, and many Santa Cruz
12 County Water Advisory Commission meetings since 2015, as
13
well as the Santa Cruz MidCounty Groundwater Sustainability 14

15 Agency meetings, and has actively submitted oral and

16 written comments to all agencies regarding, but not limited

17 to, water supply issues. She has legally opposed the

18 PureWater Soquel Project on behalf of the public benefit
19
and the environment since Respondents approved the Project 20

21 and certified the Project EIR in December, 2018.

22 2. Respondent, Soquel Creek Water District ("District") is a

23 Special District serving water to the MidCounty areas of

24 Aptos, Capitola, and La Selva Beach with supplies
25
predominantly dependent upon 16 groundwater wells. The
26

27 District has Appropriative Water Rights, and is legally

28 allowed to sell water only when there is a surplus. The

PETTTTON FOR WRTT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELTEF - 2

District Board of Directors declared a Groundwater State of

2 Emergency in June, 2014 when public outcry, primarily by

3
the Twin Lakes Baptist Church congregation, strongly
4

5 opposed the Board's proposed moratorium on new service

6 connections. The District has since continued to sell new

7 service connection agreements upon either water-saving

8 fixture replacements or payment of $55,000/AcreFoot new

water demand fees.
10

11 3. The Board of Directors for Soquel Creek Water District

12 ("Board") is an elected body of five representatives who

13 reside within District boundaries and are responsible for

14 approval of all projects and fiscal operations.
15
4. Respondents are the lead agency responsible under the
16

17 California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) for evaluating

18 the environmental impacts of the Project and Modified

19 Projects, however, under CCR 15162(c) Title 14, subsequent

20 impacts and changes should also be reviewed and approved by
21 the California Coastal Commission, as a Responsible Agency
22

23 and under the terms of the Consolidated Development Permit

24 3-20-0014 approved March 11, 2020.

25 5. California Dept. of Fish and Wildlife ("CDFW") is a Trustee

26 Agency for the Project and Modified Project, under CEQA

27
Guidelines Section 15386(a), and under 14 CCR 15206(b) (5)
28
is required to review the impacts of the Project and

PETTTTON FOR WRTT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELTEF 3

Modified Project, but has not submitted comment at any time

2 on the initial Project or Modified Project. Petitioner's

3
recent correspondence and Public Records Act request
4

5 responses with the CDFW clearly indicates that their staff

6 is not aware of the Project modifications and Respondents

7 have not applied for any necessary permits. (Attachment A)

8 6. The State Lands Commission is a Trustee Agency for this
9
Project under CEQA Section 15386(b)because the Modified
10

11 Project involves the San Lorenzo River bed, a navigable

12 waterway, and State school lands within 0.25 mile of the

13 Project.

14 7. The University of California is a Trustee Agency, under
15
CEQA Section 15386(d), for the Modified Project because it
16

17 involves and will affect the Natural Land and Water

18 Reserves System.

19 8 The City of Santa Cruz is a Real Party in Interest,

20 supplying all source treated sewage water, and partnering
21 with the District to benefit by the Project supplying 310
22

23 AcreFeet/year of recycled water for irrigation purposes at

24 Los Barrancos Park and possibly a bulk recycled water

25 station. The City of Santa Cruz has agreed to fund the

26 cost of constructing four miles of six-inch pipe from the
27 Modified Project Treatment Facility to the City of Santa
28
Cruz. Without this Modified Project, the City has no other

PETTTTON FOR WRTT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELTEF - 4

readily available source for recycled water, unless outside

2 agreements with the City of Scotts Valley are approved.
3
9. The Modified Project has undergone multiple significant
4

5 changes since the Board approved the first iteration of the

6 PureWater Soquel Project ("Project")on December 8, 2018 and

7 certified the Project EIR, entwined with a Statement of

8 Overriding Considerations and a Mitigation and Monitoring

9
Reporting Plan.
10

11 10. The Modified Project would treat 3.1 million gallons

12 daily of secondary treated sewage water, taken from the

13 City of Santa Cruz Wastewater Treatment Facility, conveyed

14 under pressure over four miles to the Advanced Water
15 Treatment Facility at 2501 Chanticleer Avenue in Live Oak,
16

17 treated further and then conveyed under pressure two miles

18 further to three Pressure Injection Well locations in Aptos

19 where the treated effluent would be injected at depths of

20 600 -1000' into the Purisima Aquifer. Rejected

21 contaminants and disinfection by-products ("brine") would
22

23 be conveyed under pressure back to Santa Cruz and dumped

24 directly into the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary

25 with the City's sewage effluent outfall.

26 11. Respondents have significantly changed the Project

27 multiple times as new information was known, but have not
28
conducted any Subsequent EIR analysis or associated 30-day

PETTTTON FOR WRTT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELTEF - 5

1 Public Comment Periods on any of these Project

2 modifications.

3
12. Respondents caused and approved significant
4

modifications as Addenda and listed as regular Board agenda

6 items (not as noticed public hearings) on November 17,
2020, March 18, 2021, May 17, 2021, and again on October 5,

8 2021.

9
13. On October 5, 2021, Respondents caused and approved
10

11 the Project modifications in Resolutions 21-25 to Adopt an

12 Addendum to the Previously Certified Environmental Impact

13 Report (EIR) Approving the Clarified Treatment Process and

14 Facility Layout Modifications and Resolution 21-26 to

15 Execute an Amended and Restated Design-Build Agreement
16

17 Treatment Facilities Project with Black and Veatch

18 Construction Inc. for Phase 2 and 3 Services and Approving

19 a Contract Amendment with Brown and Caldwell.

20 14. The 2021 Addendum continues the piece-mealing tactics,

21 and without substantial evidence, continues to refer to the
22

23 adequacy of the initial Project EIR with only cursory

24 analysis provided in the 2020 Addendum and now, the 2021

25 Addendum, despite new significant information and major

26 Project modifications that have tripled energy demand, the

27 subject of public resistance regarding the District's 2012
28

PETTTTON FOR WRTT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELTEF - 6

- desalination project and it's ultimate defeat and rejection

2 by the City of Santa Cruz.

15. Petitioner made oral and written comments on the 2021
4

5 Addendum and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted

6 in this petition.

7 16. Petitioner performed all conditions precedent to

8 filing this action by complying with the requirements of
9
Public Resources Code 21167.5 in mailing, via Certified
10
Mail, Notice of this action on October 29, 2021 and 11

12 includes that proof of service as an attachment.

13 17. Petitioner files this action in Santa Cruz County

14 Superior Court, which is the proper venue.

15
18. Petitioner alleges the following Causes of Action with
16

17 facts supporting Respondents have failed to proceed as

18 required by law and have demonstrated an abuse of

19 discretion:

20 19. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

21
Respondents violated 14 Cal. Code of Regs. 15206 (b) (5) by
22

23 failing to actively involve the California Dept of Fish and

24 Wildlife in developing meaningful and enforceable mitigations

25 for the Modified PureWater Soquel Project.

26 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

27

28

PETTTTON FOR WRTT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELTEF - 7

1 Respondents have violated Public Resources Code 21104.2 and 14

2 CCR 15002 (a) by failing to obtain written findings on the impact
3
of the Project or Modified Project regarding the impact of the

5 modifications on the continued existence of any endangered or

6 threatened species, notably involving and impacted by the

7 chloramine effluent in conveyance system at the San Lorenzo

8 River point of crossing, as well as other multiple stream
9
|crossings and aquatic habitats.
10

11

12 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

13 Respondents have violated California State Water Resources

14 Control Board Resolution 68-16 by failing to provide a Final
15 Anti-Degradation Analysis of the Modified Project, to protect
16

17 and preserve the high-quality waters of the State, including the

18 Purisima Aquifer and the waters of the Monterey Bay National

19 Marine Sanctuary. (Attachment B copy of Resolution 68-16) The

20 initial Project EIR relied upon a Draft Anti-Degradation

21 Analysis, but no FINAL analysis has been submitted.
22

23 The 2021 Addendum fails to address the significant and adverse

24 impacts of directly dumping the Modified Project treatment brine

25 and disinfection by-products directly into the Monterey Bay

26 National Marine Sanctuary via the City of Santa Cruz Wastewater

27 Treatment Facility effluent outfall pipe, as well as the
28
potential significant and adverse impacts of accidental

PETTTTON FOR WRTT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELTEF - 8

1 injection of contaminated water into the Purisima Aquifer due to

2 system malfunction or human error.
3

4

5 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

6 Respondents have violated California State Water Code 13050 (g)

7 and (h) and State Water Resources Control Board Resolution 68-16

8 and have shown an abuse of discretion by failing to analyze or

9 address the existence of a known rupture in the Santa Cruz City
10

11 |Wastewater Facility effluent outfall pipe that is leaking

12 leffluent into the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary 65'

13 from recreational and critical marine habitats and whose impacts

14 potentially would be exacerbated by the Project's additional

15
concentrated Advanced Treatment brine and disinfection by-
16

17 products of unknown quantity and contamination levels.

18

19 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

20 Respondents have violated Public Res. Code 21166 and 14 Cal Code
21 Regs 15162 by failing to conduct a Subsequent EIR analysis of
22

23 the Project modifications, or any alternatives to the

24 modifications, which have been caused by substantial changes in

25 the circumstances under which the Project is being undertaken,

26 and substantial new information of critical importance to the

27 Project that was not known and could not have been known at the
28
time the initial EIR was certified as complete.

PETTTTON FOR WRTT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELTEF 9

1 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 Respondents have shown an abuse of discretion by approving
Resolutions 21-25 and 21-26 without a noticed public hearing,
4

5 not as a noticed public hearing or with a 30-day public comment

6 period, violating CEQA's central purpose of promoting

7 consideration of the environmental consequences of public

8 decisions and encouraging public participation to the fullest
9

10 extent. (15002 (a) ) "Identify the ways that environmental damage can be

11 avoided or significantly reduced, prevent significant, avoidable damage to the

12 environment by requiring changes in projects through the use of alternatives
13

14 or mitigation measures when the governmental agency finds the changes to

15 be feasible, and to disclose to the public the reasons why a governmental

16 agency approved the project in the manner the agency chose if significant
17

18 I environmental effects are involved."(Section 15002(a)

19

20 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

21 Respondents have demonstrated an abuse of discretion and
22

23 violation of 14 CCR 15206 (b) (5) by failing to consult with

24 Trustee Agencies to develop effective and enforceable

25 mitigations for the Modified Project as is required.

26 //

27

28

PETTTTON FOR WRTT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELTEF 10

EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 Respondents have failed to consult with the California Coastal
3
Commission regarding the Modified Project and Subsequent EIR
4

5 necessity, and therefore violated 14 CCR 15162 (c).

6

7 NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION

8 Respondents failed to adequately analyze the aesthetic impacts

9
lof the new 60' tower (36" diameter at base, 18" diameter at
10

11 apex) at the Chanticleer Advanced Water Treatment Facility for

12 radio communication. This is a new element and was not known

13 for analysis at the time the initial Project EIR was certified.

14

15
TENTH CAUSE OF ACTION
16

17 Respondents failed to analyze potential radio communication

18 interference conflicts with the Santa Cruz County Office of

19 |Emergency Services and Santa Cruz County Sheriff Department,

20 which are located directly across Chanticleer Avenue from the

21
Modified Project's Advanced Water Treatment Facility and that
22

23 would transmit radio frequencies that could desensitize public

24 safety communication.

25

26 ELEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

27 || Respondents have demonstrated an abuse of discretion by failing
28
to include the new Highway One Pedestrian and Bicycle Overpass

PETTTTON FOR WRTT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELTEF - 11

in the Modified Project environmental analysis regarding the

2 Project's aesthetic and noise impacts to members of the public
3
who will use that Overpass and be subjected to the visual blight
4

5 of the modified Chanticleer Advanced Treatment Facility and to

6 the noise of the Reverse Osmosis pumps, whose degree of

7 structural shielding has been modified.

8

9
TWELFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
10

11 Respondents have failed to conduct adequate analysis, public

12 notice and public comment period regarding the fact that the

13 Modified Project will now require double the amount of energy as

14 was stated in the 2020 Addendum, and nearly triple the energy

15 demand analyzed in the initial Project EIR.
16

17

18 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

19 1. Petitioner prays the Court to require that Respondents

20 consult and actively collaborate with all Trustee Agencies,
21 which include CDFW, the State Lands Commission, the Regents
22

23 of the University of California, as well as the California

24 Coastal Commission, as a Responsible Agency, to conduct a

25 Subsequent EIR for any and all modifications in the

26 Modified Project, as approved October 5, 2021 as Addendum

27 2021 and develop effective and enforceable mitigations to
28
address any and all significant and adverse environmental

PETTTTON FOR WRTT OF MANDATE AND DECLARATORY RELTEF 12

1 impacts of the Modified Project construction and

2 operational phases.
3

4
2. Petitioner prays that the Court require Respondents to

6 conduct a Subsequent EIR and provide members of the public

7 and all agencies with a 30-day comment period.

8

3. Petitioner prays the Court to require Respondents to conduct and make public a FINAL
10
Anti-Degradation Analysis regarding the Modified Project's impacts on the high-quality

12 waters of the Purisma Aquifer and the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.

13

14 4. Petitioner prays the Court to require Respondents to delay

15 all construction components until such actions described
16
above are taken in full.
17

18

19 5. Petitioner prays the Court rule that any other action

20 appropriate to provide stewardship of the environment and

21 the public safety of the residents is protected and

22 preserved in perpetuity.

Project Title: Adoption of Resolution 21-25 to Adopt an Addendum to the Previously Certified Environmental Impact Report, Adoption of Resolution 21-26 to Execute an Amended and Restated Design-Build Agreement Treatment Facilities Project with Black and Veatch Construction Inc., Approval of Contract Amendment with Brown and Caldwell, All Related to Pure Water Soquel Project, and development of a reimbursement agreement with the City of Santa Cruz for the recycled water line and other construction work

Project Applicant: Soquel Creek Water District
Specific Project Location Identify street address and cross street or attach a map showing project site (preferably a USGS 15' or 7 :½' topographical map identified by quadrangle name): [2505 Chanticleer Avenue, Santa Cruz, CA 95062; 2455 Chanticleer Avenue, Santa Cruz, CA 95062; 110 California Street., Santa Cruz California;

General Project Location (City and/or County): City of Santa Cruz, unincorporated Santa Cruz County
Project Description:
On December 18, 2018, the Soquel Creek Water District (District) certified the Final Environmental Impact Report (EIR), adopted Findings of Fact (including a Statement of Overriding Considerations) and a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program (MMRP), and approved the Pure Water Soquel: Groundwater Replenishment and Seawater Intrusion Prevention Project (PWS or Project). The Project will supplement natural recharge of the Santa Cruz Mid-County Groundwater Basin with purified water, which will be produced from existing secondary effluent from the Santa Cruz Wastewater Treatment Facility (SC WWTF) and delivered to treatment facilities located in either the City of Santa Cruz or unincorporated Santa Cruz County. The EIR evaluated potential environmental impacts that could occur as a result of implementing the Project and/or alternatives and provided applicable mitigation to reduce the intensity of potential environmental impacts. The District determined that the Project would have significant and potentially significant impacts that cannot be mitigated to a level of less than significant, despite the imposition of
Notice of Determination 1 FORM "F"

mitigation measures.
Since certifying the EIR and approving the Project, the District adopted an Addendum on November 17, 2020 (*2020 Addendum"), with regard to minor revisions to the PWS Project. The Addendum determined that neither the Project modifications, nor any changes in circumstances surrounding the Project, result in any new significant impact, or substantially increase the severity of an impact identified in the 2018 PWS EIR. The Addendum further determined that no new mitigation is required beyond those measures in the adopted
MMRP.

2021 Addendum
A subsequent Addendum has been prepared with regard to further minor revisions to the Project ("2021 Addendum"). The 2021 Addendum evaluates design changes to the treatment facilities to consolidate all PWS
treatment systems at a single site
of a (Chanticleer) and the incorporation of an ozone pretreatment system in lieu nitrifying biological aerated filtration pretreatment system. Consolidation of treatment systems at a single site was analyzed in the previously certified EIR and environmental impacts based part of the approved Project, and as such, the on the 2021 design changes to the Project have been analyzed relative to the impacts disclosed in the previously certified EIR. The 2021 Addendum determined that the minor
modifications would not result in substantial changes to the previously certified EIR or 2020 Addendum because it would not involve new significant impacts, nor would it substantially increase the severity of an impact identified in the certified EIR.
Amendment to BCVI Design Build Agreement On March 3, 2020, the Board approved the Black and Veatch Construction Inc. (BCVI) Phase Design Build conduct preconstruction activities for contract agreement to design and the PWS treatment facilities. As part of the collaborative design progression, the District approved an amendment to its Design Build agreement with BCVI to address the construction, start-up and commissioning services, and warranty (Phases 2 and 3) for the Treatment Facilities Project. The primary elements of the scope of work include:
Construction of the source-water pump station and tertiary treatment facility (cloth filter-UV system) and associated infrastructure and appurtenances at the Santa Cruz Wastewater Treatment Facility
Construction of the advanced water purification facility (ozone pretreatment, membrane filtration- reverse osmosis-UV-AOP, and post-treatment) and associated infrastructure and appurtenances at the
Chanticleer Site
As part of the District's partnership with the City of Santa Cruz, a 6-inch recycled water line will be constructed at the SCWWTF funded by the City of Santa Cruz
Amendment to BC's Scope of Work
Brown and Caldwell (BC), as Program Manager for the PWS Program, assists the District with Program delivery oversight, technical support, and Owner's Advisory services. Tò continue with the program delivery and execution of the projects under the PWS Program, the District approved an
work to amendment to PC's scope of capture the additional level of effort required with the revised program schedule and updated staffing
support for the construction phase oversight. Key services under this amendment include: Providing Project Management (Lead) for the Treatment and SWIP Wells Projects
Providing Construction-phase Quality Assurance (field inspectors and QA Lead)

8. Memorandum Responding to September 21, 2021 Comments from Rebecca Steinbruner Regarding Agenda Item 7.3

Background and Purpose The Santa Cruz Mid-County Groundwater Basin has been declared by the State as one of 21 critically overdrafted basins in California and is mandated to be brought into sustainability by 2040. To help address this challenge, while also increasing the sustainability of its groundwater supply, the District is implementing an environmental groundwater replenishment and seawater intrusion program, known as the Pure Water Soquel (PWS) Program. The PWS Program will reduce the degree of overdraft conditions in the basin, protect against further saltwater intrusion into the groundwater basin, and promote beneficial reuse by reducing discharge of treated wastewater into the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.
Following the Board's direction to evaluate the feasibility and environmental impacts in 2015, the District conducted numerous technical studies, sought independent review by the National Water Research Institute, and conducted environmental analysis consistent with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) through an Environmental Impact Report (EIR). On December 18, 2018, the Board of Directors certified the EIR and approved the PWS Program.
The PWS Program, an environmental groundwater replenishment and seawater intrusion prevention
program, includes three primary components: (1) advanced water purification treatment, (2) conveyance infrastructure (Conveyance Infrastructure Project), and (3) seawater intrusion prevention (SWIP) injection wells to replenish the groundwater basin. Through the PWS Program, the District will produce up to 1,500 acre-feet of purified water per year.
On March 3, 2020, the Board approved the award of the Design-Build contract to Black and Veatch Construction Inc. (BVCI) for the Treatment Facilities Project Phase 1. The contract authorized design work, as well as preparation and submission of a guaranteed price for construction services, start-up
and commissioning, and warranty during Phase 2 and 3.

BVCI is a fully integrated design-build contractor that combines design expertise with a
water/wastewater industry focused procurement and construction arm. The BVCI team has worked on
nine California Title 22 advanced water treatment projects and understands our local water systems and facilities gained through a long-standing working relationship with the District.
Under Phase 1 of the Design-Build Agreement, BVCI has conducted exploratory investigations, provided design services, and subsequently submitted a guaranteed price proposal for Phases 2 and 3 services (construction, start-up and commissioning services, and warranty).

Environmental Review
A Project-level EIR for Pure Water Soquel was certified by the District's Board of Directors on December 18, 2018. Further CEQA analysis was performed with regard to minor revisions to the PWS Project pursuant to an Addendum that was adopted on November 17, 2020. A subsequent Addendum has been
prepared and presented as Attachment 1 with regard to further minor revisions to the PWS Project.

Based on continued design development, the 2021 Addendum evaluates design changes to the treatment facilities to consolidate all PWS treatment systems at a single site (Chanticleer) and a the incorporation of an ozone pretreatment system in lieu of a nitrifying biological aerated filtration pretreatment system. Consolidation of treatment systems at a single site was analyzed in the Certified EIR and part of the approved project. As such, the environmental impacts based on the 2021 design
changes to the Project have been analyzed relative to the impacts disclosed in the Certified 2018 PWS
EIR.

The site-specific environmental review of the treatment facility revisions, along with environmental review prepared for the Certified EIR and 2020 Addendum, support a finding that the PWS Project with the proposed minor revisions would not result in any new impacts not previously disclosed in the Certified EIR, as amended by the 2020 Addendum; nor would it result in a substantial increase in the
magnitude of any significant environmental impact previously identified. It is also noted that the Project would remain subject to the mitigation measures already approved by the District pursuant to the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program.
For these reasons, an addendum to the Certified EIR is sufficient to meet the requirements of CEQA Section 15164, and the 2021 Addendum need not be circulated for public review, but can be included in
or attached to the Certified EIR. This 2021 Addendum also serves as documentation that the proposed
minor PWS Project changes do not trigger any of the conditions in CEQA Guidelines Section 15162; therefore, a subsequent EIR is not required.
Value Engineering and Amended and Restated Design-Build Agreement and Amendment 3 with
Black and Veatch
The March 3, 2020 approval for BVCI Phase 1 activities were to design and conduct preconstruction activities of the Treatment Facilities Project. The Project is designed to produce up to 1.34 million gallons per day (mgd) or 1,500 acre-feet per year (afy) of purified water from the Advanced Water Purification Facility (AWPF) at the Chanticleer Site and up to an additional 0.3 mgd of Title 22 unrestricted non-potable recycled water from the Tertiary Treatment Facility (TTF) at the Santa Cruz Wastewater Treatment Facility (SCWWTF).

As part of the design progression, BVCI has been collaboratively working with the District and the City of Santa Cruz on the treatment elements and facility configurations at both sites (the Santa Cruz
Wastewater Treatment Facility and the Chanticleer site). This $2,316,247 effort included performing value engineering, design optimization and the effort to prepare design documents and develop a guaranteed price (see Attachment 2).

Scope: A draft Amended and Restated Design-Build Agreement with BVCI that addresses the construction, start-up and commissioning services, and warranty (Phases 2 and 3) for the Treatment Facilities Project is provided (see Attachment 3). The primary elements of the scope of work that BVCI shall perform during Phases 2 and 3 include, but are not limited to:
Construction of the source-water pump station and tertiary treatment facility (cloth filter-UV system) and associated infrastructure and appurtenances at the Santa Cruz Wastewater Treatment Facility
Construction the advanced water purification facility (ozone pretreatment, membrane filtration- reverse osmosis-UV-AOP, and post-treatment) and associated infrastructure and appurtenances at
the Chanticleer Site

As part of our partnership with the City of Santa Cruz, a 6-inch recycled water line will be constructed at the SCWWTF funded by the City of Santa Cruz.

A detailed scope of work is provided (see Attachment 4).
Following the construction, start-up, and commissioning of the Project, a 2-year Design-Builder Warranty shall commence on the date of Substantial Completion. The Design-Builder shall perform all required corrective work and shall be responsible for the cost of all labor, materials, equipment,
transport, installation, and re-testing required for the corrective work.
Budget: Through progressive design and cost estimate submissions, the Phase 2 & 3 costs for the Treatment Facilities Project submitted by BVCI is $87,022,827. As part of the cost development and negotiations, two independent cost evaluations have been performed during the design (Phase 1): a cost evaluation analysis by Brown and Caldwell (the District's Owner's Engineering Advisor and Program Management Team for PWS) and an independent cost estimate by Jacobs. Both independent cost evaluations found that the construction costs provided by BVCI were competitive based on quantities and production estimates. Staff concurs with the independent cost evaluations by Brown and Caldwell and Jacobs concluding the cost is appropriate.

During the initial development of Pure Water Soquel, a Basis of Design Report (BODR) was prepared in 2019, and the engineer's estimate by Brown and Caldwell for the treatment facilities project was calculated based on conceptual level of design (1-15% level of design, known as a Class IV estimate with -15% to +50% range of accuracy) with the upper range at $68 million (in 2022 US Dollars).
In early 2021, as the design progressed and more detailed construction scope of the various project elements became better defined, the District engaged in design optimization with BVCI that incorporated refinements to the treatment processes and also integrated value engineering related to project costs. The cost proposal by BVCI is higher than the previous engineer's estimate for the treatment facilities project and is attributed to several factors including, but not limited to: The 2019 BODR estimate for the treatment project did not include pump stations and yard piping
costs at the SCWWTF and the Chanticleer site (these project components were associated with the Pure Water Soquel Conveyance Infrastructure Project). The 2021 cost proposal by BVCI includes these components. In 2020, during the design development with BVCI, to address the water quality of the treated secondary effluent from the SCWWTF, a pre-treatment component prior to the MF-RO-UV/AOP purification process was identified to optimize the treatment. The 2021 cost proposal by BVCI includes ozone pre-treatment. In 2020-2021, there have been impacts related to supply-chain, market volatility in material prices, and skilled labor shortages due to the pandemic and other natural disasters. These types of COVID- 19 impacts are also being realized in other parts of California for construction projects, whether they

Board of Directors

are residential, commercial, or municipality projects. The 2021 cost proposal reflects market commodity pricing on materials such as steel, PVC, copper, brass, and lumber that have had unprecedented surges in cost escalations as well as increased diesel costs and reduced/limited transportation options which have impacted shipping and material deliveries. In 2020-2021, the treatment project design period lasted longer than the District had planned. With project costs increasing in late 2020 and early 2021 due to the pandemic conditions described above, and in addition to addressing the City's interest to reduce construction impacts and maximize space at the SCWWTF for future needs, the District conducted value engineering and design optimization into summer 2021. This extended Phase 1 (design efforts) into when Phase 2 (construction) 2 was supposed to occur. Thus, the project construction start is approximately 8 months later than previously anticipated, and the duration is longer with substantial completion expected in December 2023 which added additional inflation cost beyond what was included in the 2019 estimate.

Public Outreach and Community Information Public outreach is and will continue to be a priority during the construction of the Treatment Facilities Project and will be conducted primarily by District staff and Data Instincts in coordination with BVCI. The outreach team will be working on providing neighboring businesses and residents up-to-date information on the construction impacts and project schedule.
Support Services for Project Management, Technical Services, and Construction Oversight The District selected Brown and Caldwell (BC) as the Program Manager for the Pure Water Soquel (PWS) Program. In this role, BC is assisting the District with Program delivery oversight, technical support, and Owner's Advisory (OA) services.
To continue with the program delivery and execution of the projects under the Pure Water Soquel Program with the updated schedule, the District requested Brown and Caldwell (BC) to prepare this scope of work (SOW) amendment. This amendment captures the additional level of effort required with the revised program schedule and updated staffing support for the construction phase
oversight.

BC has been requested to plan for adequate staff resources and securing their availability / continuity through December 2023, by then the majority of the construction on the PWS Program, including the Treatment Project, is anticipated to be completed.

Key services requested under this amendment are included in Attachment 5 and summarized below:
Providing Project Management (Lead) for the Treatment and SWIP Wells Projects
Providing Construction-phase Quality Assurance (field inspectors and QA Lead)
O Two construction phase inspectors, one each for the Treatment and Conveyance Projects and a Construction Phase QA Lead - overseeing both projects.
Contracts and Technical Oversight for the two Design-Build contracts including advisory and guidance roles for the District team
Support for the long-term Operations contract development with the third-party Operator for the Advanced Water Purification Facility (AWPF) and the City of Santa Cruz On-going Program Management and Technical Advisory support including Permitting,
Engineering Review during construction and project records management.

BC's Program Management services shall be provided on an as-needed basis under an existing "time and materials" contract with not-to-exceed provision of $3,486,425. This allows project and construction management to be adaptable over the construction period. which provides District a lot
of control and flexibility.

Fiscal Impact
Execution of the Amended and Restated Design-Build Treatment Facilities Agreement with BVCI
services and the Amendment to the Brown and Caldwell Professional Services Agreement fit within the District's PWS Program budget. The District has received funding by way of two grant awards through California's Prop 1 Groundwater Program ($50M) and the Bureau of Reclamation's Title XVI WIIN Act Program (over $6M), as well as a low-interest loan from EPA's Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program up to $88.9M. In addition, the District has been selected and is working with the State on entering a low-interest loan through its Seawater Intrusion Control Loan Program for approximately $36M. Funds through these programs will collectively finance the Pure Water Soquel Program.

Staff Recommendation
Staff has greatly appreciated the continued efforts, coordination, and partnership with the City of
Santa Cruz staff from both the Water Department and the Public Works Department on the design and development of the Treatment Facilities Project. This Project not only serves as a critical component to combat seawater intrusion, critical overdraft of the groundwater basin, and meet the State's mandate of basin sustainability by 2040, it also displays important regional and collaborative
environmental stewardship to reduce ocean discharge and expand beneficial reuse in Santa Cruz County. Staff is also thankful for the solid collaboration and partnerships with Santa Cruz County Public Works and the Regional Transportation Commission (RTC) while we work together and create a nexus in the Live Oak area with 'green' projects at the Chanticleer site (co-location of the bike- pedestrian overcrossing and Pure Water Soquel's purified recycled water facility).

Staff recommends that following:
Authorize a purchase order to BVCI for the design optimization and value engineering in the amount of $2,316,247;
Adopt Resolution 21-25 (Attachment 6) to approve clarifications to the treatment processes and facility layout modifications and Resolution 21-26 (Attachment 7) to authorize the execution of the Amended and Restated Design-Build Agreement for the Treatment Facilities Project with

Resolution No. 21-25
Page 2 of 3
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the Board of Directors of the SOQUEL CREEK
WATER DISTRICT:

SECTION 1. The Board of Directors has reviewed and considered the information contained in
the Addendum, EIR, and all supporting documentation, copies of which are on file at the District's office and are incorporated by reference as though set forth fully herein. Based on this review, the District finds that the Addendum contains a complete, objective, and accurate reporting of the potential impacts of the modifications to the Project, and that these findings reflect the independent judgment and analysis of the District.

SECTION 2. The District finds that the Addendum has been completed in compliance with CEQA. The District further finds that any comments received regarding the clarifications to the Project have been examined and determined to not modify the significant conclusions of the EIR. The District further finds that no additional feasible mitigation measures within the District's authority are necessary to reduce the environmental impacts of the clarifications to the Project, because all impacts of the clarifications to the Project are either less than significant, will be mitigated to a level of less than significant through compliance with the existing mitigation, or remain significant and unavoidable even with the imposition all of feasible mitigation. Finally, based on the substantial evidence set forth in the record, including but not limited to the Addendum, the District finds that none of the conditions triggering the need for subsequent environmental review have occurred. Specifically, the District finds that no subsequent environmental review is required pursuant to
State CEQA Guidelines section 15162 because:

a. No substantial changes are proposed by the clarifications to the Project which will require major revisions of the EIR due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects;
b. No substantial changes have occurred with respect to the circumstances under which the clarifications to the Project are being undertaken which will require major revisions of the EIR due to the involvement of new significant, environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects; and

C. No new information of substantial importance, which was not known and could not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the EIR was certified, shows that: (i) either the clarifications to the Project will have one or more new significant effects; (ii) significant effects of clarifications to the Project examined in the EIR will be substantially more severe; (iii) mitigation measures or alternatives previously found not to be feasible would in fact be feasible and would substantially reduce one or more significant effects of the clarifications to the Project, but the District declined to adopt the measure or alternative; or (iv) mitigation measures or alternatives which are considerably different from those analyzed in the EIR would substantially reduce one or more significant effects on the environment of the clarifications to the Project, but the District declines to adopt the measure or alternative.

SECTION 3. The District hereby approves and adopts the Addendum to the EIR prepared for the Project, and confirms that all the mitigation measures previously imposed as part of the District's
December 18, 2018 approvals remain fully applicable to the clarifications to the Project.

SECTION 4. The District hereby approves the clarifications to the Project.

SECTION 5. The District directs staff to file a Notice of Determination with the County Clerk's Office within five (5) working days of adoption of this Resolution.

MEMORANDUM

To: Soquel Creek Water District Board of Directors

Dated: September 29, 2021
Re: Responses to September 21, 2021 Comments From Rebecca Steinbruner Regarding Agenda Item #7.3

Comment 1:
Ms. Steinbruner requests a public hearing on the Addendum and proposed approval of any revision to the PWS Project.

Response 1:
The District went above and beyond what is required by CEQA in preparing and considering this Addendum.
A public hearing regarding CEQA review is not mandatory simply because someone asks for one. Per CEQA Guidelines §15202, CEQA does not require : public hearing for the consideration of an addendum. Instead, public hearings are typically held only if required by a local ordinance, statute, regulation, or rule.
Further, CEQA does not mandate a specific procedure that the District needs to take to make a determination as to whether a subsequent or supplemental EIR is required for an approval action. Thus, the District has already exceeded what is required under CEQA by preparing a formal Addendum and agendizing it for Board consideration. Moreover, even if there is no public hearing on the Addendum, Ms. Steinbruner and other members of the public are welcome to comment on the Addendum during the general comment portion of the Board
meeting.

Comment 2:
Ms. Steinbruner expresses concern regarding the Board's reliance on the certified 2018 EIR, given the changes now proposed.

Response 2:
The District was unable to analyze the proposed minor revisions to the PWS Project at the time the District certified the EIR in 2018, because those minor changes were unknown in
2018.
The minor revisions to the PWS Project approved via the Addendum of November of 2020, and those considered today were not known at the time the Board certified the EIR in 2018. Thus it would have been speculative and improper to analyze in 2018 any impacts that were not then known.

Paae 497 of 513

ATTACHMENT 8 - ITEM 7.3

Moreover, under CEQA, there is a presumption against requiring any further environmental review once an EIR has been prepared for a project. (Pub. Resources Code §21166; CEQA Guidelines §15162.) Subsequent environmental review is allowed only when substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions of the EIR, substantial changes occur in the circumstances under which the project is being undertaken that will require major revisions in the EIR, or new information of substantial importance to the project that was not known and could not have been known at the time the EIR was certified as complete becomes available. The Addendum before the Board documents that none of these elements are present, and so no subsequent environmental review is required.

Comment 3:

Ms. Steinbruner requests that the District consult with the California Coastal Commission, and prepare a subsequent EIR to analyze the proposed modifications to the Project.
Response 3:
The California Coastal Commission does not need to review the Addendum.
CEQA Guidelines section 15162 requires a responsible agency to prepare a subsequent EIR only after the lead agency's approval and before any approval of a project is issued by the responsible agency, and only when events triggering the preparation of a subsequent EIR occur. Because the California Coastal Commission has already issued its approval related to the PWS Project pursuant to the certified EIR in March 2020, and because the currently proposed modifications proposed for the Project are minor and do not trigger the preparation of a subsequent EIR, the California Coastal Commission is not required to review or approve
the Addendum.

Comment 4:

Ms. Steinbruner appears to argue that, pursuant to the Friends of the College of San Mateo Gardens v. San Mateo County Community College (2016) 1 Cal.5th 937 case, the District must prepare a subsequent EIR instead of an Addendum due to the proposed changes to the
PWS Project.

Response 4:

Friends of the College of San Mateo Gardens v. San Mateo County Community College
(2016) 1 Cal.5th 937 does not require the District to conduct subsequent environmental
review of the minor modifications proposed to the PWS Project.
The main crux of the Supreme Court's San Mateo Gardens decision holds that CEQA does not authorize courts to invalidate an agency's action based solely on whether the court believes the modifications to the project is a new project or merely a modified version. In San Mateo Garden, a community college adopted an IS/MND to renovate certain buildings on its campus, but subsequently approved an addendum to later demolish, rather than renovate, those buildings. The Supreme Court found that it is within the agency's discretion to determine whether the previous environmental document retains relevance in light of any

Pade 498 of 513

ATTACHMENT 8 - ITEM 7.3

proposed changes, and if so, whether major revisions to the previous environmental document are required due to the involvement of any new, previously unstudied significant
environmental impacts.
As discussed in San Mateo Gardens, the District may proceed under CEQA's subsequent
review provisions as long as, in its discretion, it determines that the prior EIR is relevant to
the ongoing decision-making process and retains some informational value. (Friends of the
College of San Mateo Gardens v. San Mateo County Community College Dist. (2016) 1
Cal.5th 937, 952.) Under this test for the applicability of CEQA's subsequent review
provisions, if the agency determines, either impliedly or expressly, that the existing EIR is relevant and retains some informational value, its consideration of the proposed change to the project is subject to the subsequent review standards in Public Resources Code 821166 and CEQA Guidelines §15162. Here, the Board is considering minor modifications to the PWS Project, for which the EIR was specifically prepared. Thus, the EIR's relevance to the PWS Project is clear.

Comment 5:

Ms. Steinbruner appears to suggest that the "fair argument" standard of review applies to the District's evaluation of the evidence relating to the question of whether further environmental review of the PWS Project is required.

Response 5:

The fair argument standard of review does not apply here.

This is incorrect because, even under a generous reading of the decision, the standard of
review that applies depends on the nature of the original CEQA document. (Friends of the College of San Mateo Gardens v. San Mateo County Community College Dist. (2016) Cal.5th 937, 958.) Once an EIR has been certified for a project, the District may not require
a further EIR unless it finds, based on substantial evidence, that one of the three triggers for subsequent environmental review has occurred under Public Resources Code section 21166
and CEQA Guidelines section 15162. In San Mateo Gardens, the California Supreme Court
has confirmed that the fair argument standard of review only potentially applies where a negative declaration has originally been adopted for a project. Here, because the District certified the EIR, and not a negative declaration, for the PWS project, the substantial evidence standard would apply, not the fair argument standard.

Paae 499 of 513

ATTACHMENT 8 - ITEM 7.3

Comment 6:
Ms. Steinbruner believes that the District needs to prepare a subsequent EIR, instead of an Addendum, to analyze the minor project modifications.

Response 6:

A Subsequent EIR is not required because none of the triggers laid out in CEQA
Guidelines section 15162 have occurred.

CEQA Guidelines section 15162 allows a subsequent EIR only when substantial changes to the project will result in new significant environmental effects not discussed in the previous EIR, significant effects previously examined will be substantially more severe, or mitigation measures or alternatives which are considerably different from those analyzed in the previous EIR would substantially reduce significant effects but the project proponent declines to adopt them. There are no CEQA Guidelines $15162 circumstances here that trigger the need for a subsequent/supplemental EIR. Here, the Addendum before the Board summarizes the findings of the certified EIR, as amended by the 2020 Addendum; analyzes the minor changes to the Project; and summarizes the difference - if any - between the EIR, as amended by the2020 Addendum, and the minor changes to the Project. As analyzed in the Addendum before the Board, the minor changes to the Project consist primarily of pre- treatment design clarifications that will not have significant impacts that were previously not discussed in the certified EIR, not have significant effects that will be substantially more severe than previously disclosed in the certified EIR, or involve mitigation measures or alternatives that are now feasible and would reduce significant impacts

Comment 7:

Ms. Steinbruner seems to suggest that the significance thresholds in the certified EIR and Addendum were "arbitrarily" established to avoid significant impacts.
Response 7: The Addendum relies on the same significance thresholds established in the
previously certified EIR, all of which are supported by substantial evidence.
The District has discretion to formulate standards of significance for use in an EIR, which requires the agency to make a policy judgment distinguishing adverse impacts deemed significant from those deemed not significant. (King & Gardiner Farms, LLC v. County of Kern (2020) 45 Cal.App.5th 814, 884.) Selection of a threshold of significance "requires an exercise of reasoned judgment" founded on substantial evidence. (Mission Bay Alliance v. Office of Community Inv. & Infrastructure (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 160, 206.) The standards for significance used in an EIR can be based on a number of sources, including a determination by the lead agency (including reliance on the judgment of experts who prepared the EIR), policies adopted and implemented by the lead agency, and standards in the Appendix G checklist.
Here, the certified EIR used significance criteria based on Appendix G, with some minor modifications, where it was necessary to develop additional significance criteria to fully evaluate the specific impacts of the Project. (DEIR, p. 4.1-2.) The District properly exercised

Page 500 of 513

ATTACHMENT 8 - ITEM 7.3

its discretion in certifying the EIR and accepting the appropriateness of the significance standards used in the EIR. The Addendum before the Board relies on this same significance
criteria from the certified EIR in its analysis.

Comment 8:

Ms. Steinbruner submitted a number of passages from CEQA and CEQA Guidelines regarding lead agency tiering off of programmatic EIRs.
Response 8: Tiering off the previously certified EIR is inappropriate here as the EIR has already analyzed the PWS Proiect in its entirety, and a subsequent EIR is not necessary to
review the proposed minor modifications.
Tiering is appropriate when an EIR is prepared for a program, plan, policy, or ordinance. (Pub. Resources Code §21094(a); CEQA Guidelines §15152(d).) Tiering may also be used when an EIR is prepared for a specific action at an early stage, and a narrower EIR will be prepared at a later stage, which allows the agency to focus the EIR for the first stage of approval on the issues to be decided at that time. That is not the case here, where the PWS Project is not a program, plan, policy or ordinance. The certified EIR here was prepared for the totality of the PWS Project; thus, tiering would not be appropriate here

Cc: Becky Steinbruner
Subject: PLEASE PROPERLY NOTICE PROPOSED PUREWATER SOQUEL PROJECT MODIFICATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL
ANALYSIS CALENDARED FOR OCTOBER 5, 2021
Dear Soquel Creek Water District Board of Directors,
I write to respectfully ask that your Board agendize the item "PWS Phase 2 Treatment Contract & EIR Addendum" as a
public hearing item and provide public noticing associated.
On September 7, 2021, your Board approved the Board Calendar as Consent Agenda Item 4.2 (page 8) in the agenda packet. I verbally requested during public comment at the September 7, 2021 meeting that your Board place this item
on a the October 5, 2021 agenda as a public hearing item, to be noticed as such, and held in the very beginning of the
Board's meeting, for the benefit of the public. I received no response from the Board or staff. https://www.soquelcreekwater.org/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Agenda/09072021-261?packet=true This proposed Addendum will be the second such action taken by the District regarding the PureWater Soquel Project.
The first Addendum, approved by your Board on November 17, 2020, brought major modifications to the Project by adding a completely new nBAF treatment facility and process that will double the energy demand of the original Project,
cause multiple large storage tanks of hazardous chemicals to be used, stored and transported to the two treatment sites, both of which are within 0.25 mile of multiple schools which received no written notice of the changes, and will
increase the number of construction truck trips by nearly 1000. Your Board chose to rely on the Project's EIR, certified on December 8, 2018, long before any of the facts that compelled these major modifications were even known. I continue to hold that, in compliance with 14 CCR 15162, the
California Coastal Commission, as the agency taking subsequent discretionary action regarding the PureWater Soquel Project, should have consulted with the Soquel Creek Water District, as the lead agency of the Project, to determine
whether or not the major modifications to the Project met the threshold of Subsequent EIR requirements. CEQA Guidelines provide that a public hearing on a project's environmental impacts "should usually be held when the lead agency determines it would facilitate the purposes and goals of CEQA to do so." (14 Cal Code Regs 15202(c)).
Because your Board is composed of environmental scientists and industry professionals, you are all well aware that one of the primary goals of the CEQA process is to provide opportunity for informed public participation throughout a Project's process. However, if the public is not in good faith made aware of major modifications proposed, due to
inadequate or thorough public noticing, how can the public participate in a manner that is meaningful or transparent? When an agency considers whether to conduct subsequent environmental review after a Notice of Determination, courts apply the fair argument standard of review (Friends of the College of San Mateo Gardens v. San Mateo County Community College Dist. (2016) 1 Cal.5th 937, 959). An agency therefore is required to conduct subsequent review if a proposed modification may produce a significant environmental effect that was not studied in the previous Notice of
Determination.
Lead Agencies may not arbitrarily establish thresholds to either create or avoid significant impacts. Thresholds must be backed by substantial evidence, which is defined in the CEQA statute to mean "facts, reasonable assumptions predicated
on facts, and expert opinion supported by facts" (State CEQA Guidelines § 15064.7(b)). CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines allow for "staged" EIRs, which an agency may prepare for "complex or phased projects" where the agency does not know specific project details at the time of the first discretionary approval. The agency can then rely on the overarching analysis in the staged EIR and evaluate only project level details in a later review (CEQA Guidelines Section 15167[a]). The CEQA Guidelines are located at Title 14, Division 6, Chapter 3 of the California Code of
Regulations.

1

Paae 502 of 513

ATTACHMENT 8 - ITEM 7.3
The statute and the CEQA Guidelines provide a framework for agencies to tier from a "program" EIR prepared for a program, plan, policy, or ordinance (PRC Sections 21093, 21094; CEQA Guidelines Sections 15168, 15152). The program EIR will cover "general matters and environmental effects" for the overarching program, plan, policy, or ordinance, and the agency will prepare "narrower or site-specific [EIRs] which incorporate by reference the discussion" in the program
EIR (PRC Section 21068.5). Subsequent environmental review is environmental analysis prepared for a later discretionary approval after an agency has certified a prior EIR or adopted a ND2 (PRC Section 21166; CEQA Guidelines Section 15162). Prior to approving a later project based on program EIR, an agency must first determine whether the project is "within the scope" of the program EIR and whether it triggers the requirements for subsequent environmental review. Both determinations must be supported by substantial evidence. When a further discretionary approval is necessary, a subsequent or supplemental EIR is required only where the later
activity, which is within the scope of the program EIR, would have effects that were not examined in the program EIR
(CEQA Guidelines Section 15168[c][1]). The requirements for subsequent and supplemental review are limited in order to balance "CEQA's central purpose of promoting consideration of the environmental consequences of public decisions
with interests in finality and efficiency" (Friends of the College of San Mateo Gardens v. San Mateo County Community College Dist. [2016] 1 Cal.5th 937, 949). The agency must first determine, based on substantial evidence, whether the previous EIR retains some informational value (Friends of the College of San Mateo Gardens v. San Mateo County Community College Dist. [2016]1 Cal.5th 937, 949). When a program EIR or project-level EIR has been certified, a subsequent EIR is not required unless (PRC Section 21166;
CEQA Guidelines Section 15162): (1) "Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions" to the EIR "due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in
significant effects"; the severity of previously identified
(2) "Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances," and those changes will require "major revisions" to
the EIR "due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of
previously identified significant effects"; or (3) "New information of substantial importance, which was not known and could not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time" of preparation of the EIR, becomes available.
Such information must show either: a) the project will have one or more significant effects not discussed in the previous EIR; b) significant effects previously examined will be substantially more severe; c) mitigation measures or alternatives previously found to be infeasible would in fact be feasible and would substantially reduce one or more significant effects of the project, but the project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation
measure or alternative; or d) mitigation measures or alternatives which are considerably different from those analyzed in the previous EIR would
substantially reduce one or more significant effects on the environment, but the project proponents decline to adopt
the mitigation measure or alternative. If the conditions in either section (1), (2), or (3), above, are triggered, an agency
must prepare a subsequent environmental document. If that project-level detail resulted in new significant impacts, then a subsequent EIR could be a effective. The subsequent EIR would allow the agency to narrowly focus the subsequent analysis on the environmental impacts based on the newly available project detail. If the requirements for a subsequent EIR are triggered, but "[o]nly minor additions or changes would be necessary to make the previous EIR adequately apply to the project in the changed situation," an agency may decide to prepare a supplemental EIR rather than subsequent EIR (CEQA Guidelines Section 15163[a]). 4 Either type of EIR may conclude that there will be new significant unavoidable impacts, in which case the lead agency must adopt a statement of overriding considerations. If an agency is required under PRC Section 21166 and CEQA Guidelines Section 15162 to conduct subsequent environmental review under program EIR, the agency should proceed pursuant to PRC Section 21094 and CEQA Guidelines Section 15168 or 15152. The agency must prepare an initial study to consider whether the later project may cause significant effects that were not examined in the program EIR (PRC Section 21093[c]).
The court does not place importance on the title of the EIR, but rather focuses on whether the level of analysis is commensurate with the detail of the project. The subsequent EIR and the supplemental EIR are identical in processing in that both require public circulation of the draft document, response to comments, etc.

ATTACHMENT 8 - ITEM 7.3
Where they differ is in the magnitude of change between the project evaluated in the certified EIR and the one being proposed. If major changes to the original project description are required that would create more of an impact on the
environment, then a subsequent EIR is appropriate. If new information is all that is needed to allow the newly proposed
project to use the existing certified EIR, then a supplement to the original document would suffice. Both subsequent and supplemental EIRs must comply with the same requirements for notice and public review as for a draft EIR (CEQA Guidelines Sections 15162[d], 15163[c]). Response to public comments and a new final EIR, findings
of fact, and if necessary a statement of overriding considerations would be required.
Friends of the College of San Mateo Gardens v. San Mateo County Community College Dist. (2016) 1 Cal.5th 937: When there is a change in plans, circumstances, or available information after an agency initially approves a project, a the agency must determine, based on substantial evidence, whether the original environmental document retains some
informational value. Where it does, CEQA's subsequent review provisions apply. Where an agency relies on a prior EIR, the substantial evidence standard of review applies to the agency's determination not to conduct further review. Where an agency relies on a prior ND, the fair argument standard of review applies. Lead Agencies may not arbitrarily establish thresholds to either create or avoid significant impacts. Thresholds must be backed by substantial evidence, which is defined in the CEQA statute to mean "facts, reasonable assumptions
predicated on facts, and expert opinion supported by facts" (State CEQA Guidelines § 15064.7(b)). There is no mention of "thresholds of significance" in the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA regulations, although changes adopted in 2020 include a new "thresholds" section incorporating several factors for agencies to
consider when determining "whether NEPA applies or is otherwise fulfilled." (40 C.F.R. § 1501.1.) The changes also
specify that, in considering whether the effects of the proposed action are significant, agencies shall analyze the
potentially affected environment and the degree of the effects of the action. (40 C.F.R. § 1501.3.) https://ceqaportal.org/tp/Subsequent%20and%20Supplemental%20EIRs%20and%20Streamlining%207.23.21_ final5.pdf
In conclusion, I again respectfully request that the Soquel Creek Water District Board and staff publicly discuss as a public hearing item whether or not the proposed PureWater Soquel Project Phase 2 Treatment Contract and EIR Addendum meets the CEQA thresholds of a Subsequent EIR or Supplemental EIR and provide necessary public comment
period and findings. The magnitude of the proposed modifications that are compelling the District to seek an EIR Addendum on October 5 are unknown at this time to the public. However, I am hereby providing the District notice that if the modifications cause significant environmental impacts and the District chooses to avoid public hearing and a 30-day noticed public comment
period, I will pursue legal challenge.
Please acknowledge receipt of this message. Thank you.
Sincerely,
Becky Steinbruner

Ms. Steinbruner,

To date CDFW has not received a permit application (notification per FGC 1602) for work related to this project. If work may require a CDFW permit such as riparian vegetation removal, it would be at the risk of the entity conducting the work if the permit process is not followed. Additionally, CDFW has not received an incidental take permit application for this project.

Dear Mr. Stanley, Mr. Stokes, and Ms. Stumpf,
I have not received any response from you regarding my concerns that there appears to be no oversight or collaboration by California Dept. of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) with Soquel Creek Water District or their contract agents for the Modified PureWater Soquel Project.

On August 17, 2021, I submitted a Public Records Act request to CDFW for correspondence with Soquel Creek Water District and/or the City of Santa Cruz regarding the Project. I am alarmed by the CDFW response of August 30, 2021 that "No Records Exist".

I am very troubled that no one appears to be collaborating with these public agencies to ensure the Modified PureWater Soquel Project conveyance system will have adequate and enforceable mitigations to safeguard the San Lorenzo River and other riparian habitats that will be disturbed in construction and subject to the possiblity of toxic chloramine effluent leaks in seismic and other natural and manmade disaster events.

Please confirm there have been no applications for Incidental Take Permits for this Modified Project. This morning, I attempted to telephone that CESA office, using the options available on the CDFW audio menu, but the recording said the number has been disconnected.

Also, according to the CDFW website, Soquel Creek Water District would be required to obtain an Incidental Take Permit for the Modified PureWater Soquel Project conveyance element because of the multiple stream crossings involved:

Incidental Take Permits
Incidental Take Permits allow a permittee to take a CESA-listed species if such taking is incidental to, and not the purpose of, carrying out an otherwise lawful activity. These permits are most commonly issued for construction, utility, transportation, and other infrastructure-related projects. Permittees must implement species-specific minimization and avoidance measures, and fully mitigate the impacts of the project. (Fish & G. Code § 2081 (b); Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §§ 783.2-783.8)

Dear Mr. Stokes, Mr. Stanley and Ms. Stumpf, Thank you, Mr. Stanley, for taking time to talk with me this morning about my concerns.
Can you please determine whether the Incidental Take Permit that I believe was issued for the PureWater Soquel Project was issued before November 17, 2020? That was the date the Soquel Creek Water District
Board approved the Addendum for the Modified Project.
If the Permit were issued before that date, the concern regarding the toxic chloramine effluent would not have
been addressed because that is one of the impacts associated with the significant Project modifications.
Also, I would greatly appreciate any information you can provide regarding whether or not the Soquel Creek Water District staff or their contractors are collaborating with your agency to develop meaningful and enforceable mitigations for the Project's MMRP, as is required by CEQA law.

Thank you.

Sincerely,
Becky Steinbruner

Dear Mr. Stokes and Ms. Stumpf, I have received no further correspondence from you to update me regarding the status of CDFW collaboration with Soquel Creek Water District to ensure there are adequate, effective and enforceable mitigations for the multiple adverse impacts of the Modified PureWater Soquel Project.
What is the status of your review of the information sent you on July 19, to which you replied on July 21
with acknowledgement?
Has CDFW contacted Soquel Creek Water Disrict project managers to develop mitigations to protect the environment, notably the riparian habitats where the pressurized conveyance system containing chloramine- laden effluent will cross multiple streams and waterways, such as the San Lorenzo River?
The Modified PureWater Soquel Project is well underway, and yet members of the public have no verification at all that there are or will be meaningful and enforceable mitigations to address adverse environmental impacts inherent.
This erodes the public's confidence in the California Dept. of Fish and Wildlife to uphold CEQA requirements Public Resources Code 21061, 21100(b)(3) and 14 California Code Regs 15126.4 and 15370.

Dear Mr. Stokes,
Thank you for your response. I am very concerned that Soquel Creek Water District has not been consulting CDFW to develop effective and enforceable Mitigation and Monitoring Plan, as the public was assured of when the District certified the Project EIR in 2018.

Under CEQA, a project that affects the habitat of an endangered, rare or threatened species is considered to be a project of statewide significance that requires state agency review of the project's EIR (14 Cal Code Regs 15206(b)(5). The lead agency is required to consult with the Department of Fish and Wildlife and obtain written findings on the impact of the project on the continued existence of any endangered or threatened speices, in compliance with Public Resources Code 21104.2. This has not happened.

The PureWater Soquel Project Final EIR refers to CDFW Code 1601 relating to public projects and
CDFW oversight on page 242:
https://www.soquelcreekwater.org/DocumentCenter/View/389/Draft-EIR-PDF?bidld=

Project mitigations 4.4.1h on page 30 of the EIR describe the procedure that involves collaboration with CDFW to develop a Mitigation and Monitoring Plan.

Maps of Habitats Affected are shown in the EIR on pages 210-218, including Jurisdictional Waters.

Pages 224-229 describe a total of 17 State Special Status Species of Concern and federal and State listed or proposed for listing species. Page 231 admits that these species are highly likely to be found in the Project's conveyance system areas.

On pages 33-34, the document describes the Mitigation 4.4.1l and 4.4.2a to address significant riparian habitat damage during the construction phase of the Project.

Note that none of these mitigations addresses the operational adverse impacts if there are leaks in the in Modified Project conveyance system, which will now add the nBAF treatment plant and multiple large above-ground storage tanks of hazardous chemicals adjacent to Neary Lagoon and the inherent addition of chloramine to the four-mile long pressurized conveyance pipeline to Live Oak. Chloramine is toxic to all aquatic life.

These significant Project modifications were approved by the Soquel Creek Water District Board on November 18, 2020 with only vague Addendum analysis, not a Subsequent EIR and public comment period as would be merited under CEQA.

https://www.soquelcreekwater.org/DocumentCenter/View/392/EIR-Addendum-PDF?bidld=
You will find cursory biotic analysis on pages 32-34 but that fails to discuss the Modified Project changes to the effluent related to the new nBAF treatment facility and potential adverse impacts to sensitive areas of biotic concern, notably riparian areas.

Please consider these significant and potentially adverse environmental impacts and the fact that Soquel Creek Water District has not consulted with CDFW to develop a meaningful, effective and enforceable Mitigation and Monitoring Plan for the Modified PureWater Soquel Project. I ask that your agency contact the District immediately to establish a collaborative process that will satisfy CEQA and CDFW Code requirements while ensuring the public that the environment is indeed being protected.

Please acknowledge your receipt of this message and let me know if you wish further information.
Thank you very much.

Mr. Steinbruner,

Thank you for brining your concerns to our attention. Here is the status as I understand, I'm cc'ing Monica Oey who used to cover Santa Cruz projects if I am missing anything:

To date CDFW has not received a permit application (notification per FGC 1602) for work related to this project. If work may require a CDFW permit such as riparian vegetation removal, it would be at the risk of the entity conducting the work if the permit process is not followed. My understanding is CDFW staff provided this information verbally to the project representatives via past phone communication.

In terms of CEQA, it would be helpful if you are able to reference a specific EIR measure number for us to review further. Assuming CDFW is to be consulted per the CEQA measure on the need of a permit for work affecting a stream, conceptually a call to staff in the past as described above may satisfy the word "consult." That said, if you have documentation pertaining to riparian vegetation removal or other work related to the project concerning stream alterations or pollution, please feel welcome to share it with us.

Thank you for your patience in our response-

Dear Mr. Stokes and Ms. Stumpf,
Thank you, Mr. Stokes, for taking time to talk with me this morning by telephone to review the Soquel Creek Water District's Modified PureWater Soquel Project in Santa Cruz County. I appreciate that you have been under-staffed and am happy to know that Ms. Stumpf is now working with CEQA review issues in Santa Cruz County.

As stated this morning, I am concerned that the PureWater Soquel Project EIR, certified in 2018, had no comment from State Fish and Wildlife included. The Project mitigations relative to stream crossings and riparian habitat destruction (takings) merely stated that Soquel Creek Water District would consult with State Dept. of Fish and Wildlife to develop enforceable mitigations. This is required by CEQA law.

However, it seems that to date, the District may not have contacted your office to develop those mitigations, despite the Project conveyance system element construction moving forward.

Has Soquel Creek Water District staff or their conveyance system contractor, Garney Pacific, Inc. or engineering contractor Kennedy/Jenks, Inc. contacted you or other staff of the California Dept. of Fish and Wildlife to develop enforceable Modified Project mitigations?

The District's Board approved significant modifications to the Project conveyance element on March 16, 2021, agenda item 7.3 (see agenda packet page 31):
https://www.soquelcreekwater.org/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Agenda/_03162021-237?packet=true

The Exhibits were not included in the Board packet for public review at that time, but are listed. Exhibit #13 Mitigation Monitoring Plan (see agenda packet page 38).

The contact information for the Project conveyance element team is shown on agenda packet page 35.

Dear Soquel Creek Water District Board of Directors, I write to respectfully ask that your Board agendize the item "PWS Phase 2 Treatment Contract & EIR Addendum" as a public hearing item and provide public noticing associated.
On September 7, 2021, your Board approved the Board Calendar as Consent Agenda Item 4.2 (page 8) in the agenda packet. I verbally requested during public comment at the September 7, 2021 meeting that your Board place this item on a the October 5, 2021 agenda as a public hearing item, to be noticed as such, and held in the very beginning of the Board's meeting, for the benefit of the public. received no response from the Board or
staff. https://www.soquelcreekwater.org/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Agenda/_09072021-261?
packet=true

This proposed Addendum will be the second such action taken by the District regarding the PureWater Soquel Project. The first Addendum, approved by your Board on November 17, 2020, brought major modifications to the Project by adding a completely new nBAF treatment facility
and process that will double the energy demand of the original Project, cause multiple large
storage tanks of hazardous chemicals to be used, stored and transported to the two treatment sites, both of which are within 0.25 mile of multiple schools which received no written notice of the changes, and will increase the number of construction truck trips by nearly 1000.
Your Board chose to rely on the Project's EIR, certified on December 8, 2018, long before
any of the facts that compelled these major modifications were even known. I continue to hold that, in compliance with 14 CCR 15162, the California Coastal Commission, as the agency taking subsequent discretionary action regarding the PureWater Soquel Project, should have consulted with the Soquel Creek Water District, as the lead agency of the Project, to determine whether or not the major modifications to the Project met the threshold of Subsequent EIR
requirements.

CEQA Guidelines provide that a a public hearing on a project's environmental impacts "should usually be held when the lead agency determines it would facilitate the purposes and goals of CEQA to do SO." (14 Cal Code Regs 15202(c)).
Because your Board is composed of environmental scientists and industry professionals, you are all well aware that one of the primary goals of the CEQA process is to provide opportunity for informed public participation throughout a Project's process. However, if the public is not in good faith made aware of major modifications proposed, due to inadequate or thorough public noticing, how can the public participate in a manner that is meaningful or transparent?

11/4/2021 Yahoo Mail PLEASE PROPERLY NOTICE PROPOSED PUREWATER SOQUEL PROJECT MODIFICATIONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL...

When an agency considers whether to conduct subsequent environmental review after a Notice of Determination, courts apply the fair argument standard of review (Friends of the College of San Mateo Gardens v. San Mateo County Community College Dist. (2016) 1 Cal.5th 937, 959). An agency therefore is required to conduct subsequent review if a proposed modification may produce a significant environmental effect that was not studied in the previous Notice of Determination.

Lead Agencies may not arbitrarily establish thresholds to either create or avoid significant impacts. Thresholds must be backed by substantial evidence, which is defined in the CEQA
statute to mean "facts, reasonable assumptions predicated on facts, and expert opinion supported
by facts" (State CEQA Guidelines § 15064.7(b)).

CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines allow for "staged" EIRs, which an agency may prepare for "complex or phased projects" where the agency does not know specific project details at the time of the first discretionary approval. The agency can then rely on the overarching analysis in the staged EIR and evaluate only project level details in a later review (CEQA Guidelines Section 15167[a]). The CEQA Guidelines are located at Title 14, Division 6, Chapter 3 of the California Code of Regulations.
The statute and the CEQA Guidelines provide a framework for agencies to tier from a "program" EIR prepared for a program, plan, policy, or ordinance (PRC Sections 21093, 21094; CEQA Guidelines Sections 15168, 15152). The program EIR will cover "general matters and environmental effects" for the overarching program, plan, policy, or ordinance, and the agency will prepare "narrower or site-specific [EIRs] which incorporate by reference the discussion" in the program EIR (PRC Section 21068.5).
Subsequent environmental review is environmental analysis prepared for a later discretionary approval after an agency has certified a prior EIR or adopted a ND2 (PRC Section 21166; CEQA Guidelines Section 15162). Prior to approving a later project based on a program EIR, an agency must first determine whether the project is "within the scope" of the program EIR and whether it triggers the requirements for subsequent environmental review. Both determinations must be supported by substantial evidence.

When a further discretionary approval is necessary, a subsequent or supplemental EIR is required only where the later activity, which is within the scope of the program EIR, would have effects that were not examined in the program EIR (CEQA Guidelines Section 15168[c][1]). The requirements for subsequent and supplemental review are limited in order to balance "CEQA's central purpose of promoting consideration of the environmental consequences of public decisions with interests in finality and efficiency" (Friends of the College of San Mateo Gardens v. San Mateo County Community College Dist. [2016] 1 Cal.5th 937, 949). The agency must first determine, based on substantial evidence, whether the previous EIR retains some informational value (Friends of the College of San Mateo Gardens v. San Mateo County Community College Dist. [2016] 1 Cal.5th 937, 949).

When a program EIR or project-level EIR has been certified, a subsequent EIR is not required unless (PRC Section 21166; CEQA Guidelines Section 15162): (1) "Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions" to the EIR "due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects";

2/4

(2) "Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances," and those changes will require "major revisions" to the EIR "due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects"; or
(3) "New information of substantial importance, which was not known and could not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time" of preparation of the EIR, becomes available.

Such information must show either:
a) the project will have one or more significant effects not discussed in the previous EIR;

b) significant effects previously examined will be substantially more severe;

c) mitigation measures or alternatives previously found to be infeasible would in fact be feasible
and would substantially reduce one or more significant effects of the project, but the project
proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative; or
d) mitigation measures or alternatives which are considerably different from those analyzed in the previous EIR would substantially reduce one or more significant effects on the environment, but the project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative. If the conditions in either section (1), (2), or (3), above, are triggered, an agency must prepare a subsequent environmental document.

If that project-level detail resulted in new significant impacts, then a subsequent EIR could be effective. The subsequent EIR would allow the agency to narrowly focus the subsequent analysis on the environmental impacts based on the newly available project detail. If the requirements for a subsequent EIR are triggered, but "[o]nly minor additions or changes would be necessary to make the previous EIR adequately apply to the project in the changed situation," an agency may decide to prepare a supplemental EIR rather than a subsequent EIR (CEQA Guidelines Section 15163[a]). 4 Either type of EIR may conclude that there will be new significant unavoidable impacts, in which case the lead agency must adopt a statement of overriding considerations.

If an agency is required under PRC Section 21166 and CEQA Guidelines Section 15162 to
conduct subsequent environmental review under a program EIR, the agency should proceed pursuant to PRC Section 21094 and CEQA Guidelines Section 15168 or 15152. The agency must
prepare an initial study to consider whether the later project may cause significant effects that were not examined in the program EIR (PRC Section 21093[c]).
The court does not place importance on the title of the EIR, but rather focuses on whether the level of analysis is commensurate with the detail of the project. The subsequent EIR and the supplemental EIR are identical in processing in that both require public circulation of the draft document, response to comments, etc.
Where they differ is in the magnitude of change between the project evaluated in the certified EIR and the one being proposed. If major changes to the original project description are required that would create more of an impact on the environment, then a subsequent EIR is appropriate. If new information is all that is needed to allow the newly proposed project to use the existing certified EIR, then a supplement to the original document would suffice.
Both subsequent and supplemental EIRs must comply with the same requirements for notice and public review as for a draft EIR (CEQA Guidelines Sections 15162[d], 15163[c]).

Response to public comments and a new final EIR, findings of fact, and if necessary a statement of overriding considerations would be required.
Friends of the College of San Mateo Gardens V. San Mateo County Community College Dist. (2016) 1 Cal.5th 937: When there is a change in plans, circumstances, or available information after an agency initially approves a project, the agency must determine, based on substantial evidence, whether the original environmental document retains some informational value. Where it does, CEQA's subsequent review provisions apply. Where an agency relies on a prior EIR, the substantial evidence standard of review applies to the agency's determination not to conduct further review. Where an agency relies on a prior ND, the fair argument standard of review applies.
Lead Agencies may not arbitrarily establish thresholds to either create or avoid significant impacts. Thresholds must be backed by substantial evidence, which is defined in the CEQA statute to mean "facts, reasonable assumptions predicated on facts, and expert opinion supported by facts" (State CEQA Guidelines § 15064.7(b)).
There is no mention of "thresholds of significance" in the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) NEPA regulations, although changes adopted in a 2020 include a new "thresholds" section incorporating several factors for agencies to consider when determining "whether NEPA applies or is otherwise fulfilled." (40 C.F.R. § 1501.1.) The changes also specify that, in considering whether the effects of the proposed action are significant, agencies shall analyze the potentially affected environment and the degree of the effects of the action. (40 C.F.R. § 1501.3.)

In conclusion, again respectfully request that the Soquel Creek Water District Board and staff publicly discuss as a public hearing item whether or not the proposed PureWater Soquel Project Phase 2 Treatment Contract and EIR Addendum meets the CEQA thresholds of a Subsequent EIR or Supplemental EIR and provide necessary public comment period and findings.
The magnitude of the proposed modifications that are compelling the District to seek an EIR Addendum on October 5 are unknown at this time to the public. However, I am hereby providing the District notice that if the modifications cause significant environmental impacts and the District chooses to avoid public hearing and a 30-day noticed public comment period, I will pursue legal
challenge.

Please acknowledge receipt of this message. Thank you.

Sincerely,
Becky Steinbruner

Dear Board, Please provide the information below, as the 2021 Addendum does not provide the information.

Please confirm that no chloramine will be in the effluent or R/O brine now that the nBAF treatment has been eliminated from the Santa Cruz Treatment Facility.
Please discuss and confirm the change in chemicals that will now be used and stored on-site at the Chanticleer and Santa Cruz City Facility.
How will these increases in construction and operation costs affect the cost/AcreFoot of the Indirect Potable Reuse water the District intends to sell to customers?
Please provide the energy calculations to support the claims regarding the significant energy demand that fails to address community conflict re: the Desal Project in the past.
Again, I reserve the right to file legal challenge within 30 days to address these issues.
Thank you.
Sincerely,

2020 Study Showing Reverse Osmosis Concentrate Has High Contamination Levels

Dear Soquel Creek Water District Board and Staff, Here is the link to the study spoke about during Public Comment (Item #5.0) at your October 19, 2021 Board meeting regarding the Reverse Osmosis Concentrate contamination levels in a study conducted in the San Francisco Bay area:
Reverse Osmosis Concentrate Treatment Research Results and Context for San Francisco Bay Prepared by: University of California Berkeley Stanford University
San Francisco Estuary Institute April 21, 2020

https://www.valleywater.org/sites/default/files/ROC_TechMemo_ETC_Research_0.pdf
It is applicable because your District currently intends to deposit the Modified PureWater Soquel Project Reverse Osmosis Concentrate directly into the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary via the Santa Cruz City Wastewater Treatment Facility effluent outfall pipe. As I have notified your Board earlier, that outfall pipe is ruptured 65' offshore, causing a plume of effluent close. to recreational and critical marine habitat.

I hope that you will take time to read this important information.

Sincerely,
Becky Steinbruner
