1 Petitioners and Plaintiffs Madera Irrigation District ("MID") and Madera Irrigation
2 District Groundwater Sustainability Agency ("MID GSA") (collectively, "Petitioners") hereby submit

- - 3 their Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief (the

4 "Petition"), stating claims against Respondents and Defendants Madera County Groundwater
5 Sustainability Agency ("Madera County GSA" or "County GSA"), Madera County Board of

6

7 Supervisors, and the County of Madera (collectively, "Respondents"), as set forth below.
I.

8 INTRODUCTION

9 1. After decades of prolonged overdraft throughout the state of California, the Legislature
10 enacted the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of 2014, Water Code section 10720 et seq.

11 ("SGMA"). SGMA requires local agencies, known as groundwater sustainability agencies ("GSAs"),
12 to adopt groundwater sustainability plans ("GSPs") specifying the measures the GSA will take to
13 mitigate overdraft, eliminate undesirable results, and achieve sustainability by 2040. The GSAs must
14 then implement those measures as set forth in the GSP,

15 2. This action concerns the Madera Subbasin Joint Groundwater Sustainability Plan ("Joint
16 GSP" or "Plan"), which was adopted after years of development by the MID GSA, the Madera County
17 GSA, and other GSAs in January 2020. The Madera Subbasin, located entirely within Madera County,
18| has been determined by the Department of Water Resources ("DWR") to be in a critical state. a Within
19 the jurisdictional boundaries of the Madera County GSA, most, if not all, irrigated lands lack a reliable

20

21 surface water supply to offset groundwater use, which has contributed significantly to overdraft
conditions.

22 3. The Joint GSP calls for Respondents to implement a suite of activities, including, inter
23 alia, a demand management program that would--together with other planned actions-produce a net
24 benefit sufficient to bring the Madera Subbasin into balance by 2040.

25 4,

26 Specifically, in the Joint GSP, Respondents determnined they would achieve sustainability
through the implementation of demand reduction program and the installation of infrastructure to
27 recharge the aquifer. The demand reduction component contemplated that, based on overdraft figures

28 as of the Plan's adoption, landowners within the Madera County GSA would be allowed to use 90,000

{7327/027/01351595.DOCX) VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- acre-feet per year ("afy") above the sustainable yield (i.e., the amount of groundwater that can be used
2 each year without diminishing supplies in the aquifer), which could be increased if Respondents
3 constructed and implemented recharge projects. This amount would then be reduced each year through

4

5 2040, at which time use above the sustainable yield would no longer be permitted.

5. Using more than the sustainable yield constitutes overdraft, which reduces groundwater
6 supplies and causes undesirable results. As such, Petitioners were skeptical about including demand
7 reduction in the Joint GSP. However, because the Plan contemplated that overdraft would be limited to
8 90,000 afy, and that amount would be reduced by 2-6% per year until reaching zero in 2040, Petitioners

9 accepted the proposal and agreed to approve the Joint GSP.

10 6. After the Joint GSP was adopted, however, irrigators in the Madera County GSA
11 escalated their groundwater use beyond that stated in the Joint GSP. And, to make matters worse, the
12 Madera County GSA was slow to develop and implement its demand reduction program. As a result,
13 when the Madera County GSA finally approved a framework for the program in August of 2021-
14 nearly two years after it was supposed to be implemented under the Joint GSP.-groundwater demand
15 had increased significantly.

16 7. Rather than making the difficult decision to curb the increased overdraft, Respondents
17 instead adopted a demand management program that actually increased the amount of overdraft
18  landowners could withdraw, increasing the baseline from 90,000 afy to 113,000 afy. This decision
19 authorized landowners within the Madera County GSA to increase overdraft by an additional 321,200
20 af through 2040-30% more than the amount contemplated in the Joint GSP.

21 8. In adopting this program, Respondents acted contrary to the law. Respondents violated
22 SGMA and Respondents acted arbitrarily and capriciously by adopting a demand management program
23 contrary to its own GSP. Respondents also failed to assess the environmental effects associated with
24 additional overdraft, including increased subsidence, water quality impacts, and a decline in water
25 availability associated with wells going dry, contrary to Respondents' obligations under the California
26 Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"). Additionally,

27

28 Respondents violated the California Constitution by engaging in an unreasonable use of water through

20 A. GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

21 24, The Sustainable Groundwater Management Act
In September 2014, after years of prolonged overdraft across the state, the California
22 legislature passed SGMA to provide for the sustainable management of groundwater basins. (Water
23 Code, § 10720.1, subd. (a).)

24 25. To that end, SGMA authorized local agencies to establish governance over the state's
25 groundwater resources by forming GSAs. Once formed, GSAs were required to define and monitor
26 groundwater conditions in their respective subbasins, and to adopt GSPs establishing standards and

27 methods to achieve the "sustainability goal." (See Water Code, § 10727, subd. (a).) SGMA defines the
28 "sustainability goal" as "the existence and implementation of one or more groundwater sustainability

(7327/027/01351595,DOCX) 3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

plans that achieve sustainable groundwater management by identifying and causing the implementation

2. of measures targeted to ensure that the applicable basin is operated within its sustainable yield." (Water
3 Code, § 10721, subd. (u).)

4 26. Subbasins identified by the Department of Water Resources ("DWR") as "critically

5 overdrafted" are subject to accelerated planning and implementation requirements. (See, e.g., Water
6 Code, § 10720.7.) Among other things, GSAs managing critically overdrafted subbasins are required

7 to achieve the sustainability goal within twenty years (the "Implementation Period"). (See Water Code,
8 § 10727.2, subd. (b).)

9 27. To facilitate achievement of the sustainability goal, SGMA grants GSAs authority to
10 regulate the use of groundwater resources within the agency's boundaries, including authority to limit

11 or suspend groundwater extractions, to authorize transfers of groundwater allocations, and to establish
12 accounting rules to allow unused allocations to be carried over from year-to-year. (See Water Code,
13 10726.4.)

14 B. Groundwater Management in the Madera Subbasin

15 28. The Madera Subbasin underlies approximately 350,000 acres, all within Madera County,
16 and is bounded on the south by the Kings Subbasin, in the west by the Delta-Mendota Subbasin, in the
17 north by the Chowchilla Subbasin, and in the east by the foothills of the Sierra Nevada.

18 29. Seven GSAs oversee groundwater management within the Madera Subbasin; the City of
19 Madera GSA, the Madera County GSA, the MID GSA, the Madera Water District GSA, the Gravelly
20 Ford Water District GSA, the New Stone Water District GSA, and the Root Creek Water District GSA
21 (collectively, the "Madera Subbasin GSAs").

22 30. The City of Madera GSA, the Madera County GSA, the Madera Irrigation District GSA,
23 and the Madera Water District. GSA (collectively, the "Joint GSP GSAs") manage their respective
24 a jurisdictions under a single, joint plan covering approximately 94% of the Madera Subbasin (the "Joint
25 GSP" or "Plan"). The remaining 6% of the subbasin is managed by the Gravelly Ford Water District
26 GSA, the New Stone Water District GSA, and the Root Creek Water District GSA under three, separate
27 GSPs prepared individually for their respective regions.

FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

C. Development and Adoption of the Joint GSP

2 31. Beginning in March of 2019, representatives from each of the Joint GSP GSAs (the
3 "Coordination Committee") participated in a series of technical workshops to facilitate the Joint GSP'S
4 development.

5 32. At the Coordination Committee's May 29, August 7, October 22, and December 2, 2019,

6 meetings, certain details of the draft sustainability plan fluctuated as development progressed and the
7 public was given an opportunity to comment. But one feature always remained the same. At every
8 meeting, the Coordination Committee showed : presentation indicating that to achieve the sustainability
9 goal the Madera County GSA would need to implement a "Crop Water Use Reduction Program" capable
10 of generating net benefit of "90,000 af"* per year by 2040.

11 33. The Joint GSP GSAs adopted the Joint GSP in January of 2020, which was subsequently
12 submitted to DWR. (See Water Code, § 10733.4, subd. (a).)

13 34. Petitioners agreed to adopt the Joint GSP specifically because of the commitment

14 Respondents made therein to reduce overdraft from 90,000 afy to zero by implementing the Plan's
15 demand management program.

16 D. The Joint GSP

17 35. The Joint GSP explains that to achieve the sustainability goal by 2040 the Madera
18 Subbasin GSAs must implement "projects" (i.e., structural features that supplement and expand
19 available water supplics) and "management actions" (i.e., programs or policies designed to reduce
20 groundwater use) sufficient to eliminate the Madera Subbasin's water budget "shortage." "Shortage".-
21 essentially overdraft-describes the amount of groundwater extraction in excess of active groundwater
22 recharge.

23 36. According to the Joint GSP, the sustainable native groundwater supply within the Madera
24 County GSA is also approximately 90,000 afy. However, consumptive water use in the County GSA
25 far exceeds the sustainable yield and the County GSA's three projects cannot generate anywhere near
26| enough new water to offset the overdraft occurring within its boundaries. Therefore, the Joint GSP calls
27 ///
28| ///

(7327/027/01351595.DOCX) 7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIER

ud for the County to implement a management action to gradually reduce groundwater extractions over the

2 Implementation Period.

3 37. The Joint GSP estimates an average annual shortage in the Madera Subbasin of 165,900

4 acre feet per year ("afy"). This figure is based on 2015 land use data and average precipitation rates
5 between 1989 and 2015. To eliminate the shortage, the Joint GSP calls for reducing groundwater use
6 by 105,900 afy and increasing active groundwater recharge by 60,000 afy between 2020 and 2040.
• .-. 7 38. Consistent with Respondents' representations in the Coordination Committee meetings,
8 the Joint GSP contemplates achievement of the 105,900 afy target primarily by reducing use within the ... 9 County GSA in the amount of 90,000 afy. The remaining 15,900 afy comes from projects involving the
10 replacement of irrigated acreage with permanent recharge basins. Notably, Respondents have not taken

11 any action to plan or implement these recharge projects.

12 39. In accordance with the requirements of to section 354.44 of title 23 of the California
13 Code of Regulations, the Joint GSP expressly quantifies the amount of demand management that will
14 be necessary to achieve the sustainability goal.2 It states:

15 At this time, based on the expected yield of the projects identified [herein], the Madera County demand management program will, by 2040, reduce ayerage
16 annual groundwater pumping by 90,000 acre-feet. However, if Madera County project yields are lower than initially estimated, Madera County will increase the
17 level of demand management.
18 (Emphasis added.)

19 40. Notably, the Joint GSP does not state that the County may modify the level of demand
20 management if demand increases in the future, or for any other reason. It only permits the County to
21  increase the level of demand management in the event yields from its three projects are lower than
•.. -... 22 anticipated. It continues:
23 ///

24

25 Unlike the Madera County GSA, all the other Joint GSP GSAs are capable of reaching sustainability during the

26 Implementation Period without implementing demand reduction programs.
Section 354.44, subdivision (a) provides that each GSP "shall include a description of the projects and management
27 actions the Agency has determined will achieve the sustainability goal for the basin, including projects and management actions to respond to changing conditions in the basin." Additionally, "[if overdraft conditions are identified through the
28 analysis required by section 354.18, the Plan shall describe projects or management actions, Including ( quantification of demand reduction or other methods, for the mitigation of overdraft." (23 Cal. Code. Regs., § 354.44, subd. (b)(2) (emphasis added).)

8 (7327/027/01351595.DOCX) VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLA INT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 Starting in 2020 and continuing through 2025, average annual groundwater pumping will be reduced by 2% (of the total demand reduction amount) per

3 year, for a total cumulative reduction of 10% by 2025. Groundwater pumping will be reduced by 6% per year starting in 2026 and continuing

4 through 2040.... The annual reduction in pumping in Madera County will
equal 90,000 acre feet by 2040.
5 (Emphasis added.)

6 41.

7 In other words, Respondents agreed to immediately restrict overdraft groundwater use to

8 90,000 afy as part of the demand management program, and to reduce use above the sustainable yield
from 90,000 afy in 2020 to 0 afy in 2040. The reductions would initially be 2% through 2025, but would
9 increase to 6% starting in 2026. However, if Respondent's contemplated recharge projects did not come
10| to fruition, or did not realize 15,900 afy of additional yield, Respondents recognized they would need to
11 reduce overdraft use between 2020 and 2040 even further.
12 42. To ensure demand reduction targets are achieved, the Plan identifies several methods that
13 may be used to monitor and enforce groundwater extraction limits, including use of satellite observations
14 | and exercising authority under Water Code section 10726.4, subdivision (a)(2), which authorizes GSAs
15 to limit or suspend extractions from individual groundwater wells or extractions from groundwater wells
16 in the aggregate.
17 E.

. -* 18 Development of the County's Demand Mauagement Program

*..• 43. On February 6, 2020, the Madera County GSA Advisory Committee (*Advisory
19 Committee") began holding public meetings to discuss the County's options for achieving the demand
20 reduction called for in the Joint GSP.

21 44. At the first such meeting, County staff showed a PowerPoint a presentation that, among
22 other things, summarized the need for demand management and the Joint GSP's requirements. The
23 presentation noted that pursuant to section 354.44, subdivision (b)(2) of title 23 of the California Code
24 of Regulations, if overdraft conditions are identified in a basin, the GSP must "describe projects or
25 management actions, including a quantification of demand reduction or other methods, for the mitigation
26 of overdraft." (Emphasis in original.) Subsequent slides stated that the Joint GSP's "[c]onsumptive use
27 reduction target is- 90,000 af/yr by 2040" and that this reduction would be achieved by reducing
28 | ///

{7327/027/0[351595.DOCX) 9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

allocations by 2% each year for the first 5 years, and then 6% each year for the following 15 years,
2 culminating in a "Annual Reduction" of 90,000" af by 2040.

3 45. The 90,000 afy target was confirmed again when the Joint Plan GSAs submitted their
4 first annual report to DWR in April of 2020 ("2020 Annual Report"),3 which stated that the County's
5 "management action is expected to result in a large reduction in groundwater pumping (roughly 90,000
6 AF per year by 2040) at the cost of reduced crop production and related economic activities in Madera
7 County." (Emphasis added.) Similarly, a table summarizing the status of all projects describes the
8| County's demand management program as "In Implementation" with an "Estimated Average Annual
9 Benefit" of "90,000" af. Likewise, an economic impact analysis included in the 2020 Annual Report
10 states that "[full implementation [of the County's demand management program] occurs by 2040,
11 resulting in a net reduction in crop water use of 90,000 acre-feet per year at that time." (Emphasis
12 added.) The document explains:
13 During the years 2021 - 2025 groundwater pumping will be reduced by about

14 1,800 acre-feet annually (i.e., by 1,800 acre-feet in 2021, by 3,600 acre-feet in 2022, etc.). From 2026 - 2040 groundwater will be reduced by an
15 additional 5,400 AF each year to reach the full 90,000 acre-feet of demand reduction needed for sustainability by 2040.
16

17 (Emphasis added.)

18 46. At the Advisory Committee's June 4, 2020 meeting, staff, noting that it had a "fixed
19 amount of water to allocate," proposed achieving the demand reduction target by creating an allocation
20 system consisting of two categories of water: "Native Groundwater" (i.e., sustainable yield) and
21 "Transitional Water" (i.e., continued overdraft). (Emphasis added.) Whereas allocations of the former
22  would remain constant through the Implementation Period, allocations of the latter would be
23 incrementally reduced to zero by 2040 based on the percentages set forth in the Joint GSP.

24 47. Over the next several months, the Advisory Committee explored various proposals
25 related to the details of an allocation system, such as guiding principles, the use of satellite-based

28 After adoption of a GSP, GSAS are required to submit annual reports to DWR by April each year, (Water Code, § 10728.) The annual reports must include, inter alia, a "description of progress towards implementing the Plan," including "implementation of projects or management actions." (23 Cal. Code Regs., § 356.2, subd. (c).)

monitoring, and the creation of farm units to allow transfers of allocations between certain parcels.

2 However, the Advisory Committee never proposed specific allocation amounts,

3 48. The Advisory Committee's final meeting was held on November 12, 2020. At that
4 meeting, the Advisory Committee adopted a resolution titled "Resolution Recommending a
5 Groundwater Allocation Approach to be Adopted by the Board of Directors."

6 49. The resolution's recitals observed that "consumptive use of groundwater within the

7 County GSA boundaries exceeds the available sustainable yield," and that the Joint GSP "identified
g demand reduction as a critical management a action to achieve SGMA objectives." The recitals further

9 noted that "the County GSAs have analyzed groundwater use over historical periods to the present, and
10 have noticed a significant increase in water demand caused by recent plantings of permanent crops and
11 the replacement of lower-water using plants with higher-water using plants, thus further exacerbating
12| the challenges the GSPs seek to address with respect to achieving sustainability within the subbasins."

13 50. The resolution articulated seven "key principles" for the County's allocation approach
14 and established the classifications of "sustainable yield" (defined as "water that naturally exists in the
15 subbasins from seepage and percolation") and "transitional water" (defined as "continued overdraft of
16 the subbasins (that] will incrementally decrease during the GSP implementation period." The resolution,
17 which passed 9-1 with one member absent, did not disclose the initial allocation of transitional water.

18 51. Then, on November 17, 2020, staff provided the Board with an update on the Advisory
19 Committee's activities. In the presentation to the Board, staff-for the very first time---publicly

20 proposed an initial allocation of transitional water, The figure was calculated by subtracting the

21 sustainable yield (i.e., 90,000 afy) from the total evapotranspiration of applied water ("ETA W"),
22 According to staff, to perform this calculation, the Board could use the ETAW data in the Joint GSP or

23 it could use new data collected by the County's contractor using a different methodology. Regardless

24 of which data was used, staff explained, the transitional water allocation would reduce incrementally
25 each year for 20 years and the "[s]ame end point [would be] reached by 2040."
26 52. Although staff's presentation acknowledged that the options presented to the Board were
27 not the only options available to determine the initial allocation of transitional water, staff did not
28 acknowledge the 90,000 af demand reduction target expressly set forth in the Joint GSP. Indeed, when

(7327/027/01351595.DOCX) 1
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1| quoting to the relevant provisions of the Joint GSP, staff's presentation conveniently omitted any
2 reference to the Joint GSP's 90,000 af demand reduction target, focusing instead on its discussion of
incremental reductions of 2% of the target for the first 5 years and 6% for the following 15 years.
4 Additionally, no discussion occurred regarding whether permitting an initial allocation of transitional
5 water greater than the amount specified in the Joint GSP might cause undesirable results, as defined by

6 SGMA, or otherwise negatively impact the Madera Subbasin during the Implementation Period.

7 53. According to staff, using the Joint GSP's data yielded an initial transitional water
8 allocation of approximately 100,000 afy, This figure was calculated using the Joint GSP's ETAW data
9 for water year ("WY") 2014, which indicated ETAW in the amount of 190,000 af.

10 54. Despite the enormous significance the ETAW figure plays in staff's formula for
11 determining the initial transitional water allocation, no explanation was provided as to why staff believed
12 WY 2014a critically dry year-should be the baseline, as opposed to (i) any of the 25 other years
13 analyzed in the Joint GSP, (ii) the historical average ETAW, or (iii) the historical averages based on
14 WY type.' Notably, use of the historical average ETAW for dry years would have yielded an initial
15 transitional water allocation of approximately 92,000 af, which is consistent with the figure expressly
16 set forth in the Joint GSP's description of the County's demand management program.

17 55. The other option, according to staff, Was to calculate the initial transitional water
18 allocation using "current" ETAW based on new data collected by the County's contractor using a
19| different methodology than what was used for the Joint GSP. Staff represented that this figure was
20 approximately 208,000 af based on data from WY 2018, yielding an initial transitional water allocation

21 of 118,000 af. Again, no explanation was given as to why WY 2018 should serve as the baseline, as
22 opposed to other years included in the contractor's analyses, such as WY 2017 or WY 2019, which

23 would have both yielded significantly lower initial allocations.

2.4 56. As the presentation was only an informational update, no formal action was taken by the
25 Board at the meeting.

26 //l.

27 To illustrate, if staff had used WY 2010, an above normal year, its formula would have yielded an initial transitional 28| water allocation of approximately 57,000 af. In contrast, use of the 2015 ETAW, another critically dry year, would have yielded an initial transitional water allocation of approximately 132,000 af. Alternatively, use of the average ETAW between WYs 1989 and 2014 would have yielded an initial transitional water allocation of approximately 71,000 af.

2 The County's Adoption of the Demand Management Program
1, Resolution 2020-166

3 57.

4 On December 15, 2020, the Board passed Resolution 2020-166, adopting the Advisory

5 Committee's recommended framework for the demand management program.5 Resolution 2020-166,
titled "Resolution Adopting a Groundwater Allocation Approach for the Groundwater Sustainability
6 Plan," was identical to the resolution passed by the Advisory Committee, except that it included an
7 exhibit specifying an initial allocation of transitional water in the amount of 101,000 af,5 which was to
8 be reduced by 2% each year until 2025. Resolution 2020-166 did not contain any findings related to

9 CEQA compliance.

10 58. Pursuant to Resolution 2020-166, groundwater users would be given an opportunity to
in 11 enroll in the Program every five years. Those enrolled would be permitted to pump a designated quantity
12 of sustainable yield and transitional water each year in exchange for payment of fee. Users would be
13 permitted to share their allocations within designated "farm units" only.

14 2. Resolution 2021-069

15 59.

16 After the December 15, 2020 meeting, the Board did not take any formal action with
respect to the Program for six months, until June 8, 2021. At that time, the Board considered Resolution
17 2021-069, titled "Resolution Establishing Groundwater Allocation Amounts for 2021 Through 2025
18 and Farm Unit Documentation," which sought to refine various elements of the Program, including how

19 the County would determine the existence of a "farm unit," and to establish allocation amounts for the
20 specified years.

21 60. During the meeting, staff presented three options for the Board's consideration. "Option
22 A" provided an initial transitional water allocation of 101,000 af, whereas "Option B" and "Option Cn
23 both provided an allocation of 113,000 af.' Notably, while Option A's initial transitional water
24 allocation was consistent with the amount approved in Resolution 2020-166, Options B and C authorized

25

26 The Madera County GSA has land in the Madera Subbasin, the Chowchilla Subbasin, and the Delta-Mendota Subbasin and Resolutions 2020-166, 2021-069, and 2021-113 contain allocation amounts for all three of those subbasins.

27 Unless otherwise noted, all references to the resolutions' allocation amounts refer to allocations in the Madera Subbasin.

28 Although staff's calculations at the Board's November 17, 2020 meeting indicated an initial transitional water allocation of 100,000 af, no explanation was offered as to why an additional 1,000 af was added.
Option C differed from Option B in that Option C restricted transitional water availability to irrigated acreage, whereas Option B permitted "never irrigated" land to receive an allocation of transitional water.

|l (7327/027/01351595.DOCX} 13

1 significantly more overdraft. Additionally, staff had previously proposed to use ETAW from WY 2018
2 to calculate an alternative transitional water allocation. Yet that approach was now discarded in favor

3 of using WY 2020 for Options B and C. Like the WY 2018 calculation, the WY 2020 calculation was

4 not based on data from the Joint GSP, but new data collected by the County's contractor using different

5 methodology.

6 61. At the conclusion of its presentation, staff recommended that the Board adopt the

7 resolution with Option C, providing an initial transitional water allocation of 113,000 af based on 2020

8 ETAW. Again, no explanation was offered as to why nO consideration was given to the 90,000 af
9 amount expressly set forth and agreed to in the Joint GSP, why staff had now discarded WY 2018 as the

10 basis for an alternative initial allocation of transitional water, or why staff believed its contractor's WY

11 2020 data more was more appropriate for calculating the baseline allocation than data from the Joint
12 GSP (e.g., historical averages or averages based on water year types).
13 62. Unlike Resolution 2020-166, Resolution 2021-069 included CEQA findings. It stated
14 that adoption of the resolution was exempt from CEQA pursuant to sections 15307 and 15308 of title
15 14 of the California Code of Regulations ("CEQA Guidelines") and the "common sense" exemption.
16 At the close of the public hearing, the Board approved Option C and passed Resolution 2021-069 by a

17 unanimous vote.

18 63. By adopting Option C, Respondents effectively reduced the amount of demand reduction
19 called for in the Joint GSP and rewarded irrigators who were not only responsible for necessitating
20 demand management in the first place, but also, who had continued to exacerbate the overdraft problem

21 by planting an ever-increasing number of permanent, water-intensive crops while the Joint GSP was
22 being developed and implemented.

23 64. Despite this, Respondents have not published any analyses purporting to explain or
24 justify their decision to disregard the demand management amount quantified in the Joint GSP, as
25 required by the SGMA regulations, or their decision to establish the initial transitional water allocation
26| using new data based on different methodologies than employed in the Joint GSP. Nor have
27 Respondents published any technical reports purporting to explain or justify the arbitrary choices made
28 with respect to the water years selected as the basis for its determination of the initial transitional water

(7327/027/01351595.DOCX) 14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIER

allocation, or any report, analysis, or study addressing the potential for adverse impacts to the Madera

2 Subbasin resulting from the decision to permit more overdraft over the Implementation Period than

3 agreed to in the Joint GSP.

4 65. Petitioners submitted a letter to the Board expressing their concerns with the Program.
5 The letter made four main points: First, that the Program is in direct conflict with the Joint GSP because

6 it provides an initial baseline of 113,000 af of transitional water for demand management when the Joint
7 GSP permits only 90,000 af. Second, that the Program appears to monetize overdraft for the benefit of

8 the Madera County GSA and its landowners at the expense of others relying on the Madera Subbasin.
9 Third, that the Madera County GSA's sustainable yield calculation improperly included lands not

10 physically part of the Madera Subbasin. And lastly, that the Board's approval of the Program violated
11 CEQA because the approval was not statutorily or categorically exempt from CEQA's environmental
12 review requirements and Respondents failed to prepare an initial study analyzing the Program's potential

13 to cause significant environmental impacts.

14 66. As the letter explained, transitional water was, by Respondents' own definition,
15 overdraft, and by permitting a 113,000 af baseline of overdraft, rather than 90,000 af, the Program will
16 cause more overdraft over the course of the 20-year Implementation Period. To make matters worse,
17 while the Joint GSP called for the first incremental reduction to occur in 2021, the Program would not
18 commence its incremental reductions until 2022 at the earliest, and perhaps even later. The fact that

19 Respondents' initial allocation of transitional water will eventually be reduced to zero in accordance
20 with the percentages set forth in the Joint GSP does not mean it cannot cause any significant
21 | environmental impacts. Whereas the Joint GSP contemplated 264,600 af of cumulative overdraft
22 between 2020 and 2022, the Program would permit 336,740 af of cumulative overdraft over the same
23| period, an increase of 72,140 af, These differences would continue to accumulate over time, ultimately
24 causing 321,200 additional af of overdraft during the Implementation Period.

25 3. Resolution 2021-113

26 67. On August 17, 2021, the Board considered Resolution 2021-113, titled "Resolution
27 Establishing Groundwater Allocation Refinements."

3 Resolution 2021-113 made additional refinements to the Program, including establishing
rules and procedures for enrollment, making changes to farm units, carryover of unused water
allocations, allocation of recharge credits, and appealing the County's determination of ETAW
4 attributed to farm units. Resolution 2021-113 also increased the frequency of enrollment periods from

5 every five years to every year. In addition, Resolution 2021-113 reapproved and readopted the baseline
6 allocation amounts in Table A and announced that allocations would be available beginning in the fall
7 of 2021.

8 69.

9 The resolution initially included a provision limiting the amount of transitional water that
could be carried over from year to year to 50% of the initial allocation; however, this provision was
10 stricken when the Board moved to adopt the resolution.

11
• •-11 70. As with Resolution 2021-069, Resolution 2021-113 included CEQA findings stating that
12 the Board's adoption of the resolution was exempt from CEQA pursuant to sections 15307 and 15308
13  of the CEQA Guidelines and the "common sense" exemption.

14 71.

16 Over Petitioners"objections, the Board adopted Resolution 2021-113, as modified, by a
15 unanimous vote, with two members absent.

72. Following Respondents' approval of the Program, Petitioners endeavored to resolve their
17 dispute with Respondents without the need for litigation. To ensure the parties had an opportunity for
18 informal resolution, Petitioners a and Respondents executed a series of tolling agreements extending the
19 deadline for Petitioners to challenge the Program under CEQA until December 8, 2021.

21 IV.

22 CAUSES OF ACTION

23 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

24 Writ of Mandate - Violation of CEQA

25 73. (All Respondents)

27 Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs 1 through 71
26 in their entirety as though fully set forth herein.
74. CEQA applies to public agency decisions to carry out, authorize, or approve projects that
28 could have adverse effects on the environment. Where applicable, CEQA requires agencies to inform

|| (7327/027/01351595.D0CX] 16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

..

1 themselves about the environmental effects of their proposed actions, carefully consider all relevant
2 information before committing to a proposed course of action, give the public an opportunity to
.- 3 comment on environmental issues associated with the agency's action, and avoid or reduce significant
4 environmental impacts when feasible to do so.

5 75. To ensure compliance with CEQA, a public agency considering whether to carry out,
6 authorize, or approve a discretionary project must first conduct a preliminary review to determine

7 whether CEQA applies. This entails evaluating whether the activity in question constitutes a "project"
under CEQA and, if so, whether any exemptions apply so as to excuse CEQA's environmental review
requirements. If the activity qualifies as a "project" and there are no applicable exemptions, then the
10 agency must prepare an initial study to determine whether CEQA's environmental review requirements
11 can be satisfied by the adoption of a negative declaration or whether preparation of an environmental
12| impact report is necessary,

13 76. In this case, Respondents violated CEQA by erroneously determining that its approval
14 of the Program was exempt from environmental review requirements and failing to prepare an initial
15 study, and by impermissibly piecemealing environmental review.
16 77. The Program, as originally adopted by Resolution 2020-166 and as subsequently
17 modified by Resolutions 2021-069 and 2021-113, constitutes a "project" within the meaning of CEQA
18 and the CEQA Guidelines.

19 78. Respondents' adoption of Resolution 2020-166, Resolution 2021-069, and Resolution
20 2021-113 (collectively, the "Resolutions") were each discretionary actions within the meaning of CEQA

21 and the CEQA Guidelines.

22 79. Respondents' adoption of the Resolutions constituted an "approval" of the Program
23 within the meaning of CBQA and the CEQA Guidelines.

24 80. The Madera County GSA is the "lead agency" under CEQA and is therefore obligated to
25 conduct any environmental review required by in connection with the Program's approval.

26 81. The Board is the Madera County GSA's decisionmaking body.

27 82. Prior to adopting the Resolutions, or otherwise deciding to undertake the Program,

28 Respondents did not perform environmental review, as required by CEQA,

17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT (7327/027/01351595.DOCX)

FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-. .*

- 83. Respondents' adoption of the Resolutions, and their decisions to undertake the Program,

2 were not exempt from environmental review under CEQA, and any contrary finding by Respondents

3 lacked substantial evidence or otherwise constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

4 84. Respondents' decision to undertake the Program has the potential to cause significant

5 environmental impacts because the Program authorizes and encourages overdraft of the Madera
6 Subbasin's groundwater supplies, discourages conservation of groundwater resources, and will, over the
7 course of the Implementation Period, cause more than 1,401,000 af of overdraft within the Madera

8 Subbasin. This amount is 321,200 af more than contemplated by the Joint GSP and the Joint GSP GSAs.
9 when developing and adopting the Joint GSP.

10 85. Undesirable results, within the meaning of SGMA, and other adverse environmental
11 impacts, within the meaning of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, may occur to the Madera Subbasin
12 as a direct and proximate result of Respondents' decisions to carry out the Program, including, but not
13 limited to, reduced groundwater levels, lowering of the water table, loss of aquifer storage capacity, and
14 failure of agricultural and domestic supply wells, among other things.

15 A. The Class and 8 Categorical Exemptions Are Inapplicable

16 86. Categorical exemptions are set forth in the CEQA Guidelines and reflect a determination
17 by the Secretary of the Natural Resources Agency that "the environmental changes typically associated
18 with projects in [a particular) class are not significant effects within the meaning of CEQA." (Berkley
19 Hillside Preservation V. City of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1086, 1104.) Thus, if a categorical
20 exemption applies, no formal environmental evaluation is required under CEQA. However, a

21 categorical exemption "can be relied on only if a factual evaluation of the agency's proposed activity
22 reveals that it applies." (Muzzy Ranch Co. v. Colano County Airport Land Use Commission (2007) 41
23 Cal.4th 372, 386.) Thus, an agency invoking a categorical exemption "has the burden of demonstrating
24 that substantial evidence supports its factual finding that the project fell within the exemption." (Save
25 Our Big Trees v. City of Santa Cruz (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 694, 710-11.)

26 87. Section 15308 of the CEQA Guidelines, also known as the Class 8 categorical exemption,
27 exempts actions by regulatory agencies "to assure the maintenance, restoration, enhancement, or

28 protection of the environment." (Emphasis added.) Section 15307 of the CEQA Guidelines, also

(7327/027/01351595.DOCX) 18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

known 8 as the Class 8 categorical exemption, is nearly identical, only narrower in scope. It exempts
2 actions by regulatory agencies "to assure the maintenance, restoration, or enhancement of a natural

3 resource." (Emphasis added.)

4 88.

5 Neither is applicable here. As approved, the Program is designed to increase the amount
of overdraft that will occur in the Madera Subbasin relative to what is called for by the Joint GSP.
6 Therefore, the Program does not "assure the maintenance, restoration, enhancement, or protection"* of

7 4the environment" or "a natural resource." On the contrary, the Program circumvents, and indeed
8 undermines, the plan that does "assure the maintenance, restoration, enhancement, or protection"* of

9 groundwater resources in the Madera Subbasin-i.e., the Joint GSP.

10 89.

11 Further, even if Respondents could assert the Program had some environmental benefit,
the Class 7 and Class 8 exemptions are nevertheless inapplicable where a regulation designed to reduce
12 an environmental effect has the capability of causing adverse environmental effects. (See, e.g., Callf.
13 Unions for Reliable Energy V, Mojave Desert Air Quality Mgmt. Dist. (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 1225,
14 1246-47.)

15 90. Even where a categorical exemption applies on its face, CEQA compliance is not excused
16 if (i) "there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment a

.. ..-/ 17| due to unusual circumstances;" or (ii) the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in

18

19 the same place, over time is significant." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15300.2, subds. (b) and (c).) Here,
"unusual circumstances" exist because the Program is designed to increase overdraft and exacerbate
20 overdraft conditions, contrary to what the Joint GSP GSAs agreed to when developing and adopting the

21

22 Joint GSP. And, because the Program will cause more than 321,200 additional af of overdraft over the
course of the Implementation Period relative what was called for in the Joint GSP, there is a "reasonable
23 possibility" that the Program will a have a significant effect on the environment. (See, c.g., Berkeley
24 Hillside Preservation v. City of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1086, 1115.) Moreover, the Program will
25 have cumulatively considerable impacts due to its exacerbation of overdraft conditions over the course

26 of the 20-year Implementation Period.

B. The "Common Sense" Exemption Is Inapplicable

2 91, The "common sense" exemption exempts activities "[w]here it can be seen with certainty
3 that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the environment."

4 ..• (CEQA Guidelines, § 15061, subd. (b)(3) [emphasis added].) However, as noted above, Respondents'

5 decision to carry out the Program has the potential to cause significant environmental impacts because
6 it will cause more than 1,401,000 af of overdraft within the Madera Subbasin, which is.321,200 af more
7 than contemplated by the Joint GSP.

8 92, Respondents have failed to meet their burden of showing that "it can be seen with
9 certainty that there is no possibility" that this additional overdraft "may have significant effect on the
10 environment." (Id.) On the contrary, it is obvious that there is a reasonable possibility exists that the

11 additional overdraft caused by the Program may cause adverse environmental impacts to the Madera
12 Subbasin, including, but not limited to, reduced groundwater levels, lowering of the water table, loss of
13 aquifer storage capacity, and failure of agricultural and domestic supply wells, among other things.
14 C. Respondents Impermissibly Piecemealed Environmental Review

15 93. The "requirements of CEQA cannot be avoided by piecemeal review which results from
16 chopping a large project into many little ones-each with a minimal potential impact on the
17 environment---which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences." (Envt'l Prot. Info. Ctr. V. Dept.
18 of Forestry & Fire Prot. (2008) 44 Cal.4th 459, 503; Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth,

19 Inc. V. City of Sonora (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1223.) CEQA thus "forbids piecemeal review of
the significant environmental impacts of a project." (Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay Comm. v. Bd. of

21 Port Comm'rs (2011) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1358 [internal quotations omitted].) Rather, when lead 20

22 agency undertakes the environmental review process, the lead agency must review and consider the
23| "whole of [the] action," (CEQA Guidelines, § 15378 [emphasis added]), and consider "the effects, both
24| individual and collective, of all activities involved in [the] project." (Pub. Res. Code, § 21002.1(d)
25| [emphasis added].) It is only through a complete and accurate "view of the project [that] affected
26 outsiders and public decision-makers [may] balance the proposal's benefit against its environmental
27 cost, consider mitigation measures, assess the advantage of terminating the proposal. . . and weigh other
28 alternatives in the balance." (Berkeley Keep Jets, supra, 91 Cal.App.4th at 1358.)

3 All of the Resolutions are part of the same "project" under CEQA, as each is intended to
2 establish a groundwater demand management program-i.e., the Program. Therefore, Respondents

5 were required to consider the cumulative potential impacts associated with the Program in its entirety,
4 rather than the potential impacts associated with each individual resolution in isolation. Respondents

6 failed to do this, and thereby impermissibly piecemealed environmental review in violation of CEQA.

7 95. Petitioners Are Entitled to Relief

R

© Petitioners have clear, present, and beneficial right to performance by Respondents of

10 their duties under CEQA, and Respondents have the duty and capacity to perform their duties under
CEQA. Respondents' decision to adopt the Program even though it is inconsistent with the requirements
of the Joint GSP deprives Petitioners, and others within the Madera Subbasin, of groundwater recharge
11 benefits that would otherwise accrue during the Plan's implementation period, and completely

12 disregards the clear environmental impacts the Program will cause in its present form, including, but not
13 limited to, reduced groundwater levels, lowering of the water table, loss of aquifer storage capacity, and
14 failure of agricultural and domestic supply wells, among other things. Respondents' failure to perform
15 their duties requires this a Court to issue a writ of mandate directing them to discharge their duties under
16 Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21080.5, 21168,
17 and 21168.5.

19 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

20 Writ of Mandate - Violation of SGMA

21 96. (All Respondents)

22

23 Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs 1 through 71
in their entirety as though fully set forth herein.
97. Respondents' adoption of the Program was arbitrary, capricious, entirely lacking in
24 evidentiary support, and unlawfully or procedurally unfair because Respondents exceeded the authority
25 granted to them pursuant to section 10726.4, subdivision (a) of the Water Code by failing to adhere to
26 the restrictions attending the exercise authority pursuant to that section.

27 98. Section 10726.4, subdivision (a)(3) establishes authority for a GSA "[t]o authorize
28 temporary and permanent transfers of groundwater extraction allocations within the agency's

|| (7327/027/01351595.DOCX) 21

FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

boundaries, if the total quantity of groundwater extracted in any water year is consistent with the
2 provisions of the groundwater sustalnability plan."

3 99. Resolution 2021-069 authorized "transfers of groundwater extraction allocations within

4 the agency's boundaries" by permitting groundwater allocations to be shared within designated farm

5 units. However, the amount of transitional water allocated in the Madera Subbasin each year by the

6 Program exceeds the amounts permitted by the Joint GSP. Therefore, "the total quantity of groundwater
7 extracted in any water year is [not] consistent with the provisions of the groundwater sustainability

8 plan." Accordingly, Respondents' adoption of the Program exceeded the authority set forth in Water

9 Code section 10726.4, subdivision (a)(3).

10 100. Section 10726.4, subdivision (a)(4) authorizes a GSA "[t]o establish accounting rules to
11 allow unused groundwater extraction allocations issued by the agency to be carried over from one year

12 to another and voluntarily transferred, if the total quantity of groundwater extracted in any five-year
13 period is consistent with the provisions of the groundwater sustainability plan."

14 101. Resolution 2021-113 "establish[ed] accounting rules to allow unused groundwater
15  extraction allocations issued by [the Madera County GSA] to be carried over from one year to another.»

16 However, pursuant to Resolution 2021-069, the amount of transitional groundwater allocated in the

17 Madera Subbasin for the years 2020 through 2025 exceeds the amounts permitted by the Plan over that

18 same period. Therefore, "the total quantity of groundwater extracted in any five-year period is [not)
19 consistent with the provisions of the groundwater sustainability plan." Accordingly, Respondents'
20 adoption of the Program exceeded the authority set forth in Water Code section 10726.4, subdivision

21 (a)(4).

22 102. As a GSA within the Madera Subbasin and an agency subject to the Joint GSP's
23 requirements, Petitioners have a clear, present, and beneficial a right to performance by Respondents of
24 their duties under section 10726.4, subdivision (a) of the Water Code, and Respondents have the duty

25 and capacity to perform such duties.

26 103. Petitioners do not have any other plan, speedy, or adequate remedy at law.

2 Petitioners therefore request that the Court issue a writ of mandate, pursuant to sections

3 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and the Court's inherent equitable powers, to compel

4 Respondents to set aside their decisions to carry out, undertake, or approve the Program.
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

5

6 Writ of Mandate - Arbitrary and Capricious Acts
(All Respondents)

7 105.

8 Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs 1 through 71
in their entirety as though fully set forth herein.

9 106. Respondents adoption of the Program was arbitrary, capricious, entirely lacking in
10 evidentiary support, and unlawfully or procedurally unfair because Respondents disregarded the express
11 requirements of the Joint GSP, impermissibly relied on data to establish a demand reduction target that
12 was not contained in the Joint GSP, impermissibly relied on methodologies to establish a demand
13  reduction target that was not approved for that purpose, and established an initial transitional water
14 allocation that failed to promote achievement of the sustainability goal within the Madera Subbasin in
15 accordance with the Joint GSP..

16 107. As a GSA within the Madera Subbasin and an agency subject to SGMA and the Joint
17 GSP, Petitioners have a clear, present, and beneficial right to performance by Respondents of their duties
18| under SGMA and the Joint GSP, and Respondents have the duty and capacity to perform such duties.
19 108.

20 109. Petitioners do not have any other plan, speedy, or adequate remedy at law.

21 Petitioners therefore request that the Court issue a writ of mandate, pursuant to sections

22 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and the Court's inherent equitable powers, to compel
Respondents to set aside their decisions to

23 carry out, undertake, or approve the Program,
FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

24

25 Violation of Article X, Section 2 of the California Constitution

(A.ll Respondents)

26 110. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs 1 through 71
27 in their entirety as though fully set forth herein.
28 ///

(7327/027/01351595. DOCX.). 23
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
POR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- 111. Article X, section 2 of the California Constitution provides that "because of the
2 conditions prevailing in this State the general welfare requires that the water resources of the State be

3 put to beneficial use to the fullest extent of which they are capable, and that the waste or unreasonable

4 use or unreasonable method of use of water be prevented, and that the conservation of such waters is to
a s be exercised with a view to the reasonable and beneficial use thereof in the interest of the people and
6 for the public welfare."

-..l. 7 112. Respondents' adoption of the Program violates article X, section 2 because it rewards
8 individuals for causing overdraft within the Madera Subbasin during the Joint GSP's development and
9 implementation, discourages necessary reductions in overdraft within the Madera Subbasin, and
10 perpetuates the continued unreasonable, non-beneficial use of groundwater within the Madera Subbasin.

11 113, Respondents' authorization of overdraft during the SGMA implementation period in
12 excess of the amount contemplated by the Joint GSP, and in violation of the authority granted by SGMA,
13 | constitutes a waste and unreasonable use of groundwater because it will result in an additional 276,000

14 af of overdraft, thereby undermining efforts to achieve the sustainability goal in the Madera Subbasin
15 and harming all users of groundwater from the Madera Subbasin.

16 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

17 Declaratory Relief - SGMA

18 (All Respondents)

19 114. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs through 71
20 in their entirety as though fully set forth herein.

21 115. A clear and actual controversy exists between Petitioners and Respondents regarding
22 Respondents' failure to comply with Water Code section 10726.4, subdivision (a). Petitioners contend
23 that Respondents' actions were in violation of Water Code section 10726.4, subdivision (a), Petitioners

24 are informed and believed, and on that basis allege, that Respondents dispute the foregoing contention
25 and maintain the contrary.

26 116. This controversy creates a substantial danger that Petitioners' rights will be damaged,
27 and the requirements of Water Code section 10726.4, subdivision (a) will be ignored. As such, a judicial

-h determination as to Respondents' rights and obligations under the Water Code is necessary and

2 desirable.

3 117. There is no other adequate legal remedy available to resolve this controversy.

4 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

S Declaratory Relief - Joint GSP

6 (All Respondents)

7 118. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs 1 through 71

8 in their entirety as though fully set forth herein.

9 119. A clear and actual controversy exists between Petitioners and Respondents regarding
10 Respondents' failure to adhere to the commitments stated in the Joint GSP. Petitioners contend that
11 Respondents have not complied with the Joint GSP's requirement to implement a demand management

12 program that will produce a net benefit to the Madera Subbasin of 90,000 afy by 2040. Respondents
13 dispute the foregoing contention and maintain the contrary.
14 120. This controversy creates a substantial danger that Petitioners' rights will be damaged,
15 and the requirements of the Joint GSP and SGMA will be ignored. As such, a judicial determination as
16 to Respondents' rights and obligations under the Joint GSP is necessary and desirable.
17 121. There is no other adequate legal remedy available to resolve this controversy.

18 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

19 Injunctive Relief

20 (All Respondents)

21 122. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs 1 through 71
22 in their entirety as though fully set forth herein.

23 123. Unless and until this Court issues an order immediately enjoining and restraining
24 Respondents from implementing the Program, Petitioners, and others in the Madera Subbasin, will
25 suffer irreparable harm. As result of Respondents' authorization of overdraft well beyond what is
26 permitted by the Joint GSP, Petitioners, and others in the Madera Subbasin, will be permanently
27 deprived of sustainable yield, recharge benefits, and other benefits resulting from the Joint GSP's proper
28 implementation, and will be forced to suffer reduced groundwater levels, lowering of the water table,

2 loss of aquifer storage capacity, and failure of agricultural and domestic supply wells, among other
things.

3 124.

4 Therefore, Petitioners seek a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and

Ua permanent injunction enjoining and restraining Respondents, their agents, servants, employees,
