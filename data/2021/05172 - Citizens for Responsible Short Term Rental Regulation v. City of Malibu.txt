VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Petitioner, CITIZENS FOR RESPONSIBLE SHORT TERM RENTAL REGULATION
("Petitioner"), alleges:

1. The project is the City of Malibu's Hosted Short-Term Rental Ordinance
("Ordinance" or "Project"). The Ordinance amends the Local Coastal Program and Title 17 of
the Malibu Municipal Code regulating the rental of residential units for 30 days or less (short-

6 term rentals) including, but not limited to, requiring the presence of an onsite host during short-
term rentals and other restrictions, and creating permitted uses related to short-term rental
8 citywide, amending Chapter 15.44 pertaining to operating permits for onsite wastewater
9 treatment systems.

10 2. Petitioner, Citizens for Responsible Short Term Rental Regulation ("Petitioner"),
11 is an unincorporated association whose purpose is to promote the welfare of the residents of - d77 'dnojs Mel jeuueus -1706 20  *PNS 'SIIIH Aueng 12 Malibu and to maintain the quality of life in the City of Malibu by preserving its residential
13 character, its quiet, privacy, natural beauty, open space and safety. Petitioner and its respective
8383 Wilshire a 14 members have a direct and substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondent complies
15 with laws relating to environmental protection. Petitioner and its respective members are
16 adversely affected by Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA in approving the Project.
17| Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because Petitioner and its
18 members' aesthetic and environmental interests are directly and adversely affected by
19| Respondent's' approval of the Project.
20 3. Respondent, City of Malibu ("Respondent"), is a municipal corporation under the
21 laws of the State of California. The City is the lead agency is under the California Environmental
22 Quality Act ("CEQA").
23 4. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties sued herein
24 as DOBS 1-25, inclusive, and therefore sues these Real Parties by such fictitious names.
25 Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of fictitiously named
26 Real Parties in Interest. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each
27 Respondent designated herein as a DOE has some responsibility for the events and happenings
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 alleged in this Petition.

2 5. On or about November 5, 2020, the City Council of the City of Malibu held a

3 public hearing to consider the Ordinance. Petitioner submitted a letter to the City Clerk on or
4 about October 26, 2020 objecting to the proposed categorical exemption for the Project. On or
5 about November 23, 2020, the City Council of the City of Malibu conducted a second hearing to

6 consider the Ordinance and approved the Project. The City erroneously determined that the

7 Project was exempt under the California Environmental Quality Act.

8 6. This action has been brought within the applicable statute of limitations under the
Public Resources Code. The County filed a Notice of Exemption with the County Recorder on
10 or about December 17, 2020.

11 7. This action arises under CEQA and its implementing regulations, which are
- LZ06 OSA E U11 0 1AOS MPNIS B  A R CB SIl!H Áueseg 12 prescribed by the Secretary of the California Resources Agency to be followed by all state and
13 local agencies when undertaking projects subject to CEQA. (Pub. Resources Code§ 21000 et
14 seq.; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.) This Court has jurisdiction over the matters
15 alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, and Public Resources
16 Code section 21168.5. In the alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil
17 Procedure section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code section 21168.
18 8. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394(a) venue is proper in "the county
19l in which the city or local agency is situated." Venue is proper in this Court because Respondent
20 is located in the County of Los Angeles.
21 9. Members of Petitioner and other interested persons made oral and written
22 comments on the Project and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition.
23 CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

24 10. California Environmental Quality Act is California's broadest environmental
25 law. CEQA helps to guide public agencies such as the City during issuance of permits and
26 approval of projects. Courts have interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest protection of the
27 environment within the reasonable scope of the statutes. CEQA applies to all discretionary
28

3

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 projects proposed to be conducted or approved by a City, including private projects requiring
2 discretionary government approval. See California Public Resources Code, sections 21000 -
3 21178, and Title 14 Cal. Code Regs., section 753, and Chapter 3, sections 15000 - 15387.
4 11. "CEQA broadly defines a 'project' as 'an activity which may cause either a direct

5 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the

6 environment, and ... that involves the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate,
7 or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies.' [Citation.] The statutory definition
8 is augmented by the [CEQA] Guidelines [Cal.Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.], which define
9 a 'project' as the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct
10 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the
11 environment....** Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Sonora 6 MET |auueu) 'dnoJs d77 •1706 12 (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1222, 66 Cal.Rptr.3d 645 (Tuolumne County). This includes all
13 8 elns "pAla eIJysI!M €888 I phases of a project that are reasonably foreseeable, and all related projects that are directly linked
'SIlH AueAeg 14 to the project. (CEQA Guidelines section 15378).
15 12. A strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an Environmental
16 Impact Report ("EIR") is built into CEQA which is reflected in what is known as the "fair
17 argument" standard, under which agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence an

18 in the record supports a fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the
19 environment. No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75, 82; Friends of "B" St.
20 V. City of Haywood (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988, 1002.
21 13. "The EIR is the primary means of achieving the Legislature's considered
necessary to protect, rehabilitate, 22 declaration that it is the policy of this state to "take all action
23 and enhance the environmental quality of the state.' [Citation.] The EIR is therefore 'the heart of
24 CEQA.' [Citations.] An EIR is an 'environmental "alarm bell" whose purpose it is to alert the
25 public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached ecological
26 points of no return." Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. V. Regents of University of California
27 (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

14. Under CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, if a project is not exempt and may cause
a significant effect on the environment, the agency must prepare an EIR. PRC §§ 21100, 21151;
14 Cal. Code Regs. §15064(a)(1), (f)(1). "Significant effect upon the environment" is defined as

4 "a substantial or potentially substantial adverse change in the environment." PRC §21068; 14 Cal
Code Regs §15382. A project "may" have a significant effect on the environment if there is a

6 "reasonable probability" that it will result in a significant impact. No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los
7 Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 83 n.16; Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1988) 202
8 Cal.App.3d 296, 309, 248 CR 352. This standard sets a "low threshold" for preparation of an
EIR. Pocket Protectors v. City of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App. 4th 903, 928; Bowman v. City
10 of Berkeley (2004) 122 CA4th 572, 580; Citizen Action to Serve AlL Students v. Thornley (1990)

14 15. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this
15 Petition.
16 16. Short term rentals cause numerous significant impacts on Malibu's sensitive
17 coastal environment. Malibu's serene beaches, picturesque coastal hillsides and rustic
18 community aesthetic are unique environmental resources protected by CEQA. Many of Malibu's
19 residential neighborhoods, both single- and multi-family, are directly adjacent to public beaches,
20 coastal bluffs, rock outcroppings and other resources. Vast stretches of Malibu's hillsides are
21 further characterized as Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Areas and are afforded heightened
22 protection under the Coastal Act as habitats which are "rare or especially valuable because of
23 their special nature or role in an ecosystem and which could be easily disturbed or degraded by
24 human activities and developments." Pub. Res. Code § 30107.5.
25 17. Members of Petitioner and other interested persons made oral and written
26 comments exhaustively documenting the operational environmental consequences of short-term
27 rentals, including illegal trash disposal, illegally parked vehicles, buildings falling into disrepair
28

5

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

due to absentee hosts, noise impacts and overuse of inadequate septic systems. These comments
2 further noted that the most egregious impacts occur due to absentee investor-hosts.

18. The Project will foreseeably concentrate short-term rental activity in multifamily
zones - particularly those adjacent to serene beaches and sensitive coastal habitats. The Project
permits short-term rental activity as a by-right use in the Beachfront (BF) and Multifamily
Beachfront (MFBF) Zones where such uses would currently constitute unpermitted hotel, motel

7 or bed-and-breakfast uses. Exacerbating the environmental impacts of these short-term rentals,

8 the Project permits unhosted short-term rentals in up to two units per multifamily building.
9 Given the 73 existing multifamily buildings in the BF or MFBF Zones, the Project would

10 concentrate up to 146 new, highly-impactful short-term rental units immediately adjacent to

8 11 public beaches and close to sensitive habitats including Puerco Beach and protected areas d11 'dnoJo Me] jeuueua LLZ06 SAR M PILES MH IA SIAM SI S 8 S|I!H Áueneg 12 between Topanga and Carbon Beaches.
13 19. The Project will foreseeably incentivize new development of guest houses and
14 accessory dwelling units in single-family zones. To avoid the nuisance of cohabiting with guests
15 while earning additional income, hosts will be highly motivated to construct new guest houses or
16 accessory dwelling units. The scope of development incentivized by the Project is extensive
17 because virtually every property in the Rural Residential zones would have ample lot area on
18 which to construct additional accommodations. The Project permissively defines "Guest House"
19 to include not only 900 square feet of living area, but also a 400 square foot garage. Any new
20 construction across Malibu's Rural Residential zones - which overlay its scenic coastal hillsides
21| and Environmentally Sensitive Habitat Areas is likely to result in aesthetic, biological, noise
22 and view corridor impacts.
23 20. The Project is not exempt from CEQA review pursuant to Guidelines §
24 15061(b)(3), because it cannot be seen with certainty that there is no possibility the Project would
25 have a significant environmental impact. The Project will foreseeably result in a concentration of
26 highly-impactful short-term rentals, including unhosted rentals, along stretches of public beaches
27 and adjacent to sensitive habitats. The resulting concentration of short-term rentals will

1 foreseeably result in aesthetic, biological, noise, land use and other impacts.
21. The Project is not exempt from CEQA review pursuant to Guidelines § 15031
3 because it expands permitted residential uses in the Beachfront and Multifamily Beachfront 2

4 zones to permit unhosted short-term rentals as a by-right use where such uses are not currently

5 permitted.

22. The Project is not exempt from CEQA review pursuant to Public Resources Code
7 § 21080.9 because it extends beyond the scope of an amendment "necessary for preparation and 6

8 adoption of an amendment to a local coastal program. Specifically, the Project includes
numerous qualifications for short-term rentals including permitting requirements, tax payments,
10 maintenance of a responsible caretaker available to respond to complaints, occupancy limits, 9
