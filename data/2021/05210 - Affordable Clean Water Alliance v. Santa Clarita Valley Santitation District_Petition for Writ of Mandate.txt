VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

Petitioner Affordable Clean Water Alliance ("Petitioner" or "ACWA") seeks a writ

2 of mandamus and declaratory and injunctive relief against Respondent Santa Clarita Valley

3 Sanitation District ("SCVSD" or "District") and Real Party in Interest Santa Clarita Valley

4 Water Agency ("SCVWA"), and alleges as follows:

5 INTRODUCTION AND FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

6 1. This suit challenges SCVSD's repeated attempts to violate and otherwise

7 avoid CEQA compliance in the implementation of a multi-million dollar project regarding

8 construction and/or expansion of two SCVSD water reclamation plants, whose dual and

9 interdependent purposes are to: (1) provide millions of acre feet of additional recycled

10 water for use in the Santa Clarita Valley, Valencia, and Newhall areas by constructing and
J00l- THE SILVERSTEI WHId MVI APC 11 operating an Advanced Water Treatment Facility ("AWTF") with microfiltration and
POGL-LOLL6 12 reverse osmosis ("MF/RO"); and (2) achieve the applicable chloride compliance

8 North Marengo Avenue, 13 limitations as set by the Regional Water Quality Board, including relaxed chloride
'euepesed 14 compliance limitations upon construction of the A WTF with MF/RO.

15 2. Contrary to SCVSD's current, misleading use of new nomenclature, there 5
16 was not originally a "Recycled Water Project" that was separate from the "Chloride

17 Compliance Project." Rather, under the Alternative Chloride Compliance process the

18 District has committed to since approximately 2007, the provision of high quality
19 (including potable) recycled water - and construction of the A WTF with MF/RO to
20 produce it - was the primary component of and a necessary precedent for SCVSD's

21 chloride compliance, as part of SCVSD's overarching 2013 "Chloride Compliance

22 Facilities Plan."

23 3. As envisaged by the Alternative Chloride Compliance process SCVSD

24 committed to in a 2007-2008 Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") with various
25 stakeholders, including Valencia Water Company (then owned by Newhall Land and

26 Farming), the 2013 "Chloride Compliance Facilities Plan" involves the construction of

27 AWTF with MF/RO facilities to produce high quality recycled water, upon completion of

28 which the District would and will qualify for relaxed chloride compliance requirements
- 2 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 (including 150 TMDL (total maximum daily load) instead of the initial conventional 100

2 TMDL).

4. The integration of these overriding project components (provision of

4 recycled water and chloride compliance) was stated and confirmed in, inter alia, SCVSD's

5 2013 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") on the Chloride Compliance Facilities Plan

6 and again in SCVSD's 2016 Supplemental EIR regarding Brine Management.

7 5. However, despite repeated promises to provide this increased recycled water
as part of its Chloride Compliance Facilities Plan, which promises have been made to

9 SCVSD's rate payers as part of a multi-million dollar rate increase, to the court, to other

10 public agencies such as the Dept. of Fish & Wildlife, and to the general public, including

11
POSL-LOLL6 Floor pu& 'enuesy WIY ME  S North Marengi Petitioner ACWA, SCVSD has attempted to deny its obligations and commitments to

12 provide this additional recycled water through and as part of the Chloride Compliance
13 Facilities Plan, and instead separated the Recycled Water Project out of it to attempt to

Pasaden 14 evade CEQA compliance in connection with a then-pending legal challenge to the validity
15 of SCVSD's 2013 EIR and SCVSD's subsequent 2017 Recirculated EIR. SCVSD's illegal

16 attempt to separate recycled water out of the Chloride Compliance Facilities Plan has
17 manifested itself through reference to what SCVSD now describes as a supposedly

18 separate "Recycled Water Project." On or about August 4, 2016, SCVSD made the

19 supposedly independent "Recycled Water Project" the subject of a separate Notice of

20 Preparation of a Supplemental EIR related to recycled water/stickleback ("2016 Recycled

21 Water Project SEIR").

22 6. SCVSD's latest violations of CEQA regarding its unstudied or inadequately

23 and improperly studied changes to the actual Chloride Compliance Facilities Plan occurred
24 on or about February 25, 2019 ("2019 Resolution"), when the SCVSD Board passed a
25 resolution in which it stated it was withdrawing the 2016 Recycled Water Project SEIR
26 Notice of Preparation, and purported to abandon the provision of recycled water as

27 described in the 2013 Chloride Compliance Facilities Plan.

28

- 3 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

1 7. After the 2019 Resolution, SCVSD and SCVWA actively collaborated to

2 further the Recycled Water Project, but under different names and aliases, and without

3 CEQA review.

4 8. After the 2019 Resolution, SCVSD and SCVWA have been jointly applying

5 for various grants, where SCVWA has been acting as SCVSD's Administrator and has

6 been passing through grants and loans to SCVSD, in furtherance of the Recycled Water

7 Project and without proper CEQA review.

8 9. On September 20, 2021, SCVSD approved a Subgrant Agreement with
9 SCVWA to receive a $3,000,000 grant for which SCVSD was approved for purposes of
10 constructing further recycled water infrastructure at the AWTF, in furtherance of the so-
APC 11 called separate Recycled Water Project. SCVSD invoked a CEQA categorical exemption

12 as CEQA "clearance" for the Subgrant Agreement. The legality of SCVSD's use of said
MVT NELSHIATIS 3HL YOSL-LOLL6
8 13 categorical exemption for approval of the Subgrant Agreement is the subject of this
Pasaden 14 petition.

15 10. By its initial separation and later purported rejection and abandonment of

16 the critical recycled water component of its Chloride Compliance Facilities Plan, and by

17 thereafter continuing to implement the Recycled Water Project under different names and
18 through SCVWA, including by applying for and receiving grants for that purpose but

19 without required CEQA review, SCVSD violated and continues to violate CEQA.

20 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that SCVSD's September

21 20, 2021 signing of the subgrant agreement with SCVWA to receive a $3,000,000 grant for

22 purposes of further construction at the AWTF with MF/RO and, thereby, for implementing
23 and supporting the Recycled Water Project, may have significant, unmitigable impacts on

24 the environment, but that those impacts were not studied, disclosed, allowed to be

25 commented on by other public agencies like the Dept. of Fish and Wildlife, and the public,

26 or mitigated - all in violation of CEQA.

11. Petitioner ACWA is a California unincorporated association which, along 2

3 with various of its members and supporters, seeks SCVSD's compliance with its legal

4 obligations, and supports greater creation, retention and use of recycled water for the Santa

5 Clarita Valley community's beneficial use. It is a coalition of environmental, property

6 owner, residential and business interests in the Santa Clarita Valley and surrounding areas

7 concerned with water supply, quality and cost, as well as with governmental transparency

10 SCVSD's decisions are in conformity with the requirements of law, and in having those
DO% 11 requirements properly executed and the public duties of SCVSD enforced. Petitioner and
EB Avenue, o6UBUEN ON SIZ 12 its members will be adversely affected by impacts resulting from SCVSD's actions and MVT SILVERSTEI 3HL bOGL-LOLL6 VO 'euapesed 13 approvals, and is aggrieved by the acts, decisions and omissions of SCVSD as alleged in
14 this petition. Petitioner is suing on its behalf, on behalf of its members, and on behalf of

15 all others who will be affected in the Santa Clarita, Newhall, Valencia and Los Angeles
16 County areas.

17 13. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that

18 Respondent Santa Clarita Valley Sanitation District of Los Angeles County is a special

19 district operating in Los Angeles County that is responsible for the collection and treatment
20 of wastewater within its jurisdiction and the discharge of treated wastewater, and is the

22 14. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names of the respondents sued herein as

23 DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, and therefore sues said respondents by those fictitious

24 names. Petitioner will amend the petition to allege their true names and capacities when
the same have been ascertained. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon

7 Santa Clarita Valley Water Agency Act (SB 634, Chapter 833, 2017) and is the successor

8 entity to the Castaic Lake Water Agency and Newhall County Water District, which were

9 merged into SCVWA through SB 634. Although Petitioner is unsure whether SCVWA
10 must be named as a Real Party in Interest, in an abundance of caution and based on

11
POSI-LOLL6 E DOON DEOTURCY BERSEW ALON S LE THE SILVERSTEIN LAW information and belief that SCVWA has entered into a contractual relationship with

Pasadena 14 to have an interest in this litigation, Petitioner is informed and believes that any such

15 interest is or will be adequately represented by Respondent SCVSD.

16 16. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names of the real parties sued herein as

8 13 Paragraphs through 19 inclusive, of this petition.
Pasadena, 14 21. In January 2002, SCVSD (previously, Districts Nos. 26 and 32) entered into

15 an Interconnection Agreement with Newhall Land & Farming by which SCVSD

16 committed to treat sewage of 6,000 dwelling units built by Newhall Land & Farming

17 (which Petitioner is informed and believes was subsequently acquired by FivePoint
18 Valencia, LLC ("FivePoint") under the Newhall Ranch Specific Plan.

19 22. Newhall Land & Farming's Specific Plan includes development of 22,038
20 residential units (presently, 21,500 equivalent dwelling units) and over 5 million square

21 feet of commercial space on 11,964 acres of primarily agricultural and/or undeveloped

22 land.

23 23. In or about 2005, the California Regional Water Quality Board ("Regional

24 Board") adopted new limitations of a total maximum daily load ("TMDL") of 100 TMDL

25 for chloride in the Upper Santa Clara River ("River").

26 24. In 2007-2008, SCVSD - along with various stakeholders prepared and
27 entered into an MOU, whereby SCVSD committed to alternative chloride compliance -

28 the Alternative Water Resources Management ("A WRM") program - which would allow
- 7 -

- relaxed 150 TMDL for Reaches 5 and 6 the 6 River (instead of the conventional 100
2 TMDL), upon construction of AWTF with MF/RO at SCVSD's Valencia Water

3 Reclamation Plant. The MOU further included a Recycled Water Agreement between the

4 District and Castaic Lake Water Agency ("CLWA"), predecessor of Real Party SCVWA,

5 to increase the amount of recycled water to be provided to CLWA, as well as the SCVSD's

6 support for CLWA's Recycled Water Program, including in obtaining grants and loans.

7 25. Petitioner is informed, and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the
8 2007-2008 MOU has not been revoked by the SCVSD or its Board of Directors.

9 26. On October 28, 2013, the SCVSD Board of Directors approved the Chloride
10 Compliance Facilities Project and certified its EIR ("2013 EIR"). The 2013 Chloride
J00|- DO HNEIRDIAR Y venue, obUeJE/ YUoN SIZ THE SILVERSTEI 11 Compliance Facilities Project included "Support for Municipal Reuse of Recycled Water"
POGL-LOLL6 VO 'euapesed 12 in all of its EIR Alternatives 1-4, to support CLWA's projected recycled water demands.

13 27. On or about July 7, 2014, the SCVSD Board voted to approve sewer rate
14 increases for a six-year period from fiscal year 2014-2015 through 2019-2020 in order to
15 help fund the construction of AWTF with MF/RO facilities, as contemplated in the 2008
16 MOU and subsequently in the 2013 EIR. The rate increases in the 2018-2019 fiscal year
and in the 2019-2020 17 would amount to about $83 more for the average family rate payer,

18 fiscal year, would amount to about $100 more for the average family rate payer. The
19 increased rates to non-residential properties, e.g., office, commercial and retail, is typically
20 substantially more.

21 28. On or about the same day of July 7, 2014, the SCVSD Board adopted a

22 resolution "Regarding the Sustainability of Water Resources and Development of

23 Opportunities to Use Recycled Water in the Santa Clarita Valley," reaffirming its 2008
24 MOU support to CLWA and other stakeholders in furtherance of recycled water plans

25 (2014 Recycled Water Resolution). The 2014 Recycled Water Resolution included
26 support to CLWA to obtain funding and facilitate recycled water project development.

27 The 2014 Recycled Water Resolution, along with SCVSD Board member and staff

attributing to Board Member Laurene Weste the following statement: "This project will
give us a source of very high quality recycled water that we can use to create local water
7 sustainability in the Santa Clarita Valley and help reduce our dependence on expensive

8 imported water."

APC loor 11 On or about February 23, 2016, the Los Angeles County Superior Court, the

POSL-LOLL6 VO Pasaden THE SILVERSTE North Marengo venue, ENEJPNMACY Hon. James C. Chalfant, ordered the setting aside and invalidation of the 2013 EIR, the
Chloride Compliance Facilities Project approvals, and further ordered SCVSD to refrain
12 from taking any steps to carry out the Chloride Compliance Facilities Project until and
13

14 unless SCVSD had fully complied with CEQA, all other applicable laws, and the

% accompanying writ. SCVSD has, since that time, falsely claimed that only parts of the
15 2013 EIR were invalidated; i.e., that the Recycled Water Project component was
16  invalidated but the Chloride Compliance component was upheld.

17 31.

18 On or about June 2, 2016, SCVSD requested that the Court modify and
issue a partial writ. The Court stated that SCVSD could file a motion for severance and
19 added: "Can you do that, sure. Are you going to win, I have no idea". SCVSD has never
20 moved for or sought a severance order to obtain such partial writ. The judgment and writ

21

22

23 that issued in the 2013 EIR litigation stated that there was complete invalidation of the

32.

24 2013 EIR and all related approvals. That judgment and writ stand unchanged.
In March 2016, SCVSD certified a Supplemental EIR ("2016 SEIR") to
address brine management (disposal of the by-product generated as a result of the AWTF's
25 reverse osmosis). Petitioner separately sued to invalidate SCVSD's 2016 SEIR, and the

26

27 2016 SEIR was subsequently invalidated.

3 attempted to sever out, i.e., piecemeal the recycled water component from the Chloride

4 Compliance Facilities Project.

5 35. On June 2, 2016, the Court, the Hon. James C. Chalfant, identified the

6 serious problem of "piecemealing" in violation of CEQA regarding SCVSD's attempt to
7 sever out recycled water from the Chloride Compliance Facilities Project, and informed

21 which incorporated and readopted the previously-invalidated 2013 EIR and 2016 SEIR,
22 both of which reaffirmed and restated that the provision of recycled water was an integral

23 part of the Chloride Compliance Facilities Plan. At the time of certification of the 2017
24 REIR, SCVSD repeatedly assured the public, other public agencies, and the decision

25 makers that SCVSD is committed to providing the recycled water it had previously assured
26 the public it was providing, that the District will pursue the recycled water component of

27 the Chloride Compliance Facilities Plan, but that its impacts were being reviewed under

2 District (as consented to by Newhall Land & Farming/FivePoint) signed a Joint Sewerage

3 Services Agreement ("JSSA"), as required by the 2002 Interconnection Agreement,

4 providing more details about SCVSD's sewage treatment of 6,000 dwelling units to be
built by Newhall Land & Farming/ FivePoint. Per the 2017 JSSA, Newhall Land &
6 Farming/FivePoint is to build an interim demineralization facility which "would take 5

7 treated effluent from the VWRP [SCVSD's Valencia Water Reclamation Plant] and
remove chlorides using advanced treatment (e.g., reverse osmosis). The removed chlorides
9 would be properly disposed of (see Section 5.34 for more details). The clean water would 8

10 be returned to the VWRP for reuse or discharge to the Santa Clara River."

+OSL-LOLL6 VO* Pasaden 100H pr& 'enuay oBuaJeW 4UON SIZ 12 JSSA has not been revoked, and remains operative.

EUSHENTIS 14 (represented by Newhall Land and Farming Company Limited Partnership and Newhall

15 Land and Farming LLC) entered into an Interim Demineralization Facility Operations
Agreement ("Demineralization Agreement"), based on which Newhall/FivePoint was to
17 build an Interim Demineralization Facility to remove chloride from sewage from its 16

18 developed 6,000 dwelling units before sending sewage to SCVSD's Valencia Water
19 Reclamation Plant's AWTF for further treatment. The Demineralization Facility was a
20 condition of approval of Newhall Ranch/FivePoint's Mission Village and Landmark

21 Village Vesting Tentative Tract Map.

Pasadena 14 44. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that CLWA's

15 (now SCVWA) commitments to provide all the required recycled water to Newhall
16 Ranch/FivePoint through SCVSD have been disguised and renamed under a separate "New

17 Drop" approach, which was proposed by SCVWA since 2019 as an alias for the
18 purportedly abandoned, but still continuing Recycled Water Project, for the purpose of
19 evading CEQA compliance for the Recycled Water Project.

18 50. The 2019 Resolution reaffirmed SCVSD's commitment to the recycled

20 Resolution. Yet, characterizing its 2019 Resolution as "Rejection of the Recycled Water 19 water plans and continued support to SCVWA that SCVSD had committed to in its 2014

1 is now pending before the Court and is related to prior cases concerning SCVSD's 2013

2 EIR, 2016 SEIR, and 2017 REIR.

52. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that after the 3

4 2019 Resolution, in 2019 and through the present, SCVSD has been implementing the

5 supposedly abandoned/rejected Recycled Water Project, including by constructing the

6 AWTF with MF/RO; yet SCVSD has inaccurately claimed that the A WTF with MF/RO is
7 being built solely for the purpose of the chloride compliance of the Chloride Compliance

54. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the high-
BLSHEATIS 3H1 14 quality recycled water produced by SCVSD's AWTF with MF/RO involves higher 13

15 operating and maintenance costs and is therefore more expensive than the recycled water

Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that SCVSD 16 produced by SCVSD before.

18 has committed to provide all or most of the A WTF-produced high-cost and high-quality
19 recycled water for use by developers, including by Newhall Land & Farming/FivePoint,

20 and not to put it into the River.

21 56. After the 2019 Resolution, in 2019 and through the present, SCVSD and
22 SCVWA have been installing major recycled water related infrastructure, including pumps,

23 tanks, pipes, and connections, in furtherance of SCVSD's Recycled Water Project,

24 including to convey recycled water to development projects such as Newhall Land &

4 recycled water from New Drop - produced from SCVSD's AWTF with MF/RO - will be

5 used for SCVWA's Phase 2 Projects and for Newhall Land & Farming/FivePoint's

7 59. After the 2019 Resolution, SCVSD and SCVWA have been holding regular
8 meetings with Newhall Land & Farming/FivePoint and the Santa Clarita Valley
9 Groundwater Sustainability Agency ("SCV-GSA") in furtherance of the Recycled Water

10 Project and related plans.
J00% 11 60. After the 2019 Resolution and continuing through the present, SCVSD has
THE SILVERSTEIN LAW wäld VOSL-LOLL6 12 applied for grants and received pass-through loans from SCVWA, in furtherance of the

8 215 North Marengo Avenue, 13 Recycled Water Project. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges,
Pasaden 14 that the pass-through loans from SCVWA to SCVSD were for the purposes of the
15 Recycled Water Project, but have been concealed and obscured, including by being
16 disbursed to SCVWA and subsequently passed through to SCVSD, where the accounting

17 of said loans has identified the grant recipient as "District No. 32" or "District No. 2",

18 rather than as "SCVSD".

19 61. On September 20, 2021, SCVSD approved a Subgrant Agreement with
20 SCVWA, whereby SCVSD agreed that SCVWA would receive and pass through to

21 SCVSD a $3,000,000 grant under Proposition 1, Round 1, for which SCVSD itself applied

22 and was approved.

23 62. Proposition 1, Round 1 final grant awards show that, along with SCVSD's
24  $3,000,000 grant award, SCVWA was also awarded $3,000,000 for its recycled water

25 pipeline extension project Phase 2C, which relies on the recycled water to be produced by
26 SCVSD's AWTF with MF/RO.

27 63. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that

28 SCVWA's grant awards for the recycled water projects (to convey the recycled water

2 awards for AWTF with MF/RO (to produce the recycled water for SCVWA's

4 64. The $3,000,000 grant to be received by SCVSD under the Subgrant

5 Agreement is for purposes of constructing or installing major equipment at SCVSD's
AWTF with MF/RO, as part of and in furtherance of the ongoing Recycled Water Project. 6

23 Paragraphs 1 through 68, inclusive, of this petition.

24 70. CEQA requires the lead agency to prepare and certify the completion of an

25 environmental impact report on any project it intends to carry out or approve that may have

3 CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental impacts

4 of projects. A "project" under CEQA is "the whole of an action" directly undertaken,

5 supported, or authorized by a public agency "which may cause either a direct physical

6 change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the

7 environment. Pub. Res. Code § 21065; CEQA Guidelines § 15378(a). CEQA requires that

8 environmental factors be considered at the "earliest possible stage . before [the project]

9 gains irreversible momentum" (Id. at 277), "at a point in the planning process where
genuine flexibility remains." Sundstrom v. Mendocino County (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d
296, 307. Conversely, CEQA forbids piecemealing; i.e., 66 6

72.

15

16 A project may have a significant impact under CEQA if it "will cause

17 substantial adverse effects on human beings, either directly or indirectly" or when the

18 "possible effects of a project are individually limited but cumulatively considerable." Pub.

19 Res. Code § 21083(b)(2)-(3). See also CEQA Guidelines § 15065(a)(3)-(4). In such cases,

20 the agency shall: (1) make a mandatory finding that the project may have a significant a
impact; and (2) shall prepare an EIR. Id.
73.

21

22 A project may have a significant impact under CEQA if it "has the potential

23 to ... substantially reduce the habitat of a fish or wildlife species; cause a fish or wildlife

24 population to drop below self-sustaining levels; threaten to a eliminate a plant or animal

25 community; substantially reduce the number or restrict the range of an endangered, rare or

prepare an EIR. Id.

28 Where the project may have significant impact listed under CEQA
Guidelines § 15065(a), the agency shall: (1) make a mandatory finding that the project a

7 Exemptions to CEQA are narrowly construed and "[e]xemption categories
are not to be expanded beyond the reasonable scope of their statutory language."
8 Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 125.

9 76. Exemptions from CEQA's requirements are to be construed narrowly in

THE SILVERST Pasader 14 applies. Save Our Carmel River v. Monterey Peninsula Water Management Dist. (2006)
141 Cal.App.4th 677, 697.

16 have a significant effect on the environment, an exemption would be improper." Wildlife

17 Alive v. Chickering (1976) 18 Cal.3d 190, 206.

18 78.

19 Even where exemptions apply, there are exceptions to the available
categorical exemptions from CEQA, including when the project at issue involves
20 cumulative impacts. CEQA provides that "All exemptions for these classes are

21 inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type
22 same place, over time is significant." CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2(b). in the

23 79. Guidelines Section 15301 sets forth, in pertinent part, the "Class 13

2 The key consideration is whether the project involves negligible or no expansion of an

3 80.

4 A project that changes the focus or use of a project site is not a minor

5 alteration under the Class exemption. County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water
Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 967 (project changing 17,000 acre feet of water from
6 irrigation to consumption was a change in focus not subject to existing facilities

7 exemption).

8 81.

9 SCVSD's approval of the Subgrant Agreement was "project" for purposes

10 of CEQA, since the installation of $3,000,000 of infrastructure is in furtherance of

APC WHH MVT 11 SCVSD's allegedly abandoned/rejected Recycled Water Project and may have significant

+OSL-LOLL6 215 North Marengo Avenue, 3" Floor 12 effects on the environment. However, those effects were not studied or approved with a

13 proper CEQA review document, much less any CEQA review document beyond SCVSD's

THE SILVERSTE 8
14 terse and unsupported assertion that the Subgrant Agreement project is categorically
Pasader exempt from CEQA.

15 82. Petitioner alleges that the Subgrant Agreement is a "project" as its enabled
16 $3,000,000 in grant funding involves a commitment by SCVSD to, and furthers, the

17 Recycled Water Project that may result in potentially significant physical impacts on the
18 environment.

19 83. Petitioner alleges that the Subgrant Agreement is a "project" for purposes of
20 CEQA as it is part

21 of the "whole of an action" taken in furtherance of the Recycled Water
Project and its encompassing Chloride Compliance Facilities Plan.

24 85.

5 Project furthered by the Subgrant Agreement may have significant adverse impacts on

6 human health and human beings, including by increasing the recycled water production
7 infrastructure at SCVSD's AWTF with MF/RO that will serve as a catalyst for rampant

8 urban development in what is currently primarily agricultural or undeveloped land,
9 including with attendant fire hazards and net depletion or deterioration of water supplies.

10 87. Petitioner alleges that the Subgrant Agreement may have significant impacts
APC WäI: MV1 Floor 11 on the environment and requires an EIR, as a matter of law, since the a Recycled Water

SILVERSTI 8 'euapesed 14 Land & Farming/FivePoint's and other developers' development projects relying on

E 15 SCVSD's Recycled Water Project and recycled water to be produced by the District's

16 AWTF with MF/RO.

17 88. Petitioner alleges that the Subgrant Agreement does not meet the definition

18 of a Categorical Exemption under Class 1 on its face, since the $3,000,000 grant funded
19 infrastructure to be installed from the Subgrant Agreement is major and far exceeds the

20 scope of "negligible or no expansion of existing or former use" "beyond that existing at the

21 time of the lead agency's determination" set by the Class 1 exemption, including as a result

22 of adding new physical infrastructure as of the time of SCVSD's exemption determination,

23 and thereby both enabling the production of additional amounts of recycled water, and for

24 new and different potable reuse purposes.

25 89. Petitioner further alleges that even if a Class 1 Categorical Exemption
26 applied, the Subgrant Agreement is excepted from the Categorical Exemption under Class

27 since the $3,000,000 grant funded infrastructure to be installed through the Subgrant
28 Agreement may have cumulatively considerable impacts, along with other successive

- projects of the same type and at the same place implemented by SCVSD, SCVWA, SCV-

2 GSA, Newhall Land & Farming/FivePoint, and others.

3 90. Petitioner further alleges that because the Subgrant Agreement will be

4 applied and used by SCVSD in a manner that will be a catalyst for more urban

5 development by developers, including Newhall Land & Farming/FivePoint, and including

6 in what is now mainly agricultural and undeveloped lands, it may have significant impacts

7 on the environment, including but not limited to growth-inducing, traffic, air quality, land

8 use, greenhouse gas emissions, open space, agricultural, biological, hydrologic (water),

9 geologic, seismic, aesthetic, energy, wildfire impacts, as well as impacts on population and
10  housing and public services, including police and fire.
APC WHld A J0O|: 11 91. Petitioner alleges that SCVSD's February 25, 2019 Resolution, which
POGL-LOL 12 provided the pretext for SCVSD's withdrawal of the NOP for the 2016 Recycled Water

18 such as trustee and resource gency Dept. of Fish & Wildlife, Petitioner ACWA, the
19 general public, and the environment.

20 92. CEQA requires public agencies: (1) to inform governmental decision

21 makers, other public agencies, and the public about the potential significant environmental

22 effects of proposed activities; (2) to identify ways that can avoid or significantly reduce

23 environmental damage; (3) to prevent significant avoidable damage to the environment by

2 failed to proceed in the manner required by law as SCVSD erroneously found that a Class

4 94. Petitioner further alleges that SCVSD violated CEQA by failing to support
