VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 1 -

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. This petition challenges the unlawful action of respondents and defendants The Regents of
3 the University of California ("Regents") and the University of California at Santa Cruz ("UCSC," and
4 collectively with the Regents, "respondents" or the "University") in approving the 2021 Long Range
5 Development Plan for the University of California Santa Cruz campus (*2021 LRDP" or "Project") and
6 all findings and related approvals purportedly supporting the 2021 LRDP approval, including the
7 University's approval of Mitigation Measures, a Statement of Overriding Considerations, and a
8 Mitigation Monitoring Program, and certification of the associated Final Environmental Impact Report
9 ("FEIR") and Notice of Determination ("NOD") for the 2021 LRDP (collectively, "Approvals"). The
10 University made those Approvals in violation of the requirements of the California Environmental
11 Quality Act, Public Resources Code.("PRC) section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA"), and in violation of the
12 University's contractual obligation to review "alternative locations to accommodate proposed UCSC
13 enrollment growth" prior to adopting the 2021 LRDP under the 2008 Comprehensive Settlement
14 Agreement ("CSA") by which the University is bound as a signatory. Don Stevens, et al. v. University of
15 California Santa Cruz, et al., Civ. Nos. CV 155583, et al., Judgment filed September 22, 2008, at.Exhibit
16 A thereto.

17 2. The University of California at Santa Cruz campus is situated in an extraordinary
18 environment whose deep, lush redwood forests give way to sweeping meadows overlooking Monterey
19 |Bay. This breath-taking setting hosts a vast array of sensitive plants and animals, and is blessed with
20 iconic landscapes and world-class vistas. To date, the campus has been carefully interwoven into the
21 natural fabric of its environment, sparing the most significant and sensitive natural features from
22 irreparable ecologic and scenic harm. Indeed, "commitment to environmental stewardship and
23 community engagement are central to the core values of UC Santa Cruz." UCSC, Campus Overview:
24 About UC Santa Cruz, available at: https://www.ucsc.edu/about/campus-overview.html(last accessed
25 March 4, 2021) ("Campus Overview").

26 3. However, that thoughtful balance is now threatened. The rapid and unsustainable growth
27 contemplated in the University's 2021 LRDP hints darkly of a jumbled, urban-style mega-campus
28 oblivious to the unique natural amenities of this site and the heuristic values they hold. While the

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 2 -

1 University is obliged to update its UCSC 2005 LRDP to address potential growth pressures, it must also
2 recognize the opportunities thus presented to identify, analyze and protect the vulnerable and
3 irreplaceable natural resources that inspired its founders to select this one-of-a-kind site for higher
4 |learning.

5 4. Yet, the 2021 LRDP's impacts exceed the University's disclosure, evaluation, and
6 mitigation of them. The 2021 LRDP would allow campus growth beyond what is necessary, and in
7 respects that needlessly generate impacts on water supply, traffic, housing and other critical pressure

8 lpoints in this campus' sharply resource-limited environment, to the irreparable detriment of the
9 surrounding environment and community. For example, the Santa Cruz campus is underlain by a
10 complex, unstable and readily erodible geologic formation known as "karst," which is "produced
11 primarily through the dissolving of rock" and features "sinkholes, caves, large springs, dry valleys and
12 sinking streams." DEIR Appendix B at HAWC's April 8, 2020 LRDP Scoping Comments, Exhibit 3, p.
13 11. Because of these features, karst landscapes pose unique hazards for surface development, and are
14 difficult to evaluate for potential use of the very limited and largely inaccessible pockets of groundwater
15 stored in them. Karst landscapes present numerous environmental uncertainties that make development
16 pursuant to the 2021 LRDP and its impacts especially problematic. Growth under the 2021 LRDP would
17 also damage spectacular and iconic landscapes and scenic treasures, unleash demands for off-campus
18 student housing that will drive up housing costs throughout the community, and pose burdens on local
19 traffic and exacerbate air pollution from the addition of over 9,000 new students and 3.1 million square
20 feet of facilities and infrastructure in an environment that cannot absorb and sustain their resource

.21 Idemands.

22 5. Despite these profound and pervasive adverse impacts on the Santa Cruz campus, the City
23 of Santa Cruz ("City"), and Santa Cruz County ("County"), respondents failed to perform essential
24 environmental analyses, thwarting informed public and agency review and comment. The FEIR (which
25 simply incorporates the DEIR with the addition of a new chapter 4 listing its revisions) fails to adequately
26 identify, analyze and provide for the plausible mitigation of the 2021 LRDP's significant adverse impacts
27 on this sensitive site's vulnerable resources, and instead accepts the cookie-cutter premise that the

28 campus will grow to the standard-issue UC campus size of about 28,000 students by the 2040-2041

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 3 -

- school year. DEIR at 1-3. It then trumpets its supposed need to "accommodate the increased campus
2 population" - as opposed to fairly examining off-campus, remote-learning and lower-growth options to

3 justify plans to construct "an additional 3.1 million assignable square feet of academic and support

4 building space." Id. The FEIR errs in presuming such unsustainable growth in the student population,
5 and in relying on that improvident growth to rationalize unnecessary campus expansion. Doing so omits

6 from public disclosure, scrutiny and comment the underlying and pivotal system-wide decision to allocate
7 substantial student and facility growth to the Santa Cruz campus rather than to other University branches
8 or other new facilities. Respondents' undisclosed and unquestioned assumption that rapid and excessive
9 |projected growth must be absorbed by UCSC, rather than-shifted to new off-campus or remote-learning
10 facilities or redistributed to other campuses, profoundly narrowed the scope of public and agency debate.
11 It sidestepped completely respondents' duty under CEQA and the CSA to examine a full range of
12 reasonable-alternatives to the dramatic growth in population proposed for the Santa Cruz campus.

13 6. The FEIR thus fails to fully analyze the Project's impacts, and consider a broad range of
14 |creative alternatives - including in particular those that encourage and nourish off-site learning - that
15 would avoid or lessen those impacts, as discussed-below. Because CEQA requires fact, not fiction, and
16 demands environmental accountability and a searching examination of less-impactful alternatives, the
17 FEIR violates CEQA. It must be revised to adequately consider the Project's impacts, and protect the
18 campus' place as "one of the most visually spectacular settings in higher education." Campus Overview.

19 7. Petitioners and plaintiffs Habitat and Watershed Caretakers, Don Stevens, Russell B.
20 Weisz, Hal Levin, Harry D. Huskey and Peter L. Scott (collectively, "petitioners") seek full
21 environmental disclosure, appropriately timed, placed and priced campus development, adherence to
22 the University's core commitment to public service, and protection of irreplaceable, world-class vistas,
23 vulnerable endangered species and scarce and overtapped water supplies.

24 8. Petitioners seek a writ of mandate setting aside, a declaration invalidating, and an
25 injunction forbidding implementation of, respondents' 2021 LRDP, FEIR, and associated Findings
26 regarding Impacts and Mitigation Measures, Mitigation Monitoring Program, and Statement of
27 Overriding Considerations, pending respondents' full compliance with CEQA.

28 9. In furtherance of these same goals, petitioners also seek to secure this Court's

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 4 -

1 interpretation of a key provision of the 2008 Comprehensive Settlement Agreement ("CSA") that defines
2 the permissible scope and rate of growth of the University of California at Santa Cruz. Petitioners seek to
3 lassure that respondents comply with the Judgment of this Court, per the Honorable Paul P. Burdick,
4 entered September 22, 2008 approving and requiring the parties' compliance with the CSA that resolved
litigation arising out of - and overturning - the University's approval of its 2005 Long Range
6 Development Plan ("2005 LRDP") for UCSC. Don Stevens, et al. v. University of California Santa Cruz,
7 et al., Civ. Nos. CV 155583, et al., Judgment filed September 22, 2008, at Exhibit A thereto. The
8 Judgment specifically retains this Court's jurisdiction over the signatories to the CSA "during the
9 duration of the [CSA] ... for purposes of resolving disputes that may arise in connection with the
10 interpretation or implementation of the [CSA]." Judgment at 3:2-5.

11 10. The CSA affirmatively commits the University to "include a comprehensive analysis of
12 potentially feasible alternative locations to accommodate proposed UCSC enrollment growth beyond that
13 analyzed in the 2005 LRDP EIR (i.e., satellite campuses, remote-classrooms, etc.) as a means of assessing
14 lUCSC's ability to meet the State Mandate for Higher Education while taking into consideration City of
15 Santa Cruz infrastructure including, but not limited to, transportation, water and housing" prior to
16 approving the 2021 LRDP. CSA § 5.1. The University failed to prepare any such comprehensive
17 analysis.

18 11. Petitioners Don Stevens, Russell B. Weisz, Hal Levin, Harry D. Huskey and Peter L. Scott
19 were signatories to the CSA. a They have a vital interest in the University's compliance with the CSA and
20 with this Court's Judgment requiring the parties' adherence to it.

21 12. The CSA was the culmination of several years of litigation and negotiation between
22 Ipetitioners, the University, the City, the County, vitally interested community groups including the Rural
23 Bonny Doon Association and the Coalition for Limiting University Expansion, and other concerned
24 |citizens. The CSA is the direct outgrowth of this Court's direction that the parties engage in a
25 constructive mediation following the Court's entry of rulings overturning the University's 2005 LRDP
26 due to its failure to adequately address the impacts of proposed expansion of the UCSC campus on traffic,
27 housing and water supplies. It represents the product of months of hard work by the parties to that
28 litigation to achieve a fair, balanced and constructive resolution of their differing interests and concerns

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 5 -

1  regarding how best to accommodate the University's long-term plans for development of UCSC while
2 recognizing and mitigating the impacts on traffic, housing, water supplies and sensitive coastal
lenvironmental resources. All of that work is threatened by this 2021 LRDP and the overly expansive
4 growth it allows.

5 13. Accordingly, petitioners seek:

6 (1) a writ of mandate setting asidethe 2021 LRDP and its Approvals, and an injunction forbidding
7 implementation of those Approvals, until such time as the University complies with CEQA;

8 (2) declaratory relief clarifying the University's obligations under the CSA, an injunction
9 requiring the University to comply with those provisions and an order commanding the University's
10 specific performance of its duties.

11 PARTIES

12 14. Petitioner HABITAT AND WATERSHED CARETAKERS ("HAWC") is a public
13 | interest citizens organization whose members reside within the County of Santa Cruz and use and enjoy
14  environmental resources that would be adversely impacted by the University's approval and
15 implementation of the 2021 LRDP. HAWC and its members actively participated in the administrative
16 proceedings that preceded the University's adoption of the Approvals. Their environmental, aesthetic,
17 /recreational, scenic, scientific, historic, cultural and community interests will, unless the relief requested
18 herein is granted, be adversely affected by the University's failure to comply with CEQA and the CSA in
19 approving the 2021 LRDP. The University's approval of the Project and its FEIR will harm HAWC and
20 its members because the Project will degrade extraordinary aesthetic resources, over-commit scarce
21 ground and surface water supplies to unnecessary growth, undermine UCSC's public-interest values, and
22 cause significant adverse environmental impacts to the public's use and enjoyment of UCSC lands,
23 waters, wildlife and scenery.

24 15. Petitioners DON STEVENS, RUSSELL B. WEISZ, HAL LEVIN, HARRY B. HUSKEY

25 and PETER L. SCOTT are concerned citizens and signatories to the 2008 CSA. They use and enjoy
26 environmental resources that are adversely impacted by the University's approval of campus development
27 and student growth that do not comply with CEQA and the CSA. They have performed all of their
28 obligations under the CSA and rely on the University to uphold its obligations as well. The University's

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 6 -

ongoing failure to acknowledge and comply with its duties under the CSA impairs their use and
2 enjoyment of the lands, waters, wildlife and scenery impacted by the University's rapid growth and
3 development. Their environmental, aesthetic, recreational, scenic, scientific, historic, cultural and
4 community interests will, unless the relief requested herein is granted, be adversely affected by the
5 University's failure to comply with CEQA and to complete a comprehensive analysis of alternative
6 locations to accommodate proposed UCSC enrollment growth beyond that analyzed in the 2005 LRDP
7 EIR before approving any major amendment to the 2005 LRDP, including the 2021 LRDP.

8 16. Petitioners availed themselves of all available administrative remedies to address the
9 University's violation of CEQA by commenting and objecting at every opportunity. They gave prior
10 motice of this proceeding to the University and the California Attorney General in accordance with
11 applicable law, as documented in Petitioners' Proof of Service of their Notice of Intent to File CEQA
12 Action and Notice to California Attorney General, respectively, filed concurrently herewith.

13 17. Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law within
14 the meaning of CCP section 1086, in that the University's approval of the Project is not otherwise
15 reviewable in a manner that provides an adequate remedy.

16 18. Respondent THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA owns and

17 |manages the Santa Cruz Campus of the University of California. The Regents have "full powers of
18 organization and governance" over the University of California, including tbe UCSC campus, under
19 Article IX, section 9, of the California Constitution. On August 15, 2008, former UCSC Chancellor
20 George Blumenthal approved the CSA on behalf of The Regents and UCSC. On or about September 30,
21 2021, The Regents, through its governing Board, approved the 2021 LRDP.

22 19. Respondent UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT SANTA CRUZ, or UCSC, is not an
23 independent legal entity separate from The Regents of the University of California. However, it was a
24 separately named party to the CSA, and is named as the "applicant" for the Project in the University's
25 2021 LRDP approval documents. For these reasons, it is independently named as a respondent in this
26 litigation.

27 20. The true names and capacities of Respondents DOES I-XX, inclusive, are unknown to
28 petitioners who therefore sue said Respondents by such fictitious names pursuant to CCP section 474.

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 7-

Petitioners will seek leave of Court to amend this Petition when the true names and capacities of said
2 DOE Respondents have been ascertained.

3 21. Real Parties in Interest CITY OF SANTA CRUZ and COUNTY OF SANTA CRUZ are
4 local governments that are signatories to the CSA and have an interest in its interpretation and
5 implementation.

6 22. Petitioners are not aware of any parties not already named as real parties in interest that
7 (possess a sufficient, specifically identifiable financial or other direct beneficial interest in the construction
8 and operation of the Project to qualify as real parties in interest in this proceeding. Out of an abundance
9 of.caution, petitioners name DOE Real Parties in Interest XXI-XXX, inclusive, who are potentially
10 financially interested in the construction and operation of the Project but are unknown to petitioners and
11 are therefore sued by such fictitious names pursuant to CCP-section 474. Petitioners will seek leave of
12 Court to amend this Petition if and when the true names and capacities of said DOE Real Parties in
13 Interest have been ascertained.

14 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

15 23. This Court has jurisdiction of this proceeding pursuant to CCP sections 1060, 1085, et
16 seq., PRC section 21168.5, and Article VI, section 10 of the California Constitution.

17 24. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to CCP sections 393 (actions against public
18 officers), and 395 (actions generally) because the University of California Santa Cruz is located within
19 this County.

20 25. This Petition is timely filed within 30 days (CEQA action per PRC section 21167) of the

21 City's filing of its Notice of Determination announcing its approval of the Project with the California
22 Office of Planning and Research on or about September 30, 2021, and three years (action upon a liability
23 created by statute per CCP section 338(a)) and four years (action for breach of written contract per CCP
24 section 337(a)) of the University's approval of the 2021 LRDP on or about September 30, 2021.

25

26 FACTS

27 26. The 2021 LRDP is a "physical development and land use plan to meet the academic and
28 institutional objectives for [UCSC]." PRC § 21080.09. "The LRDP is intended to aid the campus in

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT 8 -

F lachieving its education, research, and public service mission and goals while informing capital plans to
2 manage resource expenditures." 2021 LRDP at 17. The 2021 LRDP guides all development on the
3 UCSC campus, and therefore plays a pivotal role in shaping the future of the campus. Id.

4 27. As the LRDP acknowledges, this planning process "is also an opportunity to update
5 |campus strategies in an ever-changing world, to focus thinking around sustainable development and
6 resource conservation, and to enhance the resilience of the campus in the face of current and predicted
7 challenges." Id. But instead of updating strategies, focusing on sustainability, and rethinking goals to
8 enhance resilience, the 2021 LRDP continues down the same path of unbridled growth and development.

9 28. The 2021 LRDP assumes that UCSC will accommodate a projected student enrollment of
10 28,000 Full Time Equivalent ("FTE") students. Id. While the 2021 LRDP "does not mandate
11 development or growth," approval of the LRDP paves the way for that development to occur. Indeed, if
12 the LRDP did not assume that UCSC were obligated to accommodate : projected student enrollment of
13 28,000 FTE - and instead directed that growth elsewhere - such growth at the Santa Cruz campus would
14 not be permitted. By approving an LRDP that includes a horizon year of 2040 with a projected student
15 enrollment of over 9,000 more students than allowed under the previous LRDP, the 2021 ERDP
16 effectively grants a huge, and unnecessary, campus expansion. 2021 LRDP at 17,43.
17 29. In 2008, petitioners entered into the CSA with the University, UCSC, the City, the County
18 and other parties, following petitioners' successful challenge to the 2005 LRDP.
19 30. The CSA mandates "that the next major amendment to the 2005 LRDP ... include a
20 comprehensive analysis of potentially feasible alternative locations to accommodate proposed UCSC
21 enrollment growth beyond that analyzed in the 2005 LRDP EIR." CSA 5.1..

22 31. Such alternative locations already exist. For example, the University owns almost 1,100
23 acres in Marina that already have land use entitlements and infrastructure allowing their development as a
24 satellite campus. This off-campus alternative location for a satellite campus is thus potentially feasible.
25 Indeed, it appears that it could provide less expensive student housing with less environmental damage
26 than further expansion of the UCSC campus.

27 32. Rather than explore off-campus options, the University started exploring housing
28 development options on the campus and the Student Housing West ("SHW") Project was the result. The

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 9-

1 SHW Project would add approximately 3,000 student beds at two sites -- the Heller site and the Hagar site

2 on the UCSC campus, with construction originally proposed to commence in or after 2019. LRDP at
3 71. Construction has not yet commenced and is not anticipated until the winter or spring of 2022. Board
4 of Regents of the University of California, Finance and Capital Strategies Committee, March 17-18, 2021
5 Agenda Item F5 Staff Report, p. 7. That project is the subject of multiple ongoing legal challenges before
6 this Court.

7 33. On January 12, 2018 Chancellor Blumenthal announced his intent to expand the campus
8 by approximately 9,500 FTE students, to "28,000 students by 2040," "from the roughly 18,000 students
9 FUCSC] accommodate[s] today." Chancellor George Blumentbal, 2020 Long Range Development Plan
10 Update, January 12, 2018. The University's announced intention to expand the main campus population
11 by 9,500 students without first conducting a comprehensive analysis of the feasible alternatives to on-

12 campus growth such as satellite campuses and remote classrooms - conflicts with the requirement in
13 CSA section 5.1 for that analysis.

14 34. The University held public meetings regarding alternate visions for the 2021 LRDP in the
15 fall of 2019 and released its "Final Proposed Land Use Map" on December 2, 2019 without first
16 conducting a comprehensive analysis of potentially feasible alternative growth locations that CSA section
17 5.1 requires be completed before any major amendment of the 2005 LRDP may be adopted.

18 35. On February 25, 2020, the University released its Notice of Preparation for the 2020
19  LRDP Environmental Impact Report. On April 8, 2020, petitioners submitted scoping comments on that
20 LRDP.

21 36. In January 2021, the University released the Draft 2021 LRDP and related Draft
22 Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR"). It used the Final Proposed Land Use Map that was released on
23 December 2, 2019 and proposed housing 100 percent of all new students on the main campus rather than

24 considering alternatives to growth on the main campus such as satellite campuses. Petitioners submitted
25 comments on the DEIR on March 8, 2021.

26 37. The University released the FEIR in September 2021.

27 38. The Regents approved the 2021 LRDP, certified its FEIR, and adopted a Mitigation
28 Monitoring and Reporting Program, a Statement of Overriding Considerations, and Findings at its

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT 10 -

1 |regularly scheduled meeting on September 29-30, 2021. The Regents then submitted, and the Governor's
2 Office of Planning and Research posted, the Notice of Determination ("NOD") for the 2021 LRDP on
3 September 30, 2021.

4 39. The 2021 LRDP as approved would allow for on-campus "enrollment of 28,000 students,
5 which, if realized, would be an increase of 9,482 students over the 2018-19 baseline." NOD at 1. It
6 /would also authorize "[a]n additional 2,200 full time equivalent (FTE) on-campus faculty and staff . . . ,
7 for a total on-campus employee FTE projection of 5,000." NOD at 1. This increase by more than half of
8 existing on-campus faculty and staff will have a significant impact on the environment, and the
9 surrounding housing market. "The 2021 LRDP projects approximately 3 million gross square feet of
10 additional total campus space." NOD at 1.

11 40. Such a vast expansion of the campus would have numerous, significant impacts that could
12 not be mitigated to insignificance. The 2021 LRDP allows unbridled campus growth despite its
13 lexacerbation of the ongoing housing crisis in the area. The community around UCSC has traditionally
14 been a "very tight housing market, especially as it relates to rental housing." DEIR-at 3.13-5. The
15 "housing market is influenced by several factors, including proximity to major job-centers, low for-sale
16 inventory, and an "extremely tight" rental market." DEIR at 3.13-5. But only 25 percent of new
17 employees will be housed on campus, and no matter how much housing the campus provides, a
18 substantial percentage of students - approximately 50 percent based on the historical record of campus
19 housing - will still seek less expensive off-campus apartments. 2021 LRDP at 98.

20 41. Furthermore, expansion of the campus will have serious impacts to the karst system under
21 the campus. That fragile system is highly susceptible to impacts from drainage and contamination,
22 potentially leading to sinkholes and building collapse on campus. The spectacular views and open spaces
23 will likewise be burdened by new development and thousands more people. These impacts, and others,
24 are not adequately addressed in the EIR, yet The Regents still approved this illogical and unnecessary
25 (expansion.

26 42. The University's 2021 LRDP, and its environmental documents released during the
27 planning process, all fail to identify, let alone analyze, alternative off-campus locations to accommodate
28 student population growth such as the almost 1,100-acre property the University owns in Marina. As

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT 11 -

1 noted, that property already has land use entitlements and infrastructure allowing its development as a
2 satellite campus. But the EIR dismisses all but one off-campus alternative, violating its contractual duty

3 to provide - and the Superior Court's Judgment requiring - a comprehensive analysis of alternative
4 locations to accommodate growth. Indeed, the EIR dismisses all but one off-campus alternative on the
5 basis that it fails to meet the "objective of placing new facilities near existing facilities to enhance
6 synergies between existing and new educational and research programs." DEIR at 6-4 to 6-6. But there

7 1S more than one way to enhance synergy between new and existing educational resources. Restricting all
8 |alternatives to on-campus ones particularly in a post-pandemic time when it is now apparent how
9 successful remote learning can be - subverts CEQA's core purpose of exploring a reasonable-range of
10 alternatives to avoid and reduce environmental harm. Furthermore, it ignores the unique "opportunity [of
11 LRDP planning] to update campus strategies in an ever-changing world." 2021 LRDP at 17.

12 43. The University approved the 2021 LRDP - and thereby enabled and cleared the regulatory
13 path for unnecessary and unanalyzed on-campus enrollment growth - without first conducting the
14  *comprehensive analysis of potentially feasible alternative locations to accommodate proposed UCSC
15 enrollment growth" that section 5.1 of the CSA requires.

16 44. Rather than examine alternative housing locations such as the Marina site, the University
17 has prematurely narrowed its consideration of alternatives to those that are restricted exclusively to
18 expanding the existing main campus, contrary to the CSA's imperative that no major amendment to the
19 2005 LRDP be adopted until the University has first prepared a "comprehensive analysis of potentially
20 feasible alternative locations to accommodate proposed UCSC enrollment growth beyond that analyzed
21 in the 2005 LRDP EIR (i.e., satellite campuses, remote-classrooms, etc.)." CSA §5.1.

22 45. Because the EIR failed to adequately analyze the Project under CEQA, and because none
23 of the Project documents provide a comprehensive alternatives analysis as required under the CSA, the
24 University has abused its discretion and the 2021 LRDP Approvals must be set aside.

25 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

26 (CEQA)

27 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)

28 46. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT . 12 -

1 reference.

2 47. Respondents' actions in approving the 2021 LRDP, approving and certifying its EIR, and
3 making Findings and related approvals under CEQA constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion in that
4 respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and their decisions are not supported by
5 substantial evidence as follows:

6 Project Description

7 48. An adequate project description is an essential starting point for analysis of a project's
8 environmental impacts, and all environmental impact reports must provide one. 14 California Code of
9 Regulations ["CEQA Guidelines"] § 15124. As directed by the CEQA Guidelines, the project description
10 "shall contain . . .. A statement of objectives sought by the proposed project[, which] will help the Lead
11 |Agency develop a reasonable range of alternatives to evaluate in the EIR. ... The statement of
12  objectives should include the underlying purpose of the project." •CEQA Guidelines § 15124(b). It must
13 not be so narrow as to unduly constrain the consideration of alternatives to the project. North Coast
14 Rivers Alliance v. Kawamura ("North Coast') (2016) 243 Cal.App. 4th 647, 668-669. "An accurate,
15 stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an informative and legally sufficient EIR."
16 County of Inyo V. City of Los Angeles ("County of Inyo") (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 193.
17 49. The EIR provides an artificially narrow Project description that constrains the alternatives
18 [and impacts analysis in violation of CEQA. CEQA Guidelines § 15124(b); North Coast, 243 Cal.App.
19 4th at 668-669. It admits that the "overall objective of the 2021 LRDP is to guide the physical planning
20 and development of the plan area in support of the teaching, research, and public service missions of
21 [UCSC]." DEIR at 2-8. Yet the objectives discussed immediately thereafter require rapid student growth
22 despite its impacts on housing, traffic, water and other resource constraints, and ignore off-site
23 alternatives for growth including remote learning and off-campus facilities that would avoid or
24 accommodate those constraints. DEIR at 2-8 to 2-9. Such a narrowly constrained set of objectives
25 precludes any other outcome besides the proposed Project, thereby subverting CEQA's entire purpose.

26 50. The EIR's artificially narrow objectives require the University to "[e]xpand campus
27 facilities and infrastructure to allow for projected increases in student enrollment," "[e]nsure compact
28 and clustered development," create "two new college pairs at the main residential campus," and "allow

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT 13 -

the campus to function as a center of public cultural life." DEIR at 2-8 to 2-9. These objectives leave
2 no room for any proposal aside from the Project. And notably, they are not necessary to accomplish the
3 l"overall objectives" of the 2021 LRDP - UCSC's teaching, research, and public service missions.

4 51. UCSC's public service mission is especially important here, because UCSC specifically
5 prides itself on its "uncommon commitment to .. public service." UCSC, Campus Overview: About UC
6 |Santa Cruz, available at: https://www.ucsc.edu/about/campus-overview.html(last accessed March 4,
7 2021). The EIR fails to ensure that all aspects of UCSC's mission are valued and considered when
8 defining the Project's objectives. This vital publié service mission is almost entirely overlooked in order

9 Ito promote campus growth. DEIR at 2-8 to 2-9. The LRDP "anticipates potential enrollment of

10 |28,000 [full-time equivalent "FTE"] students (three-quarter average) by the 2040-2041 academic year,"
11 and plans to construct "an additional 3.1 million assignable square feet of academic and support building
12 space" to "accommodate the increased campus population." DEIR at 1-3; NOD at 1. This reflexive
13 obeisance to the premise of rapid campus growth precludes the careful and detailed consideration of less
14 impactful alternatives that CEQA: demands.

15 52. The 2021 LRDP claims that it "does not mandate development or growth, nor is it a
16 commitment to a specific enrollment level or pace of growth," but then commits to providing for up to
17 28,000 FTE students. DEIR at 1-3. The Project may not mandate such growth, but it certainly authorizes
18 that growth, and does so based on the erroneous premise that such growth is necessary. It asserts that the
19 proposed 28,000 student assumption is "based on overall UC and campus population projections,
20 demonstrated need for additional public university capacity in California, and an understanding of
21 |campus needs." DEIR at 2-9. This reasoning stands CEQA on its head by allowing the "growth
22 projection" tail to wag the environmental planning dog. If growth on the UCSC campus occurs, it will be
23 because the University allows it. The EIR's framing of student enrollment growth as an unstoppable
24 force that it must accommodate infects the entire EIR, starting with the Project description.

25 53. Indeed, the "growth projection" tail is directing the scope of the entire 2021 LRDP.
26 Unlike past LRDPs - which were effective for set periods of time - the proposed 2021 LRDP is effective
27 for as long as it takes to reach the ultimate goal of 28,000 FTE students. DBIR at 1-3. "[T]he 2021
28 LRDP does not sunset, and there is no set timeframe for when a new LRDP would be needed. However,

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 14 -

1 for analytical purposes, [the EIR] assumes that the forecasted student and faculty/staff growth would
2 occur by the 2040-2041 academic year, along with development of related facilities and housing." DEIR
3 at 1-3; LRDP at 17. But this change in scope is not warranted, and it unduly places growth objectives
4 above all other important educational goals, including public service and environmental protection and
5 sustainability.

6 54. In summary, the EIR prematurely commits and subordinates the LRDP to the rapid and
7 unsustainable "anticipated growth in on-campus student population from an estimated 18,518 FTE
8 students (three-quarter average) for the 2018-2019 academic year to a potential enrollment of 28,000
9 FTE students (three-quarter average) by the 2040-2041 academie year." DEIR at 2-9; LRDP 95. This
10 lembedded premise that rapid on-campus growth is unavoidable because it is pre-ordained in the
11 University's "growth projection" defeats the entire purpose of the long-range planning process. It is akin
12 to announcing the winner of a race before the starting gun is fired. It subverts UCSC's public service
13 commitment and renders the CEQA process a hollow exercise. It must not be allowed to constrain the
14 EIR's statement of objectives.

15 Environmental Setting

16 55. Normally, the "EIR must include a description of the physical environmental conditions in
17 the vicinity of the project . .. as they exist at the time the notice of preparation is published." CEQA
18 Guidelines § 15125(a) (emphasis added). However, this required description of the existing physical
19 conditions does not include facilities that are not yet, and may never be, built because their approval is
20 currently under judicial review. The Student Housing West Project is such a facility that has not been,
21 and may never be, built because of ongoing judicial reviews. Its original approval was vacated by the
22 Santa Cruz County Superior Court on October 30, 2020, and indeed, additional challenges to its legality
23 remain pending - one on appeal and one in Superior Court. The SHW Project's more recent approvals
24 lare also being challenged in this Court. Yet the EIR indulges the fiction that this unconstructed project
25 Iwhose approval is in doubt has already been built and is thus included within the FEIR's description of
26 the existing environmental setting. Indeed, the EIR admits that the SHW Project approvals were
27 overturned by the Superior Court, and that it cannot proceed without a valid and legal reapproval. DEIR
28 at 3.13-7. Therefore, it must not be included in the FEIR's baseline conditions. Rather, and as required

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 15 -

-

by Guidelines section 15125(a), the environmental setting should describe the campus as it now exists,
2 with sweeping ocean views and untrammeled open spaces, including most prominently, its iconic East
3 Meadow without this unbuilt development. But the EIR fails to abide by this mandate, and instead
4 presumes the existence of a project that has not been and may never be constructed and is being
5 challenged in the Superior Court - as if the Judicial Branch does not exist.

6 56. In an apparent attempt to mask the fact that the Student Housing West Project has not yet
7 been built and is still in serious question, and thus this project is not part of the environmental setting, the
8 EIR also refers to the SHW Project as a cumulative project. DEIR at 3.13-7, 4-3. But this project is
9 never actually analyzed as a cumulative project. Instead, this reference is in name oaly: Rather, the SHW
10 Project is discussed throughout the environmental setting section of the EIR as if it were already part of
11 the existing environment, and the student beds it might have provided had it been lawfully approved are
12 /presumed to already exist in the EIR's discussion of impacts. DEIR at 3.6-12, 3.10-29, 3.13-2, 3.13-7,.
13 3.16-34.

14 57. The overlap in the planning process between the 2021 LRDP and the SHW Project
15 provided an opportunity to shape campus growth and development in a sustainable, and productive
16 Imanner. Instead, the LRDP committee was prohibited from even discussing the SHW Project and related
17 land use designation changes during the LRDP planning process. Indeed, the "LRDP committee was told
18 explicitly that we were not allowed to discuss this change in land use designation in the [2021] LRDP
19 committee meetings. It [is] disingenuous for the campus to be in the midst of what is supposed to be a
20 participatory, 2-yr comprehensive land planning process and not include [SHW] as part of it." Karen
21 Holl, Professor of Environmental Studies, Restoration Ecologist, Comments on the Revised Student
22 |Housing West Project Draft EIR, October 25, 2018; See also FEIR Appendix A, Comment 05-5 ("At the
23 LRDP Advisory Committee meetings last Spring, discussion of [SHW] was arbitrarily forbidden").

24 58. The EIR's erroneous premise that the SHW Project is already built is particularly marked
25 in the EIR's discussion of Project alternatives. As further discussed below, the no project alternative
26 mistakenly includes the SHW Project. DEIR at 6-10. But the SHW Project is not built and therefore
27 cannot be considered an existing condition that is already present. The disconnect between the EIR's
28 conflicting claims that this project is a "cumulative project" yet subject to "baseline" treatment is at best

1VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 16 -

1 confusing and at worst, a contrived fiction to evade required CEQA review.

2 Alternatives

3 59. CEQA requires an EIR to describe a reasonable range of alternatives that could feasibly
4 attain most of the basic objectives of the project while avoiding or substantially lessening any of its

5 significant effects. CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6(a) and (f). "An EIR's discussion of alternatives must

6 contain analysis sufficient to allow informed decision making." Laurel Heights Improvement Association
7 v. Regents of the University of California ("Laurel. Heights") (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 404. An alternative
8 may "not be eliminated from consideration solely because. it would impede to some extent the attainment
9 of the project's objectives." Habitat and Watershed Caretakers v. City of Santa Cruz ("HAWC") (2013)
10 213 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1304; CEQA Guidelines § 15126.6(b). "The EIR is required to make an in-depth
11 discussion of those alternatives identified as at least potentially feasible." HAWC, 213 Cal.App.4th at
12 1303 (emphasis and quotation omitted).

13 .60. As discussed above, protecting UCSC's unique environment and advancing its public
14 service mission are central objectives to the University and thus must be achieved in the 2021 LRDP.
15. Therefore, the EIR should have considered alternatives that feasibly provide for the accomplishment of
16 those objectives. Alternatives that temper on-campus population growth in order to protect the campus's
17 extraordinary environment must be given full consideration, as CEQA directs that "[t]he range of
18 potential alternatives to the proposed project shall include those that could feasibly accomplish most of
19 the basic objectives of the project." CEQA Guidelines §15126.6(c). Limiting FTE on-campus student
20 enrollment will allow UCSC to put more resources toward education and research for its students, while
21 at the same time achieving its public service and environmental preservation objectives.

22 61. Yet, not a single one of the EIR's alternatives considered shifting some student growth to
23 other UC campuses that have greater carrying capacities, such as greater water supplies and fewer
24 environmental impacts and constraints. DEIR at 6-3 to 6-6. While two alternatives did consider a
25 proposed enrollment of 26,400 FTE, a mere 1,600 students less than the proposed Project, the resulting
26 increase in campus population by nearly 8,000 students would still amount to an unnecessary and
27 excessive expansion that would entail construction of 2.5 million assignable square feet of academic and
28 administrative facilities. DEIR at 6-11, 6-13, 6-17. Such intense a growth on a site constrained by

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 17 -

1 linsufficient water, housing and transportation, and hosting vulnerable and irreplaceable environmental
2 resource, must be weighed against an alternative that shifts substantial growth elsewhere, such as other
3 off-site locations and campuses that have the space and the resources to expand. Instead of assuming that
4 UCSC's on-campus student population must be expanded, and keep expanding, to accommodate more
5 and more students on a campus that cannot support that growth, the FEIR should consider alternatives
6 that explore off-campus alternatives and limit UCSC's on-campus growth to a much more sustainable
7 population.

8 62. Indeed, the University is contractually obliged to conduct a "comprehensive analysis of
9 potentially feasible alternative locations to accommodate proposed UCSC enrollment growth" including
10 "satellite campuses [and] remote-classrooms,' as further discussed below. That obligation is a key term
11 of the CSA between the University and petitioners, at section 5.1. But the EIR summarily dismisses all
12 but one of those alternatives, violating its contractual duty to provide - and the Superior Court's
13. Judgment requiring - a comprehensive analysis of alternative locations to accommodate growth. DEIR at

14 6-3 to 6-6.

15 63. Based on a single perfunctory and conclusory paragraph each, the EIR dismisses four off-
16 [campus site alternatives, and one remote/distance alternative, on the erroneous premise that they do not
17 meet the project objectives. DEIR at 6-3 to 6-6. But as discussed above, CEQA requires consideration of
18 alternatives that "are capable of avoiding or substantially lessening any significant effects of the project,
19 even if these alternatives would impede, to some degree, the attainment of the project objectives." CEQA
20 Guidelines § 15126.6(b); HAWC, 213 Cal.App.4th at 1304; CEQA Guidelines §§ 15124(a), 15126.6(c).
21 Indeed, the EIR dismisses every off-campus alternative on the basis that it fails to meet the "objective of
22 placing new facilities near existing facilities to enhance synergies between existing and new educational
23 land research programs." DEIR at 6-4 to 6-6. But there is more than one way to enhance synergy between
24 new and existing educational resources. Restricting all alternatives to on-campus ones subverts CEQA's
25 |core purpose of exploring a reasonable range of alternatives to avoid and reduce environmental harm.

26 64. UCSC has an unprecedented opportunity to analyze the on-site challenges, and remote
27 learning alternatives, that the world is facing during the ongoing pandemic, and utilize some of the new
28 Iprocedures and practices to its benefit. See 2021 LRDP at 17. A distance learning alternative would

|VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT . 18 -

P alleviate many of the potential effects of campus growth, including water and transportation impacts,
2 while still enabling sustainable growth and public service, and potentially opening up enrollment to
3 students who may not have been able to attend otherwise. And, as noted, "comprehensive" consideration
4 of this alternative is already required under the CSA the University executed with petitioners in 2008.
5 The EIR's cursory dismissal of this alternative violates CEQA. DEIR at 6-6.

6 65. The EIR also fails to consider an alternative "tbat could avoid or lessen the significant
7 environmental impact of [campus expansion] on the [City of Santa Cruz's] water supply." HAWC, 213
8 Cal.App.4th at 1305. As discussed below, UCSC relies on the City for its water supply and that water
9 supply is "anticipated [to have] shortfalls under drought conditions." UC Santa Cruz LRDP 2005-2020
10- ("2005 LRDP"), 88; DEIR at 3.17-24. While UCSC did reduce its water use after 2005, it has been
11 increasing again since 2014. And the City expects the demand for water to exceed supplies by 2025.
12 DEIR Appendix B at HAWC's April 8, 2020 Scoping Comments, Exhibit 1, pp. 4-6, 6-24. The 2021
13  LRDP tries to gloss over this major impediment in a single sentence, stating that the City's "water
14 supplies are limited and have been key driver for increased water conservation on campus." 2021
15 LRDP at 149. But none of that changes the fact that the City does not, and will not, have enough water
16 for this type of expansion during drought years. Because UCSC campus growth will necessarily increase
17 Iwater demand, the EIR must consider an alternative that reduces that impact on the City's water supply.
18 DEIR at 3.17-19 to 3.17-21. Its failure to do so violates CEQA.

19 66. The EIR's no project alternative likewise violates CEQA. As discussed, the SHW Project
20 lis not currently constructed, and may never be built. As noted, the SHW approvals are currently being
2.1 challenged in Superior Court. DEIR at 3.13-7. Yet this speculative project is presumed constructed
22 under Alternative 1- the no project alternative. DEIR at 6-10. "The no-project analysis is required to
23 discuss 'the existing conditions at the time the notice of preparation is published . as well as what
24 would be reasonably expected to occur In the foreseeable future if the project were not approved." DEIR
25 at 6-7. But the SHW Project is not built, and is the subject of litigation making its future uncertain. Its
26 inclusion in the no project alternative despite the additional legal challenges still pending, ignores the
27 proper role of the courts in enforcing CEQA's mandate, and therefore violates CEQA. CEQA Guidelines
28 |§ 15126.6(e)(2).

|VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT • 19 -

1 Impacts and Mitigation Measures

2 67. CEQA mandates that the EIR adequately analyze a project's effects to foster informed
3 decisionmaking and allow the public to understand those impacts. PRC § 21002.1; CEQA Guidelines §§
4 15121, 15126, 15126.2. Where possible, the lead agency must employ feasible mitigation measures that
5 could minimize the project's significant adverse impacts. PRC § 21002; CEQA Guidelines §§ 15121,
6 15126.4. The EIR must provide information in "an analytically complete and coherent" manner to foster
7 CEQA's informational purpose.. Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Rancho
8 Cordova ("Vineyard") (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 440; Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay Committee v. Board
9 Port of Commissioners (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1355-1356; CEQA Guidelines § § 15121, 15144.
10 Yet, the EIR failed to adequately discuss and mitigate the Project's impacts in at least the following nine
11 ways.

12 Aesthetics

13 68. "The visual character of the campus is defined initially by its spectacular natural
14 environment of open meadow spaces, coastal oak forests and redwood groves." DEIR at 3.1-10. "The
15 |campus enjoys panoramic views overlooking the Monterey Bay and the Pacific Ocean." LRDP at 51.
16 "The 1963 UCSC LRDP noted the unmatched natural beauty of the site and the importance of both
17 respecting and celebrating this beauty over the life of the campus." LRDP at 89. According to the 2005
18 LRDP, the campus site was selected because it was "overlooking Santa Cruz and the Monterey Bay. . ..
19 Often called the most spectacular university site in the world, the campus landscape has played a vital
20 role in shaping UCSC's physical and academic development." 2005 LRDP at 16. "The natural landscape
21 is the formative, iconic element of the UCSC campus and the dominant component of its powerful array
22 of open spaces." 2005 LRDP, 33.

23 69. Rather than ensure that these "vital,"spectacular" and "iconic" landscapes and views are
24 preserved and protected by the 2021 LRDP, the EIR brushes potential impacts aside and declares that the
25 addition of over 9,000 new students and 3.1 million square feet of facilities and infrastructure will not

26 have a significant affect on any scenic views. DEIR at 3.1-38 to 3.1-39.

27 70. For example, while the 2021 LRDP acknowledges the significance of the currently
28 untrammeled East Meadow in "providing an incomparable natural setting" (id. at 16), the EIR

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT 20 -

erroneously claims the SHW Project is part of the existing setting and consequently fails to address its
2 significant aesthetic impacts on the East Meadow, where iconic, sweeping views of the ocean across this
3 expansive natural greenway will be degraded or destroyed. The EIR must discuss the site as it exists
4 today, and analyze the impacts that the Project - including the SHW Project that the 2021 LRDP
5 presumes will be constructed - will actually have.

6 71. Similarly, the EIR fails to identify and discuss the impacts of the cryptically referenced
7 "enhanced historic district at the entrance to the main residential campus" (DEIR at 2-9) on the current
8 views of the "incomparable" East Meadow. FEIR 2-272 (declining to reveal the particulars of the
9 | "enhanced" development and instead listing numerous features that may be included). The EIR's failure
10 | to evaluate these impacts, and to analyze alternatives and mitigation measures that would avoid or reduce
11 them, prevents informed decisionmaking by the public and the University. Because the EIR fails to
12 address the Project's significant aesthetic impacts, these extraordinary and irreplaceable scenic resources
13 are at serious risk of needless irreparable degradation and loss due to contemplated, but unstudied,
14 campus growth.

15 Biological Resources

16 72. In the past, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service ("USFWS") has noted that "[t]he
17 piecemeal approach that UCSC has taken in terms of implementing individual development projects over
18 time makes it difficult for the Service to adequately assess cumulative impacts." DEIR Appendix B at
19 |HAWC'S April 8, 2020 Scoping Comments, Exhibit 2, p. 2. USFWS also expressed similar concerns
20 about the 2005 LRDP DEIR, "includ[ing] the following: "1) underestimating the effects of various
21 development projects on federally listed species, 2) [inadequate] UCSC land use designations regarding
22 |conservation of federally listed species, and 3) the lack of a comprehensive management plan for listed
23 species at UCSC.31 DEIR Appendix B at HAWC's April 8, 2020 Scoping Comments, Exhibit 2, p. 2
24 (citing USFWS January 11, 2006 comment letter to UCSC on the 2005 LRDP DEIR).

25 73. These same concerns apply to the 2021 LRDP EIR. Because the EIR fails to fully address
26 the cumulative and indirect habitat impacts from all the development that the LRDP would allow over its
27 Life, those impacts will be hidden within piecemealed, individual project assessments. Thus buried from
28 public and agency view, those impacts may never be recognized - certainly not cumulatively - leaving

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 21 -

1 USFWS, the City and County, other agencies, and the public without a clear and complete understanding
2 of the LRDP's cumulative and indirect biological impacts.

3 74. An agency must review the entire activity - in this case, the LRDP over its entire life - as
4 la whole, rather than segment it into smaller parts. Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth,
5 Inc. v. City of Sonora (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1230; Laurel Heights Improvement Association v.

6 UC Regents (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 406; CEQA Guidelines § 15378(a), (c), (d). Because UCSC campus
7 development has the potential, over the course of the LRDP's implementation, to significantly impact a
8 long list of vital and vulnerable biological resources, the EIR must address all of those potential impacts,
9 both short-term and long-term, now -when the go/no-go long-range planning decision is made - and
10 before any further development may be allowed to proceed. But the EIR defers all surveys, studies,
11 plans, and avoidance measures to project-specific analyses. DEIR at 3.5-39 to 3.5-70. The failure to
12 consider these impacts as a whole diminishes their perceived significance, and ignores the impacts at the
13 critical planning stage when the ability to avoid or mitigate those impacts is greatest, thereby preventing
14 informed decisisonmaking in violation of CEQA.

15 75. Like the EIR's other sections, its biological resources analysis entirely fails to include a
16 |discussion of the SHW Project. As noted, that project's initial approval was set aside, its reapporval has
17 been challenged, and accordingly it has not been constructed. Therefore it is not part of the existing
18 environment. If it is eventually constructed, it will have significant impacts on biological resources. Yet
19 the EIR treats it as part of the existing setting, allowing this highly impactful project to evade CEQA
20 examination of its cumulative impacts together with the impacts of the other development proposed under
21 the 2021 LRDP, in violation of CEQA.

22 Greenhouse Gas Emissions

23 76. As the "physical development and land use plan to meet the academic and institutional
24 lobjectives,' the 2021 LRDP has the potential to significantly affect greenhouse gas.("GHG") emissions
25 on campus. DEIR at 1-1. Indeed, "the 2021 LRDP would result in a net increase in campus-wide GHG
26 lemissions caused by additional construction activity; on-road VMT [vehicle miles traveled]; building
27 energy consumption; water, waste, and wastewater emissions; and additional stationary source
28 emissions." DEIR at 3.8-21. But the EIR fails to adequately analyze and mitigate that significant impact.

|VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT • 22 -

1 77. The EIR admits that the quantity of GHG "emissions that has accumulated in the
2 atmosphere is enormous and has resulted in climate change, which is a significant cumulative impact."
3 DEIR at 4-30. But the EIR still limits its analysis to the impacts in and around the UCSC campus only.
4 DEIR at 3.8-21 to 3.8-27. GHG emissions are not confined by the borders of the University, or the City.
5 GHG emissions by UCSC have the potential to impact much more than just the campus and the City, and
6 those cumulative impacts cannot be ignored. As the EIR states, "[b]ecause climate change is a global
7 phenomenon, the impacts of GHG emissions are inherently cumulative," and must be analyzed on a.
8 regional level. DEIR at 4-30. Because the EIR's GHG emissions analysis fails to provide that regional
9 (and global) evaluation, it violates CEQA.

10 78. Under CEQA, GHG emissions must also be analyzed in a manner that recognizes the
11 entirety of the project's "lifecycle" impact, including the emissions from the mining and gathering,
12  cultivation and harvest, and manufacturing of the project's components, their fabrication, their
13 transportation to the site, the on-site grading and construction of the project, and its long-term operation
14 and ultimate decommissioning. This comprehensive review of project's GHG emissions, widely known
15 as a lifecycle analysis, is required by CEQA but never completed for the EIR. DEIR 3.8-21 to 3.8-27.
16 The EIR must provide a lifecycle analysis of all development that is allowed under the LRDP. Such an
17 analysis would provide a more accurate and complete understanding of the Project's GHG emissions and
18 their impact on the environment. Without such an analysis, the public and decisionmakers are left in the
19 dark about the Project's true GHG impacts.

20 Hydrology and Water Quality

21 79. Campus development under the 2021 LRDP will necessarily impact the site's hydrology
22 and water quality. The campus is underlain by extremely complex and readily erodible geologic
23 formations known as "karst," as hydrologist and karst specialist Tom Aley explained in his comments on
24 the DEIR. FEIR Appendix A at HAWC's March 8, 2021 DEIR Comments (Comment Letter 07),
25 Exhibit 1 (Comments 07-31 to 07-41). Mr. Aley was recognized as the premier karst expert by Weber
26 & Associates, the Santa Cruz campus' hydrogeological consultants, and was paid directly by UCSC for
27 his past research and reports. Mr. Aley's previous analysis, including his 1994 paper with Weber &

1 EIR's analysis. But as discussed below, the EIR ignores Mr. Aley's findings because they conclude,
2 contrary to the premise of the 2021 LRDP, that the karst formation cannot support the projected campus
3 growth.

4 80. The karst system is a landform that is "produced primarily through the dissolving of rock"
5 and features "sinkholes, caves, large springs, dry valleys and sinking streams." DEIR Appendix B at
HAWC's April 8, 2020 Scoping Comments, Exhibit 3, p. 11. Because of these features, karst landscapes
7 pose unique hazards for surface development, and are very difficult to evaluate for potential use of
8 groundwater stored in them. "In karst areas, water commonly drains rapidly into the subsurface at zones
9.. of recharge and then through a network of fractures, partings, and caves, [and] emerges at the surface in
10 zones of discharge at springs, seeps, and wells." Id.; FEIR Appendix A at HAWC's March 8, 2021 DEIR
11. Comments (Comment Letter 07), Exhibit (Comments 07-31 to 07-33, 07-40 to 07-41).

12 81. Karst landscapes present numerous environmental uncertainties that make-development
13 pursuant to the 2021 LRDP and its impacts especially problematic. "Karst regions require special care to
14 lprevent contamination of vulnerable groundwater supplies and to avoid building in geologically
15 hazardous areas." DEIR Appendix B at HAWC'S April 8, 2020 Scoping Comments, Exhibit 3, p. 7.
16 "Most of the rain that falls in a karst area drains into the ground rather than flowing to a surface stream."
17 DEIR Appendix B at HAWC's April 8, 2020 Scoping Comments, Exhibit 3, p. 28. Development
18 allowed under the 2021 LRDP, such as construction of the SHW Project, can increase "pollution of
19 groundwater by sewage, runoff containing petrochemicals derived from paved areas, domestic and
20 industrial chemicals, and trash." DEIR Appendix B at HAWC's April 8, 2020 Scoping Comments,
21 | Exhibit 3, p. 7. "Contamination is common in karst aquifers beneath urban areas with high population
22 densities." DEIR Appendix B at HAWC's April 8, 2020 Scoping Comments, Exhibit 3, p. 30.

23 82. Despite all of these perils and uncertainties, the EIR makes assumptions about the karst
24 aquifer and its availability for groundwater storage and pumping that ignore its inherent unsuitability for
25 development and vulnerability to contamination and dewatering. FEIR Appendix A at HAWC's March
26 8, 2021 DEIR Comments (Comment Letter 07), Exhibit 1 (Comments 07-35 to 07-40). For example,
27 the EIR makes baseless assumptions that overstate the groundwater storage capacity of the karst aquifer
28 lin order to sidestep hard questions about providing an adequate year-round water supply for the 2021

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 24 -

1 LRDP's rapid growth should the University be unable to secure adequate water supplies from the City.
2 The City has already concluded, as noted, that it will face water shortages by 2025. "While human
3 demands for water on the University campus with a dramatically enlarged population will be relatively
4 constant, the key issue is the adequacy of groundwater from the karst aquifer under dry weather
5 conditions." FEIR Appendix A at HAWC's March 8, 2021 DEIR Comments (Comment Letter 07),
6 Exhibit 1 (Comment 07-34). But rather than analyzing the impact of pumping groundwater during dry
7 periods when water supplies are limited, the EIR erroneously bases its analysis on a groundwater
8 pumping study that was conducted when the karst formation's discharges to down gradient springs and
9 - creeks were 15 times greater than those watercourses' minimum flows. FEIR Appendix A at HAWC's
10 March 8, 2021 DEIR Comments (Comment Letter 07), Exhibit 1 (Comment 07-38).

11 83. As karst expert Mr. Aley explains in his analysis that petitioners submitted as an
12 attachment to their DEIR comments, "UCSC failed to collect adequate spring flow data during the period
13 1984 through.2019. As a result, the University has no credible estimate of the rates at which water has
14 been discharged from the karst aquifer during this 35 year period and how rapidly water that enters the
15 aquifer is discharged through the springs." FEIR Appendix A at HAWC's March 8, 2021 DEIR
16 Comments (Comment Letter O7), Exhibit 1 (Comment 07-36). UCSC contends that pumping water
17 |from these aquifers may fill any deficit in water supply during dry years, but the karst system may not
18 support the "H3,700 gallons per day ... projected demand.» FEIR Appendix A at HAWC's March 8,
19 2021 DEIR Comments (Comment Letter 07), Exhibit (Comment 07-36). "An adequately
20 comprehensive network of monitoring wells for routinely measuring water level elevations is key part
21 of understanding and managing groundwater basins," but the EIR entirely failed to conduct adequate
22 hydrologic investigations. FEIR. Appendix A at HAWC's March 8, 2021 DEIR Comments (Comment
23 Letter 07), Exhibit 1 (Comment 07-37); DEIR 3.10-20, 3.10-24. Indeed, there are only 4 wells on
24 campus and three are located within approximately 40 feet of one another. Id. More information is
25 Ineeded to assure informed decisionmaking by the public and the University.

26 84. And the information and conclusions that the EIR has supposedly drawn from those wells
27 are not supported by the evidence gathered and analyzed by Mr. Aley. For example, the EIR concludes
28 that pumping groundwater from WSW#1 is unlikely to affect individual springs because it is

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 25 -

*

"hydraulically connected to major portions of the karst aquifer:." FEIR at 4-45; DEIR at 3.10-25. But the
2 study on which UCSC based its conclusion - a study by geohydrologist Aley - was conducted to assess
3 the potential impacts on down gradient springs of utilizing well WSW#I merely to supply a greenhouse
4 land perhaps some outside plants in the vicinity of the greenhouse, a level of use amounting to a mere 62
5 gallons per day -- one fourth the usage of an average household. DEIR at 3.17-20. As Mr. Aley explained
6 in his comments on the LRDP, his 1994 report "should not be viewed as suggesting that more than
7 relatively small amounts of water can be extracted from this well under dry weather conditions without
8 substantially reducing the flow rates of individual springs in the area." FEIR Appendix A, Comment 07-
9- 35. Yet, that is exactly what the EIR does.

10 85. The University then mistakenly extrapolates its false interpretation of Mr. Aley's study
11 I(FEIR at 4-45; DEIR at 3.10-25) to assert that approximately 133,150 gallons per day -two thousand
12 times the rate of pumping Mr. Aley examined - can be sustainably extracted with "no discernible
13 downstream effects." DEIR at 3.17-30. Consequently, the University cannot credibly identify campus
14 groundwater as a potential source of water in the event the City of Santa Cruz has insufficient supply.
15 The EIR misleads the public because it fails to reveal that the study by Mr. Aley on which the EIR bases
16 its conclusions examined only a tiny percentage - 0.048 % - of the pumping rate required to support the
17 development proposed under the LRDP.

18 86. As Mr. Aley concludes, "[t]here is insufficient information available on the marble aquifer
19 to conclude that it is capable of providing a daily volume of 113,700 gallons of water to extraction wells
20 that would serve the University during dry periods without causing significant environmental problems.
21 Those environmental problems include cessation of flow from springs and an increased risk of land
22 subsidence or sinkhole collapse on University property." FEIR Appendix A at HAWC's March 8, 2021
23 IDEIR Comments (Comment Letter 07), Exhibit 1 (Comment 07-41). The University's claimed supply
24 rate from the aquifer of 133,150 gallons per day obviously cannot be true if a projected demand for an
25 even lower quantity - 113,700 gallons per day - cannot be pumped from the aquifer. Because the EIR
26 fails to provide the University, the City, the Santa Cruz County Local Agency Formation Commission

27 (**LAFCO") and the public with the information necessary to make an informed and thoughtful decision
28 regarding this Project's impacts on water quality and supplies, it violates CEQA. HAWC, 213

|VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT 26 -

- Cal.App.4th at 1297-1298, 1304-1305 (EIR must address informational needs of responsible agencies
2 such as LAFCO).

3 87. Furthermore, the EIR fails to address other obvious impacts on water resources. For
4 lexample, it overlooks the impacts on water resources from the Project's creation of large areas of
5 impervious surfaces. It admits that "[s]everal currently undeveloped areas along the upper/north campus
6 lare proposed for development under the 2021 LRDP," which will create new impervious surfaces. DEIR
7 at 3.10-33, 4-34. "Infiltration of rainfall is significant source of recharge of the shallow aquifer on the
8 north campus. Although this shallow groundwater is not extracted as a water source on the campus, it
9 supplies water to springs and seeps located throughout the north campus and in adjacent drainages."
10 DEIR at 3.10-33; see also DEIR 3.10-10, 3.10-25 to 3.10-26, 4-34 to 4-35; FEIR Appendix A at
11 HAWC's March 8, 2021 DEIR Comments (Comment Letter O7), Exhibit 1 (Comments 07-33, 07-34,
12 07-40). Therefore, any changes in impervious surfaces can have a significant effect on the shallow
13 aquifers of the area. Yet, while the EIR notes that these changes are likely, it entirely fails to address the
14 potential impacts on these vulnerable water resources from that reduced infiltration. DEIR at 3.10-33 to
15 3.10-34.

16 88. As with the upper/north campus, likewise throughout the campus, surface discharge from
17 shallow aquifers supplies headwater streams and saturates low areas and depressions. DEIR at 3.10-10,
18 3.10-25 to 3.10-26, 3.10-33; FEIR Appendix A at HAWC's March 8, 2021 DEIR Comments (Comment
19 Letter 07), Exbibit 1 (Comments 07-33 to 07-34). Although small in acreage, these streams provide
20 myriad habitats that support diverse plants and animals by providing shelter, food, spawning sites and
21 wildlife movement corridors. DEIR at 3.5-8. -10, 3.5-12.to 3.5-13, 3.5-16, 3.5-20, 3.5-26, 3.5-31, 3.5-
22 33. However, the Project's addition of impervious ground cover could result in reduced rainfall
23 infiltration, and adverse effects on headwater stream flow, seeps, saturated depressions, and springs, and
24 to the biota that rely on them. Because these shallow aquifers are often small, a single acre of added
a 25 impervious surface can have a significant impact. DEIR, Appendix G at Table G1-2. The smaller the
26 watershed, the greater the impact. But despite these facts, the EIR fails to address the reduction in
27 infiltration to these aquifers from the Project's construction of buildings, parking lots, roads and other
28 impervious surfaces that will appreciably reduce infiltration to the campus' small, scattered and shallow

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 27 -

karst aquifers. That omission deprives the public and the University of vital information required for
2 informed decisisonmaking, contrary to CEQA.

3 89. The EIR likewise fails to provide an adequate discussion of the Project's cumulative
4 impacts on hydrological resources. It claims that "on-site retention of stormwater" is required "to comply
5 with UC Santa Cruz Post- Construction Requirements," and "therefore, continued compliance prevents a
6 reduction in flow to springs and to recharge the karst aquifer." DEIR at 4-35. But that assessment is
7 incomplete. It implies - but does not explain if or how - runoff would be impounded close to the new,
8 added impervious surfaces, or address how the impoundments will be designed to readily infiltrate the
9 captured water in a fashion to mimic the natural process. Without this information, the cumulative
10 hydrological effects analysis is incomplete, and leaves the public in the dark about the Project's
11 hydrological impacts.

12 Geology and Soils

13 90. As discussed, the karst formation below the UCSC campus is fragile and presents-
14 numerous hazards that construction on the surface can exacerbate. "The portion of the main residential-
15 campus underlain by karst is pockmarked with dolines (or sinkhole)." DEIR at 3.7-12. In addition to the
16 hydrologic uncertainties posed by an underlying karst formation, the topography also creates geologic
17 risks. "Problems occur when the landscape is altered by urban development. Erosion is a common side
18 effect of construction, transporting soil to the lowest part of the sinkhole where it clogs the drain." it DEIR
19 Appendix B at HAWC's April 8, 2020 Scoping Comments, Exhibit 3, p. 28. Development also
20 "increases the risk of induced sinkhole collapse." Id. at p. 27. Yet the EIR all but dismisses this impact.
21 DEIR at 3.7-27 to 3.7-28. After admitting that "[c]onstruction in karst terrain.is potentially hazardous
22 because many karst features are not visible at the surface," and that "boring data from prior investigations
23 [shows] the surface of the marble bedrock is highly irregular, varying in elevation by more than 100 feet
24 lover a horizontal distance of 10 feet or less,' the EIR erroneously concludes that the Project's geologic
25 impacts will be less than significant. DEIR at 3.7-27. But the conclusion does not follow from the facts.
26 The irregularity of the karst formation makes any construction above the formation a potentially
27 significant source of hydrologic and geologic impacts, ranging from "induced sinkhole collapse" to
28 erosion that "clogs the drain" of groundwater through the karst formation, as noted. There are numerous

|VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT • 28 •

Jalternatives to massive expansion of on-campus development, including off-campus facilities and remote
2 learning options, that could lessen or avoid those impacts. The EIR's failure to adequately identify,
3 analyze and mitigate these impacts violates CEQA.

4 Land Use and Planning

5 91. CEQA requires examination of a project's potential inconsistencies with applicable land
6 luse plans. Guidelines § 15125(d). The EIR declares that the 2021 LRDP would not conflict with existing
7  land use plans on the grounds "UC Santa Cruz is not subject to municipal regulations of surrounding
8 local governments, such as the-City and County of Santa Cruz general plans or land use designations, for
Q Iluses on property owned or controlled by UC Santa Cruz." DEIR at 3.11-11. But as discussed below,
10 development proposed in the 2021 LRDP includes area outside the City's approved water service area,
11 and the City's General Plan requires that any extension of a water service area must be approved by
12 LAFCO. DEIR at 3.17-11, citing City of Santa Cruz General Plan, Policy CC3.7. Accordingly, the EIR's
13 failure to identify the requirements of the City General Plan together with LAFCO's overarching concerns
14 as a responsible agency charged with reconciling potentially conflicting land use interests and regulatory
15 requirements violates CEQA. Guidelines § 15125(d); HAWC, 213 Cal.App.4th at 1297-1298, 1304-
16 1305.

17 Population and Housing

18 92. The EIR fails to provide an adequate examination of the Project's impacts on housing.
19 The area around UCSC has traditionally been a "very tight housing market, especially as it relates to
20 rental housing." DEIR at 3.13-5. According to the 2005 LRDP, housing is a "key issue[] essential to the
21 planning processes of UCSC." 2005 LRDP, 23. The "housing market is influenced by several factors,
22 including proximity to major job centers, low for-sale inventory, and an "extremely tight" rental market."
23 DEIR at 3.13-5.

24 93. The Project would significantly exacerbate the current housing shortage by bringing
25 approximately 9,500 more students to the Santa Cruz campus. NOD at 1. Furthermore, although it
26 Iwould also add 2,200 more FTE faculty and staff members, the Project will only house 25% of that
27 ladditional faculty and staff. Id. The 2021 LRDP will thus unleash an additional 1,650 faculty and staff
28 members to find housing in an already scarce and problematic market. Yet the EIR fails to adequately

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 29 -

discuss this impact and consider alternatives and mitigation measures to lessen it, including the use of
2 off-site alternatives such as satellite campuses and remote classrooms. As discussed, the EIR's
lassumption that on-campus student population growth is an inevitable force that must be accommodated
4 underlies the entire DEIR, and creates a false barrier to consideration of alternatives that would lessen
5 these significant impacts.

6 94. At petitioners' request, a nationally-recognized expert in evaluating the viability and
7 impacts of real estate development, Lewis ("Lew") Goodkin, evaluated the EIR's analysis of the Project's
8 impacts on housing for students and others. FEIR Appendix A at HAWC's.March 8, 2021 DEIR

9 |Comments (Comment Letter 07), Exhibit 2 (Comments 07-42 to 07-45). His expert-observations are
10 sobering, and demonstrate severe flaws in the EIR's review. Mr. Goodkin concluded that the EIR's claim
11 that the Project would have "less-than significant impact [on housing] overlooks two salient facts that are
12 never acknowledged, let alone analyzed." FEIR Appendix A at HAWC's March 8, 2021 DEIR
13 Comments (Comment Letter 07), Exhibit 2 (Comment 07-43). First, "The DEIR. fails to address the fact
14 that the price of [the Project's] student housing is so high relative to-the price of off-campus housing that
15 the occupancy of the new student housing units will fall far short of the DEIR projections, causing a large
16 /percentage of the new students to seek housing off-campus." Id. Mr. Goodkin then explains that "[t]he
17 new, unmet demand for off-campus housing will have several impacts that the DEIR fails to analyze,
18 such as the much greater traffic, and the related parking demands and associated air emissions from this
19 additional traffic, from new students who will commute to, rather than live on, campus." Id.
20 95. Second, Mr. Goodkin points out that "the DEIR fails to address the fact that as an
21 increasing number of new students are forced to find housing off campus because it is far less expensive,
22 the resulting and growing unmet demand for off-campus housing will displace existing renters from the
23 off-campus units that the new students will be able to occupy due to their greater purchasing power
24 compared to the average renter in Santa Cruz County. The DEIR never analyzes the resulting
25 environmental and socio-economic impacts on the surrounding community as existing renters of off-
26 |campus residential units are displaced to other areas farther from their existing plaees of employment, the
27 schools their children attend, and the other urban services such as stores they presently utilize." FEIR
28 Appendix A at HAWC's March 8, 2021 DEIR Comments (Comment Letter 07), Exhibit 2 (Comment

|VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 30 -

1 07-44).

2 96. For these compelling reasons, Mr. Goodkin concludes that "the DEIR is substantially
3 deficient." Id. Housing expert Goodkin's conclusions confirm that the EIR fails to analyze and disclose
4 the Project's impacts on housing in the surrounding communities and the resulting displacement of low
5 income families from existing rental units to outlying areas where the rents are less expensive, resulting
6 in increased traffic, air pollution and related impairment of quality of life. Id.

7 97: UCSC promotes on-campus housing as an affordable option, and premises its 2021 LRDP
8 land EIR on the assumption that students will fully utilize on-campus housing. But historical data shows
9 this assumption is incorrect. Typically, approximately 50 percent ef students reside on campus, and that
10 number will only get lower with the significantly increased costs of on-campus housing at UCSC. For
11 lexample, as Mr. Goodkin pointed out in his analysis of the SHW project re-approval, Chancellor Larive's
12 commitment to "30% below market [rate for SHW rent] is not supported by existing market data. Rather,
13 quite the opposite is true: proposed rents (as of 2018) for SHW are considerably above market by an
14 average of 100% or more." Expert housing analyst Goodkin therefore concludes that the SHW will not
15 draw a large percentage of students back to on-campus housing. The LRDP's assumptions that it will
16 house 100 percent of students and that housing costs will be below market rates are entirely unsupported
17 by the facts. The EIR violates CEQA because it fails to provide a reasoned and factually supported
18 analysis regarding the Project's impacts on housing.

19 98. In summary, the EIR ignores the severe adverse impacts on the environment due to the
20 Project's failure to provide affordable housing to its students and staff (or alternatively, to provide for off-
21 site learning alternatives), in violation of CEQA..

22 Public Safety

23 99. As the EIR admits, the Project will create significant fire risks including both ignition and
24 response risks during construction. DEIR at 3.18-13 to 3.18-16. But it is not simply construction that
25 would cause these impacts. Off-shore winds blowing from the north across the campus toward Monterey
26 Bay occur frequently, especially during the peak fire season in the fall. In the event of a major wildfire
27 propelled by off-shore winds blowing from the north, LRDP development in the North and West Campus
28 lareas will create and exacerbate immediate and extreme fire evacuation hazards. DEIR at 3.18-13.

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 31 -

1 100. Many of the nearly 11,000 proposed additional individuals, including students on the main
2 campus and faculty and staff in the proposed Coastal Zone housing, could only evacuate to escape a
3 wildfire via Empire Grade Road by exiting through the current West Campus entrance and the proposed
4 bridge over Cave Gulch to Empire Grade. In certain likely fire scenarios, the entire population of Bonny
5 Doon would likewise have only Empire Grade Road available as an evacuation route.

6 101. This outflux of people frantically evacuating to the south via Empire Grade Road would
7 create instant gridlock, backing up south-bound traffic on Empire Grade Road toward the north -- in the
8 direction of the on-coming fire. Adding thousands of evacuees from the LRDP's proposed new
9 development would create a death trap. Building up the North and West Campus areas would thus be a
10 blueprint for disaster similar to the traffic gridlock that trapped and killed residents of Paradise fleeing
11 from the Camp Fire in October 2018. It behooves the University to pay careful attention to this critical
12 public it safety issue, yet it only considered the potential wildfire impacts during construction.

13 102. In considering whether the growth prescribed under the LRDP is compatible with UCSC
14 lemergency evacuation plans, the EIR entirely ignores the ongoing impact of adding approximately 9,500
15 additional students. DEIR at 3.18-13. The EIR admits that there will be "short-term, temporary impacts*
16 on emergency vehicle access and evacuation because of roadway improvements and potential extension
17 of construction activities into the right-of-way," but that is only a small portion of the LRDP's impact.
18 DEIR at 3.18-13. The LRDP allows UCSC to increase its student size by more than half, and its current
19 faculty and staff to nearly double. That growth is enormous, and will undoubtedly substantially slow
20 Imovement on the evacuation routes. Because the EIR faits to analyze the impacts of the Project's
21 addition of more than 9,000 students and thousands more faculty and staff on the safety and efficacy of
22 the University's claimed evacuation strategies, it violates CEQA.

23 103. Likewise, the University's Mitigation Measure 3.9-4, calling for the preparation of Site-
24 Specific Construction Traffic Management Plans, fails to mitigate any impacts from the approximately
25 9,500 new FTE students that the 2021 LRDP allows. DEIR at 3.9-25 to 3.9-26, 3.18-14. Construction
26 Traffic Plans will not help the thousands of students who will utilize Empire Grade Road to try to
27 levacuate in an emergency.

1 A. The EIR Fails to Adequately Address the Project's Adverse Impacts on Water Supplies.

2 104. Most of the UCSC campus is within the City of Santa Cruz Water Department ("SCWD")
3 water service area. DEIR at 3.17-5. But "[t]he City of Santa Cruz is facing several obstacles in meeting
4 its present and future water supply needs." DEIR at 3.17-14. "While the City of Santa Cruz water supply
5 system is essentially the same as in 1960, the service population has increased 190 percent and is
6 lexpected to increase. In normal and wet years, the water supply system is capable of meeting the needs of
7 the current population, but even without population increases, the system is highly vulnerable to
8 shortages in drought years." 2005 LRDP at 25.

9 105. According to the City's Urban Water Management Plan (*UWMP"), "the City has had to
10 Ideclare a water shortage in five of the ... seven years" between 2009 and 2015. DEIR Appendix B at
11 HAWC's April 8, 2020 Scoping Comments, Exhibit 1, p. 8-1. And the UWMP predicts that the SCWD
12 will face shortfall by 2025. DEIR Appendix B at HAWC's April 8, 2020 Scoping Comments, Exhibit
13 1, pp. 4-6 (projected water use in 2025 is 3,225 mgy), 6-24 (projected water supply in 2025 is 3,164
14 mgy). Consequently, "[a]dequate water supply is a primary issue for UCSC and the City of Santa Cruz
15 given future anticipated shortfalls." 2005 LRDP at 23, 88 (quote). Increased development under the
16 LRDP would necessarily increase water demand, and as the EIR admits, "UC Santa Cruz's water demand
17 under the 2021 LRDP, would contribute to the need for the City to secure a new water supply source to
18 address the shortfall under multiple dry water year conditions." DEIR at 3.17-24.

19 106. The BIR does not address this significant water shortfall with accurate analysis. It claims
20 that "groundwater can be extracted from [a well within the karst aquifer] without substantially reducing
21 the flow rates of any individual spring in the area." DEIR at 3.10-25. But as shown above, that is simply
22 not true and any attempt to pump significant quantities of water from the fragile and easily overtapped
23 Jkarst aquifer could cause subsidence, sink hole collapse and other geologic hazards and adverse impacts
24 on the hydrological connections within the karst structures on campus. FEIR Appendix A at HAWC's
25 March 8, 2021 DEIR Comments (Comment Letter 07), Exhibit 1 (Comments 07-31 to 07-36, 07-40).

26 107. Moreover, this impact is not unavoidable, as the EIR asserts. DEIR at 3.10-25. The EIR
27 Ithrows up its hands, claiming that it "would be speculative to assume that implementation of additional
28 measures would reduce the campus's water demand sufficiently to avoid or substantially reduce the 2021

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 33 -

1 LRDP's significant impact on water supply." DEIR at 3.17-35. But that logic only holds true under the
2 erroneous premise that rapid and massive UCSC student population growth is inevitable. It is not, as
3 discussed. Consideration of an alternative that shifts campus growth to other off-site alternatives would
4 significantly minimize this impact in compliance with CEQA and the CSA.

5 B. The EIR Fails to Adequately Address the Project's Adverse Impacts to Special-Status Fish Species

6 108. The City's water sources support populations of Central California Coast ("CCC")
7 Distinct Population Segment steelhead (Oncorhynchus mykiss), a threatened species (62 Fed. Reg. 43937
8 (August 18, 1997)), and CCC Evolutionarily Significant Unit (ESU) coho salmon (Oncorhynchus
9 kisutch), an endangered species. 70 Fed.Reg. 37160 (June 28, 2005); 64 Fed.Reg. 24049 (May 5, 1999).
10 The endangered CCC coho relies on the San Lorenzo River watershed for recovery. 64 Fed.Reg. 24049.
11 The prospects for recovery of the CCC steelhead and coho are dependent on suitable habitat being
12 restored and maintained. Id. Certain minimum levels of flow and temperature are required in streams for
13 the proper development, growth and spawning of salmonids. Id.

14 109. "The City of Santa Cruz is facing several obstacles in meeting its present and future water
15 supply needs." DEIR at 3.17-14. Currently, in critically dry years, the City does not-have enough water
16 to meet the City's existing needs, including the instream needs for fish. 2005 LRDP at 88. And the City
17 projects a water supply shortfall by 2025. DEIR Appendix B at HAWC's April 8, 2020 Scoping
18 Comments, Exhibit 1, pp. 4-6, 6-24. During dry years maintenance of instream flow is critically
19 important for the survival of the salmonids, as rearing juveniles are typically unable to rear in small
20 tributaries and will need adequate water flow in the main stem of the San Lorenzo River. Id. As climate
21 change continues to alter ambient temperatures, the need for cool water flows will increase, requiring
22 corresponding reductions in water supplies for human uses, further limiting the City's ability to meet
23 water demands. Id.

24 110. Yet the EIR entirely fails to address the need to reduce water diversions in dry years to
25 prevent catastrophic impacts on imperiled salmonids in calculating the City's ability to meet water
26 demand in light of UCSC's proposed development of the Project. DEIR at 3.17-14. This omission
27 violates CEQA. Friends of the Eel River v. Sonoma County Water Agency (2003) 108 Cal.App.4th 859,
28 874-875 (EIR must address cumulative impacts of upstream and downstream diversions of water for

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 34 -

human uses on salmonid species in the iver); Vineyard, 40 Cal.4th at 448-449 (EIR must examine impact
2 of seasonal reductions in river flow on both salmonids and human water supply).

C. The EIR Fails to Provide Information Needed for LAFCO's Review of this Project.

111. The development proposed in the 2021 LRDP includes areas outside the City's approved
5 water service area. Providing water to such areas requires the approval of the Santa Cruz County
6 LAFCO, which is therefore a responsible agency for this Project under CEQA. DEIR at 3.17-11, citing
7 City of Santa Cruz General Plan, Policy CC3.7. Accordingly, the EIR must address impacts on water
supply in a manner that addresses the informational needs of LAFCO. HAWC, 213 Cal.App.4th at 1305.

9 112. But contrary to this CEQA duty, the EIR fails to address LAFCO's informational needs
10 adequately. It states that UCSC "does not believe that .. . approval by [LAFCO] is required for the
11 |campus to receive increased service for the development of those portions of the campus that lie in
12 |unincorporated Santa Cruz County." DEIR at 3.17-5. This is incorrect. It is the City, not the County,
13 that the University expects to remedy the Project's predicted water supply shortfalls. The City's
14 lextension of water service to the campus to supply the Project is plainly subject to LAFCO review, just as
15 it was in HAWC, 213 Cal:App.4th at 1297-1298, 1304-1305. Consequently here, as in the HAWC case,
16 the University must provide sufficient information about the Project's impacts on water supply to satisfy
17 the informational needs of LAFCO.

18 113. Rather than comply with this clear CEQA requirement, UCSC attempted to sidestep the
19 lissue by responding that it had "requested judicial intervention to seek clarity regarding the City's legal
20 lobligations,' in a lawsuit that is currently pending before the Superior Court. DEIR at 3.17-5. But the
21 University's obligation to meet its CEQA duties is. not dependent on whether the City has a legal
22 obligation to furnish water to the University. The University's CEQA obligations arise because it seeks
23 to build and operate a Project that will cause significant water supply impacts. Those obligations extend
24 to the entirety of the Project's impacts on water supply. As the CEQA Guidelines clarify, "'Project'
25 means the whole of an action . The term 'project' refers to the activity which is being approved and
26 which may be subject to several discretionary approvals by governmental agencies. The term 'project'
27 does not mean each separate governmental approval." Guidelines 15378(a), (c). Thus, the University's
28 obligation as a lead agency to address the "whole" of the Project and its impacts is not affected by the

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 35 -

1 possibility that the City might also bear some responsibility for providing water to the Project.

2 Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations

3 114. CEQA forbids approval of any project that will have significant environmental effects
4 unless and until the lead agency makes "written findings for each of those significant effects,
5 accompanied by a brief explanation of the rationale for cach finding." Guidelines §§ 15091(a), 15092(b).
6 The findings must "be supported by substantial evidence in the record." Guidelines § 15091(b).

7 115. An agency may not "approve or carry out a project" with unavoidable significant impacts,
8 |such as the University claims here, unless the agency has:

9 "(A) Eliminated or substantially lessened all significant effeets on the-environment where

10 feasible as shown in findings under [CEQA Guidelines] Section15091, and

11 (B) Determined that any remaining significant effects on the environment found to be

12 unavoidable under Section 15091 are acceptable due to overriding concerns as described

13 in Section 15093."

14 Guidelines § 15092(b)(2).

15 116. CEQA's requirement for a Statement of Overriding Considerations, pursuant to section
16 15093, demands that when approving "a project which will result in the occurrence of [unavoidable]
17 significant effects. .., the agency shall state in writing the specific reasons to support its action based on
18 the final EIR and/or other information in the record." Guidelines § 15093(b). Like the Findings, the
19 |Statement of Overriding Considerations must also be supported by substantial evidence in the record.
20 Guidelines § 15093(b).

21 117. The Findings adopted by the University to support its Approvals fail to acknowledge,
22 Imuch less rectify, the significant methodological, analytical and factual errors and omissions in the
23 University's environmental review. For example, the Findings rely on mitigation measures that will not
24 be effective to reduce the identified impacts to insignificance. The MMRP fails to remedy these
25 deficiencies.

26 118. Furthermore, the Findings fail to explain, based on substantial evidence in the record, why
27 campus growth to 28,000 FTE students is necessary. Findings at 75. As shown above, no such growth is
28 required and yet, the LRDP unnecessarily authorizes it. The Findings and Statement of Overriding

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 36 -

1 Considerations entirely fail to address this shortcoming.

2 119. Additionally, the Findings fail to explain, based on substantial evidence, why there are
3 feasible alternatives to on-campus growth that should have been considered, but were illogically ignored.
4 Findings at 79-87. As discussed above, the dismissal of feasible alternatives simply because they do not
5 provide on-campus education violates CEQA. There are many ways to integrate students into campus
6 life, even if they are not on-campus. The University's Findings and Statement of Overriding
7 Considerations again fail to address this shortcoming.

8 120. Furthermore, the Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations fail to address the
9 logical gap between the Project's adverse impact to the karst formation, and the LRDP's approval.
10 Findings at 23, 50-51. A mere reference back to the mitigation measure identified in the EIR does not
11 provide an adequate rationale for why the EIR erroneously concludes that the karst formation will remain
12 unscathed. This impact is significant and unmitigable, and must be identified as such and addressed in
13 the Statement of Overriding Considerations. The failure to adequately make Findings with regard to this
14 limpact violates-CEQA.

15 121. Because the Findings, Statement of Overriding Considerations and Mitigation Monitoring
16 and Reporting Program do not address these significant impacts, they are incomplete and fail to
17 adequately analyze the Project's impacts. Furthermore, the University's claimed "need" for the Project,
18 on which the Findings and Statement rely, is unsupported by the complete data and analysis that CEQA
19 requires, and based on an artificially limited range of alternatives. This subverts CEQA's purpose of
20 informed decisionmaking.

21 122. The Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations are thus not supported by
22 substantial evidence in the record, and fail to bridge the analytical gap between the Project's impacts and
23 the decision to proceed with the Project. Topanga Association for a Scenic Community v. County of Los
24 Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 515. Furthermore, both fail to consider and analyze alternatives and
25 mitigation measures that would substantially lessen the Project's impacts. Accordingly, they violate
26 CEQA. Guidelines §§ 15091(b), 15093(b).

27 123. Because the UCSC campus possesses extraordinary, yet vulnerable and irreplaceable,
28 environmental resources that the 2021 LRDP's proposed development threatens, those unique concerns

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 37 -

merit heightened analysis and creative solutions - including off-site alternatives such as remote learning
2 and satellite campuses - in the EIR. CEQA requires a thorough evaluation of the Project's potential
3 impacts and alternatives that informs the public and decision makers about how best to avoid and lessen
4 these potentially severe impacts. Yet the EIR fails in this informational goal. The EIR defines the
5 Project's objectives too narrowly, ignores feasible, plausible and less impactful alternatives, and fails to
6 consider and mitigate significant Project impacts. The EIR therefore violates CEQA and the Approvals
7 must be set aside.

8 124. Petitioners are entitled to declaratory relief under CCP section 1060 because an actual
9- controversy exists between petitioners and the University respecting the University's LRDP Approvals,
10 including its certification of the EIR, Findings, Statement of Overriding Considerations, Mitigation
11 Monitoring and Reporting Program, and NOD. Petitioners contend these Approvals violate CEQA, while
12 the University contends they comply with CEQA.

13 125. Petitioners are entitled under CCP section 526 to injunctive relief forbidding any
14 implementation of the LRDP and its Approvals unless and until the University has complied fully with
15 CEQA.

16 126. Petitioners are entitled to a writ of mandate setting aside the 2021 LRDP and its
17 Approvals, including the University's EIR Certification, Findings, Statement of Overriding
18 Considerations, Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program, and NOD.

19 127. Accordingly, this Court should issue a writ of mandate setting aside the Project Approvals
20 |until the University fully complies with CEQA, including preparation of adequate and factually supported
21 EIR. To assure the University's compliance with CEQA, this Court should issue an injunction forbidding
22 implementation and development under the 2021 LRDP unless and until the University fully complies
23 with these CEQA duties.

24 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

25 (Breach of Contract)

26 (Alleged by Petitioners Don Stevens, Russell B. Weisz, Hal Levin, Harry B. Huskey

27 and Peter L. Scott Against All Respondents)

28 128. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT 38

1 reference.

2 129. The CSA is a valid, existing and presently enforceable contract between petitioners and
3 the University. Petitioners are entitled to the University's performance of its obligations under this

4 |contract.

5 130. This Court has retained jurisdiction over interpretation and implementation of the CSA.

6 131. The CSA mandates that the University must complete a comprehensive analysis of
7 potentially feasible alternatives, including satellite campuses and remote classrooms, to accommodate
8 enrollment growth beyond what was analyzed in the 2005 LRDP before the University may approve any
9 Ilmajor amendment to the 2005 LRDP: CSA § 5.1.

10 132. By approving the 2021 LRDP before completing that required comprehensive analysis, the
11 University failed to comply with CSA section 5.1. Therefore, the University's approval of the 2021
12 LRDP violates the CSA and the University's contractual duties to petitioners.

13 133. Rather than considering alternatives to growth on the main campus such as satellite
14 campuses and remote learning, the Project and its EIR propose housing 100 percent of all new students
15 on the main campus. Such a commitment enables and financially compels the University to place its
16 thumb on the scales by jumping the gun and prematurely committing itself to approve unnecessary and
17 lunfettered growth. But the University's commitment to that growth and development without completing
18 the comprehensive analysis of potentially feasible alternative locations violates its contractual duty to
19 petitioners to first conduct the comprehensive analysis of alternatives required by section 5.1 of the CSA.

20 134. The University has not completed a comprehensive analysis of potentially feasible
21 alternative locations to accommodate UCSC enrollment growth, but yet it has adopted the 2021 LRDP.
22 The University has thereby violated its duty to petitioners under section 5.1 of the CASA to first identify
23 alternative, off-campus locations for growth and conduct a comprehensive analysis of their feasibility and
24 impacts.

25 135. Petitioners have performed all their obligations under the CSA.

26 136. Petitioners have no adequate remedy at law, as damages would not remedy the
27 University's breach of the CSA and the impacts of the University's expansion without compliance with

28 the CSA.

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 39 -

137. Petitioners are entitled to declaratory relief under CCP section 1060 because an actual
2 controversy exists between petitioners and the University respecting the requirements of the CSA and
3 how they apply to the LRDP.

4 138. Petitioners are entitled to specific performance of the University's contractual obligations
5 under the CSA pursuant to Civil Code sections 3367 and 3384, et seq.

6 139. Petitioners are entitled to an injunction forbidding the University from taking actions that
7  would cause a breach of its contractual obligations under the CSA pursuant to Civit Code sections 3368
8 and 3420, et seq., and CCP section 526.

9 140. Accordingly, this Court should order the University's specific performance of its duties
10 under the CSA, including completion of a comprehensive analysis of feasible alternative locations to
11 accommodate enrollment growth before approving any major amendment of the 2005 LRDP, including
12 the 2021 LRDP. To assure the University's compliance with the CSA, this Court should issue an
13 injunction overturning the University's approval of the 2021 LRDP and forbidding any development
14 under that Plan, unless and until the University fully complies with these CSA duties.

15 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1085 and 1094.5)

17 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)

18 141. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by

19 Ireference.

20 142. The University proceeded in excess of its jurisdiction and abused its discretion in
21 purporting to approve the 2021 LRDP and its EIR because such Approvals violate the University's duties
22 under CEQA and the CSA and this Court's Judgment approving the CSA in the following respects,

23 among others:

24 a. Such Approvals were not granted in accordance with the procedures required by

25 law;

26 b. Such Approvals were not based on the findings required by law; and

27 C. Such Approvals were not based on, or were contrary to, the evidence in the record

28 before the University.

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 40 -

143. The University failed to proceed in the manner required by law because it violated the
2 CSA and this Court's Judgment approving the CSA as alleged hereinabove.

3 144. The University also failed to proceed in the manner required by law because it violated
4 CEQA as alleged hereinabove.

145. The University's actions in approving the 2021 LRDP without complying with the
6 procedures required by CCP section 1085, et. seq., exceeded its jurisdiction and constitute a prejudicial
7  abuse of discretion, and therefore are invalid and must be set aside.

8 PRAYER

9 WHEREFORE, petitioners pray for the following relief:

10 1. For a writ of mandate ordering the University to set aside and vacate its approvals of the
11 2021 LRDP, including its EIR Certification, Findings, Statement of Overriding

12 Considerations, Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program, and NOD for failure to

13 comply with CEQA.

14 2. For declaratory relief declaring that the University's Approvals of the 2021 LRDP,

15 including its EIR Certification, Findings, Statement of Overriding Considerations,
16 Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program, and NOD are invalid under CEQA.

17 3. For an injunction restraining the University from taking any action to carry out any action

18 or development under the 2021 LRDP and its Approvals unless and until the University

19 has complied fully with CÉQA.
20 v For declaratory relief declaring:

21 a. The 2021 LRDP is a major a amendment of the 2005 LRDP and is thus subject to

22 the requirement for a comprehensive analysis of potentially feasible alternative

23 locations set forth in CSA section 5.1.

24 b. To date, the University has not prepared the comprehensive analysis of potentially

25 feasible alternative locations required by CSA section 5.1.

26 C. The University's approval of the 2021 LRDP was therefore contrary to and in

27 violation of the CSA.

28 5. For specific performance of the University's obligation under the CSA to complete a

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 41 -

-

2 comprehensive analysis of potentially feasible alternative locations to accommodate

3 proposed enrollment growth beyond that which was analyzed in the 2005 LRDP before the

4 6. University may approve any amendment to the 2005 LRDP, including the 2021 LRDP.

5 For an injunction setting aside the University's approval of the 2021 LRDP, and

6 forbidding the University from implementing the 2021 LRDP unless and until the
University has complied fully with the CSA.

7 7.

8 For a writ of mandate vacating the University's approval of the 2021 LRDP without
compliance with the CSA.

9 8. For attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

10 9. For costs incurred in this action.

11 10.

12 For such other equitable or legal relief as the Court may deem just and proper.
