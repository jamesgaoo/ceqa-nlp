VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- Petitioner Friends of Melrose Western (hereinafter "Petitioner") seeks a writ of a

2 mandate against Respondent City of Los Angeles (hereinafter "City" or "Respondent"),

3 and alleges as follows:

4 INTRODUCTION

5 1. This petition challenges the City's violations of the California

6 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code §S 21000, et seq., regarding the

7 City's failure to lawfully apply the requirements of CEQA and to conduct the

8 environmental review required by CEQA with regard to a project proposed by Real Party

9 in Interest, Maple Apartments Associates, L.P. ("RPI"), to construct a five-story residential
10 building at real property located at 525-543 N. Western Avenue, Los Angeles (the
bO9L-LOLL6 VO 'Buopesed Joold pg 'enuery 215 North Jarengo APC WHId MVI THE SILVERSTEIN 11 "Project").

12 2. This action challenges the legal validity of the City's Notice of Exemption

13 filed June 5. 2020 and its improper application of a CEQA statutory exemption to exempt

14 the Project from environmental review under CEQA.

15 PARTIES

16 3. Petitioner Friends of Melrose Western is a California non-profit

17 unincorporated association, Its members include residents and businesses concerned with
18 environmental and government accountability issues. Petitioner brings this action on its

19 own behalf and on behalf of all other City of Los Angeles and County of Los Angeles
20 citizens interested in the City's compliance with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, Los

21 Angeles Municipal Code ("LAMC"), and all other laws.

22 4. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that

23 Respondent City of Los Angeles is a municipal corporation organized and existing in the

24 County of Los Angeles. The City has principal responsibility for approving the Project,

25 and therefore is the lead agency within the meaning of Pub. Res. Code § 21067 and CEQA
26 Guidelines § 15367 for purposes of environmental review as challenged and alleged in this

27 petition.

28
- 2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

:

1 5. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that Real

2 Party in Interest, Maple Apartments Associates, L.P. a is a California Limited Partnership

3 with its principal place of business in Ladera Ranch, Orange County, California. RPI has

4 been identified by the City as the Project applicant.

5 6. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities, whether individual,
6 corporate, associate or otherwise, of Respondent Does 1 through 10, or of Real Parties in
7 Interest Roes 1-10, inclusive, and therefore sues said Respondents and Real Parties in
8 Interest under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this petition to show their true names

9 and capacities when and if the same have been ascertained.

10 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

11 wconE APC WäH M J00f BIS 'ONUSAY O6UeJE YUON SIZ 7. This Court has jurisdiction over the causes of action asserted in this petition
pursuant to California Constitution Article VI, Section 10, and Code of Civil Procedure §§
LVERSTEIN 8 13 410.10, 1060, 1085, 1094.5 and 1103.
'euepesed 14 8. Venue in this Court is proper because Respondents are public officers,

15 agencies or entities, and this Court sits in the county in which the cause arose. Code Civ.
16 Proc. § 393.

17 9. This Court has personal jurisdiction over RPI because RPI is the applicant

18 and/or owner of the Project, which is located within the City of Los Angeles, County of

19 Los Angeles, and because RPI has purposefully availed itself of California's benefits and
20 the controversy at issue arises out of its contacts with California.

21 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

22 10. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of

23 Paragraphs 1 through 9 inclusive, of this petition.

24 11. On or about March 4, 2020, the Director of Planning for the City of Los
25 Angeles - without any public hearing or public notice - issued a Director's Determination

26 concerning the Project. The Project, as described in the Director's Determination, is for
27 the demolition of existing commercial buildings and the construction of a five-story

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 residential building to contain 64 dwelling units at 525-543 N. Western Ave., of which 63

2 are restricted to lower income persons as determined by the Housing and Community

3 Investment Department of the City of Los Angeles and at least 50% of those units must be

4 occupied by individuals that qualify as the "Target Population" as defined in Los Angeles

5 Municipal Code § 14.00 A.13. Under § 14.00 A.13.(a)(2), the Target Population to

6 occupy these units must "Have one or more disabilities, including mental illness, HIV or

7 AIDS, substance abuse, or other chronic health condition" and qualify as homeless under

8 applicable regulations.
12. Pursuant to the Director's Determination, the foregoing housing
10 requirements for the Project must be set forth in a recorded covenant to be enforced by the 9

J00ld pc 'enuaay OdV WHW MVT NIELSHEATIS THE 11 City's Housing and Community Development Department.
bO9I-LOLL6 VO 'euepesed 12 13. The Director's Determination letter included only one paragraph on CEQA,

oBuBJeIN qON SIZ 13 as follows:

14 "Pursuant to AB 1197, a project that is consistent with the definition

15 of Supportive Housing under Section 50675.14 of the Health and

16 Safety Code, meets qualified permanent supportive housing set forth

17 in the Los Angeles Municipal Code Section 14.00 A.13 (Ordinance

18 Number 185, 492), and is funded, in part, by general bond

19 obligations issued pursuant to Proposition HHH approved by the

20 City of Los Angeles at the November 8, 2016, statewide general

21 election. [Sic.] Therefore, pursuant to AB 1197 and Public

22 Resources Code Section 21080.27(b)(1), the project is statutorily

23 exempt from CEQA as Supportive housing. See Justification for

24 Statutory Exemption Case No. ENV-2019-7015-SE in the case file

25 for the narrative demonstrating that the project meets the eligibility

26 requirements outlined in AB 1197."

27 14. The referenced "Justifications" were not attached or hyperlinked.

15. The Director's Determination did not reference or attach a Notice of

2 Exemption.

3 16. The referenced "case file" "Justifications" provided in one paragraph:

4 "The Department of City Planning determined that the proposed

5 project is exempt from CEQA pursuant to Assembly Bill 1197,

6 Public Resource Code, Section 21080.27(b )( ). There is

7 substantial evidence demonstrating that the project is consistent with

8 the definition of Supportive Housing under Section 50675.14 of the

9 Health and Safety Code, the project meets qualified permanent

10 supportive housing set forth in the Los Angeles Municipal Code

14 November 8, 2016, statewide general election. All actions to

15 approve the Project were taken in furtherance of providing vitally

16 needed Supportive Housing to house and serve the homeless in the

17 City of Los Angeles."

18 17. On or about June 5, 2020, the City caused to be filed a Notice of Exemption

19 ("NOE") from CEQA. The NOE claimed the Project was statutorily exempt from
20 application of CEQA under Public Resources Code §§ 21080.27(a)(3) and 21080.27(b)(1).
21 Unlike the Director's Determination, which identified the Project's address as "525-543 N.

22 Western Ave." and described the location as "three (3) contiguous lots," the filed NOE

23 identified a smaller project located at 537-541 N. Western Ave and left out one contiguous
24 lot (i.e., 1/3 of the Project).
25 18. Public Resources Code § 21080.27(b)(1) provides that CEQA "does not
26 apply to any activity approved by or carried out by the City of Los Angeles in furtherance
27 of providing emergency shelters or supportive housing in the City of Los Angeles."

VERIFIBD PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Section 21080.27(a)(3) defines the "supportive housing" that is subject to the CEQA
2 exemption and requires, among other things, that the housing project "meet the eligibility
3 requirements for qualified supportive housing set forth in Ordinance No. 185,489 or

4 185,492." The foregoing section of the Public Resources Code became effective on or

5 about September 26, 2019.

6 19. The NOE states that "the project meets qualified supportive permanent

7 housing set forth in Los Angeles Municipal Code $ 14.00 A.13 (Ordinance 185,492). . . ."

8 20. The NOE and its attached justification, without any additional evidence or

9 analysis, recite: "(1) There is substantial evidence demonstrating that the project is

13 21. LAMC § 14.00.A.13(h) defines the "purpose" of the permanent supportive
Pasadena, 1 14 housing ordinance as: "to facilitate the expedient production of Supportive Housing units

15 meeting the definitions and regulations established herein in order to provide high-quality,

16 well-serviced and affordable housing units which are responsive to the needs of the Target

17 Population."

18 22. Under LAMC § 14.00.A.13(a)(2), the "target population" of permanent

19 supportive housing ("PSH") development includes, among others, persons with substance
20 abuse issues.

21 23. Prior to the effective date of Public Resources Code § 21080.27, and prior to
22 filing of the NOE, there was and continues to be a duly licensed commercial cannabis

23 distributor with a storefront, onsite retail operation located at 654 N. Manhattan P1., Los

24 Angeles, California 90004. The retail store operates under the name "California Cannabis
25 Melrose Dispensary" ("California Cannabis"). Pursuant to information available from the

26 State of California at the website maintained by the Bureau of Cannabis Control, said

4 including the City of Los Angeles, may adopt and enforce local ordinances including but

5 not limited to zoning and land use and other requirements to regulate cannabis businesses

6 that are authorized and licensed by the State of California, such as California Cannabis.

7 25. Effective December 19, 2017, the City of Los Angeles adopted its Cannabis

8 Regulations, the purpose and intent of which were to, among other things, protect sensitive

9 persons from the potential negative impacts of the retail distribution and use of cannabis.
10 LAMC § 105.00 states the City's purpose and intent behind its Cannabis Regulations as

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 17

18 (Inapplicability of CEQA Exemption for the Project)

19 40. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of
20 Paragraphs 1 through 39, inclusive, of this petition.

21 41. Pursuant to Pub. Res. Code § 21065(a), a "project" is defined as an activity

22 authorized by a public agency that may cause either direct or reasonably foreseeable

23 indirect physical change in the environment.
24 42. Unless the project is exempt, CEQA Guidelines § 15063 requires that "the
25 lead agency shall conduct an initial study to determine if the project may have a significant

26 effect on the environment." CEQA requires the local agency to prepare and certify the

27 completion of an environmental impact report on any project it intends to carry out or
28
. 12 -
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

approve that may have a significant effect on the environment. Pub. Res. Code §§
2 21151(a), 21100(a).

3 43. The agency has the burden to establish with substantial evidence that the
exemption applies and to make the respective findings. California Farm Bureau Federation

5 v. California Wildlife Conservation Bd. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 185.

6 44. The Court does "not presume that the City's decision was based on the

7 required findings or that those findings are supported by substantial evidence. (Cit.

8 omit.)." Committee to Save the Hollywoodland Specific Plan v. City of Los Angeles

9 (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1182.

10 45. "A lead agency shall find that a project may have a significant effect on a the
OSL-LOLL6 1OOL/,E ShDSAN ua pEen SIZ euepesed OdV 'Wdld MV1 NIELSH3ATI THE 11 environment and thereby require an EIR to be prepared for the project where there is
12 substantial evidence, in light of the whole record, that . . . . (4) The environmental effects
13 of a project will cause substantial adverse effects on human beings, either directly or
14 indirectly." Guidelines 8 15065(a)(4). Regarding housing projects and statutory

15 exemptions, the Project's effects on the Project's future occupants, as well as its potential
16 to exacerbate existing environmental hazards, are considered an environmental impact

17 under CEQA. California Building Industry Assn. v. Bay Area Air Quality Management
18 Dist. (2015) 62 Cal.4th 369, 392-393.

19 46. CEQA statutory exemptions for housing projects provide an exception of
20 "unusual circumstances" to the exemption, where there is a reasonable possibility that the

21 Project will have significant effect on the environment, including on the Project's future
22 residents, due to unusual circumstances. Pub. Res. Code § 21159.24(b)(1) (infill
23 residential projects with at least 10% affordable units); § 21159.23(c) (100% affordable
24  projects).

POSL-L0LL6 50.
EEIOTMY venue, oBueJeIN YUoN Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the

THE SILVERSTE 8 12 CEQA exemption used by the City to approve the Project is inapplicable. RPI's five story,

asadena, 13 64-unit Supportive Housing development is a "project" under CEQA. Pub. Res. Code §
14 21065. The City failed to proceed in the manner required by law in that the City did not
15 prepare an Initial Study, did not prepare an EIR for the project, and did not assess feasible
16 alternatives or require mitigation measures as required under CEQA.
17 51.

18 Instead of applying CEQA, the City claimed - without substantial evidence
or explanation - that the Project qualifies as Supportive Housing exempt from CEQA
19 under new Pub. Res. Code § 21080.27. In furtherance of this claim, on June 5, 2020, the
20 City filed the aforementioned NOE.

21 52.

22 However, the Project does not qualify for an exemption under Pub. Res.

23 Code § 21080.27, inter alia, because it does not comply with the LAMC § 14.00.A.13(h)

24 purpose of providing housing "responsive to the needs of the Target Population" as defined

25 in City Ordinance No. 185, 492. Rather, the Project is detrimental to the needs of the

26 Target Population as it is proposed within a 700-foot-radius of commercial cannabis

27 activities, specifically of California Cannabis at 654 N. Manhattan P1., Los Angeles,

28 California 90004, for which a license has been issued by the State of California Bureau of

1 Cannabis, which commercial cannabis activities and location the City has previously

2 authorized and approved, but which would now conflict with the 700-foot-radius distance

3 requirements set forth in LAMC § 150.02(a)(2) by siting of the Project.

53. The license provided to California Cannabis operating within a 700-foot 4

5 radius of the Project is a fundamental vested right.
54. The Project separately and independently does not qualify for a CEQA
7 exemption because its 700-foot radius proximity to California Cannabis presents an 6

8 "unusual circumstance," and it is reasonably foreseeable that the permanent supportive

10 Population experiencing, among other things, substance abuse addiction will have a 9 housing Project - designed to provide housing responsive to the needs of the Target

13 55. The Cannabis Ordinance and its recognition of negative impacts of

14 Cannabis stores on permanent supportive housing constitutes substantial evidence that the

JHL 15 Project's siting within the 700-foot-radius of California Cannabis and its retail cannabis
16 sales operations may have significant impacts on the Target Population of the Project,

17 which therefore requires mandatory findings of significance (Guidelines § 15065(a)(4)),

18

56. Because the City's NOE conflicts with distance requirements established in and the preparation of an EIR.

20 LAMC § 150.02 for the protection of sensitive residents and surrounding communities, the 19

21 NOE is not supported by findings based on substantial evidence that the Project fully

22 complies with LAMC § 14.00.A.13(b) and its purpose to meet the needs of the sensitive
23 Target Population under LAMC § 14.00.A.13(h).

25 Project's impacts on the Target Population due to the Project's proximity to commercial 24 57. Because the City failed to make the required findings of significance of the

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 6

7 (Inapplicability of CEQA Exemption for the Project)

8 59. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations of

9 Paragraphs 1 through 58, inclusive, of this petition.

10 60. Pub. Res. Code § 21080.27(a)(3) defines a "Supportive housing" project
the eligibility 3001 € 'enuaxy oBUeJE) YMON SIZ 11 that potentially qualifies for a CEQA exemption as one "that meets .
SILVERSTEIN Wald MVI POSL-LOLL6 12 requirements for qualified supportive housing or qualified permanent supportive housing

8 13 set forth in Ordinance No. 185,489 or 185,492."
euepesed 14 61. The eligibility requirements set forth in Ordinance No. 185,489 include,
15 among other things, the requirement that the Project comply with LAMC § 14.00.A.13(b), §
16 including but not limited to the construction performance standards required by LAMC §
17 14.00.A.13(g)(13).

18 62. LAMC § 14.00.A.13(g)(13)(iv), in particular, requires Phase I and Phase II

19 environmental site assessments for a project that "involves soil disturbance on land
20 currently or historically zoned industrial or, previously used, in whole or in part, for a gas

21 station, gas or oil well or dry cleaning facility," which ESAs must be submitted to LADBS

22 and made "publicly available." This provision also requires the Project applicant to

23 undertake remedial actions recommended by Phase I and Phase II ESAs.

24 63. In the alternative, LAMC § 14.00.A.13(i) requires that the Project undergo

25 subsequent environmental process as an alternative compliance process, and provides that
26 the LAMC 14.00.A.13(g) construction performance standards are mitigation measures.

M 64. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the
2 proposed Project "involves soil disturbance on land currently or historically zoned

3 industrial or, previously used, in whole or in part, for a gas station, gas or oil well or dry

4 cleaning facility."

5 65. "CEQA prohibits piecemealing." California Clean Energy Committee v.

6 City of Woodland (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 173, 193-194. CEQA's prohibition against
7 piecemealing applies to CEQA exemptions, and the agency may not divide the project into

8 parts in order to qualify for an exemption. California Farm Bureau Federation v.
9 California Wildlife Conservation Bd. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 191.

10 66. For an exemption to potentially apply under CEQA and thereby dispense
North Marengo Avenue, 3" Floor D Y A  EAE A ION SH 11 with CEQA review, the entire Project must qualify for it, since CEQA defines the project +09L-LOLL6 12 as the "whole of an action" and requires CEQA review of the whole action. Guidelines §§

8 13 15378(a), 15062(a), 15003(h).
'euepesed 14 67. Guidelines § 15062(a)(2) requires the Notice of Exemption to include the
15 location of the Project by street address and cross street or by attaching a specific map.

16 68. CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines require a "good faith effort at full

17 disclosure." Guidelines § 151. "The lead agency shall not knowingly release a deficient

18 document hoping that public comments will correct defects in the document." Guidelines

19 § 15020.

21 inconsistently lists the Project address as 537-541 N. Western Ave. Petitioner is informed 20 69. The Project's NOE, which claims a CEQA exemption applies to the Project,

22 and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the address range provided in the NOE is

23 deficient as it apparently covers less than the whole of the Project site, as the whole of the

24 Project site is elsewhere listed by the City as 525-543 N. Western Ave. Petitioner is
25 informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the NOE's failure to include all of
26 the Project site violates CEQA's mandate to identify the accurate location of the Project.

T 70. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that the

2 City's omission in the NOE of a portion of the Project and Project site is not inadvertent,

3 and that the omitted area may not comply with LAMC § 14.00.A.13(g)(13) because of

4 historic industrial uses on or at the site and/or environmental clean-up issues there.

5 71. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that because

6 the City failed to include the entire Project site in its NOE, it also violated CEQA's
7| piecemealing prohibition.

8 72. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that on this

9 separate and independent ground, no CEQA exemption can apply to the Project due to the

10 fact that the Project may "involve[] soil disturbance on land currently or historically zoned
APC J00 - 11 industrial or, previously used, in whole or in part, for a gas station, gas or oil well or dry PO9I-LOLL6 VO 'euapesed - THE SILVERSTEIN LAN FIRIA 12 cleaning facility," which requires public disclosure and remedial actions under LAMC

OBueJEN YUON 13 §14.00.A.13(g)(13)(iv), or the alternative compliance review under LAMC §
14 14.00.A.13(i).

15 73. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that because

16 the City failed to enforce CEQA's procedural requirements to issue an accurate NOE, to

17 carry its burden to establish the applicability of the invoked statutory exemption, to make
18 findings of compliance with LAMC performance standards, and to support those findings
19 with substantial evidence, the City violated CEQA's informational and good faith

20 disclosure mandates and failed to proceed in the manner required by CEQA. Mandate

21 relief as prayed is therefore required.

22 74. Petitioner as well as other members of the public will suffer irreparable

23 harm if the relief requested herein is not granted and the Project commences without
24 compliance with all applicable provisions of CEQA, the LAMC, and other laws.
