11 III.

12 PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY
13 10. The Project site is located at 3255 and 3145 Stetson Avenue, at the southeast corner of
14 Sanderson and Stetson Avenues in the City of Hemet, California. The Project site currently consists of
15 a combination of vacant land and an existing industrial development.
16 11. Approximately 2 acres of the eastern portion of the Project site is currently undeveloped
17 vacant land.

18 12. The existing on-site industrial development, which is known as the McCrometer facility,
19 includes 5 warehouse-style buildings, temporary use areas, and parking lots.
20 13. The western portion of the site consists of unpaved area, which is currently used for
21 overflow parking and storage of cargo containers.
22 14. The Project proposes to subdivide parcels to allow for the construction and operation of a
23 12-bay gas station, a 4,088 square-foot convenience store (7-Eleven) and Type 20 ABC License for
24 the off-sale of beer and wine, a 2,660 square-foot drive-thru fast-food restaurant, a 3,590 square-foot
25 car wash with 20 vehicle stalls and 21 self-serve vacuum stations under a 3,096 square-foot canopy,
26 and relocation of the McCrometer Inc. parking lot.
27 15. On or about March 31, 2021, the City provided notice of a draft EIR regarding the
28 Project. Petitioner and other parties submitted comments regarding insufficiencies of the draft EIR.
2
Concerned Citizens of Hemet v. City of Hemet Writ Petition and Complaint

1 Among other things, commenters noted the draft EIR's discussion of Project impacts was deficient, including failures to adequately analyze land use, aesthetic, and community character impacts, traffic
3 impacts, impacts to biological resources, air quality, and noise impacts, in addition to greenhouse gas
4 emission impacts, and impacts to water and cultural resources. Moreover, Petitioners and other parties
5 discussed deficiencies in the draft EIR's discussion of mitigation and alternatives.
6 16. In June of 2021, the City issued a final EIR regarding the Project, which did not
7 substantively revise the analysis in the draft EIR and failed to adequately respond to comments
8 received by the City.

9 17. On July 20, 2021, the City's Planning Commission held a hearing regarding the Project
10 and EIR. Petitioner and other parties spoke in opposition to the Project and EIR, specifically
11 discussing the Project's various violations and inconsistencies with the General Plan and Municipal
12 Code including but not limited to various land use policies, public safety policies, and the Project's
13 failure to meet the required findings for the approval of a tentative map, conditional use permit, permit
14 for a gas station, and permit for the sale of alcohol. Petitioner also expressed the necessary proposed
15 findings were unsupported due to the inconsistencies and violations of the General Plan and Municipal
16 Code.

17 18. Despite Petitioner's concerns and concerns from many others, the Planning Commission
18 voted to recommend approval of the Project and EIR.
19 19. On August 2, 2021, Petitioner filed an appeal to the Planning Commission's approval of
20 the Project and EIR,

21 20. On September 14, 2021, City Council held a hearing to consider the Project and EIR.
22 Numerous comments were received, orally and in writing, in opposition to the Project and the EIR,
23 including rebuttals to responses to comments on the draft EIR. Petitioners stated the City's responses
24 lacked evidentiary support and mostly restated previously made inaccurate assertions. These
25 inadequate responses indicate the Project still violates various Municipal Codes and remains
26 inconsistent with the General Plan, and the associated EIR continues to be grossly inadequate.
27 21. After receiving testimony, and despite the numerous expressed concerns from Petitioner
28 and many others, the City Council voted to approve the Project and EIR.

3
Concerned Citizens of Hemet v. City of Hemet Writ Petition and Complaint

1 22. Approvals included: EIR (SCH No. 2020031032) with Mitigation Monitoring Program, a
2 Site Development Plan Review (SDR 19-010), a Conditional Use Permit (CUP 19-009), and a
3 Tentative Parcel Map (TPM 37779) (MAP 19-003).

4 23. On September 27, 2021, the City filed a Notice of Determination.
5 IV.

6 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW 7

8 24. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies, and objections to the
9 Project have been presented orally and in writing to the City, as required by Public Resources Code
10 Section 21177. These include, but are not limited to, letters and oral comments presented during public
11 hearings.

12 25. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5
13 by mailing a written notice of commencement of this action to the City. A true and correct copy of that
14 notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

15 26. Petitioner has advised the City that Petitioner has elected to prepare the record of 16 proceedings relevant to the approval of the Project, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section
17 21167.6. A true and correct copy of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.

18 27. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code Section 21167.7 by filing a copy of
19 the original petition with the California Attorney General. A true and correct copy of the notification is
20 attached hereto as Exhibit 3.

21 28. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law unless the Court grants the requested writ of
22 mandate requiring the City to set aside its approval of the Project and the EIR. In the absence of such
23 violation of State law, and Petitioner will suffer remedy, the City's approvals will remain in effect in

24 irreparable harm because of the significant adverse environmental impacts generated by the Project.
25 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

26 (FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH CEQA PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS)

27 29. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Petition as if
28 set forth herein fully.

4
Concerned Citizens of Hemet v. City of Hemet Writ Petition and Complaint

1 30. The final EIR fails to meet the requirements for an objective analysis of impacts.
2 31. Respondents failed to recirculate the EIR after substantial changes were made.
3 32. Respondents failed to revise the EIR or prepare supplemental analysis after substantial
4 changes were made to the Project.
33. Respondents failed to follow procedures mandated by CEQA, including but not limited
6 to failing to notify responsible agencies, failing to provide proper notice for public involvement,
7 failing to provide adequate information in the EIR and allow for adequate opportunity for public input,
8 and failing to provide adequate access to Project-related documents.
9 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
10 (FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY CONSIDER ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS

11 AS REQUIRED BY CEQA)

12 34. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Petition as if
13 set forth herein fully.

14 35. Respondent's approval of the final EIR constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion in
15 that the EIR is not in accord with CEQA, the CEQA guidelines, and case law, but rather is legally
16 inadequate and insufficient in numerous respects, including but not limited to, the following:
17 a. The EIR fails to adequately analyze land use, aesthetics, and community character
18 impacts, such as failure to adequately analyze impacts to several scenic vistas that will be
19 obstructed if the Project moves forward including views of the San Jacinto Mountains,
20 failure to reconcile inconsistencies regarding impacts associated with all grading included
21 in the Project, and failures to adequately analyze the adverse environmental impacts
22 attributable to the Project's conflicts with the City of Hemet's General Plan.
23 b. The EIR fails to adequately analyze traffic impacts, such as failing to acknowledge
24 and properly analyze the additional and new vehicle trips that will be generated by the
25 Project's retail and restaurant uses, and failures to provide substantial evidence in support
26 of the City's decision to allow an exemption for the intersection of Sanderson Avenue
27 and Stetson Avenue without providing necessary mitigation for these impacts.
28

5
Concerned Citizens of Hemet v. City of Hemet Writ Petition and Complaint

1 C. The EIR fails to adequately analyze impacts to biological resources, such as the
Project site 2 failure to determine the existence of nesting birds and burrowing owls at the
before the issuance of a grading permit and thus not adequately analyzing the direct
4 impacts construction of the Project will have on the nesting birds and burrowing owls.
5 d. The EIR fails to adequately analyze impacts to air quality, such as failing to analyze
6 the combined emissions of construction and operation of the Project, failing to address
7 the Project's contribution to an existing air quality violation for fine particulate matter
8 under both the State and Federal standards for coarse dust particles, making incorrect
9 conclusions regarding odors that will adversely affect a substantial number of residents
10 despite the recommendations in the California Air Resources Board Proposed Air Quality 11 and Land Use Handbook, and the failure to adequately evaluate air quality impacts and
12 address emissions and health risk impacts or mitigate them.
13 e, The EIR fails to adequately analyze noise impacts, such as the incorrect assumption 14 that a perceptible increase in roadway noise only requires an increase of 3 decibels
15 without reference to any authority or evidence.
16 f. The EIR fails to adequately analyze greenhouse gas emission impacts, such as the
17 failure to acknowledge any potential significant impacts associated with greenhouse gas
18 emissions by insufficiently relying solely on measures adopted by the State, inaccurate
19 conclusions the Project would not have a significant impact to greenhouse gases without
support of substantial evidence, and the failure to address whether and how the Project 20

21 complies with Executive Order B-30-15 which establishes new interim statewide
22 greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.
23 g. The EIR fails to adequately analyze impacts to water resources, such as
24 contradictions that overall recharge volumes of associated water wells would not change 88 or that the Project would not interfere with groundwater recharge or would not
substantially decrease groundwater supplies despite the fact the Project site will draw
27 from the same wells that source the water of the City of Hemet Water Department and
28 Lake Hemet Municipal Water District. Additionally, the Project will not encourage the
6 Concerned Citizens of Hemet v. City of Hemet Writ Petition and Complaint

1 efficient use of water resources and is therefore inconsistent with the City's General Plan,
2 and the EIR fails to determine the appropriate leak detection method the Project will
implement to avoid impacts to groundwater associated with the underground storage of
gasoline tanks.

5 h. The EIR fails to adequately analyze impacts to cultural resources, such as the failure
6 to determine the existence of previously undetected cultural resources until after the
7 issuance of a grading permit but before initiating ground disturbing activities.
8 i. The EIR's discussion of cumulative impacts is deficient, such as the cumulative
9 impacts to nesting birds and burrowing owls, and the misguided and improper reliance on
10 compliance with the City's regulations for scenic corridors, zoning codes, and General
11 Plan policies to conclude no impacts to scenic vistas would be cumulatively considerable.
12 j. The EIR's discussion of mitigation is insufficient, such as the failure to adequately
13 address adverse impacts to aesthetics, greenhouse gas emissions, hydrology and water
14 quality, and land use resulting in the failure to provide any measures to mitigate the
15 Project's significant impacts to these areas of concern.
16 k. The EIR's discussion of alternatives is insufficient, such as the rejection of the
17 Alternative Project Location simply due to the irrelevant fact the applicant does not
18 currently own other location in the City, by failing to analyze whether any alternative
19 design to the commercial uses on the western area of the Project site would be feasible
20 and reduce impacts, by proposing an alternative that is necessarily infeasible, by
21 proposing an alternative that actually increases the footprint of the Project from its
22 current proposed design with no evidence of how the alternative would decrease overall
23 vehicle trips to and from the Project site, and by proposing an alternative that would have
24 even higher impacts to biological resources and would not decrease any impacts to air
25 quality, cultural resources, geology and soils, and transportation.
26 36. The EIR is sufficiently lacking that the only way to fix these issues would have been to
27 revise the EIR and recirculate an adequate report.
28 37. Respondents failed to respond adequately to public comments.

1 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
2 (FAILURE TO ADOPT FEASIBLE MITIGATION MEASURES
AND ALTERNATIVES REQUIRED BY CEQA)

38. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Petition as if
5 set forth herein fully.

6 39. Respondents failed to consider and adopt feasible alternatives, including but not limited
7 to, alternatives requiring less impacts that meet some or all the Project objectives.
8 40. Respondents defined the Project and its objections too narrowly, resulting in a narrowing
9  of the consideration of alternatives.

10 41. Respondents failed to adopt the environmentally superior alternative.
11 42. Respondents failed to consider and adopt feasible mitigation measures, failed to mitigate
12 for each environmental effect, illegally deferred mitigation, and failed to provide for effective and
13 enforceable mitigation.

14 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (FAILURE TO ADOPT FINDINGS THAT ARE SUPPORTED BY
EVIDENCE IN THE RECORD) 16

17 43. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Petition as if
18 set forth herein fully.

19 44. Respondents failed to adopt findings that are supported by substantial evidence in the
20 record. Among other things, the findings assert that the Project's mitigation measures adequately
21 reduce impacts below a level of significance without adequate evidence in the record to support such
22 findings, and the findings assert that the Project will be consistent with General Plan, Municipal Code,
23 and other requirements where there is insufficient evidence to support such consistency findings.
24 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
25 (FAILURE TO ADOPT A STATEMENT OF OVERRIDING CONSIDEATIONS THAT IS SUPPORTED BY EVIDENCE IN THE RECORD) 26

27 45. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Petition as if
28 set forth herein fully.

47. Petitioner incorporates by reference each of the allegations set forth in this Petition as if
set forth herein fully.

7 48. with the City's General Plan, including: The Project violates and is inconsistent

8 1. Policy LU-3.3, including but not limited to, failing to provide transitional uses
9 between commercial uses and single family uses;
10 m. Policy LU-3.4, including but not limited to, failing to buffer different land uses
11 through buffers, setbacks, edge treatments, site design, landscaping and building scale
12 and orientation;

uses and adverse effects to 13 n. Policy LU-3.9, including but not limited to, incompatible
14 safety and residential character;
15 0. Policy LU-4.3, including but not limited to, failing to promote reuse and infill
16 development consistent with surrounding uses and the needs of the community;
17 p. Policy LU-4.7, including but not limited to, failing to maintain and enhance property
18 values;

19 q. Policy LU-6.3, including but not limited to, failing to provide high-quality goods
20 and services;
21 r. Policy LU-6.7, including but not limited to, failing to appropriately control the 88 location, concentration and number of alcohol sales and tobacco products to prevent
adverse impacts to residences, schools, and parks;
24 S. Policy PS-11.2, including but not limited to, failing to provide for siting and 25 building design to minimize noise;
26 t. Policy PS-11.4, including but not limited to, failing to protect noise-sensitive nearby
27 residential uses.

28 49. The Project violates and is inconsistent with the Municipal Code, including:

Concerned Citizens of Hemet v. City of Hemet Writ Petition and Complaint

1 u. Municipal Code Section 70-133, the Project does not meet
2 the approval of a tentative map, as the necessary findings for
it is inconsistent with the
suitable for the General Plan, the site is not

4 type of development proposed, and the Project is likely to cause public
health problems.

5 V.

6 Municipal Code Section 90-42.5, the Project fails to meet any of the necessary
findings for the approval of a conditional use permit, as it will be detrimental to the
7

8 public health, safety, and welfare, and will be materially injurious to properties and

9 improvements in the vicinity. It is also not consistent with General Plan elements, goals,

10 or policies. It is not an appropriate type or intensity of uses that will be compatible with

11 existing land uses and the character of established neighborhoods.
w. Municipal Code Section 90-90, the Project fails
12 to meet any of the necessary

13 findings for the approval of alcohol sales. The property line of the Project site is directly

14 adjacent to residential uses, and the proposed use will be detrimental to surrounding

15 properties and neighborhoods, including contributing to loitering, public drunkenness,
noise, crime, and defacement and

16 damage to structures. The use will also adversely
impact the suitability of adjacent commercial zoned properties.
17 X.

18 Municipal Code Section 90-897, the Project fails to meet any of the necessary

19 requirements for the approval of a gas station, as it will directly adjoin residential uses

20 where homes front on the street and substantial buffering and setbacks are not provided.

21 Effects of nuisance activity, light, glare, noise, and emissions will impact adjacent
residences. The gas

22 station will not be adequately integrated or otherwise compliant with
applicable design standards.
