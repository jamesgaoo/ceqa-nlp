members, the general public, and/or in the public interest against Respondents CITY OF WEST

2 COVINA, its CITY COUNCIL, and its PLANNING DIVISION (collectively, "City" or

3 "Respondents") and Real Parties in Interest GREENLAW PARTNERS, LLC and AG WEST

4 COVINA OWNERS, LLC (collectively "Developer" or "Real Parties") and hereby allege as

5 follows:

6 I. INTRODUCTION

7 1. By this Action, Petitioners challenge the City's authorization to repurpose an

8 existing 177,440 square foot industrial building into an Amazon last-mile delivery station to store

9 and distribute retail projects to customers (*Project" or "Amazon Delivery Station DAX9") on a

10 21.22-acre site located at 1211 East Badillo Street in West Covina, California ("Site").

11 2. In furtherance of the Project, Real Parties requested, and the City granted, various

12 land use approvals including General Plan Amendment No. 20-03 to Industrial, Zone Change No.

13 20-04 to Manufacturing (M-1), Precise Plan No. 20-48 for Project Site layout and architecture,

14 Tree Removal Permit No. 21-12 for significant trees on Site, Tentative Parcel Map No. 83444 to

15 combine two existing lots into one, Development Agreement No. 21-01 to vest the Project's

16 development rights (collectively "Entitlements"). So too, Real Parties requested, and the City

17 approved, the certification/adoption of the Project's environmental review under a Mitigated

18 Negative Declaration (i.e., State Clearinghouse No. 2021070230) ("MND").

19 3. Petitioners maintain that the City's granting of the Entitlements and MND and the

20 associated findings and other approvals in effectuation thereof (i.e., Resolution Nos. 2021-103

21 through 2021-106 and Ordinance Nos. 2489 and 2490) (collectively "Project Approvals")

22 violated the California Environmental Quality Act, Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq., ("CEQA")

23 and 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15000 et seq. ("CEQA Guidelines"), as well as applicable land use

24 plans and zoning provisions within the West Covina Municipal Code ("WCMC" or "Code").

25 4. As set forth in the First Cause of Action, Petitioners allege that the Project

26 Approvals violated CEQA because Respondent used a MND in lieu of a more comprehensive

27 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"), despite a fair argument that the MND was inadequate for

28 failing to adequately analyze and mitigate various Project impacts, including but not limited to

LAW OFFICE OF
JORDAN R. SISSON VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

impacts on traffic, noise, air quality, hazards, aesthetic/glare, land use consistency, and climate

2 change, cumulative impacts thereof, as well as other CEQA deficiencies. Additionally, as set

3 forth in the Second Cause of Action, Petitioners allege that the Project Approvals violated

4 applicable land use plans, such as the City's General Plan, and findings for the Project lacked

5 substantial evidence and were in violation of the City Code.

6 5. For these reasons, Petitioners seek, among other things, that this Court invalidates

7 the Project Approvals until the City satisfies all State and local zoning/CEQA requirements.

8 II. JURISDICTION

9 6. This Court has jurisdiction under Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168 or 21168.5 and Code

10 Civ. Proc §§ 1085 or 1094.5. The parties and the Project Site are located in Los Angeles County.

11 The within action has been timely brought within 90 days of the City's granting of the

12 Entitlements per Gov. Code § 65009, and timely brought within 30 days of Respondents' posting

13 of the Project's CEQA Notice of Determination pursuant to Pub. Res. Code § 21167. Petitioners

14 served a Notice of Intent to file this Action on the City by mail before filing this Action pursuant

15 to Pub. Res. Code § 21167.5. (See "Exhibit A" attached hereto.) Concurrent with the filing of this

16 Action, Petitioners will timely notify the Attorney General of the State of California of the filing

17 of this Action in accordance with Pub. Res. Code § 21167.7.

18 III. PARTIES

19 8. Petitioner PEOPLES COLLECTIVE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE

20 (*PCEJ"')' is a community-based organization established in 2020 by residents and workers

21 impacted by both air pollution and other environmental justice issues caused by the growing

22 logistics industry in Southern California, including but not limited to eastern Los Angeles and

23 San Bernardino counties. With headquarters in Grand Terrace, California, PCEJ services affected

24 residents and members concerned with the increasing health impacts of industrial pollution in

25 their communities, such as impacts from several pending expansion projects adjacent to homes,

26 schools, and parks. Petitioner's mission is to ensure environmentally sustainable development that

27

28 A fiscally-sponsored project of Social and Environmental Entrepreneurs (SEE), Inc.

LAW OFFICE OF
JORDAN R. SISSON VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

does not worsen existing air pollution concerns. PCEJ members include affected individuals and

2 taxpayers who have a beneficial interest in the matters set forth in this Petition. PCEJ has

3 associational standing because its members would individually have standing given they
4 reside/frequent near the Site and would be impacted by the Project; the interests protected by this

5 Petition directly relate to the organization's chief purposes; and the relief requested is broad-

6 based and not needing participation of individual members in this Action.2 Furthermore, PCEJ

7 has public interest standing given this Action involves the City's duty to enforce applicable

8 zoning/CEQA laws.3

9 9. Petitioner BRANDY DAVIS is an individual who lives across the street from the

10 Site. Petitioners SHAHRAZAD SHISHEGAR and ARMANDO SANTOS are individuals who

11 also live in the City of West Covina roughly one and three miles from the Project Site,

12 respectively. Petitioners ADRIAN GUERRERO and JESUS NERI are individuals who work in

13 and around the City of West Covina. Individual Petitioners visit the Project vicinity daily and/or

14 weekly and will be affected by the negative impacts of the Project due to the City's failure to

15 comply with zoning/CEQA requirements, including but not limited to impacts on air quality,

16 climate change, hazards, noise, land use consistency, and other CEQA deficiencies. Their

17 proximity and nexus to the Project Site alone is sufficient to establish a beneficial interest and

18 standing to bring this Action. (See e.g., Bozung V. LAFCO (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 272; Simons v.

19 City of Los Angeles (1979) 100 Cal.App.3d 496, 500, fn. 4; Citizens Ass'n for Sensible Dev. v.

20 County of Inyo (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 151, 158.) Furthermore, they have public interest standing

21 given the Project involves the City's duty to enforce applicable zoning/CEQA laws.4

22

24 See e.g., Bhd. of Teamsters & Auto Truck Drivers v. Unemployment Ins. Appeals Bd. (1987) 190

10. Petitioner WEST COVINA ALLIANCE FOR RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT

2 ("WCARD") is an unincorporated association operating under a designated name by which it is

3 known, whose members include individual Petitioners mentioned above who a have a beneficial

4 interest in the matters set forth in this Petition, including being affected by the Project's negative

5 impacts. WCARD's mission is to ensure responsible development in West Covina and informed

6 decision-making by public officials and state agencies concerning projects that may cause

7 significant impacts to the environment in the City. WCARD was formed after the granting of the

8 Project Approvals pursuant to Pub. Res. Code § 21167(c). Petitioners have both public interest

9 standing and associational standing to bring this Action.'

10 11. Petitioners TEAMSTERS LOCAL 396 and TEAMSTERS LOCAL 1196 are labor

11 unions representing, collectively, roughly 30,000 workers employed in package delivery,

12 logistics, sanitation, and various other transportation companies throughout Los Angeles,

13 Riverside, San Bernardino, and Orange counties. Collectively, Petitioners have more than 500

14 members who live in West Covina who join together to fight for improved living standards and

15 working conditions. Its members reside and work near the Site, and they will suffer from Project

16 impacts, particularly related to environmental impacts and working conditions, which are core

17 issues to the function of unions. Hence, Petitioners have both public interest standing and

18 associational standing to bring this Action." Furthermore, unions have standing to litigate land use

19 and environmental claims, particularly when they have long-standing involvement in said matters

20 (as is the case here).7

21 12. Respondent CITY OF WEST COVINA is a general law city organized and

22 existing under and by virtue of the laws of the State of California, located in the County of Los

23 Angeles. Through its subagents, including but not limited to its elected CITY COUNCIL OF

24

LAW OFFICE OF 5
JORDAN R. SISSON VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

WEST COVINA and CITY OF WEST COVINA PLANNING DIVISION, the City is responsible

2 for the Project's compliance with applicable State/local planning laws and serves as the lead

3 agency under CEQA.

4 13. Real Parties in Interest GREENLAW PARTNERS, LLC and AG WEST COVINA

5 OWNERS, LLC are believed to be California corporations domiciled and/or operating in Los

6 Angeles County and recipients of the Project Approvals, as identified in relevant Entitlement

7 materials, Project Approvals, and/or the Project's CEQA Notice of Determination.

8 14. The true names, capacities, corporate, associate, or otherwise of Respondents and

9 Real Parties named herein as DOES through 10, inclusive, are unknown to Petitioners who,

10 therefore, sue said Respondents and Real Parties by fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this

11 Action to show the true names and capacities when they have been ascertained.

12 IV. GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

13 15. THE SITE: For context, the 21.22-acre Site is situated north of Badillo Road and

14 south of San Bernardino Road and is currently designated under the City's General Plan for

15 Civic- Public Institution and zoned SP-11 allowing a Faith Community Church. For nearly thirty

16 years, the Site has been utilized as a community church and school facility. Residential uses

17 surround the Site, including multi-family residences to the north (e.g., Mountain View Venture

18 Apartments in the City of Covina) and east (e.g., Lark Ellen Village residential community) and

19 single-family homes to the south of the Site.

20 16. THE PROJECT: The Project entails repurposing an existing 177,240 square foot

21 building for use as a last-mile delivery station operated by Amazon Inc. Packages would be

22 transported to the delivery stations via trailer trucks (i.e., 18 wheelers) from larger Amazon

23 fulfillment centers and sorted, picked, and loaded into delivery vehicles. Project construction

24 would take place during a five-to-six-month timeframe and include interior improvements to the

25 existing structure to facilitate throughput of packages and the addition of eight loading docks.

26 Construction would also include exterior improvements around the Site, including but not limited

27 to: restriping the existing parking lot; providing 811 parking spaces; modifying various

28 driveways; and altering on- and off-site circulation patterns. The facility would operate 24 hours a

LAW OFFICE OF 6
JORDAN R. SISSON VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

day, seven days a week, and is estimated to generate 14 line-haul trucks per day (delivering

2 packages from a sorting facility about 20 miles from the Site) with 142 delivery vans entering and

3 leaving the Site (at a rate of 36 vans every 20 minutes), as well as other vehicles entering and

4 exiting the Site to facilitate package delivery.

5 17. PROJECT APPROVALS: The Project Approvals were approved by the City's

6 Planning Commission and City Council on or around October 4 and October 19, 2021,

7 respectively, and Respondents filed the Project's CEQA Notice of Determination with the Los

8 Angeles County Registrar-Recorder on or around October 25, 2021.

9 18. EXHAUSTION: Petitioners, individually and through its members, as well as other

10 commenting parties, including but not limited to nearby residents and adjacent City of Covina,

11 objected to the Project Approvals orally, in writing, and/or by filling speaker cards during the

12 public comment period before the close of the Project's public hearings. Objections included but

13 were not limited to impacts on traffic, noise, air quality, hazards, aesthetic/glare, land use

14 consistency, and climate change, cumulative impacts thereof, as well as other CEQA deficiencies.

15 Petitioners have exhausted all administrative remedies, the City's determinations are final, and no

16 further City administrative appeals are available under State or local law. All issues submitted for

17 judicial review in this Action were sufficiently raised and disputed with the City before the

18 Project Approvals were finally approved. The City was given notice and the opportunity to

19 comply with CEQA, the Code, and other applicable laws but failed to do so.

20 V. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (CEQA Violations; Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5)

22 19. Petitioners restate and reallege Paragraphs 1-18 as if fully set forth herein.

23 20. The foremost principle in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended the

24 act to be read to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment. (See Cmtys. for a Better

25 Env't v. Cal. Res. Agency (2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 98, 109.) A chief purpose of CEQA is to

26 inform decision makers and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a

27 project. (See e.g., CEQA Guidelines 15002(a)(1); Lincoln Place Tenants Ass'n. V. City of Los

28 Angeles (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 425, 443-44.) Another chief purpose is to avoid or reduce

LAW OFFICE OF 7
JORDAN R. SISSON VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

environmental damage by requiring the implementation of "environmentally superior"

2 alternatives and all feasible mitigation measures. (Id., subds. (a)(2) & (3); see also Citizens of

3 Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564-565.)

4 21. To these ends, CEQA has a strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of

5 an EIR, which is reflected in what is known as the "fair argument" standard, under which an

6 agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence in the record supports a fair argument

7 that a project may have a significant effect on the environment. (See e.g., Laurel Heights

8 Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1123; No Oil. Inc, V.

9 City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75.) A lead agency must prepare an EIR if a project may

10 cause significant effects on the environment, even if the project is beneficial. (See e.g., Pub. Res.

11 Code §§ 21100, 21151; CEQA Guidelines § 15063(b)(1).)

12 22. The fair argument test is a "low threshold" where a project "may" have a

13 significant effect on the environment if there is a "reasonable probability" that it will result in a

14 significant impact. (No Oil, Inc, 13 Cal.3d at 83-84 n. 16.) Substantial evidence is enough

15 relevant information and reasonable inference that a fair argument can be made to support a

16 conclusion, even though other conclusions could be made. (See CEQA Guidelines § 15384(a).)

17 Substantial evidence includes facts, reasonable assumptions predicated on facts, and expert

18 opinions supported by facts. (See e.g., Pub. Res. Code §§ 21080(e), 21082.2(c); CEQA

19 Guidelines §§ 15064(f)(5), 15384.)

20 23. An agency must prepare an EIR whenever it can be fairly argued by substantial

21 evidence that a project may have a significant environmental impact. If there is substantial

22 evidence both for and against preparing an EIR, then the agency must prepare the EIR. Here, as

23 fully outlined in the comments submitted by Petitioners and other commenting parties, substantial

24 evidence - including expert opinion - demonstrates that the Project's MND was flawed by failing

25 to adequately disclose, analyze, and mitigate various environmental impacts caused by the

26 Project, including but not limited to traffic, noise, air quality, hazards, aesthetic/glare, land use

27 consistency, climate change, cumulative impacts thereof, as well as other CEQA deficiencies.

28 Respondents failed to acknowledge a fair argument of potentially significant impacts despite

LAW OFFICE OF 8
JORDAN R. SISSON VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

being confronted with credible opinions on all of these issues. Respondents should have prepared

2 an EIR. Any one of these impacts would lead to the requirement that an EIR be prepared. The

3 Respondents' refusal to prepare an EIR was not based on substantial evidence and was a failure to

4 proceed according to the law. Accordingly, Respondents should have circulated an EIR for the

5 Project.

6 24. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law other than the relief

7 sought in this Action. If the City persists in its refusal to rescind the Project Approvals and allow

8 the development of the Project, Petitioners, its members, and the public will suffer irreparable

9 harm from which there is no adequate remedy at law, in that the Project would be built,

10 operations would commence, and significant adverse environmental impacts would ensue. So too,

11 all Petitioners have public interest standing to enforce the City's duty to follow the State's vital

12 environmental laws, which have routinely been recognized by the courts as important public

13 rights. (See e.g., San Bernardino Valley Audubon Soc'y v. County of San Bernardino (1984) 155

14 Cal.App.3d 738, 754 [… litigation brought to enforce the provisions of CEQA and compliance

15 with planning and zoning laws has been held to involve important rights affecting the public

16 interest ."].)

17 VI. SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Zoning Violations; Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1085, 1094.5)

19 25. Petitioners restate and reallege Paragraphs 1-24 as if fully set forth herein.

20 26. The California Supreme Court has described General Plans and zoning schemes in

21 many ways. (See e.g., DeVita v. County of Napa (1995) 9 Cal.4th 763, 773 [as a 'constitution,'

22 "for future development located at the top of 'the hierarchy of local government law regulating

23 land use]; Topanga Assn. for a Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506,

24 a 517-518 [as a 'contracts,' where "each party foregoes rights to use its land as it wishes in return

25 for the assurance that the use of neighboring property will be similarly restricted, the rationale

26 being that such mutual restriction can enhance total community welfare"]; Orange Citizens for

27 Parks & Recreation v. Superior Court (2016) 2 Cal.5th 141, 159 [as a 'yardstick,' where "one

28 should be able to 'take an individual parcel and check it against the plan and then know which

LAW OFFICE OF 9
JORDAN R. SISSON VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

uses would be permissible"])). While planning agencies enjoy some discretion interpreting their

2 zoning laws, "deference has limits," and courts are not bound by unreasonable interpretations

3 contrary to the plain language of regulations and statutes. (Id. at 146, 156-157 [rejecting attempts

4 to "downplay the facial inconsistency," Court held city abused its discretion finding residential

5 project consistent with general plan designation where "no reasonable person could conclude that

6 the Property could be developed without a general plan amendment"]); see also Stolman v. City of

7 Los Angeles (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th 916, 928-930 [vacating variance based on zoning

8 administrator's interpretation contradicted by the plain language of the municipal code].)

9 27. Here, Petitioners are informed and believe that granting the Project Approvals

10 constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion by Respondents failing to proceed in the manner

11 required by law and/or making the necessary land use findings supported by substantial evidence

12 as required under the City Code. Here, as outlined in the comments submitted by Petitioners

13 and other commenting parties, substantial evidence demonstrates that the Project is inconsistent

14 with applicable land use plans, zoning practices, and provisions under the Code, such as Code-

15 required findings related to land use consistency, public safety, and environmental findings. (See

16 e.g., WCMC §§ 20-55, 26-229.)

17 28. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law other than the relief

18 sought in this Action. If the City persists in its refusal to rescind the Project Approvals and allow

19 the development of the Project, Petitioners, its members, and the public will suffer irreparable

20 harm from which there is no adequate remedy at law, in that the Project would be built,

21 operations would commence, and significant adverse impacts on the City's zoning would ensue.

22 All Petitioners have public interest standing to enforce the City's public duty to follow its zoning

23 laws and preserve the integrity of the Code and applicable plans, which serve significant policy

24 benefits to all persons within the City. (See e.g., La Mirada Avenue Neighborhood Assn. of

25 Hollywood v. City of Los Angeles (2018) 22 Cal.App.5th 1149, 1158-1159 [Supreme Court has

26 consistently recognized the importance of preserving the integrity of a locality's governing

27 general plan for zoning, which vindicates "significant policy benefits" to persons living near the

28 project, persons living within the planning area, and "all residents of the City who benefit from

LAW OFFICE OF 10
JORDAN R. SISSON VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

the trial court's ruling that holds the City Council's zoning decisions to the letter and spirit of the

2 municipal code.".)

3 VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

4 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for the following relief:

5 1. That the Court enter a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the City, including all

6 agents thereof, to set aside and void the Project Approvals for the Amazon Delivery Station

7 DAX9 pending Respondents' full compliance with CEQA and other governing laws;

RE: AMAZON DELIVERY STATION AT 1211 BADILLO STREET:
NOTICE OF INTENT TO FILE CEQA PETITION; PRESERVATION OF RECORDS

Dear City Clerk and Mr. Duarte:

This office serves as counsel to Peoples Collective for Environmental Justice, Shahrzad Shishegar,
Brandy Davis, Adrian Guerrero, Jesus Neri, Armando Santos, unincorporated association West Covina
Alliance for Responsible Development, and Teamsters Local 1932 and 396 (collectively "Petitioners") in
the matter of the approval by the City of West Covina ("City") of the last-mile Amazon fulfillment center at the above-referenced address ("Project") proposed by Greenlaw Partners, LLC ("Applicant"). As discussed below, this letter serves to (I) inform you that Petitioners intend to file an action against the City under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") and (2) remind the City of its duty to preserve the administrative record involving the Project.
First, please take notice, under Pub. Res. Code $ 21167.5, Petitioners intend to file a Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition") in Los Angeles Superior Court against the City challenging its approval of the Project, including but not limited to its granting/certification/adoption of General Plan Amendment No. 20-03, Zone Change No. 20-04, Precise Plan No. 20-48, Tree Removal Permit No. 21- 12, Tentative Parcel Map No. 83444, Development Agreement No. 21-01, the Project's Mitigated Negative
Declaration (SCH No. 2021|070230), Resolution Nos. 2021-103 through 2021-106, and Ordinance Nos.
2489 and 2490 made on or around October 19, 2021 (collectively "Project Approvals").

The Petition will allege that the City's granting of the Project Approvals violates CEQA and other
applicable zoning/planning laws. Petitioner intends to pray for the following relief: (i) that the Court enter a peremptory writ of mandate ordering the City to set aside and void the Project Approvals pending the City's full compliance with CEQA and other governing laws; (ii) That the Court issue temporary stay, stay, temporary restraining order, and/or injunction ordering the City to refrain from allowing the Project to proceed and issuing further permits while the Petition is pending; (iii) That the Court issue a permanent injunction ordering the Project halted pending the City's full compliance with CEQA and other governing law; and (iv) for other and further relief as the court finds proper.
Second, Petitioners intend to prepare the administrative record of proceedings in this matter ("Administrative Record) pursuant to Pub. Res. Code 21167.6(b)(2) and, thus, remind the City of its duty to preserve all records concerning the Project's compliance with If CEQA. If litigated, the matter will likely be reviewed by way of administrative and/or ordinary mandamus, which is generally limited to the record of proceedings before the City. (See Civ. Code Proc. § 1094.5; Pub. Res. Code § 21168; Western States Petroleum Assn. V. Superior Court (1995) 9 Cal.4th 559, 565.) In addition to mandatory documents listed in Pub. Res. Code 21167.6(e), the Administrative Record should include "pretty much everything

that ever came near a proposed development or to the agency's compliance with CEQA in responding to that development." (Madera Oversight Coalition, Inc. v. County of Madera (201l) 199 Cal.App.4th 48, 64 [disapproved on other grounds in Neighbors for Smart Rail v. Expo. Metro Line Cons. Auth. (2013) 57 Cal.4th 439, 465-457].) This includes but is not limited to internal staff communications, emails, texts, and other
communications involving the Project-which extends to personal electronic devices to the extent used
in the conduct of City business. (See Pub. Res. Code § 21167.6(e)(10); City of San Jose V. Superior Court (2017) 2 Cal.5th 608, 625 [officials cannot evade public disclosure by conducting the public's business on personal devices]; Golden Door Properties, LLC v. Superior Court (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 733, 765 [lead agency may not prune the record by deleting unfavorable internal agency communications, staff notes, and memoranda related to the project].) Hence, the City should ensure that all documents are retained, including all relevant Project-related emails and other communications.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this matter.

Very truly yours,
