INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the failure of the City of Los Angeles. its Planning Commission, and its
City Council. (collectively. the City) to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act

4 (*CEQA") in approving the 42-Unit Small Lot project proposed at 2520 North Eastern Avenue (2532,
5 2608. 2668 North Eastern Avenue and 2647-2651 Lombardy Boulevard in the City of Los Angeles (the
6| Project). Petitioner challenges the decision made by the City Council of the City of Los Angeles to
7 approve the development of. and to certify a Mitigated Negative declaration (*MND") for, the Vesting
8 Tentative Tract No. 73531-SL Project. Petitioner challenges the Zone change from [Q] RI-1D and [Q]

9 RD6-1D to (TXQ) RD5-ID and other land-use entitlement associated with the project.
10 2. The Project, as proposed. is unsuitable for its site. which is home to over 300 trees. These
11 trees include groves of 111 protected Southern California Black Walnut (Juglans californica) trees
12 subject to the City's native protected tree ordinance that were identified in a 2018 Tree Preservation
13 Report prepared by the applicant's consultant. The Project site is also home to understory plants such as
14 the native California Buckwheat and the City's protected Toyon (Heteromeles arbutifolia). The Project
15 site is a hilltop in the El Sereno Neighborhood in the City of Los Angeles which sits across from the EI
16 Sereno Recreation Center and Farmdale Elementary School. El Sereno Middle School is located one
17 block North of the project. The mostly undeveloped lot is a beautiful hilltop that is home to a sensitive
18 natural community. The Project proposes to construct 42 Small Lot units on the site which will require a
19 huge amount of destructive grading. The Project would actually chop 30 feet, three stories, off of eastern
20 and southern portions of the standalone hilltop.
21 3. The Project allows construction of 42 three-to-four bedroom houses with two-car garages on
22 this approximately five-acre hillside and required driveway access. The City granted the applicant four
23 distinct discretionary approvals: a Vesting Zone Change and Vesting Tentative Tract Map (to subdivide
24 three lots into forty-two lots with an average size of 5.200 square feet each and build small lot houses on
25 a all of them). a Zoning Administrator's Determination (to build one hundred seventy-eight retaining walls
26 in lieu of the allowed two). and a Haul Route Approval (to remove 78,000 cubic yards of earth in lieu of
27 the allowed 3.000 cubic yards).
28 4. In violation of the California Environmental Quality Act (*CEQA"). the City approved the
29 Project based on am inadequate and incomplete mitigated negative declaration (*MND") instead of an
30 environmental impact report ("EIR"). even though a fair argument exists that the Project may have
31 significant adverse impacts without mitigation.
32 5. There will be cumulative impacts such as biological, traffic. air. land use. dust/debris, noise

23 STATEMENT OF FACTS

24 History of Project and Project Site.
25 29. The current Project is to construct a 42-unit Small Lot project on a mostly undeveloped
26 hilltop in El Sereno. There is a long history of opposition to the removal of one third of the top of the
27 hillside and removal of rare California Black Walnuts (Juglans Californica) and wildlife habitat on the
28 project site.
29 30. The Project site also provides habitat for the Hoary Bat. Both the California Black
30 Walnut and the Hoary Bat are sensitive species.
31 31. The residents of this mostly Latino working-class neighborhood have substantial roots in
32 the community. Many have spent their childhoods playing on the hillsides in El Sereno.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 5

the land use and zoning recommendations contained in the Northeast Los Angeles
2 Community Plan is to constrain future residential development to the densities
that have already occurred in the neighborhoods throughout Northeast Los
Angeles.
Eastern Avenue is dedicated. improved Secondary Highway with two lanes of
6 traffic in both northbound and southbound directions. There is a center lane along
7 the property frontage. however. without a signalized intersection at the property
8 access point. exiting from the property into the southbound traffic lanes could
create traffic hazards.

10
11 35. Many objections to the plan were lodged due to adverse impacts on the neighborhood and
12 biological resources.
13

14 The Current Project and Administrative Process.
15 36. Consideration of the current Project at this site was resurrected in 2015 when the current
16 developer proposed a similar project in that it removes the top one third of the hilltop. a large number
17 of California Black Walnuts. removes wildlife habitat and endangers the Hoary Bat population in this
18 location.

19 37. Additionally, the problematic exit onto Eastern Avenue that was specified in the previous
20 project remain.
21 38. The previous project had been rejected due to non-compliance with the Hillside Ordinance
22 and the Northeast Los Angeles Community Plan and a dangerous exit.
23 39. The current MND. according to the Letter of Determination dated January 14. 2021. was
24 recirculated on April 6. 2017.
25 40. Up until the pandemic. El Sereno residents had been very engaged with this Project
26 circulating petitions. writing letters and attending meetings.
27 41. In response to the original MND filed in 2015. the City's Community Forestry Advisory
28 Committee wrote a letter on July 7. 2016 stating that there would be significant impacts from this
29 Project and requesting a full Environmental Impact Report (EIR) under California Environmental
30 Quality Act. (CEQA) because there is a fair argument supported by substantial evidence that the Project
31 may have adverse environmental impacts.
32 42. AB 52 requires lead agencies to notify and consult with Native American tribes regarding

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 7

overlooking and affecting their backyard uses forever."

2 46. Dr. Williams described in great detail the inadequacy of the mitigation measures
3 contained in the MND. He pointed out that in the Air Quality section that much of the language is not

4 enforceable as it states "Encourage" and "soon" in its measures. He points out how the MND

5 "Construction Staging and Parking Plan". will be provided "Prior to the issuance of...permit" and that is

6 inadequate for proper review and mitigation measures.
47. Melissa Kellogg submitted a letter dated July 14. 2016 outlining objections to and

8 concerns with the Project and the deficiencies of the MND. In her letter she also noted that the City

9 confirmed that 13 California Black Walnuts were removed from the Project site illegally.
10 48. Jamie Hall. attorney for El Sereno residents Melissa Kellogg and Demetria Contreras
11 submitted a letter dated May 24. 2017 explaining that under CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, if a
12 project is not exempt and may cause a significant effect on the environment, the agency must prepare
13 an EIR. (Pub. Resources Code $§ 21100. 21151: 14 Cal. Code Regs. $15064(a)(1). (f)(1).) He further
14 commented that the MND was deficient. His letter stated that the "destruction of an entire unspoiled

15 hilltop in the City of Los Angeles, increased traffic. increased greenhouse gas emissions. and other
16 potential growth related impacts constitute *substantial or potentially substantial adverse change[s] in
17 the environment[.]*** and thus an EIR was required. (Pub. Resources Code § 21068. 14 Cal Code Regs
18 15382.) His letter explained how the haul route estimations are obviously incorrect, identifying that
19 four trips per hour does not equate to 87 haul trips per day. Attorney Hall also asserted that it was
20 unclear how mitigation measures, including 16-3 Schools Affected by Haul Route can be successfully
21 accomplished given an average of 87 haul trips per day over a three-month grading period. His letter
22 also addressed the unsafe access points for this Project. aesthetics. geology. sensitive species. wildlife.
23 tree removal mitigation is inadequate and that feasible alternatives existed that would result in fewer
24 adverse environmental impacts. He also expressed concerns with noncompliance with the Northeast
25 Los Angeles Community Plan.
26 49. The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy (Conservancy) submitted three letters
27 opposing the Project. one dated June 27. 2016. a subsequent one regarding the updated MND dated
28 May 22. 2017 and a letter dated May 13.2020. The May 22. 2017. letter stated that the Conservancy
29 found that the MND "remained deficient in its analysis of visual. biological and land use impacts." The
30 letter called for the preparation of a focused EIR. The letter also stated that the Project was inconsistent
31 with the Northeast Los Angeles Community Plan Policy 4-1.1 which states. "Encourage the retention of
32 passive and visual open space which provides a balance to the urban development of the plan area.*

l and requiring social distancing. The Governor issued a stay-at-home order on March 19. 2020 that the

2 state shut down just a few days after the deadline. By April 17. 2020. the City of Los Angeles had
3 issued protocols for filing appeals online. Since this decision was issued March 3. 2020, residents did

4 not have the opportunity to use this procedure to file an appeal of the decision. Further, residents had
5 previously communicated with each other in person. There was no opportunity for residents in this

6 working-class community with a high number of Spanish speakers to organize to pool their resources to

7 hire an attorney. A comment was made regarding this by Clara Solis on June 8. 2021.
8 55. EI Sereno residents did not have representation on the Los Angeles City Council

9 (Council) effectively from November 7, 2018 when their Council Member Jose Huizar's office was
10 raided in an FBI probe for corruption until Council Member Kevin de Leon was appointed on October
13. 2020. On November 15. 2018. Counci President Herb Wesson (Wesson) removed Council
12 Member Huizar (Huizar) from his seats on Council Committees. On May 15. 2020. two days after the
13 hearing on this case before the East Los Angeles Area Planning Commission, Huizar announced that he
14 would limit his participation in City matters. This was prompted when the City moved to suspend
15 Huizar's role as a lawmaker. On June 23. 2020. Huizar was indicted in Federal Court on charges of

16 corruption alleging "pay to play" schemes involving land use cases - accepting bribes of 1.5 million
17 from developers. at which time he was suspended from acting as City lawmaker. Huizar for many
18 years chaired the City's Planning and Land Use Committee. Residents from the Council District 14
19 wrote to Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti in August 2020 requesting a moratorium on the approval of
20 all new projects in Council District 14 and requesting that each project be reviewed by an outside.
21 independent party or agency for all projects initiated during Council Member Huizar's tenure as well as
22 during the interim period and until the replacement Council Member is seated and established. A
23 comment was made about this by Clara Solis on June 8.2020.
24 56. On May 13. 2020. a hearing on this matter was held before the East Los Angeles
25 Planning Commission via Zoom. Hundreds of petitions and letters were submitted by concerned
26 residents expressing their opposition to the Project and their concerns about the Project's size. non-
27 compliance with the Northeast Los Angeles Community Plan, environmental impacts to trees and
28 wildlife. traffic. dangerous exits from the project. noise. light. pollution. construction impacts among
29 other issues. Some residents also attempted to comment at the hearing but were unable to do so due to
30 technical issues with the Zoom format of the hearing. Additionally. several individuals claiming to live
31 in El Sereno. whom no one recognized from Neighborhood Council meetings. spoke in favor of the
32 Project. Residents have complained that this is one problem with Zoom. Further. while each resident's

5 species and its habitat warrants far more substantial mitigation than a 4:1 replacement ratio in
6 unspecified locations and uncontrolled soil conditions. replacement ratio in unspecified locations and
7 uncontrolled soil conditions...**

8 61. Petitioners and other interested persons made oral and written comments on the Project
9 and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition.
10 62. On January 14. 2021, a letter of determination was issued by the East Los Angeles
11 Planning Commission finding pursuant to CEQA Guidelines 15074(b) that there is no substantial
12 evidence that the Project would have significant impact on the environment. allowing for the adoption
13 of an MND and the MMP. The Planning Commission approved a Zoning Administrator's Adjustment
14 and Zoning Administrator's Determination, and recommended the City Council approve the zone
15 change necessary to approve the Project. The decision also adopted modified conditions.
16 63. The notice of the letter of determination dated January 14. 2021 was only mailed to 8
17 people. Only one member of the El Sereno community. Melissa Kellogg. received notice of the
18 decision. She was represented by attorney Jamie Hall. Kellogg and settled her case with the applicant.
19 with terms of the agreement unknown to Petitioners. Three of the other notices were distributed to the
20 applicant and two representatives. one notice was sent to former Council Member Jose Huizar, and the
21 two remaining notices were sent to City Commission staff. Members of the community did not receive
22 this notice of the letter of determination despite having participated in the administrative process and
23 living in close proximity to the Project site. Moreover. many residents at the January 23. 2020 hearing
24 filled out cards asking for notice.
25 64. A draft notice of determination (NOD) was filed on February 4. 2021. This notice of
26 determination is the substantially the same (except for signatures and dates) as the notice of
27 determination filed June 18. 2021. The February 4. 2021 NOD left blank the date of project approval.
28 presumably because the Project was not approved prior to the approval of the necessary zone change.
29 Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines $15094. the "date of approval shall also be identified" in a notice of
30 determination. (Emphasis added.) Thus. the February 4. 2021 NOD was improperly filed prior to
31 Project approval. which did not occur until the City Council approved the zone change necessary for all
32 the Project, and was not in substantial compliance with the requirements of CEQA.

CEQA......when you take and destroy a rare plant species, a sensitive natural resource or a forest patch
2 you are just violating our environmental laws. you're destroying a natural resource that we need
especially during climate ...Item 7. This MND is an embarrassment. First it was not circulated to

4 CDFW for their input. Second. it makes the claim that there are no endangered or rare species. That's a
complete and utter lie. There are 111 mature California Walnut trees on this property. The Southern

6 California Black Walnut is a designated rare. vulnerable species in the state. has a restricted range with
7 relatively few populations with 21 to 80 occurrences.**
8 70. At the June 8. 2021 City Council meeting indicated above, Council Member Kevin de
9 Leon submitted a "technical amendment." This amendment was not made available to members of the
10 community. It is not present on the City's website. LA City Clerk Connect. The only access to the
language of this amendment at the time of the hearing was when the City Attorney read the amendment
12 into the record. It is now available only by listening to the council meeting via youtube. The
13 amendment as stated is: Modify recommendation 2 as follows, Icl improve Eastern A venue being
14 dedicated and adjoining the subdivision by the construction of a new concrete curb 2 foot wide concrete
15 gutter and full width concrete sidewalks with tree wells including any necessary removal and

29 71. The failure to provide the public with a written copy of this document prior to the
30 meeting or to allow residents to make public comments meant that the public was denied the
31 opportunity to participate. It resulted in the denial of the opportunity for Petitioners and other members
32 of the public to present any evidence on this matter. It was a denial of due process. Michael Hayden

(VIOLATION OF CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)
12

13 81. Petitioners incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.
14 82. CEQA prohibits a lead agency from approving a project that may have a significant
15 impact on the environment without first preparing. considering, and certifying an EIR. The City
16 violated CEQA by adopting an MND for the Project. despite substantial evidence supporting a fair
17 argument that the project may have a significant impact on the environment.
18 83. The purpose of the initial study is to provide the lead agency with adequate information
19 regarding a project to determine the appropriate environmental review document and "*documentation
20 of the factual basis for a the finding in a negative declaration that a project will not have a significant a
21 effect on the environment." (CIr. For Sierra Nevada Conservation v. County of El Dorado (2012) 202
22 Cal. App. 4th 1156. 1170. citations omitted.) There must be a basis within the record to support the
23 conclusions reached by the initial study. (Lighthouse Field Beach Rescue V. City of Santa Cruz (2005)
24 131 Cal.App.4th 1170. 1201.) -Where an agency.. . fails to gather information and undertake an
25 adequate environmental analysis in its initial study, a negative declaration is inappropriate." (EI Dorado

walnut tree grows at an annual rate of 24 inches per year. Therefore. it is likely that the MND
2 underestimates the number of trees on the Project site and also underestimates the number of trees that
3 qualify as significant and protected trees.
92. The MND fails to recognize a Sensitive Natural Community. The study and the Tree
5 Preservation Report provide information that shows that the Southern California Black Walnut is the

6 dominate species with a mixed understory that includes California natives (Toyon. Buckwheat). Any
7 mapping of this site following the CDFW's protocol document mentioned in Attorney Hall's comment.
8 titled "Protocols for Surveying and Evaluating Impacts to Special Status Native Plant Populations and
Sensitive Nature Communities, would conclude that a large portion of the site is dominated by
10 Southern California Black Walnut and consequently would be classified as walnut woodland or
portions of the site as walnut groves with a global conservation status rank of G3 (*Vulnerable-At
12 moderate risk of extinction due to a restricted range. relatively few populations [often 80 or fewer].
13 recent and widespread declines. or other factors). and is recognized as a Sensitive Natural Community
14 by CDFW. Whether or not the proposed building itself would impact walnut trees is irrelevant: the
15 Southern California Black Walnuts that would be impacted are part of the walnut woodland or groves.
16 93. Attorney Hall submitted comments that demonstrating that measures the MND adopted
17 (namely, replacement trees at a 4:1 ratio) are insufficient to mitigate the impacts to a rare Sensitive
18 Natural Community, because merely replacing individual tree specimens under the City's Protected
19 Tree Ordinance ignores CDFW's document titled -Protocols for Surveying and Evaluating Impacts 1o
20 Special Status Native Plant Populations and Sensitive Nature Communities." This CDFW document
21 addresses Sensitive Natural Communities in Environmental Review and recognizes Walnut Woodlands
22 or Groves such as located on the Project site as Sensitive Natural Communities that should be mitigated
23 at a ratio of no less than 5:1 (by area) for impacts to S-3 ranked communities. Moreover, the document
24 considers Walnut Woodlands distinct biological communities. consisting of trees. shrubs, vines. and
25 herbaceous understory vegetation. The MND only considers the value of the trees and fails to value of
26 these unique communities in a biological setting. Because the proposed Project would reduce the
27 habitat area on the site considerably (at least by 70%). it will have a resulting impact on the number of
28 wildlife species supported by the site.
29 94. The MND concludes that Project impacts to the Southern California Black Walnut
30 woodland or groves. a sensitive natural plant community, would be less than significant with
31 application of the City's Protected Tree Ordinance. Petitioners contend that requirement for
32 replacement trees under the City's protected tree ordinance does not qualify as a mitigation for special

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
19

Ordinance is insufficient: "The City's Native tree protection ordinance focuses on individual trees. but
2 misses recognition of the whole community of organisms that live within an area. in this instance

3 within the walnut woodland. Replacement of specimen trees on a site that has its habitat area

4 significantly reduced to accommodate structures does not offset the impacts to this recognized rare

5 Natural Community."
100. Attorney Hall proposed mitigation measures to reduce the adverse impacts but those
measures were not adopted.
101. The Community Forest Advisory Committee (CFAC). advisory committee comprising
representatives from each City Council office and approved by the Mayor with expertise in urban
10 forestry, proposed *Mitigation Banking" at an additional 2:1 by area for the loss of the walnut
woodland habitat but that mitigation proposal was ignored by the MND.
12 102. CFAC stated that the Project site is incorrectly described as urban infill because the
13 property is a rare five acres of contiguous woodland habitat that has been undeveloped for generations.
14 which does not fit the description of infill where the designation is assumed to be synonymous with
15 limited environmental impact.
16 103. CFAC stated that the property is a "critical and rare functioning ecosystem supporting
17 numerous species of mammals. birds. insects. plants and microbes" and determined that removing over

18 100 trees for the project and the over grading (85.000 cubic yards) for the Project will have a very
19 significant environmental impact.
20 104. The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy wrote a comment affirming its opposition to

21 the Project and finding that the proposed MND was deficient in its analysis of visual. biological. and
22 land use impacts.
23 105. The MND erroneously concludes that the Project will have no impact on forest land or
24 conversion of forest land to non-forest use. However. the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy

25 referred to the Project site as a one of a kind "large forested knoll" in its comment letter. A commenter
26 at the June 8 City Council hearing on the item. said the Project site has more in common with its larger
27 wild brethren than it does with a street tree or manicured park. a The USDA Forest Service refers to these
28 (the project site) natural wooded areas as "urban forest patches." "urban woodlands." or "forests in
29 cities"* and that they are referred to as Sensitive Natural Communities in the state.

31 b. Tribal Cultural Resource Impacts
32 106. CEQA requires careful consideration of a project's impacts on cultural resources. In this

trees for residents in the El Sereno neighborhood. These hills and trees are a valued public resource.

2 Instead with the lopping off of the hilltop. they will be left with a pyramid shaped monstrosity.
114. The LA-32 Neighborhood Council explained that the hillsides of El Sereno are a cultural a
4 treasure and scenic resource for the community. It states how the "*loss of this hillside will be
5 devastating to the community as it will degrade the visual character of this site and will degrade the

6 geographic identity of our community."
7

8

e. Land Use Impacts

10 115. CEQA requires an analysis of a project's inconsistencies with existing land use plans.
11 (CEQA Guidelines § 15063(d)(5).) If substantial evidence supports a fair argument that a proposed
12 project conflicts with the policies included in existing land use plans. "this constitutes grounds for
13 requiring an EIR. Whether a fair argument can be made on this point is legal question on which
14 [courts] do not defer to the City Council's determination." (Pocket Protectors V. City of Sacramento
15 (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 903. 930.)
16 116. As detailed by many in the community and in the 2013 decision by the City Planning
17 Commission the Project would conflict with the City's Northeast Los Angeles Community Plan.
18 117. The MND fails to disclose the Project's inconsistency with fundamental provisions of the

19 Northeast Los Angeles Community Plan.

20 118. The MND also fails to disclose the Project's inconsistency with the City of Los Angeles*
21 General Plan's policies and goals intended to protect residents, community character and cultural
22 resources.

23 119. An EIR is required to analyze all of these land use policy inconsistencies.
24

25 f. Air Quality and Greenhouse Gas Impacts
26 120. The MND's analysis of the Project's greenhouse-gas (GHG) impacts does not comport
27 with CEQA's requirements.
28 121. The MND failed to analyze the Project's localized construction and operational air
29 quality impacts.
30 122. The MND acknowledges that the Project would increase capacity. and thus increase
31 traffic volumes. The MND fails to adequately address the impacts associated with this increase in
32 vehicle miles traveled and the associated increases in air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. It

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 23

provide temporary-sound walls which reduce the sound by 10 dBA if they work. That is still above the
5 dBA considered a noise violation. (MND page IV 117.)
127. Noise impacts to Farmdale Elementary School would also be significantly adverse. There
would be a 6 dBA increase to 77.6 would exceed the 75 dBA noise limit established by the LAMC at
50 feet.

h. Traffic Impacts
128. The Project would increase traffic capacity and levels. The MND indicates increases in
Volume to Capacity. In some cases the increase pushes the intersection to the next worse grade.
10 129. Residents are local experts on existing conditions. In their letters they have expressed
11 concerns that during peak periods and during school pick up and drop off times traffic can back up on
12 Eastern and Lombardy.
13 130. In addition to significantly adverse increase in traffic levels, the Project would also result
14 in potentially significant traffic hazards. The 2013 determination letter by the City Planning

15 Commission identified traffic hazards associated with vehicles exiting from Eastern to go southbound.
16 which is a dangerous intersection and could result in an increase in traffic accidents. If accidents do
17 occur. how that will impact traffic on this arterial was not addressed in the MND.
18

19 i. Seismic Impacts
20 131. The MND fails to address the active Elysian Park Anticline as a seismic ground failure

21 concern for the development. even though the axis of the anticline lies just several hundred feet south
22 of the Project site. The active Elysian Park Anticline has been demonstrated to cause ground
23 deformation during past earthquakes. The MND should have, but did not. address the potential for
24 ground deformation (e.g.. tilting. folding) should a large magnitude earthquake occur on the Elysian
25 Park Blind Thrust.
