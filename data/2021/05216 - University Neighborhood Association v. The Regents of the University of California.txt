University Neighborhood Ass'n v. University of California, Riverside
Writ Petition and Complaint

INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges approvals by Respondents The Regents of the University of

3 California and University of California, Riverside (collectively "University," "UCR," or

4 "Respondent") of the University's 2021 Long Range Development Plan ("LRDP") ("Project"), and

5 associated Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"), Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program,
6 CEQA Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations, and the related failures to comply with
7 the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code § 21000, et seq.

g 2. Among other things, Respondent failed to consider the environmental impacts associated

9 with the Project, failed to prepare and circulate required environmental analysis, and failed to consider
10 and adopt feasible alternatives and mitigation.

11 3. Petitioner seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate declaring the University's
12 approvals invalid, and enjoining the University from taking steps to implement the approvals.

13 PARTIES

University Neighborhood Ass'n. v. University of California, Riverside Page
Writ Petition and Complaint

7: Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities of the persons or entities sued herein as
2 Does 1 through 10, and therefore sues these respondents by such fictitious names. Petitioner will amend

3 the Petition to set forth the names and capacities of said respondents along with appropriate charging

4 allegations when the same have been ascertained.

5 PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY

6 8. The Project site is at the University of California, Riverside, at 900 University Avenue,
which is generally bounded on East Campus by the I-215/SR-60 on W. Blane Street and Watkins Drive,

8 and on the West Campus by the I-215/SR-60 on University Avenue, Chicago Avenue, Le Conte Drive,

9 and Canyon Crest Drive.

10 9. The 2021 LRDP for the University of California, Riverside is the guiding land use plan for
11 the physical development of the UCR campus. The 2021 LRDP designates general types of development
12 and land uses to facilitate new program initiatives and contains associated goals, objectives, and policies
13 to guide future expansion of the UCR campus. The prior LRDP was approved in 2005.

14 10. The 2021 LRDP plans for an enrollment projection of 35,000 students through 2035 (an
15 approximately 11,078 increase in students above the baseline 2018/2019 academic year), a faculty/staff
16 population of 7,545 (an approximately 2,806 increase above the baseline 2018/2019 academic year), and
17 estimates that up to a total of approximately 12.7 million gross square feet of building space
18 (approximately 5.5 million net new gross square feet) is needed to support the projected growth.

19 11. On July 14, 2021, the University posted the 2021 LRDP and associated Draft EIR on their
20 Planning, Design, and Construction website. Various Project materials, including the Draft EIR, were
21 temporarily inaccessible on the University website for approximately two days. Accordingly, the
22 comment period was extended from August 30, 2021 to September 3, 2021.

23 12. On September 3, 2021, Petitioner submitted comments to the University in opposition to the
24 2021 LRDP and associated Draft EIR. Comments by Petitioner noted the Draft EIR's discussion of

25 associated impacts was inadequate, including but not limited to, impacts to aesthetics, air quality, energy,
26 greenhouse gas emissions, hazards and hazardous materials, hydrology and water quality, noise, and
27 traffic and transportation. Petitioners also asserted the Draft EIR failed to adequately consider cumulative
28 impacts, including but not limited to, impacts to population and housing and recreation. Additionally,

University Neighborhood Ass'n. v. University of California, Riverside Page
Writ Petition and Complaint

1 Petitioner discussed the Draft EIR's failure to adequately consider feasible mitigation measures relating to
2 aesthetics, agricultural lands, biological resources, public services, and traffic and transportation.

3 Petitioner also noted the Draft EIR failed to adequately consider feasible alternatives. Petitioner also

4 asserted the Draft EIR was inconsistent with various applicable policies, goals, and requirements,

5 including but not limited to, the 2016 Air Quality Management Plan adopted by the County of

6 Riverside, and the 2018 Annualized Regional Per Capita Energy Use Threshold adopted by the
7| University. Lastly, Petitioner noted the Draft EIR was inconsistent with numerous University policies,

8 goals, and requirements, including but not limited to, the UCR Physical Design Framework, the UCR
9 Energy Use Threshold, the UCR Greenhouse Gas Emissions Threshold, and the UCR Housing Policy.

10 13. In November 2021, the University posted the Final EIR on their Planning, Design, and
11 Construction website for review.

12 14. On November 12, 2021, Petitioner submitted comments to the University on the Final EIR
13 associated with the 2021 LRDP. Petitioner's comments noted the Final EIR contained very few changes
14 from the Draft EIR, despite the many detailed comments from Petitioner and many other community
15 members, including the City of Riverside, on the EIR's failure to provide adequate analysis of the 2021
16 LRDP's various significant impacts. Petitioner also noted the Final EIR failed to provide adequate
17 analysis of mitigation measures and alternatives to various significant impacts, including impacts to
18 aesthetics, agricultural resources, air quality, cultural resources, noise, and transportation. Petitioner also
19| noted the EIR acknowledged the Increased Student Housing Alternative was the environmentally superior
20 alternative, yet neither the EIR nor Staff Report recommended its adoption. Finally, Petitioner asserted
a 21 that as a result of these numerous failings, the proposed findings were inadequate and not supported by
22 evidence.

23 15. On November 17, 2021 the University held a public hearing to consider approvals of the
24 2021 LRDP and associated Final EIR. Despite numerous comments in opposition from Petitioner and
25 many other members of the community, including the City of Riverside, the University approved the
26 Project. Approvals included: 2021 Long Range Development Plan, certification of the associated Final
27 EIR, adoption of a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program, and adoption of CEQA Findings and a
28 Statement of Overriding Considerations.

University Neighborhood Ass'n. v. University of California, Riverside Page
Writ Petition and Complaint

16. On November 18, 2021, the University filed a Notice of Determination.

2 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

3 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

4 17. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies, and objections to the

5 Project have been presented orally and in writing to the University, as required by Public Resources
6 Code Section 21177. These include, but are not limited to, letters and oral comments presented during
7 public hearings.

8 18. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5

9 by mailing a written notice of commencement of this action to the University. A true and correct copy
10 of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

11 19. Petitioner has advised the University that Petitioner has elected to prepare the record of
12| proceedings relevant to the approval of the Project, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section
13 21167.6. A true and correct copy of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.

14 20. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code Section 21167.7 by filing a copy of
15 the original petition with the California Attorney General. A true and correct copy of the notification
16 is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.

17 21. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law unless the Court grants the requested writ of
18 mandate requiring the University to set aside its approval of the Project and the EIR. In the absence of
19 such remedy, the University's approvals will remain in effect in violation of State law, and Petitioner
20 will suffer irreparable harm because of the significant adverse environmental impacts generated by the

21 Project.

22 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
