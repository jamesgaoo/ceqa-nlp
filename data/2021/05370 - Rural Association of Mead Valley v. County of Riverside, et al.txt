1 Petitioner, RURAL ASSOCIATION OF MEAD VALLEY (*Petitioner"), alleges through
2 this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate (*Petition"), as follows:
3 INTRODUCTION

4 1. Petitioner challenges the adoption by Respondent County of Riverside ("Gity"
5 "County" or "Respondent") of a Mitigated Negative Declaration and related discretionary
6 approvals (together, the "Project Approvals") for the Dedeaux Harvill Truck Terminal Project
7 ("Project"). As noted below, the County failed to follow the required procedures required by the
8 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") when it adopted the Mitigated Negative
9 Declaration for the Project. The failure to follow these procedures was prejudicial in that it
10 precluded informed decision-making. Moreover, implementation of the Project will have
1
8 substantial adverse impacts on the environment. ME1 ¡euueuO 'dnojs d77 •L706 B  PIE TH S IO A S O8 SI!H ALeAEE 12 2. The Project concerns the conversion of approximately 11.5 acres of vacant land in
13 the rural community of Mead Valley to warehouse and truck terminal distribution uses. The
14 Project comprises one buildings totaling 53,275 square feet as well as related improvements and
15 infrastructure. The building is anticipated to operate as a warehouse logistics a and truck terminal
16 facility, meaning that trucks traveling from locations such as the Ports of Long Beach and Los
17 Angeles will bring cargo to the warehouse building for sorting and transport on other trucks to 18 destinations in and outside California. These operations may occur 24 hours per day, seven days
19 per week. The Project will generate approximately 1044 total daily vehicle trips per day
20 including 564 daily diesel truck trips. One residence is located within approximately 155 feet of
21 the Project site and truck activity, yet the adverse and significant impacts associated with the
22 Project have not been adequately evaluated and/or mitigated in violation of the California
23 Environmental Quality ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.). Several other
24| residences are located less than 1000 feet from the Project. Indeed, the County's decision to
25 approve the Project runs counter to the recommendation of the California Air Resources Board
26 ("CARB") that industrial uses like the Project should not be located within 1,000 feet of

1 residences and other sensitive receptors.

3. The County of Riverside's approval of the Project and Mitigated Negative
3 Declaration for the Project must be vacated because the MND fails to comply with CEQA in a 2

number of important ways, including that the County failed to adopt all feasible mitigation and
5 alternatives for significant impacts. The decision to approve the Project without imposing all
6 feasible mitigation and alternatives is contrary to CEQA's "substantive mandate" that the lead
agency shall not approve a project with significant impacts where feasible mitigation or
8 alternatives exist to reduce the impacts. Moreover, the Mitigated Negative Declaration is 7

9 deficient in numerous ways and fails to adequately address and mitigate the significant
10 environmental impacts of the Project. Specifically, the flawed air quality analysis found that no
1 mitigation was necessary. The emissions report is inaccurate. The NOx emissions are above the 8 d77 dnous ME7 jeuueyo •LZ06 12 SCAQMD significance threshold, therefore the Project requires an EIR.
13 4. During the administrative review process, numerous interested parties notified the 8 elns "pAja euIlySI!M £888 SI!H Beverly 14 County that there was need for further analysis and mitigation due to the Project's adverse
15 effects. In spite of these reasoned comments in the record, the County approved the Project and
16 MND.

17 5. Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the
18 Project Approvals considered by Respondent, including rescinding any authorizations to proceed
19 with construction. The Riverside County Board of Supervisors certified a Mitigated Negative
20 Declaration for the Project on June 8, 2021. The Riverside County Board of Supervisors also
approved a Plot Plan. Petitioner requests that the Court vacate the Project Approvals because
22 Respondent failed to comply with the provisions set forth under the California Environmental 21

23 Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA"), and therefore failed to
24 proceed in a manner required by law.
25 6. Petitioner seeks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under California Code of Civil
26 Procedure section 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate, rescind and set aside all Project

19 areas of Air Quality, Biological Resources, Cultural Resources, Geology/Soils, Greenhouse Gas
20 Emissions, Hydrology/Water Quality, Noise, Paleontological Resources, Transportation, Tribal
21 Resources, and Mandatory Findings of Significance. However, staff recommended that an MND
22 was appropriate concluding that the Project's impacts could be reduced to less than significant
23 with the incorporation of mitigation measures.
24 32. The Draft MND for the Project was purported to be circulated for public review

1 CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS 8 d11 'dnouo MeT jauueua •1Z06 'SIlH Áuesea 8883 Vilshire sicd Suze 12 39. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public
13 agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental
14 implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the
15 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
16 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires
17 governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects
18 of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
19| otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with
20 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
21 40. CEQA is California's broadest environmental law and helps to guide public
22 agencies such as the County during issuance of permits and approval of projects. Courts have
23 interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest protection of the environment within the reasonable scope
24 of the statutes. CEQA applies to all discretionary projects proposed to be conducted or approved
25 by a County, including private projects requiring discretionary government approval. See
26 California Public Resources Code, sections 21000 - 21178, and Title 14 Cal. Code Regs., section

1 753, and Chapter 3, sections 15000 15387.

2 41. CEQA requires lead agency to consult with "all responsible and trustee
3 agencies" prior "to determining whether a negative declaration or environmental impact report is
4 required for a project." Pub. Res.Code § 21080.3(a). The CEQA Guidelines require the lead
5 agency to "provide a notice of intent to adopt a negative declaration or mitigated negative

6 declaration to the public, responsible agencies, trustee agencies, and the county
7 clerk...sufficiently prior to adoption…to allow the pubic and agencies the review period
8  provided under Section 15105." They also require the lead agency to send a copy of the negative
declaration or mitigated negative declaration "to every responsible and trustee agency concerned
10 with the project and every other public agency with jurisdiction over resources affected by the
project." Id. § 15073(c). Additionally, CEQA requires submission of copies of a negative 8 d77 Group, MET |euueus •LZ06 A10  M PANS THL SURA SODE SI!!H AueAeS 12 declaration or Mitigated Negative Declaration to the State Clearinghouse, including in situations
13 where a State agency has jurisdiction with respect to the Project and where the Projects is of is
14 statewide, regional, or area wide significance. Pub. Code § 21082.1(c)(4). CEQA also requires
15 notice to and consultation with State agencies, including "transportation planning agencies" and
16 "public agencies which have transportation facilities within their jurisdictions which could be
17 affected by the project." Id. 8 20192.4(a). The County failed to comply with the requirements,
18 including failing to provide copies and consult with Caltrans, despite the fact that the Project
19 could impact nearby transportation facilities.
20 42. A strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an Environmental
21 Impact Report ("EIR") is built into CEQA which is reflected in what is known as the "fair
EIR whenever substantial evidence 22 argument" standard, under which an agency must prepare an
23 in the record supports a fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the
24| environment. V. No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75, 82; Friends of "B" St.

3 predicated upon fact, or expert opinion supported by fact." Pub.Res.Code §21080(1).
4 Additionally, substantial evidence "means enough relevant information and reasonable
5 inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion, even

6 though other conclusions might also be reached.." CEQA Guidelines §15384(a)(emphasis
7 added). If there is "substantial evidence that the project might have a [a significant impact of the
environment], but the agency failed to secure preparation of the required EIR, the agency's

13 declaration that it is the policy of this state to 'take all action necessary to protect, rehabilitate,

15 CEQA.' [Citations.] An EIR is an 'environmental "alarm bell" whose purpose it is to alert the

19 45. Under CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, if a project is not exempt and may cause
20 a significant effect on the environment, the agency must prepare an EIR. PRC § 21100, 21151;
21 14 Cal. Code Regs. §15064(a)(1), (f)(1). "Significant effect upon the environment" is defined as
22 "a substantial or potentially substantial adverse change in the environment." PRC §21068; 14 Cal
23 Code Regs §15382. A project "may" have a significant effect on the environment if there is a

7 51. The MND at page 36 states that the Project's Regional daily operational
8 emissions would not exceed any of the SCAQMD thresholds of significance. Further concluding
9 that the cumulative impacts from long-term operation of the Project would be less than
10 significant. That analysis in inaccurate and fails to protect sensitive receptors some of which are

8 seniors living approximately 155 feet from the southwest boundary. This flawed analysis impacts Channel Law Group, d11 • LZ06 auns "pAia eJJysIIm €8€8 12 all emission analysis throughout the MND including GHG and air quality.
13 52. Additionally, the MND's traffic study is artificially limited to evaluation of the 8
SI!H Aueseg 14 immediate Project area, where the Project may impact a greater geographical area. Specifically,
15 the MND inadequately considers northbound traffic trips to utilize Cajalco Road (a.k.a. Cajalco
16 Expressway) as an east/west route for Project trucks. Cajalco Road is located approximately one
17 quarter of a mile north of the Project site and is regularly a faster route to and from the Ports of
18 Long Beach, Los Angeles and regional transportation warehouses than northbound on I-215. The
19 County acknowledges that a Cajalco Road widening project is planned. As such, the MND
20 should have, but did not, evaluate a scenario where Project traffic will use this road.
21 53. Further, the flawed plot plan exacerbates the traffic impacts of the Project. The
22 design of driveways and traffic flow measures along Harvill Ave. to enter the facility are flawed
23 by not allowing more than two trucks to queue along Harvill Ave. Almost one truck per minute
24  would enter and/or exist the facility if one reasonably assumes that no more than 50 trucks per
25 hour would enter and/or exit the facility during peak time zones. The Project will therefore lead
26 to a large number of trucks and cars backed up onto Harvill Ave. There is no shoulder on Harvill

1 north of the railroad crossing just a few hundred feet from the north driveway. The Project will
2 cause vehicles to queue in the middle of Harvill - a major Highway with speed limits at 50
3 MPH. A Patterson Avenue driveway design would be more efficient by avoiding congested
4 Harvill Avenue. Patterson is a local road with very few vehicles. Other than one residence, all
5 traffic would be from the Project or adjacent warehouse to the south. However, the applicant

6 refused to design the Project to utilize Patterson.

7 54. The MND did not include any analysis or mention of the Toxic Tailings dust
8 located on the Project site. The construction of the California Aqueduct and Val Verde Tunnel
9 built in the 1930's created large tailings piles. One of these tailings piles is located adjacent to
10 the Project site. Years of discing the Project site for weed abatement has resulted in toxic
1
0SA tailings dust on the Project site. The toxic tailings in the soil contain arsenic, lead and other
SIl!H LA0 PANE HM MAS IDA COSO Auereg 12 harmful chemicals.
Channel Law Group, - IZ06 13 55. The Project has numerous natural resources affected by this Project that are of
14 regional concern. As an example is the 2.2 miles of watershed and a number of blue line streams
15 that flow directly onto the project site. The area is home to burrowing owls, numerous other
16 birds and animals.

17 56. The Project site a is adjacent to a Very High Fire Area and located in a Very High
18 Fire Area.

19 57. The Project also violates the General Plan and therefore has substantial
20 environmental impact on land use/planning, impact on land use. "The propriety of virtually any
21 local decision affecting land use and development depends up consistency with the applicable
22 general plan and its elements." Orange Citizens for Parks and Recreation v. Sup. Ct. (2016 2
23 Cal. 5th 141, 153 (citation omitted). If a Project "will frustrate the General Plan's goals and
24 policies it is inconsistent with the County's General Plan unless it also includes definite
25  affirmative commitments to mitigate the adverse effect or effects." Napa Citizens for Honest
26 Government v. Napa County Board of Supervisors (2001) 91 Cal.App. 4th 342, 379. "[G]eneral

consistencies with plan policies cannot overcome specific, mandatory and fundamental
2 inconsistences' with plan policies." Clover Valley Foundation v. City of Rocklin (2100) 197
3 Cal.App.4th 200, 239.

4 58. The Site's General Plan designation is Business Park. The staff report for the
5 March 8, 2021 hearing claimed: "The proposed warehouse/distribution truck terminal building is
6 allowed [in] the BP designation ...' Staff Report at 6 (emphasis added). However, the report
was incorrect and the Project is inconsistent with this designation. The General Plan explains:

8 "The Business Park land use designation allows for employee-intensive uses, including research
9 and development, technology centers corporate and support office uses, clean industry and
10 supporting retail uses." General Plan at LU-62. The Project does not fit this designation. The
1
® appropriate General Plan designation is Light Industrial, which allows, among other things, ME7 |ouueus 'dnoug d11 -LZ06 3A0  MPINLES MLH ASERA O8 SIl!H Áuerea 12 "service facilities, warehousing, distribution centers, and surrounding retail uses." General Plan
13 at LU-62 (emphases added). The current zoning for the Project is (M-SC) Manufacturing Service
14 Commercial. Additionally, the Project fails to "[c]ontrol heavy truck and vehicle access to
15 minimize the potential impacts to adjacent properties," as required by LU 30.2. Furthermore the
16 Project is not "in proximity to transportation facilities and utilities" as required by LU 30.4. The
17| land use designation in the General Plan is Business Park consisting of small business and

18 manufacturing land uses.

19 59. The MND does not adequately address noise impacts. The MND dismisses
20 substantial constriction noise impacts because they will only occur during certain hours, MND at
21 92. But noise thresholds for land use planning purposes do not necessarily determine significance
22 for CEQA analysis. Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay Comm. V. Board of Port Commissioners
23 (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1381. Additionally, the Project's noise mitigation is vague and
24 insufficient. See Citizens for Responsible and Open Government v. City of Grand Terrace (2008)
25 160 Cal.App.4th 1323, 1341 ("there is no evidence of any measure to be taken that would ensure
26 that the noise standards would be effectively monitored and vigorously enforced.")

1 60. The MND fails to consider the impacts associated with the many large trucks
2 projected to use the Project, including potential safely impacts. The MND also fails to consider
3 the significant impacts associated with construction traffic. MND at 106-109.

4 61. The MND does not adequately analyze potentially significant air quality impacts.
Among other things, if both construction and operation emission occur at the same time the

6 Project would exceed the significance thresholds for both VOC and NOx.

62. The MND average greenhouse emissions from construction an operations over the

8 life of the Project. MND 71. Such emissions should be calculated as they actually occur, not
averaged over a longer period of time. See Taxpayers for Accountable School Bond Spending v.
10 Sam Diego Unified School Dist.(2103) 215 Cal.App.4th 1013, 1049.
1 63. The MND failed to include the railroad crossing just north of the Project site. The 8 d77 dnois MET |ouueyo -LZ06 2A0  VPANE RH SIPA S SOS SIl!H Aueneg 12 railroad crossing is narrow as it crosses Harvill Ave. Trains use this railroad crossing to carry
13 very hazardous chlorine to the EMWD water treatment plant northwest of the Project.
14 64. MND fails to nention the AOC resin factory a half mile away from the Project on
15 Rider and Seaton at Rider and Seaton. AOC is designated as an "Air Major" Clean Air Act
16 Stationary Source of Major discharge of air pollution creating over 100 tons of air pollution per
17 year. Trucks from the Project will use Rider and Seaton to access Cajalco Road. The Project is in
18 a SCAQMD non-attainment area.

19 65. Hydrology and Water Quality have not been adequately addressed in the MND.
20 66. MND is flawed in the design of the Plot Plan and road improvements along
21 Harvill Ave. The facility driveways and road improvement create additional queueing time,
22 idling time, and wait time for trucks entering and exiting the facility.
23 67. Harvill is a major highway with vehicles at freeways speeds.
24 68. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion
25 by failing to comply with the procedures outlined in the CEQA Guidelines and failing to conduct
26 the required environmental review for the Project. Accordingly, Respondent's Mitigated
