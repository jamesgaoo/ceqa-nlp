VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Petitioner, CLEAN UP WARNER CENTER CONTAMINATION ("Petitioner"), alleges
2 through this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition"), as follows: 1

INTRODUCTION 3

Petitioner challenges the adoption by Respondent City of Los Angeles ("City" or
5 "Respondent") of a statutory exemption determination, and the related discretionary approvals 4 1.

6 (together, the "Project Approvals") for the proposed development located at 21507-21529 West
Vanowen Street, Canoga Park, CA (the "Project"). As noted below, the City failed to follow the
8 required procedures required by the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") when it 7

adopted a statutory exemption for the Project. The failure to follow these procedures was
10 prejudicial in that it precluded informed decision-making. Moreover, implementation of the
11 Project will have substantial adverse impacts on the environment. ® Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the -1Z06 12 2. 20S VPNLS d11 'dnoJ5 MET |euueyo Project Approvals considered by Respondent, including rescinding any authorizations to proceed
'SI!H AjeAEg 14 with demolition and construction, because the City failed to conduct the required environmental 13

BUJYSIM E8E8 15 review. The South Valley Area Planning Commission ("APC") for the City of Los Angeles
16 determined that the Project was eligible for a statutory exemption from CEQA on or about April
17 22, 2021. The APC also approved a Project Permit Compliance Review and Project Permit
18 Adjustment for the Project. Petitioner requests that the Court vacate the Project Approvals
19 because Respondent failed to comply with the provisions set forth under the California
20 Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA"), and

23 Procedure section 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate, rescind and set aside all Project 22 3. Petitioner seeks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under California Code of Civil 21 therefore failed to proceed in a manner required by law.

PARTIES

2 4. Petitioner Clean Up Warner Center Contamination is an unincorporated

3 association dedicated to the protection of both the residents and the environment that are subject
to the Warner Center 2035 Specific Plan. Petitioner and its respective members have a direct and
substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondent complies with laws relating to
environmental protection. Petitioner and its respective members are adversely affected by
Respondent's failure to comply with CEQA in approving the Project. Petitioner has standing to
assert the claims raised in this Petition because Petitioner and its members' aesthetic, public-
9 health, and environmental interests are directly and adversely affected by Respondent's approval
10 | of the Project.
11 5. Respondent, City of Los Angeles, is a charter city incorporated under the laws of ® d11 'dnoJs MET [auueuO •1Z06 430  VPANE IBH LASIRA COSO SIIIH ÁueAeS 12 the State of California. The City is the lead agency under the California Environmental Quality
13 Act ("CEQA").
14 6. Petitioner is informed and believes and based thereon alleges that Real Party in
15 Interest 21515 Vanowen Street Associates LLC has a direct interest in the development of the
16 Project. The City named the entity in the Notice of Exemption filed with the County Recorder.
17 7. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties sued herein
18 as DOES 1-25, inclusive, and therefore sues these Real Parties by such fictitious names.
19 Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of fictitiously named
20 Real Parties in Interest. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each
21 Respondent designated herein as a DOE has some responsibility for the events and happenings
22 alleged in this Petition.
23 8. Members of Petitioner and other interested persons made oral and written
24 comments on the Project, objected to the Project, and raised the legal deficiencies asserted in this
25 petition.

PROJECT 8

12. The Project is located at 21507 - 21529 West Vanowen Street in Canoga Park,
10 California. The Project is within the corporate boundaries of the City of Los Angeles ("City")
11
8 and is subject to the jurisdiction of the Warner Center 2035 Specific Plan. The City has described d11 'dnoJo MET |euueYO -LZ06 12 the Project as follows in various documents published by the Department of City Planning:
13 8
14 Demolition of one, two-story commercial office building totaling approximately 53,412 # square feet on a 44,014 square foot lot before dedications, and the construction of a new,
Auereg 15 eight-story, approximately 85 feet in height, 166,995 square-foot in area, single-phase, multi-family residential building. The project includes 193 dwelling units including 11 16 Work-Live units for a total of 161,549 square feet of Residential Floor Area. The project
17 also includes approximately 5,446 square feet of Work- Live units as Non-Residential Floor Area according to the Warner Center 2035 Specific Plan. The Project includes four
18 levels of parking, two of which are subterranean, 249 vehicle parking spaces, 12 short term bicycle parking spaces, and 121 long-term bicycle parking spaces. The Project also
19 includes approximately 6,732 square feet of Publicly Accessible Open Space (PAOS) and the removal and replacement of three Street Trees in the Public Right of Way. 20

21 13. The Project Site is located in the Canoga Park - Winnetka - Woodland Hills -
22 West Hills Community Plan, the Warner Center 2035 Specific Plan, and the Warner Center 2035
23 Plan Sign District. The property has a Regional Center Commercial General Plan Land Use
24 Designation and is zoned (WC) RIVER-SN-RIO. The adjacent properties to the north, east and
25 west share the same zoning of (WC) COMMERCE-SN, while the southern adjacent properties

26 across Vanowen Street are zoned (WC) UPTOWN-SN-RIO.

27 14. The subject property is currently improved with a two-story commercial office

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 building. Abutting and adjacent properties to the north are improved with two multifamily
2 residential developments and surface parking. Adjacent property to the west, across Remmet
3 Avenue, is developed with a two-story commercial office building. Adjacent property to the east,
4 across Alabama Avenue is improved with a six-story apartment complex consisting of 174

5 dwelling units. Finally, to the south across Vanowen Street, the adjacent property is vacant (the

6 former Aerojet Rocketdyne site). The property fronts Vanowen Street and the proposed
7 development is within the required setbacks for the property. The property has lot depth of 118
8 feet, and a variable width of approximately 280 feet to the south along Vanowen Street and
approximately 320 feet to the rear.

10 15. The applicant for the Project sought the following two entitlements:
11 0 A Project Permit Compliance Review for the demolition of one, two-story 8 d77 Group, MET |ouueuo -LZ06 12 commercial office building totaling approximately 53,412 square feet on a 44,014 SI!H 1 0 7 P ISE MNLNIMCOCO Beverly 13 square foot lot before dedications, and the construction of a new, eight-story,
14 approximately 85 feet in height, 166,995 square-foot in area, single-phase, multi-
15 family residence building. The project includes a maximum of 193 dwelling units,
16 including 11 Work-Live units for a total of 161,549 square feet of Residential
17 Floor Area.

18 A Project Permit Adjustment to permit a minimum 12 foot and six-inch floor-to-
19 floor height for the "Work" portion of the Work-Live units in an Active Street
20 Frontage identified area in lieu of the 15 fect otherwise required in Section
21 6.2.4.2.1(a) of the Warner Center 2035 Specific Plan.
22 PROJECT BACKGROUND, ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL

23 16. The application for the requested entitlements was filed on March 25, 2018 by
24 Real Party. The proposed Project is subject to Specific Plan Procedures per Los Angeles
25 Municipal Code (LAMC) Section 11.5.7 because it is located within the boundaries of the WC
26 2035 SP. On November 9, 2020, the Director of Planning issued a Director's Determination that
27

5 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

approved the Project subject to Conditions of Approval.

2 17. On November 24, 2020, an appeal was filed by Gina K. Thornburg, Executive
3 Director of Coalition for Valley Neighborhoods, within the required 15-day appeal period,
4 challenging the entire decision of the Director of Planning. Reasons for the appeal pertain to
potential contamination of the Subject Property, based on its proximity to the United

6 Technologies Corporation (UTC) Canoga site (the former Aerojet Rocketdyne site), which is a
7 known contaminated 47-acre site. The appeal also raised concern for the Project's lack of
8 affordable housing.
9 18. On April 22, 2021 the South Valley Area Planning Commission conducted a
on the appeal, determined that the Project was eligible for a 10 public hearing. The APC acted
11 statutory exemption from CEQA pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 65457and approved 8 d17 'dnoJ5 -LZ06 1 0 I 8 ce Áueseg 12 the two requested entitlements for the Project. A Letter of Determination was issued by the City
13 on May 25, 2021.
14 19. A Notice of Determination was filed with the County Recorder on June 3, 2021.
15 On or about June 9, 2021, an appeal of the CEQA determination was filed pursuant to Public
16 Resources Code Section 21151(c). This CEQA appeal remains pending.
17 CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

18 20. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public
19 agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental
20 implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the
21 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
22 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires
23 governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects
24 of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
25  otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with
26 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 21. CEQA is California's broadest environmental law and helps to guide public
2 agencies such as the City during issuance of permits and approval of projects. Courts have
3 interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest protection of the environment within the reasonable scope
4 of the statutes. CEQA applies to all discretionary projects proposed to be conducted or approved
5 by a City, including private projects requiring discretionary government approval. See California

6 Public Resources Code, sections 21000 - 21178, and Title 14 Cal. Code Regs., section 753, and
7 Chapter 3, sections 15000 - 15387.

8 22. A strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an Environmental
Impact Report ("EIR") is built into CEQA which is reflected in what is known as the "fair
10 argument" standard, under which an agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence
11 In the record supports a fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the ® d11 'dnoJ5 ME7 Channel -1706 2 08 VPNE THLSIAA SO CE SII!H AJEAES 12 environment. No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75, 82; Friends of "B" St.
13 City of Haywood (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988, 1002.
14 23. "The EIR is the primary means of achieving the Legislature's considered
15 declaration that it is the policy of this state to "take all action necessary to protect, rehabilitate,
16 and enhance the environmental quality of the state.' [Citation.] The EIR is therefore 'the heart of
17 CEQA.' [Citations.] An EIR is an 'environmental "alarm bell" whose purpose it is to alert the
18  public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached ecological
19 points of no return.™ Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. V. Regents of University of California
20 (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.
21 24. Under CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, if a project is not exempt and may cause
22 a significant effect on the environment, the agency must prepare an EIR. PRC §§ 21100, 21151;
23 14 Cal. Code Regs. §15064(a)(1), (f)(1). "Significant effect upon the environment" is defined as
24 "a substantial or potentially substantial adverse change in the environment." PRC (21068; 14 Cal
25 Code Regs §15382. A project "may" have a significant effect on the environment if there is a
26 "reasonable probability" that it will result in a significant impact. No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 6

(VIOLATION OF CEQA) 7

8 25. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
9 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein,
10 26. The Project does not qualify for a Statutory Exemption under CEQA because the
11
8 Project does not comply with the Warner Center 2035 Plan Final Environmental Impact Report; d11 'dnoJo ME7 |BuueuO LIZ06 BAISTPNET TH A SIA A S SO SIl!H AueAe 12 events under Public Resources Code 21166 and CEQA Guidelines Tit. 14, Section
13 15162(a)(1)(2)(3) have occurred and trigger that a Project-specific supplemental Environmental
14 Impact Report (EIR) be required; substantial changes in circumstances have taken place that, as
15 evidenced by the imposition of three new mitigation strategies onto the Project by the City,
16 require major revisions to the Warner Center 2035 Plan EIR, and bring the Project out of
17 compliance with the Warner Center 2035 Plan EIR (Cal. Code Regs. Tit. 14 Section
18 15162[a][1][2]); new empirical facts have become available as of March 2021 that were not
19 known and could not have been known at the time the Warner Center 2035 Plan EIR was
facts constitute "substantial evidence ... that the project 20 certified on October 23, 2013; these new
21 may have a significant effect on the environment" requiring the preparation of a project-specific
22 EIR (PRC Section 21080[d]); this "substantial evidence includes fact ... [and] expert opinion
23 supported by fact" (PRC Section 21080[e][1]). Moreover, contrary to the City's claims
24 otherwise, exceptions in CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2 to categorical exemptions have
25 taken place and apply to the Project.
26 27. The Project applicant conducted a Phase 2 Site 2 Assessment that consisted of soil-

vapor testing in six bore holes underneath the subterranean parking garage at 21515 W.
2 Vanowen on March 19, 2021. Contamination of tetrachloroethene (PCE) was found in soil-vapor
3 samples underneath the surface of the Project Site and was attributed to the migration of
4 groundwater northward off of the Raytheon-Canoga Avenue Facility site across the street.

"new information that was not known and could not have been known at the time the Program 28. The discovery, on March 19, 2021, of PCE underlying the Project Site constitutes

EIR was certified" and meets the standard of a triggering event under PRC Section
8 21166(a)(b)(c) to require that the Project undergo a supplemental EIR. The reasons to
9  substantiate this assertion are as follows: Because of the empirical discovery of PCE underneath
10 21515 W. Vanowen and its attribution to the off-site source of the Raytheon-Canoga Avenue
11 Facility site, the City imposed three additional Mitigation Measures as part of the final Letter of 8 d11 'dnoJo ME7 Channel -LZ06 12 Determination, dated May 25, 2021: HAZ-2A, HAZ-2B, and HAZ-2C. These additional
8 euns "pAla eujys|IM €888 'SIlH ÁueAea 14  consistently applied across the Specific Plan area and demonstrate that the new knowledge of 13 mitigation measures are not part of the Warner Center 2035 Plan EIR and therefore will not be

15 PCE at the Project Site required "revisions to the program EIR due to the involvement of a new
significant effect or a substantial increase in the severity of a previously identified effect"
17 (Governor's Office of Planning and Research, Chapter 10 CEQA, p. 274). The discovery of PCE 16

18 underneath the Project Site sparked these "substantial changes in the plan" by way of new
19 Project Conditions "that were not described in the program EIR" (Governor's Office of Planning
20 and Research, Chapter 10 CEQA, p. 274). These new Mitigation Measures are not within the
21 scope of the program EIR (see Sierra Club v. County of Sonoma [1992] 6 Cal.App.4th 1307) and
meet the test in PRC 21166(a) as "substantial changes ... proposed in the project which will
23 require major revisions of the environmental impact report." Importantly, the Warner Center 22

24 2035 Plan EIR did not anticipate the migration of toxic contamination generated on off-site
25 sources to properties for which there was no historical activities involving contaminants of
26 concern (COC), which is precisely the new circumstance which meets the test in PRC Section

9 27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 21166(b): "Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project
2 is being undertaken which will require major revisions in the environmental impact report."
3 These major revisions comprise HAZ-2A and HAZ-2B, which constitute "[a]dditional mitigation
4 measures and alternatives" that "may also be applied when a subsequent or supplemental EIR is
5 prepared."

6 29. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion
7 by failing to comply with the procedures outlined in the CEQA Guidelines and failing to conduct
8 the adequate environmental review for the Project. Accordingly, Respondent's environmental
9 determination must be set aside.
10 NOTICE OF COMMENCEMENT OF CEOA PROCEEDING

Honorable Attorney General Bonta:

Enclosed please find a copy of the Petition for Writ of Mandate filed by Clean Up Warner Center Contamination to challenge the City of Los Angeles' approval of the proposed development project at 21507-21529 West Vanowen Street ("Project"). The project would consist of the demolition of one, two-story commercial office building totaling approximately 53,412 square feet and the construction of a new, eight-story, approximately 85 feet in height, 166,995 square-foot in area, single-phase, multi-family residential building. Among other things, Petitioner contends that the Project is not eligible for a statutory exemption from CEQA pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 65457.
