18 Petitioner St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California ("St. Luke's") brings this Verified
19 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for. Declaratory and Injunctive Relief against Respondent
20 City of La Mesa (the "City") for its failure to comply with the procedural and substantive requirements
21 of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"; Public Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq.) in
22 approving the demolition of the La Mesa Woman's Club ("LMWC") and the construction of a mixed
23 luse development project at 5220 Wilson Street in La Mesa, California in its place (the "Project") as
24 proposed by real party in interest, CityMark Communities LLC (the "Developer"), as well as violations
25 of the City's joint duties to retain public records (Gov. Code §§ 6200 et seq., 34090 ct seq.; Pub. Res.
26 Code § 21167.6(e); collectively, the "Record Retention Laws") and disclose public records ("CPRA";
27 Gov. Code §§ 6250 et seq.) which serve to inform the Project's true scope and the impacts it will
28 produce on the environment. ST. LUKE'S alleges as follows:

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM1

INTRODUCTION

2 1. Extensive evidence presented by the community, and subject matter experts, detailing
3 the Project's impacts on the environment with respect to traffic, noise, air quality, stormwater runoff,
4 public safety, and historical resources, along with internal communications amongst the City's own
5 lexperts acknowledging many such impacts, was summarily ignored, and the public and
6 decisionmakers were misdirected in the adoption of a California Code of Regulations, Title 14
7 ("CEQA Guidelines"), § 15332 notice of exemption (the "NOE") so that the Project could avoid
8 environmental review.

2. By way of example, multiple, independent, and well-qualified experts opined that the
10 LMWC is eligible for historic designation due to, amongst other things, the organization's association
11 with events that have made a significant contribution to the history of La Mesa (e.g., the creation of
12 the Friend of the La Mesa Library organization which helped build the City's first library, housing that
13 first La Mesa library within the LMWC, and extensive campaigns to support World War I efforts and

14 to incorporate the City), the distinctive Modern Contemporary character of the LMWC indicative of
15 that specific type, period, and method of construction, that the LMWC was the last work of the notable
16 architect, Herluf Brydegaard, whose architecture has previously been deemed historic and is notable
17 due to its high artistic values, and the LMWC's association with the lives of persons of significance in
18 La Mesa's past. Moreover, these same experts opined that the Developer's historical analysis was
19 fatally deficient in that it noted some of the LMWC's historical characteristics but dismissed them as
20 unworthy of preservation without reasoned basis. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5 ['"The inquiry in such a
21 case shall extend to the questions whether the respondent has procecded without, or in excess of,
22 jurisdiction; whether there was a fair trial; and whether there a was any prejudicial abuse of discretion.
23 Abuse of discretion is established if the respondent has not proceeded in the manner required by law,
24 the order or decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not supported by the
25 evidence."].)

26 3. Compounding matters, the City's own experts repeatedly opined that the LMWC is
27 eligible for historic preservation, and then prepared, and transmitted to the Developer, extensive
28 documentation relating to the historic aspects of the site. But, when asked to provide this same
2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM2

linformation to the Petitioner, the City claimed this documentation longer existed - in direct violation
2 of its requirements to retain and/or disclose such records so that the public and decisionmakers have
3 information relevant to the Project's scope and impacts on the environment. (Sierra Club v. County of
4 Fresno (2018) 6 Cal.5th 502, 515 ["failure to comply with the law subverts the purposes of CEQA"
5 and constitutes prejudicial error "if it omits material necessary to informed decisionmaking and
6 informed public participation"]; Golden Door Properties LLC v. Sup. Ct. (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 733,
7 790 [disclosure of records relating to a development to developer require disclosure to the public].)

8 4. Further, upon learning that Petitioner sought, and recovered, the City's own
9 communications decrying the Project's impacts on the environment, Respondent changed its tack by
10 |denying Petitioner the disclosure of internal correspondence in preparation of staff reports, arguing
11 that it was not required to retain such public records in direct violation of its duties under CEQA, the
12 CPRA, and the Record Retention Laws. "[I]f the manner in which an agency failed to follow the law
13 is shown to be prejudicial, or is presumptively prejudicial, as when the department or the board fails
14 to comply with mandatory procedures, ...the decision [must] bè set aside .s. ." (Sierra Club V. State Bd.
15 of Forestry (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1215, 1236.)

16 5. The Project's baseline conditions were inaccurately described as well. For instance,
17 the Community Development Director and the Developer's traffic consultant both claimed, without
18 evidence in the record, that the intersection fronting the proposed development, at Wilson Street and
19 Grossmont Boulevard was safe and had only experienced one (1) vehicular accident in recent history.
20 Notwithstanding the fact that Petitioner presented the City's own police reports reflecting four (4) such
21 accidents, and the concerns raised by the community members most familiar with this intersection's
22 hazards, as well as the City staff's internal. communications recommending further analysis and
23 mitigation measures, the City abused its discretion by turning blind eye to the Project's exacerbation
24 of an already dangerous condition. In furtherance of this point, the subject intersection at Wilson Street
25 and Grossmont Boulevard suffered another serious vehicular accident on November 19, 2021, soon
26 after the City claimed no concern for increasing the traffic intensity in this location without considered
27 analysis. (Exhibit A - Photographs of vehicles involved in the Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street
28 intersection traffic accident which occurred at approximately 11 AM on November 19, 2021.) The
3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM3

City's blatant disregard for this dangerous condition, and the impacts which will be generated by the
2 proposed Project's residents, guests, commercial tenants, and customers is a clear and prejudicial abuse
3 lof discretion. The Legislature declares that it is the policy of this state to "take all action necessary to
4 protect, rehabilitate, and enhance the environmental quality of the state." [Citation.] [Citation.] (Id. at
5 p. 1229.)

6 6. It is not only the public which has been harmed by the City's failures to follow the law
- its own decisionmakers have been bamboozled by staff who patently misrepresent the facts, as noted
8 Jabove, and alter them when inconvenient. The City's Design Review Board ("DRB"), which board
9 consists of land use, planning and architectural experts, critically reviewed the Project's proposed
10 street improvements indicating concerns over its public safety impacts. When the DRB boardmembers
11 determined a traffic analysis was necessary to identify street improvements to mitigate the Project's
12 impacts, City staff made efforts to blunt the condition (since this would clearly indicate that a CEQA
13 exemption could not be granted). First, staff unlawfully claimed the traffic analysis could be provided
14 after the NOE was adopted, at the "construction drawing" stage ~ in clear violation of CEQA's
15 prohibition against deferred environmental analysis. (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com.
16 (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 134 [CEQA's "substantive mandate [requires] that public agencies refrain from
17 approving projects for which there are feasible alternatives or mitigation measures," and that an agency
18 not approve a project for which significant environmental effects have been identified unless the
19 lagency makes specific findings about alternatives and mitigation measures.) Then, upon the DRB's

20 imposition of this traffic analysis condition, in an astonishingly brazen move, City staff surreptitiously
21 eliminated this traffic analysis condition altogether when presenting the DRB's conditional approval
22Nlto the La Mesa Planning Commission and Council, and falsely denied the existence of said condition
23 when raised by Petitioner. City staff had no authority to countermand the DRB's conditional approval.
24 Nor can there be any legitimate basis justifying such willful misinformation to decisionmakers and the
25 public. The resulting process was not a fair or legitimate adjudication of the facts underlying the
26 Project.

27 7. Further, the City's ham-handed efforts to avoid CEQA analysis by use of the NOE are
28 clearly evident in that the Project was in fact conditioned to (1) construct crosswalk improvements and
4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM4

(2) make a five thousand dollar ($5,000) contribution towards unspecified future improvements at the
2 lintersection of Wilson Street and Grossmont Boulevard. Such mitigation measures are plainly
3 lindicative of the fact the Project will generate impacts requiring ameliorative action. Yet, when
4 presented with this point, the City staff falsely claimed the Developer "volunteered" to provide these
5 things, rather than being required by the City to do so. This dissembling was exposed, and presented
6 to both Planning Commission and City Council, through the staff's internal correspondence plainly
7 |discussing desire to impose each of these conditions on the Developer to mitigate the Project's
8 impacts. Once again, the facts were blatantly ignored. No rational developer would simply volunteer
9 to give money to the City unless required for approval of its for-profit business venture. Nor can the
10 City point to any fund, or approved fee schedule, previously established by the Council dictating that
11 la five thousand dollars ($5,000) contribution to be a "standard condition" of a development of this
12 aature. Rather, putting the facts, the staff s own words, and common sense aside, the City prejudicially
13 labused its discretion by approving these mitigation measures on the Project and simultaneously
14 claiming no CEQA review was required.

15 8. Though the Project is proposed directly next door to an elementary school, and across
16 the street from an exclusively senior residential community, no effort was made to investigate the
17 impacts of the construction noise, and/or air quality, impacts, Instead, the City relies upon its "standard
18 conditions" to mitigate the Project's expected impacts in these categories. But this argument makes
19 little sense. For instance, the City's noise ordinance only restricts noise levels at night (between 10
20 p.m. and 7 a.m.), but the elementary school is only open for instruction in the daytime, such that no
21 limitations exist with respect to the construction noise arising from grading almost ninety percent
22 (90%) of a nearly one (1) acre site. The City has no substantial evidence upon which to rely that the
23 construction noise associated approximately one thousand eight hundred (1,800) cubic yards of
24 grading operations, along with the heavy trucks required to haul dirt to and from the site, will not pose
25 a significant noise impact on these sensitive receptors. What is evident is that the proximal school site
26 will be forced to absorb the noise and dust from the construction of the Project, especially in light of
27 the now commonly understood need for good air circulation arising from the COVID-19 pandemic,
28 requiring classrooms to open their windows to lessen viral circulation. Again, the City turned a blind
5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM5

leye, and prejudicially abused its discretion without substantial evidence to support its position.

9. These and other violations of law detailed in extensive written and oral presentations to
(the City have all been summarily ignored in the adoption of the NOE, resulting in serious and
4 prejudicial errors which this Court must now remedy by directing the City to provide the Petitioner,
5 the public, and the City's decisionmakers, all necessary and accurate information to conclude the true
6 scope of the Project and its impacts, and to require the preparation of an environmental impact report
7 ("EIR"). (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 113 [*Whenever
8 la project may have a significant a and adverse physical effect on the environment, an EIR must be
9 prepared and certified. [Citations.]"].)

10 THE PARTIES

11 10. At all relevant times mentioned herein, Petitioner is a California non-stock corporation
12 operating as a religious institution at 5150 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California, and its property includes
13 an elementary school (pre-kindergarten through fifth grade) onsite known as the Warren Walker La
14 Mesa Lower School.

15 11. Petitioner, like much of the public, is concerned about the City's failure to observe and
16 abide by the laws intended to protect the community from unmitigated impacts arising from the
17 Project's development. Accordingly, St. Luke's has a direct and beneficial interest in the City's
18 compliance with CEQA, the CPRA, and the Record Retention Laws.
19 12. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondent is a
20 municipality organized under the laws of the State of California and has general land use authority
21 lover the Project site, is responsible for reviewing entitlement requests for the Project, and approving
22 or denying such requests.

23 13. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondent functions as
24 the "lead agency" under CEQA for purposes of assessing the Project for environmental impacts and
25 disclosing that assessment to the public, and as the lead agency Respondent must comply with the
26 procedural and substantive requirements of CEQA.

27 14. Petitioner is further informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondent is a
28 "local agency" under the CPRA and as a local agency is required to permit the inspection, or provide
6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM6

copies, of identifiable public records upon request by Petitioner.

2 15. Petitioner is further informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Respondent is a
3 city, and that the Respondent is subject to the Record Retention Laws.

16. Petitioner is further informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Developer is a
5 limited liability company organized and existing under the laws of the State of California, and is
6 lidentified as the applicant for the Project, and the NOE, approved and/or adopted by the Respondent
7 and challenged by this lawsuit.

8 17. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents and/or Real
9 Parties in Interest fictitiously named herein as Does through 20, inclusive, and is unaware of any
10 other parties required to be named under applicable law. Petitioner will amend this petition and
11 complaint, with leave of the Court, if necessary, to allege the fictitiously named parties' true names
12 and capacities if ascertained.

'13 JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND STANDING
14 18. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged herein pursuant to Code of Civil
15 Procedure §§ 1060, 1085, and 1094.5; Government Code §§ 6203, 6258, and 6259; Public Resources
16 Code §§ 21168 and 21168.5.

17 19. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing the instant lawsuit, including
18 but not limited to, exhausting all administrative remedies by objecting to the City's violations of CEQA
19 and making all administrative appeals of such legislative bodies having authority over the Project.
20 20. Petitioner has also requested public records from the City under the CPRA, and has
21 been unlawfully denied the right to inspect, and or to be provided with copies of, certain records
22 without legitimate basis.

23 21. Petitioner is further excused from any conditions precedent to filing the instant lawsuit,
24 lif any exist, by futility, lack of jurisdiction, and/or the unavailability of any other timely review,
25 including without limitation the failure of the City to provide timely public notice, public hearings, or
26 other proceedings.

27 22. Venue is proper in this Court because all known parties to this lawsuit are located within
28 the County of San Diego County and the alleged violations occurred in the County of San Diego.
7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM7

23. Petitioner has standing to assert its claims because it has a material interest in the
2 Project's impacts on the environment as they relate to the neighboring community, and in ensuring
3 lthat the City abides by the laws of the State of California in providing transparency in its governance
4 of this community, by and through its retention and disclosure of public records.

4 16, 2021 CPRA request is attached hereto as Exhibit N.

5 38. On July 21, 2021, the City's Planning Commission held a public hearing on St. Luke's
6 appeal of the March 8, 2021 Development Advisory Board's determination to approve the Project and
7 adopt the NOE. St. Luke's objected to the Project's approval and the NOE in a writing delivered prior
8 to said public hearing, and additional objections were presented orally on Petitioner's behalf during

9 |the course of said hearing. City staff and the City's legal counsel directed the Planning Commissioners
10 lthat they could not deny the Project, or the adoption of the NOE based upon, amongst other things, the
11 development's impacts on historical resources (that is, the LMWC) notwithstanding multiple subject
12 matter experts offering substantial evidence and opining on this point prior to, and during, the public
13 hearing. Instead, Planning Commissioners were directed that could only rely upon the Developer's
14 historical analysis. Thereafter, the Planning Commission voted unanimously to deny the Project and
15 co uphold the Project's approval as well as the adoption of the NOE. A true and correct copy of St.
16 Luke's written objections is attached hereto as Exhibit 0 and its content is fully incorporated by
17 reference as though set forth herein in its entirety.

18 39. On July 27, 2021, St. Luke's submitted a CPRA request to the City for public records

22 Luke's appeal is attached hereto as Exhibit Q and its content is fully incorporated by reference as
23 |though set forth herein in its entirety.

24 41. On August 9, 2021, the City replied to St. Luke's July 27, 2021 CPRA request
25 indicating it required additional time due to unusual circumstances, but estimated production of the
26 responsive records would be made by August 23, 2021. A true and correct copy of the City's August
27 9, 2021 cover letter is attached hereto as Exhibit R.

28 42. On August 23, 2021, the City replied, via email, to St. Luke's July 27, 2021 CPRA
10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM10

request by producing some of the responsive records, indicating others did not exist, and yet others
2 required additional time to produce. A true and correct copy of the City's August 23, 2021 email is
3 lattached hereto as Exhibit S.

4 43. On August 30, 2021, the City provided ten (10) additional records responsive to St.

10 Isaid production and requested the City redouble its effort to produce specific documents referenced in
11 the record production, including Project-related staff reports and internal communications, public
12 comments, and historical resource records regarding the LMWC previously provided to the Developer
13 and/or its agent(s). A true and correct copy of St. Luke's October 6, 2021 email requesting follow up
14 on the July 27, 2021 CPRA request is attached hereto as Exhibit U.

15 45. On October 18, 2021, the City responded, via email, to St. Luke's October 6, 2021
16 CPRA follow up request, providing several responsive records but indicating that some staff
17 communications and reports were "drafts that no longer exist" and that the LMWC historic resource
18 frecords previously provided to the Developer and/or its agent(s) could not be found. A true and correct
19 copy of the City's October 18, 2021 email is attached hereto as Exhibit V.

20 46. Thereafter, between October 18, 2021 and October 20, 2021, St. Luke's and the City
21 corresponded with one another, via email, regarding the City's missing staff communications and
22 reports, and the LMWC historic resource records failed to produce to Petitioner but made available to
23 the Developer and/or its agents. The City stopped providing responses on this topic when asked
24 directly if the historic resource records were not retained. At no time previously, or thereafter, did the
25 City provide the referenced staff communications and reports, or the LMWC historic resource records
26 provided to the Developer and/or its agent. A true and correct copy of said email exchange between
27 St. Luke's and the City is attached hereto as Exhibit W.

28 47. On October 26, 2021, the City Council for the City heard St. Luke's appeal of the

PWM11

Planning Commission's July 21, 2021 determination to uphold the Development Advisory Board's
2 March 8, 2021 approval of the Project and adoption of the NOE. St. Luke's objected to the Project's
3 lapproval and the NOE in a writing delivered prior to said public hearing, and additional objections
4 were presented orally on Petitioner's behalf during the course of said hearing. The Council denied St.
5 Luke's appeal and approved the Project and adoption of the NOE on a 3 to 1 vote. A true and correct
6 copy of St. Luke's written objections is attached hereto as Exhibit X and its content is fully
7 lincorporated by reference as though set forth herein in its entirety.
8 48. On October 27, 2021, the City filed the NOE with the County of San Diego. A true and

9 correct copy of the filed NOE is attached hereto as Exhibit Y.

10 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (VIOLATION OF CEQA)

12 49. St. Luke's realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs I through 48 above, as
13 though set forth herein in their entirety.

14 50. An actual and justiciable controversy has arisen and now exists between Petitioner and
15 the City concerning the adoption of the NOE resulting in the Project's exemption from CEQA review.

16 51. Though perfection is not required of the City, CEQA exemptions may not be exploited
17 to avoid environmental analysis by ignoring substantial evidence reflecting clear and undeniable
18 exceptions to the NOE in light of the Project's significant impacts with respect to traffic, noise, air
19 quality, stormwater runoff, public safety, and historical resources.

20 52. The City's failure or refusal to disclose public records relevant to the significant effects
21 of the Project violates CEQA by limiting the public's, and decisionmakers' understanding of the
22 Project's true scope, baseline, and/or impacts resulting in a prejudicial abuse of discretion improperly
23 favoring circumvention of environmental review.

24 53. The City's unlawful reliance upon mitigation measures it imposed to limit traffic and
25 public safety impacts does not justify the grant of exemption from CEQA review. Rather, such
26 Imitigation measures indicate the Project does, in fact, generate impacts which the City has implicitly
27 determined require amelioration. Thus, the NOE is illegitimate in light of the Project's recognized
28 impacts with respect to traffic and public safety.
12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

54. The DRB conditioned its approval of the Project by requiring the preparation of a traffic
a 2 study. Such a condition acknowledges the development's potentially significant impacts on public
safety and traffic in light of the Project's increase use of a roadway recognized as impaired. In so
doing, the City tacitly admits the NOE cannot be granted in light of the Project's significant impacts
5 on the environment. Moreover, the DRB was misdirected to require this traffic study condition well
6 past the conclusion of the CEQA process, resulting in an unlawful deferred analysis of the Project's
7 impacts in further violation of the law. The City's efforts to then avoid the consequences of this
8 Junlawful deferment, wherein its staff unilaterally altered the legislative body's determination by
9 altogether striking this traffic study condition (and then falsely testifying the condition did not exist)
10 only serves to highlight the impropriety of granting the NOE and puts into question the credibility of
11 all other claims made by the City with respect to the Project's impacts on the environment.

12 55. The City also failed to consider the Project's effects on sensitive receptors. Instead, the
13 ICity improperly relies upon plainly ineffective standards which do nothing to mitigate the noise and
14 air quality/dust impacts resulting from the proposed construction on school children and senior citizens
15 proximate to the subject site without consideration of appropriate mitigation measures to alleviate such
16 imminently distressful conditions.

17 56. The public interest in resolving the controversy is substantial. The public has a
18 significant interest in ensuring the City properly analyze the Project's environmental impacts and direct
19 proper mitigation measures accordingly.

20 57. Writ relief is required to correct the City's abuses. of discretion resulting in violations
21 of CEQA.

6 in the controversy alleged.

21 adequate environmental review as required by CEQA.

22 69. St. Luke's has no adequate remedy at law to prevent the unlawful implementation of

10 Istaff reports regarding the Project.

11 76. Such public records were prepared, owned, used, and/or retained by the City, and are
12 owed to the public, including St. Luke's, upon request under the CPRA:

13 77. The City has a clear, present ministerial duty to properly respond to CPRA requests and
14 has no legitimate claim to any CPRA exemptions with respect to said public records requested by St.
15 Luke's. Nor may the City claim any CPRA exemption as to those public records which it has
16 previously disclosed to others, as it did with respect to certain materials requested by St. Luke's.

19 understanding as to how the City conduct's the people's business with respect to the Project.

Re: Project No. 2020-16 (CityMark Communities LLC) - 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, CA
Dear Ms. Kinnard:
This law firm represents the St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California located at 5150 Wilson Street, directly adjacent to the La Mesa Woman's Club (LMWC**), the site of a 49 residential unit and three commercial unit mixed-use project ("Project") proposed by CityMark Communities LLC ("CityMark") known as Project No. 2020-16. This correspondence is offered to inform the City of La Mesa ("City") of our client's grave concerns regarding the proposed Project, the limited conditions recommended to ensure the health and safety of the public, and the apparent lack of analysis of the Project's expected impacts.
We also wish to bring to the City's attention that on December 17, 2020 this firm requested to be placed on the notice list for all public hearings relating to the Project, and specifically those relating to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Notwithstanding this, we were only sent notice of the March 8, 2021, 12:30 p.m. Design Review Board ("DRB") meeting after regular work. hours, at 8:10 p.m., on Thursday, March 4, 2021 (see Attachment "1"), indicating that the City requires audio/visual presentations by the public to be submitted by "12:00 noon, one business day prior to the start of the meeting.' It would be practically impossible to prepare and transmit any presentation, let alone a thoughtful one, within three regular working hours of receipt of said notice (i.e., after 9 a.m. on March 5, 2021) to comply with the City's stated deadline. What is more, no notice was sent to this office of the March 8, 2021, 10 a.m. Development Advisory Board ("DAB") meeting though we understand that an exemption to CEQA analysis is to be voted on in this hearing. In fact, it is solely due to our client's diligence in searching the City's website, at approximately 11:15 am on March 5, 2021, that we learned of the DAB meeting at all again, making it impossible to provide the City with an audio/visual presentation by the 12:00 noon deadline set for that same day.
We understand that COVID-19 has altered the conditions by which we all live and work, and that the City is permitted to avoid direct communications from the public during such hearings

in light of California Executive Order N-29-20. Yet, the failure to afford the public a practical opportunity to review, analyze, and respond to the Project's 137-page DRB staff report and the 150-page DAB staff report does not comport with the public's statutory and constitutional rights to petition its government under the Ralph M. Brown Act. (Government Code 54950 et seq.; Cal. Const., Art. I 3, subd. (a) and (b)(1), (7).) These actions run afoul of the law as they present limitations on public participation which are simply "too arbitrary and capricious, too restrictive and unreasonable." (Nevens V. Chino (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 775, 778; see also Robins v. Pruneyard Shopping Center (1979) 23 Cal.3d 899, 907 [The right of the people to petition the

Furthermore, should CityMark, or its consultants, be permitted to present audio/visual materials to, or communicate directly with, the DAB or DRB boards during these hearings on March 8, 2021 it will only heighten the inequities inherent in providing late, or no, notice to the public, with regard to the respective rights of the parties to petition their government. This would be an unfortunate, and likely unlawful, action in unequal treatment under both state and federal statutes and constitutions. A more reasoned action would be to postpone cach of the DAB and DRB hearings by a week, or more, to permit cach party, and the public more generally, an opportunity to present their positions thoughtfully.
Notwithstanding this, we offer a limited summary of our client's position with respect to the proposed Project in the hopes that it will be presented to the DAB and DRB board members for review prior to any discussion of, or determination on, this matter. In light of the severely constrained time available to us before the DAB and DRB meetings, we will not reiterate cach of the points made in prior communications and correspondence delivered to the City in opposition to the Project but join in those comments by this reference. Rather, we will focus briefly on the inadequate analysis of the Project in light of the City's General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, the Project's inapt use of California State Density Bonus Law (Gov. Code § 65915 et seq.) § waivers,
and the impropriety of the claimed CEQA exemption under Guidelines section 15332.

I. The Project Runs Afoul Of The General Plan's Urban Design Element And The
Zoning Ordinance
As the staff reports to each of the DAB and DRB indicate, the Project site is designated as "Mixed Use Urban," corresponding to the Mixed Use (MU) Overlay, in the Residential Business
base zone and is intended to support "pedestrian friendly housing." (DAB Staff Report, p. 2; DRB Staff Report, p.2.) Notwithstanding this, the Project seeks to avoid the very features it is obligated to provide to enable pedestrian-friendly housing.

The Project sits under 100 feet away, directly across Grossmont Boulevard, from the Grossmont Shopping Center. The closest supermarket to the Project is the Walmart Neighborhood Market therein, lying approximately 350 feet away, yet because there is no crosswalk, stop sign, and/or traffic signal at the intersection of Wilson Street and Grossmont Boulevard, a resident of the Project would be required to walk about three-quarters of a mile to safely cross the street, pick up groceries, and return with them - it is doubtful many residents will be able to lug an average family's weekly groceries this distance, on foot. (DAB Staff Report, p. 2 [In fact, the City recognizes this failing at the beginning of its report, "The intersection is not signalized and iS lacking curb ramps and crosswalks."]; see also DRB Staff Report at p. 2 for the same acknowledgment of a dangerous condition].) Notwithstanding this, it appears the Project is being permitted to avoid the development of a crosswalk which is absolutely necessary for its residents or, at least, providing an analysis showing the Project will generate significantly more average daily vehicular trips and vehicle miles traveled than contemplated.
The City failed to require a traffic analysis for the Project, though it initially sought to require an ADA-compliant ramp be constructed at this intersection before apparently dropping this condition altogether. Our client's environmental consultant has also indicated this intersection is
particularly dangerous because of limited sightlines arising from a substantial curve in Grossmont Boulevard in this arca. The observation that this particular intersection is dangerous has been voiced numerous times in correspondence submitted to the City by multiple parties. Yet the staff reports show that no ramp, crosswalk, or analysis was required of the Project - instead, the Project is conditioned to provide a $5,000 "fair-share" payment toward a ramp to be built by an unknown party at an unknown time in the future. This does not comport with the law.
There appears to be no plan on file to develop a safe intersection at Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street, and the $5,000 payment does not appear to go towards any previously approved fund for that purpose. Nor is there any indication of how this figure was calculated. In Anderson First. Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173, the appellate court held that paying a "fair-share fee" is permissible as effective mitigation only if the fees are "part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency commits itself to implementing." That is not the case in this instance. In light of this, the City must require the installation of an appropriately signalized intersection, or some other traffic calming feature here, or require the Project to present an analysis indicating why it should not do so. The only evidence in the administrative record, to date, on this topic shows that the City initially desired a crosswalk to be installed but backed off without explanation (or analysis available to the public, or the City's decisionmakers).
"In MU areas, new development is required to include pedestrian rcalm improvements along collector streets to encourage pedestrian activity. The Circulation Element classifies Grossmont Boulevard as a major collector street subject to pedestrian realm requirements." (DAB Staff Report, p. 2; DRB Staff Report, p. 2. [Emphasis added.]; see also La Mesa Municipal Code

§ 24.18.040(B).) The condition to pay a fee in lieu of an actual mitigation measure regarding a known project impact runs afoul of CEQA and should not be permitted. Rather the Project must be required to perform an analysis to determine the scope of the impact and to then propose a mitigation measure to reduce that impact to a less than significant level.
Moreover, this mitigation measure is improper on two other bases. First, it improperly attempts to defer mitigation until a later (and, in this case, unknown future) time. This is specifically forbidden under CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4 (a)(1)(B).) And second, a mitigation mcasure is only available if a project under CEQA is expected to generate a potentially significant impact on the environment, but the staff report indicates that the Project is exempt from CEQA because there are no such expected impacts. (DAB Staff Report, p. 7-8; see also DAB Staff Report, Attachment A, "Resolution No. DAB-2021-xx" at Par. 1.) So, either the Project is not exempt from CEQA and cannot be conditioned to mitigate a potentially significant impact, or it must be analyzed properly under CEQA (i.e., by preparation of an Initial Study, followed by specific impact - category studies, and the development of a mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report). The status quo does not comport with the law. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County f Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102 [a public agency may not adopt mitigation measures for a project for the purpose of qualifying it for a categorical CEQA exemption; see also Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster
(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1200.)
A. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Limited To Overcoming Physical, Not Financial, Constraints Such That Avoiding Improvements To The Pedestrian Realm Are Not Permitted For This Project
As indicated above, the Project is designated Mixed Use Urban requiring improvements to the surrounding pedestrian realm. LMMC § 24.18.020(E) defines the term "pedestrian realm" as
follows:

"Pedestrian realm" means a twelve-foot wide area located between the face of the curb of a Circulation Element designated street and the face of the building. The pedestrian realm includes the parkway, sidewalk, and landscaped areas. The pedestrian realm may include both public and private property where the public right-of-way is not twelve feet wide. Pedestrian amenities, street trees, street furniture, bus stop facilities, and other landscaping, as specified in this chapter, shall be included in the public realm.
Notwithstanding this acknowledged requirement, "[wJaivers are being requested to allow reductions in... pedestrian realm requirements." (DAB Staff Report, p. 3; DRB Staff Report, p. 3.) For instance, the Project seeks a "waiver" under the State Density Bonus Law so that it may encroach four feet into the pedestrian realm along Grossmont Boulevard by installing balconies hanging over this right of way. This miscomprehends what a waiver is under the law.

PWM56

Pursuant to Government Code §65915(e)(1), waivers (as opposed to incentives) are afforded to a density bonus project only when a "development standard will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development," not because the developer desires it, or because it will enhance the financial prospects of a project. Put another way, a waiver permits deviation from, or altogether evasion of, regulations which affect a project due to its site-specific physical features. This subject site has no such physical constraints. Rather, the balconies could be built outside of the pedestrian realm (i.e., within the building envelope) by moving the exterior walls along Grossmont Boulevard back four feet, or removed altogether. The applicant itself makes clear that it is not a physical constraint that drives this waiver request when it states its justification as follows:
This waiver is requested due to excessive space and cost impacts to incorporate the Open Space requirement and private balconies. The loss of development potential to incorporate this would make the project infeasible to provide the affordable units.
As mentioned above, the site itself does not have any physical obstruction which precludes construction of these balconies, rather CityMark simply desires to have them overhang the pedestrian realm because it would increase their financial incentive to develop the Project. The State Density Bonus Law permits this sort of deviation from regulation for financial gain through the use of incentives, of which the Project has two (waivers, on the other hand, are unlimited for such developments). Yet, the Project avoids using any of its incentives and instead improperly requests at least five waivers to avoid its open space requirements, building height limit, parking space sizing, landscaping required within the pedestrian realm, and overall parking requirements. In each such instance, CityMark indicates that the justification for the waiver is not a physical constraint unique to the site but rather the request is made to seek a financial boon for the developer.

The reason the Project seeks to use waivers rather than incentives is clear on its face the State Density Bonus Law does not authorize a sufficient number of incentives (i.e., the Project requires five, but only has two available to it) to meet CityMark's desired financial goals, whereas it may request an unlimited number of waivers. Because it does not have sufficient incentives to develop the Project in this manner, it attempts to avoid their use altogether and instead make faulty justifications for waivers which are impermissible under the law.
Because CityMark cannot show a physical constraint exists which limits the development of the Project under the City's laws and policies, it must use its incentives (and justify the use of those incentives by showing the financial benefit gained thereby) and/or redesign the Project to be in conformity with the law.

B. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Not Permitted To Overcome Regulations That
Pertain To Health And Safety
As mentioned above, the Project's requests for waivers are inapposite to the law because they pertain to financial rather than physical constraints. In addition, the Project improperly seeks to waive the City's standard parking space and driving aisle dimensions even though this would result in direct health and safety impacts. Waivers are impermissible on this
basis as well.
The dimensions of parking spaces and adjacent driving aisles are specified to ensure the safety of vehicles, their drivers and passengers, and pedestrians. (LMMC § 22.112.010(B).) This makes common sense - if spaces and driving aisles are too small, or otherwise constrained, they are likelier to lead to physical harm from other vehicles when vacating or entering a space and are the reason why State building codes requires minimum parking dimensions to ensure health and safety. (DAB Staff Report, p. 3 & Attachment D, pp. 3-4; DRB Staff Report, p. 3 & Attachment
E, pp. 3-4.)
Government Code section 65915(e)(1) of the State Density Bonus Law provides:
Nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted to require a local government to waive or reduce development standards if the waiver or reduction would have a specific, adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5, upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact.
[Emphasis added.]
a Thus, a waiver cannot be used to avoid the specific, adverse impact arising from the reduction of a basic safety feature inherent in parking stall/space sizes and driving aisle dimensions as contemplated by the Project due to the health and safety issues it raises. No justification exists which would be sufficient to overcome this requested reduction in health and safety standards, nor would an incentive permit such a thing.
C. The Project, As Designed, Is Contrary To The Chief Land Use Policies Declared Under The Land Use And Urban Design Element Of The General Plan
California law requires each city and county to adopt a general plan, a comprehensive long- term plan for the development of that city or county, famously referred to by the state Supreme Court as the "constitution for future development." (Lesher Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 540.) A general plan must contain seven mandatory "elements," including a "land use element" to designate the level of intensity and general distribution of land uses. (Gov. Code § 65302.) "[T]he propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development depends upon [a finding of] consistency with the applicable general plan and its

PWM58

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
March 8, 2021
Page 7 of 13

elements." (Resource Defense Fund v. County of Santa Cruz (1982) 133 Cal.App.3rd 800, 806.) CEQA imposes an obligation on La Mesa to assess the Project's consistency with the City's General Plan. (North Coast Rivers Alliance et al. v. Marin Municipal Water District (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 614, 633.) The Project, as designed and proposed, cannot be found to be consistent with the Land Use and Urban Design Element of the City's General Plan.
By way of example:

1) Policy LU-1.2.2 requires that "[a]s part of the development review process, City departments will review all future development to ensure that safety requirements are met, including building and fire codes, accessibility standards and crime prevention techniques. Yet, as indicated above, the City's failure to ensure that the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street indicates that no such review has been performed (or that, if it has, the requirement to ensure safety has been obviated) such that a dangerous condition not only is permitted to exist, but it is being worsened by increasing the vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the area while also attempting to authorize a large development where a single-story structure currently exists, further reducing a sight lines on a dangerous curve in the road. Similarly, the proposed waivers to reduce parking space dimensions and drive aisle widths do not "ensure that safety requirements are met, including building and fire codes, [nor] accessibility standards.» 2) Policy LU-2.1.2 requires the City to "[s]upport infill development and subdivision proposals that reinforce neighborhood strengths and benefit neighborhood identity,' yet the Project proposes a development which is so different in character and intensity from any other in the neighborhood, both with respect to its architectural style and the materials used on its exterior walls - none of which can be found elsewhere in this community. Thus, it cannot be said that this Project will "reinforce" the existing visual appeal of the community. 3) Policy LU-2.1.5 requires the implementation of projects in the "Mixed-Use Overlay Zone by promoting the rehabilitation of properties and new development that fits into the context of the existing neighborhoods while meeting the City's Urban Design Objectives for infill development." Again, as noted directly above, in #2, the Project is completely out of character and context with respect to the existing neighborhood such that this policy cannot be met. 4) Policy LU-4.2.3 requires that "[n]ew development shall provide adequate parking.' As the Project specifically seeks to not only reduce parking space numbers below the City's normal standards, it also seeks to reduce the number below those permitted under the State Density Bonus Law (albeit, improperly attempting to do so via a waiver, as indicated in the immediately preceding two sections of this letter). Also, as indicated in the immediately preceding section, the Project does not provide adequate parking not only with respect to the reduced number of spaces it proposes, but also improperly attempts to reduce the dimensions of the spaces and the drive aisles around them in a manner likely to impact the public's (and future residents') health and safety. Thus, the Project clearly conflicts with this policy as well.
5) Objective UD-1.1 requires the City's "It]o protect La Mesa's existing built environment and cultural heritage." But the Project proposes to destroy the LMWC clubhouse

PWM59

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
March 8, 2021
Page 8 of 13

which has been in place for over half century and, thus, conflicts directly and inarguably with
this policy.
6) Objective UD-3.1 requires that development be "architecturally and environmentally sensitive and ...compatible with neighboring design and scale." As indicated in the discussions regarding Policy LU-1.2.2 and Policy LU-2.1.2 directly above, the Project is unlike anything in this neighborhood, especially with respect to its design and scale, and therefore, conflicts with this objective of the General Plan.
In short, the Project cannot be said to be in harmony with the City's General Plan Land Use and Urban Design Element as proposed. As such, it must be revised significantly to come into conformance with the General Plan, and the surrounding community.

II. The Project Fails To Comply With The California Environmental Quality Act
The primary purposes of CEQA are to inform City decisionmakers, as well as the public, about the potential impacts of a project, and to prescribe mitigation measures to avoid such impacts. CEQA requires a broad view of what constitutes a project requiring environmental analysis. (McQueen V. Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1143.) Even projects that appear benign will likely fall within the ambit of CEQA. (Bloom v. McGurk (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1307, 1312.) The California State Legislature formulated CEQA to "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of the environment shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions." (Pub. Res. Code §21001(d).) To implement this goal, CEQA requires municipalities to analyze discretionary projects for potential environmental impacts utilizing a three-tier system. (No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 74.) The first tier is known as a preliminary review. The preliminary review requires public agency staff to analyze a complete application in order to discern the full scope of the project at issue. (CEQA Guidelines section 15060(b); City of Pasadena v. The State of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 810, 836.) Once the parameters of the project are established, a determination is made to resolve whether an exemption is applicable to the project. If such an exemption is found, the agency must determine that no exceptions to the exemption are triggered by the potential impacts from the full scope of the project. (CEQA Guidelines §§ 15060, 15061.) If the project is not exempt from CEQA, or an exception is applicable, the is second tier of review is required wherein an initial study is prepared because it has been determined that there is a possibility that the project may have a significant effect on the environment. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063.) An initial study facilitates environmental assessment carly in the design of a project. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063(c).) In the third tier, the initial study is used to demonstrate that either: a) the project "will not have a significant effect," triggering the preparation of a negative declaration, or b) the project is one "which may have a significant effect on the environment," triggering the preparation of an environmental impact report ("EIR"). (CEQA Guidelines § 15064.)

PWM60

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
March 8, 2021
Page 9 of 13

While the Guidelines provide opportunities for projects to be exempted from CEQA review, these exemptions are limited in nature. "Only those projects having no significant effect on the environment are categorically exempt from CEQA review." (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network, supra, at p. 1102.) A significant effect is a "substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in the environment." (Pub. Res. Code §21068. [Emphasis added.J) This means that an activity has a significant effect if, among other things, it "has the potential to degrade the quality of the environment." (Pub. Res. Code § 21083.) "[A]n activity that may have a significant effect on the environment cannot be categorically exempt." (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal,4th 105, 124. [Emphasis added.])
The courts review categorical exemptions using strict construction in a manner affording the greatest environmental protection within the reasonable scope of the statutory language. (County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 966.) "[E]xemption categories are not to be expanded or broadened beyond the reasonable scope of their statutory language.' (Dehne v. County of Santa Clara (1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 827, 842.) Thus, an exemption must be applicable in light of the full scope of a project.
A public agency has the burden of proving that substantial evidence supports its factual finding that a project falls within the asserted exemption. (Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose, 54 Cal. App. 4th 106, 114-115 (1997); Magan v. County of Kings (2002) 105 Cal.App.4th 468, 475.) "An agency's duty to provide such factual support 'is all the more important where the record shows ...that opponents of the project have raised arguments regarding possible significant environmental impacts." (Muzzy Ranch Co. v. Solano County Airport Land Use Com. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 372, 386.) A city cannot impose a burden on the public to prove a possibility of adverse environmental impacts since this would frustrate CEQA's fundamental purpose of ensuring that government officials "make decisions with environmental consequences in mind." (Da vidon Homes, supra, at p. 116; California Farm Bureau Federation v. California Wildlife Conservation Bd. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 186.) "[TJhe agency's exemption determination must be supported by evidence in the record demonstrating that the agency considered possible environmental impacts in reaching its decision." (Davidon Homes, supra, at p. 117; East Peninsula Ed. Council, Inc. v. Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School Dist. (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 155, 171.)
The record before the City, limited as it is because of the lack of analysis performed by CityMark, reveals that the Project's potential effects on the environment make the application of a categorical exemption legally inappropriate. In fact, most of the environmental analysis performed, to date, has been by the church's experts and those analysis have not been challenged, nor apparently analyzed by the City.

A. The City May Not Apply The In-Fill Development Exemption In Light Of The Project's Expected, and Known, Potentially Significant Impacts
The City proposes to avoid CEQA review of the Project by employing the In-Fill Development exemption found at CEQA Guidelines section 15332. This exemption provides that in-fill development may avoid CEQA analysis if:
(a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and
regulations. (b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses. (c) The project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened
species. (d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality. (e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.
Our client has secured all Project materials the City purports to have in its possession or control via the California Public Records Act ("CPRA"). In securing this data, it has become readily obvious that very little analysis of the Project's potentially significant impacts to the environment have been performed to date. In fact, the only data in the administrative record analyzing the Project under CEQA has been provided by our client's environmental experts. These analyses, and the records produced pursuant to the above-mentioned CPRA request, indicate that though CityMark submitted an "Environmental Assessment/Initial Study Application" the City has performed no analysis of its own and has no Initial Study to indicate whether further environmental review must occur. Moreover, the expert analyses provided by our client, concretely and definitively specifies potentially significant impacts in the following CEQA
categories:
(1) Air quality impacts arising from construction. This is especially important in that the Project proposes significant grading - "400 cubic yards of excavation (cut) and 1,400 cubic yards of fill... primarily used to raise the rear of the site to establish a pad for the parking area [along with].... [a] retaining wall of up to eight and a half feet in height is planned along the south end of the parking area" - which is directly adjacent to the area where 125 students currently attend the Warren Walker School, on the church campus. These students are sensitive receptors, spending time outdoors to learn and play, and with open windows, especially during the COVID-19 era, to provide additional ventilation limiting disease spread. (2) Noise impact arising from construction. Again, much like the air impacts category, directly above, but likely to last significantly longer as the construction noise will exist

PWM62

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
March 8, 2021
Page 11 of 13

throughout the site's development both before (during demolition) and long past (during construction) the grading operations. The noise from all of this construction will flow unimpeded into the directly adjacent school and playground disrupting hundreds of children's' education for what is likely to be a period of one to two years. (3) Hazardous materials disposal during construction. The LMWC building was constructed prior to the elimination of asbestos-containing materials, lead-based paints, and polychlorinated biphenyls, yet no analysis has been made of these hazards (or methods to mitigate these potential hazards) upon adjacent residents, churchgoers, senior living facility residents, and/or schoolchildren.
(4) Hydrology and water quality impacts from the developed Project. The church's experts have analyzed the existing site, and the proposed Project at build-out, and determined that the Project's drainage study inaccurately describes the conditions such that considerably more stormwater is expected to flow onto the church property than
reported.
(5) Transportation impacts from construction and the developed Project. These impacts include significant numbers of heavy-haul trucks going through Wilson Street (designated a local collector) interrupting regular traffic and parking along the road, as well as church and school pick-ups and drop-offs, and a failure to follow the current standard in traffic analysis under CEQA, namely a vehicle miles traveled (VMT) analysis pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15064.3. And as indicated above, the analysis indicates the dangers inherent in the intersection at Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street.

But for the Project's hydrology and water quality analyses, the church's expert analyses on the remaining impact categories described above remain the only information in the administrative record such that the City cannot simply overlook the described potentially significant impacts. Neither the Project applicant, nor the City itself, have made any attempt to respond to these expert analyses such that CEQA requires that an initial study be prepared. (Hansen Brothers Enterprises, Inc. V. Board of Supervisors (1996) 12 Cal.4th 533, 560 [standing for the proposition that undisputed evidence in the administrative record must be relied upon.].) Until such time as the Project applicant, or the City, rebut the evidence presented by the church's experts, and with respect to certain issues, the testimony, and opinions of laypersons, those remain the only materials upon which the City may rely in determining whether the exemption to CEQA under Guidelines section 15332 may be effective.
Under CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c), "[a] categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." Such an exception to CEQA Guidelines section 15332 exists in the administrative record in light of church's undisputed expert testimony as to impact categories described above. The City may not ignore evidence of an unusual circumstance a creating a reasonable possibility of a significant environmental impact. (Committee to Save the

Hollywoodland Specific Plan v City of Los Angeles (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1187; McQueen v Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1148; Lewis y Seventeenth District Agricultural Association (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 823, 211.)
In light of these facts, the City cannot use a categorical exemption to avoid further analysis of the Project and must procced to prepare an initial study followed by the preparation of a mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report permitting the public and the City's decisionmakers a thoughtful and reasoned opportunity to examine the totality of the Project and its potential impacts.

III. Conclusion

The City has failed to provide the public with a substantive opportunity to participate in a public forum regarding this Project in light of the inadequate (and with respect to the DAB, non- existent) notice, along with the practical impossibility of petitioning the government with a fulsome expression of the public's intcrests and grievances with regard to the development. The sharply limited deadlines needlessly imposed on the public do not comport with the law.
Further, the Project does not comply with the City's General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, the State Density Bonus Law, nor CEQA. In all, this Project must be sent back for significant further revisions and review.

We further note that the church is now engaged in a quiet title action with the LMWC, before the superior court, over the church's driveway to resolve the ownership, possession, and control of this area. Should the court determine that the church is the title owner of the land, the Project's total size will be sharply reduced resulting in a significant reduction in its base density, as well as any density bonus which may be afforded to it under the current proposal. Moreover, the Project seeks to install a tall retaining wall along this driveway, which will not be permissible upon the church securing explicit title in this land. And, the Project plans show that the church's driveway is being improperly shown as a fire truck access road during times of emergency though it does not offer access to the Project site given the steep slope separating the properties. In light of this, we strongly recommend the City hold back any decision which may result in confusing these issues or bringing the City into the action unnecessarily.

We note the DRB and DAB Staff Reports both inaccurately claim that the Project site at 5220 Wilson Street is owned by CityMark. It is, in fact, owned solely by the LMWC according to the church's latest information.

Re: Appeal of March 8, 2021 Development Advisory Board Determination Regarding Project
No. 2020-16

Dear Ms. Wiegelman:
This correspondence shall serve as a request to appeal the March 8, 2021 City of La Mesa ("City") Development Advisory Board ("DAB") approval of the CityMark Communities LLC (*Applicant") development project, and exemption from the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California, also known as Project No. 2020-16 (the "Project').
Appeal of DAB Determination
Pursuant to La Mesa Municipal Code sections 2.08.051 and 24.02.035, this firm, acting on behalf of its client, St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California ("St. Luke's") located at 5150 Wilson Street, hereby timely appeals the DAB's March 8, 2021 approval of the Project and its exemption from review under CEQA, and attaches a check in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) (a copy of which is presented with the electronic version of the correspondence as Exhibit "A"). As the neighboring property owner representing the interests of its congregation as well as the community at large, St. Luke's files this appeal in light of specific violations of CEQA, the La Mesa Municipal Code, including but not limited to the Project's zoning requirements and concomitant development standards, the California State Density Bonus Law (Government Code § 65915 et seq.), and the City's General Plan as iterated in the letter delivered to the DAB on March 8, 2021 and attached hereto as Exhibit "B."
In addition, certain representations made at the subject DAB hearing indicate that the Project is further violative of the law. We lay several of these issues out below:
1) In expectation of the Project's residents accessing the Grossmont Shopping Center directly across Grossmont Boulevard, the City's staff report to the DAB, at page 2, acknowledges that the "intersection [of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street] is not signalized and is lacking curb

PWM72

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Wiegelman, La Mesa City Clerk
March 16, 2021
Page 2 of 6

ramps and crosswalks." The Applicant's traffic engineer, during the public comment portion of the DAB hearing, indicated that the Project would install a crosswalk across Grossmont Boulevard.
Yet, an examination of the Project plans, as reflected in the staff report, indicates no such street improvements are offered, nor is the City's approval conditioned on the installation of a safe, signalized crosswalk at this intersection • though it is well understood to be a dangerous location in light of the curvature of the street and speed of the automobiles moving through the area. Instead, the staff report, at page 5, provides "[a]s a condition of approval, the applicant will pay a fair-share contribution towards crosswalk improvements to the intersection." Such a mitigation measure is improper in the following respects (beyond those points made in our March 8, 2021 comment letter
to the DAB): a. First, the imposition of this condition of approval shows the DAB, and city staff, recognize the intersection requires a crosswalk in light of the Project's addition of 49 households of new residents, and the additional pedestrian traffic expected from
the Project's three retail spaces, directly accessing the Grossmont Shopping Center
for shopping or parking purposes (the latter especially, in light of the Project's deficient parking space supply). This dangerous condition (i.e., no safe crosswalk, stop signs, or signals) will be heightened by the addition of dozens, if not hundreds, of additional individuals trying to cross Grossmont Boulevard on a daily basis - a clear and unmistakable impact requiring review and mitigation under CEQA. Yet,
the DAB approved an exemption from. CEQA review declaring that there is no
reasonable possibility that a significant impact exists pursuant to CEQA Guidelines
section 15300.2(c). This determination does not comport with the facts, nor the City's determination a that a condition on the Project is required to contribute towards the safety of this intersection. On this basis alone, the DAB's approval of
a categorical exemption is without merit.
b. Second, the DAB's approval of a fair-share contribution, on its face, indicates that
the City expects other neighboring future developments to contribute to the correction of the unsafe conditions at the Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street
intersection due to the foreseeable addition of more pedestrians and vehicles due to residential and commercial development in the arca. This, too, indicates that the cumulative impact exception found at CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(b) ("All [categorical] exemptions.. are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of
successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.")
applies, such that the DAB could not lawfully approve a categorical CEQA
exemption to this Project.
C. Third, the imposition of a mitigation measure, such as a condition requiring a street
improvement, or payment of a fair-share contribution toward such an improvement,
inherently indicates that the Project is expected to result in a significant impact. In
such an instance, no categorical CEQA exemption may be granted. (Salmon
Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098,
1102.) Notwithstanding this, DAB chairman, and Community Development

PWM73

Director, Kerry Kusiak's attempt to waive this legal impropriety by arguing that the
$5,000 contribution to street improvements is a feature of the Project rather than a
condition imposed by the City runs counter to the plain language of the approval • the fair-share contribution is "a condition of approval" (staff report, page 5), and "[t]he applicant shall provide a fee in-lieu of $5,000 [sic] for construction of an ADA compliant curb ramp at the southeast corner of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street" (DAB Resolution No. DAB-2021-xx, at page 4, Engineering
Condition of Approval #21).
Moreover, the argument that this $5,000 contribution is a feature of the Project offered by the Applicant, rather than a mitigation measure imposed by the City, is patently absurd. The Applicant repeatedly indicates, in its own words, when (improperly) seeking waivers under the State Density Bonus Law, that the Project would be financially infeasible due to "cost impacts" if it were to meet the City's development standards (see staff report, Attachment E, pages 2-5)- so, the Council would have to believe that the Applicant is claiming financial difficulty and simultaneously giving away cash to the City even though it was under no obligation to do so (and that there no Project impact to this intersection dictate the imposition of a mitigation measure). Such efforts to avoid CEQA must be avoided as an affront to the community this Council and its staff serve.
As further described in our in March 8, 2021 (Exhibit "B"), this mitigation measure also runs
afoul of the basic tenet of CEQA jurisprudence that payment into a fair-share fee is only permissible if the fees are "part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency commits itself to implementing. (Anderson First Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173, 1187.) There appears to be no such plan, commitment, nor funds to implement, the construction of a crosswalk across Grossmont Boulevard at Wilson Street, nor any indication as to how the $5,000 condition of approval was determined to result in a "fair-share" of the overall expense in light of the Project's impacts - this is, of course, because there has been no lawful
review of the Project's impacts at this intersection in direct violation of CEQA.
The City's Design Review Board, also on March 8, 2021, conditioned the Project's approval on the Applicant's provision of a traffic analysis to prove that the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street was inherently dangerous requiring deviation from the City's standard public realm improvements in the Mixed Use ("MU") zone. This condition indicates that the Applicant specifically seeks a waiver of required development standards due to a hazardous condition to health and safety at this intersection (i.e., by adding numerous new pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles). Whether the waiver is granted, or not, the fact remains that the City acknowledges the Project will generate impacts at this intersection requiring review and mitigation measures such that a categorical CEQA exemption may not be approved in light of
CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c).

PWM74

Ms. Wiegelman, La Mesa City Clerk March 16, 2021

Making matters worse, Mr. Kusiak, also Design Review Board member, declared that the traffic report required of the Project would not be prepared until the Applicant provided "construction drawings" for the development - such construction drawings are submitted when seeking building permits, well after the Project's discretionary entitlements have been considered and issued by the City. This, too, runs afoul of CEQA in that mitigation measures, and analyses, studies, and reports required to develop such measures in light of expected environmental impacts may not be deferred. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4(a)(1)(B).)
2) Throughout the DAB hearing, Mr. Kusiak incorrectly declared that the Project was a "by- right" development. A "by-right" development means the Project cannot be reviewed in discretionary manner but must instead by approved ministerially. This is incorrect and runs afoul of CEQA in that it provides an inaccurate description of the Project likely to mislead the public, and other decisionmakers, as to their rights and the scope of analysis owed the Project under the law.

The California Supreme Court recently opined on this very issue clarifying the difference between discretionary and ministerial projects:
A permit issuance decision can be discretionary or ministerial depending on the circumstances. Those terms are defined in the CEQA Guidelines. A project is discretionary when an agency is required to exercise judgment or deliberation in deciding whether to approve an activity. (CEQA Guidelines, 15357.) It is distinguished from a ministerial project, for which the agency merely determines whether applicable statutes, ordinances, regulations, or other fixed standards have been satisfied. (lbid.) Ministerial projects are those for which "the law requires [an] agency to act ... in a set way without allowing the agency to use its own judgment...." (CEQA Guidelines, 40 15002, subd. (i)(1).) They involve "little or no personal judgment by the public official as to the wisdom or manner of carrying out the project. The public official merely applies the law to the facts as presented but uses no special discretion or judgment in reaching a decision." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15369.)
[Protecting Our Water & Environmental Resources V. County of Stanislaus (2020) 10 Cal. 5th 479, 489.]
On its face, the Project requires the approval of a Site Development Plan in light of its MU zoning. (DAB staff report, page 2 ["Entitlement review for new development in the MU zone involves site development plan review by the Development Advisory Board and design review by the Design Review Board, subject to City Council ratification."] The La Mesa Municipal Code, at section 24.02.034, further indicates that the review of a Site Development Plan is a discretionary process subject to approval, approval with conditions or denial, upon determining the project findings to be satisfactory and the City's design objectives are met, to ensure "that no detriment to

PWM75

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Wiegelman, La Mesa City Clerk March 16, 2021
Page 5 of 6

the public health, safety a of welfare will result." Such a review specifically calls out the City's responsibility to use its judgment in deliberating whether to approve the Project's Site
Development Plan.
Moreover, Mr. Kusiak's declaration that the Project is "by-right" does not comport with CEQA. CEQA specifically does not apply to ministerial projects. (Public Resources Code cop 21080(b).) The very fact that the DAB sought to approve an exemption from CEQA pursuant to Guideline section 15332 indicates that the Project is discretionary in that a CEQA exemption is
not applicable to ministerial projects.
CEQA is intended to provide the public, and decisionmakers, with accurate information about the nature and full scope of a development. (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal. App. 3d 185, 192.) Providing inaccurate information, misleading the public, and other decisionmakers, as to their rights to review and analyze the Project is a disservice to the community and discourages thoughtful discussion necessary to shape a discretionary development review. (Id. [an "accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an informative and legally sufficient" review under CEQA.].) The inaccurate description of the Project must be corrected to
comply with CEQA.
Similarly, Mr. Kusiak stated that the DAB had no authority to deny the Project's requested waiver under the State Density Bonus Law due to health and safety concerns (raised, largely, with respect to the dangerous traffic-related conditions at the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street). This, too, is an incorrect statement of the law and the scope of the City's authority to review the Project under CEQA. As indicated in our March 8, 2021 letter to the DAB, Government Code section 65915(e)(1) specifically provides that waivers of development standards under the State Density Bonus Law should not be granted when they would result in "specific, adverse impact... upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact." Though the DAB (and the DRB), as well as the City staff report, acknowledge that the Project's waivers result in specific, adverse impacts upon health, safety, and the physical environment without offer of satisfactory mitigation, due to the claimed exemption from CEQA, with respect to public realm
improvements (resulting in hazardous traffic conditions), parking space size and drive aisle standards (resulting in hazardous traffic and parking conditions), open space standards, landscaping standards, and other deviations from development standards, these waivers were approved due to an inaccurate statement of the law - claiming that the DAB could not deny the waivers under circumstances where specific, adverse impacts to health and safety are expressly acknowledged to exist. In light of this, the Project's waivers must be reconsidered and its impacts on the environment reviewed to determine what mitigation measures may be imposed.
Further, in light of the rampant inaccuracies, misstatements of law, and impropriety of appointing City staff (i.e., the Community Development Director, City Engineer, Building Division Director, and Fire Marshal) to review staff recommendations, and afford discretionary

PWM76

approval of projects, we strongly recommend the City reconsider its current practices. It does not appear that the composition of the DAB, nor the Design Review Board, afford any semblance of an impartial determination on matters of great importance to the public. Rather, these bodies appear to act as "rubber-stamps" on staff decisions. At the very least, the Council should consider having a municipal attorney staff each such meeting to protect the City's interests, and those of the community.

Sincerely,
Inh

Re: Project No. 2020-16 (CityMark Communities LLC) - 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, CA

Dear Ms. Kinnard:

This law firm represents the St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California located at 5150 Wilson Street, directly adjacent to the La Mesa Woman's Club ("LMWC"), the site of a 49 residential unit and three commercial unit mixed-use project ("Project") proposed by CityMark Communities LLC ("CityMark") known as Project No. 2020-16. This correspondence is offered to inform the City of La Mesa ("City") of our client's grave concerns regarding the proposed Project, the limited conditions recommended to ensure the health and safety of the public, and the apparent lack of analysis of the Project's expected impacts.
We also wish to bring to the City's attention that on December 17, 2020 this firm requested to be placed on the notice list for all public hearings relating to the Project, and specifically those relating to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Notwithstanding this, we were only sent notice of the March 8, 2021, 12:30 p.m. Design Review Board ("DRB") meeting after regular work hours, at 8:10 p.m., on Thursday, March 4, 2021 (see Attachment "1"), indicating that the City requires audio/visual presentations by the public to be submitted by "12:00 noon, one business day prior to the start of the meeting." It would be practically impossible to prepare and transmit any presentation, let alone a thoughtful one, within three regular working hours of receipt of said notice (i.e., after 9 a.m. on March 5, 2021) to comply with the City's stated deadline. What is more, no notice was sent to this office of the March 8, 2021, 10 a.m. Development Advisory Board ("DAB") meeting though we understand that an exemption to CEQA analysis is to be voted on in this hearing. In fact, it is solely due to our client's diligence in searching the City's website, at approximately 11:15 am on March 5, 2021, that we learned of the DAB meeting at all again, making it impossible to provide the City with an audio/visual presentation by the 12:00 noon deadline set for that same day.
We understand that COVID-19 has altered the conditions by which we all live and work, and that the City is permitted to avoid direct communications from the public during such hearings

PWM81

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV

in light of California Executive Order N-29-20. Yet, the failure to afford the public a practical opportunity to review, analyze, and respond to the Project's 137-page DRB staff report and the 150-page DAB staff report does not comport with the public's statutory and constitutional rights to petition its government under the Ralph M. Brown Act. (Government Code 54950 et seq.; Cal. Const., Art. I § 3, subd. (a) and (b)(1), (7).) These actions run afoul of the law as they present limitations on public participation which are simply "too arbitrary and capricious, too restrictive and unreasonable." (Nevens V. Chino (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 775, 778; see also Robins v. Pruneyard Shopping Center (1979) 23 Cal.3d 899, 907 [The right of the people to petition the government for redress of grievances is "vital to a basic process in the state's constitutional scheme."].)
Furthermore, should CityMark, or its consultants, be permitted to present audio/visual materials to, or communicate directly with, the DAB or DRB boards during these hearings on March 8, 2021 it will only heighten the inequities inherent in providing late, or no, notice to the public, with regard to the respective rights of the parties to petition their government. This would be an unfortunate, and likely unlawful, action in unequal treatment under both state and federal statutes and constitutions. A more reasoned action would be to postpone each of the DAB and
DRB hearings by week, or more, to permit each party, and the public more generally, an opportunity to present their positions thoughtfully.
Notwithstanding this, we offer a limited summary of our client's position with respect to the proposed Project in the hopes that it will be presented to the DAB and DRB board members for review prior to any discussion of, or determination on, this matter. In light of the severely constrained time available to us before the DAB and DRB meetings, we will not reiterate each of
the points made in prior communications and correspondence delivered to the City in opposition to the Project but join in those comments by this reference. Rather, we will focus briefly on the inadequate analysis of the Project in light of the City's General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, the Project's inapt use of California State Density Bonus Law (Gov. Code § 65915 et seq.) waivers, and the impropriety of the claimed CEQA exemption under Guidelines section 15332.

I. The Project Runs Afoul Of The General Plan's Urban Design Element And The Zoning Ordinance
As the staff reports to each of the DAB and DRB indicate, the Project site is designated as "Mixed Use Urban," corresponding to the Mixed Use (MU) Overlay, in the Residential Business base zone and is intended to support "pedestrian friendly housing." (DAB Staff Report, p. 2; DRB Staff Report, p.2.) Notwithstanding this, the Project seeks to avoid the very features it is obligated to provide to enable pedestrian-friendly housing.

The Project sits under 100 feet away, directly across Grossmont Boulevard, from the Grossmont Shopping Center. The closest supermarket to the Project is the Walmart Neighborhood Market therein, lying approximately 350 feet away, yet because there is no crosswalk, stop sign, and/or traffic signal at the intersection of Wilson Street and Grossmont Boulevard, a resident of the Project would be required to walk about three-quarters of a mile to safely cross the street, pick up groceries, and return with them - it is doubtful many residents will be able to lug an average family's weekly groceries this distance, on foot. (DAB Staff Report, p. 2 [In fact, the City recognizes this failing at the beginning of its report, "The intersection is not signalized and is lacking curb ramps and crosswalks."]; see also DRB Staff Report at p. 2 for the same
acknowledgment of a dangerous condition].) Notwithstanding this, it appears the Project is being permitted to avoid the development of a crosswalk which is absolutely necessary for its residents or, at least, providing an analysis showing the Project will generate significantly more average daily vehicular trips and vehicle miles traveled than contemplated.
The City failed to require a traffic analysis for the Project, though it initially sought to require an ADA-compliant ramp be constructed at this intersection before apparently dropping this condition altogether. Our client's environmental consultant has also indicated this intersection is particularly dangerous because of limited sightlines arising from a substantial curve in Grossmont Boulevard in this area. The observation that this particular intersection is dangerous has been voiced numerous times in correspondence submitted to the City by multiple parties. Yet the staff reports show that no ramp, crosswalk, or analysis was required of the Project - instead, the Project is conditioned to provide : $5,000 "fair-share" payment toward a ramp to be built by an unknown party at an unknown time in the future. This does not comport with the law.
There appears to be no plan on file to develop a safe intersection at Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street, and the $5,000 payment does not appear to go towards any previously approved fund for that purpose. Nor is there any indication of how this figure was calculated. In Anderson First Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173, the appellate court held that paying a "fair-share fee" is permissible as effective mitigation only if the fees are "part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency commits itself to implementing." That is not the case in this instance. In light of this, the City must require the installation of an appropriately signalized intersection, or some other traffic calming feature here, or require the Project to present an analysis indicating why it should not do so. The only evidence in the administrative record, to date, on this topic shows that the City initially desired a crosswalk to be installed but backed off without explanation (or analysis available to the public, or the City's decisionmakers).
"Tn MU areas, new development is required to include pedestrian realm improvements along collector streets to encourage pedestrian activity. The Circulation Element classifies Grossmont Boulevard as major collector street subject to pedestrian realm requirements." (DAB Staff Report, p. 2; DRB Staff Report, p. 2. [Emphasis added.]; see also La Mesa Municipal Code

§ 24.18.040(B).) The condition to pay a fee in licu of an actual mitigation measure regarding a known project impact runs afoul of CEQA and should not be permitted. Rather the Project must be required to perform an analysis to determine the scope of the impact and to then propose a mitigation measure to reduce that impact to a less than significant level.
Moreover, this mitigation measure is improper on two other bases. First, it improperly attempts to defer mitigation until a later (and, in this case, unknown future) time. This is specifically forbidden under CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4 (a)(1)(B).) And second, a mitigation measure is only available if a project under CEQA is expected to generate a potentially significant impact on the environment, but the staff report indicates that the Project is exempt from CEQA because there are no such expected impacts. (DAB Staff Report, p. 7-8; see also DAB Staff Report, Attachment A, "Resolution No. DAB-2021-xx" at Par. 1.) So, either the Project is not exempt from CEQA and cannot be conditioned to mitigate a potentially significant impact, or it must be analyzed properly under CEQA (i.e., by preparation of an Initial Study, followed by specific impact category studies, and the development of a mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report). The status quo does not comport with the law. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102 [a public agency may not adopt mitigation measures for a project for the purpose of qualifying it for a categorical CEQA exemption; see also Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1200.)
A. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Limited To Overcoming Physical, Not Financial, Constraints Such That Avoiding Improvements To The Pedestrian Realm Are Not Permitted For This Project
As indicated above, the Project is designated Mixed Use Urban requiring improvements to the surrounding pedestrian realm. LMMC § 24.18.020(E) defines the term "pedestrian realm" as
follows:

"Pedestrian realm" means a twelve-foot wide area located between the face of the curb of a Circulation Element designated street and the face of the building. The pedestrian realm includes the parkway, sidewalk, and landscaped areas. The pedestrian realm may include both public and private property where the public right-of-way is not twelve feet wide. Pedestrian amenities, street trees, street furniture, bus stop facilities, and other landscaping, as specified in this chapter, shall be included in the public realm.
Notwithstanding this acknowledged requirement, "[w]aivers are being requested to allow reductions in... pedestrian realm requirements." (DAB Staff Report, p. 3; DRB Staff Report, p. 3.) For instance, the Project seeks a "waiver" under the State Density Bonus Law so that it may encroach four feet into the pedestrian realm along Grossmont Boulevard by installing balconies hanging over this right of way. This miscomprehends what a waiver is under the law.

Pursuant to Government Code §65915(e)(1), waivers (as opposed to incentives) are afforded to density bonus project only when a "development standard will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development," not because the developer desires it, or because it will enhance the financial prospects of a project. Put another way, a waiver permits a deviation from, or altogether evasion of, regulations which affect a project due to its site-specific physical features. This subject site has no such physical constraints. Rather, the balconies could be built outside of the pedestrian realm (i.e., within the building envelope) by moving the exterior walls along Grossmont Boulevard back four feet, or removed altogether. The applicant itself makes clear that it is a not a physical constraint that drives this waiver request when it states its justification as follows:
This waiver is requested due to excessive space and cost impacts to incorporate the Open Space requirement and private balconies. The loss of development potential to incorporate this would make the project infeasible to provide the affordable units.
As mentioned above, the site itself does not have any physical obstruction which precludes construction of these balconies, rather CityMark simply desires to have them overhang the pedestrian realm because it would increase their financial incentive to develop the Project. The State Density Bonus Law permits this sort of deviation from regulation for financial gain through the use of incentives, of which the Project has two (waivers, on the other hand, are unlimited for such developments). Yet, the Project avoids using any of its incentives and instead improperly requests at least five waivers to avoid its open space requirements, building height limit, parking space sizing, landscaping required within the pedestrian realm, and overall parking requirements. In each such instance, CityMark indicates that the justification for the waiver is not a physical constraint unique to the site but rather the request is made to seek a financial boon for the
developer.

The reason the Project secks to use waivers rather than incentives is clear on its face - the
State Density Bonus Law does not authorize a sufficient number of incentives (i.e., the Project requires five, but only has two available to it) to mcet CityMark's desired financial goals, whereas it may request an unlimited number of waivers. Because it does not have sufficient incentives to develop the Project in this manner, it attempts to avoid their use altogether and instead make faulty justifications for waivers which are impermissible under the law.
a Because CityMark cannot show a physical constraint exists which limits the development of the Project under the City's laws and policies, it must use its incentives (and justify the use of those incentives by showing the financial benefit gained thereby) and/or redesign the Project to be in conformity with the law.

B. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Not Permitted To Overcome Regulations That
Pertain To Health And Safety
As mentioned above, the Project's requests for waivers are inapposite to the law because they pertain to financial rather than physical constraints. In addition, the Project
improperly seeks to waive the City's standard parking space and driving aisle dimensions even though this would result in direct health and safety impacts. Waivers are impermissible on this
basis as well.

The dimensions of parking spaces and adjacent driving aisles arc specified to ensure the safety of vehicles, their drivers and passengers, and pedestrians. (LMMC § 22.112.010(B).) This makes common sense - if spaces and driving aisles are too small, or otherwise constrained, they are likelier to lead to physical harm from other vehicles when vacating or entering a space and are the reason why State building codes requires minimum parking dimensions to ensure health and safety. (DAB Staff Report, p. 3 & Attachment D, pp. 3-4; DRB Staff Report, p. 3 & Attachment E, pp. 3-4.)
Government Code section 65915(e)(1) of the State Density Bonus Law provides:
Nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted to require a local government to
waive or reduce development standards if the waiver or reduction would have a specific, adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5, upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact.
[Emphasis added.]
Thus, a waiver cannot be used to avoid the specific, adverse impact arising from the reduction of a basic safety feature inherent in parking stall/space sizes and driving aisle dimensions as contemplated by the Project due to the health and safety issues it raises. No justification exists which would be sufficient to overcome this requested reduction in health and safety standards, nor would an incentive permit such thing.
C. The Project, As Designed, Is Contrary To The ChiefLand Use Policies Declared Under The Land Use And Urban Design Element Of The General Plan
California law requires each city and county to adopt a general plan, a comprehensive long- term plan for the development of that city or county, famously referred to by the state Supreme Court as the "constitution for future development." (Lesher Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 540.) A general plan must contain seven mandatory "elements," including a "land use element" to designate the level of intensity and general distribution of land uses. (Gov. Code § 65302.) "[T]he propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development depends upon [a finding of] consistency with the applicable general plan and its

PWM86

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
March 8, 2021
Page 7 of 13

elements." (Resource Defense Fund v. County of Santa Cruz (1982) 133 Cal.App.3rd 800, 806.) CEQA imposes an obligation on La Mesa to assess the Project's consistency with the City's General Plan. (North Coast Rivers Alliance et al. v. Marin Municipal Water District (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 614, 633.) The Project, as designed and proposed, cannot be found to be consistent with the Land Use and Urban Design Element of the City's General Plan.

By way of example:

1) Policy LU-1.2.2 requires that "[a]s part of the development review process, City departments will review all future development to ensure that safety requirements are met, including building and fire codes, accessibility standards and crime prevention techniques. Yet, as indicated above, the City's failure to ensure that the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street indicates that no such review has been performed (or that, if it has, the requirement to ensure safety has been obviated) such that a dangerous condition not only is permitted to exist, but it is being worsened by increasing the vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the area while also attempting to authorize a large development where a single-story structure currently exists, further reducing sight lines on a dangerous curve in the road. Similarly, the proposed waivers to reduce parking space dimensions and drive aisle widths do not "ensure that safety requirements are met, including building and fire codes, [nor] accessibility standards." 2) Policy LU-2.1.2 requires the City to "[s]upport infill development and subdivision proposals that reinforce neighborhood strengths and benefit neighborhood identity," yet the Project proposes a development which is so different in character and intensity from any other in the neighborhood, both with respect to its architectural style and the materials used on its exterior walls - none of which can be found elsewhere in this community. Thus, it cannot be said that this Project will "reinforce" the existing visual appeal of the community.
3) Policy LU-2.1.5 requires the implementation of projects in the "Mixed-Use Overlay Zone by promoting the rehabilitation of properties and new development that fits into the context of the existing neighborhoods while meeting the City's Urban Design Objectives for infill development." Again, as noted directly above, in #2, the Project is completely out of character and context with respect to the existing neighborhood such that this policy cannot be met.
4) Policy LU-4.2.3 requires that "[n]ew devclopment shall provide adequate parking.' As the Project specifically seeks to not only reduce parking space numbers below the City's normal standards, it also seeks to reduce the number below those permitted under the State Density Bonus Law (albeit, improperly attempting to do so via a waiver, as indicated in the immediately preceding two sections of this letter). Also, as indicated in the immediately preceding section, the Project does not provide adequate parking not only with respect to the reduced number of spaces it proposes, but also improperly attempts to reduce the dimensions of the spaces and the drive aisles around them in a manner likely to impact the public's (and future residents') health and safety. Thus, the Project clearly conflicts with this policy as well. 5) Objective UD-1.1 requires the City's "It]o protect La Mesa's existing built environment and cultural heritage." But the Project proposes to destroy the LMWC clubhouse

PWM87

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
March 8, 2021
Page 8 of 13

which has been in place for over half a century and, thus, conflicts directly and inarguably with this policy.
6) Objective UD-3.1 requires that development be "architecturally and environmentally sensitive and ...compatible with neighboring design and scale." As indicated in the discussions regarding Policy LU-1.2.2 and Policy LU-2.1.2 directly above, the Project is unlike anything in this neighborhood, cspecially with respect to its design and scale, and therefore, conflicts with this objective of the General Plan.
In short, the Project cannot be said to be in harmony with the City's General Plan Land Use and Urban Design Element as proposed. As such, it must be revised significantly to come into conformance with the General Plan, and the surrounding community.

II. The Project Fails To Comply With The California Environmental Quality Act
The primary purposes of CEQA are to inform City decisionmakers, as well as the public, about the potential impacts of a project, and to prescribe mitigation measures to avoid such impacts. CEQA requires a broad view of what constitutes a project requiring environmental analysis. (McQueen v. Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1143.) Even projects that appear benign will likely fall within the ambit of CEQA. (Bloom v. McGurk (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1307, 1312.) The California State Legislature formulated CEQA to "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of the environment shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions." (Pub. Res. Code §21001(d).) To implement this goal, CEQA requires municipalities to analyze discretionary projects for potential environmental impacts utilizing a three-tier system. (No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 74.) The first tier is known as a preliminary review. The preliminary review requires public agency staff to analyze a complete application in order to discern the full scope of the project at issue. (CEQA Guidelines section 15060(b); City of Pasadena v. The State of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 810, 836.) Once the parameters of the project are established, a determination is made to resolve whether an exemption is applicable to the project. If such an exemption is found, the agency must determine that no exceptions to the exemption are triggered by the potential impacts from the full scope of the project. (CEQA Guidelines §§ 15060, 15061.) If the project is not exempt from CEQA, or an exception is applicable, the second tier of review is required wherein an initial study is prepared because it has
been determined that there is a possibility that the project may have a significant effect on the environment. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063.) An initial study facilitates environmental assessment carly in the design of a project. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063(c).) In the third tier, the initial study is used to demonstrate that either: a) the project "will not have a significant effect," triggering the preparation of a negative declaration, or b) the project is one "which may have a significant effect on the environment," triggering the preparation of an environmental impact report ("EIR"). (CEQA Guidelines § 15064.)

PWM88

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard

Page 9 of 13

While the Guidelines provide opportunities for projects to be exempted from CEQA review, these exemptions are limited in nature. "Only those projects having no significant effect on the environment are categorically exempt from CEQA review." (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network, supra, at p. 1102.) A significant effect is a "substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in the environment." (Pub. Res. Code §21068. [Emphasis added.]) This a means that an activity has a significant effect if, among other things, it "has the potential to degrade the quality of the environment." (Pub. Res. Code § 21083.) "[A]n activity that may have a significant effect on the environment cannot be categorically exempt.' (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 124. [Emphasis added.])
The courts review categorical exemptions using strict construction a in a manner affording the greatest environmental protection within the reasonable scope of the statutory language. (County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 966.) "[E]xemption categories are not to be expanded or broadened beyond the reasonable scope of their statutory language." (Dehne v. County of Santa Clara (1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 827, 842.) Thus, an exemption must be applicable in light of the full scope of a project.
A public agency has the burden of proving that substantial evidence supports its factual finding that project falls within the asserted exemption. (Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose, 54 Cal. App. 4th 106, 114-115 (1997); Magan v. County of Kings (2002) 105 Cal.App.4th 468, 475.) "An agency's duty to provide such factual support 'is all the more important where the record shows ...that opponents of the project have raised arguments regarding possible significant environmental impacts." (Muzzy Ranch Co. v. Solano County Airport Land Use Com. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 372, 386.) A city cannot impose a burden on the public to prove a possibility of adverse environmental impacts since this would frustrate CEQA's fundamental purpose of ensuring that government officials "make decisions with environmental consequences in mind." (Davidon Homes, supra, at p. 116; California Farm Bureau Federation v. California Wildlife Conservation Bd. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 186.) "[T]he agency's exemption determination must be supported by evidence in the record demonstrating that the agency considered possible environmental impacts in reaching its decision." (Davidon Homes, supra, at p. 117; East Peninsula Ed. Council, Inc. v. Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School Dist. (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 155, 171.)
The record before the City, limited as it is because of the lack of analysis performed by CityMark, reveals that the Project's potential effects on the environment make the application of a categorical exemption legally inappropriate. In fact, most of the environmental analysis performed, to date, has been by the church's experts and those analysis have not been challenged, nor apparently analyzed by the City.

A. The City May Not Apply The In-Fill Development Exemption In Light Of The Project's Expected, and Known, Potentially Significant Impacts
The City proposes to avoid CEQA review of the Project by employing the In-Fill Development exemption found at CEQA Guidelines section 15332. This exemption provides that in-fill development may avoid CEQA analysis if:
(a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and
regulations. (b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses. (c) The project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened
species. (d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality. (e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.
Our client has secured all Project materials the City purports to have in its possession or control via the California Public Records Act ("CPRA"). In securing this data, it has become readily obvious that very little analysis of the Project's potentially significant impacts to the environment have been performed to date. In fact, the only data in the administrative record analyzing the Project under CEQA has been provided by our client's environmental experts. These analyses, and the records produced pursuant to the above-mentioned CPRA request, indicate that though CityMark submitted an "Environmental Assessment/Initial Study Application" the City has performed no analysis of its own and has no Initial Study to indicate whether further environmental review must occur. Moreover, the expert analyses provided by our client, concretely and definitively specifies potentially significant impacts in the following CEQA categories:
(1) Air quality impacts arising from construction. This is especially important in that the Project proposes significant grading - "400 cubic yards of excavation (cut) and 1,400 cubic yards of fill... primarily used to raise the rear of the site to establish a pad for the parking area [along with].... [a] retaining wall of up to eight and a half feet in height is planned along the south end of the parking area" -- which is directly adjacent to the area where 125 students currently attend the Warren Walker School, on the church campus. These students are sensitive receptors, spending time outdoors to learn and play, and with open windows, especially during the COVID-19 era, to provide additional ventilation limiting disease spread. (2) Noise impact arising from construction, Again, much like the air impacts category, directly above, but likely to last significantly longer as the construction noise will exist

PWM90

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
March 8. 2021
Page 11 of 13

throughout the site's development both before (during demolition) and long past (during construction) the grading operations. The noise from all of this construction will flow unimpeded into the directly adjacent school and playground disrupting hundreds of children's' education for what is likely to be a period of one to two years. (3) Hazardous materials disposal during construction. The LMWC building was constructed prior to the elimination of asbestos-containing materials, lead-based paints, and polychlorinated biphenyls, yet no analysis has been made of these hazards (or methods to mitigate these potential hazards) upon adjacent residents, churchgoers, senior living facility residents, and/or schoolchildren. (4) Hydrology and water quality impacts from the developed Project. The church's experts have analyzed the existing site, and the proposed Project at build-out, and determined that the Project's drainage study inaccurately describes the conditions such that considerably more stormwater is expected to flow onto the church property than reported.
(5) Transportation impacts from construction and the developed Project. These impacts include significant numbers of heavy-haul trucks going through Wilson Street (designated a local collector) interrupting regular traffic and parking along the road, as well as church and school pick-ups and drop-offs, and a failure to follow the current standard in traffic analysis under CEQA, namely a vehicle miles traveled (VMT) analysis pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15064.3. And as indicated above, the analysis indicates the dangers inherent in the intersection at Grossmont Boulevard and
Wilson Street.

But for the Project's hydrology and water quality analyses, the church's expert analyses on the remaining impact categories described above remain the only information in the administrative record such that the City cannot simply overlook the described potentially significant impacts. Neither the Project applicant, nor the City itself, have made any attempt to respond to these expert analyses such that CEQA requires that an initial study be prepared. (Hansen Brothers Enterprises, Inc. V. Board of Supervisors (1996) 12 Cal.4th 533, 560 [standing for the proposition that undisputed evidence in the administrative record must be relied upon.].) Until such time as the Project applicant, or the City, rebut the evidence presented by the church's experts, and with respect to certain issues, the testimony, and opinions of laypersons, those remain the only materials upon which the City may rely in determining whether the exemption to CEQA under Guidelines section 15332 may be effective.
Under CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c), "[a] categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." Such an exception to CEQA Guidelines section 15332 exists in the administrative record in light of church's undisputed expert testimony as to impact categories described above. The City may not ignore evidence of an unusual circumstance creating a reasonable possibility of a significant environmental impact. (Committee to Sa ve the

Hollywoodland Specific Plan v City of Los Angeles (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1187; McQueen v Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1148; Lewis v Seventeenth District Agricultural Association (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 823, 211.)
In light of these facts, the City cannot use a categorical exemption to avoid further analysis of the Project and must proceed to prepare an initial study followed by the preparation of a mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report permitting the public and the City's decisionmakers a thoughtful and reasoned opportunity to examine the totality of the Project and its potential impacts.

III. Conclusion

The City has failed to provide the public with a substantive opportunity to participate in a public forum regarding this Project in light of the inadequate (and with respect to the DAB, non- existent) notice, along with the practical impossibility of petitioning the government with a fulsome expression of the public's interests and grievances with regard to the development. The sharply limited deadlines needlessly imposed on the public do not comport with the law.
Further, the Project does not comply with the City's General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, the State Density Bonus Law, nor CEQA. In all, this Project must be sent back for significant further revisions and review.
We further note that the church is now engaged in a quiet a title action with the LMWC, before the superior court, over the church's driveway to resolve the ownership, possession, and control of this area. Should the court determine that the church is the title owner of the land, the Project's total size will be sharply reduced resulting a in a significant reduction in its base density, as well as any density bonus which may be afforded to it under the current proposal. Moreover, the Project seeks to install a tall retaining wall along this driveway, which will not be permissible upon the church securing explicit title in this land. And, the Project plans show that the church's driveway is being improperly shown as a fire truck access road during times of emergency though it does not offer access to the Project site given the steep slope separating the properties. In light of this, we strongly recommend the City hold back any decision which may result in confusing these issues or bringing the City into the action unnecessarily.

We note the DRB and DAB Staff Reports both inaccurately claim that the Project site at 5220 Wilson Street is owned by CityMark. It is, in fact, owned solely by the LMWC according to the church's latest information.

Re: Appeal of Development Advisory Board Determination (Project No. 2020-16, 5220 Wilson
Street, La Mesa, CA)

Dear Ms. Kinnard:
As you know, this firm filed a timely a appeal of the now-defunct Development Advisory Board's (DAB") March 8, 2021 approval of Project No. 2020-16 and grant of California environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") exemption (collectively, the "Project") on behalf of St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California ("Church"). That appeal is the subject of the July 21, 2021 hearing before the City of La Mesa ("City") Planning Commission ("Commission"). This correspondence shall serve to further explain the procedural and substantive shortcomings inherent in the DAB's actions and the Project itself, and why the Commission must, by law, approve our
client's appeal.
The Approval Of The Project Is Void On Its Face and Must Be Rescinded Due To The Development Advisory Board's Procedural Deficiencies Resulting In Its Dissolution
The Project seeks a Site Development Permit ("SDP") and an exemption from CEQA to demolish the La Mesa Woman's Club facilities (the "Clubhouse") at 5220 Wilson Street and construct a nearly 50 foot tall mixed use development consisting of 49 residential apartments and 3 retail spaces. To attain this intensity of use, the Project employs the State Density Bonus Law ("SDBL"; Gov. Code § 65915 et seq.) to deviate from the standard development requirements of the La Mesa Municipal Code ("LMMC"). Yet, the City is not permitted to deviate from the procedural requirements set forth in the Ralph M. Brown Act (the "Brown Act"), CEQA, and the LMMC, to grant approval for the Project. Below is a brief explanation, highlighting some of the unlawful actions taken by the City through the DAB, ultimately resulting in the body's dissolution specifically due to its approval of the Project.
Though the Church abuts the Clubhouse, and this firm specifically requested notice of all public hearings relating to the Project, the City failed to afford legal notice in violation of the

PWM126

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
July 14, 2021
Page 2 of 7

Brown Act and CEQA. (Gov. Code § 54954.1; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 ["CEQA Guidelines"] 15087(a)(3).) Though no technical, or other physical, limitation existed, the DAB unlawfully prohibited the public's right to participate in the hearing waiving any right to public oral comments yet, the DAB authorized the applicant to make an extended audio and visual presentation and held over an hour's worth of back-and-forth communications with the applicant and its consultants in assessing the Project. Upon conclusion, the DAB granted approval of the requested SDP and CEQA exemption. This is further detailed in our March 16, 2021 letter of appeal (the "Appeal"), attached hereto as Exhibit "1." The substantive and procedural points shortcomings of the Project described therein are incorporated in full.
Thereafter, on April 7, 2021, this firm delivered to the City a Demand for Cure and Correction (the *Demand") pursuant to the Brown Act to request the unwinding of the DAB's unlawful actions - a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit "2." The procedural shortcomings of the Project described therein are incorporated in full.
In short, the Demand alleges, amongst other things, that the DAB itself was improperly composed in that its members are senior City staff who serially, or directly, communicated about the Project (and other development proposals), informing one another as to their intent to grant approval, and the conditions of such approval, outside of open, public meetings in violation of basic tenets of open government. (See, e.g., Gov. Code § 54952.2(b) [*A majority of the members of a legislative body shall not, outside a meeting authorized by this chapter, use a series of communications of any kind, directly or through intermediaries, to discuss, deliberate, or take action on any item of business that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the legislative body."].)
City Attorney Glenn Sabine, in conference with Community Development Director Kerry Kusiak, and City Manager Greg Humora, acknowledged that Brown Act violations likely existed, just as the Church claimed. (Sce Exhibit $33 communications between Mr. Sabine and the
undersigned acknowledging the DAB's Brown Act violations.) Notwithstanding Messrs. Sabine, Kusiak, and Humora stated intention to request the DAB be terminated, the City Council failed to cure the alleged violations within the statutory thirty (30) day period afforded for such actions, nor offered "an unconditional commitment to cease, desist from, and not repeat the past action" as is required by law to avoid such litigation. (Gov. Code §§ 54960.1(c), 54960.2(a)(4).)
On or about May 24, 2021, the Church filed litigation with the San Diego Superior Court detailing the DAB's violations under the Brown Act and the LMMC. Attached as Exhibit "4" is the subject Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint filed with the Court. Thereafter, the City Council dissolved the DAB - though it again, failing to offer any indication that it had made an unconditional commitment as to the other allegations made within the Demand. (Exhibit '533

PWM127

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
July 14, 2021
Page 3 of 7

City Ordinance approved on or about June 8, 2021 dissolving the DA ) Notwithstanding this, the City Council has yet to offer an acknowledgment of the alleged Brown Act violations detailed in the Demand, nor taken steps to unwind the violative actions taken by the DAB. (Gov. Code § 54960.2(a)(4).)
Nor has the City followed through in rehearing the Project under its new SDP revicw process, as indicated would be done (See Exhibit "3" at p. DA 2, wherein Mr. Sabine wrote to the undersigned, "..City staff would be happy to "redo" the March 8, 2021 DAB hearing
on the development project planned at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California.") Instead, the City has moved the Project "forward" in presenting the matter to the Planning Commission in direct contradiction to any cognizable notion that the City had cured the Brown Act violations it acknowledged existed with respect to the DAB.
Now, the Commission is faced with the unenviable task of reviewing an invalid, and unsupportable, determination by a defunct body. Rather than following the basic mandates of the law, and taking proactive steps to correct these violations, the City appears ready to compound its unlawful actions and lay the problem at the Commission's feet. The Church strongly recommends the Commission reject the review of this Project out of hand, uphold the appeal, and demand the City staff conform with its own municipal code requirements, the Brown Act, and CEQA. A rescission of the DAB's approval of the Project, including its CEQA exemption, is required under the law, and will only serve to save the City, and thereby its taxpayers, the unnecessary expense of having the Court order this very thing.
The Project, As Posed, Is In Violation Of The California Environmental Quality Act And Does Not Comply With The California State Density Bonus Law Requiring This Appeal Be
Upheld

As described above, the Project seeks to use the SDBL to demolish the Clubhouse and construct a mixed-use development in its place. In doing so, the Project must comply not only with the SDBL, but with CEQA, the LMMC, and the City's General Plan, Zoning Ordinance and all applicable zoning overlays. In all of these regards, the Project fails.
The subject site is zoned Residential Business and located within the Mixed Use (MU) Overlay. Though mixed use developments are to be expected on such sites, this zoning requires the Project to provide pedestrian friendly housing. (LMMC § 24.18.010(B)(4).) The SDBL does not authorize waivers from such requirements unless a physical constraint exists within the site which would not permit such development. And though there is no such physical constraint, the Project was approved by the DAB to avoid making the improvements which would be required of

1 The Church has not determined whether the actions taken by the City in dissolving the DAB, or in revising the methodology by which an SDP, and this Project, must now be reviewed, comport with the law. Therefore, the Church reserves its consideration of the adequacy of these actions for the time being.

PWM128

Ms. Kinnard

any such development - namely, the installation of a crosswalk, curb ramps, and signalization of the intersection of the heavily-trafficked Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street. The replacement of the Clubhouse, which saw infrequent trips to and from the site, with forty-nine (49) residential and three (3) commercial units necessarily an already over-used intersection, making it more dangerous individuals seeking to reach public transportation, or the grocery and shopping center just across Grossmont Boulevard. Though the City is aware of these shortcomings, and the inadequacy of the existing road features, it neither required a traffic study nor institution of the improvements already required within the Circulation Element of the General Plan. Unless this Project is required to make these improvements, no other mechanism exists to fulfill the City's plans.
Backing this up, the Church has submitted its own expert analysis from Wood Environmental, dated November 9, 2020, indicating that the City improperly failed to evaluate the Vehicle Miles Traveled associated with the Project, as required by the State of California's Office of Planning and Research Technical Advisory on Evaluating Transportation Impacts under CEQA and pursuant to Senate Bill 743. Wood Environmental also notes that the City has not required the evaluation of "potential geometric hazards such as sharp turns, dangerous intersections, or points of vehicle/pedestrian traffic conflicts associated with the proposed site plan." Notwithstanding this, the City knows the arca to be hazardous as it has multiple reports of head- on and fixed object collisions at this location. This exacerbation of existing dangerous conditions is not only unconscionable, but it also runs counter to the law in that the Project was afforded an exemption from CEQA when it quite clearly will create significant impacts on the neighboring roadway and must be made to mitigate such impacts.
Instead, the City staff attempt to foist a meager $5,000 fair-share contribution for roadway improvements on the Project. But such a mitigation measure cannot be lawfully placed on a development purportedly exempt from CEQA review - the logic being that a development which is exempt from CEQA cannot be said to generate potentially significant impacts and, therefore, may not be required to provide mitigation where no impacts exist. (Anderson First Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173 1186-87.) Though the City appears to understand this conundrum, in its desire to offer an exemption from review, the City nevertheless elected to suggest that the fair share condition be imposed on the development in violation of CEQA. (See, Exhibit "53 Communications from Community. Development Director Kerry Kusiak.) This blatant violation of CEQA must be corrected by upholding the appeal, denying the CEQA exemption recommended by City staff, and requiring a complete and unbiased analysis of the Project's traffic impacts so that appropriate mitigation measures may be instituted. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102.)
The City also uses SDBL waivers in a manner that does not comport with the law in attempting to permit the Project the right to avoid compliance with the LMMC's requirements for the pedestrian realm. (LMMC § 24.18.020(E).) As mentioned previously, a waiver may only be

PWM129

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
July 14, 2021
Page 5 of 7

afforded to the Project when a "development standard will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development." (Gov. Code § 65915(e)(1).) Notwithstanding this, the Project proposes, and the DAB approved, the encroachment of balconies into the pedestrian realm because of "cost impacts [necessary] to incorporate the Open Space requirement and private balconies." This waiver request is clearly impermissible as it does not pertain to physical site limitations precluding construction but is instead merely tied to the development's potential profitability. Thus, the proposal is in violation of the SDBL and must all similar waivers must be stricken from the Project.
Nor may a development use the SDBL to overcome health and safety requirements imposed under the LMMC. Yet, that is precisely what the Project proposes, and what the DAB approved in permitting reductions in standard parking space and drive aisle dimensions though there can be no doubt that such cutbacks will endanger life and property by increasing the likelihood and frequency of car accidents. The City's parking space and drive aisle requirements are not randomly devised, but rather carefully determined to afford the public safe conditions within parking facilities. (LMMC § 22.112.010(B).) To reduce such safety conditions under the guise of an SDBL waiver runs directly counter to the law. (Gov. Code § 65915(e)(1) [Nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted to require a local government to waive or reduce development standards if the waiver or reduction would have a specific, adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5, upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact.] Emphasis added.) Given this, the Project cannot be approved as proposed in light of the immediate health and safety impacts raised by its reductions in standards attendant to the protection of the
public.
Further, the DAB blatantly disregarded the facts that its members, and City staff, knew to be true, that the Clubhouse is a historically important site in the region for a number of reasons. (Exhibits 6-8 [Emails from Planner Allyson Kinnard, Community Development Director Kusiak, and (then-assistant) City Manager Greg Humora, each imparting the significance of the Clubhouse, as well as the need for CEQA review, if not the preparation of an environmental impact report, to permit its modification].) Simply speaking, the Clubhouse is a historically important site due to its distinctive architecture, the well-known and respected architect that designed and oversaw its construction, and the La Mesa Woman's Club's many, extensive contributions to the City of La Mesa and the region - likely meeting three of the four criteria for historical designation under State law, and up to six of eight criteria for designation under the LMMC. (Public Resources Code 5024.1; LMMC § 25.03.010(A thru F).) The Project's historical report (Historical Resource Assessment in Support of the CityMark Mixed-Use Development Project, La Mesa, San Diego County, California, dated August 19, 2020) is clearly deficient and appears to be directly intended to give the impression that the site should not be considered historic notwithstanding the facts.

PWM130

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard

The Project report indicates that the project architect was Herluf Jensen Brydegaard described by Modern San Diego as "[n]ationally recognized for his school designs." (https://modernsandiego.com/people/herluf-jensen-brydegaard.Threeof Brydegaard's works were recently represented in a tour of historically significant architectural works in just the Clairemont community of San Diego, including the Clairemont Branch Public Library, the Del Sol Academy, and the George W. Marston Junior High School, all of which have distinctly similar architectural characteristics to those found at the Clubhouse.
(http://www.sohosandiego.org/tourbooklets/clairemontTour061616.pdf.) And his works are understood to be part of the historical archive kept by the San Diego Historical Society. The Project report clearly offers little insight in that it describes Brydegaard's career as "long" though Brydegaard had a prolific career as acknowledged by the report, he passed away at age 45, in 1960, the same year the Clubhouse was opened. Such an obvious lack of care in the preparation of a historical analysis should be offered no weight when faced with the obvious value inherent in the
site.

Further, the report acknowledges that the "La Mesa Women's [sic] Club made many contributions to the betterment of the region" but goes on to say that it no significant events are associated with the history of La Mesa. This runs counter to basic logic in that this service organization in existence since 1902 held meetings for five decades in the Clubhouse where all of their good works and "many contributions" were devised and planned out, but because little research was performed (or disclosed) the report declares no historical value should be assigned to the Clubhouse, and that no individuals important in local history are associated with the site. In short, the report is clearly lacking in objectivity and intended to permit the demolition of a historically important feature of the La Mesa community.
To that end, the Church has hired its own historical expert, Kiley Wallace, who has indicated that the Clubhouse does, in fact, have historical value as to its architectural features similar to others he has promoted successfully for designation in the San Diego County region. Mr. Wallace will provide further details on this in his own correspondence and will review the site for nomination for historical designation.
In light of these facts, the City must require further analysis under LMMC Title 25 to determine the historic nature of the Clubhouse and to determine whether it may be demolished at all. This further portends that the SDBL may not be applicable to the Project in that historically designated sites may not be afforded waivers or incentives by law. (Gov. Code §§ 65915(d)(1)(B), 65915(c)(1).)

Conclusion

The Project, as proposed and previously approved by the void determination made by defunct, must be sent back for further revision in compliance with local and state law. On its face, the Project will generate potentially significant impacts on the environment such that an exemption

under CEQA is impermissible, it fails to comport with its zoning and Gencral Plan requirements and implements the SDBL in a manner not allowed under the law. In light of these facts, and the law, the Planning Commission is obligated to is uphold the Church's appeal.

Re: Appeal of March 8, 2021 Development Advisory Board Determination Regarding Project
No. 2020-16

Dear Ms. Wiegelman:
This correspondence shall serve as a request to appeal the March 8, 2021 City of La Mesa ("City") Development Advisory Board ("DAB") approval of the CityMark Communities LLC (*Applicant") development project, and exemption from the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California, also known as Project No. 2020-16 (the "Project').
Appeal of DAB Determination
Pursuant to La Mesa Municipal Code sections 2.08.051 and 24.02.035, this firm, acting on behalf of its client, St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California ("St. Luke's") located at 5150 Wilson Street, hereby timely appeals the DAB's March 8, 2021 approval of the Project and its exemption from review under CEQA, and attaches a check in the amount of one hundred dollars
($100.00) (a copy of which is presented with the clectronic version of the correspondence as Exhibit "A"). As the neighboring property owner representing the interests of its congregation as well as the community at large, St. Luke's files this appeal in light of specific violations of CEQA, the La Mesa Municipal Code, including but not limited to the Project's zoning requirements and concomitant development standards, the California State Density Bonus Law (Government Code § 65915 et seq.), and the City's General Plan as iterated in the letter delivered to the DAB on March 8, 2021 and attached hereto as Exhibit "B."
In addition, certain representations made at the subject DAB hearing indicate that the Project is further violative of the law. We lay several of these issues out below:
1) In expectation of the Project's residents accessing the Grossmont Shopping Center directly across Grossmont Boulevard, the City's staff report to the DAB, at page 2, acknowledges that the "intersection [of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street] is not signalized and is lacking curb

PWM134

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Wiegelman, La Mesa City Clerk
March 16, 2021
Page 2 of 6

ramps and crosswalks." The Applicant's traffic engineer, during the public comment portion of the DAB hearing, indicated that the Project would install a crosswalk across Grossmont Boulevard. Yet. an examination of the Project plans, as reflected in the staff report, indicates no such street improvements are offered, nor is the City's approval conditioned on the installation of a safe, signalized crosswalk at this intersection - though it is well understood to be a dangerous location in light of the curvature of the street and speed of the automobiles moving through the area. Instead, the staff report, at page 5, provides "[a]s a condition of approval, the applicant will pay a fair-share contribution towards crosswalk improvements to the intersection." a Such a mitigation measure is improper in the following respects (beyond those points made in our March 8, 2021 comment letter
to the DAB): a. First, the imposition of this condition of approval shows the DAB, and city staff, recognize the intersection requires a crosswalk in light of the Project's addition of 49 households of new residents, and the additional pedestrian traffic expected from the Project's three retail spaces, directly accessing the Grossmont Shopping Center for shopping or parking purposes (the latter especially, in light of the Project's deficient parking space supply). This dangerous condition (i.e., no safe crosswalk, stop signs, or signals) will be heightened by the addition of dozens, if not hundreds, of additional individuals trying to cross Grossmont Boulevard on a daily basis - a clear and unmistakable impact requiring review and mitigation under CEQA. Yet, the DAB approved an exemption from CEQA review declaring that there is no reasonable possibility that a significant impact exists pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c). This determination does not comport with the facts, nor the City's determination that a condition on the Project is required to contribute towards the safety of this intersection. On this basis alone, the DAB's approval of a categorical exemption is without merit. b Second, the DAB's approval of a fair-share contribution, on its face, indicates that the City expects other neighboring future developments to contribute to the correction of the unsafe conditions at the Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street intersection due to the foresceable addition of more pedestrians and vehicles due to residential and commercial development in the area. This, too, indicates that the cumulative impact exception found at CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(b) ("All [categorical] exemptions... are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.") applies, such that the DAB could not lawfully approve a categorical CEQA exemption to this Project. C. Third, the imposition of a mitigation measure, such as a condition requiring a street a improvement, or payment of a fair-share contribution toward such an improvement, inherently indicates that the Project is expected to result in a significant impact. In such an instance, no categorical CEQA exemption may be granted. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102.) Notwithstanding this, DAB chairman, and Community Development

Director, Kerry Kusiak's attempt to waive this legal impropriety by arguing that the $5,000 contribution to street improvements is a feature of the Project rather than a condition imposed by the City runs counter to the plain language of the approval - the fair-share contribution is "a condition of approval" (staff report, page 5), and "[t]he applicant shall provide a fee in-lieu of $5,000 [sic] for construction of an ADA compliant curb ramp at the southeast corner of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street" (DAB Resolution No. DAB-2021-xx, at page 4, Engineering
Condition of Approval #21).
Moreover, the argument that this $5,000 contribution is a feature of the Project offered by the Applicant, rather than a mitigation measure imposed by the City, is patently absurd. The Applicant repeatedly indicates, in its own words, when (improperly) seeking waivers under the State Density Bonus Law, that the Project would be financially infeasible due to "cost impacts" if it were to meet the City's development standards (sec staff report, Attachment E, pages 2-5) - so, the Council would have to believe that the Applicant is claiming financial difficulty and simultaneously giving away cash to the City even though it was under no obligation to do so (and that there no Project impact to this intersection dictate the imposition of a mitigation measure). Such efforts to avoid CEQA must be avoided as an affront to the community this Council and its staff serve.
As further described in our March 8, 2021 (Exhibit "B"), this mitigation measure also runs
afoul of the basic tenet of CEQA jurisprudence that payment into a fair-share fee is only permissible if the fees are "part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency commits itself to implementing." (Anderson First Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173, 1187.) There appears to be no such plan, commitment, nor funds to implement, the construction of a crosswalk across Grossmont Boulevard at Wilson Street, nor any indication as to how the $5,000 condition of approval was determined to result in a "fair-share" of the overall expense in light of the Project's impacts - this is, of course, because there has been no lawful review of the Project's impacts at this intersection in direct violation of CEQA.
The City's Design Review Board, also on March 8, 2021, conditioned the Project's approval on the Applicant's provision of a traffic analysis to prove that the intersection of
Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street was inherently dangerous requiring deviation from the City's standard public realm improvements in the Mixed Use ("MU") zone. This condition indicates that the Applicant specifically seeks waiver of required development standards due to a hazardous condition to health and safety at this intersection (i.e., by adding numerous new pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles). Whether the waiver is granted, or not, the fact remains that the City acknowledges the Project will generate impacts at this intersection requiring review and mitigation measures such that a categorical CEQA exemption may not be approved in light of CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c).

PWM136

Ms. Wiegelman, La Mesa City Clerk March 16, 2021

Making matters worse, Mr. a Kusiak, also a Design Review Board member, declared that the traffic report required of the Project would not be prepared until the Applicant provided "construction drawings" for the development - such construction drawings are submitted when seeking building permits, well after the Project's discretionary entitlements have been considered and issued by the City. This, too, runs afoul of CEQA in that mitigation measures, and analyses, studies, and reports required to develop such measures in light of expected environmental impacts may not be deferred. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4(a)(1)(B).)
2) Throughout the DAB hearing, Mr. Kusiak incorrectly declared that the Project was a "by- right" development. A "by-right" development means the Project cannot be reviewed in a discretionary manner but must instead by approved ministerially. This is incorrect and runs afoul of CEQA in that it provides an inaccurate description of the Project likely to mislead the public, and other decisionmakers, as to their rights and the scope of analysis owed the Project under the law.

The California Supreme Court recently opined on this very issue clarifying the difference between discretionary and ministerial projects:
A permit issuance decision can be discretionary or ministerial depending on the circumstances. Those terms are defined in the CEQA Guidelines. A is project is discretionary when an agency is required to exercise judgment or deliberation in deciding whether to approve an activity. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15357.) It is distinguished from a ministerial project, for which the agency mercly determines whether applicable statutes, ordinances, regulations, or other fixed standards have been satisfied. (Ibid.) Ministerial projects are those for which "the law requires [an] agency to act ... in a set way without allowing the agency to use its own judgment...." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15002, subd. (iX(1).) They involve "little or no personal judgment by the public official as to the wisdom or manner of carrying out the project. The public official merely applies the law to the facts as presented but uses no special discretion or judgment in reaching a decision." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15369.)
[Protecting Our Water & Environmental Resources v. County of Stanislaus (2020) 10 Cal.5th 479, 489.1
On its face, the Project requires the approval of a Site Development Plan in light of its MU zoning. (DAB staff report, page 2 ["Entitlement review for new development in the MU zone involves site development plan review by the Development Advisory Board and design review by the Design Review Board, subject to City Council ratification."| The La Mesa Municipal Code, at section 24.02.034, further indicates that the review of a Site Development Plan is a discretionary process subject to approval, approval with conditions or denial, upon determining the project findings to be satisfactory and the City's design objectives are met, to ensure "that no detriment to

PWM137

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Wiegelman, La Mesa City Clerk March 16, 2021
Page 5 of 6

the public health, safety of welfare will result." Such a review specifically calls out the City's responsibility to use its judgment in deliberating whether to approve the Project's Site
Development Plan.
Moreover, Mr. Kusiak's declaration that the Project is "by-right" does not is comport with CEQA. CEQA specifically does not apply to ministerial projects. (Public Resources Code § 21080(b).) The very fact that the DAB sought to approve an exemption from CEQA pursuant to Guideline section 15332 indicates that the Project is discretionary in that a CEQA exemption is not applicable to ministerial projects.
CEQA is intended to provide the public, and decisionmakers, with accurate information about the nature and full scope of a development. (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angelcs (1977) 71 Cal. App. 3d 185, 192.) Providing inaccurate information, misleading the public, and other decisionmakers, as to their rights to review and analyze the Project is a disservice to the community and discourages thoughtful discussion necessary to shape a discretionary development review. (Id. [an "accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an informative and legally sufficient" review under CEQA.].) The inaccurate description of the Project must be corrected to
comply with CEQA.
Similarly, Mr. Kusiak stated that the DAB had no authority to deny the Project's requested waiver under the State Density Bonus Law due to health and safety concerns (raised, largely, with respect to the dangerous traffic-related conditions at the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street). This, too, is an incorrect statement of the law and the scope of the City's authority to review the Project under CEQA. As indicated in our March 8, 2021 letter to the DAB,
Government Code section 65915(e)(1) specifically provides that waivers of development standards under the State Density Bonus Law should not be granted when they would result in "specific, adverse impact... upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there iS no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact." Though the DAB (and the DRB), as well as the City staff report, acknowledge that the Project's waivers result in specific, adverse impacts upon health, safety, and the physical environment without offer of satisfactory mitigation, due to the claimed exemption from CEQA, with respect to public realm improvements (resulting in hazardous traffic conditions), parking space size and drive aisle standards (resulting in hazardous traffic and parking conditions), open space standards, landscaping standards, and other deviations from development standards, these waivers were approved due to an inaccurate statement of the law - claiming that the DAB could not deny the waivers under circumstances where specific, adverse impacts to health and safety are expressly acknowledged to exist. In light of this, the Project's waivers must be reconsidered and its impacts on the environment reviewed to determine what mitigation measures may be imposed.
Further, in light of the rampant inaccuracies, misstatements of law, and impropriety of appointing City staff (i.e., the Community Development Director, City Engineer, Building Division Director, and Fire Marshal) to review staff recommendations, and afford discretionary

PWM138

approval of projects, we strongly recommend the City reconsider its current practices. It does not appear that the composition of the DAB, nor the Design Review Board, afford any semblance of an impartial determination on matters of great importance to the public. Rather, these bodies appear to act as "rubber-stamps" on staff decisions. At the very least, the Council should consider having a municipal attorney staff each such meeting to protect the City's interests, and those of the community.

Sincerely,
Inl

Re: Project No. 2020-16 (CityMark Communities LLC) - 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, CA
Dear Ms. Kinnard:

This law firm represents the St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California located at 5150 Wilson Street, directly adjacent to the La Mesa Woman's Club ("LMWC"), the site of a 49 residential unit and three commercial unit mixed-use project ("Project") proposed by CityMark Communities LLC ("CityMark") known as Project No. 2020-16. This correspondence is offered to inform the City of La Mesa ("City") of our client's grave concerns regarding the proposed Project, the limited conditions recommended to ensure the health and safety of the public, and the apparent lack of analysis of the Project's expected impacts.
We also wish to bring to the City's attention that on December 17, 2020 this firm requested to be placed on the notice list for all public hearings relating to the Project, and specifically those relating to the California Environmental Quality Act (*CEQA"). Notwithstanding this, we were only sent notice of the March 8, 2021, 12:30 p.m. Design Review Board ("DRB") meeting after regular work hours, at 8:10 p.m., on Thursday, March 4, 2021 (see Attachment "1"), indicating that the City requires audio/visual presentations by the public to be submitted by "12:00 noon, one business day prior to the start of the mectirig." It would be practically impossible to prepare and transmit any presentation, let alone a thoughtful one, within three regular working hours of receipt of said notice (i.e., after 9 a.m. on March 5, 2021) to comply with the City's stated deadline. What is more, no notice was sent to this office of the March 8, 2021, 10 a.m. Development Advisory Board ("DAB") meeting though we understand that an exemption to CEQA analysis is to be voted on in this hearing. In fact, it is solely due to our client's diligence in searching the City's website, at approximately 11:15 am on March 5, 2021, that we learned of the DAB meeting at all again, making it impossible to provide the City with an audio/visual presentation by the 12:00 noon deadline set for that same day.
We understand that COVID-19 has altered the conditions by which we all live and work, and that the City is permitted to avoid direct communications from the public during such hearings

in light of California Executive Order N-29-20. Yet, the failure to afford the public a practical a opportunity to review, analyze, and respond to the Project's 137-page DRB staff report and the 150-page DAB staff report does not comport with the public's statutory and constitutional rights to petition its government under the Ralph M. Brown Act. (Government Code 54950 et seq.; Cal. Const., Art. I § 3, subd. (a) and (b)(1), (7).) These actions run afoul of the law as they present limitations on public participation which are simply "too arbitrary and capricious, too restrictive and unreasonable." (Nevens V. Chino (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 775, 778; see also Robins V. Pruneyard Shopping Center (1979) 23 Cal.3d 899, 907 (The right of the people to petition the government for redress of grievances is "vital to a basic process in the state's constitutional scheme."].)
Furthermore, should CityMark, or its consultants, be permitted to present audio/visual materials to, or communicate directly with, the DAB or DRB boards during these hearings on March 8, 2021 it will only heighten the inequities inherent in providing late, or no, notice to the public, with regard to the respective rights of the parties to petition their government. This would be an unfortunate, and likely unlawful, action in unequal treatment under both state and federal statutes and constitutions. A more reasoned action would be to postpone each of the DAB and DRB hearings by a week, or more, to permit cach party, and the public more generally, an opportunity to present their positions thoughtfully.
Notwithstanding this, we offer a limited summary of our client's position with respect to the proposed Project in the hopes that it will be presented to the DAB and DRB board members for review prior to any discussion of, or determination on, this matter. In light of the severely constrained time available to us before the DAB and DRB meetings, we will not reiterate cach of the points made in prior communications and correspondence delivered to the City in opposition to the Project but join in those comments by this reference. Rather, we will focus briefly on the inadequate analysis of the Project in light of the City's General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, the Project's inapt use of California State Density Bonus Law (Gov. Code § 65915 et seq.) waivers, and the impropriety of the claimed CEQA exemption under Guidelines section 15332.

I. The Project Runs Afoul Of The General Plan's Urban Design Element And The
Zoning Ordinance
As the staff reports to each of the DAB and DRB indicate, the Project site is designated as "Mixed Use Urban," corresponding to the Mixed Use (MU) Overlay, in the Residential Business base zone and is intended to support "pedestrian friendly housing." (DAB Staff Report, p. 2; DRB Staff Report, p.2.) Notwithstanding this, the Project seeks to avoid the very features it is obligated to provide to enable pedestrian-friendly housing.

The Project sits under 100 feet away, directly across Grossmont Boulevard, from the Grossmont Shopping Center. The closest supermarket to the Project is the Walmart Neighborhood Market therein, lying approximately 350 feet away, yet because there is no crosswalk, stop sign, and/or traffic signal at the intersection of Wilson Street and Grossmont Boulevard, a resident of the Project would be required to walk about three-quarters of a mile to safely cross the street, pick up groceries, and return with them - it is doubtful many residents will be able to lug an average family's weekly groceries this distance, on foot. (DAB Staff Report, p. 2 [In fact, the City recognizes this failing at the beginning of its report, "The intersection is not signalized and is lacking curb ramps and crosswalks."]; see also DRB Staff Report at p. 2 for the same acknowledgment of a dangerous condition].) Notwithstanding this, it appears the Project is being permitted to avoid the development of a crosswalk which is absolutely necessary for its residents or, at least, providing an analysis showing the Project will generate significantly more average daily vehicular trips and vehicle miles traveled than contemplated.
The City failed to require a traffic analysis for the Project, though it initially sought to require an ADA-compliant ramp be constructed at this intersection before apparently dropping this condition altogether. Our client's environmental consultant has also indicated this intersection is particularly dangerous because of limited sightlines arising from a substantial curve in Grossmont a Boulevard in this area. The observation that this particular intersection is dangerous has been voiced numerous times in correspondence submitted to the City by multiple parties. Yet the staff reports show that no ramp, crosswalk, or analysis was required of the Project -- instead, the Project is conditioned to provide a $5,000 "fair-share" payment toward a ramp to be built by an unknown party at an unknown time in the future. This does not comport with the law.

There appears to be no plan on file to develop a safc intersection at Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street, and the $5,000 payment does not appear to go towards any previously approved fund for that purpose. Nor is there any indication of how this figure was calculated. In Anderson First Coalition V. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173, the appellate court held that paying a "fair-share fee" is permissible as effective mitigation only if the fees are "part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency commits itself to implementing." That is not the case in this instance. In light of this, the City must require the installation of an appropriately signalized intersection, or some other traffic calming fcature here, or require the Project to present an analysis indicating why it should not do so. The only evidence in the administrative rccord, to date, on this topic shows that the City initially desired a crosswalk to be installed but backed off without explanation (or analysis available to the public, or the City's decisionmakers).

"Tn MU arcas, new development is required to include pedestrian realm improvements along collector streets to encourage pedestrian activity. The Circulation Element classifics Grossmont Boulevard as a major collector street subject to pedestrian realm requirements." (DAB Staff Report, p. 2; DRB Staff Report, p. 2. [Emphasis added.]; sec also La Mesa Municipal Code

PWM145

§ 24.18.040(B).) The condition to pay a fee in lieu of an actual mitigation measure regarding a known project impact runs afoul of CEQA and should not be permitted. Rather the Project must be required to perform an analysis to determine the scope of the impact and to then propose a mitigation measure to reduce that impact to a less than significant level.
Moreover, this mitigation measure is improper on two other bases. First, it improperly attempts to defer mitigation until later (and, in this case, unknown future) time. This is specifically forbidden under CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4 (a)(1)(B).) And second, a mitigation measure is only available if a project under CEQA is expected to generate a potentially significant impact on the environment, but the staff report indicates that the Project is exempt from CEQA because there are no such expected impacts. (DAB Staff Report, p. 7-8; see also DAB Staff Report, Attachment A, "Resolution No. DAB-2021-xx" at Par. 1.) So, either the Project is not exempt from CEQA and cannot be conditioned to mitigate a potentially significant impact, or it must be analyzed properly under CEQA (i.e., by preparation of an Initial Study, followed by specific impact category studies, and the development of a mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report). The status quo does not comport with the law. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102 [a public agency may not adopt mitigation measures for a project for the purpose of qualifying it for a categorical CEQA exemption; see also Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster
(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1200.)
A. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Limited To Overcoming Physical, Not Financial, Constraints Such That Avoiding Improvements To The Pedestrian Realm Are Not Permitted For This Project
As indicated above, the Project is designated Mixed Use Urban requiring improvements to the surrounding pedestrian realm. LMMC 24.18.020(E) defines the term "pedestrian realm" as
follows:

"Pedestrian realm" means a twelve-foot wide area located between the face of the curb of a Circulation Element designated street and the face of the building. The pedestrian realm includes the parkway, sidewalk, and landscaped areas. The pedestrian realm may include both public and private property where the public right-of-way is not twelve feet wide. Pedestrian amenities, street trees, street furniture, bus stop facilities, and other landscaping, as specified in this chapter, shall be included in the public realm.
r
Notwithstanding this acknowledged requirement, "[w]aivers are being requested to allow reductions in... pedestrian realm requirements." (DAB Staff Report, p. 3; DRB Staff Report, p. 3.) For instance, the Project seeks a "waiver" under the State Density Bonus Law so that it may encroach four feet into the pedestrian realm along Grossmont Boulevard by installing balconies hanging over this right of way. This miscomprehends what a waiver is under the law.

PWM146

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard

Pursuant to Government Code §65915(e)(1), waivers (as opposed to incentives) are afforded to a density bonus project only when a "development standard will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development," not because the developer desires it, or because it will enhance the financial prospects of a project. Put another way, a waiver permits deviation from, or altogether evasion of, regulations which affect a project due to its site-specific physical features. This subject site has no such physical constraints. Rather, the balconies could be built outside of the pedestrian realm (i.e., within the building envelope) by moving the exterior walls along Grossmont Boulevard back four feet, or removed altogether. The applicant itself makes clear that it is not a physical constraint that drives this waiver request when it states its justification as follows:
This waiver is requested due to excessive space and cost impacts to incorporate the Open Space requirement and private balconies. The loss of development potential to incorporate this would make the project infeasible to provide the affordable units.
As mentioned above, the site itself does not have any physical obstruction which precludes construction of these balconies, rather CityMark simply desires to have them overhang the pedestrian realm because it would increase their financial incentive to develop the Project. The State Density Bonus Law permits this sort of deviation from regulation for financial gain through the use of incentives, of which the Project has two (waivers, on the other hand, are unlimited for such developments). Yet, the Project avoids using any of its incentives and instead improperly requests at least five waivers to avoid its open space requirements, building height limit, parking space sizing, landscaping required within the pedestrian realm, and overall parking requirements. In each such instance, CityMark indicates that the justification for the waiver is not physical constraint unique to the site but rather the request is made to seek a financial boon for the developer.

The reason the Project seeks to use waivers rather than incentives is clear on its face - the
State Density Bonus Law does not authorize a sufficient number of incentives (i.e., the Project requires five, but only has two available to it) to meet CityMark's desired financial goals, whereas it may request an unlimited number of waivers. Because it does not have sufficient incentives to
develop the Project in this manner, it attempts to avoid their use altogether and instead make faulty justifications for waivers which are impermissible under the law.
Because CityMark cannot show a physical constraint exists which limits the development of the Project under the City's laws and policies, it must use its incentives (and justify the use of those incentives by showing the financial benefit gained thereby) and/or redesign the Project to be in conformity with the law.

B. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Not Permitted To Overcome Regulations That Pertain To Health And Safety
As mentioned above, the Project's requests for waivers are inapposite to the law becausc they pertain to financial rather than physical constraints. In addition, the Project improperly seeks to waive the City's standard parking space and driving aisle dimensions even though this would result in direct health and safety impacts. Waivers are impermissible on this
basis as well.

The dimensions of parking spaces and adjacent driving aisles are specified to ensure the safety of vehicles, their drivers and passengers, and pedestrians. (LMMC § 22.112.010(B).) This makes common sense - if spaces and driving aisles are too small, or otherwise constrained, they are likelier to lead to physical harm from other vehicles when vacating or entering a space and are the reason why State building codes requires minimum parking dimensions to ensure health and safety. (DAB Staff Report, p. 3 & Attachment D, pp. 3-4; DRB Staff Report, p. 3 & Attachment E, pp. 3-4.)
Government Code section 65915(e)(1) of the State Density Bonus Law provides:
Nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted to require a local government to waive or reduce development standards if the waiver or reduction would have a specific, adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5, upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is
no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact.
[Emphasis added.]
a Thus, a waiver cannot be used to avoid the specific, adverse impact arising from the reduction of a basic safety feature inherent in parking stall/space sizes and driving aisle dimensions as contemplated by the Project due to the health and safety issues it raises. No justification exists which would be sufficient to overcome this requested reduction in health and safety standards, nor would an incentive permit such a thing.
C. The Project, As Designed, Is Contrary To The Chief Land Use Policies Declared Under The Land Use And Urban Design Element Of The General Plan
California law requires each city and county to adopt a general plan, a comprehensive long- term plan for the development of that city or county, famously referred to by the state Supreme Court as the "constitution for future development." (Lesher Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 540.) A general plan must contain seven mandatory "elements," including a "land use element" to designate the level of intensity and general distribution of land uses. (Gov. Code § 65302.) "[T]he propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development depends upon [a finding of] consistency with the applicable general plan and its

PWM148

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
March 8, 2021
Page 7 of 13

elements." (Resource Defense Fund v. County of Santa Cruz (1982) 133 Cal.App.3rd 800, 806.) CEQA imposes an obligation on La Mesa to assess the Project's consistency with the City's General Plan. (North Coast Rivers Alliance et al. V. Marin Municipal Water District (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 614, 633.) The Project, as designed and proposed, cannot be found to be consistent with the Land Use and Urban Design Element of the City's General Plan.
By way of example:

1) Policy LU-1.2.2 requires that "[a]s part of the development review process, City departments will review all future development to ensure that safety requirements are met, including building and fire codes, accessibility standards and crime prevention techniques. Yet, as indicated above, the City's failure to ensure that the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street indicates that no such review has been performed (or that, if it has, the requirement to ensure safety has been obviated) such that a dangerous condition not only is permitted to exist, but it is being worsened by increasing the vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the area while also attempting to authorize a large development where a single-story structure currently exists, further reducing sight lines on a dangerous curve in the road. Similarly, the proposed waivers to reduce parking space dimensions and drive aisle widths do not "ensure that safety requirements are met, including building and fire codes, [nor] accessibility standards." 2) Policy LU-2.1.2 requires the City to "[s]upport infill development and subdivision proposals that reinforce neighborhood strengths and bencfit neighborhood identity," yet the Project proposes a development which is so different in character and intensity from any other in the neighborhood, both with respect to its architectural style and the materials used on its exterior walls - none of which can be found elsewhere in this community. Thus, it cannot be said that this Project will "reinforce" the existing visual appeal of the community.
3) Policy LU-2.1.5 requires the implementation of projects in the "Mixed-Use Overlay Zone by promoting the rehabilitation of properties and new development that fits into the context of the existing neighborhoods while meeting the City's Urban Design Objectives for infill development." Again, as noted directly above, in #2, the Project is completely out of character and context with respect to the existing neighborhood such that this policy cannot be met. 4) Policy LU-4.2.3 rquires that "[n]ew development shall provide adequate parking.' As the Project specifically seeks to not only reduce parking space numbers below the City's normal standards, it also seeks to reduce the number below those permitted under the State Density Bonus Law (albeit, improperly attempting to do so via a waiver, as indicated in the immediately preceding two sections of this letter). Also, as indicated in the immediately preceding section, the Project does not provide adequate parking not only with respect to the reduced number of spaces it proposes, but also improperly attempts to reduce the dimensions of the spaces and the drive aisles around them in a manner likely to impact the public's (and future residents') health and safety. Thus, the Project clearly conflicts with this policy as well. 5) Objective UD-1.1 requires the City's "[t]Jo protect La Mesa's existing built environment and cultural heritage." But the Project proposes to destroy the LMWC clubhouse

PWM149

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
March 8, 2021
Page 8 of 13

which has been in place for over half a century and, thus, conflicts directly and inarguably with this policy.
6) Objective UD-3.1 requires that development be "architecturally and environmentally sensitive and ..compatible with neighboring design and scale." As indicated in the discussions regarding Policy LU-1.2.2 and Policy LU-2.1.2 directly above, the Project is unlike anything in this neighborhood, especially with respect to its design and scale, and therefore, conflicts with this objective of the General Plan.
In short, the Project cannot be said to be in harmony with the City's General Plan Land Use and Urban Design Element as proposed. As such, it must be revised significantly to come into conformance with the General Plan, and the surrounding community.

II. The Project Fails To Comply With The California Environmental Quality Act
The primary purposes of CEQA are to inform City decisionmakers, as well as the public, about the potential impacts of a project, and to prescribe mitigation measures to avoid such impacts. CEQA requires a broad view of what constitutes a project requiring environmental analysis. (McQueen v. Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1143.) Even projects that appear benign will likely fall within the ambit of CEQA. (Bloom v. McGurk (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1307, 1312.) The California State Legislature formulated CEQA to "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of the environment shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions.' (Pub. Res. Code §21001(d).) To implement this goal, CEQA requires municipalities to analyze discretionary projects for potential environmental impacts utilizing a three-tier system. (No Oil, Inc. V. City of
Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 74.) The first tier is known as a preliminary review. The preliminary review requires public agency staff to analyze a complete application in order to discern the full scope of the project at issue. (CEQA Guidelines section 15060(b); City of Pasadena V. The State of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 810, 836.) Once the parameters of the project are established, a determination is made to resolve whether an exemption is applicable to the project. If such an exemption is found, the agency must determine that no exceptions to the exemption are triggered by the potential impacts from the full scope of the project. (CEQA Guidelines §§ 15060, 15061.) If the project is not exempt from CEQA, or an exception is applicable, the second tier of review is required wherein an initial study is prepared because it has been determined that there is a possibility that the project may have a significant effect on the environment. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063.) An initial study facilitates environmental assessment early in the design of a project. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063(c).) In the third tier, the initial study is used to demonstrate that either: a) the project "will not have a significant effect," triggering the preparation of a negative declaration, or b) the project is one "which may have a significant effect on the environment," triggering the preparation of an environmental impact report ("EIR"). (CEQA Guidelines § 15064.)

While the Guidelines provide opportunities for projects to be exempted from CEQA review, these exemptions are limited in nature. "Only those projects having no significant effect on the environment are categorically exempt from CEQA review." (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network, supra, at p. 1102.) A significant effect is a "substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in the environment." (Pub. Res. Code $21068. [Emphasis added.]) This means that an activity has a significant effect if, among other things, it "has the potential to degrade the quality of the environment." (Pub. Res. Code § 21083.) "[A]n activity that may have a significant effect on the environment cannot be categorically exempt." (Mountain Lion Foundation y. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 124. [Emphasis added.])
The courts review categorical exemptions using strict construction in a manner affording the greatest environmental protection within the reasonable scope of the statutory language. (County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 966.) "[E]xemption categories are not to be expanded or broadened beyond the reasonable scope of their -statutory language." (Dehne v. County of Santa Clara (1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 827, 842.) Thus, an exemption must be applicable in light of the full scope of a project.
A public agency has the burden of proving that substantial evidence supports its factual finding that a project falls within the asserted exemption. (Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose, 54 Cal. App. 4th 106, 114-115 (1997); Magan v. County of Kings (2002) 105 Cal.App.4th 468, 475.) "An agency's duty to provide such factual support 'is all the more important where the record shows .that opponents of the project have raised arguments regarding possible significant environmental impacts." (Muzzy Ranch Co. v. Solano County Airport Land Use Com. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 372, 386.) A city cannot impose a burden on the public to prove a possibility of adverse environmental impacts since this would frustrate CEQA's fundamental purpose of ensuring that government officials "make decisions with environmental consequences in mind." (Davidon Homes, supra, at p. 116; California Farm Burcau Federation v. California Wildlife Conservation Bd. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 186.) "[T]he agency's exemption determination must be supported by evidence in the record demonstrating that the agency considered possible environmental impacts in reaching its decision." (Davidon Homes, supra, at p. 117; East Peninsula Ed. Council, Inc. v. Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School Dist. (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 155, 171.)
The record before the City, limited as it is because of the lack of analysis performed by CityMark, reveals that the Project's potential effects on the environment make the application of a categorical exemption legally inappropriate. In fact, most of the environmental analysis performed, to date, has been by the church's experts and those analysis have not been challenged, nor apparently analyzed by the City.

A. The City May Not Apply The In-Fill Development Exemption In Light Of The Project's Expected, and Known, Potentially Significant Impacts
The City proposes to avoid CEQA review of the Project by employing the In-Fill Development exemption found at CEQA Guidelines section 15332. This exemption provides that in-fill development may avoid CEQA analysis if:
(a) The project is consistent with the applicable gencral plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations. (b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses. (c) The project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species. (d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality. (e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.
Our client has secured all Project materials the City purports to have in its possession or control via the California Public Records Act ("CPRA"). In securing this data, it has become readily obvious that very little analysis of the Project's potentially significant impacts to the environment have been performed to date. In fact, the only data in the administrative record analyzing the Project under CEQA has been provided by our client's environmental experts. These analyses, and the records produced pursuant to the above-mentioned CPRA request, indicate that though CityMark submitted an "Environmental Assessment/Initial Study Application" the City has performed no analysis of its own and has no Initial Study to indicate whether further environmental review must occur. Moreover, the expert analyses provided by our client, concretely and definitively specifies potentially significant impacts in the following CEQA
categories:
(1) Air quality impacts arising from construction. This is especially important in that the Project proposes significant grading - "400 cubic yards of excavation (cut) and 1,400 cubic yards of fill... primarily used to raise the rear of the site to establish a pad for the parking area [along with]... [a] retaining wall of up to eight and a half feet in height is planned along the south end of the parking area" - which is directly adjacent to the arca where 125 students currently attend the Warren Walker School, on the church campus. These students are sensitive receptors, spending time outdoors to learn and play, and with open windows, especially during the COVID-19 era, to provide additional ventilation limiting disease spread. (2) Noise impact arising from construction. Again, much like the air impacts category, directly above, but likely to last significantly longer as the construction noise will exist

PWM152

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
March 8, 2021
Page 11 of 13

throughout the site's development both before (during demolition) and long past (during construction) the grading operations. The noise from all of this construction will flow unimpeded into the directly adjacent school and playground disrupting hundreds of children's' education for what is likely to be a period of one to two years. (3) Hazardous materials disposal during construction. constructed prior to the elimination The LMWC building was
of asbestos-containing materials, lead-based paints, and polychlorinated biphenyls, yet no analysis has been made of these hazards (or methods to mitigate these potential hazards) upon adjacent residents, churchgoers, senior living facility residents, and/or schoolchildren.
(4) Hydrology and water quality impacts from the developed Project. The church's experts have analyzed the existing site, and the proposed Project at build-out, and determined that the Project's drainage study inaccurately describes the conditions such that considerably more stormwater is expected to flow onto the church property than reported. (5) Transportation impacts from construction and the developed Project. These impacts include significant numbers of heavy-haul trucks going through Wilson Street (designated a local collector) interrupting regular traffic and parking along the road, as well as church and school pick-ups and drop-offs, and a failure to follow the current standard in traffic analysis under CEQA, namely a vehicle miles traveled (VMT) analysis pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15064.3. And as indicated above, the analysis indicates the dangers inherent in the intersection at Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street.

But for the Project's hydrology and water quality analyses, the church's expert analyses on the remaining impact categories described above remain the only information in the administrative record such that the City cannot simply overlook the described potentially significant impacts. Neither the Project applicant, nor the City itself, have made any attempt to respond to these expert analyses such that CEQA requires that an initial study be prepared. (Hansen Brothers Enterprises, Inc. v. Board of Supervisors (1996) 12 Cal.4th 533, 560 [standing for the proposition that undisputed evidence in the administrative record must be relied upon.J.) Until such time as the Project applicant, or the City, rebut the evidence presented by the church's experts, and with respect to certain issues, the testimony, and opinions of laypersons, those remain the only materials upon which the City may rely in determining whether the exemption to CEQA under Guidelines section 15332 may be effective.
Under CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c), "[a] categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." Such an exception to CEQA Guidelines section 15332 exists in the administrative record in light of church's undisputed expert testimony as to impact categories described above. The City may not ignore evidence of an unusual circumstance creating a reasonable possibility of a significant environmental impact. (Committee to Save the

Hollywoodland Specific Plan y City ofLos Angeles (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1187; McQueen y Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1148; Lewis v Seventeenth District Agricultural Association (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 823, 211.)
In light of these facts, the City cannot use a categorical exemption to avoid further analysis of the Project and must proceed to prepare an initial study followed by the preparation of mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report permitting the public and the City's decisionmakers a thoughtful and reasoned opportunity to examine the totality of the Project and its potential impacts.

II. Conclusion

The City has failed to provide the public with a substantive opportunity to participate in a public forum regarding this Project in light of the inadequate (and with respect to the DAB, non- existent) notice, along with the practical impossibility of petitioning the government with a fulsome expression of the public's interests and grievances with regard to the development. The sharply limited deadlines needlessly imposed on the public do not comport with the law.
Further, the Project does not comply with the City's General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, the State Density Bonus Law, nor CEQA. In all, this Project must be sent back for significant further revisions and review.
We further note that the church is now engaged in a quiet title action with the LMWC, before the superior court, over the church's driveway to resolve the ownership, possession, and control of this area. Should the court determine that the church is the title owner of the land, the Project's total size will be sharply reduced resulting in a significant reduction in its base density, as well as any density bonus which may be afforded to it under the current proposal. Moreover, the Project seeks to install a tall retaining wall along this driveway, which will not be permissible upon the church securing explicit title in this land. And, the Project plans show that the church's driveway is being improperly shown as a fire truck access road during times of emergency though it does not offer access to the Project site given the steep slope separating the properties. In light of this, we strongly recommend the City hold back any decision which may result in confusing these issues or bringing the City into the action unnecessarily.

We note the DRB and DAB Staff Reports both inaccurately claim that the Project site at 5220 Wilson Street is owned by CityMark. It is, in fact, owned solely by the LMWC according to the church's latest information.

Subject: Brown Act Demand for Cure and Correction Regarding Development Advisory Board

Honorable Mayor Arapostathis and City Council:
This demand is made on behalf of this firm's client, St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California ("SLLC"). All further communications regarding this matter should be directed to this
office.

On March 8, 2021 at 10 am (PST), the City of La Mesa ("City") Development Advisory Board ("DAB") held a public hearing with respect to the prospective development of the La Mesa Woman's Club property at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California 91942 (the "Project"), and its claimed exemption from the California Environmental Quality Act (*CEQA"). Leading up to, and during the course of, that DAB hearing the City ran afoul of the Ralph M. Brown Act (Government Code sections 54950 et seq.; the "Brown Act") which requires the public be afforded various rights to be heard, and to hear, about matters of public concern such as the Project. These rights were violated, and this situation must be rectified by the City Council.
We present this correspondence in the hopes that the City Council will take this opportunity to cure or otherwise correct these Brown Act violations so that no further action need be taken by the SLLC to resolve these issues.

Violations of the Brown Act

1. The Brown Act, at Government Code section 54954.3(a), requires public agencies provide:

...an opportunity for members of the public to directly address the legislative body on any item of interest to the public, before or during the

PWM159

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Honorable Mayor Arapostathis and City Council
April 7, 2021
Page 2 of 5

legislative body's consideration of the item, that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the legislative body....
(Emphasis added.)
On December 17, 2020, this firm specifically requested to be notified of all Project and CEQA-related hearings. The City, through its City Clerk, acknowledged receipt of the request on December 28, 2020. (Exhibit "A".) Notwithstanding this, we never received notice of the March 8, 2021 DAB hearing from the City. Rather, our client fortuitously notified us of the DAB hearing on March 5, 2021 at approximately 11:15 am. Making matters worse, the DAB staff report indicated that any audio/visual presentation to be made by the public would need to be submitted by 12:00 pm on that same day - March 5, 2021. (Exhibit "B".)
As it is impossible to put together such a presentation, a and to submit it to the City, in the span of 45 minutes, SLLC was not able to present its position, in full, during the course of the DAB's consideration of the Project. This is violative of Government Code section 54954.3(a) in that the City failed to afford this firm, and the public generally, an opportunity to directly address
the DAB as required.
We strongly suggest the City Council correct this by ordering the DAB hold a new hearing on the Project and that the public be afforded proper notice of this new hearing.

2. The Brown Act does not permit the City to limit public participation a in a manner that is "too arbitrary and capricious, too restrictive and unreasonable." Nevens v. Chino (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 775, 778; see also Robins V. Pruneyard Shopping Center (1979) 23 Cal.3d 899, 907 [The right of the people to petition the government for redress of grievances is "vital to a basic process in the state's constitutional scheme."]; Cal. Const., Art. I, § 3(a), (b)(1), and (b)(7).
Yet, this is precisely what the City did in foisting a 150-page DAB staff report, without notice, on the public. It followed this violative action by then restricting the public's ability to participate in the March 8, 2021 hearing - the staff report indicated that public comments had to be delivered solely via email by 8:00 am on March 8, 2021, so that only the first 300 words of any such comment would be placed into the record before the DAB. Of the public comments that were read, the majority indicated they had insufficient time to review the staff report, and/or that they were elderly and without access to email (requiring the assistance of family members', with limited time and resources of their own, to register their position with respect to the Project). This, notwithstanding the fact, that each of the DAB board members, the City staff, and Project applicant spoke freely, and without limitation in fact, the DAB chair continued the Project's hearing repeatedly to permit one of the applicant's consultants an opportunity to appear resulting in the closure of the hearing almost two hours after it started. Yet, not a single member of the public was permitted to speak, or to present anything more than 300 words.

PWM160

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Honorable Mayor Arapostathis and City Council April 7, 2021
Page 3 of 5

In light of the egregious nature of the City's handling of the public comment portion of the hearing, which can only be considered arbitrary, capricious, restrictive, and unreasonable in light of the opportunities afforded to the Project applicant, we strongly recommend the City Council correct this violation of the Brown Act by ordering a new DAB hearing affording the public a right to be heard.

3. The Brown Act prohibits serial meetings - that is, a majority of the decision making members may not "use series of communications of any kind, directly or through intermediaries, to discuss, deliberate, or take action on any item of business outside of the public meeting. Government Code 54952.2(b). Yet, this is precisely what happened (and likely happens with respect to all DAB matters) in that each of the board members of that body are City staff members (Community Development Director Kerry Kusiak, City Engineer Leon Firsht, Building Division Director Aaron Sturm, and Fire Marshal Steve Swaney), all of whom by necessity of their respective positions specifically interacted with one another, either serially or in groups, to determine what impacts, requirements, conditions, and features the Project has, or should have.
Such discussions of the Project, and the DAB's ultimate outcome, run afoul of the Brown Act and cannot conceivably be corrected without the replacement of each of the board members with individuals other than City staff members. We suggest the City Council disband the DAB and appoint new board members whose positions do not require that they review, discuss, and otherwise weigh in on development projects which go before the DAB to avoid such conflicts going forward. We further suggest that in light of these circumstances, the DAB's approval of the Project, and its prospective CEQA exemption, be rescinded until such time as a new DAB board is empaneled.

Further, we note what appears to be a misconception on the part of the DAB chair, Mr. Kusiak. Throughout the DAB meeting, Mr. Kusiak claimed that this was "not a public hearing" a but was instead a "posted board meeting" which "did not require public noticing." This is incorrect.
Government Code section 54952(b) provides that the provisions of the Brown Act cover
"legislative bodies" which include each:

...commission, committee, board, or other body of a local agency, whether permanent or temporary, decision making or advisory, created by charter, ordinance, resolution, or formal action of a legislative body....
The DAB is such a "legislative body" for the purposes of the Brown Act in that it is a permanent board, created by the City through by ordinance and/or formal action. See, for instance, La Mesa Municipal Code ("LMMC") § 24.02.010 [specifying the responsibility of the DAB to review development proposals and specifically indicating it is subordinate to the City Council pursuant to Ord. 2600 §§ 2-6 formulated April 28, 1992); LMMC § 24.02.035 § [requiring site

PWM161

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV

development plan approval by the DAB]; § LMMC $ 2.66.110 [requiring the DAB to meet with respect to certain development projects pursuant to Ordinance 2457, July 14, 1987]; and LMMC § 24.02.037 (Ord. 97-2686 § 2 formulated November 25, 1997); LMMC § 22.04.010 (Ord. 2315 formulated May 26, 1983); LMMC § 18.18.060 (Ord. 2358 formulated June 21, 1984); LMMC § 22.03.010 (Ord. 2006-2774 § formulated November 28, 2006); and § LMMC § 22.02.010 (Ord. 2307; March 24, 1983.) In short, there is little question that the DAB is subject to the Brown Act.
A meeting is defined by the Brown Act as "any congregation by a majority" of the legislative body at the same time and place to "hear, discuss, or deliberate" on any matter within the jurisdiction of the body. The Brown Act, Open Meetings For Local Legislative Bodies, Office of the Attorney General, 2003, at p. 8. Because all of the DAB board members congregated
together, albeit by remote video conference, to hear, discuss and deliberate on the Project's site development plan and CEQA exemption, the requirement for a public meeting under the Brown Act is met. In light of these facts, the DAB's March 8, 2021 hearing on the Project was, and is, a public hearing subject to all of the requirements of the Brown Act, contrary to Mr. Kusiak's
assertions.

We strongly recommend the City Council direct the City Attorney, or other legal counsel, properly train the DAB board members, and the City staff more generally, on the requirements of the Brown Act to avoid such confusion and any further violations in the future.

CONCLUSION

Given the above points, SLLC demands the City Council:
(1) Acknowledge the violations described above and a make a commitment not to act in a similar manner in the future; (2) Afford the public reasonable opportunity to communicate with the DAB prior to, and during, all future public hearings of the board; (3) Revise the constituents of the DAB board to comport with the Brown Act; (4) Revise the LMMC with respect to the DAB board to comport with the Brown Act; and (5) Rescind any and all actions taken during the March 8, 2021 DAB hearing on the Project pending further rehearing by the reconstituted DAB.
The City Council must notify this office of its decision to cure and correct as demanded no later than 5 p.m. on Friday, May 7, 2021.
Should the City Council fail, or refuse to perform as demanded, this will serve as evidence of an actual and present disagreement over the public's rights and the City's responsibilities under the Brown Act and may lead my client to consider legal action as authorized by the Brown Act. It

the SLLC's sincere desire this action not be required and that the City Council take up the interests of the public, and its mandated duties under the Brown Act, without delay.

Glenn,

Sorry I was unable to pick up the phone when you called today. I have some litigation and mediation deadlines to meet this week, so likely will not be able to talk today or tomorrow.

I understand that the La Mesa City Council has not made a determination as to whether it will cure and/or correct the deviations from the Brown Act specified in our April 7, 2021 correspondence - please correct me if some action has been taken, as have received no notice of such action. My calendar shows that tomorrow, May 7, 2021, represents the last day upon which such a determination may be made, starting the 15-day clock for my client to file a petition for writ of mandate to seek the court's direction. As I will be out of town when this deadline runs, will be forced to file by April 21, 2021, I further understand from your voicemail, that you believe there may be some solution to this, or perhaps some other issues raised by St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California in its appeal of the Development Advisory Board's March 8, 2021 approval of the development proposal, and CEQA exemption thereto, at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, CA 91942.

My client welcomes workable resolutions to its claims, so would ask that you get back to me by email with sufficient time to avoid Iltigation - there is, unfortunately, not much time to do so in light of the short deadlines imposed under the Brown Act -so that I can quickly pass your suggestions along.

Dear Mr. Tinkov:
This correspondence addresses your correspondence as referenced above. Please note that numerous discussions have transpired among City staff over the years regarding the elimination of the Development Advisory Board (DAB) for various reasons. Your
correspondence has prompted City staff to begin the appropriate process for elimination (please see the attached emails between Kerry Kusiak, Director of Planning and Community Development and Greg Humora, City Manager). Furthermore, at my direction, new
development applications in the future will not be subject to DAB review.
believe this action should suffice to remedy any allegations of Brown Act violations that you
have asserted.

Also, because of the issues ralsed in your correspondence, if so requested by your Client, City staff would be happy to "redo" the March 8, 2021 DAB hearing on the development project planned at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California.
Please contact me with any questions, concerns or requests. Thank you and have pleasant

Thank you for your email,

After discussions with the City Attorney, we both agree that your suggestions regarding the DAB should be implemented, Therefore, in conjunction with the City Attorney's office (after consultation with the Mayor), I will be placing this matter on the Councll agenda for Its consideration as soon as possible, but no later than 30 days from today. Furthermore, at the direction of the City Attorney, as of today, no further new applications will be processed through the DAB. This action remedies any allegations of Brown Act violations regarding the DAB.

Subject: Development Advisory Board

Greg,
As we have discussed, the appellant's attorney in the Wilson Street project (2020-16) has also challenged the validity of the makeup of the Development Advisory Board (DAB) under the Brown Act. The challenge centers on the contention that the staff that make ug the DAB (Director of Community Development, Director of Public Works, Building Official, and Fire Marshall) have serial meetings in violation of the Act. The attorney notes that the staff on the board necessarily interact outside of public meetings to perform the function of project revlew.
In this regard, I think the attorney may be on point. To remedy this situation, I suggest that the DAB be eliminated as soon as possible and replaced with an administrative review process under the authority of the Community Development Director. The process could include some level of public review period of projects prior to a decision being made, with the possIbility of appeal, Since the DAB was established by ordinance, an ordinance would be needed to amend the Zoning Code to remove the DAB and insert the administrative process. If you are in agreement with this approach, we could have a staff report ready to introduce the concept to the City Council and receive authorization to proceed as early as the Council meeting scheduled for May 25, 2021.

Further, I would suggest that no new applications received going forward should be heard by the DAB. With that in mind, we would proceed immediately with an amendment once authorized to establish a new process as quickly as possible so as not to delay the project revlew process.

Subject: RE: St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California

Good afternoon Glenn,

I hope this message finds you well.

First, I must note an error in my message of May 6, 2021 below -I had mistakenly indicated that I would be required to file a petition by April 21, 2021 which, of course, would be impossible. I had intended to say that because of previously planned travel, I would have to file by May 21, 2021.

With that out of the way, I have reviewed your letter and while I appreciate what appears to be an earnest desire on the part of Mr. Humora and Mr. Kusiak to eliminate the Development Advisory Board, this response to St. Luke's April 7, 2021 Brown Act Demand for Cure and Correction is legally deficient. The Brown Act requires that the legislative body (i.e., the City Council) review the asserted violations in such a demand and to take action. (See, for instance, Government Code Section 54960.1(c)(2) ["Within 30 days of receipt of the demand, the legislative body shall cure or correct the challenged action and inform the demanding party in writing of its actions to cure or correct or inform the in demanding party in writing of its decision not to cure or correct the challenged action."].)
Though Mr. Humora is the is City Manager, and Mr. Kusiak is the Director of Planning and Community Development, I am not aware of any statutory or caselaw which would indicate they have the authority to respond to a demand of this nature in compliance with the Act. Of course, if you have some legal basis to believe otherwise, I look forward to
reviewing the material. Failing this, and in light of what I understand to be inaction on the part of the City Council with respect to my client's allegations of improprieties under the Brown Act, St. Luke's is forced to proceed as indicated previously (and corrected above).

Sincerely,
Felix Tinkov

Development Advisory Board

Dear Mr. Tinkov:

This correspondence addresses your correspondence referenced above. Perhaps further information will alay your Client's concerns regarding Brown Act Violations by the Development Advisory Board (DAB). First, a draft ordinance eliminating the DAB is scheduled for consideration by the La Mesa City Council on May 25, 2021 (agenda available on May 21, 2021) ("Ordinance"). Staff and the City Attorney's office will be recommending adoption. In La Mesa, the Mayor and the City Manager set the Council agenda. My strong anticipation is that the Ordinance will be adopted. In that event, obviously, the City will seek to dismiss any Brown Act lawsuit filed regarding the DAB and refuse any request related for Attorneys' fees.
Furthermore, as mentioned in my earlier correspondence, at the City Attorney's directive, no
new development applications will be considered by the DAB pending the final outcome related
to the Ordinance.

Thank you for your consideration and I hope this information has been helpful.

22 Brown Act, the California Constitution at Article I, Sec. 3, the La Mesa Municipal Code, and the
23 California Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP") §§ 1085 and 1060. ST. LUKE'S alleges as follows:

8. Venue is proper within San Diego County pursuant to CCP §§ 392 and 394 because
9 the actions (and inactions) complained of occurred in the County of San Diego, State of California.

10 9. ST. LUKE'S has standing to assert the claims raised in this Verified Petition for Writ
11 of Mandate pursuant to Civil Code § 1086, and Gov. Code §§ 54960 and 54960.1. ST. LUKE'S, and
12 its congregation, have a stake in this matter and are affected by the decisions made by the
13 Respondents as explained below. ST. LUKE'S has a substantial, direct, and immediate interest in
14 assuring that Respondents fulfill their duties to comply with the Brown Act in making decisions
15 which affect La Mesa residents, and more specifically, ST. LUKE'S itself. ST. LUKE'S will suffer
16 significant loss if Respondents' actions (and inactions) in violation of the Brown Act are permitted to
17 stand.

18 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS COMMON TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION

19 10. ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that on Monday, March 8,
20 2021, starting at approximately 10 am (PST), the DAB held a public hearing ("Hearing") with
21 respect to a proposed development (the "Project") of the property located at 5220 Wilson Street, La
22 Mesa, California - which site is directly adjacent to ST. LUKE'S church. This public hearing was
23j open to the public only through a remote video conference (no in-person attendance was permitted
24 due to COVID-19 restrictions enforced by the CITY), and the public's, though not the Project
25 applicant's, or its consultants', input was limited to the CITY staff reading aloud up to the first three
26 hundred (300) words of comments submitted by members of the public.
27 11. Prior to this, on December 17, 2020, ST. LUKE'S, through its undersigned counsel,
28 requested, via email, the CITY notify him of all public hearings relating to the Project and any
3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM185

- California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"; California Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.)

2 matters thereto. On December 28, 2020, the City Clerk of the CITY acknowledged receipt of said
3 request by replying to the undersigned's email. A true and correct copy of this request for notice and
4 the CITY's reply is attached hereto, and incorporated herein, as Exhibit "A".

5 12. Notwithstanding said request for notice, the CITY provided no such notice as to its
6 Monday, March 8, 2021 Hearing. Instead, ST. LUKE'S learned of the Hearing at approximately
7 11:15 am (PST) on Friday, March 5, 2021 upon perusing a CITY website on which a copy of the
g notice was published. Said notice indicated that the CITY would permit two categories of speech to
be made to the DAB, those by members of the public whose comments "must be submitted to
10 planning@cityoflamesa.us... and be no more than 300 words" and those of development project
11 "[a]pplicants who wish to make an audio/visual presentation pertaining to an item on the agenda,'
12 with no explicit limitation on length. A true and correct copy of this DAB notice for the Hearing is
13 attached hereto, and incorporated herein, as Exhibit "B".

14 13. ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, the CITY provides several
15 weeks of notice leading up to the Hearing to the Project applicant.

16 14. ST. LUKE'S was not given sufficient notice to properly review and comment on the
17 CITY's analysis of the Project (available at

18 (https://www.cityoflamesa.us/DocumentCenter/View/17152/DAB-2021-03-08), approximately one

19 hundred fifty six (156) pages in length, prior to said Hearing, in light of the CITY's failure to provide
20 sufficient and proper notice.

21 15. A 15-page comment letter, on behalf of ST. LUKE'S, was submitted to the DAB at
22 approximately 9:45 a.m. on March 8. 2021. Only the first three hundred (300) words of the comment
23 letter were read into the record by the CITY. The comment letter did not appear in the materials
24 presented to the DAB, nor was it made available to the public or the DAB for the Hearing. A true
25 and correct copy of ST. LUKE'S March 8, 2021 comment letter is attached hereto, and incorporated
26 herein, as Exhibit "C".

27 16. ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, the CITY read aloud the
28 first three hundred (300) words of comments on the Project from approximately twenty (20)
4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM186

members but did not permit (or offer any opportunity for) ST. LUKE'S or the public to speak
directly to the DAB during the Hearing, though the Project applicant, and its several of its
consultants, conferred with the DAB for well over the span of an hour. The DAB took action
pursuant to Gov. Code v0p 54952.6 in approving the Project and finding the Project exempt from
5 CEQA review.

17. Since the Hearing, ST. LUKE'S has been informed and believes, and thereon alleges,
7 the DAB members are senior CITY department officials, including Community Development
8 Director Kerry Kusiak, City Engineer Leon Firsht, Building Division Director Aaron Sturm, and Fire
9 Marshal Steve Swaney, and that some or all of these DAB members met with one another, at times
10 serially and/or through intermediaries, to discuss the Project as to whether it should be approved, and
11 upon what conditions, if any, prior to the start of the Hearing.

12 18. On or about March 17, 2021, ST. LUKE'S submitted its timely appeal (*Appeal") of
13 the DAB's determination on the Project and its CEQA exemption to the CITY COUNCIL pursuant
14 to La Mesa Municipal Code ("LMMC") § 24.02.035. To date, the CITY COUNCIL has not set a
15 hearing for the Appeal, nor has the CITY communicated with ST. LUKE'S in any manner on this

16 issue other than to acknowledge receipt of the Appeal. A true and correct copy of the Appeal and the
17 communications with the CITY regarding said Appeal are attached hereto, and incorporated herein,
18 as Exhibit "D".

19 19. On or about April 7, 2021, ST. LUKE'S delivered to the CITY COUNCIL, through
20 the CITY CLERK, a demand to cure and correct alleged violations of the Brown Act ("Demand") as
21 to: (1) the DAB's Hearing's limitations on public participation, (2) the CITY's failure to provide
22 proper notice of the Hearing, (3) the DAB members' improper communications regarding the Project
23 prior to the Hearing, and (4) more generally, the DAB members' improper communications as to all
24 other applications before that legislative body. A true and correct of the Demand is attached hereto,
25 and incorporated herein, as Exhibit "E".

26 20. On or about May 4, 2021 and May 5, 2021, the La Mesa City Attorney, Glenn Sabine,
27 communicated, via telephone call and voicemails, with ST. LUKE'S counsel a desire to resolve the
28 issues raised in the Demand, but offered no specific indication of what resolution was intended.
5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM187

21. On or about May 6, 2021, ST. LUKE'S counsel directed an email to City
2 Attorney Sabine requesting further information about the CITY's proposed resolution to the
3 Demand and indicating that little time remained before ST. LUKE would be forced to file this
4 litigation. A true and correct copy of said email correspondence is attached hereto, and incorporated
5 herein, as Exhibit "F

22. On or about May 7, 2021, City Attorney Sabine transmitted to ST. LUKE'S counsel a
letter indicating a claimed desire on the part of City staff to eliminate the DAB "for various reasons,"
8 that the Demand had "prompted City staff to begin the appropriate process for elimination" of the
DAB, that City Attorney Sabine had directed that "new development applications in the future will
10 not be subject to DAB review," and offering a "redo?" of the Hearing regarding the Project. A true
11 and correct copy of this letter is attached hereto, and incorporated herein, as Exhibit "G".

12 23. On or about May 11, 2021, ST. LUKE'S responded to City Attorney Sabine, via
13 email, indicating the insufficiency of the CITY's response to the Demand in light of the Brown Act
14 requirement that a legislative body, not the CITY staff, cure or correct the challenged actions and
15 inform ST. LUKE'S, in writing, within thirty (30) days of the Demand of the scope the actions taken
16 to cure. A true and correct copy of this email correspondence to City Attorney Sabine is attached
17 hereto, and incorporated herein, as Exhibit "H".

18 24. On or about May 13, 2021, City Attorney Sabine, via email, transmitted to ST.
19| LUKE'S counsel a letter, in Microsoft Word format, indicating that "a draft ordinance eliminating
20 the DAB is scheduled for consideration by the La Mesa City Council on May 25, 2021 (agenda
21 available on May 21, 2021)," stating his "strong anticipation... that the Ordinance will be adopted,"
22 and that he had issued a directive that "no new development applications will be considered by the
23 DAB pending the final outcome related to the Ordinance" along with an incomplete portion of the
24 second page which appears to a contain a portion of the May 7, 2021 correspondence. A true and
25 correct copy of this Microsoft Word document is attached hereto, and incorporated herein, as Exhibit
26 "p,

27 25. ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that, contrary to the claims
28 made by the La Mesa City Attorney, the DAB continued to review development projects after May
6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM188

7, 2021, and continues to review development projects at the time of this filing, as indicated by the
2 CITY's legislative calendar reflecting DAB hearings on May 10, 2021 and May 24, 2021, and the
3 agendas available for each of those public meetings
(https://www.cityoflamesa.us/DocumentCenter/View/17342/DAB-Packet-2021-05-10-Final and

5 https://www.cityoflamesa.us/DocumentCenter/View/17386/DAB-Packet-2021-05-24-Final,
respectively). A true and correct copy of the CITY's May 2021 legislative calendar is attached
7 hereto as Exhibit "J".
8 26. ST. LUKE'S is further informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the CITY
9 COUNCIL had not taken up the Demand within thirty (30) days of its transmittal nor proffered a
10 writing in response to the Demand indicating whether it would act to cure or correct any of all of the
11 alleged violations of the Brown Act made therein.

12 27. ST. LUKE'S is further informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the CITY
13 COUNCIL will consider the dissolution of the DAB at its May 25, 2021 public meeting, but that said
14 consideration is not to include contemplation, or further direction, the CITY COUNCIL with respect
15 to the points raised in the Demand, including but not limited to the DAB's March 8, 2021 approval
16 of the Project and its CEQA exemption, as well as the validity of the DAB's determinations as to
17 other projects reviewed by the DAB both before and after the Project, and the alleged failures to
18 provide proper notice and to permit public participation as required under the Brown Act. A true and
19 correct copy of the City Manager's Report to the CITY COUNCIL for the May 25, 2021 public
20 meeting (Agenda Item #9) is attached hereto, and incorporated herein, as Exhibit "K".

21 28. Having exhausted all available administrative remedies, having been offered no
22 writing from the CITY COUNCIL indicating its intent to cure the alleged Brown Act violations set
23 forth in the Demand, and being informed and believing, and thereon alleging that the DAB continues
24 to act in violation of the Brown Act, compounding violative actions it has taken in the past and not
25 yet addressed, ST. LUKE'S now seeks redress because the Respondents' failure to provide legally
26 sufficient remedy demonstrates that such actions will continue unless this Court intervenes.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 29. ST. LUKE'S realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 28 above,
3 as though set forth herein in their entirety.

4 30. The Hearing was "a regular meeting" under the Brown Act requiring notice pursuant
5 to Gov. Code $ 54954.

6 31. ST. LUKE'S requested the CITY to provide notice of all public hearings relating to
7 the Project, pursuant to Gov. Code § 54954.1, and all related CEQA matters, pursuant to 14 Cal.
8 Code Regs. 15087 ("CEQA Guidelines" § 15087(a).)

32. Because the Project is sited directly adjacent to ST. LUKE'S church, the CITY was
10 also required to provide ST. LUKE'S with notice of the Project's CEQA hearing before the DAB
11 pursuant to CEQA Guideline § 15087(a)(3).

12 33. Though the CITY informed the Project applicant of the date and time of the Hearing
13 weeks in advance of its March 8, 2021 date, the CITY failed to provide timely notice to ST. LUKE'S
14 church of the Hearing.

15 34. This lack of notice limited ST. LUKE'S, and the public's, participation in the Hearing
16 and mislead these parties about the Project which the CITY knew to be known to be of great concern
17 to the neighboring community.

18 35. ST. LUKE'S was prejudiced by these noticing violations under the Brown Act and the
19 Cal. Const., Art. I, § 3, because it was left with insufficient time to conduct an investigation into the
20 Project and the CITY's analysis of the Project as well as the associated CEQA exemption and was,
21 therefore, unable to fully participate in the Hearing.

22 36. In addition to the above-described violations, the DAB also committed the following
23 additional violations of the Brown Act and the California Constitution:

24 a. Though the DAB had the technical ability and time to afford the Project applicant,

25 and its consultants, unlimited and direct communications during the Hearing, it

26 limited ST. LUKE'S, and the public's, ability to petition their government by only
27 permitting the first three hundred (300) words of their comments to be read into

28 the record with respect to the Project and its CEQA exemption claims in violation

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM190

AU0E5O 0N N0 too of Government Code $ 54954.3. ST. LUKE'S was prejudiced by the DAB's
unreasonable and unnecessary limitation on its inability to communicate its
concerns regarding the Project during the Hearing. On the same date as the

Hearing, as well as before and after this, the DAB has repeatedly limited the
public's ability to petition their government in favor of project applicants, but

b. without any legal or technical basis to do so; and
Because the DAB consists solely of senior CITY department officials that had
previously reviewed, and extensively discussed (concurrently amongst
themselves, serially, and/or through their respective subordinates who would later
report to them) the Project, its CEQA exemption claims, and the conditions they
intended to place on the Project, the Hearing was little more than a sham
perpetrated on the remotely viewing, but silenced, public. On the same date as the
Hearing, as well as before and after this, the DAB's members reviewed and

15 unlawfully discussed other projects the DAB was required to review and vote

16 upon in public hearings pursuant to the Brown Act and the California Constitution
at Article I, Section 3.

17 37. ST. LUKE'S timely objected to the above-described violations of the Brown Act and
18 the California Constitution, through the Demand, and pursuant to Gov Code §§ 54960, 54960.1 and

19 54960.2 sought cure or corrective action.

20 38. The CITY COUNCIL failed to timely take up the Demand and further failed to timely
21 prepare and transmit to ST. LUKE'S an unconditional commitment, in writing, that it would cure or
22 correct each and every one of the violations raised in the Demand as to the Project, its CEQA
23 exemption, and all other projects reviewed prior to, or after, the Hearing - in fact, the CITY
24 COUNCIL failed to make any such unconditional commitment and now appears to
25 itself in a manner contrary to that required under the Brown Act. desire to absolve

26 39. ST. LUKE'S has a clear, present, and beneficial interest in Respondents' compliance
27 with the Brown Act, and the California Constitution, Art. I, § 3.

28 40. Respondents have a clear, present, and mandatory duty to comply with all
9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM191

1 requirements of the Brown Act, and the California Constitution, Art. I, 8 3.

2 41. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between ST. LUKE'S and the
3 Respondents concerning the Respondents' actions under the Brown Act and the California

4 Constitution, Art. I, § 3.

5 42. ST. LUKE'S now believes that Respondents' actions violate the Brown Act and the
6 California Constitution, Art. I, § 3, while Respondents contend to the contrary.

43. A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time.

8 44. Respondents have abused, and will continue to abuse, their discretion by violation of
9 the Brown Act and the California Constitution, Art. I, § 3, unless enjoined.

10 45. ST. LUKE'S is likely to prevail on the merits and establish that Respondents violated
11 the Brown Act and the California Constitution, Art. I, § 3.
12 46. ST. LUKE'S has no adequate or speedy remedy at law for the conduct "of the
13| Respondents described herein. Writ, declaratory, and injunctive relief offer the only means to ensure
14| Respondents will act in accord with the law.

15 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

16 47. ST. LUKE'S realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 42 above,
17 as though set forth herein in their entirety.

18 48. ST. LUKE'S timely filed, and paid for, its Appeal of the DAB determination with
19 respect to the Project and its exemption from CEQA review.

20 49. Pursuant to LMMC $ 22.04.010, the CITY was required to hear the Appeal within
21 thirty (30) days of its filing but did perform its mandated duty.

22 50. ST. LUKE'S has a clear, present, and beneficial interest in Respondents' compliance
23 with the LMMC.

24 51. Respondents have a clear, present, and mandatory duty to comply with the LMMC.

25 52. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between ST. LUKE'S and the
26 Respondents concerning the Respondents' actions under the LMMC.

27 53. ST. LUKE'S now believes that Respondents' actions violate the LMMC, while
28 Respondents contend to the contrary,
10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM192

54. A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time.

55. Respondents have abused, and will continue to abuse, their discretion by violation of
the LMMC, unless enjoined.

56. ST. LUKE'S is likely to prevail on the merits and establish that Respondents violated
5 the LMMC.

57. ST. LUKE'S has no adequate or speedy remedy at law for the conduct of the
Respondents described herein. Writ, declaratory, and injunctive relief offer the only means to ensure
8 Respondents will act in accord with the law.

10 WHEREFORE, PETITIONER PRAYS AS FOLLOWS:

11 1. That this Court issue a writ ordering that:

12 a. Respondent DAB perform as required by the Brown Act and/or the California
13 Constitution at Art. I, § 3 with respect to (i) the provision of proper public notice
14 for, (ii) the provision of reasonable public participation at, and/or (iii) the
429% discussion, deliberation, and/or taking of action on items of business only within,
public meetings;
b. Respondent DAB, CITY, and/or CITY COUNCIL rescind, set aside, annul, and/or
void the DAB's approval of the Project and the Project's exemption from CEQA;
19 and

20 C. Respondent CITY and/or CITY COUNCIL process the Appeal in accord with the

21 LMMC.

22 2. That this Court issue declarations that:

25 c. Respondent CITY and/or CITY COUNCIL violated the LMMC;

26 d. Respondent CITY and CITY COUNCIL, may not cure or correct Brown Act

Re: Project No. 2020-16 (CityMark Communities LLC) - 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, CA

Dear Ms. Kinnard:

This law firm represents the St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California located at 5150 Wilson Street, directly adjacent to the La Mesa Woman's Club ("LMWC"*), the site of a 49 residential unit and three commercial unit mixed-use project ("Project") proposed by CityMark Communities LLC ("CityMark") known as Project No. 2020-16. This correspondence is offered to inform the City of La Mesa ("City") of our client's grave concerns regarding the proposed Project, the limited conditions recommended to ensure the health and safety of the public, and the apparent lack of analysis of the Project's expected impacts.
We also wish to bring to the City's attention that on December 17, 2020 this firm requested to be placed on the notice list for all public hearings relating to the Project, and specifically those relating to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Notwithstanding this, we were only sent notice of the March 8, 2021, 12:30 p.m. Design. Review Board ("DRB") meeting after regular work hours, at 8:10 p.m., on Thursday, March 4, 2021 (see Attachment "1"), indicating that the City requires audio/visual presentations by the public to be submitted by "12:00 noon, one business day prior to the start of the meeting." It would be practically impossible to prepare and transmit any presentation, let alone a thoughtful one, within three regular working hours of receipt of said notice (i.e., after 9 a.m. on March 5, 2021) to comply with the City's stated deadline. What is more, no notice was sent to this office of the March 8, 2021, 10 a.m. Development Advisory
Board ("DAB") meeting though we understand that an exemption to CEQA analysis is to be voted on in this hearing. In fact, it is solely due it to our client's diligence in searching the City's website, at approximately 11:15 am on March 5. 2021, that we learned of the DAB meeting at all - again, making it impossible to provide the City with an audio/visual presentation by the 12:00 noon deadline set for that same day.
We understand that COVID-19 has altered the conditions by which we all live and work, and that the City is permitted to avoid direct communications from the public during such hearings

in light of California Executive Order N-29-20. Yet, the failure to afford the public a practical opportunity to review, analyze, and respond to the Project's 137-page DRB staff report and the 150-page DAB staff report does not comport with the public's statutory and constitutional rights to petition its government under the Ralph M. Brown Act. (Government Code 54950 et seq.; Cal. Const., Art. I § 3, subd. (a) and (b)(1), (7).) These actions run afoul of the law as they present limitations on public participation which are simply "too arbitrary and capricious, too restrictive and unreasonable." (Nevens V. Chino (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 775, 778; see also Robins v. Pruneyard Shopping Center (1979) 23 Cal.3d 899, 907 [The right of the people to petition the government for redress of grievances is "vital to a basic process in the state's constitutional scheme."].)

Furthermore, should CityMark, or its consultants, be permitted to present audio/visual materials to, or communicate directly with, the DAB or DRB boards during these hearings on March 8, 2021 it will only heighten the inequities inherent in providing late, or no, notice to the public, with regard to the respective rights of the parties to petition their government. This would be an unfortunate, and likely unlawful, action in unequal treatment under both state and federal statutes and constitutions. A more reasoned action would be to postpone each of the DAB and DRB hearings by a week, or more, to permit each party, and the public more generally, an opportunity to present their positions thoughtfully.
Notwithstanding this, we offer a limited summary of our client's position with respect to the proposed Project in the hopes that it will it be presented to the DAB and DRB board members
for review prior to any discussion of, or determination on, this matter. In light of the severely constrained time available to us before the DAB and DRB meetings, we will not reiterate each of the points made in prior communications and correspondence delivered to the City in opposition to the Project but join in those comments by this reference. Rather, we will focus briefly on the inadequate analysis of the Project in light of the City's General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, the Project's inapt use of California State Density Bonus Law (Gov. Code § 65915 et seq.) waivers, and the impropriety of the claimed CEQA exemption under Guidelines section 15332.

I. The Project Runs Afoul Of The General Plan's Urban Design Element And The
Zoning Ordinance
As the staff reports to each of the DAB and DRB indicate, the Project site is designated as "Mixed Use Urban," corresponding to the Mixed Use (MU) Overlay, in the Residential Business base zone and is intended to support "pedestrian friendly housing." (DAB Staff Report, p. 2; DRB Staff Report, p.2.) Notwithstanding this, the Project seeks to avoid the very features it is obligated to provide to enable pedestrian-friendly housing.

The Project sits under 100 fect away, directly across Grossmont Boulevard, from the Grossmont Shopping Center. The closest supermarket to the Project is the Walmart Neighborhood Market therein, lying approximately 350 feet away, yet because there is no crosswalk, stop sign, and/or traffic signal at the intersection of Wilson Street and Grossmont Boulevard, a resident of the Project would be required to walk about three-quarters of a mile to safely cross the street, pick up groceries, and return with them it is doubtful many residents will be able to lug an average family's weekly groceries this distance, on foot. (DAB Staff Report, p. 2 [In fact, the City recognizes this failing at the beginning of its report, "The intersection is not signalized and is lacking curb ramps and crosswalks."]; see also DRB Staff Report at p. 2 for the same
acknowledgment of a dangerous condition].) Notwithstanding this, it appears the Project is being permitted to avoid the development of a crosswalk which is absolutely necessary for its residents or, at least, providing an analysis showing the Project will generate significantly more average daily vehicular trips and vehicle miles traveled than contemplated.
The City failed to require a traffic analysis for the Project, though it initially sought to require an ADA-compliant ramp be constructed at this intersection before apparently dropping this condition altogether. Our client's environmental consultant has also indicated this intersection is particularly dangerous because of limited sightlines arising from a substantial curve in Grossmont Boulevard in this area. The observation that this particular intersection is dangerous has been voiced numerous times in correspondence submitted to the City by multiple parties. Yet the staff reports show that no ramp, crosswalk, or analysis was required of the Project - instead, the Project is conditioned to provide a $5,000 "fair-share" payment toward a ramp to be built by an unknown
party at an unknown time in the future. This does not comport with the law.
There appears to be no plan on file to develop a safe intersection at Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street, and the $5,000 payment does not appear to go towards any previously approved fund for that purpose. Nor is there any indication of how this figure was calculated. In Anderson First Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173, the appellate court held that paying a "fair-share fee" is permissible as effective mitigation only if the fees are "part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency commits itself to implementing." That is not the case in this instance. In light of this, the City must require the installation of an appropriately signalized intersection, or some other traffic calming feature here, or require the Project to present an analysis indicating why it should not do so. The only evidence in the administrative record, to date, on this topic shows that the City initially desired a crosswalk to be installed but backed off without explanation (or analysis available to the public, or the City's
decisionmakers).
"In MU areas, new development is required to include pedestrian realm improvements along collector streets to encourage pedestrian activity. The Circulation Element classifies Grossmont Boulevard as a major collector street subject to pedestrian realm requirements.' (DAB Staff Report, p. 2; DRB Staff Report, p. 2. [Emphasis added.]; see also La Mesa Municipal Code

PWM211

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard

§ 24.18.040(B).) The condition to pay a fee in lieu of an actual mitigation measure regarding a known project impact runs afoul of CEQA and should not be permitted. Rather the Project must be required to perform an analysis to determine the scope of the impact and to then propose a mitigation measure to reduce that impact to a less than significant level.
Moreover, this mitigation measure is improper on two other bases. First, it improperly attempts to defer mitigation until a later (and, in this case, unknown future) time. This is specifically forbidden under CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4 (a)(1)(B).) And second, a mitigation measure is only available if a project under CEQA is expected to generate a potentially significant impact on the environment, but the staff report indicates that the Project is exempt from CEQA because there are no such expected impacts. (DAB Staff Report, p. 7-8; see also DAB Staff Report, Attachment A, "Resolution No. DAB-2021-xx" at Par. 1.) So, either the Project is not exempt from CEQA and cannot be conditioned to mitigate a potentially significant impact, or it must be analyzed properly under CEQA (i.e., by preparation of an Initial Study, followed by specific impact category studies, and the development of a mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report). The status quo does not comport with the law. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network V. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102 [a public agency may not adopt mitigation measures for a project for the purpose of qualifying it for a categorical CEQA exemption; see also Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1200.)
A. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Limited To Overcoming Physical, Not Financial, Constraints Such That Avoiding Improvements To The Pedestrian Realm Are Not Permitted For This Project
As indicated above, the Project is designated Mixed Use Urban requiring improvements to the surrounding pedestrian realm. LMMC § 24.18.020(E) defines the term "pedestrian realm" as follows:

"Pedestrian realm" means a twelve-foot wide area located between the face of the curb of a Circulation Element designated street and the face of the building. The pedestrian realm includes the parkway, sidewalk, and landscaped areas. The pedestrian realm may include both public and private property where the public right-of-way is not twelve feet wide. Pedestrian amenities, street trees, street furniture, bus stop facilities, and other landscaping, as specified in this chapter, shall be included in the public realm.

Notwithstanding this acknowledged requirement, "[w]aivers are being requested to allow reductions in... pedestrian realm requirements." (DAB Staff Report, p. 3; DRB Staff Report, p. 3.) For instance, the Project seeks a "waiver" under the State Density Bonus Law SO that it may encroach four feet into the pedestrian realm along Grossmont Boulevard by installing balconies hanging over this right of way. This miscomprehends what a waiver is under the law.

PWM212

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard

Page 5 of 13

Pursuant to Government Code §65915(e)(1), waivers (as opposed to incentives) are afforded to a density bonus project only when a "development standard will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development," not because the developer desires it, or because it will enhance the financial prospects of project. Put another way, a waiver permits deviation from, or altogether evasion of, regulations which affect a project due to its site-specific physical features. This subject site has no such physical constraints. Rather, the balconies could be built outside of the pedestrian realm (i.e., within the building envelope) by moving the exterior
walls along Grossmont Boulevard back four feet, or removed altogether. The applicant itself makes clear that it is not a physical constraint that drives this waiver request when it states its
justification as follows:
This waiver is requested due to excessive space and cost impacts to incorporate the Open Space requirement and private balconies. The loss of development potential to incorporate this would make the project infeasible to provide the affordable units.
As mentioned above, the site itself does not have any physical obstruction which precludes construction of these balconies, rather CityMark simply desires to have them overhang the pedestrian realm because it would increase their financial incentive to develop the Project. The State Density Bonus Law permits this sort of deviation from regulation for financial gain through the use of incentives, of which the Project has two (waivers, on the other hand, are unlimited for such developments). Yet, the Project avoids using any of its incentives and instead improperly
requests at least five waivers to avoid its open space requirements, building height limit, parking space sizing, landscaping required within the pedestrian realm, and overall parking requirements. In each such instance, CityMark indicates that the justification for the waiver is not a physical constraint unique to the site but rather the request is made to seek a financial boon for the
developer.
The reason the Project seeks to use waivers rather than incentives is clear on its face - the State Density Bonus Law does not authorize a sufficient number of incentives (i.e., the Project requires five, but only has two available to it) to meet CityMark's desired financial goals, whereas it may request an unlimited number of waivers. Because it does not have sufficient incentives to develop the Project in this manner, it attempts to avoid their use altogether and instead make faulty justifications for waivers which are impermissible under the law.
Because CityMark cannot show a physical constraint exists which limits the development of the Project under the City's laws and policies, it must use its incentives (and justify the use of those incentives by showing the financial benefit gained thereby) and/or redesign the Project to be
in conformity with the law.

B. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Not Permitted To Overcome Regulations That Pertain To Health And Safety
As mentioned above, the Project's requests for waivers are inapposite to the law because they pertain to financial rather than physical constraints. In addition, the Project improperly seeks to waive the City's standard parking space and driving aisle dimensions even though this would result in direct health and safety impacts. Waivers are impermissible on this basis as well.

The dimensions of parking spaces and adjacent driving aisles are specified to ensure the safety of vehicles, their drivers and passengers, and pedestrians. (LMMC § 22.112.010(B).) This makes common sense - if spaces and driving aisles are too small, or otherwise constrained, they
are likelier to lead to physical harm from other vehicles when vacating or entering a space and are the reason why State building codes requires minimum parking dimensions to ensure health and safety. (DAB Staff Report, p. 3 & Attachment D, Pp. 3-4; DRB Staff Report, p. 3 & Attachment E, pp. 3-4.)
Government Code section 65915(e)(1) of the State Density Bonus Law provides:
Nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted to require a local government to
waive or reduce development standards if the waiver or reduction would have :
specific, adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5, upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact. [Emphasis added.]
Thus, a waiver cannot be used to avoid the specific, adverse impact arising from the reduction of a basic safety feature inherent in parking stall/space sizes and driving aisle dimensions as contemplated by the Project due to the health and safety issues it raises. No justification exists which would be sufficient to overcome this requested reduction in health and safety standards, nor would an incentive permit such a thing.
C. The Project, As Designed, Is Contrary To The Chief Land Use Policies Declared Under
The Land Use And Urban Design Element Of The General Plan
California law requires each city and county to adopt a general plan, a comprehensive long- term plan for the development of that city or county, famously referred to by the state Supreme Court as the "constitution for future development." (Lesher Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 540.) A general plan must contain seven mandatory "elements," including a "land use element" to designate the level of intensity and general distribution of land uses. (Gov. Code § 65302.) "[T]he propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development depends upon [a finding of] consistency with the applicable general plan and its

PWM214

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard

elements." (Resource Defense Fund V. County of Santa Cruz (1982) 133 Cal.App.3rd 800, 806.) CEQA imposes an obligation on La Mesa to assess the Project's consistency with the City's General Plan. (North Coast Rivers Alliance et al, v. Marin Municipal Water District (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 614, 633.) The Project, as designed and proposed, cannot be found to be consistent with the Land Use and Urban Design Element of the City's General Plan.
By way of example:

1) Policy LU-1.2.2 requires that "[a]s part of the development review process, City departments will review all future development to ensure that safety requirements are met, including building and fire codes, accessibility standards and crime prevention techniques. Yet, as indicated above, the City's failure to ensure that the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street indicates that no such review has been performed (or that, if it has, the requirement to ensure safety has been obviated) such that a dangerous condition not only is permitted to exist, but it is being worsened by increasing the vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the area while also attempting to authorize a large development where a single-story structure currently exists, further reducing sight lines on a dangerous curve in the road. Similarly, the proposed waivers to reduce
parking space dimensions and drive aisle widths do not "ensure that safety requirements are met, including building and fire codes, [nor] accessibility standards."
2) Policy LU-2.1.2 requires the City to "[s]upport infill development and subdivision proposals that reinforce neighborhood strengths and benefit neighborhood identity, yet the Project proposes a development which is so different in character and intensity from any other in the neighborhood, both with respect to its architectural style and the materials used on its exterior walls - none of which can be found elsewhere in this community. Thus, it cannot be said that this
Project will "reinforce" the existing visual appeal of the community.
3) Policy LU-2.1.5 requires the implementation of projects in the "Mixed-Use Overlay Zone by promoting the rehabilitation of properties and new development that fits into the context of the existing neighborhoods while meeting the City's Urban Design Objectives for infill development." Again, as noted directly above, in #2, the Project is completely out of character and context with respect to the existing neighborhood such that this policy cannot be met.
4) Policy LU-4.2.3 requires that "[n]ew development shall provide adequate
parking.' As the Project specifically seeks to not only reduce parking space numbers below the City's normal standards, it also seeks to reduce the number below those permitted under the State Density Bonus Law (albeit, improperly attempting to do so via a waiver, as indicated in the immediately preceding two sections of this letter). Also, as indicated in the immediately preceding section, the Project does not provide adequate parking not only with respect to the reduced number it of spaces it proposes, but also improperly attempts to reduce the dimensions of the spaces and the drive aisles around them in a manner likely to impact the public's (and future residents') health and safety. Thus, the Project clearly conflicts with this policy as well.
5) Objective UD-1.1 requires the City's "t]o protect La Mesa's existing built environment and cultural heritage." But the Project proposes to destroy the LMWC clubhouse

PWM215

which has been in place for over half a century and, thus, conflicts directly and inarguably with this policy.
6) Objective UD-3.1 requires that development be "architecturally and environmentally sensitive and .compatible with neighboring design and scale." As indicated in the discussions regarding Policy LU-1.2.2 and Policy LU-2.1.2 directly above, the Project is unlike anything in this neighborhood, especially with respect to its design and scale, and therefore, conflicts with this objective of the General Plan.
In short, the Project cannot be said to be in harmony with the City's General Plan Land Use and Urban Design Element as proposed. As such, it must be revised significantly to come into conformance with the General Plan, and the surrounding community.

II. The Project Fails To Comply With The California Environmental Quality Act
The primary purposes of CEQA are to inform City decisionmakers, as well as the public, about the potential impacts of a project, and to prescribe mitigation measures to avoid such impacts. CEQA requires a broad view of what constitutes a project requiring environmental analysis. (McQueen V. Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1143.) Even projects that appear benign will likely fall within the ambit of CEQA. (Bloom v. McGurk (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1307, 1312.) The California State Legislature formulated CEQA to "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of the environment shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions." (Pub. Res. Code §21001(d).) To implement this goal, CEQA requires municipalities to analyze discretionary projects for potential environmental impacts utilizing a three-tier system. (No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 74.) The first tier is a known as a preliminary review. The preliminary review requires public agency staff to analyze a complete application in order to discern the full scope of the project at issue. (CEQA Guidelines section 15060(b); City of Pasadena v. The State of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 810, 836.) Once the parameters of the project are established, a determination is made to resolve whether an exemption is applicable to the project. If such an exemption is found, the agency must determine that no exceptions to the exemption are triggered by the potential impacts from the full scope of the project. (CEQA Guidelines §§ 15060, 15061.) If the project is not exempt from CEQA, or an exception is applicable, the second tier of review is required wherein an initial study is prepared because it has been determined that there is a possibility that the project may have a significant effect on the environment. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063.) An initial study facilitates environmental assessment early in the design of a project. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063(c).) In the third tier, the initial study is used to demonstrate that either: a) the project "will not have a significant effect," triggering the preparation of a negative declaration, or b) the project is one "which may have a significant effect on the environment," triggering the preparation of an environmental impact report ("EIR"). (CEQA Guidelines § 15064.)

PWM216

While the Guidelines provide opportunities for projects to be exempted from CEQA review, these exemptions are limited in nature. "Only those projects having no significant effect on the environment are categorically exempt from CEQA review." (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network, supra, at p. 1102.) A significant effect is a "substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in the environment." (Pub. Res. Code $21068. [Emphasis added.J) This means that an activity has a significant effect if, among other things, it "has the potential to degrade the quality of the environment." (Pub. Res. Code § 21083.) "[A]n activity that may have a significant effect on the environment cannot be categorically exempt." (Mountain Lion Foundation V. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 124. [Emphasis added.])
The courts review categorical exemptions using strict construction in a manner affording the greatest environmental protection within the reasonable scope of the statutory language. (County of Amador v. E1 Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 966.) "[E]xemption categories are not to be expanded or broadened beyond the reasonable scope of their statutory language.' (Dehne v. County of Santa Clara (1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 827, 842.) Thus, an exemption must be applicable in light of the full scope of a project.
A public agency has the burden of proving that substantial evidence supports its factual finding that a project falls within the asserted exemption. (Da vidon Homes v. City of San Jose, 54 Cal. App. 4th 106, 114-115 (1997); Magan v. County of Kings (2002) 105 Cal.App.4th 468, 475.) "An agency's duty to provide such factual support 'is all the more important where the record shows ...that opponents of the project have raised arguments regarding possible significant environmental impacts.'* (Muzzy Ranch Co. v. Solano County Airport Land Use Com. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 372, 386.) A city cannot impose a burden on the public to prove a possibility of adverse environmental impacts since this would frustrate CEQA's fundamental purpose of ensuring that
government officials "make decisions with environmental consequences in mind." (Davidon Homes, supra, at p. 116; California Farm Bureau Federation v. California Wildlife Conservation Bd. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 186.) "[T]he agency's exemption determination must be supported by evidence in the record demonstrating that the agency considered possible environmental impacts in reaching its decision." (Da vidon Homes, supra, at p. 117; East Peninsula Ed. Council, Inc. v. Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School Dist. (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 155, 171.)
The record before the City, limited as it is because of the lack of analysis performed by CityMark, reveals that the Project's potential effects on the environment make the application of a categorical exemption legally inappropriate. In fact, most of the environmental analysis performed, to date, has been by the church's experts and those analysis have not been challenged, nor apparently analyzed by the City.

A, The City May Not Apply The In-Fill Development Exemption In Light Of The Project's Expected, and Known, Potentially Significant Impacts
The City proposes to avoid CEQA review of the Project by employing the In-Fill Development exemption found at CEQA Guidelines section 15332. This exemption provides that in-fill development may avoid CEQA analysis if:
(a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations. (b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses.
(c) The project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species.
(d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality. (e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.
Our client has secured all Project materials the City purports to have in its possession or control via the California Public Records Act ("CPRA"). In securing this data, it has become readily obvious that very little analysis of the Project's potentially significant impacts to the environment have been performed to date. In fact, the only data in the administrative record analyzing the Project under CEQA has been provided by our client's environmental experts. These analyses, and the records produced pursuant to the above-mentioned CPRA request, indicate that though CityMark submitted an "Environmental Assessment/Initial Study Application" the City has performed no analysis of its own and has no Initial Study to indicate whether further environmental review must occur. Moreover, the expert analyses proyided by our client, concretely and definitively specifies potentially significant impacts in the following CEQA categories:

(1) Air quality impacts arising from construction. This is especially important in that the Project proposes significant grading - "400 cubic yards of excavation (cut) and 1,400 cubic yards of fill... primarily used to raise the rear of the site to establish a pad for the parking area [along with].... [a] retaining wall of up to eight and a half feet in height is planned along the south end of the parking area" - which is directly adjacent to the area where 125 students currently attend the Warren Walker School, on the church campus. These students are sensitive receptors, spending time outdoors to learn and play, and with open windows, especially during the COVID-19 era, to provide additional ventilation limiting disease spread. (2) Noise impact arising from construction. Again, much like the air impacts category, directly above, but likely to last significantly longer as the construction noise will exist

PWM218

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
March 8, 2021
Page 11 of 13

throughout the site's development both before (during demolition) and long past (during construction) the grading operations. The noise from all of this construction will flow unimpeded into the directly adjacent school and playground disrupting hundreds of children's' education for what is likely to be a period of one to two years. (3) Hazardous materials disposal during construction. The LMWC building was constructed prior to the elimination of asbestos-containing materials, lead-based paints, and polychlorinated biphenyls, yet no analysis has been made of these hazards (or methods to mitigate these potential hazards) upon adjacent residents, churchgoers, senior living facility residents, and/or schoolchildren. (4) Hydrology and water quality impacts from the developed Project. The church's experts have analyzed the existing site, and the proposed Project at build-out, and determined that the Project's drainage study inaccurately describes the conditions such that considerably more stormwater is expected to flow onto the church property than
reported. (5) Transportation impacts from construction and the developed Project. These impacts include significant numbers of heavy-haul trucks going through Wilson Street (designated a local collector) interrupting regular traffic and parking along the road, as well as church and school pick-ups and drop-offs, and a failure to follow the current
standard in traffic analysis under CEQA, namely a vehicle miles traveled (VMT) analysis pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15064.3. And as indicated above, the analysis indicates the dangers inherent in the intersection at Grossmont Boulevard and
Wilson Street.

But for the Project's hydrology and water quality analyses, the church's expert analyses on the remaining impact categories described above remain the only information in the administrative record such that the City cannot simply overlook the described potentially significant impacts. Neither the Project applicant, nor the City itself, have made any attempt to respond to these expert analyses such that CEQA requires that an initial study be prepared. (Hansen Brothers Enterprises, Inc. V. Board of Supervisors (1996) 12 Cal.4th 533, 560 [standing for the proposition that undisputed evidence in the administrative record must be relied upon.].) Until such time as the Project applicant, or the City, rebut the evidence presented by the church's experts, and with respect to certain issues, the testimony, and opinions of laypersons, those remain the only materials upon which the City may rely in determining whether the exemption to CEQA under Guidelines section 15332 may be effective.
Under CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c), "[a] categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect
on the environment due to unusual circumstances." Such an exception to CEQA Guidelines section 15332 exists in the administrative record in light of church's undisputed expert testimony as to impact categories described above. The City may not ignore evidence of an unusual circumstance creating a reasonable possibility of a significant environmental impact. (Committee to Save the

Hollywoodland Specific Plan City of Los Angeles (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1187; McQueen v Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1148; Lewis y Seventeenth District Agricultural Association (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 823, 211.)
In light of these facts, the City cannot use a categorical exemption to avoid further analysis of the Project and must proceed to prepare an initial study followed by the preparation of a mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report permitting the public and the City's decisionmakers a thoughtful and reasoned opportunity to examine the totality of the Project and its potential impacts.

III. Conclusion

The City has failed to provide the public with a substantive opportunity to participate in a public forum regarding this Project in light of the inadequate (and with respect to the DAB, non- existent) notice, along with the practical impossibility of petitioning the government with a fulsome expression of the public's interests and grievances with regard to the development. The sharply limited deadlines needlessly imposed on the public do not comport with the law.
Further, the Project does not comply with the City's General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, the State Density Bonus Law, nor CEQA. In all, this Project must be sent back for significant further revisions and review.

We further note that the church is now engaged a in a quiet title action with the LMWC,' before the superior court, over the church's driveway to resolve the ownership, possession, and control of this area. Should the court determine that the church is the title owner of the land, the Project's total size will be sharply reduced resulting in a significant reduction in its base density, as well as any density bonus which may be afforded to it under the current proposal. Moreover, the Project seeks to install a tall retaining wall along this driveway, which will not be permissible upon the church securing explicit title in this land. And, the Project plans show that the church's driveway is being improperly shown as a fire truck access road during times of emergency though it does not offer access to the Project site given the steep slope separating the properties. In light of this, we strongly recommend the City hold back any decision which may result in confusing these issues or bringing the City into the action unnecessarily.

We note the DRB and DAB Staff Reports both inaccurately claim that the Project site at 5220 Wilson Street is owned by CityMark. It is, in fact, owned solely by the LMWC according to the church's latest information.

Re: Appeal of March 8, 2021 Development Advisory Board Determination Regarding Project No. 2020-16

Dear Ms. Wiegelman:
This correspondence shall serve as a request to appeal the March 8, 2021 City of La Mesa ("City") Development Advisory Board ("DAB") approval of the CityMark Communities LLC ("Applicant") development project, and exemption from the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California, also known as Project No. 2020-16 (the "Project').

Appeal of DAB Determination

Pursuant to La Mesa Municipal Code sections 2.08.051 and 24.02.035, this firm, acting on behalf of its client, St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California ("St. Luke's") located at 5150 Wilson Street, hereby timely appeals the DAB's March 8, 2021 approval of the Project and its exemption from review under CEQA, and attaches a check in the amount of one hundred dollars
($100.00) (a copy of which is presented with the electronic version of the correspondence as Exhibit "A"). As the neighboring property owner representing the interests of its congregation as well as the community at large, St. Luke's files this appeal in light of specific violations of CEQA, the La Mesa Municipal Code, including but not limited to the Project's zoning requirements and concomitant development standards, the California State Density Bonus Law (Government Code § 65915 et seq.), and the City's General Plan as iterated in the letter delivered to the DAB on March 8, 2021 and attached hereto as Exhibit "B."

In addition, certain representations made at the subject DAB hearing indicate that the Project is further violative of the law. We lay several of these issues out below:
1) In expectation of the Project's residents accessing the Grossmont Shopping Center directly across Grossmont Boulevard, the City's staff report to the DAB, at page 2, acknowledges that the "intersection [of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street] is not signalized and is lacking curb

PWM226

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Wiegelman, La Mesa City Clerk

Page 2 of 6

ramps and crosswalks." The Applicant's traffic engineer, during the public comment portion of the DAB hearing, indicated that the Project would install a crosswalk across Grossmont Boulevard. Yet, an examination of the Project plans, as reflected in the staff report, indicates no such street improvements are offered, nor is the City's approval conditioned on the installation of a safe, signalized crosswalk at this intersection - though it is well understood to be a dangerous location in light of the curvature of the street and speed of the automobiles moving through the area. Instead, the staff report, at page 5, provides "Tals a condition of approval, the applicant will pay a fair-share contribution towards crosswalk improvements to the intersection." Such a mitigation measure is improper in the following respects (beyond those points made in our March 8, 2021 comment letter to the DAB): a. First, the imposition of this condition of approval shows the DAB, and city staff, recognize the intersection requires a crosswalk in light of the Project's addition of 49 households of new residents, and the additional pedestrian traffic expected from the Project's three retail spaces, directly accessing the Grossmont Shopping Center for shopping or parking purposes (the latter especially, in light of the Project's deficient parking space supply). This dangerous condition (i.e., no safe crosswalk, stop signs, or signals) will be heightened by the addition of dozens, if not hundreds, of additional individuals trying to cross Grossmont Boulevard on a daily basis - a clear and unmistakable impact requiring review and mitigation under CEQA. Yet, the DAB approved an exemption from CEQA review declaring that there is no reasonable possibility that a significant impact exists pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c). This determination does not comport with the facts, nor the City's determination that a condition on the Project is required to contribute towards the safety of this intersection. On this basis alone, the DAB's approval of a categorical exemption is without merit. b. Second, the DAB's approval of a fair-share contribution, on its face, indicates that the City expects other neighboring future developments to contribute to the correction of the unsafe conditions at the Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street intersection due to the foreseeable addition of more pedestrians and vehicles due to residential and commercial development in the area. This, too, indicates that the cumulative impact exception found at CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(b) ("All [categorical] exemptions... are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.") applies, such that the DAB could not lawfully approve a exemption to this Project. categorical CEQA

C. Third, the imposition of a mitigation measure, such as a condition requiring street improvement, or payment of a fair-share contribution toward such an improvement, inherently indicates that the Project is expected to result in a significant impact. In such an instance, no categorical CEQA exemption may be granted. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102.) Notwithstanding this, DAB chairman, and Community Development

PWM227

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Wiegelman, La Mesa City Clerk March 16, 2021
Page 3 of 6

Director, Kerry Kusiak's attempt to waive this legal impropriety by arguing that the $5,000 contribution to street improvements is feature of the Project rather than a condition imposed by the City runs counter to the plain language of the approval - the fair-share contribution is "a condition of approval" (staff report, page 5), and "[t]he applicant shall provide a fee in-lieu of $5,000 [sic] for construction of an ADA compliant curb ramp at the southeast corner of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street" (DAB Resolution No. DAB-2021-xx, at page 4, Engineering Condition of Approval #21).
Moreover, the argument that this $5,000 contribution is a feature of the Project offered by the Applicant, rather than a mitigation measure imposed by the City, is patently absurd. The Applicant repeatedly indicates, in its own words, when (improperly) seeking waivers under the State Density Bonus Law, that the Project would be financially infeasible due to "cost impacts" if it were to meet the City's development standards (see staff report, Attachment E, pages 2-5) - so, the Council would have to believe that the Applicant is claiming financial difficulty and simultaneously giving away cash to the City even though it was under no obligation to do so (and that there no Project impact to this intersection dictate the imposition of a mitigation measure). Such efforts to avoid CEQA must be avoided as an affront to the community this Council and its staff serve.
As further described in our March 8, 2021 (Exhibit"B"), this mitigation measure also runs afoul of the basic tenet of CEQA jurisprudence that payment into a fair-share fee is only permissible if the fees are "part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency commits itself to implementing." (Anderson First Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173, 1187.) There appears to be no such plan, commitment, nor funds to implement, the construction of a crosswalk across Grossmont Boulevard at Wilson Street, nor any indication
as to how the $5,000 condition of approval was determined to result in a "fair-share" of the overall
expense in light of the Project's impacts - this is, of course, because there has been no lawful
review of the Project's impacts at this intersection in direct violation of CEQA.
The City's Design Review Board, also on March 8, 2021, conditioned the Project's approval on the Applicant's provision of traffic analysis to prove that the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street was inherently dangerous requiring deviation from the City's standard public realm improvements in the Mixed Use ("MU") zone. This condition indicates that a the Applicant specifically seeks a waiver of required development standards due to a hazardous condition to health and safety at this intersection (i.e., by adding numerous new pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles). Whether the waiver is granted, or not, the fact remains that the City acknowledges the Project will generate impacts at this intersection requiring review and mitigation measures such that a categorical CEQA exemption may not be approved in light of CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c).

Making matters worse, Mr. Kusiak, also a Design Review Board member, declared that the traffic report required of the Project would not be prepared until the Applicant provided "construction drawings" for the development - such construction drawings are submitted when seeking building permits, well after the Project's discretionary entitlements have been considered and issued by the City. This, too, runs afoul of CEQA in that mitigation measures, and analyses, studies, and reports required to develop such measures in light of expected environmental impacts may not be deferred. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4(a)(1)(B).)
2) Throughout the DAB hearing, Mr. Kusiak incorrectly declared that the Project was a "by- right" development. A "by-right" development means the Project cannot be reviewed in a
discretionary manner but must instead by approved ministerially. This is incorrect and runs afoul of CEQA it in that it provides an inaccurate description of the Project likely to mislead the public, and other decisionmakers, as to their rights and the scope of analysis owed the Project under the
law.

The California Supreme Court recently opined on this very issue clarifying the difference between discretionary and ministerial projects:
A permit issuance decision can be discretionary or ministerial depending on the circumstances. Those terms are defined in the CEQA Guidelines. A project is discretionary when an agency is required to exercise judgment or deliberation in deciding whether to approve an activity. (CEQA Guidelines, con 15357.) It is distinguished from a ministerial project, for which the agency merely determines whether applicable statutes, ordinances, regulations, or other fixed standards have been satisfied. (Ibid.) Ministerial projects are those for which "the law requires [an] agency to act ... in a set way without allowing the agency to use its own judgment...." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15002, subd. (i)(1).) They involve "little or no personal judgment by the public official as to the wisdom or manner of carrying out the project. The public official merely applies the law to the facts as presented but uses no special discretion or judgment in reaching a decision."(CEQA Guidelines,
§ 15369.) [Protecting Our Water & Environmental Resources v. County of Stanislaus (2020) 10 Cal.5th 479, 489.]
On its face, the Project requires the approval of a Site Development Plan in light of its MU zoning. (DAB staff report, page 2 ["Entitlement review for new development in the MU zone involves site development plan review by the Development Advisory Board and design review by the Design Review Board, subject to City Council ratification."] The La Mesa Municipal Code, at section 24.02.034, further indicates that the review of a Site Development Plan is a discretionary process subject to approval, approval with conditions or denial, upon determining the project findings to be satisfactory and the City's design objectives are met, to ensure "that no detriment to

PWM229

Page 5 of 6

the public health, safety of welfare will result." Such a review specifically calls out the City's responsibility to use its judgment in deliberating whether to approve the Project's Site Development Plan.
Moreover, Mr. Kusiak's declaration that the Project is "by-right" does not comport with CEQA. CEQA specifically does not apply to ministerial projects. (Public Resources Code § 21080(b).) The very fact that the DAB sought to approve an exemption from CEQA pursuant to Guideline section 15332 indicates that the Project is discretionary in that a CEQA exemption is a not applicable to ministerial projects.
CEQA is intended to provide the public, and decisionmakers, with accurate information
about the nature and full scope of a development. (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal. App. 3d 185, 192.) Providing inaccurate information, misleading the public, and other decisionmakers, as to their rights to review and analyze the Project is a disservice to the community and discourages thoughtful discussion necessary to shape a discretionary development review. (Id. [an "accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an informative and legally sufficient" review under CEQA.].) The inaccurate description of the Project must be corrected to comply with CEQA.
Similarly, Mr. Kusiak stated that the DAB had no authority to deny the Project's requested waiver under the State Density Bonus Law due to health and safety concerns (raised, largely, with respect to the dangerous traffic-related conditions at the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street). This, too, is an incorrect statement of the law and the scope of the City's authority to review the Project under CEQA. As indicated in our March 8, 2021 letter to the DAB. Government Code section 65915(e)(1) specifically provides that waivers of development standards under the State Density Bonus Law should not be granted when they would result in "specific, adverse impact... upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate of avoid the specific adverse impact." Though the DAB (and the DRB), as well as the City staff report, acknowledge that the Project's waivers result in specific, adverse impacts upon health, safety, and the physical environment without offer of satisfactory mitigation, due to the claimed exemption from CEQA, with respect to public realm improvements (resulting in hazardous traffic conditions), parking space size and drive aisle standards (resulting in hazardous traffic and parking conditions), open space standards, landscaping standards, and other deviations from development standards, these waivers were approved due to an inaccurate statement of the law - claiming that the DAB could not deny the waivers under circumstances where specific, adverse impacts to health and safety are expressly acknowledged to exist. In light of this, the Project's waivers must be reconsidered and its impacts on the environment reviewed to determine what mitigation measures may be imposed.
Further, in light of the rampant inaccuracies, misstatements of law, and impropriety of appointing City staff (i.e., the Community Development Director, City Engineer, Building Division Director, and Fire Marshal) to review staff recommendations, and afford discretionary

PWM230

approval of projects, we strongly recommend the City reconsider its current practices. It does not appear that the composition of the DAB, nor the Design Review Board, afford any semblance of an impartial determination on matters of great importance to the public. Rather, these bodies appear to act as "rubber-stamps" on staff decisions. At the very least, the Council should consider having municipal attorney staff each such meeting to protect the City's interests, and those of
the community.

Re: Project No. 2020-16 (CityMark Communities LLC) - 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, CA

Dear Ms. Kinnard:
This law firm represents the St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California located at
5150 Wilson Street, directly adjacent to the La Mesa Woman's Club ("LMWC), the site of a 49 residential unit and three commercial unit mixed-use project ("Project") proposed by CityMark Communities LLC (*CityMark") known as Project No. 2020-16. This correspondence is offered to inform the City of La Mesa ("City") of our client's grave concerns regarding the proposed Project, the limited conditions recommended to ensure the health and safety of the public, and the apparent lack of analysis of the Project's expected impacts.
We also wish to bring to the City's attention that on December 17, 2020 this firm requested to be placed on the notice list for all public hearings relating to the Project, and specifically those relating to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Notwithstanding this, we were only sent notice of the March 8. 2021, 12:30 p.m. Design Review Board ("DRB") meeting after regular work hours, at 8:10 p.m., on Thursday, March 4, 2021 (see Attachment "1"), indicating that the City requires audio/visual presentations by the public to be submitted by "12:00 noon, one business day prior to the start of the meeting.' It would be practically impossible to prepare and transmit any presentation, let alone a thoughtful one, within three regular working hours of receipt of said notice (i.e., after 9 a.m. on March 5, 2021) to comply with the City's stated deadline. What is more, 10 notice was sent to this office of the March 8, 2021, 10 a.m. Development Advisory Board ("DAB") meeting though we understand that an exemption to CEQA analysis is to be voted on in this hearing. In fact, it is solely due to our client's diligence in searching the City's website, at approximately 11:15 am on March 5, 2021, that we learned of the DAB meeting at all - again, making it impossible to provide the City with an audio/visual presentation by the 12:00 noon
deadline set for that same day.
We understand that COVID-19 has altered the conditions by which we all live and work, and that the City is permitted to avoid direct communications from the public during such hearings

PWM235

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard

in light of California Executive Order N-29-20. Yet, the failure to afford the public a practical opportunity to review, analyze, and respond to the Project's 137-page DRB staff report and the 150-page DAB staff report does not comport with the public's statutory and constitutional rights to petition its government under the Ralph M. Brown Act. (Government Code 54950 et seq.; Cal. Const., Art. I§ 3, subd. (a) and (b)(1), (7).) These actions run afoul of the law as they present limitations on public participation which are simply "too arbitrary and capricious, too restrictive and unreasonable." (Nevens V. Chino (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 775, 778; see also Robins v. Pruneyard Shopping Center (1979) 23 Cal.3d 899, 907 [The right of the people to petition the government for redress of grievances is "vital to a basic process in the state's constitutional scheme."].)
Furthermore, should CityMark, or its consultants, be permitted to present audio/visual materials to, or communicate directly with, the DAB or DRB boards during these hearings on March 8, 2021 it will only heighten the inequities inherent in providing late, or no, notice to the public, with regard to the respective rights of the parties to petition their government. This would be an unfortunate, and likely unlawful, action in unequal treatment under both state and federal statutes and constitutions. A more reasoned action would be to postpone each of the DAB and DRB hearings by a week, or more, to permit each party, and the public more generally, an opportunity to present their positions thoughtfully.
Notwithstanding this, we a offer a limited summary of our client's position with respect to the proposed Project in the hopes that it will be presented to the DAB and DRB board members for review prior to any discussion of, or determination on, this matter. In light of the severely constrained time available to us before the DAB and DRB meetings, we will not reiterate each of the points made in prior communications and correspondence delivered to the City in opposition to the Project but join in those comments by this reference. Rather, we will focus briefly on the inadequate analysis of the Project in light of the City's General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, the Project's inapt use of California State Density Bonus Law (Gov. Code § 65915 et seq.) waivers, and the impropriety of the claimed CEQA exemption under Guidelines section 15332.

I. The Project Runs Afoul Of The General Plan's Urban Design Element And The Zoning Ordinance

As the staff reports to each of the DAB and DRB indicate, the Project site is designated as "Mixed Use Urban," corresponding to the Mixed Use (MU) Overlay, in the Residential Business base zone and is intended to support "pedestrian friendly housing.' (DAB Staff Report, p. 2; DRB Staff Report, p.2.) Notwithstanding this, the Project seeks to avoid the very features it is obligated to provide to enable pedestrian-friendly housing.

The Project sits under 100 feet away, directly across Grossmont Boulevard, from the
Grossmont Shopping Center. The closest supermarket to the Project is the Walmart Neighborhood Market therein, lying approximately 350 feet away, yet because there is no crosswalk, stop sign, and/or traffic signal at the intersection of Wilson Street and Grossmont Boulevard, a resident of the Project would be required to walk about three-quarters of a mile to safely cross the street, pick up groceries, and return with them - it is doubtful many residents will be able to lug an average family's weekly groceries this distance, on foot. (DAB Staff Report, p. 2 [In fact, the City recognizes this failing at the beginning of its report, "The intersection is not signalized and is lacking curb ramps and crosswalks."]; see also DRB Staff Report at p. 2 for the same acknowledgment of a dangerous condition].) Notwithstanding this, it appears it the Project is being permitted to avoid the development of : crosswalk which is absolutely necessary for its residents or, at least, providing an analysis showing the Project will generate significantly more average daily vehicular trips and vehicle miles traveled than contemplated.
The City failed to require a traffic analysis for the Project, though it initially sought to
require an ADA-compliant ramp be constructed at this intersection before apparently dropping this condition altogether. Our client's environmental consultant has also indicated this intersection is
particularly dangerous because of limited sightlines arising from a substantial curve in Grossmont Boulevard in this area. The observation that this particular intersection is dangerous has been
voiced numerous times in correspondence submitted to the City by multiple parties. Yet the staff reports show that no ramp, crosswalk, or analysis was required of the Project - instead, the Project is conditioned to provide a $5,000 "fair-share" payment toward a ramp to be built by an unknown party at an unknown time in the future. This does not comport with the law.
There appears to be no plan on file to develop a safe intersection at Grossmont Boulevard
and Wilson Street, and the $5,000 payment does not appear to go towards any previously approved is fund for that purpose. Nor is there any indication of how this figure was calculated. In Anderson First Coalition V. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173, the appellate court held that paying a "fair-share fee" is permissible as effective mitigation only if the fees are "part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency commits itself to implementing." That is not the case in this instance. In light of this, the City must require the installation of an appropriately signalized intersection, or some other traffic calming feature here, or require the Project to present an analysis indicating why it should not do so. The only evidence in the administrative record, to date, on this topic shows that the City initially desired a crosswalk to be
installed but backed off without explanation (or analysis available to the public, or the City's
decisionmakers).

"In MU areas, new development is required to include pedestrian realm improvements along collector streets to encourage pedestrian activity. The Circulation Element classifies Grossmont Boulevard as major collector street subject to pedestrian realm requirements."(DAB

La Mesa City Council

City of La Mesa
8130 Allison Avenue
La Mesa, CA 91942

Subject: Brown Act Demand for Cure and Correction Regarding Development Advisory Board

Honorable Mayor Arapostathis and City Council:
This demand is made on behalf of this firm's client, St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California ("SLLC"). All further communications regarding this matter should be directed to this
office.

On March 8. 2021 at 10 am (PST), the City of La Mesa ("City") Development Advisory
Board ("DAB") held a public hearing with respect to the prospective development of the La Mesa Woman's Club property at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California 91942 (the "Project"), and its claimed exemption from the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Leading up to, and during the course of, that DAB hearing the City ran afoul of the Ralph M. Brown Act (Government Code sections 54950 et seq.; the "Brown Act") which requires the public be afforded various rights to be heard, and to hear, about matters of public concern such as the Project. These rights were violated, and this situation must be rectified by the City Council.

We present this correspondence in the hopes that the City Council will take this opportunity
to cure or otherwise correct these Brown Act violations so that no further action need be taken by
the SLLC to resolve these issues.

Violations of the Brown Act

1. The Brown Act, at Government Code section 54954.3(a), requires public agencies
provide:

...an opportunity for members of the public to directly address the
legislative body on any item of interest to the public, before or during the

PWM595

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Honorable Mayor Arapostathis and City Council
April 7, 2021
Page 2 of 5

legislative body's consideration of the item, that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the legislative body.... (Emphasis added.)
On December 17, 2020, this firm specifically requested to be notified of all Project and CEQA-related hearings. The City, through its City Clerk, acknowledged receipt of the request on December 28, 2020. (Exhibit "A".) Notwithstanding this, we never received notice of the March 8, 2021 DAB hearing from the City. Rather, our client fortuitously notified us of the DAB hearing on March 5, 2021 at approximately 11:15 am. Making matters worse, the DAB staff report indicated that any audio/visual presentation to be made by the public would need to be submitted by 12:00 pm on that same day - March 5, 2021. (Exhibit "B".)
As it is impossible to put together such a presentation, and to submit it to the City, in the span of 45 minutes, SLLC was not able to present its position, in full, during the course of the DAB's consideration of the Project. This is violative of Government Code section 54954.3(a) in that the City failed to afford this firm, and the public generally, an opportunity to directly address the DAB as required.

We strongly suggest the City Council correct this by ordering the DAB hold a new hearing
on the Project and that the public be afforded proper notice of this new hearing.

2. The Brown Act does not permit the City to limit public participation in a manner that is "too arbitrary and capricious, too restrictive and unreasonable." Nevens v. Chino (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 775, 778; see also Robins V. Pruneyard Shopping Center (1979) 23 Cal.3d 899, 907 [The right of the people to petition the government for redress of grievances is "vital to a basic process in the state's constitutional scheme."]; Cal. Const., Art. I, § 3(a), (b)(1), and (b)(7).
Yet, this is precisely what the City did in foisting a 150-page DAB staff report, without notice, on the public. It followed this violative action by then restricting the public's ability to participate in the March 8, 2021 hearing - the staff report indicated that public comments had to be delivered solely via email by 8:00 am on March 8, 2021, so that only the first 300 words of any such comment would be placed into the record before the DAB. Of the public comments that were read, the majority indicated they had insufficient time to review the staff report, and/or that they were elderly and without access to email (requiring the assistance of family members', with limited time and resources of their own, to register their position with respect to the Project). This, notwithstanding the fact, that each of the DAB board members, the City staff, and Project applicant spoke freely, and without limitation in fact, the DAB chair continued the Project's hearing repeatedly to permit one of the applicant's consultants an opportunity to appear resulting in the closure of the hearing almost two hours after it started. Yet, not a single member of the public was permitted to speak, or to present anything more than 300 words.

PWM596

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Honorable Mayor Arapostathis and City Council
April 7, 2021
Page 3 of 5

In light of the egregious nature of the City's handling of the public comment portion of the hearing, which can only be considered arbitrary, capricious, restrictive, and unreasonable in light of the opportunities afforded to the Project applicant, we strongly recommend the City Council correct this violation of the Brown Act by ordering a new DAB hearing affording the public a right
to be heard.

3. The Brown Act prohibits serial meetings - that is, a majority of the decision making members may not "use a series of communications of any kind, directly or through intermediaries, to discuss, deliberate, or take action on any item of business outside of the public meeting.
Government Code § 54952.2(b). Yet, this is precisely what happened (and likely happens with respect to all DAB matters) in that each of the board members of that body are City staff members
(Community Development Director Kerry Kusiak, City Engineer Leon Firsht, Building Division Director Aaron Sturm, and Fire Marshal Steve Swaney), all of whom by necessity of their
respective positions specifically interacted with one another, either serially or in groups, to determine what impacts, requirements, conditions, and features the Project has, or should have.
Such discussions of the Project, and the DAB's ultimate outcome, run afoul of the Brown Act and cannot conceivably be corrected without the replacement of each of the board members with individuals other than City staff members. We suggest the City Council disband the DAB and appoint new board members whose positions do not require that they review, discuss, and otherwise weigh in on development projects which go before the DAB to avoid such conflicts going forward. We further suggest that in light of these circumstances, the DAB's approval of the
Project, and its prospective CEQA exemption, be rescinded until such time as a new DAB board
is empaneled.

Further, we note what appears to be a misconception on the part of the DAB chair, Mr.
Kusiak. Throughout the DAB meeting, Mr. Kusiak claimed that this was "not a public hearing"
but was instead a "posted board meeting" which "did not require public noticing.' This is incorrect.
Government Code section 54952(b) provides that the provisions of the Brown Act cover "legislative bodies" which include each:
...commission, committee, board, or other body of a local agency, whether permanent or temporary, decision making or advisory, created by charter, ordinance, resolution, or
formal action of a legislative body....

The DAB is such a "legislative body" for the purposes of the Brown Act in that it is a permanent board, created by the City through by ordinance and/or formal action. See, for instance, La Mesa Municipal Code ("LMMC') § 24.02.010 [specifying the responsibility of the DAB to review development proposals and specifically indicating it is subordinate to the City Council pursuant to Ord. 2600 §§ 2-6 formulated April 28, 1992); LMMC § 24.02.035 [requiring site

PWM597

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Honorable Mayor Arapostathis and City Council
April 7, 2021
Page 4 of 5

development plan approval by the DAB]; LMMC § 2.66.110 [requiring the DAB to meet with
respect to certain development projects pursuant to Ordinance 2457, July 14, 1987]; and LMMC
§ 24.02.037 (Ord. 97-2686 § 2 formulated November 25, 1997); LMMC § 22.04.010 (Ord. 2315
formulated May 26, 1983); LMMC § 18.18.060 (Ord. 2358 formulated June 21, 1984); LMMC § 22.03.010 (Ord. 2006-2774 § formulated November 28, 2006); and co. LMMC § 22.02.010 (Ord. 2307; March 24, 1983.) In short, there is little question that the DAB is subject to the Brown Act.

A meeting is defined by the Brown Act as "any congregation by a majority" of the
legislative body at the same time and place to "hear, discuss, or deliberate" on any matter within the jurisdiction of the body. The Brown Act, Open Meetings For Local Legislative Bodies, Office of the Attorney General, 2003, at p. 8. Because all of the DAB board members congregated together, albeit by remote video conference, to hear, discuss and deliberate on the Project's site
development plan and CEQA exemption, the requirement for a public meeting under the Brown Act is met. In light of these facts, the DAB's March 8, 2021 hearing on the Project was, and is, a public hearing subject to all of the requirements of the Brown Act, contrary to Mr. Kusiak's
assertions.

We strongly recommend the City Council direct the City Attorney, or other legal counsel, properly train the DAB board members, and the City staff more generally, on the requirements of the Brown Act to avoid such confusion and any further violations in the future.

CONCLUSION

Given the above points, SLLC demands the City Council:

(1) Acknowledge the violations described above and make a commitment not to act in a
similar manner in the future;
(2) Afford the public a reasonable opportunity to communicate with the DAB prior to, and during, all future public hearings of the board; (3) Revise the constituents of the DAB board to comport with the Brown Act; (4) Revise the LMMC with respect to the DAB board to comport with the Brown Act; and (5) Rescind any and all actions taken during the March 8, 2021 DAB hearing on the Project pending further rehearing by the reconstituted DAB.

The City Council must notify this office of its decision to cure and correct as demanded no
later than 5 p.m. on Friday, May 7, 2021.

Should the City Council fail, or refuse to perform as demanded, this will serve as evidence
of an actual and present disagreement over the public's rights and the City's responsibilities under the Brown Act and may lead my client to consider legal action as authorized by the Brown Act. It

the SLLC's sincere desire this action not be required and that the City Council take up the interests of the public, and its mandated duties under the Brown Act, without delay.

Glenn,

Sorry I was unable to pick up the phone when you called today. I have some litigation and mediation deadlines to meet
this week, so likely will not be able to talk today or tomorrow.

I understand that the La Mesa City Council has not made a determination as to whether it will cure and/or correct the
deviations from the Brown Act specified in our April 7, 2021 correspondence - please correct me if some action has
been taken, as I have received no notice of such action. My calendar shows that tomorrow, May 7, 2021, represents the
last day upon which such a determination may be made, starting the 15-day clock for my client to file a petition for writ
of mandate to seek the court's direction. As I will be out of town when this deadline runs, will be forced to file by April
21, 2021. I further understand from your voicemail, that you believe there may be some solution to this, or perhaps some other issues raised by St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California in its appeal of the Development Advisory
Board's March 8, 2021 approval of the development proposal, and CEQA exemption thereto, at 5220 Wilson Street, La
Mesa, CA 91942.

My client welcomes workable resolutions to its claims, so I would ask that you get back to me by email with sufficient time to avoid litigation - there is, unfortunately, not much time to do so in light of the short deadlines imposed under
the Brown Act - so that I can quickly pass your suggestions along.

Re: April 7, 2021 Correspondence-Brown Act Demand for Cure and Correction Regarding Development Advisory Board

Dear Mr. Tinkov:

This correspondence addresses your correspondence as referenced above. Please note that numerous discussions have transpired among City staff over the years regarding the elimination of the Development Advisory Board (DAB) for various reasons. Your
correspondence has prompted City staff to begin the appropriate process for ellmination (please see the attached emails between Kerry Kusiak, Director of Planning and Community Development and Greg Humora, City Manager). Furthermore, at my direction, new development applications in the future will not be subject to DAB review.
believe this action should suffice to remedy any allegations of Brown Act violations that you have asserted.

Also, because of the issues raised in your correspondence, if so requested by your Client, City staff would be happy to "redo" the March 8, 2021 DAB hearing on the development project planned at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California.

Please contact me with any questions, concerns or requests. Thank you and have a pleasant a vacation,

After discussions with the City Attorney, we both agree that your suggestions regarding the DAB should be implemented, Therefore, in conjunction with the City Attorney's office (after consultation with the Mayor), I will be

Subject: Development Advisory Board

Greg,
As we have discussed, the appellant's attorney in the Wilson Street project (2020-16) has also challenged the validity of
the makeup of the Development Advlsory Board (DA8) under the Brown Act. The challenge centers on the contention that the staff that make up the DAB (Director of Community Development, Director of Public Works, Building Öfficial,
and Fire Marshall) have serial meetings in violation of the Act. The attorney notes that the staff on the board necessarlly
interact outside of public meetings to perform the function of project review.
In this regard, think the attorney may be on point. To remedy this situation, suggest that the DAB be eliminated as
soon as possible and replaced with an administrative review process under the authority of the Community
Development Director. The process could include some level of public review period of projects prior to a decision being
made, with the possibility of appeal. Since the DAB was established by ordinance, an ordinance would be needed to amend the Zoning Code to remove the DAB and Insert the administrative process. If you are In agreement with this
approach, we could have staff report ready to introduce the concept to the City Council and receive authorization to
procced as carly as the Council meeting scheduled for May 25, 2021.

Further, I would suggest that no new applications received going forward should be heard by the DAB. With that in
mind, we would proceed immediately with an amendment once authorized to establish a new process as quickly as
possible so as not to delay the project review process.

Cc: Jessica Mackey
Subject: RE: St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California

Good afternoon Glenn,

I hope this message finds you well.

First, I must note an error in my message of May 6, 2021 below - had mistakenly indicated that I would be required to
file a petition by April 21, 2021 which, of course, would be impossible. I had intended to say that because of previously
planned travel, I would have to file by May 21, 2021.

With that out of the way, I have reviewed your letter and while I appreciate what appears to be an earnest desire on the part of Mr. Humora and Mr. Kusiak to eliminate the Development Advisory Board, this response to St. Luke's April 7, 2021 Brown Act Demand for Cure and Correction is legally deficient. The Brown Act requires that the legislative body
(i.e., the City Council) review the asserted violations in such a demand and to take action. (See, for instance,
Government Code Section 54960.1(c)(2) ["Within 30 days of receipt of the demand, the legislative body shall cure or
correct the challenged action and inform the demanding party in writing of its actions to cure or correct or inform the
demanding party in writing of its decision not to cure or correct the challenged action."].)

Though Mr. Humora is the City Manager, and Mr. Kusiak is the Director of Planning and Community Development, I am
not aware of any statutory or caselaw which would indicate they have the authority to respond to a demand of this
nature in compliance with the Act. Of course, if you have some legal basis to believe otherwise, I look forward to
reviewing the material. Failing this, and in light of what I understand to be inaction on the part of the City Council with
respect to my client's allegations of improprieties under the Brown Act, St. Luke's is forced to proceed as indicated previously (and corrected above).

Sincerely,
Felix Tinkov

Re: May 11, 2021 Correspondence-Brown Act Demand for Cure and Correction Regarding Development Advisory Board

Dear Mr. Tinkov:

This correspondence addresses your correspondence referenced above. Perhaps further information will alay your Client's concerns regarding Brown Act Violations by the Development
Advisory Board (DAB). First, a draft ordinance eliminating the DAB is scheduled for consideration by the La Mesa City Council on May 25, 2021 (agenda available on May 21, 2021) ("Ordinance"). Staff and the City Attorney's office will be recommending adoption. In La Mesa, the Mayor and the City Manager set the Council agenda. My strong anticipation is that the Ordinance will be adopted. In that event, obviously, the City will seek to dismiss any Brown Act lawsuit filed regarding the DAB and refuse any request related for Attorneys' fees.
Furthermore, as mentioned in my earlier correspondence, at the City Attorney's directive, no new development applications will be considered by the DAB pending the final outcome related to the Ordinance.

Thank you for your consideration and I hope this information has been helpful.

16 INTRODUCTION

17 This action seeks relief from the failure of Respondents CITY OF LA MESA ("CITY"),
18 CITY OF LA MESA CITY COUNCIL ("COUNCIL"), and CITY OF LA MESA DEVELOPMENT
19 ADVISORY BOARD ("DAB") to perform as required by the Ralph M. Brown Act ("Brown Act";
20 Gov. Code § 54950 et seq.). Petitioner ST. LUKE'S LUTHERAN CHURCH, LA MESA,
21 CALIFORNIA ("ST. LUKE'S') seeks a writ of mandate, injunctive and declaratory relief under the
22 Brown Act, the California Constitution at Article I, Sec. 3, the La Mesa Municipal Code, and the
23 California Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP") §§ 1085 and 1060. ST. LUKE'S alleges as follows:

24 THE PARTIES

25 1. At all relevant times mentioned herein, Petitioner ST. LUKE'S, is a California non-

26 stock corporation operating as a religious institution at 5150 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California. ST.
27 LUKE'S congregation is comprised of members of the public and interested persons directly affected
28 by the decisions made by Respondents CITY, COUNCIL, and DAB as to community concerns and

related matters of land use in the vicinity of ST. LUKE'S.

2. ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that at all relevant times
3 mentioned herein, Respondent DAB is, and was, a "legislative body" as defined in Gov. Code
4 54952. Accordingly, ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that at all relevant
times mentioned herein, the DAB is, and was, required to comply with all provisions contained in the
6 Brown Act.

3. ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that at all relevant times
8 mentioned herein, Respondent CITY COUNCIL is, and was, a "legislative body" as defined in Gov.
9 Code § 54952. Accordingly, ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that at all
10 relevant times mentioned herein, the CITY COUNCIL is, and was, required to comply with all
11 provisions contained in the Brown Act.

12 4. ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that at all relevant times
13 mentioned herein, Respondent CITY is, and was, a "local agency" as defined in Gov. Code § 54951.
14 Accordingly, ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that at all relevant times
15 mentioned herein, the CITY is, and was, required to comply with all provisions contained in the
16 Brown Act.

17 5. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, associate, or otherwise,
18 of those Respondents sued as DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, are unknown to ST. LUKE'S and,
19 therefore, ST. LUKE'S sues them under fictitious names. ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and
20 thereon alleges, that at all relevant times mentioned herein, DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, are in
21 some manner or capacity, and to some degree, responsible and liable for damages and/or acts of
22 which ST. LUKE'S petitions this Court. When the true names and capacities of DOES 1 through 10,
23 inclusive, are determined and ascertained, ST. LUKE'S will seek leave of court to amend this
24 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate to state the true names and capacities of such fictionally named
25 DOE Respondents. On information and belief, ST. LUKE'S makes all allegations contained in this
26 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate against all Respondents, including DOES 1 through 10,
27 inclusive.

28 6. ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that at all relevant times

mentioned herein, each of the defendants was the agent of the others, and, in committing the acts
2 alleged, were acting with the scope of their authority as agents, employees, or authorized
3 representatives, and with the permission and/or consent of the other Respondents.

4 JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND STANDING

5 7. San Diego County Superior Court has initial jurisdiction over the matters alleged
6 herein pursuant to CCP § 1085, 1094.5, 1094.6, and 1095-1097; Civil Code § 3420, and Gov. Code
7 §§ 54960 and 54960.1.

9 the actions (and inactions) complained of occurred in the County of San Diego, State of California.

10 9. ST. LUKE'S has standing to assert the claims raised in this Verified Petition for Writ l
11 of Mandate pursuant to Civil Code § 1086, and Gov. Code §8 54960 and 54960.1. ST. LUKE'S, and
12 its congregation, have a stake in this matter and are affected by the decisions made by the
13 Respondents as explained below. ST. LUKE'S has a substantial, direct, and immediate interest in
14 assuring that Respondents fulfill their duties to comply with the Brown Act in making decisions
15 which affect La Mesa residents, and more specifically, ST. LUKE'S itself. ST. LUKE'S will suffer
16 significant loss if Respondents' actions (and inactions) in violation of the Brown Act are permitted to
17 stand.

18 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS COMMON TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION

19 10. ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that on Monday, March 8,
20 2021, starting at approximately 10 am (PST), the DAB held a public hearing ("Hearing") with
21 a respect to a proposed development (the "Project") of the property located at 5220 Wilson Street, La|
22 Mesa, California - which site is directly adjacent to ST. LUKE'S church. This public hearing was

23 open to the public only through a remote video conference (no in-person attendance was permitted
24 due to COVID-19 restrictions enforced by the CITY), and the public's, though not the Project
25 applicant's, or its consultants', input was limited to the CITY staff reading aloud up to the first three
26 hundred (300) words of comments submitted by members of the public.
27 11. Prior to this, on December 17, 2020, ST. LUKE'S, through its undersigned counsel,
28 requested, via email, the CITY notify him of all public hearings relating to the Project and any
3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM621

California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"; California Public Resources Code 21000 et seq.)

2 matters thereto. On December 28, 2020, the City Clerk of the CITY acknowledged receipt of said
3 request by replying to the undersigned's email. A true and correct copy of this request for notice and
4 the CITY's reply is attached hereto, and incorporated herein, as Exhibit "A".

12. Notwithstanding said request for notice, the CITY provided no such notice as to its
6 Monday, March 8, 2021 Hearing. Instead, ST. LUKE'S learned of the Hearing at approximately
7 [1:15 am (PST) on Friday, March 5, 2021 upon perusing a CITY website on which a copy of the

8 notice was published. Said notice indicated that the CITY would permit two categories of speech to
be made to the DAB, those by members of the public whose comments "must be submitted to
10 planning@cityoflamesa.us..and be no more than 300 words" and those of development project
11 "[a]pplicants who wish to make an audio/visual presentation pertaining to an item on the agenda,'
12 with no explicit limitation on length. A true and correct copy of this DAB notice for the Hearing is
13 attached hereto, and incorporated herein. as Exhibit "B"

14 13. ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, the CITY provides several
15 weeks of notice leading up to the Hearing to the Project applicant.

16 14. ST. LUKE'S was not given sufficient notice to properly review and comment on the
17 CITY's analysis of the Project (available at

18 (https://www.cityoflamesa.us/DocumentCenter/View/17152/DAB-2021-03-08), approximately one

19 hundred fifty six (156) pages in length, prior to said Hearing, in light of the CITY's failure to provide
20 sufficient and proper notice.

21 15. A 15-page comment letter, on behalf of ST. LUKE'S, was submitted to the DAB at
22 approximately 9:45 a.m. on March 8, 2021. Only the first three hundred (300) words of the comment
23 letter were read into the record by the CITY. The comment letter did not appear in the materials
24 presented to the DAB, nor was it made available to the public or the DAB for the Hearing. A true
25 and correct copy of ST. LUKE'S March 8, 2021 comment letter is attached hereto, and incorporated
26 herein, as Exhibit "C".

27 16. ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, the CITY read aloud the
28 first three hundred (300) words of comments on the Project from approximately twenty (20)
4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM622

members but did not permit (or offer any opportunity for) ST. LUKE'S or the public to speak
2 directly to the DAB during the Hearing, though the Project applicant, and its several of its
3 consultants, conferred with the DAB for well over the span of an hour. The DAB took action
4 pursuant to Gov. Code 8 54952.6 in approving the Project and finding the Project exempt from
5 CEQA review.

17. Since the Hearing, ST. LUKE'S has been informed and believes, and thereon alleges,
7 the DAB members are senior CITY department officials, including Community Development
8 Director Kerry Kusiak, City Engineer Leon Firsht, Building Division Director Aaron Sturm, and Fire
9 Marshal Steve Swaney, and that some or all of these DAB members met with one another, at times
10 serially and/or through intermediaries, to discuss the Project as to whether it should be approved, and
11 upon what conditions, if any, prior to the start of the Hearing.

12 18. On or about March 17, 2021, ST. LUKE'S submitted its timely appeal (*Appeal") of
13 the DAB's determination on the Project and its CEQA exemption to the CITY COUNCIL pursuant
14 to La Mesa Municipal Code ("LMMC") § 24.02.035. To date, the CITY COUNCIL has not set a
15 hearing for the Appeal, nor has the CITY communicated with ST. LUKE'S in any manner on this
16| issue other than to acknowledge receipt of the Appeal. A true and correct copy of the Appeal and the
17 communications with the CITY regarding said Appeal are attached hereto, and incorporated herein,
18 as Exhibit "D".

19 19. On or about April 7, 2021, ST. LUKE'S delivered to the CITY COUNCIL, through
20 the CITY CLERK, a demand to cure and correct alleged violations of the Brown Act ("Demand") as
21 to: (1) the DAB's Hearing's limitations on public participation, (2) the CITY's failure to provide

22 proper notice of the Hearing, (3) the DAB members' improper communications regarding the Project
23 prior to the Hearing, and (4) more generally, the DAB members' improper communications as to all
24| other applications before that legislative body. A true and correct of the Demand is attached hereto,
25 and incorporated herein, as Exhibit "E".

26 20. On or about May 4, 2021 and May 5, 2021, the La Mesa City Attorney, Glenn Sabine,
27 communicated, via telephone call and voicemails, with ST. LUKE'S counsel a desire to resolve the
28| issues raised in the Demand, but offered no specific indication of what resolution was intended.
5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM623

21. On or about May 6, 2021, ST. LUKE'S counsel directed an email to City
Attorney Sabine requesting further information about the CITY's proposed resolution to the
Demand and indicating that little time remained before ST. LUKE would be forced to file this
4 litigation. A true and correct copy of said email correspondence is attached hereto, and incorporated
5 herein, as Exhibit "F".

6 22. On or about May 7, 2021, City Attorney Sabine transmitted to ST. LUKE'S counsel
letter indicating a claimed desire on the part of City staff to eliminate the DAB "for various reasons,"

8 that the Demand had "prompted City staff to begin the appropriate process for elimination" of the
9 DAB, that City Attorney Sabine had directed that "new development applications in the future will
10 not be subject to DAB review," and offering a "redo'* of the Hearing regarding the Project. A true
11 and correct copy of this letter is attached hereto, and incorporated herein, as Exhibit "G".
12 23. On or about May 11, 2021, ST. LUKE'S responded to City Attorney Sabine, via
13 email, indicating the insufficiency of the CITY's response to the Demand in light of the Brown Act
14 requirement that a legislative body, not the CITY staff, cure or correct the challenged actions and
15 inform ST. LUKE'S, in writing, within thirty (30) days of the Demand of the scope the actions taken
16 to cure. A true and correct copy of this email correspondence to City Attorney Sabine is attached
17 hereto, and incorporated herein, as Exhibit "H".

18 24. On or about May 13, 2021, City Attorney Sabine, via email, transmitted to ST.
19 LUKE'S counsel a letter, in a Microsoft Word format, indicating that "a draft ordinance eliminating
20 the DAB is scheduled for consideration by the La Mesa City Council on May 25, 2021 (agenda
21 available on May 21, 2021)," stating his "strong anticipation... that the Ordinance will be adopted,'
22 and that he had issued a directive that "no new development applications will be considered by the
23 DAB pending the final outcome related to the Ordinance" along with an incomplete portion of the
24 second page which appears to contain a portion of the May 7, 2021 correspondence. A true and
25 correct copy of this Microsoft Word document is attached hereto, and incorporated herein, as Exhibit
26 "I.

27 25. ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that, contrary to the claims
28 made by the La Mesa City Attorney, the DAB continued to review development projects after May
6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM624

7, 2021, and continues to review development projects at the time of this filing, as indicated by the
2 CITY's legislative calendar reflecting DAB hearings on May 10, 2021 and May 24, 2021, and the
3 agendas available for each of those public meetings
4 (https://www.cityoflamesa.us/DocumentCenter/View/17342/DAB-Packet-2021-05-10-Final and

5 https://www.cityoflamesa.us/DocumentCenter/View/17386/DAB-Packet-2021-05-24-Final,
6 respectively). A true and correct copy of the CITY's May 2021 legislative calendar is attached
7 hereto as Exhibit "J".

8 26. ST. LUKE'S is further informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the CITY
9 COUNCIL had not taken up the Demand within thirty (30) days of its transmittal nor proffered a
10 writing in response to the Demand indicating whether it would act to cure or correct any or all of the
11 alleged violations of the Brown Act made therein.

12 27. ST. LUKE'S is further informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the CITY
13 COUNCIL will consider the dissolution of the DAB at its May 25, 2021 public meeting, but that said
14 consideration is not to include contemplation, or further direction, the CITY COUNCIL with respect
15 to the points raised in the Demand, including but not limited to the DAB's March 8, 2021 approval
16 of the Project and its CEQA exemption, as well as the validity of the DAB's determinations as to
17| other projects reviewed by the DAB both before and after the Project, and the alleged failures to
18 provide proper notice and to permit public participation as required under the Brown Act. A true and
19 correct copy of the City Manager's Report to the CITY COUNCIL for the May 25, 2021 public
20| meeting (Agenda Item #9) is attached hereto, and incorporated herein, as Exhibit "K".

21 28. Having exhausted all available administrative remedies, having been offered no
22 writing from the CITY COUNCIL indicating its intent to cure the alleged Brown Act violations set
23 forth in the Demand, and being informed and believing, and thereon alleging that the DAB continues
24 to act in violation of the Brown Act, compounding violative actions it has taken in the past and not
25 yet addressed, ST. LUKE'S now seeks redress because the Respondents' failure to provide legally
26 sufficient remedy demonstrates that such actions will continue unless this Court intervenes.

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 29. ST. LUKE'S realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 28 above,
3 as though set forth herein in their entirety.

4 30. The Hearing was "a regular meeting" under the Brown Act requiring notice pursuant
5 to Gov. § Code § 54954.

6 31. ST. LUKE'S requested the CITY to provide notice of all public hearings relating to
7 the Project, pursuant to Gov. Code § 54954.1, and all related CEQA matters, pursuant to 14 Cal.
8 § Code Regs. § 15087 ("CEQA Guidelines" § 15087(a).) §

32. Because the Project is sited directly adjacent to ST. LUKE'S church, the CITY was
10 also required to provide ST. LUKE'S with notice of the Project's CEQA hearing before the DAB
11 pursuant to CEQA Guideline § 15087(a)(3).

12 33. Though the CITY informed the Project applicant of the date and time of the Hearing
13 weeks in advance of its March 8, 2021 date, the CITY failed to provide timely notice to ST. LUKE'S
14 church of the Hearing.

15 34. This lack of notice limited ST. LUKE'S, and the public's, participation in the Hearing
16 and mislead these parties about the Project which the CITY knew to be known to be of great concern
17 to the neighboring community.

18 35. ST.LUKE'S was prejudiced by these noticing violations under the Brown Act and the
19 Cal. Const., Art. I, :02 3, because it was left with insufficient time to conduct an investigation into the
20 Project and the CITY's analysis of the Project as well as the associated CEQA exemption and was,
21 therefore, unable to fully participate in the Hearing.

22 36. In addition to the above-described violations, the DAB also committed the following
23 additional violations of the Brown Act and the California Constitution:

24 a. Though the DAB had the technical ability and time to afford the Project applicant,
25 and its consultants, unlimited and direct communications during the Hearing, it
26 limited ST. LUKE'S, and the public's, ability to petition their government by only
27 permitting the first three hundred (300) words of their comments to be read into

28 the record with respect to the Project and its CEQA exemption claims in violation
8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM626

of Government Code § 54954.3. ST. LUKE'S was prejudiced by the DAB's
unreasonable and unnecessary limitation on its inability to communicate its 2

3 concerns regarding the Project during the Hearing. On the same date as the

4 Hearing, as well as before and after this, the DAB has repeatedly limited the
ur a public's ability to petition their government in favor of project applicants, but
without any legal or technical basis to do so; and
A00 b. Because the DAB consists solely of senior CITY department officials that had
previously reviewed, and extensively discussed (concurrently amongst
themselves, serially, and/or through their respective subordinates who would later
10 report to them) the Project, its CEQA exemption claims, and the conditions they

11 intended to place on the Project, the Hearing was little more than a sham

12 perpetrated on the remotely viewing, but silenced, public. On the same date as the

13 Hearing, as well as before and after this, the DAB's members reviewed and

14 unlawfully discussed other projects the DAB was required to review and vote

15 upon in public hearings pursuant to the Brown Act and the California Constitution

16 at Article I, Section 3.

17 37. ST. LUKE'S timely objected to the above-described violations of the Brown Act and
18 the California Constitution, through the Demand, and pursuant to Gov Code §§ 54960, 54960.1 and
19 54960.2 sought cure or corrective action.

20 38. The CITY COUNCIL failed to timely take up the Demand and further failed to timely
21 prepare and transmit to ST. LUKE'S an unconditional commitment, in writing, that it would cure or
22 correct each and every one of the violations raised in the Demand as to the Project, its CEQA
23 exemption, and all other projects reviewed prior to, or after, the Hearing - in fact, the CITY

24 COUNCIL failed to make any such unconditional commitment and now appears to desire to absolve
25 itself in a manner contrary to that required under the Brown Act.
26 39. ST. LUKE'S has a clear, present, and beneficial interest in Respondents' compliance
27 with the Brown Act, and the California Constitution, Art. I, § 3.

40. Respondents have a clear, present, and mandatory duty to comply with all 28

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM627

1 requirements of the Brown Act, and the California Constitution, Art. I, § 3.

2 41. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between ST. LUKE'S and the
3 Respondents concerning the Respondents' actions under the Brown Act and the California
4 Constitution, Art. I, § 3.

42. ST. LUKE'S now believes that Respondents' actions violate the Brown Act and the
6 California Constitution, Art. I, § 3, while Respondents contend to the contrary.

7 43. A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time.

8 44. Respondents have abused, and will continue to abuse, their discretion by violation of
9 the Brown Act and the California Constitution, Art. I, § 3, unless enjoined.

10 45. ST. LUKE'S is likely to prevail on the merits and establish that Respondents violated
11 the Brown Act and the California Constitution, Art. I, § 3.

12 46. ST. LUKE'S has no adequate or speedy remedy at law for the conduct of the
13 Respondents described herein. Writ, declaratory, and injunctive relief offer the only means to ensure
14 Respondents will act in accord with the law.

15 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

16 47. ST. LUKE'S realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 42 above,
17 as though set forth herein in their entirety.

18 48. ST. LUKE'S timely filed, and paid for, its Appeal of the DAB determination with
19 respect to the Project and its exemption from CEQA review.

20 49. Pursuant to LMMC § 22.04.010, the CITY was required to hear the Appeal within
21 thirty (30) days of its filing but did perform its mandated duty.

22 50. ST. LUKE'S has a clear, present, and beneficial interest in Respondents' compliance
23 with the LMMC.

24 51. Respondents have a clear, present, and mandatory duty to comply with the LMMC.

25 52. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between ST. LUKE'S and the
26 Respondents concerning the Respondents' actions under the LMMC.

27 53. ST. LUKE'S now believes that Respondents' actions violate the LMMC, while
28 Respondents contend to the contrary.
10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM628

54. A judicial declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time.

55. Respondents have abused, and will continue to abuse, their discretion by violation of
the LMMC, unless enjoined.

56. ST. LUKE'S is likely to prevail on the merits and establish that Respondents violated

the LMMC.

57. ST. LUKE'S has no adequate or speedy remedy at law for the conduct of the
Respondents described herein. Writ, declaratory, and injunctive relief offer the only means to ensure
8 Respondents will act in accord with the law.

10 WHEREFORE, PETITIONER PRAYS AS FOLLOWS:

11 1. That this Court issue writ ordering that:

12 a. Respondent DAB perform as required by the Brown Act and/or the California
13 Constitution at Art. I. 3 with respect to (i) the provision of proper public notice
‡0 for, (ii) the provision of reasonable public participation at, and/or (iii) the
discussion, deliberation, and/or taking of action on items of business only within,
16 public meetings;
17 b. Respondent DAB, CITY, and/or CITY COUNCIL rescind, set aside, annul, and/or
18 void the DAB's approval of the Project and the Project's exemption from CEQA;

19 and

20 c. Respondent CITY and/or CITY COUNCIL process the Appeal in accord with the

21 LMMC.

22 2. That this Court issue declarations that:

23 a. Respondent DAB is a legislative body subject to the Brown Act;
24 b. Respondent DAB violated the Brown Act;

25 C. Respondent CITY and/or CITY COUNCIL violated the LMMC;

26 d. Respondent CITY and CITY COUNCIL, may not cure or correct Brown Act

27 violations solely through the actions of its City Manager, Community

28 Development Director, and/or City Attorney; and
II

2 e. The DAB's approval of the Project and/or its exemption from CEQA is null and

3 3. That this Court issue permanently enjoin:

5 a. Respondent DAB from withholding proper public notice for public meetings;

6 b. Respondent DAB from withholding the public's reasonable participation at public
meetings;

7
00 c. Respondent DAB's members from communication, on matters of the DAB'S
business, outside of noticed, public meetings; and

10 d. Respondent DAB's March 8, 2021 determination as to the Project and the
Project's exemption under CEQA.

11 4. That ST. LUKE'S recover attorney's fees incurred in this action
12 Code § 54960:5 and CCP 8 1021.5. pursuant to Gov.

13 5. For an award of costs incurred in this action; and

Re: Project No. 2020-16 (CityMark Communities LLC) - 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, CA

Dear Ms. Kinnard:

This law firm represents the St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California located at
5150 Wilson Street, directly adjacent to the La Mesa Woman's Club ("LMWC"), the site of a 49 residential unit and three commercial unit mixed-use project ("Project") proposed by CityMark Communities LLC ("CityMark") known as Project No. 2020-16. This correspondence is offered
to inform the City of La Mesa ("City") of our client's grave concerns regarding the proposed
Project, the limited conditions recommended to ensure the health and safety of the public, and the apparent lack of analysis of the Project's expected impacts.
We also wish to bring to the City's attention that on December 17, 2020 this firm requested
to be placed on the notice list for all public hearings relating to the Project, and specifically those relating to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Notwithstanding this, we were only sent notice of the March 8, 2021, 12:30 p.m. Design Review Board ("DRB") meeting after
regular work hours, at 8:10 p.m., on Thursday, March 4, 2021 (see Attachment "1"), indicating that the City requires audio/visual presentations by the public to be submitted by "12:00 noon, one business day prior to the start of the meeting.' It would be practically impossible to prepare and transmit any presentation, let alone a thoughtful one, within three regular working hours of receipt of said notice (i.e., after 9 a.m. on March 5, 2021) to comply with the City's stated deadline. What is more, no notice was sent to this office of the March 8, 2021, 10 a.m. Development Advisory Board ("DAB") meeting though we understand that an exemption to CEQA analysis is to be voted
on in this hearing. In fact, it is solely due to our client's diligence in searching the City's website, at approximately 11:15 am on March 5, 2021, that we learned of the DAB meeting at all - again, making it impossible to provide the City with an audio/visual presentation by the 12:00 noon deadline set for that same day.
We understand that COVID-19 has altered the conditions by which we all live and work, and that the City is permitted to avoid direct communications from the public during such hearings

in light of California Executive Order N-29-20. Yet, the failure to afford the public a practical opportunity to review, analyze, and respond to the Project's 137-page DRB staff report and the 150-page DAB staff report does not comport with the public's statutory and constitutional rights to petition its government under the Ralph M. Brown Act. (Government Code 54950 et seq.; Cal. Const., Art. I§ 3, subd, (a) and (b)(1), (7).) These actions run afoul of the law as they present limitations on public participation which are simply "too arbitrary and capricious, too restrictive and unreasonable." (Nevens v. Chino (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 775, 778; see also Robins V. Pruneyard Shopping Center (1979) 23 Cal.3d 899, 907 [The right of the people to petition the government for redress of grievances a is "vital to a basic process in the state's constitutional scheme."].)
Furthermore, should CityMark, or its consultants, be permitted to present audio/visual materials to, or communicate directly with, the DAB or DRB boards during these hearings on March 8, 2021 it will only heighten the inequities inherent in providing late, or no. notice to the
public, with regard to the respective rights of the parties to petition their government. This would be an unfortunate, and likely unlawful, action in unequal treatment under both state and federal statutes and constitutions. A more reasoned action would be to postpone each of the DAB and DRB hearings by a week, or more, to permit each party, and the public more generally, an opportunity to present their positions thoughtfully.
Notwithstanding this, we offer a limited summary of our client's position with respect to the proposed Project in the hopes that it will be presented to the DAB and DRB board members for review prior to any discussion of, or determination on, this matter. In light of the severely constrained time available to us before the DAB and DRB meetings, we will not reiterate each of the points made in prior communications and correspondence delivered to the City in opposition to the Project but join in those comments by this reference. Rather, we will focus briefly on the inadequate analysis of the Project in light of the City's General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, the Project's inapt use of California State Density Bonus Law (Gov. Code § 65915 et seq.) waivers, and the impropriety of the claimed CEQA exemption under Guidelines section 15332.

T. The Project Runs Afoul Of The General Plan's Urban Design Element And The Zoning Ordinance
As the staff reports to each of the DAB and DRB indicate, the Project site is designated as "Mixed Use Urban," corresponding to the Mixed Use (MU) Overlay, in the Residential Business base zone and is intended to support "pedestrian friendly housing." (DAB Staff Report, p. 2; DRB Staff Report, p.2.) Notwithstanding this, the Project seeks to avoid the very features it is obligated to provide to enable pedestrian-friendly housing.

The Project sits under 100 feet away, directly across Grossmont Boulevard, from the Grossmont Shopping Center. The closest supermarket to the Project is the Walmart Neighborhood Market therein, lying approximately 350 feet away, yet because there is no crosswalk, stop sign, and/or traffic signal at the intersection of Wilson Street and Grossmont Boulevard, a resident of the Project would be required to walk about three-quarters of a mile to safely cross the street, pick up groceries, and return with them - it is doubtful many residents will be able to lug an average family's weekly groceries this distance, on foot. (DAB Staff Report, p. 2 [In fact, the City recognizes this failing at the beginning of its report, "The intersection is not signalized and iS lacking curb ramps and crosswalks."]; see also DRB Staff Report at p. 2 for the same
acknowledgment of a dangerous condition].) Notwithstanding this, it appears the Project is being permitted to avoid the development of a crosswalk which is absolutely necessary for its residents or, at least, providing an analysis showing the Project will generate significantly more average daily vehicular trips and vehicle miles traveled than contemplated.
The City a failed to require a traffic analysis for the Project, though it initially sought to require an ADA-compliant ramp be constructed at this intersection before apparently dropping this condition altogether. Our client's environmental consultant has also indicated this intersection is particularly dangerous because of limited sightlines arising from a substantial curve in Grossmont Boulevard in this area. The observation that this particular intersection is dangerous has been voiced numerous times in correspondence submitted to the City by multiple parties. Yet the staff reports show that no ramp, crosswalk, or analysis was required of the Project - instead, the Project is conditioned to provide a $5,000 "fair-share" payment toward a ramp to be built by an unknown party at an unknown time in the future. This does not comport with the law.
There appears to be no plan on file to develop a safe intersection at Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street, and the $5,000 payment does not appear to go towards any previously approved fund for that purpose. Nor is there any indication of how this figure was calculated. In Anderson First Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173, the appellate court held that paying a "fair-share fee" is permissible as effective mitigation only if the fees are "part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency commits itself to implementing." That is not the case in this instance. In light of this, the City must require the installation of an appropriately signalized intersection, or some other traffic calming feature here, or require the Project to present an analysis indicating why it should not do so. The only evidence in the administrative record, to date, on this topic shows that the City initially desired a crosswalk to be installed but backed off without explanation (or analysis available to the public, or the City's
decisionmakers).
"In MU areas, new development is required to include pedestrian realm improvements along collector streets to encourage pedestrian activity. The Circulation Element classifies Grossmont Boulevard as a major collector street subject to pedestrian realm requirements." (DAB Staff Report, p. 2; DRB Staff Report, p. 2. [Emphasis added.]; see also La Mesa Municipal Code

PWM647

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard

§ 24.18.040(B).) The condition to pay a fee in lieu of an actual mitigation measure regarding a known project impact runs afoul of CEQA and should not be permitted. Rather the Project must be required to perform an analysis to determine the scope of the impact and to then propose a mitigation measure to reduce that impact to a less than significant level.
Moreover, this mitigation measure is improper on two other bases. First, it improperly attempts to defer mitigation until a later (and, in this case, unknown future) time. This is specifically forbidden under CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4 (a)(1)(B).) And second, a mitigation measure is only available if a project under CEQA is expected to generate a potentially significant impact on the environment, but the staff report indicates is that the Project is exempt from CEQA because there are no such expected impacts. (DAB Staff Report, p. 7-8; see also DAB Staff Report, Attachment A, "Resolution No. DAB-2021-xx" at Par. 1.) So, either the Project is not exempt from CEQA and cannot be conditioned to mitigate a potentially significant impact, or it must be analyzed properly under CEQA (i.e., by preparation of an Initial Study, followed by specific impact category studies, and the development of a mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report). The status quo does not comport with the law. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102 [a public agency may not adopt mitigation measures a for a project for the purpose of qualifying it for a categorical CEQA exemption; see also Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1200.)
A. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Limited To Overcoming Physical, Not Financial, Constraints Such That Avoiding Improvements To The Pedestrian Realm Are Not Permitted For This Project
As indicated above, the Project is designated Mixed Use Urban requiring improvements to the surrounding pedestrian realm. LMMC § 24.18.020(E) defines the term "pedestrian realm" as follows:

"Pedestrian realm" means a twelve-foot wide area located between the face of the curb of a Circulation Element designated street and the face of the building. The pedestrian realm includes the parkway, sidewalk, and landscaped areas. The pedestrian realm may include both public and private property where the public right-of-way is not twelve feet wide. Pedestrian amenities, street trees, street furniture, bus stop facilities, and other landscaping, as specified in this chapter, shall be included in the public realm.
Notwithstanding this acknowledged requirement, "[w]aivers are being requested to allow reductions in... pedestrian realm requirements." (DAB Staff Report, p. 3; DRB Staff Report, p. 3.) For instance, the Project seeks a "waiver" under the State Density Bonus Law so that it may encroach four feet into the pedestrian realm along Grossmont Boulevard by installing balconies hanging over this right of way. This miscomprehends what a waiver is under the law.

PWM648

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
March 8, 2021
Page 5 of 13

Pursuant to Government Code $65915(e)(1), waivers (as opposed to incentives) are
afforded a to a density bonus project only when a "development standard will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development," not because the developer desires it, or because it will enhance the financial prospects of a project. Put another way, a waiver permits
deviation from, or altogether evasion of, regulations which affect project due to its site-specific physical features. This subject site has no such physical constraints. Rather, the balconies could be built outside of the pedestrian realm (i.e., within the building envelope) by moving the exterior
walls along Grossmont Boulevard back four feet, or removed altogether. The applicant itself
makes clear that it is not a physical constraint that drives this waiver request when it states its
justification as follows:
This waiver is requested due to excessive space and cost impacts to incorporate the Open Space requirement and private balconies. The loss of development potential to incorporate this would make the project infeasible to provide the affordable units.
As mentioned above, the site itself does not have any physical obstruction which precludes
construction of these balconies, rather CityMark simply desires to have them overhang the pedestrian realm because it would increase their financial incentive to develop the Project. The State Density Bonus Law permits this sort of deviation from regulation for financial gain through the use of incentives, of which the Project has two (waivers, on the other hand, are unlimited for such developments). Yet, the Project avoids using any of its incentives and instead improperly requests at least five waivers to avoid its open space requirements, building height limit, parking space sizing, landscaping required within the pedestrian realm, and overall parking requirements. In each such instance, CityMark indicates that the justification for the waiver is not a physical constraint unique to the site but rather the request is made to seek a financial boon for the
developer.

The reason the Project seeks to use waivers rather than incentives is clear on its face - the State Density Bonus Law does not authorize a sufficient number of incentives (i.e., the Project
requires five, but only has two available to it) to meet CityMark's desired financial goals, whereas it may request an unlimited number of waivers. Because it does not have sufficient incentives to develop the Project in this manner, it attempts to avoid their use altogether and instead make faulty justifications for waivers which are impermissible under the law.

Because CityMark cannot show a physical constraint exists which limits the development
of the Project under the City's laws and policies, it must use its incentives (and justify the use of those incentives by showing the financial benefit gained thereby) and/or redesign the Project to be in conformity with the law.

B. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Not Permitted To Pertain To Health And Safety Overcome Regulations That

As mentioned above, the Project's requests for waivers are inapposite to the law because they pertain to financial rather than physical constraints. In addition, the Project improperly seeks to waive the City's standard parking space and driving aisle dimensions even though this would result in direct health and safety impacts. Waivers are impermissible on this basis as well.

The dimensions of parking spaces and adjacent driving aisles are specified to ensure the safety of vehicles, their drivers and passengers, and pedestrians. (LMMC § 22.112.010(B).) This makes common sense • if spaces and driving aisles are too small, or otherwise constrained, they are likelier to lead to physical harm from other vehicles when vacating or entering a space and are the reason why State building codes requires minimum parking dimensions to ensure health and safety. (DAB Staff Report, p. 3 & Attachment D, pp. 3-4; DRB Staff Report, p. 3 & Attachment E, pp. 3-4.)
Government Code section 65915(e)(1) of the State Density Bonus Law provides:
Nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted to require a local government to waive or reduce development standards if the waiver or reduction would have a specific, adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5, upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact. [Emphasis added.]

Thus, a waiver cannot be used to avoid the specific, adverse impact arising from the reduction of a basic safety feature inherent in parking stall/space sizes and driving aisle dimensions as contemplated by the Project due to the health and safety issues it raises. No justification exists which would be sufficient to overcome this requested reduction in health and safety standards, nor would an incentive permit such a thing.
C. The Project, As Designed, Is Contrary To The Chief Land Use Policies Declared Under The Land Use And Urban Design Element Of The General Plan
California law requires each city and county to adopt a general plan, a comprehensive long- term plan for the development of that city or county, famously referred to by the state Supreme Court as the "constitution for future development." (Lesher Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 540.) A general plan must contain seven mandatory "elements," including a "land use element" to designate the level of intensity and general distribution of land uses. (Gov. Code § 65302.) "[T]he propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development depends upon [a finding of] consistency with the applicable general plan and its

PWM650

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard

Page 7 of 13

elements." (Resource Defense Fund v. County of Santa Cruz (1982) 133 Cal.App.3rd 800, 806.) CEQA imposes an obligation on La Mesa to assess the Project's consistency with the City's
General Plan. (North Coast Rivers Alliance et al. v. Marin Municipal Water District (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 614, 633.) The Project, as designed and proposed, cannot be found to be consistent with the Land Use and Urban Design Element of the City's General Plan.
By way of example:

1) Policy LU-1.2.2 requires that "[a]s part of the development review process, City departments will review all future development to ensure that safety requirements are met,
including building and fire codes, accessibility standards and crime prevention techniques. Yet, as indicated above, the City's failure to ensure that the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street indicates that no such review has been performed (or that, if it has, the requirement to ensure safety has been obviated) such that a dangerous condition not only is permitted to exist, but it is being worsened by increasing the vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the area while also
attempting to authorize a large development where a single-story structure currently exists, further reducing sight lines on a dangerous curve in the road. Similarly, the proposed waivers to reduce parking space dimensions and drive aisle widths do not "ensure that safety requirements are met, including building and fire codes, [nor] accessibility standards."
2) Policy LU-2.1.2 requires the City to "[s]upport infill development and subdivision
proposals that reinforce neighborhood strengths and benefit neighborhood identity," yet the Project proposes a development which is so different in character and intensity from any other in the neighborhood, both with respect to its architectural style and the materials used on its exterior walls - none of which can be found elsewhere in this community. Thus, it cannot be said that this Project will "reinforce" the existing visual appeal of the community.
3) Policy LU-2.1.5 requires the implementation of projects in the "Mixed-Use Overlay
Zone by promoting the rehabilitation of properties and new development that fits into the context
of the existing neighborhoods while meeting the City's Urban Design Objectives for infill development." Again, as noted directly above, in #2, the Project is completely out of character and context with respect to the existing neighborhood such that this policy cannot be met,
4) Policy LU-4.2.3 requires that "[n]ew development shall provide adequate parking." As the Project specifically seeks to not only reduce parking space numbers below the City's normal standards, it also seeks to reduce the number below those permitted under the State Density Bonus Law (albeit, improperly attempting to do SO via a waiver, as indicated in the immediately preceding two sections of this letter). Also, as indicated in the immediately preceding section, the Project does not provide adequate parking not only with respect to the reduced number of spaces it proposes, but also improperly attempts to reduce the dimensions of the spaces and the drive aisles around them in a manner likely to impact the public's (and future residents') health
and safety. Thus, the Project clearly conflicts with this policy as well.
5) Objective UD-1.1 requires the City's "[t]o protect La Mesa's existing built
environment and cultural heritage." But the Project proposes to destroy the LMWC clubhouse

PWM651

which has been in place for over half a century and, thus, conflicts directly and inarguably with this policy.
6) Objective UD-3.1 requires that development be "architecturally and environmentally sensitive and ...compatible with neighboring design and scale." As indicated in the discussions regarding Policy LU-1.2.2 and Policy LU-2.1.2 directly above, the Project is unlike anything in this neighborhood, especially with respect to its design and scale, and therefore, conflicts with this objective of the General Plan.
In short, the Project cannot be said to be in harmony with the City's General Plan Land Use and Urban Design Element as proposed. As such, it must be revised significantly to come into conformance with the General Plan, and the surrounding community.

II. The Project Fails To Comply With The California Environmental Quality Act
The primary purposes of CEQA are to inform City decisionmakers, as well as the public, about the potential impacts of a project, a and to prescribe mitigation measures to avoid such impacts. CEQA requires a broad view of what constitutes a project requiring environmental analysis. (McQueen v. Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1143.) Even projects that appear benign will likely fall within the ambit of CEQA. (Bloom v. McGurk (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1307, 1312.) The California State Legislature formulated CEQA to "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of the environment shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions." (Pub. Res. Code §21001(d).) To implement this goal, CEQA requires municipalities to analyze discretionary projects for potential environmental impacts utilizing a three-tier system. (No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 74.) The first tier is known as a preliminary review. The preliminary review requires public agency staff to analyze a complete application in order to discern the full scope of the project at issue. (CEQA Guidelines section 15060(b); City of Pasadena v. The State of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 810, 836.) Once the parameters of the project are established, a determination is made to resolve whether an exemption is applicable to the project. If such an exemption is found, the agency must determine that no exceptions to the exemption are triggered by the potential impacts from the full scope of the project. (CEQA Guidelines §§ 15060, 15061.) If the project is not exempt from CEQA, or an exception is applicable, the second tier of review is required wherein an initial study is prepared because it has been determined that there is a possibility that the project may have a significant effect on the environment. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063.) An initial study facilitates environmental assessment early in the design of a project. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063(c).) In the third tier, the initial study is used to demonstrate that either: a) the project "will not have a significant effect," triggering the preparation of a negative declaration, or b) the project is one "which may have a significant effect on the environment," triggering the preparation of an environmental impact report ("EIR"). (CEQA Guidelines § 15064.)

PWM652

While the Guidelines provide opportunities for projects to be exempted from CEQA review, these exemptions are limited in nature. "Only those projects having no significant effect on the environment are categorically exempt from CEQA review." (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network, supra, at p. 1102.) A significant effect is a "substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in the environment." (Pub. Res. Code $21068. [Emphasis added.])
This means that an activity has a significant effect if, among other things, it "has the potential to
degrade the quality of the environment." (Pub. Res. Code § 21083.) "TA]n activity that may have
a significant effect on the environment cannot be categorically exempt." (Mountain Lion
Foundation v. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 124. [Emphasis added.])

The courts review categorical exemptions using strict construction in a manner affording the greatest environmental protection within the reasonable scope of the statutory language. (County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 966.) "[E]xemption categories are not to be expanded or broadened beyond the reasonable scope of their statutory language." (Dehne V. County of Santa Clara (1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 827, 842.) Thus, an exemption must be applicable in light of the full scope of a project.
A public agency has the burden of proving that substantial evidence supports its factual finding that project falls within the asserted exemption. (Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose, 54 Cal. App. 4th 106, 114-115 (1997); Magan v. County of Kings (2002) 105 Cal.App.4th 468, 475.) "An agency's duty to provide such factual support 'is all the more important where the record shows ...that opponents of the project have raised arguments regarding possible significant environmental impacts."" (Muzzy Ranch Co. v. Solano County Airport Land Use Com. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 372, 386.) A city cannot impose a burden on the public to prove a possibility of adverse environmental impacts since this would frustrate CEQA's fundamental purpose of ensuring that government officials "make decisions with environmental consequences in mind." (Davidon Homes, supra, at p. 116; California Farm Bureau Federation v. California Wildlife Conservation
Bd. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 186.) "[T]he agency's exemption determination must be supported by evidence in the record demonstrating that the agency considered  possible environmental impacts in reaching its decision." (Davidon Homes, supra, at p. 117; East Peninsula Ed. Council, Inc. v. Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School Dist. (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 155, 171.)
The record before the City, limited as it is because of the lack of analysis performed by CityMark, reveals that the Project's potential effects on the environment make the application of
a categorical exemption legally inappropriate. In fact, most of the environmental analysis performed, to date, has been by the church's experts and those analysis have not been challenged, nor apparently analyzed by the City.

A. The City May Not Apply The In-Fill Development Exemption In Light Of The Project's Expected, and Known, Potentially Significant Impacts
The City proposes to avoid CEQA review of the Project by employing the In-Fill Development exemption found at CEQA Guidelines section 15332. This exemption provides that in-fill development may avoid CEQA analysis if:
(a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations.
(b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more
than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses. (c) The project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species.
(d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality. (e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.
Our client has secured all Project materials the City purports to have in its possession or control via the California Public Records Act ("CPRA"). In securing this data, it has become readily obvious that very little analysis of the Project's potentially significant impacts to the environment have been performed to date. In fact, the only data in the administrative record analyzing the Project under CEQA has been provided by our client's environmental experts. These analyses, and the records produced pursuant to the above-mentioned CPRA request, indicate that though CityMark submitted an "Environmental Assessment/Initial Study Application" the City has performed no analysis of its own and has no Initial Study to indicate whether further environmental review must occur. Moreover, the expert analyses provided by our client, concretely and definitively specifies potentially significant impacts in the following CEQA categories:

(1) Air quality impacts arising from construction. This is especially important in that the Project proposes significant grading - "400 cubic yards of excavation (cut) and 1,400 cubic yards of fill... primarily used to raise the rear of the site to establish a pad for the parking area [along with].... [a] retaining wall of up to eight and a half feet in height is planned along the south end of the parking area" - which is directly adjacent to the area where 125 students currently attend the Warren Walker School, on the church campus. These students are sensitive receptors, spending time outdoors to learn and play, and with open windows, especially during the COVID-19 era, to provide additional ventilation limiting discase spread. (2) Noise impact arising from construction. Again, much like the air impacts category, directly above, but likely to last significantly longer as the construction noise will exist

PWM654

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
March 8, 2021
Page 11 of 13

throughout the site's development both before (during demolition) and long past (during construction) the grading operations. The noise from all of this construction
will flow unimpeded into the directly adjacent school and playground disrupting
hundreds of children's' education for what is likely to be a period of one to two years. (3) Hazardous materials disposal during construction. The LMWC building was constructed prior to the elimination of asbestos-containing materials, lead-based paints,
and polychlorinated biphenyls, yet no analysis has been made of these hazards (or
methods to mitigate these potential hazards) upon adjacent residents, churchgoers,
senior living facility residents, and/or schoolchildren.
(4) Hydrology and water quality impacts from the developed Project. The church's experts
have analyzed the existing site, and the proposed Project at build-out, and determined
that the Project's drainage study inaccurately describes the conditions such that
considerably more stormwater is expected to flow onto the church property than
reported. (5) Transportation impacts from construction and the developed Project. These impacts include significant numbers of heavy-haul •trucks going through Wilson Street
(designated a local collector) interrupting regular traffic and parking along the road, as
well as church and school pick-ups and drop-offs, and a failure to follow the current standard in traffic analysis under CEQA, namely a vehicle miles traveled (VMT) analysis pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15064.3. And as indicated above, the
analysis indicates the dangers inherent in the intersection at Grossmont Boulevard and
Wilson Street.

But for the Project's hydrology and water quality analyses, the church's expert analyses on the remaining impact categories described above remain the only information in the administrative
record such that the City cannot simply overlook the described potentially significant impacts.
Neither the Project applicant, nor the City itself, have made any attempt to respond to these expert analyses such that CEQA requires that an initial study be prepared. (Hansen Brothers Enterprises, Inc. V. Board of Supervisors (1996) 12 Cal.4th 533, 560 [standing for the proposition that undisputed evidence in the administrative record must be relied upon.].) Until such time as the Project applicant, or the City, rebut the evidence presented by the church's experts, and with respect to certain issues, the testimony, and opinions of laypersons, those remain the only materials
upon which the City may rely in determining whether the exemption to CEQA under Guidelines
section 15332 may be effective.
Under CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c), "[a] categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect
on the environment due to unusual circumstances." Such an exception to CEQA Guidelines section 15332 exists in the administrative record in light of church's undisputed expert testimony as to impact categories described above. The City may not ignore evidence of an unusual circumstance creating a reasonable possibility of a significant a environmental impact. (Committee to Save the

PWM655

Hollywoodland Specific Plan v City of Los Angeles (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1187; McQueen v Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1148; Lewis v Seventeenth District Agricultural Association (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 823, 211.)
In light of these facts, the City cannot use a categorical exemption to avoid further analysis of the Project and must proceed to prepare an initial study followed by the preparation of a mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report permitting the public and the City's decisionmakers a thoughtful and reasoned opportunity to examine the totality of the Project and its potential impacts.

III. Conclusion

The City has failed to provide the public with a substantive opportunity to participate in a public forum regarding this Project in light of the inadequate (and with respect to the DAB, non- existent) notice, along with the practical impossibility of petitioning the government with a fulsome expression of the public's interests and grievances with regard to the development. The sharply limited deadlines needlessly imposed on the public do not comport with the law.
Further, the Project does not comply with the City's General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, the State Density Bonus Law, nor CEQA. In all, this Project must be sent back for significant further revisions and review.

We further note that the church is now engaged in a quiet title action with the LMWC,' before the superior court, over the church's driveway to resolve the ownership, possession, and control of this area. Should the court determine that the church is the title owner of the land, the Project's total size will be sharply a reduced resulting in a significant reduction in its base density, as well as any density bonus which may be afforded to it under the current proposal. Moreover, the Project seeks to install a tall retaining wall along this driveway, which will not be permissible upon the church securing explicit title in this land. And, the Project plans show that the church's driveway is being improperly shown as a fire truck access road during times of emergency though it does not offer access to the Project site given the steep slope separating the properties. In light of this, we strongly recommend the City hold back any decision which may result in confusing these issues or bringing the City into the action unnecessarily.

We note the DRB and DAB Staff Reports both inaccurately claim that the Project site at 5220 Wilson Street is owned by CityMark. It is, in fact, owned solely by the LMWC according to the church's latest information.

Re: Appeal of March 8, 2021 Development Advisory Board Determination Regarding Project No. 2020-16

Dear Ms. Wiegelman:
This correspondence shall serve as a request to appeal the March 8, 2021 City of La Mesa ("City") Development Advisory Board ("DAB") approval of the CityMark Communities LLC (*Applicant") development project, and exemption from the California Environmental Quality Act (*CEQA"), at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California, also "Project'). known as Project No. 2020-16 (the

Appeal of DAB Determination
Pursuant to La Mesa Municipal Code sections 2.08.051 and 24.02.035, this firm, acting on behalf of its client, St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California ("St. Luke's") located at 5150 Wilson Street, hereby timely appeals the DAB's March 8, 2021 approval of the Project and its exemption from review under CEQA, and attaches a check in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) (a copy of which is presented with the electronic version of the correspondence as Exhibit "A"). As the neighboring property owner representing the interests of its congregation as well as the community at large, St. Luke's files this appeal in light of specific violations of CEQA, the La Mesa Municipal Code, including but not limited to the Project's zoning requirements and concomitant development standards, the California State Density Bonus Law (Government Code § 65915 et seq.), and the City's General Plan as iterated in the letter delivered to the DAB on
March 8, 2021 and attached hereto as Exhibit "B."

In addition, certain representations made at the subject DAB hearing indicate that the Project is further violative of the law. We lay several of these issues out below:
1) In expectation of the Project's residents accessing the Grossmont Shopping Center directly across Grossmont Boulevard, the City's staff report to the DAB, at page 2, acknowledges that the "intersection [of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street] is not signalized and is lacking curb

PWM662

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Wiegelman, La Mesa City Clerk
March 16, 2021
Page 2 of 6

ramps and crosswalks." The Applicant's traffic engineer, during the public comment portion of the DAB hearing, indicated that the Project would install a crosswalk across Grossmont Boulevard. Yet, an examination of the Project plans, as reflected in the staff report, indicates no such street improvements are offered, nor is the City's approval conditioned on the installation of a safe,
signalized crosswalk at this intersection • though it is well understood to be a dangerous location in light of the curvature of the street and speed of the automobiles moving through the area. Instead, the staff report, at page 5, provides "[a'ls a condition of approval, the applicant will pay a fair-share contribution towards crosswalk improvements to the intersection." Such a mitigation measure is
improper in the following respects (beyond those points made in our March 8, 2021 comment letter
to the DAB):
a. First, the imposition of this condition of approval shows the DAB, and city staff, recognize the intersection requires a crosswalk in light of the Project's addition of 49 households of new residents, and the additional pedestrian traffic expected from
the Project's three retail spaces, directly accessing the Grossmont Shopping Center for shopping or parking purposes (the latter especially, in light of the Project's deficient parking space supply). This dangerous condition (i.e., no safe crosswalk,
stop signs, or signals) will be heightened by the addition of dozens, if not hundreds,
of additional individuals trying to cross Grossmont Boulevard on a daily basis - a clear and unmistakable impact requiring review and mitigation under CEQA. Yet,
the DAB approved an exemption from CEQA review declaring that there is no
reasonable possibility that a significant impact exists pursuant to CEQA Guidelines
section 15300.2(c). This determination does not comport with the facts, nor the
City's determination that a condition on the Project is required to contribute
towards the safety of this intersection. On this basis alone, the DAB's approval of a categorical exemption is without merit.
b. Second, the DAB's approval of a fair-share contribution, on its face, indicates that the City expects other neighboring future developments to contribute to the
correction of the unsafe conditions at the Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street
intersection due to the foreseeable addition of more pedestrians and vehicles due to
residential and commercial development in the area. This, too, indicates that the cumulative impact exception found at CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(b) ("All
[categorical] exemptions... are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of
successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.") applies, such that the DAB could not lawfully approve a categorical CEQA exemption to this Project. c. Third, the imposition of a mitigation measure, such as a condition requiring a street improvement, or payment of a fair-share contribution toward such an improvement, inherently indicates that the Project is expected to result in a significant impact. In
such an instance, no categorical CEQA exemption may be granted. (Salmon
Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098,
1102.) Notwithstanding this, DAB chairman, and Community Development

PWM663

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV

Page 3 of 6

Director, Kerry Kusiak's attempt to waive this legal impropriety by arguing that the $5,000 contribution to street improvements is a feature of the Project rather than a condition imposed by the City runs counter to the plain language of the approval - the fair-share contribution is "a condition of approval" (staff report, page 5), and "[t]he applicant shall provide a fee in-lieu of $5,000 [sic] for construction of an ADA compliant curb ramp at the southeast corner of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street" (DAB Resolution No. DAB-2021-xx, at page 4, Engineering Condition of Approval #21).

Moreover, the argument that this $5,000 contribution is a feature of the Project offered by the Applicant, rather than a mitigation measure imposed by the City, is patently absurd. The Applicant repeatedly indicates, in its own words, when (improperly) seeking waivers under the State Density Bonus Law, that the Project would be financially infeasible due to "cost impacts" if it were to meet the City's development standards (see staff report, Attachment E, pages 2-5) --so, the Council would have to believe that the Applicant is claiming financial difficulty and simultaneously giving away cash to the City even though it was under no obligation to do so (and that there no Project impact to this intersection dictate the imposition of a mitigation measure). Such efforts to avoid CEQA must be avoided as an affront to the community this Council and its staff serve.
As further described in our March 8, 2021 (Exhibit "B"), this mitigation measure also runs afoul of the basic tenet of CEQA jurisprudence that payment into a fair-share fee is only permissible if the fees are "part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency commits itself to implementing.' (Anderson First Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173, 1187.) There appears to be no such plan, commitment, nor funds to implement, the construction of a crosswalk across Grossmont Boulevard at Wilson Street, nor any indication as to how the $5,000 condition of approval was determined to result in a "fair-share" of the overall expense in light of the Project's impacts - this is, of course, because there has been no lawful review of the Project's impacts at this intersection in direct violation of CEQA.
The City's Design Review Board, also on March 8, 2021, conditioned the Project's approval on the Applicant's provision of a traffic analysis to prove that the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street was inherently dangerous requiring deviation from the City's standard public realm improvements in the Mixed Use (*MU") zone. This condition a indicates that the Applicant specifically seeks a waiver of required development standards due to a hazardous condition to health and safety at this intersection (i.e., by adding numerous new pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles). Whether the waiver is granted, or not, the fact remains that the City acknowledges the Project will generate impacts at this intersection requiring review and mitigation measures such that a categorical CEQA exemption may not be approved in light of CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c).

PWM664

Making matters worse, Mr. Kusiak, also Design Review Board member, declared that the traffic report required of the Project would not be prepared until the Applicant provided "construction drawings" for the development - such construction drawings are submitted when seeking building permits, well after the Project's discretionary entitlements have been considered
and issued by the City. This, too, runs afoul of CEQA in that mitigation measures, and analyses,
studies, and reports required to develop such measures in light of expected environmental impacts
may not be deferred. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4(a)(1)(B).)
2) Throughout the DAB hearing, Mr. Kusiak incorrectly declared that the Project was a "by- right" development. A "by-right" development means the Project cannot be reviewed in a
discretionary manner but must instead by approved ministerially. This is incorrect and runs afoul
of CEQA in that it provides an inaccurate description of the Project likely to mislead the public,
and other decisionmakers, as to their rights and the scope of analysis owed the Project under the
law.

The California Supreme Court recently opined on this very issue clarifying the difference
between discretionary and ministerial projects:

A permit issuance decision can be discretionary or ministerial depending on the circumstances. Those terms are defined in the CEQA Guidelines. A
project is discretionary when an agency is required to exercise judgment or deliberation in deciding whether to approve an activity. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15357.) It is distinguished from a ministerial project, for which the agency merely determines whether applicable statutes, ordinances, regulations, or other fixed standards have been satisfied. (Ibid.) Ministerial projects are
those for which "the law requires [an] agency to act ... in a set way without allowing the agency to use its own judgment." (CEQA Guidelines, 15002, subd. (i)(1).) They involve "little or no personal judgment by the public official as to the wisdom or manner of carrying out the project. The public official merely applies the law to the facts as presented but uses no
special discretion or judgment in reaching a decision.' (CEQA Guidelines,
§ 15369.)
[Protecting Our Water & Environmental Resources v. County of Stanislaus
(2020) 10 Cal.5th 479, 489.]

On its face, the Project requires the approval of a Site Development Plan in light of its MU
zoning. (DAB staff report, page 2 ['"Entitlement review for new development in the MU zone involves site development plan review by the Development Advisory Board and design review by the Design Review Board, subject to City Council ratification."] The La Mesa Municipal Code, at section 24.02.034, further indicates that the review of a Site Development Plan is a discretionary
process subject to approval, approval with conditions or denial, upon determining the project
findings to be satisfactory and the City's design objectives are met, to ensure "that no detriment to

the public health, safety of welfare will result." Such a review specifically calls out the City's responsibility to use its judgment in deliberating whether to approve the Project's Site Development Plan.

Moreover, Mr. Kusiak's declaration that the Project is "by-right" does not comport with CEQA. CEQA specifically does not apply to ministerial projects. (Public Resources Code cOp 21080(b).) The very fact that the DAB sought to approve an exemption from CEQA pursuant to Guideline section 15332 indicates that the Project is discretionary in that a CEQA exemption is not applicable to ministerial projects.
CEQA is intended to provide the public, and decisionmakers, with accurate information about the nature and full scope of a development. (County of Inyo V. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal. App. 3d 185, 192.) Providing inaccurate information, misleading the public, and other decisionmakers, as to their rights to review and analyze the Project is a disservice to the community and discourages thoughtful discussion necessary to shape a discretionary development review. (Id. [an "accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an informative and legally sufficient" review under CEQA.].) The inaccurate description of the Project must be corrected to comply with CEQA.

Similarly, Mr. Kusiak stated that the DAB had no authority to deny the Project's requested waiver under the State Density Bonus Law due to health and safety concerns (raised, largely, with respect to the dangerous traffic-related conditions at the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street). This, too, is an incorrect statement of the law and the scope of the City's authority to review the Project under CEQA. As indicated in our March 8, 2021 letter to the DAB, Government Code section 65915(e)(1) specifically provides that waivers of development standards under the State Density Bonus Law should not be granted when they would result in "specific, adverse impact... upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact." Though the DAB (and the DRB), as well as the City staff report, acknowledge that the Project's waivers result in specific, adverse impacts upon health, safety, and the physical environment without offer of satisfactory mitigation, due to the claimed exemption from CEQA, with respect to public realm improvements (resulting in hazardous traffic conditions), parking space size and drive aisle standards (resulting in hazardous traffic and parking conditions), open space standards, landscaping standards, and other deviations from development standards, these waivers were approved due to an inaccurate statement of the law - claiming that the DAB could not deny the waivers under circumstances where specific, adverse impacts to health and safety are expressly acknowledged to exist. In light of this, the Project's waivers must be reconsidered and its impacts on the environment reviewed to determine what mitigation measures may be imposed.
Further, in light of the rampant inaccuracies, misstatements of law, and impropriety of appointing City staff (i.e., the Community Development Director, City Engineer, Building Division Director, and Fire Marshal) to review staff recommendations, and afford discretionary

approval of projects, we strongly recommend the City reconsider its current practices. It does not appear that the composition of the DAB, nor the Design Review Board, afford any semblance of an impartial determination on matters of great importance to the public. Rather, these bodies
appear to act as "rubber-stamps" on staff decisions. At the very least, the Council should consider
having municipal attorney staff each such meeting to protect the City's interests, and those of
the community.

Re: Project No. 2020-16 (CityMark Communities LLC) - 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, CA

Dear Ms. Kinnard:

This law firm represents the St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California located at
5150 Wilson Street, directly adjacent to the La Mesa Woman's Club ("LMWC"), the site of a 49
residential unit and three commercial unit mixed-use project ("Project") proposed by CityMark Communities LLC ("CityMark") known as Project No. 2020-16. This correspondence is offered to inform the City of La Mesa ("City") of our client's grave concerns regarding the proposed Project, the limited conditions recommended to ensure the health and safety of the public, and the apparent lack of analysis of the Project's expected impacts.
We also wish to bring to the City's attention that on December 17, 2020 this firm requested to be placed on the notice list for all public hearings relating to the Project, and specifically those relating to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Notwithstanding this, we were only sent notice of the March 8, 2021, 12:30 p.m. Design Review Board ("DRB") meeting after regular work hours, at 8:10 p.m., on Thursday, March 4, 2021 (see Attachment "1"), indicating that the City requires audio/visual presentations by the public to be submitted by "12:00 noon, one business day prior to the start of the meeting." It would be practically impossible to prepare and transmit any presentation, let alone a thoughtful one, within three regular working hours of receipt of said notice (i.e., after 9 a.m. on March 5, 2021) to comply with the City's stated deadline. What
is more, no notice was sent to this office of the March 8, 2021, 10 a.m. Development Advisory Board ("DAB") meeting though we understand that an exemption to CEQA analysis is to be voted on in this hearing. In fact, it is solely due to our client's diligence in searching the City's website, at approximately 11:15 am on March 5, 2021, that we learned of the DAB meeting at all - again, making it impossible to provide the City with an audio/visual presentation by the 12:00 noon deadline set for that same day.

We understand that COVID-19 has altered the conditions by which we all live and work, and that the City is permitted to avoid direct communications from the public during such hearings

in light of California Executive Order N-29-20. Yet, the failure to afford the public a practical opportunity to review, analyze, and respond to the Project's 137-page DRB staff report and the 150-page DAB staff report does not comport with the public's statutory and constitutional rights to petition its government under the Ralph M. Brown Act. (Government Code 54950 et seq.; Cal. Const., Art. I § 3, subd. (a) and (b)(1), (7).) These actions run afoul of the law as they present limitations on public participation which are simply "too arbitrary and capricious, too restrictive and unreasonable." (Nevens v. Chino (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 775, 778; see also Robins V. Pruneyard Shopping Center (1979) 23 Cal.3d 899, 907 [The right of the people to petition the government for redress of grievances is "vital to a basic process in the state's constitutional scheme."].)

Furthermore, should CityMark, or its consultants, be permitted to present audio/visual materials to, or communicate directly with, the DAB or DRB boards during these hearings on March 8, 2021 it will only heighten the inequities inherent in providing late, or no, notice to the public, with regard to the respective rights of the parties to petition their government. This would be an unfortunate, and likely unlawful, action in unequal treatment under both state and federal statutes and constitutions. A more reasoned action would be to postpone each of the DAB and DRB hearings by a week, or more, to permit each party, and the public more generally, an opportunity to present their positions thoughtfully.
Notwithstanding this, we offer a limited summary of our client's position with respect to the proposed Project in the hopes that it will be presented to the DAB and DRB board members for review prior to any discussion of, or determination on, this matter. In light of the severely constrained time available to us before the DAB and DRB meetings, we will not reiterate each of the points made in prior communications and correspondence delivered to the City in opposition to the Project but join in those comments by this reference. Rather, we will focus briefly on the inadequate analysis of the Project in light of the City's General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, the Project's inapt use of California State Density Bonus Law (Gov. Code § 65915 et seq.) waivers, and the impropriety of the claimed CEQA exemption under Guidelines section 15332.

I. The Project Runs Afoul Of The General Plan's Urban Design Element And The Zoning Ordinance
As the staff reports to each of the DAB and DRB indicate, the Project site is designated as "Mixed Use Urban," corresponding to the Mixed Use (MU) Overlay, in the Residential Business base zone and is intended to support "pedestrian friendly housing." (DAB Staff Report, p. 2; DRB Staff Report, p.2.) Notwithstanding this, the Project seeks to avoid the very features it is obligated to provide to enable pedestrian-friendly housing.

The Project sits under 100 feet away, directly across Grossmont Boulevard, from the Grossmont Shopping Center. The closest supermarket to the Project is the Walmart Neighborhood Market therein, lying approximately 350 feet away, yet because there is no crosswalk, stop sign, at the intersection of Wilson Street and Grossmont Boulevard, a resident of and/or traffic signal the Project would be required to walk about three-quarters of a mile to safely cross the street, pick up groceries, and return with them - it is doubtful many residents will be able to lug an average family's weekly groceries this distance, on foot. (DAB Staff Report, p. 2 [In fact, the City recognizes this failing at the beginning of its report, "The intersection is not signalized and is lacking curb ramps and crosswalks."]; see also DRB Staff Report at p. 2 for the same acknowledgment of a dangerous condition].) Notwithstanding this, it appears the Project is being permitted to avoid the development of a crosswalk which is absolutely necessary for its residents or, at least, providing an analysis showing the Project will generate significantly more average daily vehicular trips and vehicle miles traveled than contemplated.
The City failed to require a traffic analysis for the Project, though it initially sought to require an ADA-compliant ramp be constructed at this intersection before apparently dropping this condition altogether. Our client's environmental consultant has also indicated this intersection is particularly dangerous because of limited sightlines arising from a substantial curve in Grossmont Boulevard in this area. The observation that this particular intersection is dangerous has been voiced numerous times in correspondence submitted to the City by multiple parties. Yet the staff reports show that no ramp, crosswalk, or analysis was required of the Project - instead, the Project is conditioned to provide a $5,000 "fair-share" payment toward a ramp to be built by an unknown party at an unknown time in the future. This does not comport with the law.
There appears to be no plan on file to develop a safe intersection at Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street, and the $5,000 payment does not appear to go towards any previously approved fund for that purpose. Nor is there any indication of how this figure was calculated. In Anderson First Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173, the appellate court held that paying a "fair-share fee" is permissible as effective mitigation only if the fees are "part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency commits itself to implementing." That is not the case in this instance. In light of this, the City must require the installation of an appropriately signalized intersection, or some other traffic calming feature here, or require the Project to present an analysis indicating why it should not do so. The only evidence in the administrative record, to date, on this topic shows that the City initially desired a crosswalk to be installed but backed off without explanation (or analysis available to the public, or the City's decisionmakers).
"In MU areas, new development is required to include pedestrian realm improvements along collector streets to encourage pedestrian activity. The Circulation Element classifies Grossmont Boulevard as a major collector street subject to pedestrian realm requirements." (DAB Staff Report, p. 2; DRB Staff Report, p. 2. [Emphasis added.]; see also La Mesa Municipal Code

PWM673

§ 24.18.040(B).) The condition to pay fee in lieu of an actual mitigation measure regarding a known project impact runs afoul of CEQA and should not be permitted. Rather the Project must be required to perform an analysis to determine the scope of the impact and to then propose a mitigation measure to reduce that impact to a less than significant level.
Moreover, this mitigation measure is improper on two other bases. First, it improperly attempts to defer mitigation until a later (and, in this case, unknown future) time. This is specifically forbidden under CEQA Guidelines, 15126.4 (a)(1)(B).) And second, a mitigation measure is only available if a project under CEQA is expected to generate a potentially significant impact on the environment, but the staff report indicates that the Project is exempt from CEQA because there are no such expected impacts. (DAB Staff Report, p. 7-8; see also DAB Staff Report, Attachment A, "Resolution No. DAB-2021-xx" at Par. 1.) So, either the Project is not exempt from CEQA and cannot be conditioned to mitigate a potentially significant impact, or it must be analyzed properly under CEQA (i.e., by preparation of an Initial Study, followed by specific impact category studies, and the development of a mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report). The status quo does not comport with the law. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network V. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102 [a public agency may not adopt mitigation measures for a project for the purpose of qualifying it for a categorical CEQA exemption; see also Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1200.)
A. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Limited To Overcoming Physical, Not Financial, Constraints Such That Avoiding Improvements To The Pedestrian Realm Are Not Permitted For This Project
As indicated above, the Project is designated Mixed Use Urban requiring improvements to the surrounding pedestrian realm. LMMC $ 24.18.020(E) defines the term "pedestrian realm" as follows:

"Pedestrian realm" means twelve-foot wide area located between the face of the curb of a Circulation Element designated street and the face of the building. The pedestrian realm includes the parkway, sidewalk, and landscaped areas. The pedestrian realm may include both public and private property where the public right-of-way is not twelve feet wide. Pedestrian amenities, street trees, street furniture, bus stop facilities, and other landscaping, as specified in this chapter, shall be included in the public realm.
Notwithstanding this acknowledged requirement, "[w]aivers are being requested to allow reductions in….. pedestrian realm requirements." (DAB Staff Report, p. 3; DRB Staff Report, p. 3.) For instance, the Project seeks a "waiver" under the State Density Bonus Law so that it may encroach four feet into the pedestrian realm along Grossmont Boulevard by installing balconies hanging over this right of way. This miscomprehends what a waiver is under the law.

PWM674

Pursuant to Government Code §65915(e)(1), waivers (as opposed to incentives) are a afforded to a density bonus project only when a "development standard will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development," not because the developer desires it, or because it will enhance the a financial prospects of a project. Put another way, a waiver permits deviation from, or altogether evasion of, regulations which affect a project due to its site-specific physical features. This subject site has no such physical constraints. Rather, the balconies could be built outside of the pedestrian realm (i.e., within the building envelope) by moving the exterior walls along Grossmont Boulevard back four feet, or removed altogether. The applicant itself makes clear that it is not a physical constraint that drives this waiver request when it states its
justification as follows:
This waiver is requested due to excessive space and cost impacts to incorporate the Open Space requirement and private balconies. The loss of development potential
to incorporate this would make the project infeasible to provide the affordable units.
As mentioned above, the site itself does not have any physical obstruction which precludes construction of these balconies, rather CityMark simply desires to have them overhang the pedestrian realm because it would increase their financial incentive to develop the Project. The
State Density Bonus Law permits this sort of deviation from regulation for financial gain through the use of incentives, of which the Project has two (waivers, on the other hand, are unlimited for
such developments). Yet, the Project avoids using any of its incentives and instead improperly
requests at least five waivers to avoid its open space requirements, building height limit, parking space sizing, landscaping required within the pedestrian realm, and overall parking requirements.
In each such instance, CityMark indicates that the justification for the waiver is not a physical
constraint unique to the site but rather the request is made to seek a financial boon for the
developer.

The reason the Project seeks to use waivers rather than incentives is clear on its face - the
State Density Bonus Law does not authorize a sufficient number of incentives (i.e., the Project requires five, but only has two available to it) to meet CityMark's desired financial goals, whereas it may request an unlimited number of waivers. Because it does not have sufficient incentives to develop the Project in this manner, it attempts to avoid their use altogether and instead make faulty justifications for waivers which are impermissible under the law.
Because CityMark cannot show a physical constraint exists which limits the development
of the Project under the City's laws and policies, it must use its incentives (and justify the use of
those incentives by showing the financial benefit gained thereby) and/or redesign the Project to be
in conformity with the law.

B. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Not Permitted To Overcome Regulations That Pertain To Health And Safety
As mentioned above, the Project's requests for waivers are inapposite to the law because they pertain to financial rather than physical constraints. In addition, the Project improperly seeks to waive the City's standard parking space and driving aisle dimensions even though this would result in direct health and safety impacts. Waivers are impermissible on this basis as well.

The dimensions of parking spaces and adjacent driving aisles are specified to ensure the safety of vehicles, their drivers and passengers, and pedestrians. (LMMC § 22.112.010(B).) This makes common sense - if spaces and driving aisles are too small, or otherwise constrained, they are likelier to lead to physical harm from other vehicles when vacating or entering space and are the reason why State building codes requires minimum parking dimensions to ensure health and. safety. (DAB Staff Report, p. 3 & Attachment D, pp. 3-4; DRB Staff Report, p. 3 & Attachment E, pp. 3-4.)
Government Code section 65915(e)(1) of the State Density Bonus Law provides:
Nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted to require a local government to waive or reduce development standards if the waiver or reduction would have a specific, adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5, upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact. [Emphasis added.]
Thus, a waiver cannot be used to avoid the specific, adverse impact arising from the reduction of a basic safety feature inherent in parking stall/space sizes and driving aisle dimensions as contemplated by the Project due to the health and safety issues it raises. No justification exists which would be sufficient to overcome this requested reduction in health and safety standards, nor would an incentive permit such a thing.
C. The Project, As Designed, Is Contrary To The Chief Land Use Policies Declared Under The Land Use And Urban Design Element Of The General Plan
California law requires each city and county to adopt a general plan, a comprehensive long- term plan for the development of that city or county, famously referred to by the state Supreme Court as the "constitution for future development." (Lesher Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 540.) A general plan must contain seven mandatory "elements," including a "land use element" to designate the level of intensity and general distribution of land uses. (Gov. Code § 65302.) "[T]he propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development depends upon [a finding of] consistency with the applicable general plan and its

PWM676

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
March 8, 2021
Page 7 of 13

elements." (Resource Defense Fund v. County of Santa Cruz (1982) 133 Cal.App.3rd 800, 806.) CEQA imposes an obligation on La Mesa to assess the Project's consistency with the City's
General Plan. (North Coast Rivers Alliance et al. v. Marin Municipal Water District (2013) 216
Cal.App.4th 614, 633.) The Project, as designed and proposed, cannot be found to be consistent
with the Land Use and Urban Design Element of the City's General Plan.

By way of example:

1) Policy LU-1.2.2 requires that "[a]s part of the development review process, City departments will review all future development to ensure that safety requirements are met, including building and fire codes, accessibility standards and crime prevention techniques. Yet, as indicated above, the City's failure to ensure that the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street indicates that no such review has been performed (or that, if it has, the requirement
to ensure safety has been obviated) such that a dangerous condition not only is permitted to exist, but it is being worsened by increasing the vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the area while also
attempting to authorize a large development where a single-story structure currently exists, further reducing sight lines on a dangerous curve in the road. Similarly, the proposed waivers to reduce parking space dimensions and drive aisle widths do not "ensure that safety requirements are met, including building and fire codes, [nor] accessibility standards."
2) Policy LU-2.1.2 requires the City to "[s]upport infill development and subdivision
proposals that reinforce neighborhood strengths and benefit neighborhood identity,' yet the Project proposes a development which is so different in character and intensity from any other in the neighborhood, both with respect to its architectural style and the materials used on its exterior walls - none of which can be found elsewhere in this community. Thus, it cannot be said that this Project will "reinforce" the existing visual appeal of the community.
3) Policy LU-2.1.5 requires the implementation of projects in the "Mixed-Use Overlay
Zone by promoting the rehabilitation of properties and new development that fits into the context
of the existing neighborhoods while meeting the City's Urban Design Objectives for infill
development." Again, as noted directly above, in #2, the Project is completely out of character
and context with respect to the existing neighborhood such that this policy cannot be met.
4) Policy LU-4.2.3 requires that "[n]ew development shall provide adequate
parking." As the Project specifically seeks to not only reduce parking space numbers below the City's normal standards, it also seeks to reduce the number below those permitted under the State
Density Bonus Law (albeit, improperly attempting to do SO via a waiver, as indicated in the immediately preceding two sections of this letter). Also, as indicated in the immediately preceding section, the Project does not provide adequate parking not only with respect to the reduced number of spaces it proposes, but also improperly attempts to reduce the dimensions of the spaces and the drive aisles around them in a manner likely to impact the public's (and future residents') health and safety. Thus, the Project clearly conflicts with this policy as well.
5) Objective UD-1.1 requires the City's "ItJo protect La Mesa's existing built
environment and cultural heritage." But the Project proposes to destroy the LMWC clubhouse

PWM677

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
March 8, 2021
Page 8 of 13

which has been in place for over half a century and, thus, conflicts directly and inarguably with this policy.
6) Objective UD-3.1 requires that development be "architecturally and environmentally sensitive and ...compatible with neighboring design and scale." As indicated in the discussions regarding Policy LU-1.2.2 and Policy LU-2.1.2 directly above, the Project is unlike anything in this neighborhood, especially with respect to its design and scale, and therefore, conflicts with this objective of the General Plan.
In short, the Project cannot be said to be in harmony with the City's General Plan Land Use and Urban Design Element as proposed. As such, it must be revised significantly to come into conformance with the General Plan, and the surrounding community.

II. The Project Fails To Comply With The California Environmental Quality Act
The primary purposes of CEQA are to inform City decisionmakers, as well as the public, about the potential impacts of a project, and a to prescribe mitigation measures to avoid such impacts. CEQA requires a broad view of what constitutes a project requiring environmental analysis. (McQueen v. Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1143.) Even projects that appear benign will likely fall within the ambit of CEQA. (Bloom v. McGurk (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1307, 1312.) The California State Legislature formulated CEQA to "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of the environment shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions." (Pub. Res. Code §21001(d).) To implement this goal, CEQA requires municipalities to analyze discretionary projects for potential environmental impacts utilizing a three-tier system. (No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 74.) The first tier is known as a preliminary review. The preliminary review requires public agency staff to analyze a complete application in order to discern the full scope of the project at issue. (CEQA Guidelines section 15060(b); City of Pasadena v. The State of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 810, 836.) Once the parameters of the project are established, a determination is made to resolve whether an exemption is applicable to the project. If such an exemption is found, the agency must determine that no exceptions to the exemption are triggered by the potential impacts from the full scope of the project. (CEQA Guidelines §§ 15060, 15061.) If the project is not exempt from CEQA, or an exception is applicable, the second tier of review is required wherein an initial study is prepared because it has been determined that there is a possibility that the project may have a significant effect on the environment. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063.) An initial study facilitates environmental assessment early in the design of a project. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063(c).) In the third tier, the initial study is used to demonstrate that either: a) the project "will not have a significant effect," triggering the preparation of a negative declaration, or b) the project is one "which may have a significant effect on the environment," triggering the preparation of an environmental impact report ("EIR"). (CEQA Guidelines § 15064.)

PWM678

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard
March 8, 2021
Page 9 of 13

While the Guidelines provide opportunities for projects to be exempted from CEQA
review, these exemptions are limited in nature. "Only those projects having no significant effect
on the environment are categorically exempt from CEQA review." (Salmon Protection &
Watershed Network, supra, at p. 1102.) A significant effect is a "substantial, or potentially
substantial, adverse change in the environment." (Pub. Res. Code $21068. [Emphasis added.]) This means that an activity has a significant effect if, among other things, it "has the potential to degrade the quality of the environment." (Pub. Res. Code § 21083.) "[A]n activity that may have a significant effect on the environment cannot be categorically exempt." ."* (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 124. [Emphasis added.])

The courts review categorical exemptions using strict construction in a manner affording the greatest environmental protection within the reasonable scope of the statutory language. (County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 966.)
"[E]xemption categories are not to be expanded or broadened beyond the reasonable scope of their
statutory language." (Dehne v. County of Santa Clara (1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 827, 842.) Thus, an
exemption must be applicable in light of the full scope of a project.

A public agency has the burden of proving that substantial evidence supports its factual
finding that project falls within the asserted exemption. (Da vidon Homes v. City of San Jose, 54
Cal. App. 4th 106, 114-115 (1997); Magan v. County of Kings (2002) 105 Cal.App.4th 468, 475.) "An agency's duty to provide such factual support 'is all the more important where the record shows ...that opponents of the project have raised arguments regarding possible significant environmental impacts.?" (Muzzy Ranch Co. v. Solano County Airport Land Use Com. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 372, 386.) A city cannot impose a burden on the public to prove a possibility of adverse environmental impacts since this would frustrate CEQA's fundamental purpose of ensuring that government officials "make decisions with environmental consequences in mind." (Davidon Homes, supra, at p. 116; California Farm Bureau Federation v. California Wildlife Conservation Bd. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 186.) "[TJhe agency's exemption determination must be supported by evidence in the record demonstrating that the agency considered possible environmental impacts in reaching its decision." (Da vidon Homes, supra, at p. 117; East Peninsula Ed. Council, Inc. v. Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School Dist. (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 155, 171.)
The record before the City, limited as it is because of the lack of analysis performed by CityMark, reveals that the Project's potential effects on the environment make the application of a categorical exemption legally inappropriate. In fact, most of the environmental analysis performed, to date, has been by the church's experts and those analysis have not been challenged,
nor apparently analyzed by the City.

A. The City May Not Apply The In-Fill Development Exemption In Light Of The Project's Expected, and Known, Potentially Significant Impacts
The City proposes to avoid CEQA review of the Project by employing the In-Fill Development exemption found at CEQA Guidelines section 15332. This exemption provides that in-fill development may avoid CEQA analysis if:
(a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations.
(b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses. (c) The project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species.
(d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality. (e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.
Our client has secured all Project materials the City purports to have in its possession or control via the California Public Records Act ("CPRA"). In securing this data, it has become readily obvious that very little analysis of the Project's potentially significant impacts to the environment have been performed to date. In fact, the only data in the administrative record analyzing the Project under CEQA has been provided by our client's environmental experts. These analyses, and the records produced pursuant to the above-mentioned CPRA request, indicate that though CityMark submitted an "Environmental Assessment/Initial Study Application" the City has performed no analysis of its own and has no Initial Study to indicate whether further environmental review must occur. Moreover, the expert analyses provided by our client, concretely and definitively specifies potentially significant impacts in the following CEQA categories:

(1) Air quality impacts arising from construction. This is especially important in that the Project proposes significant grading - "400 cubic yards of excavation (cut) and 1,400 cubic yards of fill…. primarily used to raise the rear of the site to establish a pad for the parking area [along with].... [a] retaining wall of up to eight and a half feet in height is planned along the south end of the parking area" - which is directly adjacent to the area where 125 students currently attend the Warren Walker School, on the church campus. These students are sensitive receptors, spending time outdoors to learn and play, and with open windows, especially during the COVID-19 era, to provide additional ventilation limiting disease spread. (2) Noise impact arising from construction. Again, much like the air impacts category, directly above, but likely to last significantly longer as the construction noise will exist

throughout the site's development both before (during demolition) and long past (during construction) the grading operations. The noise from all of this construction will flow unimpeded into the directly adjacent school and playground disrupting hundreds of children's' education for what is likely to be a period of one to two years.
(3) Hazardous materials disposal during construction. The LMWC building was constructed prior to the elimination of asbestos-containing materials, lead-based paints,
and polychlorinated biphenyls, yet no analysis has been made of these hazards (or
methods to mitigate these potential hazards) upon adjacent residents, churchgoers,
senior living facility residents, and/or schoolchildren.
(4) Hydrology and water quality impacts from the developed Project. The church's experts have analyzed the existing site, and the proposed Project at build-out, and determined
that the Project's drainage study inaccurately describes the conditions such that considerably more stormwater is expected to flow onto the church property than
reported.
(5) Transportation impacts from construction and the developed Project. These impacts include significant numbers of heavy-haul trucks going through Wilson Street (designated a local collector) interrupting regular traffic and parking along the road, as well as church and school pick-ups and drop-offs, and a failure to follow the current standard in traffic analysis under CEQA, namely a vehicle miles traveled (VMT) analysis pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15064.3. And as indicated above, the analysis indicates the dangers inherent in the intersection at Grossmont Boulevard and
Wilson Street.

But for the Project's hydrology and water quality analyses, the church's expert analyses on the remaining impact categories described above remain the only information in the administrative record such that the City cannot simply overlook the described potentially significant impacts. Neither the Project applicant, nor the City itself, have made any attempt to respond to these expert analyses such that CEQA requires that an initial study be prepared. (Hansen Brothers Enterprises, Inc. V. Board of Supervisors (1996) 12 Cal.4th 533, 560 [standing for the proposition that undisputed evidence in the administrative record must be relied upon.].) Until such time as the Project applicant, or the City, rebut the evidence presented by the church's experts, and with
respect to certain issues, the testimony, and opinions of laypersons, those remain the only materials
upon which the City may rely in determining whether the exemption to CEQA under Guidelines section 15332 may be effective.
Under CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c), "[a] categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect
on the environment due to unusual circumstances." Such an exception to CEQA Guidelines section
15332 exists in the administrative record in light of church's undisputed expert testimony as to impact categories described above. The City may not ignore evidence of an unusual circumstance creating a reasonable possibility of a significant environmental impact. (Committee to Save the

Hollywoodland Specific Plan v City of Los Angeles (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1187; McQueen v Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1148; Lewis v Seventeenth District Agricultural Association (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 823, 211.)
In light of these facts, the City cannot use a categorical exemption to avoid further analysis of the Project and must proceed to prepare an initial study followed by the preparation of a mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report permitting the public and the City's decisionmakers a thoughtful and reasoned opportunity to examine the totality of the Project and its potential impacts.

III. Conclusion

The City has failed to provide the public with a substantive opportunity to participate in a public forum regarding this Project in light of the inadequate (and with respect to the DAB, non- existent) notice, along with the practical impossibility of petitioning the government with a
fulsome expression of the public's interests and grievances with regard to the development. The sharply limited deadlines needlessly imposed on the public do not comport with the law.
Further, the Project does not comply with the City's General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, the State Density Bonus Law, nor CEQA. In all, this Project must be sent back for significant further revisions and review.

We further note that the church is now engaged in quiet title action with the LMWC, before the superior court, over the church's driveway to resolve the ownership, possession, and control of this area. Should the court determine that the church is the title owner of the land, the Project's total size will be sharply a reduced resulting in a significant reduction in its base density, as well as any density bonus which may be afforded to it under the current proposal. Moreover, the Project seeks to install a tall retaining wall along this driveway, which will not be permissible upon the church securing explicit title in this land. And, the Project plans show that the church's driveway is being improperly shown as a fire truck access road during times of emergency though it does not offer access to the Project site given the steep slope separating the properties. In light of this, we strongly recommend the City hold back any decision which may result in confusing these issues or bringing the City into the action unnecessarily.

We note the DRB and DAB Staff Reports both inaccurately claim that the Project site at 5220 Wilson Street is owned by CityMark. It is, in fact, owned solely by the LMWC according to the church's latest information.

Subiect: Brown Act Demand for Cure and Correction Regarding Development Advisory Board

Honorable Mayor Arapostathis and City Council:
This demand is made on behalf of this firm's client, St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California ("SLLC"*). All further communications regarding this matter should be directed to this office.

On March 8, 2021 at 10 am (PST), the City of La Mesa ("City') Development Advisory Board ("DAB") held a public hearing with respect to the prospective development of the La Mesa Woman's Club property at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California 91942 (the "Project"), and its claimed exemption from the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Leading up to, and during the course of, that DAB hearing the City ran afoul of the Ralph M. Brown Act (Government Code sections 54950 et seq.; the "Brown Act") which requires the public be afforded various rights to be heard, and to hear, about matters of public concern such as the Project. These rights were violated, and this situation must be rectified by the City Council.
We present this correspondence in the hopes that the City Council will take this opportunity to cure or otherwise correct these Brown Act violations so that no further action need be taken by the SLLC to resolve these issues.

Violations of the Brown Act

1. The Brown Act, at Government Code section 54954.3(a), requires public agencies provide:

.,.an opportunity for members of the public to directly address the legislative body on any item of interest to the public, before or during the

PWM688

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Honorable Mayor Arapostathis and City Council
April 7, 2021
Page 2 of 5

legislative body's consideration of the item, that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the legislative body…..
(Emphasis added.)

On December 17, 2020, this firm specifically requested to be notified of all Project and CEQA-related hearings. The City, through its City Clerk, acknowledged receipt of the request on December 28, 2020. (Exhibit "A".) Notwithstanding this, we never received notice of the March 8, 2021 DAB hearing from the City. Rather, our client fortuitously notified us of the DAB hearing on March 5, 2021 at approximately 11:15 am. Making matters worse, the DAB staff report
indicated that any audio/visual presentation to be made by the public would need to be submitted by 12:00 pm on that same day - March 5, 2021. (Exhibit "B".)
As it is impossible to put a together such a presentation, and to submit it to the City, in the span of 45 minutes, SLLC was not able to present its position, in full, during the course of the DAB's consideration of the Project. This is violative of Government Code section 54954.3(a) in that the City failed to afford this firm, and the public generally, an opportunity to directly address the DAB as required.

We strongly suggest the City Council correct this by ordering the DAB hold a new hearing on the Project and that the public be afforded proper notice of this new hearing.

2. The Brown Act does not permit the City to limit public participation in a manner
that is "too arbitrary and capricious, too restrictive and unreasonable." Nevens v. Chino (1965) 233 V. Cal.App.2d 775, 778; see also Robins v. Pruneyard Shopping Center (1979) 23 Cal.3d 899, 907 (The right of the people to petition the government for redress of grievances is "vital to a basic process in the state's constitutional scheme."]; Cal. Const., Art. I, § 3(a), (b)(1), and (b)(7).
Yet, this is precisely what the City did in foisting a 150-page DAB staff report, without
notice, on the public. It followed this violative action by then restricting the public's ability to
participate in the March 8, 2021 hearing - the staff report indicated that public comments had to be delivered solely via email by 8:00 am on March 8, 2021, so that only the first 300 words of any
such comment would be placed into the record before the DAB. Of the public comments that were read, the majority indicated they had insufficient time to review the staff report, and/or that they were elderly and without access to email (requiring the assistance of family members', with limited
time and resources of their own, to register their position with respect to the Project). This,
notwithstanding the fact, that each of the DAB board members, the City staff, and Project applicant
spoke freely, and without limitation in fact, the DAB chair continued the Project's hearing repeatedly to permit one of the applicant's consultants an opportunity to appear resulting in the closure of the hearing almost two hours after it started. Yet, not a single member of the public was
permitted to speak, or to present anything more than 300 words.

PWM689

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Honorable Mayor Arapostathis and City Council April 7, 2021
Page 3 of 5

In light of the egregious nature of the City's handling of the public comment portion of the hearing, which can only be considered arbitrary, capricious, restrictive, and unreasonable in light of the opportunities afforded to the Project applicant, we strongly recommend the City Council correct this violation of the Brown Act by ordering a new DAB hearing affording the public a right to be heard.

3. The Brown Act prohibits serial meetings - that is, a majority of the decision making members may not "use a series of communications of any kind, directly or through intermediaries, to discuss, deliberate, or take action on any item of business outside of the public meeting. Government Code § 54952.2(b). Yet, this is precisely what happened (and likely happens with respect to all DAB matters) in that each of the board members of that body are City staff members (Community Development Director Kerry Kusiak, City Engineer Leon Firsht, Building Division Director Aaron Sturm, and Fire Marshal Steve Swaney), all of whom by necessity of their respective positions specifically interacted with one another, either serially or in groups, to determine what impacts, requirements, conditions, and features the Project has, or should have.
Such discussions of the Project, and the DAB's ultimate outcome, run afoul of the Brown Act and cannot conceivably be corrected without the replacement of each of the board members with individuals other than City staff members. We suggest the City Council disband the DAB and appoint new board members whose positions do not require that they review, discuss, and otherwise weigh in on development projects which go before the DAB to avoid such conflicts going forward. We further suggest that in light of these circumstances, the DAB's approval of the Project, and its prospective CEQA exemption, be rescinded until such time as a new DAB board is empaneled.

Further, we note what appears to be a misconception on the part of the DAB chair, Mr. Kusiak. Throughout the DAB meeting, Mr. Kusiak claimed that this was "not a public hearing" a but was instead a "posted board meeting" which "did not require public noticing." This is incorrect.
Government Code section 54952(b) provides that the provisions of the Brown Act cover "legislative bodies" which include each:
...commission, committee, board, or other body of a local agency, whether permanent or temporary, decision making or advisory, created by charter, ordinance, resolution, or formal action of a legislative body....

The DAB is a such a "legislative body" for the purposes of the Brown Act in that it is a permanent board, created by the City through by ordinance and/or formal action. See, for instance, La Mesa Municipal Code ("LMMC") § 24.02.010 [specifying the responsibility of the DAB to review development proposals and specifically indicating it is subordinate to the City Council pursuant to Ord. 2600 §§ 2-6 formulated April 28, 1992); LMMC § 24.02.035 [requiring site

PWM690

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Honorable Mayor Arapostathis and City Council April 7, 2021
Page 4 of 5

development plan approval by the § DAB]; LMMC § 2.66.110 [requiring the DAB to meet with respect to certain development projects pursuant to Ordinance 2457, July 14, 1987]; and LMMC § 24.02.037 (Ord. 97-2686 $ 2 formulated November 25, 1997); LMMC § 22.04.010 (Ord. 2315 formulated May 26, 1983); LMMC § 18.18.060 (Ord. 2358 formulated June 21, 1984); LMMC §
22.03.010 (Ord. § 2006-2774 § 1 formulated November 28, 2006); and LMMC § 22.02.010 (Ord.
2307; March 24, 1983.) In short, there is little question that the DAB is subject to the Brown Act.

A meeting is defined by the Brown Act as "any congregation by a majority" of the legislative body at the same time and place to "hear, discuss, or deliberate" on any matter within the jurisdiction of the body. The Brown Act, Open Meetings For Local Legislative Bodies, Office of the Attorney General, 2003, at p. 8. Because all of the DAB board members congregated together, albeit by remote video conference, to hear, discuss and deliberate on the Project's site development plan and CEQA exemption, the requirement for a public meeting under the Brown
Act is met. In light of these facts, the DAB's March 8. 2021 hearing on the Project was, and is, a public hearing subject to all of the requirements of the Brown Act, contrary: to Mr. Kusiak's
assertions.

We strongly recommend the City Council direct the City Attorney, or other legal counsel, properly train the DAB board members, and the City staff more generally, on the requirements of
the Brown Act to avoid such confusion and any further violations in the future.

CONCLUSION

Given the above points, SLLC demands the City Council:

(1) Acknowledge the violations described above and make a commitment not to act in a
similar manner in the future;
(2) Afford the public a reasonable opportunity to communicate with the DAB prior to, and
during, all future public hearings of the board;
(3) Revise the constituents of the DAB board to comport with the Brown Act;
(4) Revise the LMMC with respect to the DAB board to comport with the Brown Act; and (5) Rescind any and all actions taken during the March 8, 2021 DAB hearing on the Project pending further rehearing by the reconstituted DAB.

The City Council must notify this office of its decision to cure and correct as demanded no later than 5 p.m. on Friday, May 7, 2021.
Should the City Council fail, or refuse to perform as demanded, this will serve as evidence of an actual and present disagreement over the public's rights and the City's responsibilities under the Brown Act and may lead my client to consider legal action as authorized by the Brown Act. It

the SLLC's sincere desire this action not be required and that the City Council take up the interests of the public, and its mandated duties under the Brown Act, without delay.

Glenn,

Sorry I was unable to pick up the phone when you called today. I have some litigation and mediation deadlines to meet this week, so likely will not be able to talk today or tomorrow.
I understand that the La Mesa City Council has not made a determination as to whether it will cure and/or correct the deviations from the Brown Act specified in our April 7, 2021 correspondence - please correct me if some action has been taken, as I have received no notice of such action. My calendar shows that tomorrow, May 7, 2021, represents the last day upon which such a determination may be made, starting the 15-day clock for my client to file a petition for writ of mandate to seek the court's direction. As will be out of town when this deadline runs, will be forced to file by April 21, 2021. I further understand from your voicemail, that you believe there may be some solution to this, or perhaps some other issues raised by St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California in its appeal of the Development Advisory Board's March 8, 2021 approval of the development proposal, and CEQA exemption thereto, at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, CA 91942.

My client welcomes workable resolutions to its claims, so I would ask that you get back to me by email with sufficient time to avoid litigation - there is, unfortunately, not much time to do so in light of the short deadlines imposed under the Brown Act So that I can quickly pass your suggestions along.

Regards,
Felix

Re: April 7, 2021 Correspondence-Brown Act Demand for Cure and Correction Regarding
Development Advisory Board

Dear Mr. Tinkov:

This correspondence addresses your correspondence as referenced above. Please note that numerous discussions have transpired among City staff over the years regarding the elimination of the Development Advisory Board (DAB) for various reasons. Your
correspondence has prompted City staff to begin the approprlate process for elimination
(please see the attached emails between Kerry Kusiak, Director of Planning and Community
Development and Greg Humora, City Manager). Furthermore, at my direction, now development applications in the future will not be subject to DAB review.

believe this action should suffice to remedy any allegations of Brown Act violations that you
have asserted.

Also, because of the issues raised in your correspondence, if SO requested by your Client, City
staff would be happy to "redo" the March 8, 2021 DAB hearing on the development project
planned at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California,

Please contact me with any questions, concerns or requests. Thank you and have a pleasant
vacation,

Kerry,

Thank you for your emall.

After discussions with the City Attorney, we both agree that your suggestions regarding the DAB should be implemented. Therefore, in conjunction with the City Attorney's office (after consultation with the Mayor), I will be placing this matter on the Council agenda for its consideration as soon as possible, but no later than 30 days from today. Furthermore, at the direction of the City Attorney, as of today, no further new applications will be processed through the DAB. This action remedies any allegations of Brown Act violations regarding the DAB.

Subject: Development Advisory Board

Greg,
As we have discussed, the appellant's attorney in the Wilson Street project (2020-16) has also challenged the validity of the makeup of the Development Advisory Board (DA8) under the Brown Act. The challenge centers on the contention that the staff that make up the DAB (Director of Community Development, Director of Publiç Works, Building Official, and Fire Marshali) have serial meetings in violation of the Act. The attorney notes that the staff on the board necessarily interact outside of public meetings to perform the function of project revlew.
In this regard, think the attorney may be on point. To remedy this situation, I suggest that the DAB be eliminated as soon as possible and replaced with an administrative review process under the authority of the Community Development Director. The process could include same level of public review period of projects prior to a decision being made, with the possibility of appeal. Since the DAB was established by ordinance, an ordinance would be needed to amend the Zoning Code to remove the DAB and Insert the administrative process. If you are in agreement with this approach, we could have a staff report ready to introduce the concept to the City Council and receive authorization to proceed as carly as the Council meeting scheduled for May 25, 2021.

Further, I would suggest that no new applications received going forward should be heard by the DAB. With that in mind, we would proceed immediately with an amendment once authorized to establish a new process as quickly as possible so as not to delay the project review process.

Subject: RE: St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California

Good afternoon Glenn,

I hope this message finds you well.

First, I must note an error in my message of May 6, 2021 below - had mistakenly indicated that I would be required to file a petition by April 21, 2021 which, of course, would be impossible. I had intended to say that because of previously planned travel, I would have to file by May 21, 2021.
With that out of the way, I have reviewed your letter and while I appreciate what appears to be an earnest desire on the part of Mr. Humora and Mr. Kusiak to eliminate the Development Advisory Board, this response to St. Luke's April 7, 2021 Brown Act Demand for Cure and Correction is legally deficient. The Brown Act requires that the legislative body (i.e., the City Council) review the asserted violations in such a demand and to take action. (See, for instance, Government Code Section 54960.1(c)(2) ["Within 30 days of receipt of the demand, the legislative body shall cure or correct the challenged action and inform the demanding party in writing of its actions to cure or correct or inform the demanding party in writing of its decision not to cure or correct the challenged action."].)
Though Mr. Humora is the City is Manager, and Mr. Kusiak is the Director of Planning and Community Development, I am not aware of any statutory or caselaw which would indicate they have the authority to respond to a demand of this nature in compliance with the Act. Of course, if you have some legal basis to believe otherwise, I look forward to reviewing the material. Failing this, and in light of what I understand to be inaction on the part of the City Council with respect to my client's allegations of improprieties under the Brown Act, St. Luke's is forced to proceed as indicated previously (and corrected above).

Sincerely,
Felix Tinkov

Re: May 11, 2021 Correspondence-Brown Act Demand for Cure and Correction Regarding Development Advisory Board

Dear Mr. Tinkov:

This correspondence addresses your correspondence referenced above. Perhaps further information will alay your Client's concerns regarding Brown Act Violations by the Development Advisory Board (DAB). First, a draft ordinance eliminating the DAB is scheduled for consideration by the La Mesa City Council on May 25, 2021 (agenda available on May 21, 2021) ("Ordinance"). Staff and the City Attorney's office will be recommending adoption. In La Mesa, the Mayor and the City Manager set the Council agenda. My strong anticipation is that the In Ordinance will be adopted. In that event, obviously, the City will seek to dismiss any Brown Act lawsuit filed regarding the DAB and refuse any request related for Attorneys' fees.
Furthermore, as I mentioned in my earlier correspondence, at the City Attorney's directive, no new development applications will be considered by the DAB pending the final outcome related to the Ordinance.

Thank you for your consideration and I hope this information has been helpful.

CITY OF
LAMESA
JEWEL of the HILLS STAFF REPORT

REPORT to the MAYOR and MEMBERS of the CITY COUNCIL
From the CITY MANAGER

DATE: May 25, 2021

SUBJECT: Consideration and Introduction of an Ordinance Adopting Amendments to the La Mesa Municipal Code to Dissolve the Development Advisory Board and to Delegate the Functions thereof to the City Departments Formerly Represented on that Board.

ISSUING DEPT.: Community Development

SUMMARY:

Issues:

Should the La Mesa Municipal Code be amended to dissolve the Development Advisory Board and delegate the functions of the Board to the City Departments formerly represented on the Board?

Recommendation:

Introduce for first reading an ordinance adopting amendments to the La Mesa Municipal Code to dissolve the Development Advisory Board and delegate the functions thereof to
the City Departments formerly represented on the Board.

Fiscal Impact:

The proposed amendments to the La Mesa Municipal Code are organizational and administrative in nature and would have no fiscal impact.

City's Strategic Goals:

Continue to improve high quality municipal services,

BACKGROUND:

The Development Advisory Board (DAB) is comprised of the Director of Community Development, the Director of Public Works, the Building Official, and the Fire Marshal. The DAB is charged with the review and approval of applications for site development plans, tentative parcel maps, and other minor applications. The DAB provides recommendations to the Planning Commission on development projects that require Planning Commission review and approval, such as tentative tract maps, conditional use permits, and special permits. Each of the

PWM721

Report to Mayor and Councilmembers Date: May 25, 2021 Page 2 of 3 2

members of the DAB is an integral part of the development review process. The DAB members, or their supervised staff, collaborate and coordinate on the review of development projects regularly to ensure project compliance with codified requirements and to ensure consistency between departments in the review process. Each DAB member is charged with review of projects relative to the requirements within their discipline of work, and with crafting appropriate conditions of approval for projects.
The DAB considers projects for approval in regular, public meetings held on the second and fourth Mondays of each month. The agendas for these meetings are posted not less than 72 hours prior to the meeting time in compliance with the Brown Act. Final determinations on projects can be delayed by several weeks after they are ready to proceed while they wait for a scheduled meeting date to occur.

Staff has been considering and evaluating the DAB and the DAB process to discover if there iS a more effective and efficient manner to conduct the business currently undertaken by the DAB.

DISCUSSION:

The DAB process could be achieved in a more streamlined fashion while maintaining the integrity and transparency of the process. Staff suggests the functions that the DAB performs be delegated to the staff members that make up the DAB, but in an administrative process that is coordinated under the Director of Community Development. Currently, each of the DAB members is primarily concerned with the project's compliance with requirements within their discipline. This is in contrast to a typical board or commission, where members consider the whole of a project and whether it complies with all of the applicable requirements related to all disciplines. With an administrative process, each department would continue to review projects in relation to their areas of responsibility and expertise, and develop appropriate conditions of approval.

The Director of Community Development would gather the project reviews and conditions of approval from each of the reviewing departments in a notice of decision that provides a report on the project and its compliance with applicable requirements, and serves as an approval document that includes conditions of approval. The draft notices of decision would be posted for five calendar days in the same manner and places that DAB agendas are currently posted to allow the public time to comment on the project. Any comments received would be considered prior to making the determination proposed in the draft notice of decision. Final approvals of the Director of Community Development would be subject to appeal to the Planning Commission, and then the City Council, similar to the current DAB appeal process.
The elimination of the DAB meeting would allow projects to proceed to the approval process when ready. Applicants would not have to wait for a regularly scheduled meeting to occur. The posting of draft notices of decision would continue to provide an opportunity for the public to comment on projects prior to approval, and comments received would be treated in the same fashion as they are with the current DAB process. Further, it has been brought to the attention of the City Council and staff (via correspondence dated April 7, 2021) that the regular interaction of DAB staff outside public meetings may not be properly aligned with public meeting laws (Brown Act). The elimination of the DAB would obviate any such concerns.

Leon, I don't think the condition is supportable without their agreement. It would be better to officially ask them to do so to allay community concern, include it if they say ves and document their "no" if they go that way. There are CEQA implications otherwise. Glad to discuss further.

Leon,
The Wilson Street project is scheduled for DAB on Monday, and a bike lane condition needs to be
added to the draft COA. I found the following in Phil's notes from our traffic meeting with the
applicant in December. Is this language sufficient for the condition:

PWM752

• Restripe Grossmont Blvd. in the vicinity of Wilson St. to improve location of limit line and provide eastbound bike lanes and transitions to existing striping at either end. The notes contained one other comment that is another possible condition of approval, if so
desired:
Develop and implement an outreach program to minimize the number of two-plus vehicle families, inform and educate residents about the benefits of active transportation (biking and walking) and local transit opportunities to reduce the overall number of vehicle trips and the demand for auto parking, particularly offsite. Include onsite parking in monthly unit
rental.
Conditions for a sight-distance easement and $5K contribution towards curb ramp at SE corner of
the intersection are already included in the draft COA. Confirmation on the language for the two
additional conditions bulleted above is all that is needed.

Hollywoodland Specific Plan v City of Los Angeles (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1187; McQueen
v Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1148; Lewis v Seventeenth District Agricultural Association (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 823, 211.)

In light of these facts, the City cannot use a categorical exemption to avoid further analysis of the Project and must proceed to prepare an initial study followed by the preparation of a mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report permitting the public and the
City's decisionmakers a thoughtful and reasoned opportunity to cxamine the totality of the Project and its potential impacts.

III. Conclusion

The City has failed to provide the public with a substantive opportunity to participate in a public forum regarding this Project in light of the inadequate (and with respect to the DAB, non- existent) notice, along with the practical impossibility of petitioning the government with a fulsome expression of the public's interests and grievances with regard to the development. The sharply limited deadlines needlessly imposed on the public do not comport with the law.
Further, the Project does not comply with the City's General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, the State Density Bonus Law, nor CEQA. In all, this Project must be sent back for significant further revisions and review.

We further note that the church is now engaged in a quiet title action with the LMWC, before the superior court, over the church's driveway to resolve the ownership, possession, and control of this area. Should the court determine that the church is the title owner of the land, the Project's total size will be sharply reduced resulting in significant reduction in its base density, as well as any density bonus which may be afforded to it under the current proposal. Moreover,
the Project seeks to install a tall retaining wall along this driveway, which will not be permissible upon the church securing explicit title in this land. And, the Project plans show that the church's driveway is being improperly shown as a fire truck access road during times of emergency though it does not offer access to the Project site given the steep slope separating the properties. In light of this, we strongly recommend the City hold back any decision which may result in confusing these issues or bringing the City into the action unnecessarily.

We note the DRB and DAB Staff Reports both inaccurately claim that the Project site at 5220 Wilson Street is owned by CityMark. It is, in fact, owned solely by the LMWC according to the church's latest in formation.

throughout the site's development both before (during demolition) and long past (during construction) the grading operations. The noise from all of this construction will flow unimpeded into the directly adjacent school and playground disrupting hundreds of children's' education for what is likely to be period of one to two years. (3) Hazardous materials disposal during construction. The LMWC building was constructed prior to the elimination of asbestos-containing materials, lead-based paints, and polychlorinated biphenyls, yet no analysis has been made of these hazards (or methods to mitigate these potential hazards) upon adjacent residents, churchgoers, senior living facility residents, and/or schoolchildren.
(4) Hydrology and water quality impacts from the developed Project. The church's experts have analyzed the existing site, and the proposed Project at build-out, and determined that the Project's drainage study inaccurately describes the conditions such that considerably more stormwater is expected to flow onto the church property than reported.
(5) Transportation impacts from construction and the developed Project. These impacts include significant numbers of heavy-haul trucks going through Wilson Street (designated a local collector) interrupting regular traffic and parking along the road, as well as church and school pick-ups and drop-offs, and a failure to follow the current standard in traffic analysis under CEQA, namely a vehicle miles traveled (VMT) analysis pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15064.3. And as indicated above, the analysis indicates the dangers inherent in the intersection at Grossmont Boulevard and
Wilson Street.

But for the Project's hydrology and water quality analyses, the church's expert analyses on the remaining impact categories described above remain the only information in the administrative record such that the City cannot simply overlook the described potentially significant impacts. Neither the Project applicant, nor the City itself, have made any attempt to respond to these expert analyses such that CEQA requires that an initial study be prepared. (Hansen Brothers Enterprises, Inc. V. Board of Supervisors (1996) 12 Cal.4th 533, 560 [standing for the proposition that undisputed evidence in the administrative record must be relied upon.].) Until such time as the Project applicant, or the City, rebut the evidence presented by the church's experts, and with respect to certain issues, the testimony, and opinions of laypersons, those remain the only materials upon which the City may rely in determining whether the exemption to CEQA under Guidelines section 15332 may be effective.
Under CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c), "[a] categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." Such an exception to CEQA Guidelines section 15332 exists in the administrative record in light of church's undisputed expert testimony as to impact categories described above. The City may not ignore evidence of an unusual circumstance a creating a reasonable possibility of a significant environmental impact. (Committee to Save the

A. The City May Not Apply The In-Fill Development Exemption In Light Of The Project's Expected, and Known, Potentially Significant Impacts
The City proposes to avoid CEQA review of the Project by employing the In-Fill Development exemption found at CEQA Guidelines section 15332. This exemption provides that in-fill development may avoid CEQA analysis if:
(a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and
regulations. (b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses. (c) The project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened
species. (d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality. (e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.
Our client has secured all Project materials the City purports to have in its possession or control via the California Public Records Act ("CPRA"). In securing this data, it has become readily obvious that very little analysis of the Project's potentially significant impacts to the environment have been performed to date. In fact, the only data in the administrative record analyzing the Project under CEQA has been provided by our client's environmental experts. These analyses, and the records produced pursuant to the above-mentioned CPRA request, indicate that though CityMark submitted an "Environmental Assessment/Initial Study Application" the City has performed no analysis of its own and has no Initial Study to indicate whether further environmental review must occur. Moreover, the expert analyses provided by our client, concretely and definitively specifies potentially significant impacts in the following CEQA
categories:
(1) Air quality impacts arising from construction. This is especially important in that the Project proposes significant grading - "400 cubic yards of excavation (cut) and 1,400 cubic yards of fill... primarily used to raise the rear of the site to establish a pad for the parking area [along with]... [a] retaining wall of up to eight and a half feet in height is planned along the south end of the parking area" - which is directly adjacent to the area
where 125 students currently attend the Warren Walker School, on the church campus. These students are sensitive receptors, spending time outdoors to learn and play, and with open windows, especially during the COVID-19 era, to provide additional ventilation limiting disease spread. (2) Noise impact arising from construction. Again, much like the air impacts category, directly above, but likely to last significantly longer as the construction noise will exist

While the Guidelines provide opportunities for projects to be exempted from CEQA review, these exemptions are limited in nature. "Only those projects having no significant effect on the environment are categorically exempt from CEQA review." (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network, supra, at p. 1102.) A significant effect is a "substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in the environment." (Pub. Res. Code §21068. [Emphasis added.]) This means a that an activity has a significant effect if, among other things, it "has the potential to degrade the quality of the environment." (Pub. Res. Code § 21083.) "[A]n activity that may have § a significant effect on the environment cannot be categorically exempt." (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 124. [Emphasis added.])
The courts review categorical exemptions using strict construction in a manner affording the greatest environmental protection within the reasonable scope of the statutory language. (County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 966.) "[E]xemption categories are not to be expanded or broadened beyond the reasonable scope of their statutory language.* (Dehne v. County of Santa Clara (1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 827, 842.) Thus, an exemption must be applicable in light of the full scope of a project.
A public agency has the burden of proving that substantial evidence supports its factual finding that a project falls within the asserted exemption. (Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose, 54 Cal. App. 4th 106, 114-115 (1997); Magan v. County of Kings (2002) 105 Cal.App.4th 468, 475.) "An agency's duty to provide such factual support 'is all the more important where the record shows ...that opponents of the project have raised arguments regarding possible significant environmental impacts." (Muzzy Ranch Co. v. Solano County Airport Land Use Com. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 372, 386.) A city cannot impose a burden on the public to prove a possibility of adverse environmental impacts since this would frustrate CEQA's fundamental purpose of ensuring that government officials "make decisions with environmental consequences in mind." (Davidon Homes, supra, at p. 116; California Farm Bureau Federation v. California Wildlife Conservation Bd. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 186.) "[T]he agency's exemption determination must be supported by evidence in the record demonstrating that the agency considered possible environmental impacts in reaching its decision." (Davidon Homes, supra, at p. 117; East Peninsula Ed. Council, Inc. v. Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School Dist. (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 155, 171.)
The record before the City, limited as it is because of the lack of analysis performed by CityMark, reveals that the Project's potential effects on the environment make the application of a categorical exemption legally inappropriate. In fact, most of the environmental analysis performed, to date, has been by the church's experts and those analysis have not been challenged, nor apparently analyzed by the City.

PWM587

which has been in place for over half a century and, thus, conflicts directly and inarguably with
this policy.
6) Objective UD-3.1 requires that development be "architecturally and environmentally sensitive and ...compatible with neighboring design and scale.3 As indicated in the discussions regarding Policy LU-1.2.2 and Policy LU-2.1.2 directly above, the Project is unlike anything in this neighborhood, especially with respect to its design and scale, and therefore, conflicts with this objective of the General Plan.
In short, the Project cannot be said to be in harmony with the City's General Plan Land Use and Urban Design Element as proposed. As such, it must be revised significantly to come into conformance with the General Plan, and the surrounding community.

II. The Project Fails To Comply With The California Environmental Quality Act
The primary purposes of CEQA are to inform City decisionmakers, as well as the public, about the potential impacts of a project, and to prescribe mitigation measures to avoid such impacts. CEQA requires a broad view of what constitutes a project requiring environmental analysis. (McQueen v. Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1143.) Even projects that appear benign will likely fall within the ambit of CEQA. (Bloom v. McGurk (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1307, 1312.) The California State Legislature formulated CEQA to "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of the environment shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions.' (Pub. Res. Code §21001(d).) To implement this goal, CEQA requires municipalities to analyze discretionary projects for potential environmental impacts utilizing a three-tier system. (No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 74.) The first tier is known as a preliminary review. The preliminary review requires public agency staff to analyze a complete application in order to discern the full scope of the project at issue. (CEQA Guidelines section 15060(b); City of Pasadena v. The State of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 810, 836.) Once the parameters of the project are established, a determination is made to resolve whether an exemption is applicable to the project. If such an exemption is found, the agency must determine that no exceptions to the exemption are triggered by the potential impacts from the full scope of the project. (CEQA Guidelines §§ 15060, 15061.) If the project is not exempt from CEQA, or an exception is applicable, the second tier of review is required wherein an initial study is prepared because it has been determined that there is a possibility that the project may have a significant effect on the environment. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063.) An initial study facilitates environmental assessment early in the design of a project. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063(c).) In the third tier, the initial study is used to demonstrate that either: a) the project "will not have a significant effect," triggering the preparation of a negative declaration, or b) the project is one "which may have significant effect on the environment," triggering the preparation of an environmental impact report ("EIR"). (CEQA Guidelines § 15064.)

elements." (Resource Defense Fund v. County of Santa Cruz (1982) 133 Cal.App.3rd 800, 806.) CEQA imposes an obligation on La Mesa to assess the Project's consistency with the City's General Plan. (North Coast Rivers Alliance et al. v. Marin Municipal Water District (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 614, 633.) The Project, as designed and proposed, cannot be found to be consistent
with the Land Use and Urban Design Element of the City's General Plan.
By way of example:

1) Policy LU-1.2.2 requires that "[a]s part of the development review process, City departments will review all future development to ensure that safety requirements are met, including building and fire codes, accessibility standards and crime prevention techniques. Yet, as indicated above, the City's failure to ensure that the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street indicates that no such review has been performed (or that, if it has, the requirement to ensure safety has been obviated) such that a dangerous condition not only is permitted to exist, but it is being worsened by increasing the vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the area while also attempting to authorize a large development where a single-story structure currently exists, further reducing sight lines on a dangerous curve in the road. Similarly, the proposed waivers to reduce parking space dimensions and drive aisle widths do not "ensure that safety requirements are met, including building and fire codes, [nor] accessibility standards."
2) Policy LU-2.1.2 requires the City to "[s]upport infill development and subdivision proposals that reinforce neighborhood strengths and benefit neighborhood identity," yet the Project a proposes a development which is so different in character and intensity from any other in the neighborhood, both with respect to its architectural style and the materials used on its exterior walls - none of which can be found elsewhere in this community. Thus, it cannot be said that this Project will "reinforce" the existing visual appeal of the community.
3) Policy LU-2.1.5 requires the implementation of projects in the "Mixed-Use Overlay Zone by promoting the rehabilitation of properties and new development that fits into the context of the existing neighborhoods while meeting the City's Urban Design Objectives for infill development." Again, as noted directly above, in #2, the Project is completely out of character and context with respect to the existing neighborhood such that this policy cannot be met.
4) Policy LU-4.2.3 requires that "[n]ew development shall provide adequate parking." As the Project specifically sceks to not only reduce parking space numbers below the
City's normal standards, it also seeks to reduce the number below those permitted under the State Density Bonus Law (albeit, improperly attempting to do so via a waiver, as indicated in the immediately preceding two sections of this letter). Also, as indicated in the immediately preceding section, the Project does not provide adequate parking not only with respect to the reduced number it of spaces it proposes, but also improperly attempts to reduce the dimensions of the spaces and the drive aisles around them in a manner likely to impact the public's (and future residents') health and safety. Thus, the Project clearly conflicts with this policy as well. 5) Objective UD-1.1 requires the City's "It]o protect La Mesa's existing built environment and cultural heritage." But the Project proposes to destroy the LMWC clubhouse

PWM585

B. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Not Permitted To Overcome Regulations That Pertain To Health And Safety
As mentioned above, the Project's requests for waivers are inapposite to the law because they pertain to financial rather than physical constraints. In addition, the Project improperly seeks to waive the City's standard parking space and driving aisle dimensions even
though this would result in direct health and safety impacts. Waivers are impermissible on this basis as well.

The dimensions of parking spaces and adjacent driving aisles are specified to ensure the safety of vehicles, their drivers and passengers, and pedestrians. (LMMC § 22.112.010(B).) This § makes common sense - if spaces and driving aisles are too small, or otherwise constrained, they are likelier to lead to physical harm from other vehicles when vacating or entering a space and are the reason why State building codes requires minimum parking dimensions to ensure health and
safety. (DAB Staff Report, p. 3 & Attachment D, pp. 3-4; DRB Staff Report, p. 3 & Attachment
E, pp. 3-4.)
Government Code section 65915(e)(1) of the State Density Bonus Law provides:
Nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted to require a local government to waive or reduce development standards if the waiver or reduction would have a specific, adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5, upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact. [Emphasis added.]
Thus, a waiver cannot be used to avoid the specific, adverse impact arising from the reduction of a basic safety feature inherent in parking stall/space sizes and driving aisle
dimensions as contemplated by the Project due to the health and safety issues it raises. No
justification exists which would be sufficient to overcome this requested reduction in health and safety standards, nor would an incentive permit such a thing.
C. The Project, As Designed, Is Contrary To The Chief Land Use Policies Declared Under
The Land Use And Urban Design Element Of The General Plan

California law requires each city and county to adopt a general plan, a comprehensive long-
term plan for the development of that city or county, famously referred to by the state Supreme Court as the "constitution for future development." (Lesher Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut
Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 540.) A general plan must contain seven mandatory "elements," including a "land use element" to designate the level of intensity and general distribution of land uses. (Gov. Code § 65302.) "[T]he propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development depends upon [a finding of] consistency with the applicable gencral plan and its

PWM584

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV

Pursuant to Government Code §65915()(1), waivers (as opposed to incentives) are afforded to a density bonus project only when a "development standard will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of : development," not because the developer desires it, or because it will enhance the financial prospects of project. Put another way, a waiver a permits deviation from, or altogether evasion of, regulations which affect : project due to its site-specific physical features. This subject site has no such physical constraints. Rather, the balconies could be built outside of the pedestrian realm (i.e., within the building envelope) by moving the exterior walls along Grossmont Boulevard back four feet, or removed altogether. The applicant itself makes clear that it is not a physical constraint that drives this waiver request when it states its justification as follows:
This waiver is requested duc to excessive space and cost impacts to incorporate the Open Space requirement and private balconies. The loss of development potential to incorporate this would make the project infeasible to provide the affordable units.
As mentioned above, the site itself does not have any physical obstruction which precludes construction of these balconies, rather CityMark simply desires to have them overhang the pedestrian realm because it would increas their financial incentive to develop the Project. The State Density Bonus Law permits this sort of deviation from regulation for financial gain through the use of incentives, of which the Project has two (waivers, on the other hand, are unlimited for such developments). Yet, the Project avoids using any of its incentives and instead improperly
requests at least five waivers to avoid its open space requirements, building height limit, parking space sizing, landscaping required within the pedestrian realm, and overall parking requirements. In each such instance, CityMark indicates that the justification for the waiver is not a physical constraint unique to the site but rather the request is made to seek a financial boon for the developer.
The reason the Project seeks to use waivers rather than incentives is clear on its face - the State Density Bonus Law does not authorize a sufficient number of incentives (i.e., the Project requires five, but only has two available to it) to meet CityMark's desired financial goals, whereas it may request an unlimited number of waivers. Because it docs not have sufficient incentives to develop the Project in this manner, it attempts to avoid their use altogether and instead make faulty justifications for waivers which are impermissible under the law.
Because CityMark cannot show a physical constraint exists which limits the development of the Project under the City's laws and policies, it must use its incentives (and justify the use of those incentives by showing the financial benefit gained thereby) and/or redesign the Project to be in conformity with the law.

§ 24.18.040(B).) The condition to pay a fee in lieu of an actual mitigation measure regarding a known project impact runs afoul of CEQA and should not be permitted. Rather the Project must be required to perform an analysis to determine the scope of the impact and to then propose a mitigation measure to reduce that impact to a less than significant level.
Moreover, this mitigation measure is improper on two other bases. First, it improperly attempts to defer mitigation until a later (and, in this case, unknown future) time. This is
specifically forbidden under CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4 (a)(1)(B).) And second, a mitigation measure is only available if a project under CEQA is expected to generate a potentially significant impact on the environment, but the staff report indicates that the Project is exempt from CBQA because there are no such expected impacts. (DAB Staff Report, p. 7-8; see also DAB Staff Report, Attachment A, "Resolution No. DAB-2021-xx" at Par. 1.) So, either the Project is not exempt from CEQA and cannot be conditioned to mitigate a potentially significant impact, or it must be analyzed properly under CEQA (i.e., by preparation of an Initial Study, followed by specific impact category studies, and the development of a mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report). The status quo does not comport with the law. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102 [a public agency may not adopt mitigation measures for a project for the purpose of qualifying it for a categorical CEQA exemption; see also Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1200.)
A. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Limited To Overcoming Physical, Not Financial,
Constraints Such That Avoiding Improvements To The Pedestrian Realm Are Not
Permitted For This Project

As indicated above, the Project is designated Mixed Use Urban requiring improvements to
the surrounding pedestrian realm. LMMC § 24.18.020(E) defines the term "pedestrian realm" as
follows:

"Pedestrian realm" means a twelve-foot wide arca located between the face of the
curb of a Circulation Element designated strect and the face of the building. The
pedestrian realm includes the parkway, sidewalk, and landscaped arcas. The
pedestrian realm may include both public and private property where the public right-of-way is not twelve feet wide. Pedestrian amenities, street trees, strect furniture, bus stop facilities, and other landscaping, as specified in this chapter, shall be included in the public realm.
Notwithstanding this acknowledged requirement, "[w]aivers are being requested to allow reductions in... pedestrian realm requirements." (DAB Staff Report, p. 3; DRB Staff Report, p. 3.) For instance, the Project seeks a "waiver" under the State Density Bonus Law so that it may encroach four feet into the pedestrian realm along Grossmont Boulevard by installing balconies hanging over this right of way. This miscomprehends what a waiver is under the law.

The Project sits under 100 feet away, directly across Grossmont Boulevard, from the Grossmont Shopping Center. The closest supermarket to the Project is the Walmart Neighborhood Market therein, lying approximately 350 fect away, yet because there is no crosswalk, stop sign, and/or traffic signal at the intersection of Wilson Street and Grossmont Boulevard, a resident of the Project would be required to walk about three-quarters of a mile to safely cross the street, pick up groceries, and return with them - it is doubtful many residents will be able to lug an average family's weekly groceries this distance, on foot. (DAB Staff Report, p. 2 [In fact, the City recognizes this failing at the beginning of its report, "The intersection is not signalized and is lacking curb ramps and crosswalks."l: see also DRB Staff Report at p. 2 for the same acknowledgment of a dangerous condition].) Notwithstanding this, it appears the Project is being permitted to avoid the development of a crosswalk which is absolutely necessary for its residents or, at least, providing an analysis showing the Project will generate significantly more average daily vehicular trips and vehicle miles traveled than contemplated.
The City failed to require a traffic analysis for the Project, though it initially sought to require an ADA-compliant ramp be constructed at this intersection before apparently dropping this condition altogether. Our client's environmental consultant has also indicated this intersection is particularly dangerous because of limited sightlines arising from a substantial curve in Grossmont Boulevard in this area. The observation that this particular intersection is dangerous has been
voiced numerous times in correspondence submitted to the City by multiple parties. Yet the staff
reports show that no ramp, crosswalk, or analysis was required of the Project- instead, the Project is conditioned to provide a $5,000 "fair-share" payment toward a ramp to be built by an unknown party at an unknown time in the future. This does not comport with the law.

There appears to be no plan on file to develop a safe intersection at Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street, and the $5,000 payment does not appear to go towards any previously approved fund for that purpose. Nor is there any indication of how this figure was calculated. In Anderson First Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173, the appellate court held that paying a "fair-share fee" is permissible as effective mitigation only if the fees are "part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency commits itself to implementing." That is not the case in this instance. In light of this, the City must require the installation of an appropriately signalized intersection, or some other traffic calming feature here, or require the Project to present an analysis indicating why it should not do so. The only evidence in the administrative record, to date, on this topic shows that the City initially desired a crosswalk to be installed but backed off without explanation (or analysis available to the public, or the City's
decisionmakers).

"In MU areas, new development is required to include pedestrian realm improvements along collector streets to encourage pedestrian activity. The Circulation Element classifies Grossmont Boulevard as a major collector street subject to pedestrian realm requirements." (DAB Staff Report, p. 2; DRB Staff Report, p. 2. [Emphasis added.]; see also La Mesa Municipal Code

in light of California Executive Order N-29-20. Yet, the failure to afford the a public a practical opportunity to review, analyze, and respond to the Project's 137-page DRB staff report and the 150-page DAB staff report does not comport with the public's statutory and constitutional rights to petition its government under the Ralph M. Brown Act. (Government Code 54950 et seq.; Cal. Const., Art. I § 3, subd. (a) and (b)(1), (7).) These actions run afoul of the law as they present limitations on public participation which are simply "too arbitrary and capricious, too restrictive and unreasonable." (Nevens v. Chino (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 775, 778; see also Robins v. Pruneyard Shopping Center (1979) 23 Cal.3d 899, 907 [The right of the people to petition the government for redress of grievances is "vital to a basic process in the state's constitutional scheme."].)

Furthermore, should CityMark, or its consultants, be permitted to present audio/visual materials to, or communicate directly with, the DAB or DRB boards during these hearings on March 8, 2021 it will only heighten the inequities inherent in providing late, or no, notice to the public, with regard to the respective rights of the parties to petition their government. This would be an unfortunate, and likely unlawful, action in unequal treatment under both state and federal statutes and constitutions. A more reasoned action would be to postpone each of the DAB and DRB hearings by a week, or more, to permit each party, and the public more generally, an opportunity to present their positions thoughtfully.
Notwithstanding this, we offer a limited summary of our client's position with respect to the proposed Project in the hopes that it will be presented to the DAB and DRB board members for review prior to any discussion of, or determination on, this matter. In light of the severely constrained time available to us before the DAB and DRB meetings, we will not reiterate each of the points made in prior communications and correspondence delivered to the City in opposition to the Project but join in those comments by this reference. Rather, we will focus briefly on the inadequate analysis of the Project in light of the City's General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, the Project's inapt use of California State Density Bonus Law (Gov. Code § 65915 et seq.) waivers, and the impropriety of the claimed CEQA exemption under Guidelines section 15332.

L The Project Runs Afoul Of The General Plan's Urban Design Element And The Zoning Ordinance
As the staff reports to cach of the DAB and DRB indicate, the Project site is designated as "Mixed Use Urban," corresponding to the Mixed Use (MU) Overlay, in the Residential Business base zone and is intended to support "pedestrian friendly housing.' (DAB Staff Report, p. 2; DRB Staff Report, p.2.) Notwithstanding this, the Project seeks to avoid the very features it is obligated to provide to enable pedestrian-friendly housing.

Re: Project No. 2020-16 (CityMark Communities LLC) - 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, CA

Dear Ms. Kinnard:

This law firm represents the St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California located at 5150 Wilson Street, directly adjacent to the La Mesa Woman's Club ("LMWC"), the site of a 49 residential unit and three commercial unit mixed-use project ("Project") proposed by CityMark Communities LLC ("CityMark") known as Project No. 2020-16. This correspondence is offered to inform the City of La Mesa ("City") of our client's grave concerns regarding the proposed Project, the limited conditions recommended to ensure the health and safety of the public, and the apparent lack of analysis of the Project's expected impacts.
We also wish to bring to the City's attention that on December 17, 2020 this firm requested to be placed on the notice list for all public hearings relating to the Project, and specifically those relating to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Notwithstanding this, we were
only sent notice of the March 8, 2021, 12:30 p.m. Design Review Board ("DRB") meeting after regular work hours, at 8:10 p.m., on Thursday, March 4, 2021 (see Attachment "1"), indicating that the City requires audio/visual presentations by the public to be submitted by "12:00 noon, one business day prior to the start of the meeting." It would be practically impossible to prepare and transmit any presentation, let alone a thoughtful one, within three regular working hours of receipt of said notice (i.e., after 9 a.m. on March 5, 2021) to comply with the City's stated deadline. What is more, no notice was sent to this office of the March 8, 2021, 10 a.m. Development Advisory Board ("DAB") meeting though we understand that an exemption to CEQA analysis is to be voted on in this hearing. In fact, it is solely due to our client's diligence in searching the City's website, at approximately 11:15 am on March 5, 2021, that we learned of the DAB meeting at all - again, making it impossible to provide the City with an audio/visual presentation by the 12:00 noon
deadline set for that same day.
We understand that COVID-19 has altered the conditions by which we all live and work, and that the City is permitted to avoid direct communications from the public during such hearings

approval of projects, we strongly recommend the City reconsider its current practices. It docs not appear that the composition of the DAB, nor the Design Review Board, afford any semblance of an impartial determination on matters of great importance to the public. Rather, these bodies appear to act as "rubber-stamps" on staff decisions. At the very least, the Council should consider having a municipal attorney staff each such meeting to protect the City's interests, and those of the community.

the public health, safety of welfare will result." a Such a review specifically calls out the City's
responsibility to use its judgment in deliberating whether to approve the Project's Site Development Plan.

Moreover, Mr. Kusiak's declaration that the Project is "by-right" does not comport with CEQA. CEQA specifically does not apply to ministerial projects. (Public Resources Code § 21080(b).) The very fact that the DAB sought to approve an exemption from CEQA pursuant to Guideline section 15332 indicates that the Project is discretionary in that a CEQA exemption is not applicable to ministerial projects.
CEQA is intended to provide the public, and decisionmakers, with accurate information about the nature and full scope of a development. (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal. App. 3d 185, 192.) Providing inaccurate information, misleading the public, and other decisionmakers, as to their rights to review and analyze the Project is a disservice to the community and discourages thoughtful discussion necessary to shape a discretionary development review. (Id. [an "accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an informative and legally sufficient" review under CEQA.].) The inaccurate description of the Project must be corrected to comply with CEQA.
Similarly, Mr. Kusiak stated that the DAB had no authority to deny the Project's requested waiver under the State Density Bonus Law due to health and safety concerns (raised, largely, with respect to the dangerous traffic-related conditions at the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street). This, too, is an incorrect statement of the law and the scope of the City's authority to review the Project under CEQA. As indicated in our March 8, 2021 letter to the DAB, Government Code section 65915(e)(1) specifically provides that waivers of development standards under the State Density Bonus Law should not be granted when they would result in "specific, adverse impact... upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact." Though the DAB (and the DRB), as well as the City staff report, acknowledge that the Project's waivers result in specific, adverse impacts upon health, safety, and the physical environment without offer of
satisfactory mitigation, due to the claimed exemption from CEQA, with respect to public realm
improvements (resulting in hazardous traffic conditions), parking space size and drive aisle standards (resulting in hazardous traffic and parking conditions), open space standards, landscaping standards, and other deviations from development standards, these waivers were approved due to an inaccurate statement of the law - claiming that the DAB could not deny the waivers under circumstances where specific, adverse impacts to health and safety are expressly acknowledged to exist. In light of this, the Project's waivers must be reconsidered and its impacts on the environment reviewed to determine what mitigation measures may be imposed.
Further, in light of the rampant inaccuracies, misstatements of law, and impropriety of appointing City staff (i.c., the Community Development Director, City Engineer, Building Division Director, and Fire Marshal) to review staff recommendations, and afford discretionary

Making matters worse, Mr. Kusiak, also a Design Review Board member, declared that the traffic report required of the Project would not be prepared until the Applicant provided "construction drawings" for the development - such construction drawings are submitted when seeking building permits, well after the Project's discretionary entitlements have been considered and issued by the City. This, too, runs afoul of CEQA in that mitigation measures, and analyses, studies, and reports required to develop such measures in light of expected environmental impacts may not be deferred. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4(a)(1)(B).)
2) Throughout the DAB hearing, Mr. Kusiak incorrectly declared that the Project was a "by- right" development. A "by-right" development means the Project cannot be reviewed in a discretionary manner but must instead by approved ministerially. This is incorrect and runs afoul of CEQA in that it provides an inaccurate description of the Project likely to mislead the public, and other decisionmakers, as to their rights and the scope of analysis owed the Project under the law.

The California Supreme Court recently opined on this very issue clarifying the difference between discretionary and ministerial projects:
A permit issuance decision can be discretionary or ministerial depending on the circumstances. Those terms are defined in the CEQA Guidelines. A
project is discretionary when an agency is required to exercise judgment or deliberation in deciding whether to approve an activity. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15357.) It is distinguished from a ministerial project, for which the agency merely determines whether applicable statutes, ordinances, regulations, or other fixed standards have been satisfied. (Ibid.) Ministerial projects are those for which "the law requires [an] agency to act ... a in a set way without allowing the agency to use its own judgment...." (CEQA Guidelines, 15002, subd. (i)(1).) They involve "Little or no personal judgment by the public official as to the wisdom or manner of carrying out the project. The
public official merely applies the law to the facts as presented but uses no special discretion or judgment in reaching a decision." (CEQA Guidelines,
ccp 15369.) [Protecting Our Water & Environmental Resources v. County of Stanislaus (2020) 10 Cal.5th 479, 489.1
On its face, the Project requires the approval of a Site Development Plan in light of its MU zoning. (DAB staff report, page 2 ["Entitlement review for new development in the MU zone involves site development plan review by the Development Advisory Board and design review by the Design Review Board, subject to City Council ratification."] The La Mesa Municipal Code, at section 24.02.034, further indicates that the review of a Site Development Plan is a discretionary process subject to approval, approval with conditions or denial, upon determining the project findings to be satisfactory and the City's design objectives are met, to ensure "that no detriment to

Director, Kerry Kusiak's attempt to waive this legal impropriety by arguing that the $5,000 contribution to street improvements is a feature of the Project rather than a condition imposed by the City runs counter to the plain language of the approval the fair-share contribution is "a condition of approval" (staff report, page 5), and "[t]he applicant shall provide a fee in-lieu of $5,000 [sic] for construction of an
ADA compliant curb ramp at the southeast corner of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street" (DAB Resolution No. DAB-2021-xx, at page 4, Engineering Condition of Approval #21).
Moreover, the argument that this $5,000 contribution is a feature of the Project offered by the Applicant, rather than mitigation measure imposed by the City, is patently absurd. The Applicant repeatedly indicates, in its own words, when (improperly) seeking waivers under the State Density Bonus Law, that the Project would be financially infeasible due to "cost impacts" if it were to meet the City's development standards (see staff report, Attachment E, pages 2-5) --so, the Council would have to believe that the Applicant is claiming financial difficulty and simultaneously giving away cash to the City even though it was under no obligation to do so (and that there no Project impact to this intersection dictate the imposition of a mitigation measure). Such efforts to avoid CEQA must be avoided as an affront
to the community this Council and its staff serve.
As further described in our March 8, 2021 (Exhibit "B"), this mitigation measure also runs
afoul of the basic tenet of CEQA jurisprudence that payment into a fair-share fee is only
permissible if the fees are "part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency
commits itself to implementing. (Anderson First Coalition V. City of Anderson (2005) 130
Cal.App.4th 1173, 1187.) There appears to be no such plan, commitment, nor funds to implement,
the construction of a crosswalk across Grossmont Boulevard at Wilson Street, nor any indication as to how the $5,000 condition of approval was determined to result in a "fair-share" of the overall
expense in light of the Project's impacts this is, of course, because there has been no lawful review of the Project's impacts at this intersection in direct violation of CEQA.
The City's Design Review Board, also on March 8, 2021, conditioned the Project's approval on the Applicant's provision of a traffic analysis to prove that the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street was inherently dangerous requiring deviation from the City's standard public realm improvements in the Mixed Use ("MU") zone. This condition indicates that the Applicant specifically seeks a waiver of required development standards due to a hazardous condition to health and safety at this intersection (i.e., by adding numerous new
pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles). Whether the is waiver is granted, or not, the fact remains that the City acknowledges the Project will generate impacts at this intersection requiring review and mitigation measures such that a categorical CEQA exemption may not be approved in light of CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c).

ramps and crosswalks." The Applicant's traffic engineer, during the public comment portion of the DAB hearing, indicated that the Project would install a crosswalk across Grossmont Boulevard. Yet, an examination of the Project plans, as reflected in the staff report, indicates no such street improvements are offered, nor is the City's approval conditioned on the installation of a safe, signalized crosswalk at this intersection - though it is well understood to be a dangerous location in light of the curvature of the street and speed of the automobiles moving through the area. Instead, the staff report, at page 5, provides "[a]s a condition of approval, the applicant will pay a fair-share contribution towards crosswalk improvements to the intersection." Such a mitigation measure is improper in the following respects (beyond those points made in our March 8, 2021 comment letter to the DAB): a. First, the imposition of this condition of approval shows the DAB, and city staff, recognize the intersection requires a crosswalk in light of the Project's addition of 49 households of new residents, and the additional pedestrian traffic expected from the Project's three retail spaces, directly accessing the Grossmont Shopping Center for shopping or parking purposes (the latter especially, in light of the Project's deficient parking space supply). This dangerous condition (i.e., no safe crosswalk, stop signs, or signals) will be heightened by the addition of dozens, if not hundreds, of additional individuals trying to cross Grossmont Boulevard on a daily basis - a clear and unmistakable impact requiring review and mitigation under CEQA. Yet, the DAB approved an exemption from CEQA review declaring that there is no reasonable possibility that a significant impact exists pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c). This determination does not comport with the facts, nor the City's determination that a condition on the Project is required to contribute towards the safety of this intersection. On this basis alone, the DAB's approval of a categorical exemption is without merit. b. Second, the DAB's approval of a fair-share contribution, on its face, indicates that the City expects other neighboring future developments to contribute to the correction of the unsafe conditions at the Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street
intersection due to the foresecable addition of more pedestrians and vehicles due to residential and commercial development in the area. This, too, indicates that the cumulative impact exception found at CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(b) ("All [categorical] exemptions. are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.") applies, such that the DAB could not lawfully approve a categorical CEQA exemption to this Project. c. Third, the imposition of a mitigation measure, such a as a condition requiring a street improvement, or payment of a fair-share contribution toward such an improvement, inherently indicates that the Project is expected to result in a significant impact. In such an instance, no categorical CEQA exemption may be granted. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102.)

Re: Appeal of March 8, 2021 Development Advisory Board Determination Regarding Project No. 2020-16

Dear Ms. Wiegelman:
This correspondence shall serve as a request to appeal the March 8, 2021 City of La Mesa ("City") Development Advisory Board (DAB") approval of the CityMark Communities LLC (*Applicant") development project, and exemption from the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California, also known as Project No. 2020-16 (the
"Project').
Appeal of DAB Determination
Pursuant to La Mesa Municipal Code sections 2.08.051 and 24.02.035, this firm, acting on behalf of its client, St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California ("St. Luke's") located at 5150 Wilson Street, hereby timely appeals the DAB's March 8, 2021 approval of the Project and its exemption from review under CEQA, and attaches a check in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) (a copy of which is presented with the electronic version of the correspondence as Exhibit "A"). As the neighboring property owner representing the interests of its congregation as well as the community at large, St. Luke's files this appeal in light of specific violations of CEQA, the La Mesa Municipal Code, including but not limited to the Project's zoning requirements and concomitant development standards, the California State Density Bonus Law (Government Code § 65915 et seq.), and the City's General Plan as iterated in the letter delivered to the DAB on March 8, 2021 and attached hereto as Exhibit "B."

In addition, certain representations made at the subject DAB hearing indicate that the
Project is further violative of the law. We lay several of these issues out below:
1) In expectation of the Project's residents accessing the Grossmont Shopping Centor directly across Grossmont Boulevard, the City's staff report to the DAB, at page 2, acknowledges that the "intersection [of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street] is not signalized and is lacking curb

under CEQA is impermissible, it fails to comport with its zoning and General Plan requirements
and implements the SDBL in a manner not allowed under the law. In light of these facts, and the

The Project report indicates that the project architect was Herluf Jensen Brydegaard described by Modern San Diego as "[n]ationally recognized for his school designs." (https:/modernsandiego.com/pcople/herluf-jensen-brydegaard).Three of Brydegaard's works were recently represented in a tour of historically significant architectural works in just the Clairemont community of San Diego, including the Clairemont Branch Public Library, the Del Sol Academy, and the George W. Marston Junior High School, all of which have distinctly similar
architectural characteristics to those found at the Clubhouse.
(http://www.sohosandiego.org/tourbooklets/clairemontTour061616.pdf.) And his works are understood to be part of the historical archive kept by the San Diego Historical Society. The Project report clearly offers little insight in that it describes Brydegaard's carcer as "long" - though Brydegaard had a prolific career as acknowledged by the report, he passed away at age 45, in 1960, the same year the Clubhouse was opened. Such an obvious lack of care in the preparation of historical analysis should be offered no weight when faced with the obvious value inherent in the
site.

Further, the report acknowledges that the "La Mesa Women's [sic] Club made many contributions to the betterment of the region" but goes on to say that it no significant events are associated with the history of La Mesa. This runs counter to basic logic in that this service organization in existence since 1902 held meetings for five decades in the Clubhouse where all of their good works and "many contributions" were devised and planned out, but because little research was performed (or disclosed) the report declares no historical value should be assigned to the Clubhouse, and that no individuals important in local history are associated with the site. In short, the report is clearly lacking in objectivity and intended to permit the demolition of a historically important feature of the La Mesa community.
To that end, the Church has hired its own historical expert, Kiley Wallace, who has indicated that the Clubhouse does, in fact, have historical value as to its architectural features similar to others he has promoted successfully for designation in the San Diego County region. Mr. Wallace will provide further details on this in his own correspondence and will review the site for nomination for historical designation.
In light of these facts, the City must require further analysis under LMMC Title 25 to determine the historic nature of the Clubhouse and to determine whether it may be demolished at all. This further portends that the SDBL may not be applicable to the Project in that historically designated sites may not be afforded waivers or incentives by law. (Gov. Code §§ 65915(d)(1)(B), 65915(e)(1).)

Conclusion

The Project, as proposed and previously approved by the void determination made by defunct, must be sent back for further revision in compliance with local and state law. On its face, the Project will generate potentially significant impacts on the environment such that an exemption

afforded to the Project when a "development standard will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development." (Gov. Code § 65915(e)(1).) Notwithstanding this, the Project proposes, and the DAB approved, the encroachment of balconies into the pedestrian realm because of "cost impacts [necessary] to incorporate the Open Space requirement and private balconies." This waiver request is clearly impermissible as it does not pertain to physical site limitations precluding construction but is instead merely tied to the development's potential profitability. Thus, the proposal is in violation of the SDBL and must all similar waivers must be stricken from the Project.
Nor may a development use the SDBL to overcome health and safety requirements imposed under the LMMC. Yet, that is precisely what the Project proposes, and what the DAB approved in permitting reductions in standard parking space and drive aisle dimensions though there can be no doubt that such cutbacks will endanger life and property by increasing the likelihood and frequency of car accidents. The City's parking space and drive aisle requirements are not randomly devised, but rather carefully determined to afford the public safe conditions within parking facilities. (LMMC 22.112.010(B).) To reduce such safety conditions under the guise of an SDBL waiver runs directly counter to the law. co (Gov. Code § 65915(e)(1) [Nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted to require a local government to waive or reduce development standards if the waiver or reduction would have a specific, adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5, upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact.] Emphasis added.) Given this, the Project cannot be approved as proposed in light of the immediate health and safety impacts raised by its reductions in standards attendant to the protection of the public.

Further, the DAB blatantly disregarded the facts that its members, and City staff, knew to be true, that the Clubhouse is a historically important site in the region for a number of reasons. (Exhibits 6-8 [Emails from Planner Allyson Kinnard, Community Development Director Kusiak, and (then-assistant) City Manager Greg Humora, each imparting the significance of the Clubhouse, as well as the need for CEQA review, if not the preparation of an environmental impact report, to permit its modification].) Simply speaking, the Clubhouse is a historically important site due to its distinctive architecture, the well-known and respected architect that designed and oversaw its construction, and the La Mesa Woman's Club's many, extensive contributions to the City of La Mesa and the region - likely meeting three of the four criteria for historical designation under State law, and up to six of eight criteria for designation under the LMMC. (Public Resources Code § 5024.1; LMMC § 25.03.010(A thru F).) The Project's historical report (Historical Resource Assessment in Support of the CityMark Mixed-Use Development Project, La Mesa, San Diego County, California, dated August 19, 2020) is clearly deficient and appears to be directly intended to give the impression that the site should not be considered historic notwithstanding the facts.

any such development - namely, the installation of a crosswalk, curb ramps, and signalization of the intersection of the heavily-trafficked Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street. The replacement of the Clubhouse, which saw infrequent trips to and from the site, with forty-nine (49) residential and three (3) commercial units necessarily an already over-used intersection, making it more dangerous individuals seeking to reach public transportation, or the grocery and shopping center just across Grossmont Boulevard. Though the City is aware of these shortcomings, and the inadequacy of the existing road features, it neither required a traffic study nor institution of the improvements already required within the Circulation Element of the General Plan. Unless this Project is required to make these improvements, no other mechanism exists to fulfill the City's
plans.
Backing this up, the Church has submitted its own expert analysis from Wood Environmental, dated November 9, 2020, indicating that the City improperly failed to evaluate the Vehicle Miles Traveled associated with the Project, as required by the State of California's Office of Planning and Research Technical Advisory on Evaluating Transportation Impacts under CEQA and pursuant to Senate Bill 743. Wood Environmental also notes that the City has not required the evaluation of "potential geometric hazards such as sharp turns, dangerous intersections, or points of vehicle/pedestrian traffic conflicts associated with the proposed site plan." Notwithstanding this, the City knows the area to be hazardous as it has multiple reports of head- on and fixed object collisions at this location. This exacerbation of existing dangerous conditions is not only unconscionable, but it also runs counter to the law in that the Project was afforded an exemption from CEQA when it quite clearly will create significant impacts on the neighboring roadway and must be made to mitigate such impacts.
Instead, the City staff attempt to foist a meager $5,000 fair-share contribution for roadway improvements on the Project. But such a mitigation measure cannot be lawfully placed on development purportedly exempt from CEQA review - the logic being that a development which is exempt from CEQA cannot be said to generate potentially significant impacts and, therefore, may not be required to provide mitigation where no impacts exist. (Anderson First Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173 1186-87.) Though the City appears to understand this conundrum, in its desire to offer an exemption from review, the City nevertheless elected to suggest that the fair share condition be imposed on the development in violation of CEQA. (See, Exhibit "5" - Communications from Community Development Director Kerry Kusiak.) This blatant violation of CEQA must be corrected by upholding the appeal, denying the CEQA exemption recommended by City staff, and requiring a complete and unbiased analysis of the Project's traffic impacts so that appropriate mitigation measures may be instituted. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102.)
The City also uses SDBL waivers in a manner that does not comport with the law in attempting to permit the Project the right to avoid compliance with the LMMC's requirements for the pedestrian realm. (LMMC § 24.18.020(E).) As mentioned previously, a waiver may only be

City Ordinance approved on or about June 8, 2021 dissolving the DA J) Notwithstanding this, the City Council has yet to offer an acknowledgment of the alleged Brown Act violations detailed in the Demand, nor taken steps to unwind the violative actions taken by the DAB. (Gov. Code § 54960.2(a)(4).)
Nor has the City followed through in rehearing the Project under its new SDP review process, as indicated would be done (See Exhibit "3" at p. DA 2, wherein Mr. Sabine wrote to the undersigned, "…City staff would be happy to "redo" the March 8, 2021 DAB hearing on the development project planned at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California.") Instead, the
City has moved the Project "forward" in presenting the matter to the Planning Commission in direct contradiction to any cognizable notion that the City had cured the Brown Act violations it acknowledged existed with respect to the DAB.
Now, the Commission is faced with the unenviable task of reviewing an invalid, and unsupportable, determination by a defunct body. Rather than following the basic mandates of the law, and taking proactive steps to correct these violations, the City appears ready to compound its unlawful actions and lay the problem at the Commission's feet. The Church strongly recommends the Commission reject the review of this Project out of hand, uphold the appeal, and demand the City staff conform with its own municipal code requirements, the Brown Act, and CEQA. A
rescission of the DAB's approval of the Project, including its CEQA exemption, is required under the law, and will only serve to save the City, and thereby its taxpayers, the unnecessary expense of having the Court order this very thing.

The Project, As Posed, Is In Violation Of The California Environmental Quality Act And
Does Not Comply With The California State Density Bonus Law Requiring This Appeal Be
Upheld

As described above, the Project seeks to use the SDBL to demolish the Clubhouse and
construct a mixed-use development in its place. In doing so, the Project must comply not only with the SDBL, but with CEQA, the LMMC, and the City's General Plan, Zoning Ordinance and all applicable zoning overlays. In all of these regards, the Project fails.
The subject site is zoned Residential Business and located within the Mixed Use (MU) Overlay. Though mixed use developments are to be expected on such sites, this zoning requires the Project to provide pedestrian friendly housing. (LMMC § 24.18.010(B)(4).) The SDBL does not authorize waivers from such requirements unless physical constraint exists within the site which would not permit such development. And though there is no such physical constraint, the Project was approved by the DAB to avoid making the improvements which would be required of

1 The Church has not determined whether the actions taken by the City in dissolving the DAB, or in revising the methodology by which an SDP, and this Project, must now be reviewed, comport with the law. Therefore, the Church reserves its consideration of the adequacy of these actions for the time being.

Brown Act and CEQA. (Gov. Code § 54954.1; Cal. Code Regs. tit. 14 ["CEQA Guidelines"] § 15087(a)(3).) Though no technical, or other physical, limitation existed, the DAB unlawfully prohibited the public's right to participate in the hearing waiving any right to public oral comments - yet, the DAB authorized the applicant to make an extended audio and visual presentation and held over an hour's worth of back-and-forth communications with the applicant and its consultants in assessing the Project. Upon conclusion, the DAB granted approval of the requested SDP and CEQA exemption. This is further detailed in our March 16, 2021 letter of appeal (the "Appeal"), attached hereto as Exhibit "1." The substantive and procedural points shortcomings of the Project
described therein are incorporated in full.
Thereafter, on April 7, 2021, this firm delivered to the City a Demand for Cure and Correction (the "Demand") pursuant to the Brown Act to request the unwinding of the DAB's unlawful actions - a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit "2." The procedural shortcomings of the Project described therein are incorporated in full.
In short, the Demand alleges, amongst other things, that the DAB itself was improperly composed in that its members are senior City staff who serially, or directly, communicated about the Project (and other development proposals), informing one another as to their intent to grant approval, and the conditions of such approval, outside of open, public meetings in violation of basic tenets of open government. (See, e.g., Gov. Code 54952.2(b) ["A majority of the members of a legislative body shall not, outside meeting authorized by this chapter, use a series of communications of any kind, directly or through intermediaries, to discuss, deliberate, or take action on any item of business that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the legislative
body."].)
City Attorney Glenn Sabine, in conference with Community Development Director Kerry Kusiak, and City Manager Greg Humora, acknowledged that Brown Act violations likely existed, just as the Church claimed. (See Exhibit "3" communications between Mr. Sabine and the
undersigned acknowledging the DAB's Brown Act violations.) Notwithstanding Messrs. Sabine, Kusiak, and Humora stated intention to request the DAB be terminated, the City Council failed to cure the alleged violations within the statutory thirty (30) day period afforded for such actions, nor offered "an unconditional commitment to cease, desist from, and not repeat the past action" as is required by law to avoid such litigation. (Gov. Code §§ 54960.1(c), 54960.2(a)(4).)
On or about May 24, 2021, the Church filed litigation with the San Diego Superior Court detailing the DAB's violations under the Brown Act and the LMMC. Attached as Exhibit "4" is the subject Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint filed with the Court. Thereafter, the City Council dissolved the DAB - though it again, failing to offer any indication that it had made an unconditional commitment as to the other allegations made within the Demand.

Re: Appeal of Development Advisory Board Determination (Project No. 2020-16, 5220 Wilson
Street, La Mesa, CA)

Dear Ms. Kinnard:

As you know, this firm filed a timely appeal of the now-defunct Development Advisory Board's ("DAB") March 8, 2021 approval of Project No. 2020-16 and grant of California environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") exemption (collectively, the "Project") on behalf of St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California ("Church"). That appeal is the subject of the July 21, 2021 hearing before the City of La Mesa ("City") Planning Commission ("Commission"). This correspondence shall serve to further explain the procedural and substantive shortcomings inherent in the DAB's actions and the Project itself, and why the Commission must, by law, approve our
client's appeal.

The Approval Of The Project Is Void On Its Face and Must Be Rescinded Due To The
Development Advisory Board's Procedural Deficiencies Resulting In Its Dissolution

The Project seeks a Sitc Development Permit ("SDP") and an exemption from CEQA to demolish the La Mesa Woman's Club facilities (the "Clubhouse") at 5220 Wilson Street and construct a nearly 50 foot tall mixed use development consisting of 49 residential apartments and
3 retail spaces. To attain this intensity of use, the Project employs the State Density Bonus Law ("SDBL"; Gov. Code § 65915 et seq.) to deviate from the standard development requirements of the La Mesa Municipal Code ("LMMC"). Yet, the City is not permitted to deviate from the procedural requirements set forth in the Ralph M. Brown Act (the "Brown Act"), CEQA, and the LMMC, to grant approval for the Project. Below is a brief explanation, highlighting some of the unlawful actions taken by the City through the DAB, ultimately resulting in the body's dissolution specifically duc to its approval of the Project.
Though the Church abuts the Clubhouse, and this firm specifically requested notice of all public hearings relating to the Project, the City failed to afford legal notice in violation of the

Roger,
I just left you a voicemail, but I thought I would email this information to you.
The lot is zoned RB-D-MU (residential business-urban design overlay-mixed use overlay)
You had expressed interest in purchasing the parcel and using it for employee parking.
In reviewing the municipal code for zoning:
(RB Zoning) Section 24.05.020 C.1.
Accessory parking to an adjacent business may be permitted if the business is either adjacent to or is
on the opposite side of the street with a Conditional Use Permit.
Therefore, you could use this parcel as an employee parking lot if you obtained a Conditional Use
Permit.
Conditional Use Permits are approved by the planning commission. Properties within 300 feet of the
proposed use would be notified during the process,
(MU Overlay) Section 24.18.030
Requires Conditional Use Permit for parking lots within the mixed use overlay zone. Also, the mixed
use overlay zone requires a 12-foot pedestrian realm (sidewalk and landscaping setback) along the
street frontage of the property. The pedestrian zone may have to be constructed.
The same Conditional Use Permit above would be used to satisfy this requirement.
Parking (24.04.040)
If this parking lot will be used to satisfy the "required" parking for your employees then there needs
to be a traversable pedestrian route within 300 feet.
Iam not sure that this parking lot is "required" at this point.
The building at 5220 Wilson Street appears to be 50 years old and may have historical significance. It
has been the home of the La Mesa Women's Club and may have been designed by a notable
architect. Therefore, you will likely need to conduct a cultural resources study and potentially an
Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the building if you intend to demolish it. If you intent to demo
the building you may have to demonstrate that there are environmental "overriding considerations"
that require the building to be demolished.
Please email or call with questions. Thank you.
I hope the rain holds off on Sunday!

Automobile sales are allowed in the C zone with approval of a site development plan.
Automobile storage of new vehicles is allowed in the C zone for a limited duration of 18
months with approval of a conditional use permit. The property is currently zoned RB-D-MU.
While the base RB zone does not allow these uses, the MU overlay does allow a car sales use on the property with approval of a conditional use permit in a mixed-use development, but does not allow car storage.
Sales: Car sales could be allowed in a mixed-use development with approval of a conditional
use permit. It would also be possible to change the zoning to C, in which case auto sales is
allowed with approval of a site development plan - this would be the best path if they do
not want mixed-use.
Storage: For vehicle storage of no longer than 18 months duration, the zoning would need to
be changed to C and a conditional use permit approved. This would be a more difficult path
and would only provide short time frame for auto storage.

Yes, conditional use permit and pedestrian realm required. Building is almost certainly historically
significant based on the use by a longstanding community organization and the architect, whom is

The La Mesa Women's Club site is zoned RB, which does allow, by
CUP, parking as an accessory use to adjacent/across the street
commercial uses. With a use permit, the project would be subject to
CEQA. Although additional research is needed, it does appear likely
that there would be cultural resource impacts. This could prove
problematic as demolition is generally not mitigable under CEQA.
According to Images of America: La Mesa (Newland, 2010), the La
Mesa Women's Club is the oldest community civic organization in La
Mesa, formed in 1902. The building has served as the group's
headquarters since 1959. The architect, Herluf Brydegaard, designed
number of notable midcentury civic and commercial buildings,
some in collaboration with Lloyd Ruocco. The Women's Club building
maintains its original integrity and would likely be eligible as a
historic landmark under multiple criteria.

Identifying Features
Low-picched gabled roof (sometimes Hat) with widely overhanging caves; roof beams commonly exposed; windows generally present in gable ends (or just below roof line in non-gabled facades); built with nacural materials (wood, stone, brick, or occasionally concrete block); broad expanse of uninterrupted wall surface typically on front facade; entry door may be recessed or obscured; asymmetrical.

Principal Subtypes
Five principal subtypes can be distinguished:2
FRONT-GABLED ROOF-This subtype includes a broad range of simple front-gabled forms. These are ideal for showing off triangular gable-end windows chat indicate t high "vaulted" ceiling inside. Two variations are common: a broad one-story form with a very low-pitched roof (popularized by California developer Joseph Eichler) and an asymmet- rical gable front often found on Split-Level houses (nicknamed the "wounded dove").43
SIDE-GABLED ROOF-The lcast common of the gabled forms, this subtype is more
often found in later examples.
GABLED-ROOF VARIATIONS-Most commonly this subrype consists of a front- gabled roof with a side-gabled extension, Other combinations include houses with tWo wings or two front-facing gables. From the street it is sometimes difficult to discern the
roof form of low side wings.
FLAT ROOF-This subtype includes flat-roof variations; chese have long, continuous
broad roof overhangs, and exposed roof beams that differentiate them from contempo-
raneous Internacional-style houses. Some have shallow horizontal windows located just below the roof line, sometimes set in the space between roof beams.

Members of the La Mesa Planning Commission,

My name is Kiley Wallace and I am a local architectural historian. I exceed the Secretary of Interior's
Standards as an architectural historian and I am an appointed current member and past vice chair of the
County of San Diego's Historic Sites Board.
I recently conducted research and a site visit of the La Mesa Woman's Club at 5220 Wilson Street. Based
on this research and analysis, it is my professional opinion that the building qualifies as a historic
resource at the state and local level for representing and embodying an excellent example of the Mid-
Century Modern Contemporary architectural style, specifically the rare butterfly roof variant or substyle. Thus, a valid and unbiased claim of a no potential impact to a historic resource cannot objectively be
made. This is in addition to potential historic qualifications under other criteria which requires more in-
depth research
The building was identified in 2019 in by La Mesa historic and other city staff as likely qualifying as a
historic resource eligible for designation. In addition to my letter, you have correspondence from a
qualified historic architect and l.a Mesa resident, current San Diego Historic Resources Board member
as well as many other qualified professionals confirming this analysis and conclusion.
The historical Resources Assessment Report in Support of Citymark dated August 19, 2020 does not
appear to be objective in its analysis and is incomplete, missing key research and analysis including a
thorough search for historical photos which are provided below. The 2020 report provides conclusions
with little or no research background or basis. It also appears the development project had minimal
public outreach.
Specifically, alterations to the building are very limited and do not impair the key character defining
features of the structure. Despite the small rear addition and some minor window changes within the
original openings, the structure maintains a high level of architectural integrity. Please see attachments
below.

I urge the La Mesa Planning Commission to deny the developer's claim of no impact to a potentially
eligible historical resource under CEQA and request a thorough objective report from a qualified
consultant to allow for a thorough analysis of the building under the historical criteria.
Sincerely,
Kelay uillato

must be no impact to a potentially eligible historic resource. What support was provided to make the
determination of ineligibility? Only a flawed and incomplete report made by the developer's consultant.
I urge the Commission to request that a complete report be provided by an unbiased third party who is
a qualified architectural historian and is able to properly and fairly asses this resource. Should that prove
too challenging, I urge the Commission to send the evaluation to the City's Historic Preservation
Commission where a transparent, review and public comment can take place.

RE: La Mesa Women's Club - CityMark Mixed Use Development Project

Mayor Arapostathis, Councilmembers and Commissioners

I urge you to take the time to ask questions and to holistically consider the historic eligibility of the La
Mesa Women's Club (LMWC) at 5220 Wilson St. Over the past several years the City of La Mesa has
routinely failed to properly consider its historic resources as required under the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The case of the LMWC is no different. After reviewing the
consultant's report it is clear that the report is flawed and incomplete. It does not adequately asses the
eligibility of this resource.
Based on the City of La Mesa's own criteria for eligibility the LMWC qualifies under at least three separate criteria. It is significant under Criterion A, as the second location for the La Mesa Women's Club. The building likely qualifies due to its association with persons and/or events significant to local history. This can be easily established based on the contents of the report. However, it is equally important to note how little the report says about the membership and specific activities of the LMWC.
No support is provided by the developer's consultant to explain how or why the resource isn't eligible
under this criterion. There are no membership rosters that would potentially identify significant figures,
no research into easily available archives that would highlight significant events. Just an unsupported
conclusion provided by the developer's consultant.
Also qualifying under Criterion B and C the LMWC is exemplary of the contemporary substyle of modern architecture for its extant butterfly roof, original character defining features including, exposed beams,
brick work and bands of fixed and sliding windows. Further, it is the notable work of acclaimed architect
Herluf Brydegaard. In addition to the LMWC Brydegaard was the design architect for several progressive commercial, educational and residential designs throughout San Diego County. Notably absent in the
developer's historic is report is the City of San Diego's historic designation of Brydegaard's commission for
Dr. and Mrs. J. L Feldman.

As has been common practice, City staff has put this item before the Planning Commission indicating that the project qualifies for an environmental exception under CEQA. To qualify for an exemption there

Brydegaard represented in its Mid-Century landscape, especially with such a short career, and this should be analyzed within an updated report. https://www.modernsandiego.com/people/herluf-jensen-brydegaard
SOHO continues to express concern for La Mesa's review process of potentially historic resources, as it relates to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the existing historical inventory. The current review process did not properly evaluate environmental impacts of the Drew Roundhouse/Penske Ford Automotive, 8970 La Mesa Boulevard, or the Ruocco-designed commercial façade remodel at 8371 La Mesa Boulevard. Updating this important planning component to follow best practices is in the interests of ALL stakeholders for a streamlined and transparent review as well as a fair process. Since decisions for potential historical properties is a discretionary and not a ministerial decision, La Mesa must comply with CEQA when making these decisions. For this reason, SOHO continues to suggest better utilizing the Historic Preservation Commission, who should opine on potential historical resources prior to a project
being approved.
In conclusion, SOHO finds the La Mesa Women's Club at 5220 Wilson Street significant under Criteria A, C, and D and the report poor in its analysis of these three criteria, which should be updated prior to any action on this project. SOHO still has concern that the CEQA process is not being adequately followed, and recommends prioritizing an update to the historical review process to be compliant with CEQA and making best use of the HPC. SOHO continues to offer our policy expertise and we look forward to participating in the public process around the CEQA process.

Re: 5220 Wilson St, La Mesa Women's Club - Citymark Mixed-Use Development Project
Mayor Arapostathis, Councilmembers, and Planning Commissioners,
Save Our Heritage Organisation (SOHO) has reviewed the Historical Resource Assessment Report regarding the La Mesa Women's Club at 5220 Wilson Street. Disagreeing with the report's conclusion, SOHO finds the report deficient in its analysis and the resource to be significant under La Mesa's Historic Designation Criteria A, C and D (Code Section 25.03.010). This project and its historic report further illustrate the need to update the City's Historic Preservation Ordinance and inventory, which will provide transparency to all stakeholders, ensure CEQA compliance, and streamline development.
Significant under Criterion A, as the second location for the La Mesa Women's Club, this Contemporary style resource reflects the growth, success, and dedication of this important local organization, which is still in existence today. Established in 1902 and a special element of the City's cultural, social, political and architectural history; this 100+ year old organization created the Friends of the La Mesa library, which eventually formed the first local library, and even housed the first library in their clubhouse. Other accomplishments include social welfare efforts, municipal incorporation campaigns, and World War l support. Any changes to the building should also be evaluated within the social significance of the club. The growth and accomplishments of the Women's Club should be analyzed within the larger context of La Mesa's development and its local clubs and organizations.
Significant under Criterion C, this c. 1959 resource embodies the Modern Contemporary style and is designed by Herluf Brydegaard for the La Mesa Women's Club. Character-defining features include the rectangular plan with butterfly roof, boxed eaves and exposed beams, bands of fixed and sliding metal windows, vertical wood and brick exterior, and more. Although some windows have been replaced, their original openings do remain, while the western addition and removable HVAC units do not impact integrity. Further, the report's assertion this is a "common and unremarkable example" is irrelevant and cannot be considered under the evaluation criteria. SOHO asserts that due to the architectural detail, level of integrity, and Contemporary style, this resource warrants designation for excellent architecture.
Last, this resource should be evaluated as the notable work of potential Master Architect Herluf Brydegaard, under Criterion D, and considered within La Mesa's collection of Mid Century architecture. Highlighted on the Modern San Diego website, it notes he passed in 1960 at the young age of 45, but "was here long enough to leave a legacy of designs and mentorship." This resource could be the last of Brydegaard that was constructed during his career and should be understood within any other known works in La Mesa. The designer for Clairemont's first elementary school and known as an innovator in modern
school design, Brydegaard was recognized for "efficiency and economy." La Mesa is fortunate to have

activities is unknown without additional environmental analysis and provision of construction management
plan and BMPs enforceable by the City or other regulators. Following the completion of construction, changes to the existing drainage system and impacts to hydrology and water quality are also uncertain without additional study. Therefore, pursuant to CEQA Guidelines §15300.2(c), the City cannot reasonably conclude that the proposed Project would not "have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." As such,
it is recommended that the Applicant prepare a CEQA-compliant IS to further evaluate potential impacts related
to air quality, hazards and hazardous materials, noise, hydrology and water quality, and transportation.
Importantly, mitigation measures should be developed, as necessary, to eliminate or reduce to the maximum
extent practicable the potential impacts that would be experienced by sensitive receptors in the immediate
Project vicinity. These mitigation measures should be identified and tracked by City using a Mitigation
Monitoring and Reporting Program pursuant to CEQA Guidelines §15097.

north and Wilson Street to the east. Grossmont Boulevard travels east to west and spans approximately 65 feet in width. In the Project vicinity, Grossmont Boulevard includes: two west-bound lanes, one of which merges into a right-turn lane, providing access to a large commercial district that includes retail stores and car dealerships; and two east-bound lanes, and a center left-turn lane. Grossmont Boulevard is lined with bike lanes, sidewalks, streetlights, and landscaping and in the vicinity of the Project site, primarily provides access to the adjacent commercial districts. No parking is available along Grossmont Boulevard. Wilson Street is an undivided roadway, spanning approximately 600 feet in length and 40
feet in width, providing north and south access. Wilson Street is lined with a parking lane, sidewalks, and landscaping. Wilson Street primarily serves as a connecting roadway between Grossmont Boulevard and La Mesa Boulevard and provides access to properties located along Wilson Street.
Implementation of the proposed Project would increase short- and long-term traffic volume in the Project vicinity. Traffic impacts related to the construction phase of the proposed Project would involve the ingress and egress of heavy-haul trucks delivering construction materials and removing demolition debris, increased traffic and parking demand related to worker commutes, and potential street closures related to material and equipment staging areas, deliveries, loading and unloading areas, and parking areas. In particular, ingress and egress of heavy-haul trucks during Church services, school pick-up and drop-off, or other periods of high pedestrian activities could result in pedestrian-vehicle safety conflicts. The Applicant should prepare construction management plan that identifies measures to avoid or minimize potential hazards to pedestrian safety such as designated truck routes for the transport of materials, points of entry and egress, material and equipment staging areas, loading and unloading areas, and parking areas. The construction management plan should also describe restrictions on construction timing to avoid periods of high pedestrian activities as well as other traffic control measures (e.g., construction flaggers) necessary to minimize risks to pedestrian safety.
Following the completion of construction activities, long-term traffic in the Project vicinity would increase with the addition of 49 new residential units and associated surface and sub-surface parking
spaces. While the Applicant has provided ADT and peak-hour traffic estimates following the completion of the proposed Project, the Applicant has not addressed to what extent the proposed Project would increase VMT, required in order to address CEQA Guidelines Section 15064.3.
Regarding geometric issues, Wilson Street intersects with Grossmont Boulevard on the leeward side of a convex curve, which makes seeing oncoming traffic from the west (i.e., the left) very difficult when turning right, but particularly so when turning left across two lanes of oncoming traffic. The scale of the proposed development, which includes providing a 7-foot sidewalk width / setback between building and curb, could further reduce visibility and increase hazards for motorists as well as pedestrians and
cyclists. The City has stipulated that the setback along Grossmont Boulevard should be 12 feet. The Applicant should acknowledge this and provide an analysis to demonstrate that there is adequate visibility for vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians at the intersection of Wilson Street and Grossmont
Boulevard.

Recommendations

The Project site is located in close proximity adjacent St. Luke's Lutheran Church which operates as a place of worship on Sunday mornings and Wednesday nights, operates a Sunday school for children and adults, and leases property for a PK-5 school. Additionally, the Project site is located in close proximity to a senior living residential apartment complex to the southeast. Due to the location of the Project site and the nature of the proposed demolition and construction activities, nearby sensitive receptors could be exposed to criteria air pollutants, release of hazardous materials, noise disturbances, and potential pedestrian-vehicle safety conflicts related to the operation of heavy machinery. The potential for significant adverse impacts to occur from these

and that all construction workers that come in contact with hazardous materials wear appropriate
protective equipment (e.g., respirators, googles, protective clothing, gloves, etc.).

Hydrology and Water Quality Impacts: The Project site is fully developed and areas not supporting
existing structures are paved with a surface parking lot. Construction of the proposed four-story, mixed- use development, surface parking lot, and sub-surface parking area would involve grading, excavation, and other ground disturbing activities and alter the existing impermeable surface setting. Without appropriate containment measures, demolition and excavation activities could create potential for pollution runoff of oils, fuels, and other contaminants. The Applicant prepared a drainage study which concluded the proposed Project's drainage and treatment system would have the capacity to convey a 100-year, 6-hour storm event, as well as a storm water quality management plan, which included
stormwater controls and BMPs that would put be implemented to prevent substantial quantities of
polluted stormwater runoff during construction and operation of the proposed Project. Pre- and Post-
Development Hydrology is depicted in Appendix C of the drainage study.

The Applicant responded to the City's comments on the drainage study stating, "[tlhe project is expected
to reduce the amount of runoff currently leaving the site by approximately 0.22 CFS. As a result, we do not anticipate any adverse impacts from the runoff discharging into the driveway to the south." However, this reply does not dispute that storm water runoff will flow along the driveway to the storm drain system
and does not acknowledge the impact that this runoff will have on the Church's drainage.

The Applicant-prepared drainage study estimates that 50% of runoff is discharged at Drainage Basin A.1
POC 1 (southwest corner) and 50% of runoff is discharged at Drainage Basin A.2 / POC 2 (southeast
corner). The Church prepared a separate, analysis "St. Luke's Hydrology Survey Map Overlay and
Photographs" which shows:

O At least two-thirds of the runoff from the Project site currently leaves the site via a drain on the southeast corner of the property.
0 All the runoff from the southwest corner of the Project site flows across the driveway, onto the Church's property, and into the Church's drain system.
These observations represent potential conflicts with California Drainage Law, which must be addressed by the proposed Project, California Drainage Law is through which the courts have established the following general principles, which apply in general to development projects:
O The upstream property owner shall not concentrate water where it was not concentrated
before without making proper provision for its disposal without damage to the downstream
property owner.
O The upstream property owner may reasonably increase drainage runoff by paving or construction of other impervious surfaces, including buildings, without liability. The upstream
property owner may not further increase drainage runoff by diversion of water that previously drained to another area. Reasonableness is often based on prevailing standards of practice in
the community or region.

O No property owner shall block, OI permit to be blocked, any drainage channel, ditch, or pipe.
No property owner shall divert drainage water without properly providing for its disposal.

Without additional thorough investigation of the pre-development conditions, it is not possible to
accurately assess drainage flows and effects to adjacent properties that would result from the proposed
Project.

Transportation Impacts: Local streets bordering the Project site include Grossmont Boulevard to the

Hazards and Hazardous Materials Impacts: The
LMWC building was constructed in the late 1950s and may contain hazardous materials commonly used in building materials prior to 1978, including
asbestos-containing materials (ACM), lead-based
paint (LBP), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). However, despite the age of the structure, the Applicant has neither provided surveys determining the presence or absence of ACM, LBP, and PCBs, nor
prepared a construction management plan detailing
proper procedures and preventive measures that would be implemented to prevent adverse impacts The Church provides Sunday school services and leases

for insulation, as well as in friction and heat-resistant
products. The use and manufacturing of ACM declined in the late 1970s as its adverse health effects were becoming more widely known; however, buildings constructed before or during this period may still contain ACM. Asbestos release can occur when ACM is disturbed by cutting, sanding, or other remodeling activities. Improper attempts to remove ACM can release asbestos fibers into the air,
increasing asbestos levels and affecting human respiratory health.

Lead is a recognized harmful environmental pollutant exposed through air, drinking water, food, contaminated soil, deteriorating paint, and dust. Before the dangers of lead were documented, it was widely used in paint. In 1978, the State of California banned the use of LBP; however, older buildings
constructed prior to 1978 may still contain LBP. If improperly removed from surfaces by dry scraping or sanding, LBP can be absorbed into the body and could pose a public health risk.
PCBs are a group of man-made compounds that were widely used in the past, mainly in electrical equipment, but which were banned at the end of the 1970s in many countries because of environmental concerns related to an increased risk of cancers of the digestive system, the liver, and
the skin, and adverse effects on human reproduction.

If present, construction workers and/or members of the public could be exposed to these hazardous materials during demolition of the existing LMWC building and subsequent hauling of construction debris. If not properly abated, the accidental release of asbestos and/or lead could pose a hazard to the environment and public health, including nearby sensitive receptors. To date, the Applicant has neither conducted surveys confirming the presence or absence of these hazardous materials nor provided a construction management plan describing measures to avoid adverse impacts to the surrounding environment, if encountered. Therefore, the presence of hazards and hazardous materials and the potential for release of such materials creating adverse effects to health and environment is uncertain. The Applicant should conduct ACM, LBP, and PCB surveys. any of these hazardous materials are determined to be present, the a Applicant should prepare a construction management plan that outlines its intent to comply with SDAPCD Rule 1206 which requires the abatement and control of ACM prior to demolition as well as intent to comply with Title 8, California Code of Regulations which requires the removal and control of LBP prior to demolition. The construction management plan should also describe BMPs to be implemented and requirements for the treatment, handling, and disposal of ACM LBPs, and PCBs. BMPs may include that ACM shall be kept adequately wet during stripping, once removed ACM shall be contained in leak-tight wrapping until properly disposed in an accepting facility,

Particulate Matter (DPM) emissions associated with the sustained operation of heavy construction
equipment.

To date, the Applicant has provided neither air quality modeling (e.g., California Emissions Estimator Model [CalEEMod]) nor a construction management plan that takes into account the nearby sensitive
receptors and describes the required BMPs that would be implemented by the Applicant to avoid or minimize criteria air pollutant emissions and fugitive dust emissions. Therefore, the potential for significant construction-related impacts on air quality is unknown. The Applicant should prepare a construction management plan that outlines the Applicant's intention to comply with San Diego Air Pollution Control District (SDAPCD) Rule 55, which prohibits the discharges of visible dust emissions into the atmosphere beyond the property line for a period or periods amassing more than 3 minutes 3 in any 60-minute period and requires visible roadway dust as a reasult of construction operations be minimized by use of erosion control measures (e.g., track-out grates or gravel beds at egress points, wheel-washing, soil binders, geotextiles, use of secured tarps or cargo covering, watering, treating of
transported material, etc.). SDAPCD Rule 55 also requires street sweeping to be performed at the conclusion of each work day if visible soil material is carried over to adjacent roads (SDAQCD 2009).
Other BMPs to reduce fugitive dust emissions and particulate matter may include daily watering of
exposed soils, application of soil stabalizers, covering of all stock piles with tarp, use of electronic
equipment where feasible, and ensuring construction-related equipment is turned off when not in use.
Preparation of a Human Health Risk Assessment is also suggested, in order to ensure consistency with
the court ruling in Sierra Club v. County of Fresno (Friant Ranch, L.P.) (2018), which determined that a
CEQA-compliant document must provide an adequate discussion of a project's air quality impacts as they connect to adverse human health effects. A Human Health Risk Assessment would assist the City in determining whether there would be any increase in cancer risk at the sensitive receptor locations resulting from construction of the proposed Project.

Construction-Related Noise Impacts: While the
proposed demolition and construction activities
would occur within the time frames prescribed by
Section 10.80.100 of the La Mesa Municipal Code,
the proposed demolition and construction
activities would generate a substantial increase in
noise associated with the operation of heavy construction equipment within 90 feet of the
Church (including Warren Walker School) and 100
feet of a senior living residential apartment
complex. The Applicant has not acknowledged the A senior-living apartment complex is located on Wilson

and consider limiting periods of construction to work around these time periods. The pian should also
describe BMPs and noise mitigation measures to reduce noise impacts experienced by nearby sensitive
receptors. Such BMPs may include ensuring that construction equipment is properly muffled according to manufacturer specifications, using electrically powered tools and facilities to the maximum extent feasible, avoiding of truck idling to the maximum extent feasible, and using noise barriers or noise
blankets.

Identification of Potential Impacts to Sensitive Receptors

Given the proximity of the Project site to the Church, Warren Walker School, and the senior living apartment complex, located to the southeast, construction activities associated with the proposed Project may result in adverse air quality, noise, hazards and hazardous materials, and transportation if not adequately addressed by BMPS enforceable by the City or other regulators. Further, redevelopment of the Project site may result in long- term impacts on hydrology and water quality within the surrounding area.
Regulatory Context
The Applicant's position is that the is proposed Project is categorically exempt from the requirements of CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines §15332:
"Class 32 consists of projects characterized as in-fill development meeting the conditions described in this section. (a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations. (b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses. (c) The project site has no value, as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species. (d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality, (e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services."
However, projects that meet the conditions identified in CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2, Exceptions, do not qualify for Categorical Exemption under CEQA. For example, as described in CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2(c) "Significant Effect. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.'
In these circumstances an Initial Study (IS) must be prepared to determine the extent of potentially significant impacts and assist the Lead Agency in determining whether a Negative Declaration (ND), Mitigated Negative Declaration (MND), or an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) is required.
Potential Significant Effects and Unusual Circumstances

Construction-Related Air Quality Impacts: The
proposed Project, which would include demolition
of the existing LMWC building and grading of
approximately 88 percent of the Project site, would be constructed within 90 feet of the Church, located
immediately adjacent to the Project site, and within 100 feet of the senior living residential apartment complex, located to the southeast. Air quality regulators typically define sensitive receptors as

(e.g., children and elderly persons), resulting in sustained exposure to any pollutants present. Both the Church, Warren Walker School, and nearby senior living apartment complex are consistently occupied by sensitive receptors. As such, given their proximity, these sensitive receptors may experience sustained exposure to criteria air pollutant emissions and fugitive dust emissions generated throughout the duration of proposed demolition and construction activites. Additionally, these sensitive receptors could also experience exposure to Diesel

hardened Portland cement concrete road with a concrete curb and gutter. Stormwater sheet flow is
conveyed to the public storm system via an open brow ditch, which discharges flow to a concrete curb
and gutter, which empties to an existing storm drain downstream of the Project site. (Refer to the
Church's separate analysis summarized above regarding existing and proposed drainage.)
The storm water quality management plan concluded that the proposed Project would alter the existing drainage system through the addition of drainage improvements including a modular basin and wetland
proprietary system to treat stormwater runoff, installation of piped conveyance network, a structural
vault with flow control beneath the parking lot, and rip-rap outfall. Stormwater would be conveyed via
a hardened channel (i.e., curb a or gutter) to a public storm drain at the terminus of Barona Way. The public storm drain conveys water from Barona Way to California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) infrastructure, which ultimately discharges into the San Diego River and the Pacific Ocean,
(Refer to the City's comments and the Church's separate analysis summarized above regarding existing
and proposed drainage.)

Potential pollutants identified by the Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) include sediments,
nutrients, heavy metals, trash and debris, oxygen demanding substances, oil and grease, bacteria and
viruses, and pesticides. BMPs implemented under the proposed Project would include prevention of
illicit discharges, storm drain stenciling or signage, protection of materials stored outdoors (including
trash) from dispersal via wind, rain, run-on or runoff; and source-control BMPs. The storm water
management plan concluded the proposed drainage design is consistent with the requirements of the Storm Water Standards, which are based on the requirements of San Diego Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) Order No. R9-2013-0001 as amended by R9-2015-0001 and R9-2015-0100

Arborist Report Letter (CityMark Communities, LLC, May 6, 2020) - The Applicant prepared an
arborist report letter that specifies trees that would be removed under the proposed Project. The
proposed Project would include the removal of 12 trees, two of which are unhealthy and none of which are protected species. This letter also identifies that tree replacement plans are included in the submitted
landscape plan.

Fire Flow Analysis (Helix Water District, March 20, 2020) - Helix Water District conducted a simulated fire flow analysis and calculated the fire hydrant located at 8850 Grossmont Boulevard has a
fire flow of 5,529 gallons per minute at 20 pound-force per square inch (psi).

Communications, AT&T, and Helix Water District provided letters committing to the provision of utilities
and services to the Project site.

Historical Resource Assessment Report (PaleoWest, LLC, August 19. 2020) - PaleoWest prepared a
Historical Resources Assessment Report for the LMWC building located at 5220 Wilson Street. The
assessment included a review of the cultural resources reports on file at the South Coastal Information
Center (SCIC). The SCCIC search did not identify any historic-period buildings within the vicinity of the Project site. PaleoWest also conducted an in intensive pedestrian survey of the Project are on June 4, 2020. During the survey, the LMWC building was evaluated for historical significance by applying the criteria of the California Register of Historic Resources (CRHR) and the City of La Mesa Historic
Landmarks (Local Register). PaleoWest recommends that LMWC building is not eligible for inclusion in
the CRHR or the Local Register and is, therefore, not a historic resource for the purposes of CEQA.

Traffic Assessment Letter (Angela Merrill, PE, August 20, 2020) - A traffic impact analysis was prepared for the proposed Project on May 18, 2018 by Angela Merrill, PE, to calculate average daily traffic (ADT) volumes and A.M. and P.M. peak-hour traffic that would result following implementation of the proposed Project. The Applicant revised this analysis on August 20, 2020 to address administrative comments provided by the City Department of Public Works. Vehicle trips associated with the existing LMWC and the proposed Project were estimated utilizing San Diego Association of Government
(SANDAG) trip generation rates. The traffic assessment letter determined net trip generation associated
with the proposed Project would be 168 daily trips, including a net increase of five (5) A.M. peak-hour trips, and a net increase of 27 P.M. peak-hour trips, increases that would be below thresholds established by San Diego Traffic Engineers Guidelines in the San Diego Region (January 2019). However, the traffic assessment letter did not calculate or evaluate Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) associated with the
proposed Project, pursuant to the Governor's Office of Planning and Research (OPR) Technical Advisory on Evaluating Transportation Impacts in CEQA or otherwise address the proposed Project's compliance with Senate Bill (SB) 743, which requires the Governor's Office of Planning and Research (OPR) to use Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) per capita, VMT per employee, and net VMT as metrics for identifying and mitigating transportation impacts within CEQA for land use projects. Further, the traffic assessment letter did not evaluate potential geometric hazards such as sharp turns, dangerous intersections, or points of vehicle/pedestrian traffic conflicts associated with the proposed site plan.
Drainage Study (Pasco Laret Suiter & Associates, Inc., August 31, 2020) A drainage study was prepared for the proposed Project on May 1, 2020 by Pasco Laret Suiter & Associates, Inc., to evaluate impacts of the mixed-use development and determine whether the proposed drainage and treatment system. would have the capacity to convey a 100-year, 6-hour storm event. The Applicant revised this analysis on August 31, 2020 to address comments provided by the City. The hydrologic model used to perform the hydrologic analysis utilized the Rational Method (RM) equation to estimate the peak rate of runoff based on the variables of area, runoff coefficient, and rainfall intensity. Further, the study also utilized the runoff coefficient provided by the County of San Diego Hydrology Manual. The study concluded the proposed Project would result in a negligible increase in surface runoff on-site and would not adversely impact downstream facilities. The
study also concluded the storm drain and treatment
systems included in the proposed Project (i.e.,
bioretention basin, biofiltration facility, and
stormwater storage vault) are adequate to intercept, treat, contain, and convey a 100-year, 6-
hour storm event.

Storm Water Quality Management Plan (Pasco
Laret Suiter & Associates, Inc., May 4, 2020) - A
storm water quality management plan was
prepared for the proposed Project on May 4, 2020 by Pasco Laret Suiter & Associates, Inc. to identify
existing drainage patterns at the Project site and the
drainage patterns that would result from

Friday. The demographic profile of these specific populations (i.e., children and seniors) represent the most
sensitive receptors with respect to environmental exposure and risk.

St. Luke's Lutheran Church (including Warren Walker School) is located immediately adjacent to the LMWC building, which is
located at the corner of Wilson Street and Grossmont Boulevard. The two properties are physically separated by a paved
driveway that provides access to the Church's surface parking lot.

These population segments could be affected during demolition and construction activities associated with the proposed Project - both in terms of potential increases in air emissions and increases in noise levels associated
with heavy construction equipment - if best management practices are not implemented by the Applicant and
enforced by the City or other regulators. Further, during Church services as well as school pick-up and drop-off there are large numbers of pedestrians in the vicinity, including elderly persons and children, which could lead to pedestrian-vehicle safety conflicts within the vicinity of. the Project site. Depending on the construction schedule and the proposed construction access, the demolition and construction activities associated with the
proposed Project should address pedestrian-vehicle safety and wayfinding. Further, implementation of the
proposed Project may result in long-term effects including alterations of existing drainage and stormwater runoff. Such changes should be carefully considered and addressed to confirm that the proposed Project would
be consistent with California Drainage Law.

Overview of Applicant-Prepared Materials

As part of the application submittal, the Applicant has prepared a site plan and an Environmental Assessment /
Initial Study Application including supporting attachments. These documents were submitted to the City's
Community Development Department, Planning Division, in May 2020. The City, which is responsible for review of these documents for techincal and legal sufficiency, provided comments to the Applicant on July 31, 2020. The Applicant provided responses to these comments on September 2, 2020.

• Environmental Assessment / Initial Study Application (CityMark Communities, LLC, May 7, 2020)
The Applicant prepared an Environmental Assessment / Initial Study Application to assist the City in
complying with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). This document
has not been revised since its initial submittal on May 7, 2020. This document describes the legal parcels associated with the Project site, describes the characteristics of the proposed Project and construction activities, and provides an environmental impact analysis. The Environmental Assessment / Initial Study
Application states that proposed drainage alternations would not affect downstream drainage facilities
or adjacent properties. This preliminary analysis identifies the prescriptive easement covering the
driveway on the south side of the Project site that is used for access to the Church parking lot and
describes that the proposed Project has been designed to avoid it. The impact analysis provided to the City concludes that there would be no impact associated with air quality or noise; however, the
document does not provide any substantiating evidence or identify any best management practices
(BMPs), enforceable by the City or other regulators, to support this claim.

Subject: Third-Party Comprehensive Review of Project Application Materials for the Proposed Multi- Story Mixed-Use Development at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California
This Third-Party Comprehensive Review of Project Application Materials has been prepared to;
1. Provide a summary of planning documents submitted by Citymark Communities, LLC (Applicant) to the City of La Mesa (City) Community Development Department.
2. •Provide an evaluation of potential impacts to the environment that could result from the proposed Multi-Family Resdiential Development (Project) - including those that could affect nearby sensitive
receptors.

As described in the Environmental / Assessment / Initial Study Application prepared by the Applicant, the
proposed Project would involve demolition of the La Mesa Women's Club (LMWC) building - located on a 0.89- acre site at 5220 Wilson Street - and construction of a new four-story, mixed-use development providing: 49 residential units; commercial space; property manager's office; and tenant amenities, including a fourth-floor roof terrace, ground-level common space, secure bicycle storage, and surface parking and "tuck-under" parking.
The LMWC building, which is proposed for demolition, is located approximatley 90 feet north of St. Luke's Lutheran Church (Church). The properties share a common boundary and are physically seperated by a driveway used to enter/exit the Church's parking lot. Both the Project site and Church are zoned by the City as RB-D-MU (Residential Business / Urban Design Overlay / Mixed Use Overlay). Other existing development in the vicinity of the Project site includes commerical land use to the north and west. A medical office located at 8811 Grossmont Boulevard and an unoccupied building located at 8807 Grossmont Boulevard are located immediatley west of the Project site. Both of these properties are zoned by the City as C-D (General Commercial / Urban Design Overlay). East of the Project site, across from Wilson Street, is a retail tire facility, This property iS zoned by the City as C-D-MU (General Commercial / Urban Design Overlay / Mixed Use Overlay). Other existing development in the vincity includes a senior living apartment complex, located approximately 100 feet
southeast of the Project site.
The Church, which is located at 5150 Wilson Street, hosts services on Sunday mornings and Wednesday evenings and operates a Sunday school for children (including at ages 3 to 10) and adults (including over age 60). The Church also leases property to the Warren Walker School, a private school for children in pre-kindergarten through 5th Grade (PK-5) and provides daycare and schooling services from 8:30 A.M to 4:30 P.M. Monday through Friday. The school also operates after school programs on campus until 6:00 P.M. Monday through

members of the DAB is an integral part of the development review process. The DAB members, or their supervised staff, collaborate and coordinate on the review of development projects regularly to ensure project compliance with codified requirements and to ensure consistency between departments in the review process. Each DAB member is charged with review of projects relative to the requirements within their discipline of work, and with crafting appropriate conditions of approval for projects.
The DAB considers projects for approval in regular, public meetings held on the second and fourth Mondays of each month. The agendas for these meetings are posted not less than 72 hours prior to the meeting time in compliance with the Brown Act. Final determinations on projects can be delayed by several weeks after they are ready to proceed while they wait for a scheduled meeting date to occur.

Staff has been considering and evaluating the DAB and the DAB process to discover if there is a more effective and efficient manner to conduct the business currently undertaken by the DAB.

DISCUSSION:

The DAB process could be achieved in a more streamlined fashion while maintaining the integrity and transparency of the process. Staff suggests the functions that the DAB performs be delegated to the staff members that make up the DAB, but in an administrative process that is coordinated under the Director of Community Development. Currently, each of the DAB members is primarily concerned with the project's compliance with requirements within their discipline. This is in contrast to a typical board or commission, where members consider the whole of a project and whether it complies with all of the applicable requirements related to all disciplines. With an administrative process, each department would continue to review projects in relation to their areas of responsibility and expertise, and develop appropriate conditions of
approval.

The Director of Community Development would gather the project reviews and conditions of approval from each of the reviewing departments in a notice of decision that provides a report on the project and its compliance with applicable requirements, and serves as an approval document that includes conditions of approval. The draft notices of decision would be posted for five calendar days in the same manner and places that DAB agendas are currently posted to
allow the public time to comment on the project. Any comments received would be considered
prior to making the determination proposed in the draft notice of decision. Final approvais of the
Director of Community Development would be subject to appeal to the Planning Commission, and then the City Council, similar to the current DAB appeal process.
The elimination of the DAB meeting would allow projects to proceed to the approval process when ready. Applicants would not have to a wait for a regularly scheduled meeting to occur. The posting of draft notices of decision would continue to provide an opportunity for the public to
comment on projects prior to approval, and comments received would be treated in the same
fashion as they are with the current DAB process. Further, it has been brought to the attention of the City Council and staff (via correspondence dated April 7, 2021) that the regular interaction of DAB staff outside public meetings may not be properly aligned with public meeting laws (Brown Act). The elimination of the DAB would obviate any such concerns.

prompted City staff to begin the appropriate process for elimination (please see the attached
emails between Kerry Kusiak, Director of Planning and Community Development and Greg
Humora, City Manager). Furthermore, at my direction, new development applications in the
future will not be subject to DAB review.
I believe, this action should suffice to remedy any allegations of Brown Act violations that you
have asserted.

Dear Mr. Tinkov:

This correspondence addresses your correspondence referenced above. Perhaps further information will alay your Client's concerns regarding Brown Act Violations by the Development
Advisory Board (DAB). First, a draft ordinance eliminating the DAB is scheduled for
consideration by the La Mesa City Council on May 25, 2021 (agenda available on May 21, 2021)

lawsuit filed regarding the DAB and refuse any request related for Attorneys' fees.

in Furthermore, as I mentioned in my earlier correspondence, at the City Attorney's directive, no
new development applications will be considered by the DAB pending the final outcome related
to the Ordinance.

Thank you for your consideration and I hope this information has been helpful.

Glenn,

Sorry I was unable to pick up the phone when you called today. I have some litigation and mediation deadlines to meet
this week, so likely will not be able to talk today or tomorrow.

I understand that the La Mesa City Council has not made a determination as to whether it will cure and/or correct the • deviations from the Brown Act specified in our April 7, 2021 correspondence - please correct me if some action has been taken, as I have received no notice of such action. My calendar shows that tomorrow, May 7, 2021, represents the last day upon which such a determination may be made, starting the 15-day clock for my client to file a petition for writ of mandate to seek the court's direction. As I will be out of town when this deadline runs, I will be forced to file by April 21, 2021. I further understand from your voicemail, that you believe there may be some solution to this, or perhaps some other issues raised by St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California in its appeal of the Development Advisory
Board's March 8, 2021 approval of the development proposal, and CEQA exemption thereto, at 5220 Wilson Street, La
Mesa, CA 91942.

My client welcomes workable resolutions to its claims, so I would ask that you get back to me by email with sufficient
time to avoid litigation - there is, unfortunately, not much time to do so in light of the short deadlines imposed under
the Brown Act -so that I can quickly pass your suggestions along.

Subject: RE: St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California

Good afternoon Glenn,

I hope this message finds you well.

First, I must note an error in my message of May 6, 2021 below - I had mistakenly indicated that I would be required to file a petition by April 21, 2021 which, of course, would be impossible. I had intended to say that because of previously planned travel, I would have to file by May 21, 2021.

With that out of the way, I have reviewed your letter and while I appreciate what appears to be an earnest desire on the part of Mr. Humora and Mr. Kusiak to eliminate the Development Advisory Board, this response to St. Luke's April 7, 2021 Brown Act Demand for Cure and Correction is legally deficient. The Brown Act requires that the legislative body (i.e., the City Council) review the asserted violations in such a demand and to take action. (See, for instance,
Government Code Section 54960.1(c)(2) ["Within 30 days of receipt of the demand, the legislative body shall cure or
correct the challenged action and inform the demanding party in writing of its actions to cure or correct or inform the demanding party in writing of its decision not to cure or correct the challenged action."].)

Though Mr. Humora is the City Manager, and Mr. Kusiak is the Director of Planning and Community Development, I am
not aware of any statutory or caselaw which would indicate they have the authority to respond to a demand of this
nature in compliance with the Act. Of course, if you have some legal basis to believe otherwise, | look forward to
reviewing the material. Failing this, and in light of what I understand to be inaction on the part of the City Council with respect to my client's allegations of improprieties under the Brown Act, St. Luke's is forced to proceed as indicated previously (and corrected above).

Sincerely,
Felix Tinkov

Kerry,

Thank you for your emall,
After discussions with the City Attorney, we both agree that your suggestions regarding the DAB should be implemented. Therefore, In conjunction with the City Attorney's office (after consultatlon with the Mayor), I will be
placing this matter on the Councll agenda for its consideration as soon as possible, but no later than 30 days from today. Furthermore, at the direction of the City Attorney, as of today, no further new applications will be processed through the DAB. This action remedies any allegations of Brown Act violations regarding the DAB.

Subject: Development Advisory Board

Greg,
As we have discussed, the appellant's attorney in the Wilson Street project (2020-16) has also challenged the validity of
the makeup of the Development Advisory Board (DAB) under the Brown Act. The challenge centers on the contention that the staff that make up the DAB (Director of Community Development, Director of Public Works, Building Official, and Fire Marshall) have serial meetings in violation of the Act. The attorney notes that the staff on the board necessarily interact outside of public meetings to perform the function of project review.
In this regard, I think the attorney may be on point. To remedy this situation, I suggest that the DAB be eliminated as soon as possible and replaced with an administrative review process under the authorlty of the Community
Development Director. The process could include some level of public review period of projects prior to a decision being made, with the possibility of appeal. Since the DAB was established by ordinance, an ordinance would be needed to
amend the Zoning Code to remove the DAB and Insert the administrative process. If you are ln agreement with this approach, we could have a staff report ready to introduce the concept to the City Council and receive authorization to
proceed as carly as the Council meeting scheduled for May 25, 2021.

Further, I would suggest that no new applications received going forward should be heard by the DAB. With that in
mind, we would proceed immedlately with an amendment once authorized to establish a new process as quickly as
possible so as not to delay the project review process.

Re: April 7, 2021 Correspondence-Brown Act Demand for Cure and Correction Regarding
Development Advisory Board

Dear Mr. Tinkov:

This correspondence addresses your correspondence as referenced above. Please note that numerous discussions have transpired among City staff over the years regarding the elimination of the Development Advisory Board (DAB) for various reasons. Your
correspondence has prompted City staff to begin the appropriate process for elimination (please see the attached emails between Kerry Kusiak, Director of Planning and Community Development and Greg Humora, City Manager). Furthermore, at my direction, now development applications in the future will not be subject to DAB review.
believe this action should suffice to remedy any allegations of Brown Act violations that you
have asserted.

Also, because of the issues raised in your correspondence, If so requested by your Client, City staff would be happy to "redo" the March 8, 2021 DAB hearing on the development project planned at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California.
Please contact me with any questions, concerns or requests. Thank you and have a pleasant
vacation.

Glenn,

Sorry I was unable to pick up the phone when you called today. I have some litigation and mediation deadlines to meet
this week, so likely will not be able to talk today or tomorrow.

I understand that the La Mesa City Council has not made a determination as to whether it will cure and/or correct the
deviations from the Brown Act specified in our April 7, 2021 correspondence - please correct me if some action has been taken, as I have received no notice of such action. My calendar shows that tomorrow, May 7, 2021, represents the last day upon which such a determination may be made, starting the 15-day clock for my client to file a petition for writ of mandate to seek the court's direction. As I will be out of town when this deadline runs, I will be forced to file by April 21, 2021. l further understand from your voicemail, that you believe there may be some solution to this, or perhaps
some other issues raised by St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California in its appeal of the Development Advisory
Board's March 8, 2021 approval of the development proposal, and CEQA exemption thereto, at 5220 Wilson Street, La
Mesa, CA 91942.

My client welcomes workable resolutions to its claims, so I would ask that you get back to me by email with sufficient
time to avoid litigation - there is, unfortunately, not much time to do so in light of the short deadlines imposed under
the Brown Act - so that I can quickly pass your suggestions along.

development plan approval by the DAB]; LMMC $ 2.66.110 [requiring the DAB to meet with respect to certain development projects pursuant to Ordinance 2457, July 14, 1987]; and LMMC § 24.02.037 (Ord. 97-2686 § 2 formulated November 25, 1997); LMMC § 22.04.010 (Ord. 2315 formulated May 26, 1983); LMMC § 18.18.060 (Ord. 2358 formulated June 21, 1984); LMMC § 22.03.010 (Ord. 2006-2774 § 1 formulated November 28, 2006); and LMMC § 22.02.010 (Ord. 2307; March 24, 1983.) In short, there is little question that the DAB is subject to the Brown Act.
A meeting is defined by the Brown Act as "any congregation by a majority" of the legislative body at the same time and place to "hear, discuss, or deliberate" on any matter within the jurisdiction of the body. The Brown Act, Open Meetings For Local Legislative Bodies, Office of the Attorney General, 2003, at p. 8. Because all of the DAB board members congregated
together, albeit by remote video conference, to hear, discuss and deliberate on the Project's site development plan and CEQA exemption, the requirement a for a public meeting under the Brown Act is met. In light of these facts, the DAB's March 8, 2021 hearing on the Project was, and is, a public hearing subject to all of the requirements of the Brown Act, contrary to Mr. Kusiak's
assertions.

We strongly recommend the City Council direct the City Attorney, or other legal counsel, properly train the DAB board members, and the City staff more generally, on the requirements of the Brown Act to avoid such confusion and any further violations in the future.

CONCLUSION

Given the above points, SLLC demands the City Council:

(1) Acknowledge the violations described above and make a commitment not to act in a
similar manner in the future;
(2) Afford the public a reasonable opportunity to communicate with the DAB prior to, and during, all future public hearings of the board;
(3) Revise the constituents of the DAB board to comport with the Brown Act;
(4) Revise the LMMC with respect to the DAB board to comport with the Brown Act; and (5) Rescind any and all actions taken during the March 8, 2021 DAB hearing on the Project pending further rehearing by the reconstituted DAB.
The City Council must notify this office of its decision to cure and correct as demanded no later 5 than 5 p.m. on Friday, May 7, 2021.
Should the City Council fail, or refuse to perform as demanded, this will serve as evidence of an actual and present disagreement over the public's rights and the City's responsibilities under the Brown Act and may lead my client to consider legal action as authorized by the Brown Act. It

PWM471

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Honorable Mayor Arapostathis and City Council
April 7, 2021
Page 3 of 5

In light of the egregious nature of the City's handling of the public comment portion of the hearing, which can only be considered arbitrary, capricious, restrictive, and unreasonable in light of the opportunities afforded to the Project applicant, we strongly recommend the City Council correct this violation of the Brown Act by ordering a new DAB hearing affording the public right to be heard.

3. The Brown Act prohibits serial meetings - that is, a majority of the decision making members may not "use a series of communications of any kind, directly or through intermediaries, to discuss, deliberate, or take action on any item of business outside of the public meeting. Government Code § 54952.2(b). Yet, this is precisely what happened (and likely happens with respect to all DAB matters) in that each of the board members of that body are City staff members (Community Development Director Kerry Kusiak, City Engineer Leon Firsht, Building Division Director Aaron Sturm, and Fire Marshal Steve Swaney), all of whom by necessity of their respective positions specifically interacted with one another, either serially or in groups, to determine what impacts, requirements, conditions, and features the Project has, or should have.
Such discussions of the Project, and the DAB's ultimate outcome, run afoul of the Brown Act and cannot conceivably be corrected without the replacement of each of the board members with individuals other than City staff members. We suggest the City Council disband the DAB and appoint new board members whose positions do not require that they review, discuss, and otherwise weigh in on development projects which go before the DAB to avoid such conflicts going forward. We further suggest that in light of these circumstances, the DAB's approval of the Project, and its prospective CEQA exemption, be rescinded until such time as a new DAB board
is empaneled.

Further, we note what appears to be a misconception on the part of the DAB chair, Mr. Kusiak. Throughout the DAB meeting, Mr. Kusiak claimed that this was "not a public hearing" but was instead a "posted board meeting" which "did not require public noticing." This is incorrect.
Government Code section 54952(b) provides that the provisions of the Brown Act cover "legislative bodies" which include each:
..commission, committee, board, or other body of a local agency, whether permanent or temporary, decision making or advisory, created by charter, ordinance, resolution, or formal action of a legislative body....

The DAB is such a "legislative body" for the purposes of the Brown Act in that it is a permanent board, created by the City through by ordinance and/or formal action. See, for instance, La Mesa Municipal Code ("LMMC') § 24.02.010 [specifying the responsibility of the DAB to review development proposals and specifically indicating it is subordinate to the City Council pursuant to Ord. 2600 §§ 2-6 formulated April 28, 1992); LMMC 009 24.02.035 [requiring site

legislative body's consideration of the item, that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the legislative body....
(Emphasis added.)

On December 17, 2020, this firm specifically requested to be notified of all Project and CEQA-related hearings. The City, through its City Clerk, acknowledged receipt of the request on December 28, 2020. (Exhibit "A".) Notwithstanding this, we never received notice of the March 8. 2021 DAB hearing from the City. Rather, our client fortuitously notified us of the DAB hearing on March 5, 2021 at approximately 11:15 am. Making matters worse, the DAB. staff report indicated that any audio/visual presentation to be made by the public would need to be submitted by 12:00 pm on that same day - March 5, 2021. (Exhibit "B".)
As it is impossible to put together such a presentation, and to submit it to it the City, in the span of 45 minutes, SLLC was not able to present its position, in full, during the course of the DAB's consideration of the Project. This is violative of Government Code section 54954.3(a) in that the City failed to afford this firm, and the public generally, an opportunity to directly address
the DAB as required.
We strongly suggest the City Council correct this by ordering the DAB hold a new hearing on the Project and that the public be afforded proper notice of this new hearing.

2. The Brown Act does not permit the City to limit public participation in a manner that is "too arbitrary and capricious, too restrictive and unreasonable." Nevens v. Chino (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 775, 778; see also Robins v. Pruneyard Shopping Center (1979) 23 Cal.3d 899, 907 [The right of the people to petition the government for redress of grievances is "vital to a basic process in the state's constitutional scheme."]; Cal. Const., I, Art. I, § 3(a), (b)(1), and (b)(7).
Yet, this is precisely what the City did in foisting : 150-page DAB staff report, without notice, on the public. It followed this violative action by then restricting the public's ability to participate in the March 8, 2021 hearing the staff report indicated that public comments had to be delivered solely via email by 8:00 am on March 8, 2021, so that only the first 300 words of any such comment would be placed into the record before the DAB. Of the public comments that were read, the majority indicated they had insufficient time to review the staff report, and/or that they were elderly and without access to email (requiring the assistance of family members', with limited time and resources of their own, to register their position with respect to the Project). This, notwithstanding the fact, that each of the DAB board members, the City staff, and Project applicant
spoke freely, and without limitation in fact, the DAB chair continued the Project's hearing repeatedly to permit one of the applicant's consultants an opportunity to appear resulting in the closure of the hearing almost two hours after it started. Yet, not a single member of the public was permitted to speak, or to present anything more than 300 words.

Subject: Brown Act Demand for Cure and Correction Regarding Development Advisory Board

Honorable Mayor Arapostathis and City Council:
This demand is made on behalf of this firm's client, St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California ("SLLC"*). All further communications regarding this matter should be directed to this office.

On March 8, 2021 at 10 am (PST), the City of La Mesa ("City") Development Advisory Board ("DAB") held a public hearing with respect to the prospective development of the La Mesa Woman's Club property at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California 91942 (the "Project"), and its claimed exemption from the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Leading up to, and during the course of, that DAB hearing the City ran afoul of the Ralph M. Brown Act (Government Code sections 54950 et seq.; the "Brown Act") which requires the public be afforded various rights to be heard, and to hear, about matters of public concern such as the Project. These rights were violated, and this situation must be rectified by the City Council.
We present this correspondence in the hopes that the City Council will take this opportunity to cure or otherwise correct these Brown Act violations so that no further action need be taken by the SLLC to resolve these issues.

Violations of the Brown Act

1. The Brown Act, at Government Code section 54954.3(a), requires public agencies provide:

...an opportunity for members of the public to directly address the legislative body on any item of interest to the public, before or during the

Hollywoodland Specific Plan v City of Los Angeles (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1187; McQueen v Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1148; Lewis v Seventeenth District Agricultural Association (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 823, 211.)

In light of these facts, the City cannot use a categorical exemption to avoid further analysis of the Project and must proceed to prepare an initial study followed by the preparation of a mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report permitting the public and the City's decisionmakers a thoughtful and reasoned opportunity to examine the totality of the Project and its potential impacts.

III. Conclusion

The City has failed to provide the public with a substantive opportunity to participate in a public forum regarding this Project in light of the inadequate (and with respect to the DAB, non- existent) notice, along with the practical impossibility of petitioning the government with a fulsome expression of the public's interests and grievances with regard to the development. The sharply limited deadlines needlessly imposed on the public do not comport with the law.
Further, the Project does not comply with the City's General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, the State Density Bonus Law, nor CEQA. In all, this Project must be sent back for significant further revisions and review.

We further note that the church is now engaged in a quiet title action with the LMWC,1 before the superior court, over the church's driveway to resolve the ownership, possession, and control of this area. Should the court determine that the church is the title owner of the land, the
Project's total size will be sharply reduced resulting in a significant reduction in its base density, as well as any density bonus which may be afforded to it under the current proposal. Moreover, the Project seeks to install a tall retaining wall along this driveway, which will not be permissible upon the church securing explicit title in this land. And, the Project plans show that the church's driveway is being improperly shown as a fire truck access road during times of emergency though it does not offer access to the Project site given the steep slope separating the properties. In light of this, we strongly recommend the City hold back any decision which may result in confusing these issues or bringing the City into the action unnecessarily.

We note the DRB and DAB Staff Reports both inaccurately claim that the Project site at 5220 Wilson Street is owned by CityMark. It is, in fact, owned solely by the LMWC according to the church's latest information.

throughout the site's development both before (during demolition) and long past (during construction) the grading operations. The noise from all of this construction will flow unimpeded into the directly adjacent school and playground disrupting hundreds of children's' education for what is likely to be a period of one to two years.
(3) Hazardous materials disposal during construction. The LMWC building was
constructed prior to the elimination of asbestos-containing materials, lead-based paints,
and polychlorinated biphenyls, yet no analysis has been made of these hazards (or methods to mitigate these potential hazards) upon adjacent residents, churchgoers, senior living facility residents, and/or schoolchildren. (4) Hydrology and water quality impacts from the developed Project. The church's experts have analyzed the existing site, and the proposed Project at build-out, and determined that the Project's drainage study inaccurately describes the conditions such that considerably more stormwater is expected to flow onto the church property than
reported. (5) Transportation impacts from construction and the developed Project. These impacts include significant numbers of heavy-haul trucks going through Wilson Street (designated a local collector) interrupting regular traffic and parking along the road, as well as church and school pick-ups and drop-offs, and a failure to follow the current standard in traffic analysis under CEQA, namely a vehicle miles traveled (VMT) analysis pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15064.3. And as indicated above, the analysis indicates the dangers inherent in the intersection at Grossmont Boulevard and
Wilson Street.

But for the Project's hydrology and water quality analyses, the church's expert analyses on the remaining impact categories described above remain the only information in the administrative record such that the City cannot simply overlook the described potentially significant impacts. Neither the Project applicant, nor the City itself, have made any attempt to respond to these expert analyses such that CEQA requires that an initial study be prepared. (Hansen Brothers Enterprises, Inc. V. Board of Supervisors (1996) 12 Cal.4th 533, 560 [standing for the proposition that undisputed evidence in the administrative record must be relied upon.].) Until such time as the Project applicant, or the City, rebut the evidence presented by the church's experts, and with respect to certain issues, the testimony, and opinions of laypersons, those remain the only materials upon which the City may rely in determining whether the exemption to CEQA under Guidelines section 15332 may be effective.
Under CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c), "[a] categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have : significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." Such an exception to CEQA Guidelines section 15332 exists in the administrative record in light of church's undisputed expert testimony as to impact categories described above. The City may not ignore evidence of an unusual circumstance creating a reasonable possibility of a significant environmental impact. (Committee to Save the

A. The City May Not Apply The In-Fill Development Exemption In Light Of The Project's Expected, and Known, Potentially Significant Impacts

The City proposes to avoid CEQA review of the Project by employing the In-Fill Development exemption found at CEQA Guidelines section 15332. This exemption provides that in-fill development may avoid CEQA analysis if:
(a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations. (b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses. (c) The project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened
species. (d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality. (e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.

Our client has secured all Project materials the City purports to have in its possession or control via the California Public Records Act ("CPRA"). In securing this data, it has become readily obvious that very little analysis of the Project's potentially significant impacts to the environment have been performed to date. In fact, the only data in the administrative record analyzing the Project under CEQA has been provided by our client's environmental experts. These analyses, and the records produced pursuant to the above-mentioned CPRA request, indicate that though CityMark submitted an "Environmental Assessment/Initial Study Application" the City has performed no analysis of its own and has no Initial Study to indicate whether further environmental review must occur. Moreover, the expert analyses provided by our client, concretely and definitively specifies potentially significant impacts in the following CEQA categories:

(1) Air quality impacts arising from construction. This is especially important in that the
Project proposes significant grading - "400 cubic yards of excavation (cut) and 1,400 cubic yards of fill... primarily used to raise the rear of the site to establish a pad for the parking area [along with].... [a] retaining wall of up to eight and a half feet in height is planned along the south end of the parking area" - which is directly adjacent to the area where 125 students currently attend the Warren Walker School, on the church campus. These students are sensitive receptors, spending time outdoors to learn and play, and with open windows, especially during the COVID-19 era, to provide additional ventilation limiting disease spread. (2) Noise impact arising from construction. Again, much like the air impacts category, directly above, but likely to last significantly longer as the construction noise will exist

While the Guidelines provide opportunities for projects to be exempted from CEQA review, these exemptions are limited in nature. "Only those projects having no significant effect on the environment are categorically exempt from CEQA review." (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network, supra, at p. 1102.) A significant effect is a "substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in the environment." (Pub. Res. Code $21068. [Emphasis added.]) This means that an activity has a significant effect if, among other things, it "has the potential to degrade the quality of the environment." (Pub. Res. Code 21083.) "[A]n activity that may have a significant effect on the environment cannot be categorically exempt." (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 124. [Emphasis added.1)
The courts review categorical exemptions using strict construction in a manner affording the greatest environmental protection within the reasonable scope of the statutory language. (County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 966.) "[B]xemption categories are not to be expanded or broadened beyond the reasonable scope of their statutory language." (Dehne v. County of Santa Clara (1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 827, 842.) Thus, an exemption must be applicable in light of the full scope of a project.
A public agency has the burden of proving that substantial evidence supports its factual finding that a project falls within the asserted exemption. (Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose, 54 Cal. App. 4th 106, 114-115 (1997); Magan v. County of Kings (2002) 105 Cal.App.4th 468, 475.) "An agency's duty to provide such factual support 'is all the more important where the record shows ...that opponents of the project have raised arguments regarding possible significant environmental impacts." (Muzzy Ranch Co. v. Solano County Airport Land Use Com. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 372, 386.) A city cannot impose a burden on the public to prove a possibility of adverse environmental impacts since this would frustrate CEQA's fundamental purpose of ensuring that government officials "make decisions with environmental consequences in mind." (Davidon Homes, supra, at p. 116; California Farm Bureau Federation v. California Wildlife Conservation Bd. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 186.) "[T]he agency's exemption determination must be supported by evidence in the record demonstrating that the agency considered possible environmental impacts in reaching its decision." (Da vidon Homes, supra, at p. 117; East Peninsula Ed. Council, Inc. v. Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School Dist. (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 155, 171.)
The record before the City, limited as it is because of the lack of analysis performed by CityMark, reveals that the Project's potential effects on the environment make the application of a categorical exemption legally inappropriate. In fact, most of the environmental analysis performed, to date, has been by the church's experts and those analysis have not been challenged, nor apparently analyzed by the City.

which has been in place for over half a century and, thus, conflicts directly and inarguably with this policy.
6) Objective UD-3.1 requires that development be "architecturally and environmentally sensitive and ...compatible with neighboring design and scale." As indicated in
the discussions regarding Policy LU-1.2.2 and Policy LU-2.1.2 directly above, the Project is unlike anything in this neighborhood, especially with respect to its design and scale, and therefore, conflicts with this objective of the General Plan.
In short, the Project cannot be said to be in harmony with the City's General Plan Land Use and Urban Design Element as proposed. As such, it must be revised significantly to come into conformance with the General Plan, and the surrounding community.

II. The Project Fails To Comply With The California Environmental Quality Act
The primary purposes of CEQA are to inform City decisionmakers, as well as the public, about the potential impacts of a project, and to prescribe mitigation measures to avoid such impacts. CEQA requires a broad view of what constitutes project requiring environmental analysis. (McQueen v. Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1143.) Even projects that appear benign will likely fall within the ambit of CEQA. (Bloom v. McGurk (1994) 26 Cal.App.4lh 1307, 1312.) The California State Legislature formulated CEQA to "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of the environment shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions." (Pub. Res. Code §21001(d).) To implement this goal, CEQA requires municipalities to analyze discretionary projects for potential environmental impacts utilizing a three-tier system. (No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 74.) The first tier is known as a preliminary review. The preliminary review requires public agency staff to analyze a complete application in order to discern the full scope of the project at issue. (CEQA Guidelines section 15060(b); City of Pasadena V. The State of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 810, 836.) Once the parameters of the project are established, a determination is made to resolve whether an exemption is applicable to the project. If such an exemption is found, the agency must determine that no exceptions to the exemption are triggered by the potential impacts from the full scope of the project. (CEQA Guidelines §8 15060, 15061.) If the project is not exempt from CEQA, or an exception is applicable, the second tier of review is required wherein an initial study is prepared because it has been a determined that there is a possibility that the project may have a significant effect on the environment. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063.) An initial study facilitates environmental assessment
early in the design of a project. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063(c).) In the third tier, the initial study is used to demonstrate that either: a) the project "will not have a significant effect," triggering the preparation of a negative declaration, or b) the project is one "which may have significant effect on the environment," triggering the preparation of an environmental impact report ("EIR"). (CEQA Guidelines § 15064.)

elements." (Resource Defense Fund V. County of Santa Cruz (1982) 133 Cal.App.3rd 800, 806.) CEQA imposes an obligation on La Mesa to assess the Project's consistency with the City's General Plan. (North Coast Rivers Alliance et al. v. Marin Municipal Water District (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 614, 633.) The Project, as designed and proposed, cannot be found to be consistent with the Land Use and Urban Design Element of the City's General Plan.
By way of example:

1) Policy LU-1.2.2 requires that "[a]s part of the development review process, City departments will review all future development to ensure that safety requirements are met, including building and fire codes, accessibility standards and crime prevention techniques. Yet, as indicated above, the City's failure to ensure that the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street indicates that no such review has been performed (or that, if it has, the requirement to ensure safety has been obviated) such that a dangerous condition not only is permitted to exist, but it is being worsened by increasing the vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the area while also attempting to authorize a large development where e single-story structure currently exists, further reducing sight lines on a dangerous curve in the road. Similarly, the proposed waivers to reduce parking space dimensions and drive aisle widths do not "ensure that safety requirements are met, including building and fire codes, [nor] accessibility standards."
2) Policy LU-2.1.2 requires the City to "[s]upport infill development and subdivision proposals that reinforce neighborhood strengths and benefit neighborhood identity,' yet the Project proposes a development which is so different in character and intensity from any other in the neighborhood, both with respect to its architectural style and the materials used on its exterior walls - none of which can be found elsewhere in this community. Thus, it cannot be said that this Project will "reinforce" the existing visual appeal of the community.
3) Policy LU-2.1.5 requires the implementation of projects in the "Mixed-Use Overlay Zone by promoting the rehabilitation of properties and new development that fits into the context of the existing neighborhoods while meeting the City's Urban Design Objectives for infill development." Again, as noted directly above, in #2, the Project is completely out of character and context with respect to the existing neighborhood such that this policy cannot be met.
4) Policy LU-4.2.3 requires that "[n]ew development shall provide adequate parking." As the Project specifically seeks to not only reduce parking space numbers below the City's normal standards, it also seeks to reduce the number below those permitted under the State Density Bonus Law (albeit, improperly attempting to do so via a waiver, as indicated in the immediately preceding two sections of this letter). Also, as indicated in the immediately preceding section, the Project does not provide adequate parking not only with respect to the reduced number it of spaces it proposes, but also improperly attempts to reduce the dimensions of the spaces and the drive aisles around them in a manner likely to impact the public's (and future residents') health and safety. Thus, the Project clearly conflicts with this policy as well.
5) Objective UD-1.1 requires the City's "ItJo protect La Mesa's existing built environment and cultural heritage." But the Project proposes to destroy the LMWC clubhouse

B. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Not Permitted To Overcome Regulations That Pertain To Health And Safety

As mentioned above, the Project's requests for waivers are inapposite to the law
because they pertain to financial rather than physical constraints. In addition, the Project improperly seeks to waive the City's standard parking space and driving aisle dimensions even though this would result in direct health and safety impacts. Waivers are impermissible on this basis as well.

The dimensions of parking spaces and adjacent driving aisles are specified to ensure the safety of vehicles, their drivers and passengers, and pedestrians. (LMMC § 22.112.010(B).) This makes common sense - if spaces and driving aisles are too small, or otherwise constrained, they are likelier to lead to physical harm from other vehicles when vacating or entering a space and are the reason why State building codes requires minimum parking dimensions to ensure health and safety. (DAB Stäff Report, p. 3 & Attachment D, PP. 3-4; DRB Staff Report, p. 3 & Attachment E, PP. 3-4.)
Government Code section 65915(e)(1) of the State Density Bonus Law provides:
Nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted to require a local government to waive or reduce development standards if the waiver or reduction would have a specific, adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5, upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact. [Emphasis added.]

Thus, a waiver cannot be used to avoid the specific, adverse impact arising from
the reduction of a basic safety feature inherent in parking stall/space sizes and driving aisle dimensions as contemplated by the Project due to the health and safety issues it raises. No justification exists which would be sufficient to overcome this requested reduction in health and safety standards, nor would an incentive permit such a thing.
C. The Project, As Designed, Is Contrary To The Chief Land Use Policies Declared Under
The Land Use And Urban Design Element Of The General Plan
California law requires each city and county to adopt a general plan, a comprehensive long-
term plan for the development of that city or county, famously referred to by the state Supreme
Court as the "constitution for future development." (Lesher Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 540.) A general plan must contain seven mandatory "elements," including a "land use element" to designate the level of intensity and general distribution of land uses. (Gov. Code § 65302.) "[TJhe propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development depends upon [a finding of] consistency with the applicable general plan and its

PWM456

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard

Pursuant to Government Code §65915(e)(1), waivers (as opposed to incentives) are afforded to a density bonus project only when a "development standard will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development," not because the developer desires it, or because it will enhance the financial prospects of a project. Put another way, a waiver permits deviation from, or altogether evasion of, regulations which affect a project due to its site-specific physical features. This subject site has no such physical constraints. Rather, the balconies could be built outside of the pedestrian realm (i.e., within the building envelope) by moving the exterior walls along Grossmont Boulevard back four feet, or removed altogether. The applicant itself makes clear that it is a not a physical constraint that drives this waiver request when it states its justification as follows:
This waiver is requested due to excessive space and cost impacts to incorporate the Open Space requirement and private balconies. The loss of development potential to incorporate this would make the project infeasible to provide the affordable units.
As mentioned above, the site itself does not have any physical obstruction which precludes construction of these balconies, rather CityMark simply desires to have them overhang the pedestrian realm because it would increase their financial incentive to develop the Project. The State Density Bonus Law permits this sort of deviation from regulation for financial gain through the use of incentives, of which the Project has two (waivers, on the other hand, are unlimited for such developments). Yet, the Project avoids using any of its incentives and instead improperly requests at least five waivers to avoid its open space requirements, building height limit, parking space sizing, landscaping required within the pedestrian realm, and overall parking requirements. In each such instance, CityMark indicates that the justification for the waiver is not a physical constraint unique to the site but rather the request is made to seek a financial boon for the
developer.
The reason the Project seeks to use waivers rather than incentives is clear on its face - the State Density Bonus Law does not authorize a sufficient number of incentives (i.e., the Project requires five, but only has two available to it) to meet CityMark's desired financial goals, whereas it may request an unlimited number of waivers. Because it does not have sufficient incentives to develop the Project in this manner, it attempts to avoid their use altogether and instead make faulty justifications for waivers which are impermissible under the law.
Because CityMark cannot show a physical constraint exists which limits the development of the Project under the City's laws and policies, it must use its incentives (and justify the use of those incentives by showing the financial benefit gained thereby) and/or redesign the Project to be in conformity with the law.

§ 24.18.040(B).) The condition to pay a fee in lieu of an actual mitigation measure regarding a known project impact runs afoul of CEQA and should not be permitted. Rather the Project must be required to perform an analysis to determine the scope of the impact and to then propose a mitigation measure to reduce that impact to a less than significant level.
Moreover, this mitigation measure is improper on two other bases. First, it improperly attempts to defer mitigation until a later (and, in this case, unknown future) time. This is specifically forbidden under CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4 (a)(1)(B).) And second, a mitigation measure is only available if a project under CEQA is expected to generate a potentially significant impact on the environment, but the staff report indicates that the Project is exempt from CEQA because there are no such expected impacts. (DAB Staff Report, p. 7-8; see also DAB Staff Report, Attachment A, "Resolution No. DAB-2021-xx" at Par. 1.) So, either the Project is not exempt from CEQA and cannot be conditioned to mitigate a potentially significant impact, or it must be analyzed properly under CEQA (i.e., by preparation of an Initial Study, followed by specific impact category studies, and the development of a mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report). The status quo does not comport with the law. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network V. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102 [a public agency may not adopt mitigation measures for a project for the purpose of qualifying it for a categorical CEQA exemption; see also Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1200.)
A. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Limited To Overcoming Physical, Not Financial, Constraints Such That Avoiding Improvements To The Pedestrian Realm Are Not Permitted For This Project
As indicated above, the Project is designated Mixed Use Urban requiring improvements to the surrounding pedestrian realm. LMMC § 24.18.020(E) defines the term "pedestrian realm" as follows:

"Pedestrian realm" means twelve-foot wide area located between the face of the
curb of a Circulation Element designated street and the face of the building. The pedestrian realm includes the parkway, sidewalk, and landscaped areas. The pedestrian realm may include both public and private property where the public right-of-way is not twelve feet wide. Pedestrian amenities, street trees, street furniture, bus stop facilities, and other landscaping, as specified in this chapter, shall be included in the public realm.
Notwithstanding this acknowledged requirement, "[w]aivers are being requested to allow reductions in... pedestrian realm requirements."(DAB Staff Report, p. 3; DRB Staff Report, p. 3.) For instance, the Project seeks a "waiver" under the State Density Bonus Law so that it may encroach four feet into the pedestrian realm along Grossmont Boulevard by installing balconies hanging over this right of way. This miscomprehends what a waiver is under the law.

The Project sits under 100 feet away, directly across Grossmont Boulevard, from the Grossmont Shopping Center. The closest supermarket to the Project is the Walmart Neighborhood Market therein, lying approximately 350 feet away, yet because there is no crosswalk, stop sign, and/or traffic signal at the intersection of Wilson Street and Grossmont Boulevard, a resident of the Project would be required to walk about three-quarters of a mile to safely cross the street, pick up groceries, and return with them - it is doubtful many residents will be able to lug an average family's weekly groceries this distance, on foot. (DAB Staff Report, p. 2 [In fact, the City recognizes this failing at the beginning of its report, "The intersection is not signalized and is lacking curb ramps and crosswalks."]; see also DRB Staff Report at p. 2 for the same acknowledgment of a dangerous condition].) Notwithstanding this, it appears the Project is being permitted to avoid the development of a crosswalk which is absolutely necessary for its residents or, at least, providing an analysis showing the Project will generate significantly more average daily vehicular trips and vehicle miles traveled than contemplated.
The City failed to require a traffic analysis for the Project, though it initially sought to require an ADA-compliant ramp be constructed at this intersection before apparently dropping this condition altogether. Our client's environmental consultant has also indicated this intersection is particularly dangerous because of limited sightlines arising from a substantial curve in Grossmont Boulevard in this area. The observation that this particular intersection is dangerous has been voiced numerous times in correspondence submitted to the City by multiple parties. Yet the staff reports show that no ramp, crosswalk, or analysis was required of the Project - instead, the Project is conditioned to provide a $5,000 "fair-share" payment toward a ramp to be built by an unknown party at an unknown time in the future. This does not comport with the law.
There appears to be no plan on file to develop a safe intersection at Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street, and the $5,000 payment does not appear to go towards any previously approved fund for that purpose. Nor is there any indication of how this figure was calculated. In Anderson First Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173, the appellate court held that paying a "fair-share fee" is permissible as effective mitigation only if the fees are "part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency commits itself to implementing." That is not the case in this instance. In light of this, the City must require the installation of an
appropriately signalized intersection, or some other traffic calming feature here, or require the Project to present an analysis indicating why it should not do so. The only evidence in the administrative record, to date, on this topic shows that the City initially desired a crosswalk to be installed but backed off without explanation (or analysis available to the public, or the City's
decisionmakers).
"In MU areas, new development is required to include pedestrian realm improvements along collector streets to encourage pedestrian activity. The Circulation Element classifies Grossmont Boulevard as a major collector street subject to pedestrian realm requirements." (DAB Staff Report, p. 2; DRB Staff Report, p. 2. [Emphasis added.]; see also La Mesa Municipal Code

in light of California Executive Order N-29-20. Yet, the failure to afford the public practical
opportunity to review, analyze, and respond to the Project's 137-page DRB staff report and the 150-page DAB staff report does not comport with the public's statutory and constitutional rights to petition its government under the Ralph M. Brown Act. (Government Code 54950 et seq.; Cal. Const., Art. I§ 3, subd. (a) and (b)(1), (7).) These actions run afoul of the law as they present limitations on public participation which are simply "too arbitrary and capricious, too restrictive and unreasonable." (Nevens v. Chino (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 775, 778; see also Robins v. Pruneyard Shopping Center (1979) 23 Cal.3d 899, 907 [The right of the people to petition the government for redress of grievances is "vital to a basic process in the state's constitutional scheme."].)

Furthermore, should CityMark, or its consultants, be permitted to present audio/visual materials to, or communicate directly with, the DAB or DRB boards during these hearings on March 8, 2021 it will only heighten the inequities inherent in providing late, or no, notice to the public, with regard to the respective rights of the parties to petition their government. This would be an unfortunate, and likely unlawful, action in unequal treatment under both state and federal statutes and constitutions. A more reasoned action would be to postpone each of the DAB and DRB hearings by week, or more, to permit each party, and the public more generally, an opportunity to present their positions thoughtfully.
Notwithstanding this, we offer a limited summary of our client's position with respect to the proposed Project in the hopes that it will it be presented to the DAB and DRB board members for review prior to any discussion of, or determination on, this matter. In light of the severely constrained time available to us before the DAB and DRB meetings, we will not reiterate each of the points made in prior communications and correspondence delivered to the City in opposition to the Project but join in those comments by this reference. Rather, we will focus briefly on the
inadequate analysis of the Project in light of the City's General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, the Project's inapt use of California State Density Bonus Law (Gov. Code § 65915 et seq.) waivers, and the impropriety of the claimed CEQA exemption under Guidelines section 15332.

I. The Project Runs Afoul Of The General Plan's Urban Design Element And The Zoning Ordinance
As the staff reports to each of the DAB and DRB indicate, the Project site is designated as "Mixed Use Urban," corresponding to the Mixed Use (MU) Overlay, in the Residential Business base zone and is intended to support "pedestrian friendly housing." (DAB Staff Report, p. 2; DRB Staff Report, p.2.) Notwithstanding this, the Project seeks to avoid the very features it is obligated
to provide to enable pedestrian-friendly housing.

Re: Project No. 2020-16 (CityMark Communities LLC) - 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, CA

Dear Ms. Kinnard:

This law firm represents the St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California located at 5150 Wilson Street, directly adjacent to the La Mesa Woman's Club ("LMWC"), the site of a 49 residential unit and three commercial unit mixed-use project ("Project") proposed by CityMark Communities LLC ("CityMark") known as Project No. 2020-16. This correspondence is offered to inform the City of La Mesa ("City") of our client's grave concerns regarding the proposed Project, the limited conditions recommended to ensure the health and safety of the public, and the apparent lack of analysis of the Project's expected impacts.
We also wish to bring to the City's attention that on December 17, 2020 this firm requested to be placed on the notice list for all public hearings relating to the Project, and specifically those relating to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Notwithstanding this, we were only sent notice of the March 8, 2021, 12:30 p.m. Design Review Board ("DRB") meeting after regular work hours, at 8:10 p.m., on Thursday, March 4, 2021 (see Attachment "1"), indicating that the City requires audio/visual presentations by the public to be submitted by "12:00 noon, one
business day prior to the start of the meeting." It would be practically impossible to prepare and transmit any presentation, let alone a thoughtful one, within three regular working hours of receipt of said notice (i.e., after 9 a.m. on March 5, 2021) to comply with the City's stated deadline. What is more, no notice was sent to this office of the March 8, 2021, 10 a.m. Development Advisory Board ("DAB") meeting though we understand that an exemption to CEQA analysis is to be voted on in this hearing. In fact, it is solely due to our client's diligence in searching the City's website, at approximately 11:15 am on March 5, 2021, that we learned of the DAB meeting at all - again, making it impossible to provide the City with an audio/visual presentation by the 12:00 noon deadline set for that same day.
We understand that COVID-19 has altered the conditions by which we all live and work, and that the City is permitted to avoid direct communications from the public during such hearings

approval of projects, we strongly recommend the City reconsider its current practices. It does not appear that the composition of the DAB, nor the Design Review Board, afford any semblance of an impartial determination on matters of great importance to the public. Rather, these bodies appear to act as "rubber-stamps" on staff decisions. At the very least, the Council should consider having municipal attorney staff each such meeting to protect the City's interests, and those of
the community.

the public health, safety of welfare will result." Such a review specifically calls out the City's responsibility to use its judgment in deliberating whether to approve the Project's Site
Development Plan.

Moreover, Mr. Kusiak's declaration that the Project is "by-right" does not comport with CEQA. CEQA specifically does not apply to ministerial projects. (Public Resources Code § 21080(b).) The very fact that the DAB sought to approve an exemption from CEQA pursuant to Guideline section 15332 indicates that the Project is discretionary in that a CEQA exemption is
not applicable to ministerial projects.
CEQA is intended to provide the public, and decisionmakers, with accurate information
about the nature and full scope of development. (County of Inyo V. City of Los Angeles (1977)
71 Cal. App. 3d 185, 192.) Providing inaccurate information, misleading the public, and other decisionmakers, as to their rights to review and analyze the Project is a disservice to the community and discourages thoughtful discussion necessary to shape a discretionary development review. (Id. [an "accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an informative and legally sufficient" review under CEQA.].) The inaccurate description of the Project must be corrected to comply with CEQA.
Similarly, Mr. Kusiak stated that the DAB had no authority to deny the Project's requested
waiver under the State Density Bonus Law due to health and safety concerns (raised, largely, with respect to the dangerous traffic-related conditions at the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and
Wilson Street). This, too, is an incorrect statement of the law and the scope of the City's authority
to review the Project under CEQA. As indicated in our March 8, 2021 letter to the DAB, Government Code section 65915(e)(1) specifically provides that waivers of development standards under the State Density Bonus Law should not be granted when they would result in "specific, adverse impact.. upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact." Though the
DAB (and the DRB), as well as the City staff report, acknowledge that the Project's waivers result
in specific, adverse impacts upon health, safety, and the physical environment without offer of
satisfactory mitigation, due to the claimed exemption from CEQA, with respect to public realm
improvements (resulting in hazardous traffic conditions), parking space size and drive aisle
standards (resulting in hazardous traffic and parking conditions), open space standards, landscaping standards, and other deviations from development standards, these waivers were approved due to an inaccurate statement of the law claiming that the DAB could not deny the waivers under circumstances where specific, adverse impacts to health and safety are expressly acknowledged to exist. In light of this, the Project's waivers must be reconsidered and its impacts on the environment reviewed to determine what mitigation measures may be imposed.
Further, in light of the rampant inaccuracies, misstatements of law, and impropriety of appointing City staff (i.e., the Community Development Director, City Engineer, Building Division Director, and Fire Marshal) to review staff recommendations, and afford discretionary

PWM446

Making matters worse, Mr. Kusiak, also a Design Review Board member, declared that the traffic report required of the Project would not be prepared until the Applicant provided "construction drawings" for the development - such construction drawings are submitted when seeking building permits, well after the Project's discretionary entitlements have been considered and issued by the City. This, too, runs afoul of CEQA in that mitigation measures, and analyses, studies, and reports required to develop such measures in light of expected environmental impacts
may not be deferred. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4(a)(1)(B).)
2) Throughout the DAB hearing, Mr. Kusiak incorrectly declared that the Project was a "by- right" development. A "by-right" development means the Project cannot be reviewed in a discretionary manner but must instead by approved ministerially. This is incorrect and runs afoul of CEQA in that it provides an inaccurate description of the Project likely to mislead the public, and other decisionmakers, as to their rights and the scope of analysis owed the Project under the
law.

The California Supreme Court recently opined on this very issue clarifying the difference between discretionary and ministerial projects:
A permit issuance decision can be discretionary or ministerial depending on the circumstances. Those terms are defined in the CEQA Guidelines. A project is discretionary when an agency is required to exercise judgment or deliberation in deciding whether to approve an activity. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15357.) It is distinguished from a ministerial project, for which the agency merely determines whether applicable statutes, ordinances, regulations, or other fixed standards have been satisfied. (Ibid.) Ministerial projects are those for which "the law requires [an] agency to act ... in a set way without allowing the agency to use its own judgment.." (CEQA Guidelines, cop 15002, subd. (i)(1).) They involve "little or no personal judgment by the public official as to the wisdom or manner of carrying out the project. The public official merely applies the law to the facts as presented but uses no special discretion or judgment in reaching a decision." (CEQA Guidelines,
§ 15369.) [Protecting Our Water & Environmental Resources v. County of Stanislaus
(2020) 10 Cal.5th 479, 489.]
On its face, the Project requires the approval of a Site Development Plan in light of its MU zoning. (DAB staff report, page 2 ['"Entitlement review for new development in the MU zone involves site development plan review by the Development Advisory Board and design review by the Design Review Board, subject to City Council ratification."] The La Mesa Municipal Code, at section 24.02.034, further indicates that the review of a Site Development Plan is a discretionary process subject to approval, approval with conditions or denial, upon determining the project findings to be satisfactory and the City's design objectives are met, to ensure "that no detriment to

Director, Kerry Kusiak's attempt to waive this legal impropriety by arguing that the $5,000 contribution to street improvements is a feature of the a Project rather than a condition imposed by the City runs counter to the plain language of the approval - the fair-share contribution is "a condition of approval" (staff report, page 5), and "[t]he applicant shall provide a fee in-lieu of $5,000 [sic] for construction of an ADA compliant curb ramp at the southeast corner of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street" (DAB Resolution No. DAB-2021-xx, at page 4, Engineering Condition of Approval #21).
Moreover, the argument that this $5,000 contribution is feature of the Project offered by the Applicant, rather than a mitigation measure imposed by the City, is patently absurd. The Applicant repeatedly indicates, in its own words, when
(improperly) seeking waivers under the State Density Bonus Law, that the Project would be financially infeasible due to "cost impacts" if it were to meet the City's development standards (see staff report, Attachment E, pages 2-5) - so, the Council would have to believe that the Applicant is claiming financial difficulty and simultaneously giving away cash to the City even though it was under no obligation to do so (and that there no Project impact to this intersection dictate the imposition of a mitigation measure). Such efforts to avoid CEQA must be avoided as an affront
to the community this Council and its staff serve.

As further described in our March 8, 2021 (Exhibit "B"), this mitigation measure also runs afoul of the basic tenet of CEQA jurispradence that payment into a fair-share fee is only permissible if the fees are "part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency commits itself to implementing.' (Anderson First Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130
Cal.App.4th 1173, 1187.) There appears to be no such plan, commitment, nor funds to implement, the construction of a crosswalk across Grossmont Boulevard at Wilson Street, nor any indication as to how the $5,000 condition of approval was determined to result in a "fair-share" of the overall expense in light of the Project's impacts - this is, of course, because there has been no lawful
review of the Project's impacts at this intersection in direct violation of CEQA.

The City's Design Review Board, also on March 8, 2021, conditioned the Project's
approval on the Applicant's provision of a. traffic analysis to prove that the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street was inherently dangerous requiring deviation from the City's standard public realm improvements in the Mixed Use ("MU") zone. This condition indicates that the Applicant specifically seeks a waiver of required development standards due to a hazardous condition to health and safety at this intersection (i.e., by adding numerous new pedestrians, bicycles, and vehicles). Whether the waiver is granted, or not, the fact remains that the City acknowledges the Project will generate impacts at this intersection requiring review and mitigation measures such that a categorical CEQA exemption may not be approved in light of CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c).

ramps and crosswalks." The Applicant's traffic engineer, during the public comment portion of the DAB hearing, indicated that the Project would install a crosswalk across Grossmont Boulevard. Yet, an examination of the Project plans, as reflected in the staff report, indicates no such street improvements are offered, nor is the City's approval conditioned on the installation of a safe, signalized crosswalk at this intersection - though it is well understood to be a dangerous location a in light of the curvature of the street and speed of the automobiles moving through the area. Instead, the staff report, at page 5, provides "[a]s a condition of approval, the applicant will pay fair-share contribution towards crosswalk improvements to the intersection.3 a Such a mitigation measure is improper in the following respects (beyond those points made in our March 8. 2021 comment letter
to the DAB): a. First, the imposition of this condition of approval shows the DAB, and city staff, recognize the intersection requires a crosswalk in light of the Project's addition of 49 households of new residents, and the additional pedestrian traffic expected from the Project's three retail spaces, directly accessing the Grossmont Shopping Center for shopping or parking purposes (the latter especially, in light of the Project's deficient parking space supply). This dangerous condition (i.e., no safe crosswalk, stop signs, or signals) will be heightened by the addition of dozens, if not hundreds, of additional individuals trying to cross Grossmont Boulevard on a daily basis - a clear and unmistakable impact requiring review and mitigation under CEQA. Yet, the DAB approved an exemption from CEQA review declaring that there is no reasonable possibility that a significant impact exists pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c). This determination does not comport with the facts, nor the City's determination that a condition on the Project is required to contribute towards the safety of this intersection. On this basis alone, the DAB's approval of a categorical exemption is without merit.
b. Second, the DAB's approval of a fair-share contribution, on its face, indicates that the City expects other neighboring future developments to contribute to the correction of the unsafe conditions at the Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street intersection due to the foreseeable addition of more pedestrians and vehicles due to residential and commercial development in the area. This, too, indicates that the cumulative impact exception found at CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(b) ("All [categorical] exemptions... are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.") applies, such that the DAB could not lawfully approve a exemption to this Project. categorical CEQA
c. Third, the imposition of a mitigation measure, such as condition requiring a street improvement, or payment of a fair-share contribution toward such an improvement, inherently indicates that the Project is expected to result in a significant impact. In such an instance, no categorical CEQA exemption may be granted. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102.)

Re: Appeal of March 8, 2021 Development Advisory Board Determination Regarding Project
No. 2020-16

Dear Ms. Wiegelman:

This correspondence shall serve as a request to appeal the March 8, 2021 City of La Mesa (*City") Development Advisory Board ("DAB") approval of the CityMark Communities LLC (*Applicant") development project, and exemption from the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California, also known as Project No. 2020-16 (the
"Project').

Appeal of DAB Determination

Pursuant to La Mesa Municipal Code sections 2.08.051 and 24.02.035, this firm, acting on
behalf of its client, St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California ("St. Luke's") located at 5150 Wilson Street, hereby timely appeals the DAB's March 8, 2021 approval of the Project and its exemption from review under CEQA, and attaches a check in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00) (a copy of which is presented with the electronic version of the correspondence as Exhibit "A"). As the neighboring property owner representing the interests of its congregation as well as the community at large, St. Luke's files this appeal in light of specific violations of CEQA, the La Mesa Municipal Code, including but not limited to the Project's zoning requirements and concomitant development standards, the California State Density Bonus Law (Government Code § 65915 et seq.), and the City's General Plan as iterated in the letter delivered to the DAB on March 8, 2021 and attached hereto as Exhibit "B."
In addition, certain representations made at the subject DAB hearing indicate that the Project is further violative of the law. We lay several of these issues out below:
1) In expectation of the Project's residents accessing the Grossmont Shopping Center directly across Grossmont Boulevard, the City's staff report to the DAB, at page 2, acknowledges that the "intersection [of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street] is not signalized and is lacking curb

Hollywoodland Specific Plan v City of Los Angeles (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1187; McQueen v Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1148; Lewis v Seventeenth District Agricultural Association (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 823, 211.)
In light of these facts, the City cannot use a categorical exemption to avoid further analysis of the Project and must proceed to prepare an initial study followed by the preparation of a mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report permitting the public and the City's decisionmakers a thoughtful and reasoned opportunity to examine the totality of the Project and its potential impacts.

III. Conclusion

The City has failed to provide the public with a substantive opportunity to participate in a public forum regarding this Project in light of the inadequate (and with respect to the DAB, non- existent) notice, along with the practical impossibility of petitioning the government with a fulsome expression of the public's interests and grievances with regard to the development. The sharply limited deadlines needlessly imposed on the public do not comport with the law.
Further, the Project does not comply with the City's General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, the State Density Bonus Law, nor CEQA. In all, this Project must be sent back for significant further revisions and review.

We further note that the church is now engaged in a quiet title action with the LMWC,' before the superior court, over the church's driveway to resolve the ownership, possession, and control of this area. Should the court determine that the church is the title owner of the land, the Project's total size will be sharply reduced resulting in a significant reduction in its base density, as well as any density bonus which may be afforded to it under the current proposal. Moreover, the Project seeks to install a tall retaining wall along this driveway, which will not be permissible upon the church securing explicit title in this land. And, the Project plans show that the church's driveway is being improperly shown a as a fire truck access road during times of emergency though it does not offer access to the Project site given the steep slope separating the properties. In light of this, we strongly recommend the City hold back any decision which may result in confusing these issues or bringing the City into the action unnecessarily.

I We note the DRB and DAB Staff Reports both inaccurately claim that the Project site at 5220 Wilson Street is owned by CityMark. It is, in fact, owned solely by the LMWC according to the church's latest information.

throughout the site's development both before (during demolition) and long past (during construction) the grading operations. The noise from all of this construction will flow unimpeded into the directly adjacent school and playground disrupting hundreds of children's' education for what is likely to be a period of one to two years. (3) Hazardous materials disposal during construction. The LMWC building was
constructed prior to the elimination of asbestos-containing materials, lead-based paints, and polychlorinated biphenyls, yet no analysis has been made of these hazards (or methods to mitigate these potential hazards) upon adjacent residents, churchgoers, senior living facility residents, and/or schoolchildren. (4) Hydrology and water quality impacts from the developed Project. The church's experts have analyzed the existing site, and the proposed Project at build-out, and determined that the Project's drainage study inaccurately describes the conditions such that considerably more stormwater is expected to flow onto the church property than
reported. (5) Transportation impacts from construction and the developed Project. These impacts include significant numbers of heavy-haul trucks going through Wilson Street (designated a local collector) interrupting regular traffic and parking along the road, as well as church and school pick-ups and drop-offs, and a failure to follow the current standard in traffic analysis under CEQA, namely a vehicle miles traveled (VMT) analysis pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15064.3. And as indicated above, the analysis indicates the dangers inherent in the intersection at Grossmont Boulevard and
Wilson Street.

But for the Project's hydrology and water quality analyses, the church's expert analyses on the remaining impact categories described above remain the only information in the administrative record such that the City cannot simply overlook the described potentially significant impacts. Neither the Project applicant, nor the City itself, have made any attempt to respond to these expert analyses such that CEQA requires that an initial study be prepared. (Hansen Brothers Enterprises, Inc. v. Board of Supervisors (1996) 12 Cal.4th 533, 560 [standing for the proposition that undisputed evidence in the administrative record must be relied upon.].) Until such time as the Project applicant, or the City, rebut the evidence presented by the church's experts, and with respect to certain issues, the testimony, and opinions of laypersons, those remain the only materials upon which the City may rely in determining whether the exemption to CEQA under Guidelines section 15332 may be effective.
Under CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c), "[a] categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." Such an exception to CEQA Guidelines section
15332 exists in the administrative record in light of church's undisputed expert testimony as to impact categories described above. The City may not ignore evidence of an unusual circumstance creating a reasonable possibility of a significant environmental impact. (Committee to Save the

A. 'The City May Not Apply The In-Fill Development Exemption In Light Of The Project's Expected, and Known, Potentially Significant Impacts
The City proposes to avoid CEQA review of the Project by employing the In-Fill Development exemption found at CEQA Guidelines section 15332. This exemption provides that in-fill development may avoid CEQA analysis if:
(a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations. (b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses. (c) The project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species.
(d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality. (e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.
Our client has secured all Project materials the City purports to have in its possession or control via the California Public Records Act ("CPRA"). In securing this data, it has become readily obvious that very little analysis of the Project's potentially significant impacts to the environment have been performed to date. In fact, the only data in the administrative record analyzing the Project under CEQA has been provided by our client's environmental experts. These analyses, and the records produced pursuant to the above-mentioned CPRA request, indicate that though CityMark submitted an "Environmental Assessment/Initial Study Application" the City has performed no analysis of its own and has no Initial Study to indicate whether further environmental review must occur. Moreover, the expert analyses provided by our client, concretely and definitively specifies potentially significant impacts in the following CEQA categories:

(1) Air quality impacts arising from construction. This is especially important in that the Project proposes significant grading -"400 cubic yards of excavation (cut) and 1,400 cubic yards of fill... primarily used to raise the rear of the site to establish a pad for the parking area [along with].... [a] retaining wall of up to eight and a half feet in height is planned along the south end of the parking area". which is directly adjacent to the area where 125 students currently attend the Warren Walker School, on the church campus. These students are sensitive receptors, spending time outdoors to learn and play, and with open windows, especially during the COVID-19 era, to provide additional ventilation limiting disease spread. (2) Noise impact arising from construction. Again, much like the air impacts category, directly above, but likely to last significantly longer as the construction noise will exist

While the Guidelines provide opportunities for projects to be exempted from CEQA review, these exemptions are limited in nature. "Only those projects having no significant effect on the environment are categorically exempt from CEQA review." (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network, supra, at p. 1102.) A significant effect is a "substantial, or potentially
substantial, adverse change in the environment." (Pub. Res. Code §21068. [Emphasis added.]) This means that an activity has a significant effect if, among other things, it "has the potential to degrade the quality of the environment." (Pub. Res. Code § 21083.) "[A]n activity that may have a significant effect on the environment cannot be categorically exempt." (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 124. [Emphasis added.])
The courts review categorical exemptions using strict construction in a manner affording the greatest environmental protection within the reasonable scope of the statutory language. (County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 966.) • "[E]xemption categories are not to be expanded or broadened beyond the reasonable scope of their statutory language." (Dehne v. County of Santa Clara (1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 827, 842.) Thus, an exemption must be applicable in light of the full scope of a project.
A public agency has the burden of proving that substantial evidence supports its factual finding that a project falls within the asserted exemption. (Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose, 54 Cal. App. 4th 106, 114-115 (1997); Magan v. County of Kings (2002) 105 Cal.App.4th 468, 475.) "An agency's duty to provide such factual support "is all the more important where the record shows .that opponents of the project have raised arguments regarding possible significant environmental impacts.' (Muzzy Ranch Co. v. Solano County Airport Land Use Com. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 372, 386.) A city cannot impose a burden on the public to prove a possibility of adverse environmental impacts since this would frustrate CEQA's fundamental purpose of ensuring that
government officials "make decisions with environmental consequences in mind." (Davidon Homes, supra, at p. 116; California Farm Bureau Federation v. California Wildlife Conservation Bd. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 186.) "[T]he agency's exemption determination must be supported by evidence in the record demonstrating that the agency considered possible environmental impacts in reaching its decision."(Davidon Homes, supra, at p. 117; East Peninsula Ed. Council, Inc. v. Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School Dist. (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 155, 171.)
The record before the City, limited as it is because of the lack of analysis performed by CityMark, reveals that the Project's potential effects on the environment make the application of a categorical exemption legally inappropriate. In fact, most of the environmental analysis performed, to date, has been by the church's experts and those analysis have not been challenged, nor apparently analyzed by the City.

which has been in place a for over half a century and, thus, conflicts directly and inarguably with this policy.
6) Objective UD-3.1 requires that development be "architecturally and environmentally sensitive and ...compatible with neighboring design and scale." As indicated in the discussions regarding Policy LU-1.2.2 and Policy LU-2.1.2 directly above, the Project is unlike anything in this neighborhood, especially with respect to its design and scale, and therefore, conflicts with this objective of the General Plan,
In short, the Project cannot be said to be in harmony with the City's General Plan Land Use and Urban Design Element as proposed. As such, it must be revised significantly to come into conformance with the General Plan, and the surrounding community.

II. The Project Fails To Comply With The California Environmental Quality Act
The primary purposes of CEQA are to inform City decisionmakers, as well as the public, about the potential impacts of a project, and a to prescribe mitigation measures to avoid such impacts. CEQA requires a broad view of what constitutes a project requiring environmental analysis. (McQueen v. Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1143.) Even projects that appear benign will likely fall within the ambit of CEQA. (Bloom v. McGurk (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1307, 1312.) The California State Legislature formulated CEQA to "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of the environment shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions." (Pub. Res. Code §21001(d).) To implement this goal, CEQA requires municipalities to analyze discretionary projects for potential environmental impacts utilizing a three-tier system. (No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 74.) The first tier is known as a preliminary review. The preliminary review requires public agency staff to a analyze a complete application in order to discern the full scope of the project at issue. (CEQA Guidelines section 15060(b); City of Pasadena v. The State of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 810, 836.) Once the parameters of the project are established, a determination is made to resolve whether an exemption is applicable to the project. If such an exemption is found, the agency must determine that no exceptions to the exemption are triggered by the potential impacts from the full scope of the project. (CEQA Guidelines §§ 15060, 15061.) If the project is not exempt from CEQA, or an exception is applicable, the second tier of review is required wherein an initial study is prepared because it has been determined that there is a possibility that the project may have a significant effect on the environment. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063.) An initial study facilitates environmental assessment early in the design of a project. (CEQA Guidelines { 15063(c).) In the third tier, the initial study is used to demonstrate that either: a) the project "will not have a significant effect," triggering the preparation of a negative declaration, or b) the project is one "which may have a significant effect on the environment," triggering the preparation of an environmental impact report ("EIR"). (CEQA Guidelines § 15064.)

elements." (Resource Defense Fund v. County of Santa Cruz (1982) 133 Cal.App.3rd 800, 806.) CEQA imposes an obligation on La Mesa to assess the Project's consistency with the City's General Plan. (North Coast Rivers Alliance et al. v. Marin Municipal Water District (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 614, 633.) The Project, as designed and proposed, cannot be found to be consistent with the Land Use and Urban Design Element of the City's General Plan.

By way of example:

1) Policy LU-1.2.2 requires that "[a]s part of the development review process, City departments will review all future development to ensure that safety requirements are met, including building and fire codes, accessibility standards and crime prevention techniques. Yet, as indicated above, the City's failure to ensure that the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street indicates that no such review has been performed (or that, if it has, the requirement
to ensure safety has been obviated) such that a dangerous condition not only is permitted to exist, but it is being worsened by increasing the vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the area while also attempting to authorize a large development where a single-story structure currently exists, further reducing sight lines a on a dangerous curve in the road. Similarly, the proposed waivers to reduce parking space dimensions and drive aisle widths do not "ensure that safety requirements are met, including building and fire codes, [nor] accessibility standards."
2) Policy LU-2.1.2 requires the City to "[s]upport infill development and subdivision proposals that reinforce neighborhood strengths and benefit neighborhood identity," yet the Project proposes a development which is so different in character and intensity from any other in the neighborhood, both with respect to its architectural style and the materials used on its exterior walls - none of which can be found elsewhere in this community. Thus, it cannot be said that this Project will "reinforce" the existing visual appeal of the community.
3) Policy LU-2.1.5 requires the implementation of projects in the "Mixed-Use Overlay Zone by promoting the rehabilitation of properties and new development that fits into the context of the existing neighborhoods while meeting the City's Urban Design Objectives for infill development." Again, as noted directly above, in #2, the Project is completely out of character and context with respect to the existing neighborhood such that this policy cannot be met.
4) Policy LU-4.2.3 requires that "[n]ew development shall provide adequate
parking.' As the Project specifically seeks to not only reduce parking space numbers below the City's normal standards, it also seeks to reduce the number below those permitted under the State Density Bonus Law (albeit, improperly attempting to do SO via a waiver, as indicated in the immediately preceding two sections of this letter). Also, as indicated in the immediately preceding section, the Project does not provide adequate parking not only with respect to the reduced number of spaces it proposes, but also improperly attempts to reduce the dimensions of the spaces and the drive aisles around them in a manner likely to impact the public's (and future residents') health and safety. Thus, the Project clearly conflicts with this policy as well.
5) Objective UD-I.1 requires the City's "It]o protect La Mesa's existing built environment and cultural heritage." But the Project proposes to destroy the LMWC clubhouse

B. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Not Permitted To Overcome Regulations That Pertain To Health And Safety

As mentioned above, the Project's requests for waivers are inapposite to the law because they pertain to financial rather than physical constraints. In addition, the Project improperly seeks to waive the City's standard parking space and driving aisle dimensions even though this would result in direct health and safety impacts. Waivers are impermissible on this basis as well.

The dimensions of parking spaces and adjacent driving aisles are specified to ensure the safety of vehicles, their drivers and passengers, and pedestrians. (LMMC § 22.112.010(B).) This makes common sense - if spaces and driving aisles are too small; or otherwise constrained, they are likelier to lead to physical harm from other vehicles when vacating or entering a space and are the reason why State building codes requires minimum parking dimensions to ensure health and safety. (DAB Staff Report, p. 3 & Attachment D, pp. 3-4; DRB Staff Report, p. 3 & Attachment E, pp. 3-4.)
Government Code section 65915(e)(1) of the State Density Bonus Law provides:
Nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted to require local government to waive or reduce development standards if the waiver or reduction would have a specific, adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5, upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact.
[Emphasis added.]
a Thus, a waiver cannot be used to avoid the specific, adverse impact arising from the reduction of a basic safety feature inherent in parking stall/space sizes and driving aisle dimensions as contemplated by the Project due to the health and safety issues it raises. No justification exists which would be sufficient to overcome this requested reduction in health and safety standards, nor would an incentive permit such a thing. a
C. The Project, As Designed, Is Contrary To The Chief Land Use Policies Declared Under
The Land Use And Urban Design Element Of The General Plan
California law requires each city and county to adopt a general plan, a comprehensive long- term plan for the development of that city or county, famously referred to by the state Supreme Court as the "constitution for future development." (Lesher Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 540.) A general plan must contain seven mandatory "elements," including a "land use element" to designate the level of intensity and general distribution of land uses. (Gov. Code § 65302.) "[T]he propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development depends upon [a finding of] consistency with the applicable general plan and its

PWM430

Pursuant to Government Code §65915(e)(1), waivers (as opposed to incentives) are afforded to a density bonus project only when a "development standard will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development," not because the developer desires it, or because it will enhance the financial prospects of a project. Put another way, waiver permits deviation from, or altogether evasion of, regulations which affect a project due to its site-specific physical features. This subject site has no such physical constraints. Rather, the balconies could be built outside of the pedestrian realm (i.e., within the building envelope) by moving the exterior walls along Grossmont Boulevard back four feet, or removed altogether. The applicant itself makes clear that it is not a physical constraint that drives this waiver request when it states its
justification as follows:
This waiver is requested due to excessive space and cost impacts to incorporate the Open Space requirement and private balconies. The loss of development potential to incorporate this would make the project infeasible to provide the affordable units.
As mentioned above, the site itself does not have any physical obstruction which precludes construction of these balconies, rather CityMark simply desires to have them overhang the pedestrian realm because it would increase their financial incentive to develop the Project. The State Density Bonus Law permits this sort of deviation from regulation for financial gain through the use of incentives, of which the Project has two (waivers, on the other hand, are unlimited for such developments). Yet, the Project avoids using any of its incentives and instead improperly requests at least five waivers to avoid its open space requirements, building height limit, parking space sizing, landscaping required within the pedestrian realm, and overall parking requirements. In each such instance, CityMark indicates that the justification for the waiver is not a physical constraint unique to the site but rather the request is made to seek a financial boon for the
developer.
The reason the Project seeks to use waivers rather than incentives is clear on its face - the State Density Bonus Law does not authorize a sufficient number of incentives (i.e., the Project requires five, but only has two available to it) to meet CityMark's desired financial goals, whereas
it may request an unlimited number of waivers. Because it does not have sufficient incentives to develop the Project in this manner, it attempts to avoid their use altogether and instead make faulty justifications for waivers which are impermissible under the law.
Because CityMark cannot show a physical constraint exists which limits the development of the Project under the City's laws and policies, it must use its incentives (and justify the use of those incentives by showing the financial benefit gained thereby) and/or redesign the Project to be in conformity with the law.

§ 24.18.040(B).) The condition to pay a fee in lieu of an actual mitigation measure regarding a known project impact runs afoul of CEQA and should not be permitted. Rather the Project must be required to perform an analysis to determine the scope of the impact and to then propose a mitigation measure to reduce that impact to a less than significant level.
Moreover, this mitigation measure is improper on two other bases. First, it improperly attempts to defer mitigation until a later (and, in this case, unknown future) time. This is specifically forbidden under CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4 (a)(1)(B).) And second, a mitigation measure is only available if a project under CEQA is expected to generate a potentially significant impact on the environment, but the staff report indicates that the Project is exempt from CEQA because there are no such expected impacts. (DAB Staff Report, p. 7-8; see also DAB Staff Report, Attachment A, "Resolution No. DAB-2021-xx" at Par. 1.) So, either the Project is not exempt from CEQA and cannot be conditioned to mitigate a potentially significant impact, or it must be analyzed properly under CEQA (i.e., by preparation of an Initial Study, followed by specific impact category studies, and the development of a mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report). The status quo does not comport with the law. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102 [a public agency may not adopt mitigation measures for a project for the purpose of qualifying it for a categorical CEQA exemption; see also Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1200.)
A. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Limited To Overcoming Physical, Not Financial, Constraints Such That Avoiding Improvements To The Pedestrian Realm Are Not Permitted For This Project
As indicated above, the Project is designated Mixed Use Urban requiring improvements to the surrounding pedestrian realm. LMMC § 24.18.020(E) defines the term "pedestrian realm" as follows:

"Pedestrian realm" means a twelve-foot wide area located between the face of the
curb of a Circulation Element designated street and the face of the building. The pedestrian realm includes the parkway, sidewalk, and landscaped areas. The pedestrian realm may include both public and private property where the public right-of-way is not twelve feet wide. Pedestrian amenities, street trees, street furniture, bus stop facilities, and other landscaping, as specified in this chapter, shall be included in the public realm.
Notwithstanding this acknowledged requirement, "[w]aivers are being requested to allow reductions in... pedestrian realm requirements."(DAB Staff Report, p. 3; DRB Staff Report, p. 3.) For instance, the Project seeks a "waiver" under the State Density Bonus Law so that it may encroach four feet into the pedestrian realm along Grossmont Boulevard by installing balconies hanging over this right of way. This a miscomprehends what a waiver is under the law.

The Project sits under 100 feet away, directly across Grossmont Boulevard, from the Grossmont Shopping Center. The closest supermarket to the Project is the Walmart Neighborhood Market therein, lying approximately 350 feet away, yet because there is no crosswalk, stop sign, and/or traffic signal at the intersection of Wilson Street and Grossmont Boulevard, a resident of the Project would be required to walk about three-quarters of a mile to safely cross the street, pick up groceries, and return with them - it is doubtful many residents will be able to lug an average family's weekly groceries this distance, on foot. (DAB Staff Report, p. 2 [In fact, the City recognizes this failing at the beginning of its report, "The intersection is not signalized and is lacking curb ramps and crosswalks."]; see also DRB Staff Report at p. 2 for the same acknowledgment of a dangerous condition].) Notwithstanding this, it appears the Project is being permitted to avoid the development of a crosswalk which is absolutely necessary for its residents or, at least, providing an analysis showing the Project will generate significantly more average daily vehicular trips and vehicle miles traveled than contemplated.
The City failed to require a traffic analysis for the Project, though it initially sought to require an ADA-compliant ramp be constructed at this intersection before apparently dropping this condition altogether. Our client's environmental consultant has also indicated this intersection is particularly dangerous because of limited sightlines arising from a substantial curve in Grossmont Boulevard in this area. The observation that this particular intersection is dangerous has been voiced numerous times in correspondence submitted to the City by multiple parties. Yet the staff reports show that no ramp, crosswalk, or analysis was required of the Project- instead, the Project is conditioned to provide: $5,000 "fair-share" payment toward a ramp to be built by an unknown
party at an unknown time in the future. This does not comport with the law.
There appears to be no plan on file to develop a safe intersection at Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street, and the $5,000 payment does not appear to go towards any previously approved fund for that purpose. Nor is there any indication of how this figure was calculated. In Anderson First Coalition V. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173, the appellate court held that paying a "fair-share fee" is permissible as effective mitigation only if the fees are "part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency commits itself to implementing." That is not the case in this instance. In light of this, the City must require the installation of an
appropriately signalized intersection, or some other traffic calming feature here, or require the Project to present an analysis indicating why it should not do so. The only evidence in the administrative record, to date, on this topic shows that the City initially desired a crosswalk to be installed but backed off without explanation (or analysis available to the public, or the City's
decisionmakers).
"In MU areas, new development is required to include pedestrian realm improvements along collector streets to encourage pedestrian activity. The Circulation Element classifies
Grossmont Boulevard as a major collector street subject to pedestrian realm requirements." (DAB Staff Report, p. 2; DRB Staff Report, p. 2. [Emphasis added.]; see also La Mesa Municipal Code

in light of California Executive Order N-29-20. Yet, the failure to afford the public a practical a opportunity to review, analyze, and respond to the Project's 137-page DRB staff report and the 150-page DAB staff report does not comport with the public's statutory and constitutional rights to petition its government under the Ralph M. Brown Act. (Government Code 54950 et seq.; Cal. Const., Art. I § 3, subd. (a) and (b)(1), (7).) These actions run afoul of the law as they present limitations on public participation which are simply "too arbitrary and capricious, too restrictive and unreasonable." (Nevens v. Chino (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 775, 778; see also Robins V. Pruneyard Shopping Center (1979) 23 Cal.3d 899, 907 [The right of the people to petition the government for redress of grievances is "vital to a basic process in the state's constitutional scheme."].)

Furthermore, should CityMark, or its consultants, be permitted to present audio/visual materials to, or communicate directly with, the DAB or DRB boards during these hearings on March 8, 2021 it will only heighten the inequities inherent in providing late, or no, notice to the public, with regard to the respective rights of the parties to petition their government. This would be an unfortunate, and likely unlawful, action in unequal treatment under both state and federal statutes and constitutions, A more reasoned action would be to postpone each of the DAB and DRB hearings by a week, or more, to permit each party, and the public more generally, an opportunity to present their positions thoughtfully.
Notwithstanding this, we offer a limited summary of our client's position with respect to the proposed Project in the hopes that it will be presented to the DAB and DRB board members for review prior to any discussion of, or determination on, this matter. In light of the severely constrained time available to us before the DAB and DRB meetings, we will not reiterate each of the points made in prior communications and correspondence delivered to the City in opposition to the Project but join in those comments by this reference. Rather, we will focus briefly on the inadequate analysis of the Project in light of the City's General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, the Project's inapt use of California State Density Bonus Law (Gov. Code § 65915 et seq.) waivers, and the impropriety of the claimed CEQA exemption under Guidelines section 15332.

I. The Project Runs Afoul Of The General Plan's Urban Design Element And The Zoning Ordinance
As the staff reports to each of the DAB and DRB indicate, the Project site is designated as "Mixed Use Urban," corresponding to the Mixed Use (MU) Overlay, in the Residential Business base zone and is intended to support "pedestrian friendly housing.' (DAB Staff Report, p. 2; DRB Staff Report, p.2.) Notwithstanding this, the Project seeks to avoid the very features it is obligated to provide to enable pedestrian-friendly housing.

Re: Project No. 2020-16 (CityMark Communities LLC) - 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, CA

Dear Ms. Kinnard:
This law firm represents the St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California located at 5150 Wilson Street, directly adjacent to the La Mesa Woman's Club ("LMWC"), the site of a 49 residential unit and three commercial unit mixed-use project ("Project") proposed by CityMark Communities LLC ("CityMark") known as Project No. 2020-16. This correspondence is offered to inform the City of La Mesa ("City") of our client's grave concerns regarding the proposed Project, the limited conditions recommended to ensure the health and safety of the public, and the apparent lack of analysis of the Project's expected impacts.
We also wish to bring to the City's attention that on December 17, 2020 this firm requested to be placed on the notice list for all public hearings relating to the Project, and specifically those relating to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Notwithstanding this, we were only sent notice of the March 8, 2021, 12:30 p.m. Design Review Board ("DRB") meeting after regular work hours, at 8:10 p.m., on Thursday, March 4, 2021 (see Attachment "1"), indicating that the City requires audio/visual presentations by the public to be submitted by "12:00 noon, one business day prior to the start of the meeting." It would be practically impossible to prepare and transmit any presentation, let alone a thoughtful one, within three regular working hours of receipt of said notice (i.e., after 9 a.m. on March 5, 2021) to comply with the City's stated deadline. What is more, no notice was sent to this office of the March 8, 2021, 10 a.m. Development Advisory Board ("DAB") meeting though we understand that an exemption to CEQA analysis is to be voted on in this hearing. In fact, it is solely due to our client's diligence in searching the City's website, at approximately 11:15 am on March 5, 2021, that we learned of the DAB meeting at all - again, making it impossible to provide the City with an audio/visual presentation by the 12:00 noon deadline set for that same day.
We understand that COVID-19 has altered the conditions by which we all live and work, and that the City is permitted to avoid direct communications from the public during such hearings

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM408

1

2 of Government Code § 54954.3. ST. LUKE'S was prejudiced by the DAB's

üe cn unreasonable and unnecessary limitation on its inability to communicate its
concerns regarding the Project during the Hearing. On the same date as the

Hearing, as well as before and after this, the DAB has repeatedly limited the
public's ability to petition their government in favor of project applicants, but

N9 without any legal or technical basis to do so; and
b. Because the DAB consists solely of senior CITY department officials that had
previously reviewed, and extensively discussed (concurrently amongst

10 themselves, serially, and/or through their respective subordinates who would later

=s's report to them) the Project, its CEQA exemption claims, and the conditions they
intended to place on the Project, the Hearing was little more than a sham
perpetrated on the remotely viewing, but silenced, public. On the same date as the

14 Hearing, as well as before and after this, the DAB's members reviewed and

15 unlawfully discussed other projects the DAB was required to review and vote

16 upon in public hearings pursuant to the Brown Act and the California Constitution
at Article I, Section 3.

17 37. ST. LUKE'S timely objected to the above-described violations of the Brown Act and
18 the California Constitution, through the Demand, and pursuant to Gov Code §§ 54960, 54960.1 and
19 54960.2 sought cure or corrective action.

20 38. The CITY COUNCIL failed to timely take up the Demand and further failed to timely
21 prepare and transmit to ST. LUKE'S an unconditional commitment, in writing, that it would cure or
22 correct each and every one of the violations raised in the Demand as to the Project, its CEQA
23 exemption, and all other projects reviewed prior to, or after, the Hearing
24 COUNCIL failed to make any such unconditional commitment and now in fact, the CITY

25 itself in a manner contrary to that required under the Brown Act. appears to desire to absolve

26 39. ST. LUKE'S has a clear, present, and beneficial interest in Respondents' compliance
27 with the Brown Act, and the California Constitution, Art. I, § 3.

PWM407

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 29. ST. LUKE'S realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 28 above,
3 as though set forth herein in their entirety.

4 30. The Hearing was "a regular meeting" under the Brown Act requiring notice pursuant
5 to Gov. Code $ 54954. cop

6 31. ST. LUKE'S requested the CITY to provide notice of all public hearings relating to
7 the Project, pursuant to Gov. Code § 54954.1, and all related CEQA matters, pursuant to 14 Cal.
8 Code Regs. § 15087 ("CEQA Guidelines" § 15087(a).)

32. Because the Project is sited directly adjacent to ST. LUKE'S church, the CITY was
10 also required to provide ST. LUKE'S with notice of the Project's CEQA hearing before the DAB
11 pursuant to CEQA Guideline 15087(a)(3).

12 33. Though the CITY informed the Project applicant of the date and time of the Hearing |
13 weeks in advance of its March 8, 2021 date, the CITY failed to provide timely notice to ST. LUKE'S
14 church of the Hearing.

15 34. This lack of notice limited ST. LUKE'S, and the public's, participation in the Hearing
16 and mislead these parties about the Project which the CITY knew to be known to be of great concern
17| to the neighboring community.

18 35. ST. LUKE'S was prejudiced by these noticing violations under the Brown Act and the
19 Cal. Const., Art. I, 3, because it was left with insufficient time to conduct an investigation into the
20 Project and the CITY's analysis of the Project as well as the associated CEQA exemption and was,
21 therefore, unable to fully participate in the Hearing.

22 36. In addition to the above-described violations, the DAB also committed the following
23 additional violations of the Brown Act and the California Constitution:

24 a. Though the DAB had the technical ability and time to afford the Project applicant,

25 and its consultants, unlimited and direct communications during the Hearing, it

26 limited ST. LUKE'S, and the public's, ability to petition their government by only

27 permitting the first three hundred (300) words of their comments to be read into

28 the record with respect to the Project and its CEQA exemption claims in violation

https://www.cityoflamesa.us/DocumentCenter/View/17386/DAB-Packet-2021-05-24-Final,

7 hereto as Exhibit "J".

26. ST. LUKE'S is further informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the CITY
COUNCIL had not taken up the Demand within thirty (30) days of its transmittal nor proffered a
10 writing in response to the Demand indicating whether it would act to cure or correct any or all of the

11 alleged violations of the Brown Act made therein.

12 27. ST. LUKE'S is further informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the CITY
13 COUNCIL will consider the dissolution of the DAB at its May 25, 2021 public meeting, but that said
14 consideration is not to include contemplation, or further direction, the CITY COUNCIL with respect
15 to the points raised in the Demand, including but not limited to the DAB's March 8, 2021 approval
16 of the Project and its CEQA exemption, as well as the validity of the DAB's determinations as to
17 other projects reviewed by the DAB both before and after the Project, and the alleged failures to
18 provide proper notice and to permit public participation as required under the Brown Act. A true and
19 correct copy of the City Manager's Report to the CITY COUNCIL for the May 25, 2021 public
20 meeting (Agenda Item #9) is attached hereto, and incorporated herein, as Exhibit "K",

21 28. Having exhausted all available administrative remedies, having been offered no
22 writing from the CITY COUNCIL indicating its intent to cure the alleged Brown Act violations set

23 forth in the Demand, and being informed and believing, and thereon alleging that the DAB continues
24 to act in violation of the Brown Act, compounding violative actions it has taken in the past and not
25 yet addressed, ST. LUKE'S now seeks redress because the Respondents' failure to provide legally
26 sufficient remedy demonstrates that such actions will continue unless this Court intervenes.

21. On or about May 6, 2021, ST. LUKE'S counsel directed an email to City

4 litigation. A true and correct copy of said email correspondence is attached hereto, and incorporated
5 herein, as Exhibit "F".

9 DAB, that City Attorney Sabine had directed that "new development applications in the future will
10 not be subject to DAB review," and offering a *redo' of the Hearing regarding the Project. A true

11 and correct copy of this letter is attached hereto, and incorporated herein, as Exhibit "G".

12 23. On or about May 11, 2021, ST. LUKE'S responded to City Attorney Sabine, via
13 email, indicating the insufficiency of the CITY's response to the Demand in light of the Brown Act
14 requirement that a legislative body, not the CITY staff, cure or correct the challenged actions and
15 inform ST. LUKE'S, in writing, within thirty (30) days of the Demand of the scope the actions taken

26 "I"

27 25. ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that, contrary to the claims

1 members but did not permit (or offer any opportunity for) ST. LUKE'S or the public to speak
2 directly to the DAB during the Hearing, though the Project applicant, and its several of its
3 consultants, conferred with the DAB for well over the span of an hour. The DAB took action
4 pursuant to Gov. Code § 54952.6 in approving the Project and finding the Project exempt from

5 CEQA review.

6 17. Since the Hearing, ST. LUKE'S has been informed and believes, and thereon alleges,
the DAB members are senior CITY department officials, including Community Development
8 Director Kerry Kusiak, City Engineer Leon Firsht, Building Division Director Aaron Sturm, and Fire
9 Marshal Steve Swaney, and that some or all of these DAB members met with one another, at times
10 serially and/or through intermediaries, to discuss the Project as to whether it should be approved, and
11 upon what conditions, if any, prior to the start of the Hearing.

12 18. On or about March 17, 2021, ST: LUKE'S submitted its timely appeal ("Appeal") of
13 the DAB's determination on the Project and its CEQA exemption to the CITY COUNCIL pursuant
14 to La Mesa Municipal Code (*LMMC") § 24.02.035. To date, the CITY COUNCIL has not set a
15 hearing for the Appeal, nor has the CITY communicated with ST. LUKE'S in any manner on this
16 issue other than to acknowledge receipt of the Appeal. A true and correct copy of the Appeal and the
17 communications with the CITY regarding said Appeal are attached hereto, and incorporated herein,
18 as Exhibit "D".

19 19. On or about April 7, 2021, ST. LUKE'S delivered to the CITY COUNCIL, through
20 the CITY CLERK, a demand to cure and correct alleged violations of the Brown Act ("Demand") as
21 to: (1) the DAB's Hearing's limitations on public participation, (2) the CITY's failure to provide
22 proper notice of the Hearing, (3) the DAB members' improper communications regarding the Project
23 prior to the Hearing, and (4) more generally, the DAB members' improper communications as to all
24 other applications before that legislative body. A true and correct of the Demand is attached hereto,
25 and incorporated herein, as Exhibit "E",

26 20. On or about May 4, 2021 and May 5, 2021, the La Mesa City Attorney, Glenn Sabine,
27 communicated, via telephone call and voicemails, with ST. LUKE'S counsel a desire to resolve the

2 matters thereto. On December 28, 2020, the City Clerk of the CITY acknowledged receipt of said
3 request by replying to the undersigned's email. A true and correct copy of this request for notice and

4 the CITY's reply is attached hereto, and incorporated herein, as Exhibit "A".

5 12. Notwithstanding said request for notice, the CITY provided no such notice as to its
6 Monday, March 8, 2021 Hearing. Instead, ST. LUKE'S learned of the Hearing at approximately
7 11:15 am (PST) on Friday, March 5, 2021 upon a perusing a CITY website on which a copy of the
8 notice was published. Said notice indicated that the CITY would permit two categories of speech to
9 be made to the DAB, those by members of the public whose comments "must be submitted to
10 planning@cityoflamesa.us... and be no more than 300 words" and those of development project
11 "[a]pplicants who wish to make an audio/visual presentation pertaining to an item on the agenda,'
12 with no explicit limitation on length. A true and correct copy of this DAB notice for the Hearing is
13 attached hereto, and incorporated herein, as Exhibit "B".

14 13. ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, the CITY provides several
15 weeks of notice leading up to the Hearing to the Project applicant.

16 14. ST. LUKE'S was not given sufficient notice to properly review and comment on the
17 CITY'S analysis of the Project (available at

18 (https://www.cityoflamesa.us/DocumentCenter/View/17152/DAB-2021-03-08), approximately one
19 hundred fifty six (156) pages in length, prior to said Hearing, in light of the CITY's failure to provide
20 sufficient and proper notice.

21 15. A 15-page comment letter, on behalf of ST. LUKE'S, was submitted to the DAB at
22 approximately 9:45 a.m. on March 8, 2021. Only the first three hundred (300) words of the comment
23| letter were read into the record by the CITY. The comment letter did not appear in the materials
24 presented to the DAB, nor was it made available to the public or the DAB for the Hearing. A true
25 and correct copy of ST. LUKE'S March 8, 2021 comment letter is attached hereto, and incorporated
26 herein, as Exhibit "C".

27 16. ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, the CITY read aloud the
28 first three hundred (300) words of comments on the Project from approximately twenty (20)

2 alleged, were acting with the scope of their authority as agents, employees, or authorized
3 representatives, and with the permission and/or consent of the other Respondents.

4 JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND STANDING

5 7. San Diego County Superior Court has initial jurisdiction over the matters alleged
6 herein pursuant to CCP § 1085, 1094.5, 1094.6, and 1095-1097; Civil Code § 3420, and Gov. Code
7 §§ 54960 and 54960.1.

8 8. Venue is proper within San Diego County pursuant to CCP §§ 392 and 394 because
9 the actions (and inactions) complained of occurred in the County of San Diego, State of California.

10 9. ST. LUKE'S has standing to assert the claims raised in this Verified Petition for Writ
11 of Mandate pursuant to Civil Code 8 1086, and Gov. Code §8 54960 and 54960.1. ST. LUKE'S, and
12 its congregation, have a stake in this matter and are affected by the decisions made by the
13 Respondents as explained below. ST. LUKE'S has a substantial, direct, and immediate interest in
14 assuring that Respondents fulfill their duties to comply with the Brown Act in making decisions
15 which affect La Mesa residents, and more specifically, ST. LUKE'S itself. ST. LUKE'S will suffer
16 significant loss if Respondents' actions (and inactions) in violation of the Brown Act are permitted to
17 stand.

18 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS COMMON TO ALL CAUSES OF ACTION

19 10. ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that on Monday, March 8,
20 2021, starting at approximately 10 am (PST), the DAB held a public hearing ("Hearing") with
21 respect to a proposed development (the "Project") of the property located at 5220 Wilson Street, La
22 Mesa, California - which site is directly adjacent to ST. LUKE'S church. This public hearing was
23 open to the public only through remote video conference (no in-person attendance was permitted
24 due to COVID-19 restrictions enforce by the CITY), and the public's, though not the Project
25 applicant's, or its consultants', input was limited to the CITY staff reading aloud up to the first three
26 hundred (300) words of comments submitted by members of the public.

27 11. Prior to this, on December 17, 2020, ST. LUKE'S, through its undersigned counsel,
28 requested, via email, the CITY notify him of all public hearings relating to the Project and any

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
PWM401

related matters of land use in the vicinity of ST. LUKE'S.

2. ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that at all relevant times
mentioned herein, Respondent DAB is, and was, a "legislative body" as defined in Gov. Code §
4 54952. Accordingly, ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that at all relevant l
5 times mentioned herein, the DAB is, and was, required to comply with all provisions contained in the

6 Brown Act.

3. ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that at all relevant times
8 mentioned herein, Respondent CITY COUNCIL is, and was, a "legislative body" as defined in Gov.
9 Code 8 54952. Accordingly, ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that at all
10 relevant times mentioned herein, the CITY COUNCIL is, and was, required to comply with all
11 provisions contained in the Brown Act.

13 mentioned herein, Respondent CITY is, a and was, a "local agency" as defined in Gov. Code § 54951.
14 Accordingly, ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that at all relevant times
15 mentioned herein, the CITY is, and was, required to comply with all provisions contained in the
16 Brown Act.

17 5. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, associate, or otherwise, l
18 of those Respondents sued as DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, are unknown to ST. LUKE'S and,
19 therefore, ST. LUKE'S sues them under fictitious names. ST. LUKE'S is informed and believes, and
20 thereon alleges, that at all relevant times mentioned herein, DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, are in

21 some manner or capacity, and to some degree, responsible and liable for damages and/or acts of
22 which ST. LUKE'S petitions this Court. When the true names and capacities of DOES 1 through 10,
23 inclusive, are determined and ascertained, ST. LUKE'S will seek leave of court to amend this
24 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate to state the true names and capacities of such fictionally named
25 DOE Respondents. On information and belief, ST. LUKE'S makes all allegations contained in this
26 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate against all Respondents, including DOES 1 through 10,

numerous discussions have transpired among City staff over the years regarding the elimination of the Development Advisory Board (DAB) for various reasons. Your correspondence has prompted City staff to begin the appropriate process for elimination (please see the attached emails between Kerry Kusiak, Director of Planning and Community Development and Greg Humora, City Manager). Furthermore, at my direction, new development applications in the
future will not be subject to DAB review. believe, this action should suffice to remedy any allegations of Brown Act violations that you
have asserted.

Also, because of the issues raised in your correspondence, if so requested by your Client, City staff would be happy to "redo" the March 8, 2021 DAB hearing on the development project planned at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California.
Please contact me with any questions, concerns or requests. Thank you and have a pleasant

Re: May 11, 2021 Correspondence-Brown Act Demand for Cure and Correction Regarding
Development Advisory Board

Dear Mr. Tinkov:

This correspondence addresses your correspondence referenced above. Perhaps further information will alay your Client's concerns regarding Brown Act Violations by the Development
Advisory Board (DAB). First, a draft ordinance eliminating the DAB is scheduled for
consideration by the La Mesa City Council on May 25, 2021 (agenda available on May 21, 2021) ("Ordinance"). Staff and the City Attorney's office will be recommending adoption. In La Mesa,
the Mayor and the City Manager set the Council agenda. My strong anticipation is that the Ordinance will be adopted. In that event, obviously, the City will seek to dismiss any Brown Act
lawsuit filed regarding the DAB and refuse any request related for Attorneys' fees.

Furthermore, as I mentioned in my earlier correspondence, at the City Attorney's directive, no
new development applications will be considered by the DAB pending the final outcome related
to the Ordinance.

Thank you for your consideration and I hope this information has been helpful.

Glenn,

Sorry I was unable to pick up the phone when you called today. I have some litigation and mediation deadlines to meet this week, so likely will not be able to talk today or tomorrow.

I understand that the La Mesa City Council has not made a determination as to whether it will cure and/or correct the deviations from the Brown Act specified in our April 7, 2021 correspondence - please correct me if some action has been taken, as l have received no notice of such action. My calendar shows that tomorrow, May 7, 2021, represents the last day upon which such a determination may be made, starting the 15-day clock for my client to file a petition for writ of mandate to seek the court's direction. As I will be out of town when this deadline runs, will be forced to file by April 21, 2021. I further understand from your voicemail, that you believe there may be some solution to this, or perhaps some other issues raised by St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California in its appeal of the Development Advisory Board's March 8, 2021 approval of the development proposal, and CEQA exemption thereto, at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, CA 91942.

My client welcomes workable resolutions to its claims, so I would ask that you get back to me by email with sufficient time to avoid litigation - there is, unfortunately, not much time to do so in light of the short deadlines imposed under the Brown Act - so that can quickly pass your suggestions along.

Regards,

Subject: RE: St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California

Good afternoon Glenn,

hope this message finds you well.
First, I must note an error in my message of May 6, 2021 below - I had mistakenly indicated that I would be required to a file a petition by April 21, 2021 which, of course, would be impossible. I had intended to say that because of previously planned travel, I would have to file by May 21, 2021.
With that out of the way, I have reviewed your letter and while I appreciate what appears to be an earnest desire on the part of Mr. Humora and Mr. Kusiak to eliminate the Development Advisory Board, this response to St. Luke's April 7, 2021 Brown Act Demand for Cure and Correction is legally deficient. The Brown Act requires that the legislative body (i.e., the City Council) review the asserted violations in such a demand and to take action. (See, for instance, Government Code Section 54960.1(c)(2) ["Within 30 days of receipt of the demand, the legislative body shall cure or correct the challenged action and inform the demanding party in writing of its actions to cure or correct or inform the demanding party in writing of in its decision not to cure or correct the challenged action."].)
Though Mr. Humora is the City Manager, and Mr. Kusiak is the Director of Planning and Community Development, I am
not aware of any statutory or caselaw which would indicate they have the authority to respond to a demand of this
nature in compliance with the Act. Of course, if you have some legal basis to believe otherwise, I look forward to reviewing the material. Failing this, and in light of what | understand to be inaction on the part of the City Council with respect to my client's allegations of improprieties under the Brown Act, St. Luke's is forced to proceed as indicated previously (and corrected above).

Sincerely,
Felix Tinkov

Thank you for your emall,

After discussions with the City Attorney, we both agree that your suggestlons regarding the DAB should be implemented. Therefore, in conjunction with the City Attorney's office (after consultation with the Mayor), I will be placing this matter on the Council agenda for its consideration as soon as possible, but no later than 30 days from today. Furthermore, at the direction of the City Attorney, as of today, no further new applications will be processed through the DAB. This action remedies any allegations of Brown Act violations regarding the DAB.

Greg, As We have discussed, the appellant's attorney in the Wilson Street project (2020-16) has also challenged the validity of the makeup of the Development Advisory Board (DAB) under the Brown Act. The challenge centers on the contention that the staff that make up the DAB (Director of Community Development, Director of Public Works, Building Official, and Fire Marshall) have serial meetings in violation of the Act. The attorney notes that the staff on the board necessarily interact outside of public meetings to perform the function of project review.
In this regard, 1 think the attorney may be on point. To remedy this situation, I suggest that the DAB be eliminated.as soon as possible and replaced with an administrative revlew process under the authority of the Community Development Director. The process could include some level of public review period of projects prior to a decision being made, with the possibility of appeal. Since the DAB was established by ordinance, an ordinance would be needed to amend the Zoning Code to remove the DAB and insert the admlnistrative process. If you are In agreement with this approach, we could have a staff report ready to introduce the concept to the City Council and receive authorization to
proceed as carly as the Council meeting scheduled for May 25, 2021.
Further, I would suggest that no new applications received going forward should be heard by the DAB. With that in mind, we would proceed immediately with an amendment once authorized to establish a new process as quickly as possible so as not to delay the project review process.

correspondence has prompted City staff to begin the appropriate process for elimination (please see the attached emails between Kerry Kusiak, Director of Planning and Community
Development and Greg Humora, City Manager). Furthermore, at my direction, new
development applications in the future will not be subject to DAB review.

believe this action should suffice to remedy any allegations of Brown Act violations that you
have asserted.

Also, because of the issues raised in your correspondence, if so requested by your Client, City staff would be happy to "redo" the March 8, 2021 DAB hearing on the development project planned at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California.

Please. contact me with any questions, concerns or requests. Thank you and have a pleasant a
vacation.

Glenn,

Sorry was unable to pick up the phone when you called today. I have some litigation and mediation deadlines to meet
this week, so likely will not be able to talk today or tomorrow.

I understand that the La Mesa City Council has not made a determination as to whether it will cure and/or correct the
deviations from the Brown Act specified in our April 7, 2021 correspondence - please correct me if some action has been taken, as I have received no notice of such action. My calendar shows that tomorrow, May 7, 2021, represents the last day upon which such a determination may be made, starting the 15-day clock for my client to file a petition for writ of mandate to seek the court's direction. As will be out of town when this deadline runs, I will be forced to file by April 21, 2021. I further understand from your voicemail, that you believe there may be some solution to this, or perhaps some other issues raised by St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California in its appeal of the Development Advisory Board's March 8, 2021 approval of the development proposal, and CEQA exemption thereto, at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, CA 91942.
My client welcomes workable resolutions to its claims, so I would ask that you get back to me by email with sufficient time to avoid litigation - there is, unfortunately, not much time to do so in light of the short deadlines imposed under
the Brown Act - so that can quickly pass your suggestions along.

Regards,
Felix

Checking in on the Citymark project review. Have they addressed the traffic comments to your
satisfaction and is the latest version of the traffic letter accepted? The plans and traffic study are in

All other departments are ready to accept the project as complete and have provided draft conditions of approval. As soon as get the go-ahead from you, I'H be compiling the draft conditions of approval together with a staff report and scheduling the project for DAB and DRB reviews.

Wanted to confirm the two remaining items:
1. Dedication of a clear space easement along the south side of Grossmont Blvd. Civil plans show
a "sight distance line" but there is no mention of an easement dedication. Can this be
covered in the conditions?
2. Provide a fee in lieu of $5K for construction of an ADA compliant curb ramp at the SE corner of
Grossmont Blvd. & Wilson St. Again, not shown on plans but could be addressed in

• Restripe Grossmont Blvd. in the vicinity of Wilson St. to improve location of limit line and
provide eastbound bike lanes and transitions to existing striping at either end.
The notes contained one other comment that is another possible condition of approval, if so
desired:
• Develop and implement an outreach program to minimize the number of two-plus vehicle families, inform and educate residents about the benefits of active transportation (biking and walking) and local transit opportunities to reduce the overall number of vehicle trips and
the demand for auto parking, particularly offsite. Include onsite parking in monthly unit
rental.
Conditions for a sight-distance easement and $5K contribution towards curb ramp at SE corner of
the intersection are already included in the draft COA. Confirmation on the language for the two
additional conditions bulleted above is all that is needed.

Leon,
I don't think the condition is supportable without their agreement. It would be better to officially ask them to do so to allay community concern, include it if they say yes and document their "no" if they go that way. There are CEQA implications otherwise. Glad to discuss further.

Based on a brief review of the latest submittal have a number of concerns on this project:
The TAL shows 0% traffic on Hayes St. My gut tells me as soon as Wilson/Grossmont backs up in the AM residents will take a right instead of a a of left out of the project and buzz down Hayes
to get to 1-8.
Somebody apparently waived the TAL requirement to model the adjacent intersections, so
there is no way to verify the impacts
• As a mixed-use project (and underparked in my opinion) it should be facilitating ped/bike use, but is providing almost nothing in the way of facilities. They are disputing the Grossmont crosswalk requirement and there is not even a curb ramp proposed to cross Wilson St. The on-street parking impacts and cut-through traffic are very sensitive issues with the community. What kind of leverage do we have to rectify this?

Good morning,

Pre-DAB is cancelled for today. However, in anticipation of holding DAB next Monday for Project No. 2020-16, a 49-unit mixed-used development at 5220 Wilson Street, I will be sending a first draft of conditions for your review later this morning. Please take few minutes to review them carefully for completeness. This project has generated a substantial amount of community interest, so we should expect interest in the meeting.

Leon,

DAB review has been postponed until March 8, so there is still time to revise the draft conditions if needed.

The applicant has not submitted a sewer report and there is currently no condition requesting one. A drainage study was provided: L:\CommDevAPlanning Project Submittals\2020-16\ Second Cycle Submittal\ 3246 Hydrology Study 2020

What is the difference in pre and post development for sewer EDU's? Is it significant enough to ask them to prepare

Another concern is the very limited parking that City Mark is offering to residents and retail in their location. Parking is very limited on the surrounding streets for residents already. We can not afford to have more cars overflow onto neighboring side streets to park and more importantly, increased traffic is a risk is to pedestrian safety. Marlen Way where I live is home to many children that play in the street due to lack of sidewalks. We already deal with speedy traffic on the daily attempting to cut through on Marlen Way to Grossmont Blvd. The "Not a Through Street" sign is angled poorly and has low visibility. Marlen Way residents have in the past made requests to the City of La Mesa for more signage for our dead end street. Unfortunately the requests have been addressed in a minimalist way that offered no improvement and ultimately did not help pedestrian and community safety.
Ideally the residents surrounding the City Mark Development would love to sec.... -Speed bumps on Hayes & Washington with "Slow" or "Watch for Children" signs to calm traffic and deter cars from cutting through -On Hayes from Jackson Dr. to Washington is a no parking zone. The no parking signs are frequently ignored. Fresh red paint on the asphalt of Hayes to accompany the signage and more signage to enforce no parking. This is a narrow street and dangerous to turn on and off Jackson & Hayes with illegally parked cars. Especially now since the overflow of Jersey Mikes and Hair Salon employees park on Hayes crowding the street. -Families of Marlen Way would like very clear and obvious "Not a Through Street" signage to deter the cut through traffic to Grossmont Blvd and discourage City Mark residents from parking on Marlen Way. -Residents of all neighboring streets, Marlen Way, Hayes, Washington, Barona & Wilson St. voiced a desire to learn more about "resident only parking" tags in the neighborhood to prevent City Mark cars from overflowing into the surrounding neighborhood streets to park. How can we learn more about this?
Our neighborhood is an odd collision of residential and commercial but we love it. We value our walkability and
we welcome growth and development. We are happy to see the corner of Wilson & Grossmont Blvd be developed to better suit the needs of our community. We however are very disappointed to see the City of La Mesa overlooking the needs and safety concerns of the current residents within the community. Our neighborhood will be directly impacted by the City Mark Development. We would like to see the City of La Mesa step up and do the right thing by their community. Thank you for your time in reviewing our concerns. I look forward to getting your input on the
matter at hand with City Mark Apartments.

(If you would like your comments directed to a specific individual, put the person's name in your message.): I am
a resident of Marlen Way (near Grossmont Blvd & Jackson). Recently my neighbors and myself attended a virtual mecting with the City Mark Apartments developers. As a neighborhood of Marlen Way, Washington, Hayes, Barona and Wilson St. we have concerns about traffic calming. We have been a part of numerous traffic calming studies. Hayes & Washington are known "cut throughs" between La Mcsa Blvd and Jackson Dr.. With the addition of so many residents in the City Mark building we would like to see the city step up and support traffic safety of our community. Help promote walkability in La Mesa. There are many families with children on these streets, There are no sidewalks and lot's of speedy traffic. It in was pointed out in our mceting that City Mark conducted their traffic study during covid which shows a falscly low rate of traffic, in the neighborhood during these times that people are working from home and not attending school at Warren Walker. We would like to request that City Mark reconduct the traffic study when traffic is normal post covid. Or simply work on the assumption that traffic is currently very low compared to normal times. One entrance/ exit driveway on Wilson St. is inadequate, flushing traffic from City Mark, down Wilson to Hayes/ Washington for west bound traffic leaving the apartments. Washington and Haycs also are a quick cut through when traveling from Jackson Dr., east to Wilson St.. This excess traffic through a residential neighborhood could be eased with another driveway at City Mark on the Grossmont Blvd. side of the parking lot.

Wanted to confirm the two remaining items:
1. Dedication of a clear space easement along the south side of Grossmont Blvd. Civil plans show a "sight distance line" but there is no mention of an easement dedication. Can this be
covered in the conditions?
2. Provide a fee in lieu of $5K for construction of an ADA compliant curb ramp at the SE corner of

provide eastbound bike lanes and transitions to existing striping at either end. The notes contained one other comment that is another possible condition of approval, if so
desired:
• Develop and implement an outreach program to minimize the number of two-plus vehicle
families, inform and educate residents about the benefits of active transportation (biking
and walking) and local transit opportunities to reduce the overall number of vehicle trips and
the demand for auto parking, particularly offsite. Include onsite parking in monthly unit

Leon,
don't think the condition is supportable without their agreement. It would be better to officially ask
them to do so to allay community concern, include it if they say yes and document their "no" if they
go that way. There are CEQA implications otherwise. Glad to discuss further.

Traffic Assessment Letter Requirements 2-10-06.pdf

1. The Traffic Assessment Letter (TAL) that was submitted for this project does not meet City
requirements, several components are missing including analyzing the Levels of Service for
adjacent intersections/roadways and the engineer's stamp & signature. Adjacent
intersections for this project shall include at a minimum Grossmont Blvd./Wilson St.,
Grossmont Blvd./La Mesa Blvd. and La Mesa Blvd./Wilson St. TAL requirements are attached. 2. Pending finalization of the TAL, I believe sufficient nexus exists for conditioning the following
improvements:
a. Posting of no parking and construction of a Class 2 eastbound bike lane along the project
frontage on Grossmont Blvd...
b. Construction of enhanced (Continental) crosswalks with appropriate lighting and warning devices on the west and south legs of the Grossmont Blvd. and Wilson St. intersection. The north end of the Grossmont Blvd. Crosswalk must land on a curb pop-out within the
existing right of way and in addition to the crosswalks the intersection must be restriped
for an eastbound left turn lane, one through lane, a right turn lane and a bike a lane.
c. Construction of ADA compliant sidewalks and curb ramps along the project frontage and
serving the crosswalks, as well as replacement of cracked or failed sections of the
existing curb and gutter.
d. Dedication of a pedestrian/utility easement along the frontage, minimum five foot wide
uniess precluded a by a pedestrian realm easement.
3. The plans are inconsistent on whether or not a driveway is proposed on Grossmont Blvd. Drawing C2.0 does not show a driveway symbol but drawing L2.1 shows a sight triangle at
this location. I don't believe a driveway is proposed at if this location but if one is additional
conditions will apply.

Subject: FW: Comments Requested: Planning Project No. 2020-16 (CityMark) Cycle 2 Review Phil,
Thanks for taking a few minutes to discuss the CityMark project. Neighbors are concerned about
traffic. In terms of additional analysis, we're thinking intersection analysis, a sight distance study,
pedestrian crossing, bike lane, and any other potential issues you can think of that could be raised as
community concerns. As the Bicycle Facilities Plan calls for a Class 2 bike lane along Grossmont Blvd,
we can and should ask for those improvements now, if needed. The project provides parking in
accordance with State law, so a parking study is not warranted.
Second cycle review was submitted on Friday a and a coordinated response from us would go a long
way towards ensuring a thorough response from the applicant, so I'm interested in hearing your
thoughts once you've had a chance to review.

Wanted to confirm the two remaining items:
1. Dedication of a clear space easement along the south side of Grossmont Blvd. Civil plans show a "sight distance line" but there is no mention of an easement dedication. Can this be
covered in the conditions?
2. Provide a fee in lieu of $5K for construction of an ADA compliant curb ramp at the SE corner of
Grossmont Blvd. & Wilson St. Again, not shown on plans but could be addressed in

Leon,
The Wilson Street project is scheduled for DAB on Monday, and a bike lane condition needs to be
added to the draft COA. I found the following in Phil's notes from our traffic meeting with the
applicant in December. Is this language sufficient for che condition:
• Restripe Grossmont Blvd. in the vicinity of Wilson St. to improve location of limit line and
provide eastbound bike lanes and transitions to existing striping at either end.
The notes contained one other comment that is another possible condition of approval, if so
desired:
• Develop and implement an outreach program to minimize the number of two-plus vehicle families, inform and educate residents about the benefits of active transportation (biking
and walking) and local transit opportunities to reduce the overall number of vehicle trips and
the demand for auto parking, particularly offsite. Include onsite parking in monthly unit
rental.
Conditions for a sight-distance easement and $5K contribution towards curb ramp at SE corner of
the intersection are already included in the draft COA. Confirmation on the language for the two additional conditions bulleted above is all that is needed. is

Thanks!

I added the following which put between the first and last paragraph:
Pedestrian facilities in the area are currently limited, CityMark is proposing only sidewalk along their frontage and a curb ramp at the SW corner of Wilson and Grossmont, with no ramp on the opposite side. The City is ultimately planning continuous sidewalk along the south side of Grossmont Blvd.; however, due to right of
way issues it will require the City's involvement to acquire the needed easements. Foot traffic from the project to retail areas directly to the north will be crossing Grossmont Blvd. at Wilson St. CityMark representatives expressed their concerns with building a "crosswalk to nowhere" as a condition of development. Leon stated he wasn't looking for improvements, but that the TAL lacked pedestrian analysis. That the project needed to take into account other modes of transportation and only vehicle and bicycle travel had been addressed. That the City Council would ultimately ask about and if not addressed the project would encounter issues. Leon commented that residents of the project would shop at Wal Mart and the project had addressed vehicle corner and stopping sights distances, but not for peds. Also, if
the project was proposing alternate modes of transportation how would residents get
to the bus stops at La Mesa Blvd and Grossmont Blvd?
The City has applied for a grant to complete bike lanes along Grossmont Blvd. CityMark has been requested to restripe the portion of roadway along their frontage for bike lanes on the south side only. John provided an overview of the proposed striping concept included with the TAL, which also moves the limit line north to
improve sight distance.
Can you add to your file and just send the link only?

Conclusion

The Council has an opportunity to correct the City's current course in misinterpreting the applicable law, and improperly failing to disclose the Project's scope and impacts. It need not solely rely upon the points raised by the community, the Church, or the subject matter experts who have opined on the Project but may do so simply by looking to the staff's own statements when they were not preparing reports or making oral presentations, but rather when they spoke openly with one another in their email correspondence. This correspondence, and those previously submitted to the City, convey a multitude of staff efforts to avoid compliance with the Brown Act, CEQA, and the SDB whether to purposefully benefit the Project applicant, or out of blatant misunderstanding and/or misinterpretation of the law. Whatever the cause, the Council need not walk any further along this flawed path and may avoid the ire of the community and the expense of further litigation if it simply opts to follow the law.
First, the Council should rescind the DAB's March 8, 2021 determination, as it should have when the Church first transmitted its April 7, 2021 demand for cure and correction. Second, the Council should direct the staff and the applicant to prepare all appropriate studies and a suitable a CEQA analysis (whether that is a negative declaration, mitigated negative declaration, or an environmental impact report) addressing all of the Project's potentially significant impacts, offer mitigation measures, where feasible, and acknowledge those impacts which are unmitigable so that the Council may eventually consider a statement of overriding considerations, if that is deemed appropriate. Third, the City should direct staff and its City Attorney to consider whether the waivers requested by the applicant may be granted in light of the specific, adverse impacts they constitute as proposed/approved. Fourth, the City should require that its staff answer directly to those statements they made in regarding to the Project's likely impacts so that the record on this point is clear and the issues need not be raised again by the public. Failing to do any of these things will merely perpetuate the deficiencies and tacitly uphold the unlawful acts which have already taken place, setting the Project, and the City, up for failure going forward.
Sincerely, inhy

State Density Bonus Violations

The Church has previously informed the City staff that its interpretation of the requirements for the grant of waivers under the SDB is flawed. Attached as Exhibit 13 is the July 21, 2021 comment letter transmitted by the undersigned to the Planning Commission. Gov. Code § 65915(e)(1) specifically provides that waivers of development standards under the SDB should not be granted when they would result in "specific, adverse impact... upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact." Notwithstanding this, the DAB, DRB, and City staff, have each acknowledged the Project's requested waivers from the City's development standards result in specific, adverse impacts upon health, safety, and the physical environment without offer of satisfactory mitigation. The City staff continue to be mistaken in their premise that the SDB require abdication of the agency's authority to impose basic health and safety requirements. Attached as Exhibit 14 is the March 8, 2021 comment letter transmitted by the undersigned to the DAB which provides a more substantial explanation of the issue.
The SDB requires that waivers be granted in one specific instance, and one instance only, wherein "an applicant may submit to a city, county, or city and county a proposal for the waiver or reduction of development standards that will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development...." (Gov. Code § 65915(e)(1).) Rather than make findings that the Project's requested waivers are necessary to avoid such physical preclusion of the development, the City relies upon claims that the institution of standard development regulations would result in increased cost to the applicant - the latter is only the basis for grant of incentives under the SDB, but not as to waivers. (Gov. Code § 65915(k)(3) [incentives require "identifiable and actual cost reductions to provide for affordable housing costs...."].) Common sense dictates that the SDB would not authorize any regulation which could result in specific, adverse harm to individuals or the physical environment, yet this is precisely what the City staff recommend.
The City staff have claimed that the Project may waive standard public realm improvements and parking space size and drive aisle standards resulting in hazardous traffic, pedestrian, and parking conditions. By way of example, parking area drive aisle sizes, which the Project seeks to reduce below the standards authorized under the law are likely to result in increased pedestrian and vehicular accidents in that reduced/tight spaces will make it more difficult to see and avoid hazards, obstructions, and people. Parking stalls sizes and drive aisles are specifically dimensioned to avoid such dangerous conditions and cannot reduced by SDB waiver yet this is precisely what the City staff has recommended by approved without reference to any statute or other legal precedent, largely because there is none.
The Council must direct the City staff, and the Project applicant, to revise the development's plans sufficiently to meet all health and safety requirements and not to rely improperly on inapposite waivers where none can be granted.

charitable works throughout the region. This nearly 120 year old organization has significantly affected local political and social issues from its current location for seven decades. Just a few examples of this include: (1) the creation of the Friends of The La Mesa Library organization which eventually helped build the first City library, (2) housing the City's first library within the LMWC clubhouse, (3) campaigning for the City's municipal incorporation, and (4) support for World War I efforts.

O The LMWC's clubhouse, constructed in the 1950s, was one of the last works, if not the last, of nationally recognized architect, Herluf Brydegaard, whose architecture has been deemed historic in the City of San Diego (the Feldman House) and is found throughout the region in institutional facilities reflecting his vision of Modern Contemporary architecture.
o Though the Project has prepared a historic analysis of the subject site, it is so obviously lacking in quality as to be without value in determining the property's significance. This is not the opinion of the undersigned, or of the lay community, but rather three (3) experts in this field - Bruce Coons, Executive Director of the Save Our Heritage Organisation, Todd Pitman, Landscape Architect, Planner, Historical Architecture expert, and City resident, and Kiley Wallace, President and Architectural Historian with Landmark Historic
Preservation. These individuals' expert opinions are attached as Exhibits 7-9,
respectively.
And, of particular note, is the fact that City staff, including Project Planner Allyson Kinnard, Community Development Director Kerry Kusiak, and City Manager Greg Humora, have each opined in communications obtained under the CPRA that the LMWC clubhouse
is likely historic given the above factors and that an environmental
impact report under CEQA may be required to approve its removal or replaccment These communications are attached as Exhibits 10-12,
respectively.

A categorical infill development exemption to CEQA cannot be granted to this Project in light of the site's historic nature and CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2(f). Rather than continuing to perpetrate a blatant attempt to avoid the obvious historic value of the LMWC clubhouse, as staff now recommend (in direct opposition to their prior, explicit stance), the Council must direct the preparation of a thoughtful, third party analysis of the historic criterion applicable to the site to ensure appropriate mitigation measures are developed to protect this invaluable resource.

affect the elderly opening their windows and sitting outside of their homes. The "unusual circumstances" exception, at Guidelines § 15300.2(c), to the infill development CEQA exemption claimed by the Project is at issue here in that most developments afforded the right to avoid review do not present such a clear danger to so many neighboring sensitive populations.
o The Project calls for the demolition of the 1950's-era LMWC building but has not analyzed whether the building materials commonly used prior to 1978, including asbestos, lead paint, and polychlorinated biphenyls may escape into the air and travel the less than 100 foot distance to the unsuspecting sensitive receptors and generate significant, long-term impairment to health. The failure to analyze whether such hazardous materials exist on site prior to bringing this Project forward for review, and what measures are to be taken to mitigate any such impacts, is a recipe for disaster as well as litigation from those who may be affected for decades to come. The presence of each of these hazardous materials may be readily determined by experts hired by the City (and paid for by the applicant) to afford protection to all involved. Further, doing so would avoid a claim under CEQA that the Project's unusual circumstances (that is, the age of the structure during a period in which these hazardous building materials were commonly employed), under CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2(c), result in an exception to the infill development exemption from review.
Recognition that these noise, air quality and hazardous materials issues require study does not implicate any detriment to the Project, but rather a means by which the City may comply with CEQA to determine whether potentially significant impacts may exist and the mitigation measures necessary to reduce those impacts to a level below significance. Such measures are not outrageous, nor out of the norm. For instance, Wood Environmental suggests "track-out grates or gravel beds at egress points, wheel-washing, soil binders, geotextiles, use of secured tarps or cargo covering, watering, treating of transported material" to minimize dust, street sweeping at the end of each day, daily watering of exposed soils, application of soil stabilizers, using tarps to cover stock piles, use of electronic rather than diesel machinery, muffling equipment, avoiding truck idling, using noise barriers/blankets, and working during hours which will least impact the neighboring sensitive receptors. This is especially so, in light of the potential harm to be caused if no analysis is performed for the Project's significant impacts in these categories. The Council should order that noise, air quality, and hazardous materials analyses be prepared, and mitigation measures proposed, before making any substantive determination on the merits of the Project.
(c) Historical Resources
o The LMWC is a historically significant organization predating the City's incorporation in 1912 by 10 years, having performed innumerable important

imposition of mitigation measures that may result from such an investigation, makes it impossible for decisionmakers such as the DRB,
the Commission, or the Council, let alone the public, to have an opportunity to review the true scope of the Project. (CEQA Guidelines § 15126.4(a)(1)(B); Sundstrom V. County of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296, 307.) Rather, such a traffic analysis must be performed
now and then brought back to the decisionmakers for review.

Given that the above-described cumulative traffic impacts and the site-specific dangerous roadway conditions (i.e., "unusual circumstances") have not been properly analyzed to date, Guidelines §§ 15300.2(b) and (c) require that no exemption from CEQA review may be afforded to the Project.

(b) Noise, Air Quality, & Hazardous Materials

O The Project proposes significant demolition, waste disposal, grading, and construction activities requiring heavy construction machinery and safety equipment for those onsite. Yet, this work is also occurring within 100 feet of the Church, Warren Walker School, and a senior living residential complex which support or house the disabled, children, and/or the elderly - all of which are sensitive receptors (that is, those individuals particularly sensitive to adverse impacts when exposed for extended periods of time) proximal to the Project's direct construction impacts arising from noise, air quality, and hazardous materials disposal.
o The Project will require significant and extensive work with heavy machinery during regular business hours coinciding with those times at which students are in attendance at Warren Walker School, congregants usc the Church, and seniors are likely to be in or around their homes neighboring the subject site. This work includes not only the demolition of the La Mesa Woman's Club ("LMWC") building, but also grading 88 percent of the nearly acre site
resulting in substantial earth movement (aka "cut and fill" activities). Noise (from demolition, construction, machinery, and vehicles) and air pollution (such as fugitive dust and fuel emissions from machinery and vehicles, and
other particulates) are inherent in such extensive work and must be considered to inform the public and decisionmakers as to the appropriate means to mitigate such impacts when generated so close to sensitive receptors. The noise, unless mitigated, will directly impact the Warren Walker School's students during their classroom hours, and may greatly harm those disabled individuals sensitive to loud sounds. The air quality will also impact the students both within their classrooms, and more so, when at play outdoors, as it will also

with lighting and warning devices on the west and south legs of Grossmont and Wilson intersection, (4) a curb pop-out, (5) restriping castbound left turn lane, one through lane, a right turn lane, and a bike a lane, (6) construction of ADA compliant sidewalks and curb ramps, and (7) dedication of a pedestrian easement along the frontage. See Exhibit 5 for a description of these mitigation measures the City staff originally
sought to impose.
Failure to evaluate geometric hazards raised by the curvature of Grossmont Boulevard, directly abutting the property, as it sharply turns towards the intersection at Wilson Street with no traffic calming, pedestrian, or bicycle safety measures (e.g., crosswalks, stop light, stop sign, ADA ramps, etc.). A proper analysis would examine cumulative impacts from all projected development in the area, the existing conditions, and the expected increases in pedestrian, bicycle, and vehicular traffic generated by the Project to determine how this already dangerous condition could be ameliorated by conditioning the development with improvements to mitigate this additional strain. Moreover, the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson
Street is well-known to the community as uniquely dangerous one (as voiced repeatedly by comments made to the DAB and the Commission by the general public as well a resident of La Mesa who also happens to be a planner working for the City of San Diego). The City itself is aware of the hazards in this area having determined that at least four major accidents here in the last decade, including two head-on collisions all without the
proposed increase in at least 49 new family units, guests, and retail customers coming to the Project. See Exhibit 6 for the City's Police Department Collision Report Summary.
The City's Design Review Board ("DRB"), at its March 8, 2021, voted to require the Project to prepare a complete traffic analysis in light the board members' concerns regarding the sight line and pedestrian realm improvements. Yet this condition is nowhere to be found in the Project's conditions prepared by staff though it was thoroughly discussed and approved by the DRB. We refer the Council to the DRB's recorded Zoom video which includes a lengthy discussion on the need for this traffic analysis. This failure to include the requirement required by the DRB in the Project's conditions must, of course, be corrected. Further, during the course of that March 8, 2021 DRB hearing, Mr.
Kusiak incorrectly informed the DRB board members that a traffic report could be prepared when the Project was at the "construction drawing" phase of development. But doing SO would result in a clear violation of CEQA, unlawfully deferring investigation and the

O Significant Effect. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances. [Guidelines § 15300.2(c).]

O Historical Resources. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource. [Guidelines § 15300.2(f).]
The Church has provided the City with a 10-page analysis from multidisciplinary subject- matter experts, Wood Environmental, explaining that the Project is likely to generate significant environmental impacts sufficient to meet the exceptions at CEQA Guidelines § § 15300.2(b) & (c). Attached as Exhibit 4 is a copy of the Wood Environmental analysis summarizing the Project's impacts. Rather than address this analysis and the underlying deficiencies of the Project's scope, the City ignores the facts, science, and law at hand.
The Project proposes to develop 49 residential units and 3 commercial spaces on a largely 3 underutilized site relying upon a "check-the-box" Initial Study with nothing more than wink and a nod at the scant analysis provided by the applicant. Wood Environmental and other subject matter experts have extensively described the discrepancies in the review of the applicant's materials and have suggested corrective actions for these serious deficicncies in the following regards:
(a) Traffic
• Improper reliance upon an analysis of average daily trips to determine levels of service rather than the legally mandated, and current state-of-the-art, requirement set forth by SB 743 (2013) known as a vehicle miles traveled ("VMT*) analysis to determine impacts and mitigation measures for the
development. (CEQA Guidelines § 15064.3 ["Generally, vehicle miles traveled is the most appropriate measure of transportation impacts."]; See also Governor's Office of Planning and Research Technical Advisory on Evaluating Transportation Impacts in CEQA at https://opr.ca.gov/docs/20190122- 743 Technical_Advisory.pdf.). A proper analysis would take into account the surrounding transportation, work, and shopping opportunities, as well as the cumulative impacts of neighboring uses to conclude the specific mitigation measures which would diminish the Project's specific impacts to a less than significant level.
Compounding matters, the City staff did, in fact, determine that the
traffic analysis offered to it was deficient and that "sufficient nexus exists" to condition the Project to make traffic improvements in light of the above-mentioned impacts, including (1) requiring no parking along Grossmont Boulevard, (2) construction of a Class 2 castbound bike lane along the property frontage, (3) construction of enhanced crosswalks

Had this action been taken before May 25, 2021, along with a reckoning of the entire set of Brown Act and LMMC violations alleged in the April 7, 2021, and corrective action taken to rescind the DAB's determinations, this appeal may not have been required. Instead, the City compounded its errors by moving the DAB's void March 8, 2021 decision forward to the Commission for review on appeal at its July 21, 2021 hearing. At that same hearing, the Commission was improperly instructed by City staff to avoid basing its determination on the Brown Act violations committed by the DAB, and as to other CEQA impacts raised by the Church and subject matter experts raised, further prejudicing the commissioners to resolve the outcome in
a manner aligning with the now-defunct DAB's approval of the Project. The City staff's efforts to screen vital information from decisionmakers runs counter to both CEQA and the Brown Act and has only resulted in in further violations of both. (County of Inyo v. City V. of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal. App. 3d 185, 192 [Decisionmakers and the public must be provided with accurate information about the nature and full scope of a development in order to make an informed conclusion.].) In short, the City staff informed the Commission that it should not make its determination on the Project based upon the historical aspects of the La Mesa Woman's Club, the DAB's Brown Act violations and the inherent prejudice exhibited by a determination which was pre-decided by City staff department heads outside of an open meeting, and all manner of other CEQA impacts raised by the Project instead, the staff improperly shaped the discussion by cherry-picking three issues to limit the Commission's scope of authority and the depth of its
review.

The Council has only one viable course before it now, to rescind the DAB's approvals at its March 8, 2021 meeting in light of the Brown Act violations its staff and City Attorney readily acknowledged but have repeatedly hidden from view. This Council should also direct that any further review of the Project be done in accord with not only the Brown Act, but with respect to the SDB, LMMC, and CEQA in light of the facts and law laid out below.
California Environmental Quality Act Violations
The Church has submitted extensive evidence of the Project's potentially substantial environmental impacts requiring review and prohibiting the grant of an exemption from CEQA analysis under CEQA Guidelines § 15332 for infill development. Though such a categorical a exemption from CEQA is ostensibly applicable to a development of the type at issue, Guidelines 15322 is subject to exceptions found at CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2 requiring environmental analysis of this Project. The pertinent exceptions are as follows:
o Cumulative Impact. All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type time is significant. [Guidelines § 15300.2(b).] in the same place, over

Such communications were confirmed when the Church received, through the California Public Records Act (Gov. Code § 6250 et seq.; "CPRA"), correspondence amongst the DAB board members indicating they had been regularly included on group emails asking for their analyses of the Project, and would often include one another (or use Project Planner Allyson Kinard as a go- between) to indicate the conditions they wished to place on the Project in order to secure their approval of same. Examples of several such communications amongst these DAB board members prior to the March 8, 2021 hearing are attached hereto as Exhibit 1 for the Council to better understand the issue. The Church has little doubt that discovery, in the context of the ongoing litigation, will result in more, and more egregious, instances of such meetings and discussions in
violation of the Brown Act.

On April 7, 2021, the Church delivered a demand for cure and correction, as required under Gov. Code § 54960.1, of this and other alleged Brown Act violations so that the Council could promptly determine what remedial actions should be taken within the statutorily prescribed 30-
day period thereafter. Rather than hold a meeting to address this issue, and after the 30-day period had. nearly passed, the City Attorney reached out to the undersigned, to attempt to correct the DAB's violations administratively - that is, without resort to bringing this matter to the Council's attention as the law requires - offering to "redo" the DAB hearing and suggesting that staff would ensure that the DAB would no longer hold any future hearings. Neither of these things came to pass. The City Attorney provided the undersigned with communications between Mr. Kusiak and City Manager Greg Humora indicating that they agreed the DAB was in violation of the Brown Act and should be dissolved. The undersigned informed the City Attorney that though the recognition of the Brown Act violation by City staff was a good start, the law requires the Council, and only the Council, may take timely, corrective action. Attached as Exhibit 2 are the referenced
communications between the City Attorney and the undersigned.
When the statutory 30-day period ran for corrective action, without Council action to acknowledge the alleged Brown Act violations (and the Church largely believes this was because the issue was not timely raised to the Council's attention), the Church was forced to file a petition for writ of mandate and complaint to have the Court unwind this matter. Attached as Exhibit 3 is the referenced petition and complaint.
On May 25, 2021, City staff recommend the Council dissolve the DAB offering little more
than a single sentence in the staff report indicating the basis for the dissolution of the DAB, as
follows:

Further, it has been brought to the attention of the City Council and staff (via correspondence dated April 7, 2021) that the regular interaction of DAB staff
outside public meetings may not be properly aligned with public meeting laws
(Brown Act).

Summary of Appeal
This firm, acting on behalf of the Church hereby timely appeals the Commission's July 21, 2021 approval of the Project and its exemption from review under CEQA. In making this appcal, the Church represents the interests of its congregation as well as the greater La Mesa community in order to ensure that the Project is properly reviewed to ascertain a true understanding of its impacts and the assignment of appropriate mitigation mcasures to ameliorate said impacts. As mentioned above, the Church, subject matter experts, and multitudes of community residents have protested the City's violations, to date, of the Brown Act, CEQA, and SDB. These deficiencies are fatal to the Project's approvals and should be remedied by the Council rather than waiting for a
court-ordered resolution.

Brown Act Violations

The Council recently dissolved the DAB and extensively revised the La Mesa Municipal Code ("LMMC") to remove the DAB's authority for land use approvals and CEQA determinations but was not made aware of why this course was recommended by staff. The impetus stems from the Church's protest of the DAB's determination with respect to the Project's Site Development Permit, and its request for exemption from CEQA, on March 8, 2021 due to the DAB's violations of the Brown Act. Though the City Attorney, Community Development Director and City Manager have all acknowledged the DAB violated the Brown Act, the staff failed to bring this to the Council's attention, and instead have attempted to keep this issue quiet. Rather than correct this unforced error in a timely fashion by the rescission of the DAB's approvals, the City's inattention to this matter has resulted in litigation brought by the Church to preserve its rights under the Brown Act and the LMMC.

During the March 8, 2021 hearing on the Project, the DAB was constituted of four City department heads, Director of Community Development, Mr. Kerry Kusiak who chaired the hearing, along with City Engineer Leon Firsht, Building Division Director Aaron Sturm, and Fire Marshal Steve Swaney. The Church informed the City staff that this was an untenable situation in that these individuals oversee such development applications and regularly communicate with one another in devising conditions of approval and their respective recommendations for authorization as to CEQA and City development standards. Such communications between decisionmakers outside of the confines of an open meetings are strictly forbidden under the Brown Act, whether carried out directly or through serial meetings/discussions using go-betweens such as their respective staff-members. (Gov. Code § 54952.2(b)(1) [prohibiting decisionmakers from using "a series of communications of any kind, directly or through intermediaries, to discuss, deliberate, or take action" on business within its subject matter jurisdiction outside of an open meeting.].) That this activity was ongoing was a foregone conclusion in that it is highly unusual, if not outright unique, to have a decision-making legislative body, as that term is used in the Brown Act, like the DAB be constituted of agency staff, let alone department heads who regularly meet and discuss aspects of each development before the City.

Re: Appeal of July 21, 2021 Planning Commission Determination (Project No. 2020-16)

Dear Ms. Wiegelman:

This correspondence shall serve as a request to appeal the determination of the July 21, 2021 City of La Mesa ("City") Planning Commission ("Commission") to: (a) approve the CityMark Communities LLC ("Applicant") devclopment project at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California, also known as Project No. 2020-16 (the "Project'), (b) approve the Project's exemption from the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), and (c) reject the appeal of the Development Advisory Board ("DAB") determination of March 8, 2021 filed by St. Luke's Lutheran Church ("Church"). The Commission's determination was tainted in several respects including: (a) improper reliance on the DAB's determination, which was void and without effect due to that legislative body's violations of the Ralph M. Brown Act (Gov. Code § 54950 et seq.; "Brown Act"), resulting in ongoing litigation with the City and the dissolution of the DAB by the City Council ("Council"), (b) the improper narrowing of the issues on appeal raised by the Church to the Commission, (c) the extensive record of the Project's impacts under CEQA with respect to traffic, construction-related air quality, noise, and hazardous materials disposal impacts to sensitive receptors, and historical resources, and (d) the improper grant of waivers under the State Density Bonus law (Gov. Code § 65915 et seq.; "SDB".) in light of the Project's specific and adverse impacts upon health, safety and/or the physical environment without investigation of satisfactory mitigation. Each of these issues has been raised previously by the Church, subject matter experts, and the community-at-large, but the City continues to sweep these issues under the
rug. This must now be corrected by the Council.
The Council is requested to hear this appeal as to all issues relating to the Project that have been previously raised to the City, and which may be raised at or before a hearing on this matter.

Automobile sales are allowed in the C zone with approval of a site development plan.
Automobile storage of new vehicles is allowed in the C zone for a limited duration of 18
months with approval of a conditional use permit. The property is currently zoned RB-D-MU.
While the base RB zone does not allow these uses, the MU overlay does allow a car sales use
on the property with approval of a conditional use permit in a mixed-use development, but
does not allow car storage.
Sales: Car sales could be allowed in a mixed-use development with approval of a conditional
use permit. It would also be possible to change the zoning to C, in which case auto sales is
allowed with approval of a site development plan - this would be the best path if they do
not want mixed-use.
Storage: For vehicle storage of no longer than 18 months duration, the zoning would need to
be changed to C and a conditional use permit approved. This would be a more difficult path
and would only provide a short time frame for auto storage.

Residential is permitted on the ground-floor level with development standards as described in this overlay zone.

2.
A conditional use permit shall be required for the following uses:

Pedestrian Orientation Along Street Frontage and Setbacks. A minimum twelve-foot wide pedestrian realm is required in front of all mixed-use, residential, 1. or commercial projects located along Circulation Element designated streets. The pedestrian realm shall be measured from the face of the curb.

Employee parking could be accommodated on this lot with a CUP and pedestrian realm. Building

Kerry,
The La Mesa Women's Club site is zoned RB, which does allow, by
CUP, parking as an accessory use to adjacent/across the street
commercial uses. With a üse permit, the project would be subject to CEQA. Although additional research is needed, it does appear likely
that there would be cultural resource impacts. This could prove
problematic as demolition is generally not mitigable under CEQA.
According to Images of America: La Mesa (Newland, 2010), the La
Mesa Women's is Club is the oldest community civic organization in La
Mesa, formed in 1902. The building has served as the group's
headquarters since 1959. The architect, Herluf Brydegaard, designed
a number of notable midcentury civic and commercial buildings,
some in collaboration with Lloyd Ruocco. The Women's Club building
maintains its original integrity and would likely be eligible as a
historic landmark under multiple criteria.

Roger,
Ijust left you a voicemail, but I thought I would email this information to you.
The lot is zoned RB-D-MU (residential business-urban design overlay-mixed use overlay)
You had expressed interest in purchasing the parcel and using it for employee parking.
In reviewing the municipal code for zoning:
(RB Zoning) Section 24.05.020 C.1.
Accessory parking to an adjacent business may be permitted if the business is either adjacent to or
on the opposite side of the street with a Conditional Use Permit. Therefore, you could use this parcel as an employee parking lot if you obtained a Conditional Use
Permit.
Conditional Use Permits are approved by the planning commission. Properties within 300 feet of the
proposed use would be notified during the process.
(MU Overlay) Section 24.18.030 Requires a Conditional Use Permit for parking lots within the mixed use overlay zone. Also, the mixed use overlay zone requires a 12-foot pedestrian realm (sidewalk and landscaping setback) along the street frontage of the property. The pedestrian zone may have to be constructed. The same Conditional Use Permit above would be used to satisfy this requirement.
Parking (24.04.040) If this parking lot will be used to satisfy the "required" parking for your employees then there needs
to be a traversable pedestrian route within 300 feet.
I am not sure that this parking lot is "required" at this point. The building at 5220 Wilson Street appears to be 50 years old and may have historical significance. It has been the home of the La Mesa Women's Club and may have been designed by a notable architect. Therefore, you will likely need to conduct a cultural resources study and potentially an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the building if you intend to demolish it. If you intent to demo the building you may have to demonstrate that there are environmental "overriding considerations"
that require the building to be demolished. Please email or call with questions. Thank you.
I hope the rain holds off on Sunday!

Checking in on the Citymark project review. Have they addressed the traffic comments to your
satisfaction and is the latest version of the traffic letter accepted? The plans and traffic study are in

All other departments are ready to accept the project as complete and have provided draft

Wanted to confirm the two remaining items:
1. Dedication of clear space easement along the south side of Grossmont Blvd. Civil plans show a "sight distance line" but there is no mention of an easement dedication. Can this be
covered in the conditions?
2. Provide a fee in lieu of $5K for construction of an ADA compliant curb ramp at the SE corner of
Grossmont Blvd. & Wilson St. Again, not shown on plans but could be addressed in

• Restripe Grossmont Blvd. in the vicinity of Wilson St. to improve location of limit line and
provide eastbound bike lanes and transitions to existing striping at either end.
The notes contained one other comment that is another possible condition of approval, if so
desired:
• Develop and implement an outreach program to minimize the number of two-plus vehicle
families, inform and educate residents about the benefits of active transportation (biking
and walking) and local transit opportunities to reduce the overall number of vehicle trips and
the demand for auto parking, particularly offsite. Include onsite parking in monthly unit
rental.
Conditions for a sight-distance easement and $5K contribution towards curb ramp at SE corner of
the intersection are already included in the draft COA. Confirmation on the language for the two
additional conditions bulleted above is all that is needed.

Leon,
I don't think the condition is supportable without their agreement. It would be better to officially ask them to do SO to allay community concern, include it if they say yes and document their "no" if they
go that way. There are CEQA implications otherwise. Glad to discuss further.

members of the DAB is an integral part of the development review process. The DAB members, or their supervised staff, collaborate and coordinate on the review of development projects regularly to ensure project compliance with codified requirements and to ensure consistency between departments in the review process. Each DAB member is charged with review of projects relative to the requirements within their discipline of work, and with crafting appropriate conditions of approval for projects.
The DAB considers projects for approval in regular, public meetings held on the second and fourth Mondays of each month. The agendas for these meetings are posted not less than 72 hours prior to the meeting time in compliance with the Brown Act. Final determinations on projects can be delayed by several weeks after they are ready to proceed while they wait for a scheduled meeting date to occur.
Staff has been considering and evaluating the DAB and the DAB process to discover if there is a more effective and efficient manner to conduct the business currently undertaken by the DAB.

DISCUSSION:

The DAB process could be achieved in a more streamlined fashion while maintaining the integrity and transparency of the process. Staff suggests the functions that the DAB performs be delegated to the staff members that make up the DAB, but in an administrative process that is coordinated under the Director of Community Development. Currently, each of the DAB members is primarily concerned with the project's compliance with requirements within their discipline. This is in contrast to a typical board or commission, where members consider the whole of a project and whether it complies with all of the applicable requirements related to all disciplines. With an administrative process, each department would continue to review projects in relation to their areas of responsibility and expertise, and develop appropriate conditions of approval.
The Director of Community Development would gather the project reviews and conditions of approval from each of the reviewing departments in a notice of decision that provides a report on the project and its compliance with applicable requirements, and serves as an approval document that includes conditions of approval. The draft notices of decision would be posted for five calendar days in the same manner and places that DAB agendas are currently posted to allow the public time to comment on the project. Any comments received would be considered prior to making the determination proposed in the draft notice of decision. Final approvals of the Director of Community Development would be subject to appeal to the Planning Commission, and then the City Council, similar to the current DAB appeal process.
The elimination of the DAB meeting would allow projects to proceed to the approval process when ready. Applicants would not have to wait for a regularly scheduled meeting to occur. The posting of draft notices of decision would continue to provide an opportunity for the public to comment on projects prior to approval, and comments received would be treated in the same fashion as they are with the current DAB process. Further, it has been brought to the attention of the City Council and staff (via correspondence dated April 7, 2021) that the regular interaction of DAB staff outside public meetings may not be properly aligned with public meeting laws (Brown Act). The elimination of the DAB would obviate any such concerns.

numerous discussions have transpired among City staff over the years regarding the elimination of the Development Advisory Board (DAB) for various reasons. Your correspondence has prompted City staff to begin the appropriate process for elimination (please see the attached emails between Kerry Kusiak, Director of Planning and Community Development and Greg Humora, City Manager). Furthermore, at my direction, new development applications in the
future will not be subject to DAB review. I believe, this action should suffice to remedy any allegations of Brown Act violations that you
have asserted.

Also, because of the Issues raised in your correspondence, if so requested by your Client, City staff would be happy to "redo" the March 8, 2021 DAB hearing on the development project planned at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California.
Please contact me with any questions, concerns or requests. Thank you and have a pleasant

Re: May 11, 2021 Correspondence-Brown Act Demand for Cure and Correction Regarding
Development Advisory Board

Dear Mr. Tinkov:

This correspondence addresses your correspondence referenced above. Perhaps further information will alay your Client's concerns regarding Brown Act Violations by the Development Advisory Board (DAB). First, a draft ordinance eliminating the DAB is scheduled for
consideration by the La Mesa City Council on May 25, 2021 (agenda available on May 21, 2021) ("Ordinance"). Staff and the City Attorney's office will be recommending adoption. In La Mesa, the Mayor and the City Manager set the Council agenda. My strong anticipation is that the Ordinance will be adopted. In that event, obviously, the City will seek to dismiss any Brown Act lawsuit filed regarding the DAB and refuse any request related for Attorneys' fees.
Furthermore, as I mentioned in my earlier correspondence, at the City Attorney's directive, no new development applications will be considered by the DAB pending the final outcome related
to the Ordinance.

Thank you for your consideration and I hope this information has been helpful.

Glenn,

Sorry I was unable to pick up the phone when you called today. I have some litigation and mediation deadlines to meet
this week, so likely will not be able to talk today or tomorrow.

I understand that the La Mesa City Council has not made a determination as to whether it will cure and/or correct the deviations from the Brown Act specified in our April 7, 2021 correspondence - please correct me if some action has been taken, as I have received no notice of such action. My calendar shows that tomorrow, May 7, 2021, represents the last day upon which such a determination may be made, starting the 15-day clock for my client to file petition for writ of mandate to seek the court's direction. As will be out of town when this deadline runs, I will be forced to file by April
21, 2021. I further understand from your voicemail, that you believe there may be some solution to this, or perhaps some other issues raised by St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California in its appeal of the Development Advisory Board's March 8, 2021 approval of the development proposal, and CEQA exemption thereto, at 5220 Wilson Street, La
Mesa, CA 91942.

My client welcomes workable resolutions to its claims, so I would ask that you get back to me by email with sufficient time to avoid litigation - there is, unfortunately, not much time to do so in light of the short deadlines imposed under the Brown Act - so that I can quickly pass your suggestions along.

Regards,

Subject: RE: St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California

Good afternoon Glenn,

hope this message finds you well.
First, must note an error in my message of May 6, 2021 below - I had mistakenly indicated that I would be required to a file a petition by Aprit 21, 2021 which, of course, would be impossible. I had intended to say that because of previously planned travel, I would have to file by May 21, 2021.
With that out of the way, have reviewed your letter and while I appreciate what appears to be an earnest desire on the part of Mr. Humora and Mr. Kusiak to eliminate the Development Advisory Board, this response to St. Luke's April 7, 2021 Brown Act Demand for Cure and Correction is legally deficient. The Brown Act requires that the legislative body (i.e., the City Council) review the asserted violations in such a demand and to take action. (See, for instance, Government Code Section 54960.1(c)(2) ["Within 30 days of receipt of the demand, the legislative body shall cure or
correct the challenged action and inform the demanding party in writing of its actions to cure or correct or inform the demanding party in writing of its decision not to cure or correct the challenged action."].)
Though Mr. Humora is the City Manager, and Mr. Kusiak is the Director of Planning and Community Development, i am not aware of any statutory or caselaw which would indicate they have the authority to respond to a demand of this nature in compliance with the Act. Of course, if you have some legal basis to believe otherwise, | look forward to reviewing the material. Failing this, and in light of what I understand to be inaction on the part of the City Council with respect to my client's allegations of improprieties under the Brown Act, St. Luke's is forced to proceed as indicated previously (and corrected above).

Sincerely,
Felix Tinkov

Kerry,

Thank you for your email.
After discussions with the City Attorney, we both agree that your suggestions regarding the DAB should be implemented. Therefore, in conjunction with the City Attorney's office (after consultation with the Mayor), I will be placing this matter on the Council agenda for Its consideration as soon as possible, but no later than 30 days from today. Furthermore, at the direction of the City Attorney, as of today, no further new applications will be processed through the DAB. This action remedies any allegations of Brown Act violations regarding the DAB.

Subject: Development Advisory Board

Greg, As we have discussed, the appellant's attorney in the Wilson Street project (2020-16) has also challenged the valldity of the makeup of the Development Advlsory Board (DAB) under the Brown Act. The challenge centers on the contention that the staff that make up the DAB (Directar of Community Development, Director af Public Works, Building Official, and Fire Marshall) have serial meetings in violation of the Act. The attorney notes that the staff on the board necessarily interact outside of public meetings to perform the function of project review.
In this regard, think the attorney may be on point. To remedy this situation, I suggest that the DAB be eliminated as soon as possible and replaced with an administrative review process under the authority of the Community Development Director. The process could include some level of public review period of projects prior to a decision being made, with the possIbility of appeal. Since the DAB was established by ordinance, an ordinance would be needed to amend the Zoning Code to remove the DAB and Insert the administrative process. If you are In agreement with this approach, we could have a staff report ready to introduce the concept to the City Council and receive authorization to proceed as carly as the Council meeting scheduled for May 25, 2021.
Further, would suggest that no new applications received going forward should be heard by the DAB. With that in mind, we would proceed immediately with an amendment once authorized to establish a new process as qulckly as possible so as not to delay the project revlew process.

Re: April 7, 2021 Correspondence-Brown Act Demand for Cure and Correction Regarding
Development Advisory Board

Dear Mr. Tinkov:

This correspondence addresses your correspondence as referenced above. Please noté that numerous discussions have transpired among City staff over the years regarding the elimination of the Development Advisory Board (DAB) for various reasons. Your
correspondence has prompted City staff to begin the appropriate process for eliminatian (please see the attached emalls between Kerry Kusiak, Director of Planning and Community
Development and Greg Humora, City Manager). Furthermore, at my direction, new
development applications in the future will not be subject to DAB review.

believe this action should suffice to remedy any allegations of Brown Act violations that you
have asserted.

Also, because of the issues ralsed in your correspondence, if so requested by your Client, City staff would be happy to "redo" the March 8, 2021 DAB hearing on the development project planned at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California.

Please contact me with any questions, concerns or requests. Thank you and have a pleasant
vacation.

Glenn,

Sorry I was unable to pick up the phone when you called today. I have some litigation and mediation deadlines to meet
this week, so likely will not be able to talk today or tomorrow.
I understand that the La Mesa City Council has not made a determination as to whether it will cure and/or correct the deviations from the Brown Act specified in our April 7, 2021 correspondence - please correct me if some action has been taken, as I have received no notice of such action. My calendar shows that tomorrow, May 7, 2021, represents the last day upon which such a determination may be made, starting the 15-day clock for my client to file a petition for writ of mandate to seek the court's direction. As will be out of town when this deadline runs, I will be forced to file by April 21, 2021. I further understand from your voicemail, that you believe there may be some solution to this, or perhaps some other issues raised by St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California in its appeal of the Development Advisory Board's March 8, 2021 approval of the development proposal, and CEQA exemption thereto, at 5220 Wilson Street, La
Mesa, CA 91942.
My client welcomes workable resolutions to its claims, so I would ask that you get back to me by email with sufficient time to avoid litigation - there is, unfortunately, not much time to do so in light of the short deadlines imposed under the Brown Act - so that I can quickly pass your suggestions along.

Regards,

development plan approval by the vo. DAB]; LMMC § 2.66.110 [requiring the DAB to meet with
respect to certain development projects pursuant to Ordinance 2457, July 14, 1987]; and LMMC § 24.02.037 (Ord. 97-2686 § 2 formulated November 25, 1997); LMMC § 22.04.010 (Ord. 2315
formulated May 26, 1983); LMMC § 18.18.060 (Ord. 2358 formulated June 21, 1984); LMMC § 22.03.010 (Ord. 2006-2774 § 1 formulated November 28, 2006); and LMMC § 22.02.010 (Ord. 2307; March 24, 1983.) In short, there is little question that the DAB is subject to the Brown Act.
A meeting is defined by the Brown Act as "any congregation by majority" of the legislative body at the same time and place to "hear, discuss, or deliberate" on any matter within the jurisdiction of the body. The Brown Act, Open Meetings For Local Legislative Bodies, Office of the Attorney General, 2003, at p. 8. Because all of the DAB board members congregated together, albeit by remote video conference, to hear, discuss and deliberate on the Project's site
development plan and CEQA exemption, the requirement for a public meeting under the Brown Act is met. In light of these facts, the DAB's March 8, 2021 hearing on the Project was, and is, a public hearing subject to all of the requirements of the Brown Act, contrary to Mr. Kusiak's
assertions.

We strongly recommend the City Council direct the City Attorney, or other legal counsel, properly train the DAB board members, and the City staff more generally, on the requirements of the Brown Act to avoid such confusion and any further violations in the future.

CONCLUSION

Given the above points, SLLC demands the City Council:

(1) Acknowledge the violations described above and make a commitment not to act in a similar manner in the future;
(2) Afford the public a reasonable opportunity to communicate with the DAB prior to, and during, all future public hearings of the board; (3) Revise the constituents of the DAB board to comport with the Brown Act; (4) Revise the LMMC with respect to the DAB board to comport with the Brown Act; and (5) Rescind any and all actions taken during the March 8, 2021 DAB hearing on the Project pending further rehearing by the reconstituted DAB.

The City Council must notify this office of its decision to cure and correct as demanded no later than 5 p.m. on Friday, May 7, 2021.
Should the City Council fail, or refuse to perform as demanded, this will serve as evidence of an actual and present disagreement over the public's rights and the City's responsibilities under the Brown Act and may lead my client to consider legal action as authorized by the Brown Act. It

PWM255

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Honorable Mayor Arapostathis and City Council April 7, 2021
Page 3 of 5

In light of the egregious nature of the City's handling of the public comment portion of the hearing, which can only be considered arbitrary, capricious, restrictive, and unreasonable in light of the opportunities afforded to the Project applicant, we strongly recommend the City Council correct this violation of the Brown Act by ordering new DAB hearing affording the public a right
to be heard.

3. The Brown Act prohibits serial meetings - that is, a majority of the decision making members may not "use a series of communications of any kind, directly or through intermediaries, to discuss, deliberate, or take action on any item of business outside of the public meeting. Government Code § 54952.2(b). Yet, this is precisely what happened (and likely happens with respect to all DAB matters) in that each of the board members of that body are City staff members (Community Development Director Kerry Kusiak, City Engineer Leon Firsht, Building Division Director Aaron Sturm, and Fire Marshal Steve Swaney), all of whom by necessity of their respective positions specifically interacted with one another, either serially or in groups, to determine what impacts, requirements, conditions, and features the Project has, or should have.
Such discussions of the Project, and the DAB's ultimate outcome, run afoul of the Brown Act and cannot conceivably be corrected without the replacement of each of the board members with individuals other than City staff members. We suggest the City Council disband the DAB and appoint new board members whose positions do not require that they review, discuss, and otherwise weigh in on development projects which go before the DAB to avoid such conflicts going forward. We further suggest that in light of these circumstances, the DAB's approval of the Project, and its prospective CEQA exemption, be rescinded until such time as a new DAB board
is empaneled.
Further, we note what appears to be a misconception on the part of the DAB chair, Mr.
Kusiak. Throughout the DAB meeting, Mr. Kusiak claimed that this was "not a public hearing" but was instead a "posted board meeting" which "did not require public noticing." This is incorrect.
Government Code section 54952(b) provides that the provisions of the Brown Act cover
"legislative bodies" which include each:
..commission, committee, board, or other body of a local agency, whether permanent or
temporary, decision making or advisory, created by charter, ordinance, resolution, or formal action of a legislative body....
The DAB a is such a "legislative body" for the purposes of the Brown Act in that it is a permanent board, created by the City through by ordinance and/or formal action. See, for instance, La Mesa Municipal Code ("LMMC") § 24.02.010 [specifying the responsibility of the DAB to review development proposals and specifically indicating it is subordinate to the City Council pursuant to Ord. 2600 8§ 2-6 formulated April 28, 1992); LMMC § 24.02.035 [requiring site

legislative body's consideration of the item, that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the legislative body…..
(Emphasis added.)

On December 17, 2020, this firm specifically requested to be notified of all Project and CEQA-related hearings. The City, through its City Clerk, acknowledged receipt of the request on December 28, 2020. (Exhibit "A".) Notwithstanding this, we never received notice of the March 8, 2021 DAB hearing from the City. Rather, our client fortuitously notified us of the DAB hearing on March 5, 2021 at approximately 11:15 am. Making matters worse, the DAB staff report indicated that any audio/visual presentation to be made by the public would need to be submitted by 12:00 pm on that same day - March 5, 2021. (Exhibit "B".)
As it is impossible to put together such a presentation, and it to submit it to the City, in the span of 45 minutes, SLLC was not able to present its position, in full, during the course of the DAB's consideration of the Project. This is violative of Government Code section 54954.3(a) in that the City failed to afford this firm, and the public generally, an opportunity to directly address the DAB as required.
We strongly suggest the City Council correct this by ordering the DAB hold a new hearing on the Project and that the public be afforded proper notice of this new hearing.

2. The Brown Act does not permit the City to limit public participation in a manner that is "too arbitrary and capricious, too restrictive and unreasonable." Nevens v. Chino (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 775, 778; see also Robins V. Pruneyard Shopping Center (1979) 23 Cal.3d 899, 907 [The right of the people to petition the government for redress of grievances is "yital to a basic process in the state's constitutional scheme."]; Cal. Const., Art. I, § 3(a), (b)(1), and (b)(7).
Yet, this is precisely what the City did in foisting a 150-page DAB staff report, without notice, on the public. It followed this violative action by then restricting the public's ability to participate in the March 8, 2021 hearing - the staff report indicated that public comments had to be delivered solely via email by 8:00 am on March 8, 2021, so that only the first 300 words of any such comment would be placed into the record before the DAB. Of the public comments that were read, the majority indicated they had insufficient time to review the staff report, and/or that they were elderly and without access to email (requiring the assistance of family members', with limited time and resources of their own, to register their position with respect to the Project). This, notwithstanding the fact, that each of the DAB board members, the City staff, and Project applicant spoke freely, and without limitation in fact, the DAB chair continued the Project's hearing repeatedly to permit one of the applicant's consultants an opportunity to appear resulting in the closure of the hearing almost two hours after it started. Yet, not a single member of the public was permitted to speak, or to present anything more than 300 words.

Subject: Brown Act Demand for Cure and Correction Regarding Development Advisory Board

Honorable Mayor Arapostathis and City Council:
This demand is made on behalf of this firm's client, St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California ("SLLC"). All further communications regarding this matter should be directed to this
office.

On March 8, 2021 at 10 am (PST), the City of La Mesa ("City") Development Advisory Board ("DAB") held a public hearing with respect to the prospective development of the La Mesa Woman's Club property at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California 91942 (the "Project"), and its claimed exemption from the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Leading up to, and during the course of, that DAB hearing the City ran afoul of the Ralph M. Brown Act (Government Code sections 54950 et seq.; the "Brown Act") which requires the public be afforded various rights to be heard, and to hear, about matters of public concern such as the Project. These rights were violated, and this situation must be rectified by the City Council.
We present this correspondence in the hopes that the City Council will take this opportunity to cure or otherwise correct these Brown Act violations so that no further action need be taken by
the SLLC to resolve these issues.

Violations of the Brown Act

1. The Brown Act, at Government Code section 54954.3(a), requires public agencies
provide:

Hollywoodland Specific Plan v City of Los Angeles (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1187; McQueen v Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1148; Lewis v Seventeenth District Agricultural Association (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 823, 211.)
In light of these facts, the City cannot use a categorical exemption to avoid further analysis of the Project and must proceed to prepare an initial study followed by the preparation of a mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report permitting the public and the City's decisionmakers a thoughtful and reasoned opportunity to examine the totality of the Project
and its potential impacts.

III. Conclusion

The City has failed to provide the public with a substantive opportunity to participate in a public forum regarding this Project in light of the inadequate (and with respect to the DAB, non- existent) notice, along with the practical impossibility of petitioning the government with a fulsome expression of the public's interests and grievances with regard to the development. The sharply limited deadlines needlessly imposed on the public do not comport with the law.
Further, the Project does not comply with the City's General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, the State Density Bonus Law, nor CEQA. In all, this Project must be sent back for significant further
revisions and review.

We further note that the church is now engaged in a quiet title action with the LMWC,'
before the superior court, over the church's driveway to resolve the ownership, possession, and control of this area. Should the court determine that the church is the title owner of the land, the Project's total size will be sharply reduced resulting in a significant reduction in its base density, as well as any density bonus which may be afforded to it under the current proposal. Moreover, the Project seeks to install a tall retaining wall along this driveway, which will not be permissible upon the church securing explicit title in this land. And, the Project plans show that the church's driveway is being improperly shown as a fire truck access road during times of emergency though it does not offer access to the Project site given the steep slope separating the properties. In light of this, we strongly recommend the City hold back any decision which may result in confusing these issues or bringing the City into the action unnecessarily.

We note the DRB and DAB Staff Reports both inaccurately claim that the Project site at 5220 Wilson Street is owned by CityMark. It is, in fact, owned solely by the LMWC according to the church's latest information.

throughout the site's development both before (during demolition) and long past (during construction) the grading operations. The noise from all of this construction will flow unimpeded into the directly adjacent school and playground disrupting hundreds of children's' education for what is likely to be a period of one to two years. (3) Hazardous materials disposal during construction. The LMWC building was constructed prior to the elimination of asbestos-containing materials, lead-based paints, and polychlorinated biphenyls, yet no analysis has been made of these hazards (or methods to mitigate these potential hazards) upon adjacent residents, churchgoers, senior living facility residents, and/or schoolchildren. (4) Hydrology and water quality impacts from the developed Project. The church's experts have analyzed the existing site, and the proposed Project at build-out, and determined that the Project's drainage study inaccurately describes the conditions such that considerably more stormwater is expected to flow onto the church property than reported.
(5) Transportation impacts from construction and the developed Project. These impacts include significant numbers of heavy-haul trucks going through Wilson Street (designated a local collector) interrupting regular traffic and parking along the road, as well as church and school pick-ups and drop-offs, and a failure to follow the current standard in traffic analysis under CEQA, namely a vehicle miles traveled (VMT) analysis pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15064.3. And as indicated above, the
analysis indicates the dangers inherent in the intersection at Grossmont Boulevard and
Wilson Street.

But for the Project's hydrology and water quality analyses, the church's expert analyses on the remaining impact categories described above remain the only information in the administrative record such that the City cannot simply overlook the described potentially significant impacts. Neither the Project applicant, nor the City itself, have made any attempt to respond to these expert analyses such that CEQA requires that an initial study be prepared. (Hansen Brothers Enterprises, Inc. v. Board of Supervisors (1996) 12 Cal.4th 533, 560 [standing for the proposition that undisputed evidence in the administrative record must be relied upon.].) Until such time as the Project applicant, or the City, rebut the evidence presented by the church's experts, and with respect to certain issues, the testimony, and opinions of laypersons, those remain the only materials upon which the City may rely in determining whether the exemption to CEQA under Guidelines section 15332 may be effective.
Under CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c), "[a] categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." Such an exception to CEQA Guidelines section 15332 exists in the administrative record in light of church's undisputed expert testimony as to impact categories described above. The City may not ignore evidence of an unusual circumstance creating a reasonable possibility of a significant environmental impact. (Committee to Save the

A. The City May Not Apply The In-Fill Development Exemption In Light Of The Project's Expected, and Known, Potentially Significant Impacts
The City proposes to avoid CEQA review of the Project by employing the In-Fill Development exemption found at CEQA Guidelines section 15332. This exemption provides that in-fill development may avoid CEQA analysis if:
(a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and
regulations. (b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses. (c) The project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened
species. (d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality. (e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.
Our client has secured all Project materials the City purports to have in its possession or control via the California Public Records Act ("CPRA"). In securing this data, it has become readily obvious that very little analysis of the Project's potentially significant impacts to the environment have been performed to date. In fact, the only data in the administrative record analyzing the Project under CEQA has been provided by our client's environmental experts. These analyses, and the records produced pursuant to the above-mentioned CPRA request, indicate that though CityMark submitted an "Environmental Assessment/Initial Study Application" the City has performed no analysis of its own and has no Initial Study to indicate whether further environmental review must occur. Moreover, the expert analyses provided by our client, concretely and definitively specifies potentially significant impacts in the following CEQA
categories:
(1) Air quality impacts arising from construction. This is especially important in that the Project proposes significant grading - "400 cubic yards of excavation (cut) and 1,400 cubic yards of fill... primarily used to raise the rear of the site to establish a pad for the parking area [along with].... [a] retaining wall of up to eight and a half feet in height is planned along the south end of the parking area" - which is directly adjacent to the area where 125 students currently attend the Warren Walker School, on the church campus. These students are sensitive receptors, spending time outdoors to learn and play, and with open windows, especially during the COVID-19 era, to provide additional ventilation limiting disease spread. (2) Noise impact arising from construction. Again, much like the air impacts category, directly above, but likely to last significantly longer as the construction noise will exist

While the Guidelines provide opportunities for projects to be exempted from CEQA review, these exemptions are limited in nature. "Only those projects having no significant effect on the environment are categorically exempt from CEQA review." (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network, supra, at p. 1102.) A significant effect is a "substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in the environment." (Pub. Res. Code $21068. [Emphasis added.]) This means that an activity has a significant effect if, among other things, it "has the potential to degrade the quality of the environment." (Pub. Res. Code § 21083.) "[A]n activity that may have a significant effect on the environment cannot be categorically exempt." (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 124. [Emphasis added.])
The courts review categorical exemptions using strict construction in a manner affording the greatest environmental protection within the reasonable scope of the statutory language. (County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 966.) "[E]xemption categories are not to be expanded or broadened beyond the reasonable scope of their statutory language.' (Dehne v. County of Santa Clara (1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 827, 842.) Thus, an exemption must be applicable in light of the full scope of a project.
A public agency has the burden of proving that substantial evidence supports its factual finding that a project falls within the asserted exemption. (Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose, 54 Cal. App. 4th 106, 114-115 (1997); Magan v. County of Kings (2002) 105 Cal.App.4th 468, 475.) "An agency's duty to provide such factual support 'is all the more important where the record shows ...that opponents of the project have raised arguments regarding possible significant environmental impacts." (Muzzy Ranch Co. v. Solano County Airport Land Use Com. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 372, 386.) A city cannot impose a burden on the public to prove a possibility of adverse environmental impacts since this would frustrate CEQA's fundamental purpose of ensuring that government officials "make decisions with environmental consequences in mind." (Da vidon Homes, supra, at p. 116; California Farm Bureau Federation v. California Wildlife Conservation Bd. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 186.) "[T]he agency's exemption determination must be supported by evidence in the record demonstrating that the agency considered possible environmental impacts in reaching its decision." (Da vidon Homes, supra, at p. 117; East Peninsula Ed. Council, Inc. v. Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School Dist. (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 155, 171.)
The record before the City, limited as it is because of the lack of analysis performed by CityMark, reveals that the Project's potential effects on the environment make the application of a categorical exemption legally inappropriate. In fact, most of the environmental analysis performed, to date, has been by the church's experts and those analysis have not been challenged, nor apparently analyzed by the City.

which has been in place for over half a century and, thus, conflicts directly and inarguably with
this policy.
6) Objective UD-3.1 requires that development be "architecturally and environmentally sensitive and ...compatible with neighboring design and scale." As indicated in the discussions regarding Policy LU-1.2.2 and Policy LU-2.1.2 directly above, the Project is unlike anything in this neighborhood, especially with respect to its design and scale, and therefore, conflicts with this objective of the General Plan.
In short, the Project cannot be said to be in harmony with the City's General Plan Land Use and Urban Design Element as proposed. As such, it must be revised significantly to come into conformance with the General Plan, and the surrounding community.

II. The Project Fails To Comply With The California Environmental Quality Act
The primary purposes of CEQA are to inform City decisionmakers, as well as the public, about the potential impacts of a project, and to prescribe mitigation measures to avoid such impacts. CEQA requires a broad view of what constitutes a project requiring environmental analysis. (McQueen v. Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1143.) Even projects that appear benign will likely fall within the ambit of CEQA. (Bloom v. McGurk (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1307, 1312.) The California State Legislature formulated CEQA to "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of the environment shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions." (Pub. Res. Code §21001(d).) To implement this goal, CEQA requires municipalities to analyze discretionary projects for potential environmental impacts utilizing a three-tier system. (No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 74.) The first tier is known as a preliminary review. The preliminary review requires public agency staff to analyze a complete application in order to discern the full scope of the project at issue. (CEQA Guidelines section 15060(b); City of Pasadena V. The State of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 810, 836.) Once the parameters of the project are established, a determination is made to resolve whether an exemption is applicable to the project. If such an exemption is found, the agency must determine that no exceptions to the exemption are triggered by the potential impacts from the full scope of the project. (CEQA Guidelines §§ 15060, 15061.) If the project is not exempt from CEQA, or an exception is applicable, the second tier of review is required wherein an initial study is prepared because it has been determined that there is possibility that the project may have a significant effect on the environment. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063.) An initial study facilitates environmental assessment early in the design of a project. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063(c).) In the third tier, the initial study is used to demonstrate that either: a) the project "will not have a significant effect," triggering the preparation of a negative declaration, or b) the project is one "which may have significant effect on the environment," triggering the preparation of an (CEQA Guidelines § 15064.) environmental impact report ("EIR").

elements." (Resource Defense Fund v. County of Santa Cruz (1982) 133 Cal.App.3rd 800, 806.) CEQA imposes an obligation on La Mesa to assess the Project's consistency with the City's General Plan. (North Coast Rivers Alliance et al. v. Marin Municipal Water District (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 614, 633.) The Project, as designed and proposed, cannot be found to be consistent with the Land Use and Urban Design Element of the City's General Plan.

By way of example:

1) Policy LU-1.2.2 requires that "[a]s part of the development review process, City departments will review all future development to ensure that safety requirements are met, including building and fire codes, accessibility standards and crime prevention techniques. Yet, as indicated above, the City's failure to ensure that the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street indicates that no such review has been performed (or that, if it has, the requirement to ensure safety has been obviated) such that dangerous condition not only is permitted to exist, but it is being worsened by increasing the vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the area while also attempting to authorize a large development where a single-story structure currently exists, further reducing sight lines a on a dangerous curve in the road. Similarly, the proposed waivers to reduce parking space dimensions and drive aisle widths do not "ensure that safety requirements are met, including building and fire codes, [nor] accessibility standards.3 2) Policy LU-2.1.2 requires the City to "[s]upport infill development and subdivision proposals that reinforce neighborhood strengths and benefit neighborhood identity," yet the Project proposes a development which is so different in character and intensity from any other in the neighborhood, both with respect to its architectural style and the materials used on its exterior walls - none of which can be found elsewhere in this community. Thus, it cannot be said that this Project will "reinforce" the existing visual appeal of the community.
3) Policy LU-2.1.5 requires the implementation of projects in the "Mixed-Use Overlay Zone by promoting the rehabilitation of properties and new development that fits into the context of the existing neighborhoods while meeting the City's Urban Design Objectives for infill development." Again, as noted directly above, in #2, the Project is completely out of character and context with respect to the existing neighborhood such that this policy cannot be met. 4) Policy LU-4.2.3 requires that "[n]ew development shall provide adequate parking." As the Project specifically seeks to not only reduce parking space numbers below the City's normal standards, it also seeks to reduce the number below those permitted under the State Density Bonus Law (albeit, improperly attempting to do so via a waiver, as indicated in the immediately preceding two sections of this letter), Also, as indicated in the immediately preceding section, the Project does not provide adequate parking not only with respect to the reduced number of spaces it proposes, but also improperly attempts to reduce the dimensions of the spaces and the drive aisles around them a in a manner likely to impact the public's (and future residents') health and safety. Thus, the Project clearly conflicts with this policy as well.
5) Objective UD-1.1 requires the City's "It]o protect La Mesa's existing built environment and cultural heritage." But the Project proposes to destroy the LMWC clubhouse

B. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Not Permitted To Overcome Regulations That Pertain To Health And Safety
As mentioned above, the Project's requests for waivers are inapposite to the law because they pertain to financial rather than physical constraints. In addition, the Project improperly seeks to waive the City's standard parking space and driving aisle dimensions even though this would result in direct health and safety impacts. Waivers are impermissible on this
basis as well.
The dimensions of parking spaces and adjacent driving aisles are specified to ensure the safety of vehicles, their drivers and passengers, and pedestrians. (LMMC § 22.112.010(B).) This makes common sense - if spaces and driving aisles are too small, or otherwise constrained, they are likelier to lead to physical harm from other vehicles when vacating or entering a space and are
the reason why State building codes requires minimum parking dimensions to ensure health and safety. (DAB Staff Report, p. 3 & Attachment D, pp. 3-4; DRB Staff Report, p. 3 & Attachment E, pp. 3-4.)
Government Code section 65915(e)(1) of the State Density Bonus Law provides:
Nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted to require local government to
waive or reduce development standards if the waiver or reduction would have a specific, adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5, upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact.
[Emphasis added.]
Thus, a waiver cannot be used to avoid the specific, adverse impact arising from the reduction of a basic safety feature inherent in parking stall/space sizes and driving aisle dimensions as contemplated by the Project due to the health and safety issues it raises. No justification exists which would be sufficient to overcome this requested reduction in health and safety standards, nor would an incentive permit such a thing.
C. The Project, As Designed, Is Contrary To The Chief Land Use Policies Declared Under The Land Use And Urban Design Element Of The General Plan
California law requires each city and county to adopt a general plan, a comprehensive long- term plan for the development of that city or county, famously referred to by the state Supreme Court as the "constitution for future development." (Lesher Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 540.) A general plan must contain seven mandatory "elements," including a "land use element" to designate the level of intensity and general distribution of land uses. (Gov. Code § 65302.) "[T]he propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development depends upon [a finding of] consistency with the applicable general plan and its

PWM240

LAW OFFICE OF FELIX TINKOV
Ms. Kinnard

Pursuant to Government Code §65915(e)(1), waivers (as opposed to incentives) are afforded to density bonus project only when a "development standard will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development," not because the developer desires it, or because it will enhance the financial prospects of a project. Put another way, a waiver permits deviation from, or altogether evasion of, regulations which affect a project due to its site-specific physical features. This subject site has no such physical constraints. Rather, the balconies could be built outside of the pedestrian realm (i.e., within the building envelope) by moving the exterior walls along Grossmont Boulevard back four feet, or removed altogether. The applicant itself makes clear that it is not a physical constraint that drives this waiver request when it states its justification as follows:
This waiver is requested due to excessive space and cost impacts to incorporate the Open Space requirement and private balconies. The loss of development potential to incorporate this would make the project infeasible to provide the affordable units.
As mentioned above, the site itself does not have any physical obstruction which precludes construction of these balconies, rather CityMark simply desires to have them overhang the pedestrian realm because it would increase their financial incentive to develop the Project. The State Density Bonus Law permits this sort of deviation from regulation for financial gain through the use of incentives, of which the Project has two (waivers, on the other hand, are unlimited for such developments). Yet, the Project avoids using any of its incentives and instead improperly requests at least five waivers to avoid its open space requirements, building height limit, parking space sizing, landscaping required within the pedestrian realm, and overall parking requirements. In each such instance, CityMark indicates that the justification for the waiver is not a physical constraint unique to the site but rather the request is made to seek a financial boon for the
developer.

The reason the Project seeks to use waivers rather than incentives is clear on its face - the
State Density Bonus Law does not authorize a sufficient number of incentives (i.e., the Project requires five, but only has two available to it) to meet CityMark's desired financial goals, whereas it may request an unlimited number of waivers. Because it does not have sufficient incentives to
develop the Project in this manner, it attempts to avoid their use altogether and instead make faulty justifications for waivers which are impermissible under the law.
Because CityMark cannot show a physical constraint exists which limits the development of the Project under the City's laws and policies, it must use its incentives (and justify the use of
those incentives by showing the financial benefit gained thereby) and/or redesign the Project to be in conformity with the law.

§ 24.18.040(B).) The condition to pay a fee in lieu of an actual mitigation measure regarding a known project impact runs afoul of CEQA and should not be permitted. Rather the Project must be required to perform an analysis to determine the scope of the impact and to then propose a mitigation measure to reduce that impact to a less than significant level.
Moreover, this mitigation measure is improper on two other bases. First, it improperly attempts to defer mitigation until a later (and, in this case, unknown future) time. This is specifically forbidden under CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4 (a)(1)(B).) And second, a mitigation measure is only available if a project under CEQA is expected to generate a potentially significant impact on the environment, but the staff report indicates that the Project is exempt from CEQA because there are no such expected impacts. (DAB Staff Report, p. 7-8; see also DAB Staff Report, Attachment A, "Resolution No. DAB-2021-xx at Par. 1.) So, either the Project is not exempt from CEQA and cannot be conditioned to mitigate a potentially significant impact, or it must be analyzed properly under CEQA (i.e., by preparation of an Initial Study, followed by specific impact category studies, and the development of a mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report). The status quo does not comport with the law. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network V. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102 [a public agency may not adopt mitigation measures for project for the purpose of qualifying it for a categorical CEQA exemption; see also Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1200.)
A. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Limited To Overcoming Physical, Not Financial, Constraints Such That Avoiding Improvements To The Pedestrian Realm Are Not Permitted For This Project
As indicated above, the Project is designated Mixed Use Urban requiring improvements to the surrounding pedestrian realm. LMMC § 24.18.020(E) defines the term "pedestrian realm" as
follows:

"Pedestrian realm" means a twelve-foot wide area located between the face of the curb of a Circulation Element designated street and the face of the building. The pedestrian realm includes the parkway, sidewalk, and landscaped areas. The pedestrian realm may include both public and private property where the public right-of-way is not twelve feet wide. Pedestrian amenities, street trees, street furniture, bus stop facilities, and other landscaping, as specified in this chapter, shall be included in the public realm.
Notwithstanding this acknowledged requirement, "[w]aivers are being requested to allow reductions in…. pedestrian realm requirements." (DAB Staff Report, p. 3; DRB Staff Report, p. 3.) For instance, the Project seeks a "waiver" under the State Density Bonus Law so that it may encroach four feet into the pedestrian realm along Grossmont Boulevard by installing balconies hanging over this right of way. This miscomprehends what a waiver is under the law.

REQUEST FOR PREPARATION OF RECORD

Other ADR Processes: There are several other types of ADR which are not offered through the court but which may be obtained privately, including neutral evaluation, conciliation, fact finding, mini-trials, and summary jury trials. Sometimes parties will try a combination of ADR processes. The important thing is to try to find the type or types of ADR that are most likely to resolve your dispute. Be sure to learn about the rules of any ADR program and the qualifications of any neutral you are considering, and about their fees.

Local ADR Programs for Civil Cases

Mediation: The San Diego Superior Court maintains a Civil Mediation Panel of approved mediators who have met certain minimum qualifications and have agreed to charge $150 per hour for each of the first two (2) hours of mediation and their regular hourly rate thereafter in court-referred mediations.

On-line mediator search and selection: Go to the court's ADR webpage at www.sdcourt.ca.gov/adr and click on the "Mediator Search" to review individual mediator profiles containing detailed information about each mediator including their dispute resolution training, relevant experience, ADR specialty, education and employment history, mediation style, and fees and to submit an on-line Mediator Selection Form (SDSC form #CIV-005). The Civil Mediation Panel List, the Available Mediator List, individual Mediator Profiles, and Mediator Selection Form (CIV-005) can also be printed from the court's ADR webpage and are available at the Mediation Program Office or Civil Business Office at each court location.
Settlement Conference: The judge may order your case to a mandatory settlement conference, or voluntary settlement conferences may be requested from the court if the parties certify that: (1) settlement negotiations between the parties have been pursued, demands and offers have been tendered in good faith, and resolution has failed; (2) a judicially supervised settlement conference presents : substantial opportunity for settlement; and (3) the case has developed to a point where all parties are legally and factually prepared to present the issues for settlement consideration and further discovery for settlement purposes is not required. Refer to SDSC Local Rule 2.2.1 for more information. To schedule a settlement conference, contact the department to which your case is. assigned.
Arbitration: The San Diego Superior Court maintains a panel of approved judicial arbitrators who® have practiced law for a minimum of five years and who have a certain amount of trial and/or arbitration experience. Refer to SDSC Local Rules Division II. Chapter III and Code Civ. Proc. § 1141:10 et seq or contact the Arbitration Program Office at (619) 450-7300 for more information.

More information about court-connected ADR; Visit the court's ADR webpage at www.sdcourt.ca.gov/adr or contact the court's Mediation/Arbitration Office at (619) 450-7300.

Dispute Resolution Programs Act (DRPA) funded ADR Programs: The following community dispute resolution programs are funded under DRPA (Bus. and Prof. Code §§ 465 et seq.): In Central, East, and South San Diego County, contact the National Conflict Resolution Center (NCRC) at www.ncrconline.com or (619) 238-2400. In North San Diego County, contact North County Lifeline, Inc. at www.nclifeline.org or (760) 726-4900.
Private ADR: To find a private ADR program or neutral, search the Internet, your local telephone or buslness directory, or legal newspaper for dispute resolution, mediation, settlement, or arbitration services.

Legal Representation and Advice

To participate effectively in ADR, it is generally important to understand your legal rights and responsibilities and the likely outcomes if you went to trial. ADR neutrals are not allowed to represent or to give legal advice to the participants in the ADR process. If you do not already have an attorney, the California State Bar or your local County Bar Association can assist you in finding in an attorney. Information about obtaining free and low cost legal assistance is also available on the California courts website at www.courtinfo.ca.gov/selfhelp/lowcost.

ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION (ADR) INFORMATION

CASE NUMBER: 37-2021-00050398-CU-WM-CTL CASE TITLE: St Lukes Lutheran Church La Mesa California vs City of La N

NOTICE: All plaintiffs/cross-complainants in a general civil case are required to serve a copy of the following three forms on each defendant/cross-defendant, together with the complaint/cross-complaint: (1) this Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) Information form (SDSC form #CIV-730), (2) the Stipulation to Use Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) form (SDSC form #CIV-359), and (3) the Notice of Case Assignment form (SDSC form #CIV-721).
Most civil disputes are resolved without filling a lawsuit, and most civil lawsuits are resolved without a trial. The courts, community organizations, and private providers offer variety of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) processes to help people resolve disputes without a trial. The San Diego Superior Court expects that litigants will utilize some form of ADR as a mechanism for case settlement before trial, and it may be beneficial to do this early in the case.
Below is some information about the potential advantages and disadvantages of ADR, the most common types of ADR, and how to find a local ADR program or neutral. A form for agreeing to use ADR is attached (SDSC form #CIV-359).
Potential Advantages and Disadvantages of ADR ADR may have a variety of advantages or disadvantages over a trial, depending on the type of ADR process used and the particular case:

Potential Advantages Potential Disadvantages
Saves time May take more time and money if ADR does not
Saves money

• Gives parties more control over the dispute resolve the dispute

resolution process and outcome Procedures to learn about the other side's case (discovery), jury trial, appeal, and other court protections may be limited
. Preserves or improves relationships or unavailable

Most Common Types of ADR You can read more information about these ADR processes and watch videos that demonstrate them on the court's ADR
webpage at http://www.sdcourt.ca.gov/adr.
Mediation: A neutral person called "mediator" helps the parties communicate in an effective and constructive manner so they can try to settle their dispute. The mediator does not decide the outcome, but helps the parties to do so. Mediation is usually confidential, and may be particularly useful when parties want or need to have an ongoing relationship, such as in disputes between family members, neighbors, co-workers, or business partners, or when parties want to discuss non-legal concerns or creative resolutions that could not be ordered at a trial.
Settlement Conference: A judge or another neutral person called a "settlement officer" helps the parties to understand the strengths and weaknesses of their case and to discuss settlement. The judge or settlement officer does not make a decision in the case but helps the parties to negotiate a settlement. Settlement conferences may be particularly helpful when the parties have very different ideas about the likely outcome of a trial and would like an experienced neutral to help guide them toward a resolution. a
Arbitration: A neutral person called an "arbitrator" considers arguments and evidence presented by each side and then decides the outcome of the dispute. Arbitration is less formal than a trial, and the rules of evidence are usually relaxed. If the parties agree to binding arbitration, they waive their right to trial and agree to accept the arbitrator's decision as final. With nonbinding arbitration, any party may reject the arbitrator's decision and request a trial. Arbitration may be appropriate when the parties want another person to decide the outcome of their dispute but would like to avoid the formality, time, and expense of a trial.

St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California V. City of La Mesa; City of La Mesa City Council; City of La
Mesa Development Advisory Board, Case No. 37-2021-00022567-CU-MC-CTL, was a Petition for Writ of
Mandate regarding violations of the Ralph M. Brown Act and the La Mesa Municipal Code filed on May
24, 2021 in the San Diego Superior Court - Central Division ("Brown Act Case"), making this the first-filed
of the related matters.

The instant filing made on December 1, 2021, St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California v. City of
La Mesa (CityMark Communities LLC, Real Party-in-Interest), Case No. TBD, regards California Environmental Quality Act, California Public Records Act, and record retention violations ("CEQA Case").
The Brown Act Case and the CEQA Case (collectively, the "Cases") involve two of the "same parties,"
with the Respondent City of La Mesa as the primary defendant in each action. (Cal. R. Ct. 3.300(a)(1).)
Though these cases are based on wholly different and independent factual claims, and alleged violations
of law, the underlying activity relates to the City of La Mesa's administration of public notification, public
hearings, public records, and land-use approvals. Though consolidation of the cases is not. sought, is
judicial economy and efficiency dictates having the same judge hear this matter in light of the likely
overlap in underlying issues and parties.

The City has received comments on other issues. Although the CEQA Guidelines do not require the Clty to examine them, the City notes that these comments have shown neither unusual circumstances nor evidence of a potential impact on these other toplcs. There may be asbestos in the existing building, but that is nelther an unusual circumstance nor does it pose a substantial risk; asbestos, as the comments indicate, was often used in older construction, and ardinary demolition and construction techniques fully address and mitigale any risk that would arise. Comments about hydrology have been speculative, not evidence of an actual problem, and hydrology would not change from the existing conditions. Parking Is addressed as a density bonus issue and is not itself a CEQA issue. Similarly, community character is not a CEQA issue.
(e) The site can be and in fact already is adequately served by all required utilitles and public services.

Decision and Record:
The City has approved this exemption in reliance on the entirety of the record. which includes among other things:

The application materials and related reports, plans, and studles: Correspondence with the applicant and others; The General Plan and its EIR;
The Mixed Use Overlay and its EIR;
The Urban Design Program; and
The Municipal Code,

use of the exemption; and, even if unusual circumstances exist, that there is not sufflcient evidence to support fair argument of a potential impact,
(1)(A) Traffic quantity: The site is currently developed with a clubhouse, The record contains substantial evidence that the increase In traffic from the currently allowable use is less than significant. Indeed, the density is (with the density bonus law adjustment) as anticipated by the General Plan's EIR, and the Increase resulting from the Project Is less than the City's threshold for requiring further analysis. The project Is screened out from VMT analysis since it generates less than 200 ADT (net).
(1)(3) Traffic and pedestrian safety: There has been considerable public comment about potential pedestrian and visibility concerns. However, the comments concern the existing
situation, and there is not substantial evidence either that the development and occupancy of the Project will create an unusual circumstance or that the development and occupancy of the Project will cause a signllicant increase in the risk from the current sltuation. Indeed, the Project will reduce existing risks by removing the existing off-street parking along Grossmont Boulevard, which will improve visibility; by constructing the first floor of the building with an appropriate setback to provide 309 feet of cornor sight distance; and by restriping Grossmont Boulevard to Improve bicycle mobility and sight lines, and provide crosswalks.
Comments from the public have shown some confusion regarding a proposed condition requiring the applicant to contribute to a curb ramp. The applicant agreed to this condition voluntarily as a goodwill gesture. The City has not imposed the conditlon as mitigation of an impact, The result of the appllcant's gesture will again improve the existing situation,
(2) Noise: There are no unusual circumstances involving this Project. Furthermore, there is no evidence that any increase in noise generated by this Project, after crediting the existing development, would be significant or significantly greater than what had been contemplated by the uses allowed by the General Plan and studied In the General Plan's EIR. Additionally, the EIR for the Mixed-Use Overlay Zone found that the Impacts from noise, both short-term (construction phase) and long-torm (implemented project), would be less than significant due to compliance with foderal, state, and local laws regulating noise. In addition, the comments the City has recelved are speculation, not evidence.
(3) Air quality: There are no unusual oircumstances involving this Project. Furthermore, there is no evidence that any increase in pollution generated by this Project, after crediting the existing development, would be significant or significantly different from or greater than what had been contemplated by the uses allowed by the General Plan and studied in the General Plan's EIR. In addition, the comments the City has received are speculation, not evldence.
(4) Water quality: There are no unusual circumstances Involving this Project. Furthermore, there is no evidence that any Increase in water pollution runoff generated by this Project, after crediting the existing development, would be significant or significantly different from or greater than what had been contemplated by the uses allowed by the General Plan and studied in the General Plan's EIR. In addition, the comments the City has recelved are
speculation, not evidence. Flow controi requirements will bo met through the use of storm
water vault and low flow orifice to reduce rates below the pre-development conditlon. Site design measures such as dlsperston, amended solls, and the use of tree wells will supplement standard requirements such as biofiltration and SWPPPs, storm drain stenciling, protection of outdoor storage, and protection of trash storage so as to ensure that no impact will occur.

UD-2.1.1: Give careful attention to Urban Design •Standards related to building scale, architectural materials, landscaping, and other elements to emphasize attractive bulding and site design in new developments and redevelopments. The Project is consisfent with this Policy by having boon designed in an attractive manner by a well-regarded architect.
UD-2.1.6: Consider shared parking, parking reductions and/or parking management plans to reduce the amount of physical space devoted exclusively to parking vehicles. Parking lot landscaping should further water conservation goals. The Project is consistent with this Policy by providing parking as required by the state density bonus law, with an adjustment to ensure efficient use of the availabie physical space.
UD-3.1.1: Encourage resource-efficient building techniques, materials, and principles of sustalnable design in new construction and renovation. The Project is consistent with this Policy by using sustainable, Title 24 construction tochniques and materials.
The City approved community-level environmental review by certifying environmental impact reports ("EIRs") in 2013 for the General Plan and In 2008 for the Mixed Use Overlay Zone. Mitigation measures from the Mixed Use Overlay Zone EIR related to air quality will be imposed on the •Project as conditions of approval. The EIR found that the Impacts from noise and hazardous materiais, both short-term (construction phase) and long-term (implemented project), would be loss than signiflcant due to compliance with federal, state, and local laws regulating noise and hazardous materlals.
The RB-D-MU zone allows the proposed uses. The Project is consistent with zoning except as allowed or required by the density bonus law. There are no applicable setback requirements other than those associated with the pedestrian realm along Grossmont Boulevard. The Project's landscaping plan provides for 3,889 square feet of vegetated area. The landscaping plan proposes 22 specimen-size trees, including 11 crape myrtle street trees in 36-Inch boxes as well as parking lot trees such as elm, fern pine, and arbutus in 24-inch and 36-inch boxes. The plan proposes a palette of 25 shrubs in street planters and around the perimeter of the slte. The landscape and irrigation concept plan conforms to the State water efficient landscape ordinance, the City's landscape standards, and the City's street tree program. Planned improvements in the right-of-way include 12-foot pedestrian realm with contiguous sidewalk and landscaping along Grossmont Boulevard, a curb ramp, new non-contiguous sidewalk and landscape planters along Wilson Street, and street trees along both street frontages at a rate of 1 tree per 35 lineal feet.
(b) The proposed development occurs within the limits of the City of La Mesa. The site contains less than five (5) acros and is surrounded by existing urban uses.
(c) The site has no value as habitat, as it was previously developed with a structure and pavement.
(d) Approval of the Project would not result in any significant effects relating to trafflo, noise, air quality, or water quality.
There has been considerable public comment on these issues, The City finds, based on substantial evidence in the record, that there are not unusual circumstances that would preclude

LU-1.2.2: As part of the development review process, City departments will review all future development to ensure that safety requirements are met: including building and fire codes, accessibility standards and crime prevention techniques. The Project is consistent with this Pollcy by meoting or exceoding all requiroments of construclion
codes.

• LU-2.1.5: Implement the Mixed-Use Overlay Zone by promoting the rehabilitation of properties and new development that fits into the context of the existing neighborhoods while meeting the City's Urban Design Objectives for infl development. The Project is consistent with this Pollcy by replacing a very a old (circa 1960) development with new homes and commercial space on a site that is surrounded by existing urban devolopment.

LU-3.1.5: Promote more Intensive mixed-use and sustainable development in
commercial areas consistent with the Urban Design Program. The Project is consistent
with this Policy by providing sustainably designed, mixed-use apartments so as to help maintain the viabillty of the adjacent commercial areas. The City's Design Review Board has revlewed the Project and agreed that it is consistent with the City's Urban Design
Program.

LU-4.1.1: Opportunities for affordable housing should exist in all residential areas to support the policies and programs for the City's Housing Element.

L.U-4.2.5: Increased residental densities may be allowed by a Site Development Plan subject to a Density Bonus Program set forth in the Municipal Code. Development of senior or lower-Income affordable housing may utilize the provisions of State Density Bonus Law as amended from time to time. The Project is consistent with this Policy by providing an Increased density and price-restricted units pursuant to the state density
bonus law.

UD-1.1.2: For mixed use projects, ground floor commercial uses are encouraged to be oriented to the streets and sidewalks to encourage an appealing pedestrian experience, The Project is consistent with this Policy by providing ground floor commercial uses that
are oriented to Grossmont Boulevard and satisfy the City's pedostrian realm goals. The projoct proposes to help ignite the transformation of Grossmont Boulevard into a
pedestrian-orlented mixod-use zone with easy and walkable access to transit and the surrounding commerclal areas.

CEQA Exemption:
The exemption cited is CEQA Guidelines §15332, which reads:
Class 32 consists of projects characterized as in-fill development meeting the conditions described in this section. (a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable generaf plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations. (b) The proposed dovelopment ocours within city limits on project site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses. (c) The project site has no value, as habltat for endangered, rare or threatened species. (d) Approval of the projeot would not result In any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality. (e) The site can be adequately served by all required utillties and public services.
CEQA Guidelines 515300.2(b) makes this exemption inapplicable "when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time, is significant." There are no other antlcipated projects of this type In the vicinity.
CEQA Guidelines §15300.2(c) prohibits the use of this exemption "where a there is a reasonable possibillty that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." The California Supreme Court, in Berkeley Hillside Preservation v. City of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1086, held that courts should (i) defer to lead agencies (e.g., the City) to decide, based on substantial evidence in the record, whether there were "unusual circumstances," and (Il) only If there were unusual circumstances, determine whether enough evidence had been presented to support a "fair argument" that there could be a "significant effect." No unusual circumstances have been determined to be present.
CEQA Guidelines $15300.2(d) prohlbits the use of the exemption for a project "which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees, historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources, within a highway offlcially designated as a state scenic highway." The project would not result in damage to scenic resources within a state scenic highway.
CEQA Guidelines §15300.2(e) prohibits the use of the exemption for a project located on a hazardous waste site. The project site is not a hazardous waste site.
CEQA Guidelines §15300.2(0 prohibits the use of the exemption for a project which may cause a substantlal adverso change in the significance of a historical resource. The City finds, based
on substantial evidence in the record, that 5220 Wilson Street ts not considered a historical a resource for the purposes of CEQA.
The Project meets the oriteria of Section 15332. Evaluating each of the criteria individually:
(a) The project is consistent with the applicable General Plan deslgnation and applicable General Plan policies. The General Plan designates the slte Mixed Use Urban, which allows residential development at up to 40 dulac in combination with commercial uses. Applicable Policies in the General Plan include:

PWM831

Parking, commercial: MUNICIPAL CODE §24.04.050.F requires 1 space per 500 sq.ft. of floor area
for the Project's 1,346 sq.ft. of commercial space requires three (3) spaces for the commercial area. The project provides 3 parking spaces for commercial area, for a total of 74 parking
spaces.

The density bonus law (GOVERNMENT CODE §65915(d)(2)(B)) allows two (2) "Incentives" for projocts that reserve at least 10% of their units for very low-income households. The appilcant has not requested Incentives.

The density bonus law (GOVERNMENT CODE §65915(e)) also requires that the City grant a "waiver or reduction" of any "development standard" that "will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development meeting the criteria of subdlvision (b) [i.e., the density bonus project] at the densitles or with the concessions or incentives permitted by this section." The applicant has requested the following waivers or reductions:

Reduction in recreational open space: The City's standard for a mixed-use project in the MU Overlay zone is 200 sq. ft. per unit, which would require 9,800 square feet for 49 units. The Project would provide 3,171 sq. ft. of qualifying recreation area in a ground a floor common area, on a roof terrace, at the entry plaza, and on private balconies. The Project would provide an additional 2,423 sq.ft. of non-quallfying area, primarily in small balconies.

Increase in bullding height: The MU Overlay zone allows structures to be 46 feet in height The Project would be one foot, eight inches above that to allow a four-story
development. The waiver is necessitated by sloping conditions on the site that result in additional height as defined in the Municipal Code at the south end of the building.
Reduction of parking space and aisle width sizes: The Municipal Code also specifles parking space and aisle width sizes. The Project would make some of the spaces and aisles smaller than ordinarily required.
Reduction of landscaping: The Municipal Code requires certain amounts of landscaping in the parking area and perimeter. The Project proposes reduced amounts.

Reduction of pedestrian realm requirements: The Municipal Code requires setbacks
from pedestrian sidewalks. The ground floor of the Project complies with the 12-foot pedestrian realm requirement. However, the upper-story baiconles along Grossmont Boulevard will overhang the sidewalk by up to four (4) feet. This would not reduce the space avallable for pedestrian travel.
For each of these, the applicant has shown that applying the City's usual requirements would preclude construction of the density bonus project. The recreatlonal open space, parking, landscaping, and pedestrian realm requirements would alt require additional space that (9 unavailable on this parcel and which would thus reduce the space and number of units available for donsity bonus units. The reduction in parking arises partly from space limitations and partly from the noed to place structural support where parking could go. Support for these facts appears in the record.

Entitlements:
The Municipal Code requires that the City's Development Advisory Board consider a site development plan for new development in the MU zone. The D overlay on the site's zoning requires that the City's Design Review Board consider a design review for new development. a
Proposed Project:
Applicant CityMark Communities LLC proposes to demollsh the existing clubhouse building and parking lot and redevelop the site with a 49-unit, mixed-use apartment building (the "Project") in a single, L-shaped, four-story building. The Project would include 1,346 square feet of ground- floor commercial retall space along Grossmont Boulevard, along with various pedestrian- orlented improvements such as a wider sidewalk and street trees. The record contains the Project's plans.
The Project will require approximately 400 cubic yards of excavation (cut) and 1,400 cubic yards of fill, resulting in a net of 1,000 cubic yards of import. The fill will be used primarily to raise the rear of the site to establish a pad for the parking area. A retaining wall of up to 8-1/2' in height is planned along the south end of the parking area, The Project will not affect the existing driveway access serving the church to the south.
The Project includes an affordable housing density bonus pursuant to GOVERNMENT CODE §65915 and Chapter §24.053 of the MUNICIPAL CODE. Zoning allows 40 du/ao; for a 0.887-acre site, that allows 35.48 unlts. Section 24.053.050.A rounds that up to 36 units. The Project wlll reserve 4 units to be affordable to very-low-Income households (50% of area median income); at slightly over 11% of the base project, that results in a density bonus of 35% of the base project (GOVERNMENT CODE $65915(f), i.e., 12.6 units, which MUNICIPAL CODE $24.053.050 rounds up to 13, for a total of 38+-13= 49 units. The applicant and the City will enter into an and CC&Rs to memorialize the affordable housing affordable housing regulatory agreement requirements. The record Includes an Affordable Homes Bonus Program Report.
There has been some public commontary regarding whether the use and density are "by right." They are because the state density bonus law (GOVERNMENT CODE $65915(f) and (o)(4)) requires that, unless the applicant requeste otherwise, the bonus be based on "the otherwise maximum allowable gross residentlal density." MUNICIPAL CODE $24.053.050.B.1, to be consistent with state law, also requires that density bonus projects be based on the maximum denslty; the maximum density allowed this site by both the General Plan and zoning is 40 du/ac. is
Density Bonus Incentives and Waivers:
Density bonus projects requires citles to change the way they apply thelr usual requirements,
Parking, residential: GOVERNMENT CODE §65915(p) prahibits cities from requiring more than one (1) parking space per studio and one-bedroom apartments or two (2) parking spaces per two- or three- bedroom apartments. The Project will have 27 one-bedroom units and 22 two- and three- bedroom units. Thus, the City may not demand more than 71 spaces for the residential units: 27 for the one-bedroom units and 44 (=2 x 22) for the larger units. The applicant is providing a total of 71 spaces for the residential units.

Notice of Exemption

Project Site:
The 0.887-acre site is located at the southwest corner of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson
Street. The site slopes gently downhill from north to south. The southerly 20 feet of the site is improved with a driveway and parking that is used by a church to the south. The driveway was a plotted as right-of-way called Fillmore Avenue on an early subdivision map, but the City vacated the right-of-way in 1987. The record contains a title report and Assessor's maps showing the driveway is part of the subject parcel.
The site itself was developed in the 1960s with single-story, 5,560 sq.ft. clubhouse building and surface parking that are still present. Although pandemic lockdowns have limited use of the existing clubhouse and parking since March 2020, before that both had been used regularly for meetings and events.

Surrounding Aroa:

Surrounding development, along Grossmont Boulevard Is commercial. Across Grossmont Boulevard to the north are a shopping center and a major motor vehicle dealership. An automobile repair business is along Grossmont Boulevard to the east. There are professlonal offices to the west. To the south, across what had been Fillmore Avenue, is a church property that includes a private elementary school, There are some single-family homes farther to the south and west. The record contalns maps and photographs of the vicinity.

General Plan and Zoning:

The City's General Plan designates the site Mixed Use Urban, with residential densities up to 40 dwelling units per acre (du/ac). The City has zoned the site RB-D-MU: Residential Business ("RE") with an Urban Design Overlay (D) and a Mixed Use (MU) overlay. The General Plan identifles "RB" zoning as a type of zoning that is "most consistent" with the plan designation. The RB zone allows for-sale homes, condominiums, and apartments and encourages mixed- use projects. The MU overlay supports pedestrian-frlendly housing such as row housing, loft- type dwellings, and flats, arranged around courtyards or linearly, and situated close to the street at a density of up to 40 du/ac. The MU overlay requires that development include pedostrian improvements along aollector streets in order to encourage pedestrian activity.
The Circulation Element of the City's General Plan olassifles Grossmont Boulevard as a major a collector street subject to pedestrian realm requirements. Wllson Street is designated as a local street. The Land Use Element of the General Plan Identifies Grossmont Boulevard as a "minor a
path."

Further, this firm has learned that staff provided the Applicant with extensive historical information regarding the subject site, but now claim that this information no longer exists so that it is inaccessible to the public, or this Council. Without this information, the public is disadvantaged in confirming, or disproving, the historical analysis provided by the Applicant. Though this may seem a minor point, it is not. By destroying, withholding, or otherwise not retaining records pertinent to this Project, the City runs afoul of a basic CEQA precept - a record of the proceedings, also known as an administrative record, must include all written materials relevant to the determination for the project's environmental review. (Public Res. Code cop 21167.6(e).) Our local 4th District Court of Appeal recently affirmed that an incomplete administrative record requires the invalidation of a Project's CEQA approval. (Golden Door Properties, LLC v. Superior Court (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 733, 763 [finding San Diego County's CEQA approval of a project invalid based upon the agency's failure to retain records required under Public Resources Code section 21167.6(e).1.) As the Court put it, the record is "to include pretty much everything that ever came near a proposed development or to the agency's compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act." (Id. at p.762 [quoting Madera Oversight Coalition, Inc. V. County of Madera (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 48, 64.].) In this instance, it appears the City failed to retain some fairly significant record information relating to a potentially significant impact arising from the Project.
This firm has also recently learned that at least four (4) sets of records regarding the Project all of which are legally mandated to be retained under Public Resources Code section 21167.6(e) have not been retained by the City. It is likely that other such failures to observe the record retention requirements under CEQA will be uncovered if this case is litigated. As the Golden Door Propertics Court precedent indicates, this will be fatal to the Project's CEQA exemption approval.
In light of the above facts in the record (and, in part, because of those documents which are missing from the record), an exemption from CEQA analysis is indefensible and will be overturned. The Council must right this ship by directing staff to properly, and thoroughly, review the Project's impacts as the law prescribes.

Conclusion

The DAB's initial determination is void on its face in light of that legislative body's Brown Act violations. Rather than ratify the DAB's decision the City must rescind the Project's approvals and require a complete reconsideration. Part of that reconsideration must include a thorough a analysis of the La Mesa Woman's Club's historical significance followed by a thoughtful determination from the HPC. Thereafter, the appropriate level of CEQA analysis, based upon all of the Project's impacts, must be concluded and reviewed in legally compliant manner. Contrary to the intimations of the City staff and the Applicant's counsel, this Project's application under the SDB does not give it a free pass under CEQA. In light of the Project's unequivocal generation of

Architectural Historian with Landmark Historic Preservation
(http://www.preservesandiego.com/aboutus.html),all opine that the site is historic, and that the Applicant's report is clearly devoid of analysis and fact, the response from staff is that these experts are merely speculating and that the report provided for the Project is the only substantial evidence on the topic. Each of these experts (all of whom have, for years, worked on historic preservation,
inventory, and planning a mere Google search would prove this up) has indicated various substantive facts pertaining to the historically important works of the La Mesa Woman's Club, the uncommon architectural style of the subject clubhouse, and/or the acclaim of the architect, Herluf Jensen Brydegaard, who designed it, specifying the historic criteria which this site mects under
Federal and State law. Each of these experts also indicates the obvious deficiencies of the Applicant's historic resources analysis which is geared towards showing little to no information which could result in a proper understanding of the facts.
The unusual circumstance of the La Mesa Woman's Club being a potentially historic site leaves this Council with little choice but to order CEQA analysis of the Project in that it cannot be afforded an exemption from environmental review - the facts demand this, and the Council is not permitted under the law to ignore this. Four experts in the field have opined the Project's demolition of the La Mesa Woman's Clubhouse, without proper historic review, will result in
significant impacts. Three senior City staff have explicitly stated the same in writing. Notwithstanding the deficient report presented by the Applicant, and the "new story" formulated in the staff report, the Council may not turn blind eye to the substantive evidence in the record reflecting the need to analyze the site for historic preservation. This can be done by sending the Project to the City's Historic Preservation Committee (*HPC*), where experts can further analyze the matter and suggest mitigation measures. Doing any less is to submit to misinformation presented in the staff report with no chance of correcting the mistake once it is made.
Were the above information not sufficient to prove up the staff report's lack of authenticity and reliability, this firm has recently uncovered an email exchange which add further evidence of staff attempting to "hide the ball." City Planner Kinnard and yet another historical expert, Carmen
Pauli, Principal Architect of Heritage Architecture & Planning
(https://heritagearchitecture.com/about/our-people/carmen-pauli/),communicated via email between July 14 and July 15, 2021, regarding the historicity of the La Mesa Woman's Club and the need to bring this Project before the HPC in light of the potentially significant impacts arising from its proposed demolition. The email exchanges reflect staff's dismissive take on the Project's review by the HPC and further analysis under CEQA, notwithstanding Ms. Pauli's 20 years of experience in the field of historical preservation architecture. But stranger than this is that these comments appear to have been left off the staff reports made to the Planning Commission and to this Council. It is unclear why staff would not include this information unless it was to avoid showing that a fifth expert in historical preservation opposed their illegitimate determination to exempt the Project from CEQA analysis notwithstanding the historicity of the subject site.

C. "As a mixed-use project (and underparked in my opinion) it should be facilitating ped/bike use, but is providing almost nothing in the way of facilities. They are disputing the Grossmont crosswalk requirement and there is not even a curb ramp proposed to cross Wilson St.;" and
d. "The on-street parking impacts and cut-through traffic are very sensitive issues with the community. What kind of leverage do we have to rectify this?" Though staff now point to an updated traffic study which, unsurprisingly, claims to show no impacts arising the Project (that is, finding that a 49-unit development
and three commercial spaces will produce only 180 more daily trips than the
rarely-used La Mesa Woman's Club so that no VMT analysis is purportedly
required), it is quite obvious that ALL of the mitigation measures suggested by
Mr. Kern have been taken up as conditions on the Project - such mitigation measures make it clear that no exemption from CEQA review is permissible. (Anderson First Coalition V. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173 1186-87 [finding that where mitigation measures are imposed, a project cannot be said to have no impacts and, therefore, cannot be exempt from CEQA review.]
Whereas the staff report claims no impacts arise from this Project, the City's own experts (that is, the City's cngineering and planning staff), in their own words, have explicitly said otherwise. Any claim now that the mitigation measures imposed on the Project are voluntary traffic improvements and financial contributions are shameful perversions of the facts being foisted on the Council and the public. This must be corrected by the Council through a reasoned view of the facts before it. CEQA does not permit the City to simply ignore substantial evidence SO that a favored position may be taken to the detriment of the environment. (John R. Lawson Rock & Oil, Inc. V. State Air Resources Bd. (2018) 20 Cal.App.5th 77, 101-102.)
Were this not sufficient, there are further egregious examples of the staff "circling the wagons" in defense of this Project, rather than taking an objective and reasoned view on its
impacts. Community Development Director Kusiak, Project Planner Allyson Kinnard, and City
Manager Greg Humora all opined that the La Mesa Woman's Club is a historic site - the
communications on this point were provided in our August 3, 2021 appeal letter. Now historical preservation experts including (1) Todd Pitman, ASLA, and Assistant Director of Campus Planning and Campus Landscape Architect, University of California, San Diego (https://www.linkedin.com/in/todd-pitman-9ba2a7b4/), (2) Bruce Coons and Amie Hayes, Executive Director and Senior Historic Resources Specialist, respectively, of the Save Our Hcritage Organisation (notably, this an organization Mr. Kusiak indicated as a resource for historical analysis when questioned by Mr. Humora in an email dated May 28, 2019) (http://www.sohosandiego.org/main/staffbrucecoons.htm;

required by law. (Id. at p. 1112; Protect Telegraph Hill v. City and County of San Francisco (2017) 16 Cal.App.5th 261, 270.)
The substantial evidence of significant impacts on the environment have been well documented by expert opinion throughout the record - not "mere speculation," as staff and the Applicant, through its counsel, claim. What is most surprising is that staff (who are considered expert in these matters as well) have repeatedly indicated in email exchanges (which were, of course, not expected to be exposed to public scrutiny) that they had concerns over the Project's impacts. By way of example:
(1) in a December 10, 2020 email, Leon Firsht, the Director of Public Works and City Engineer, argues for the Project's installation of crosswalks "because residents of the project would shop at Wal Mart [sic] and the project had addressed vehicle corner and stopping sights distances, but not for peds. Also, if the project was proposing alternate modes of transportation how would residents get to the bus stops at La Mesa Blvd and Grossmont Blvd?" Now that those conditions have been placed on the Project, staff and the Applicant, argue they are not mitigation for the Project's impacts when the record evidence is clearly to the contrary;
(2) in a February 18, 2021 email, Project Planner Allyson Kinnard explains that she will condition the Project on implementing "an outreach program to minimize the number of two-plus vehicle families, inform and educate residents about the benefits of active transportation (biking and walking) and local transit opportunities to reduce the overall number of trips..." and require the imposition of a '$5k contribution towards curb ramps at SE corner of the intersection" with Mr. Kusiak acknowledging, on February 22, 2021, "[t]here are CEQA implications" for doing so and staff agreeing to represent this as a voluntary effort; Yet the staff report before the Council indicates these are voluntary measures, not mitigation for well-understood impacts arising from the
Project;

(3) in a November 16, 2020 email, City Engineering Project Manager Phil Kern states that he has "a number of concerns on this project." He then clarifies this by enumerating
that:
a. "The TAL2 shows 0% traffic on Hayes St. My gut tells me as soon as Wilson/Grossmont backs up in the AM residents will take a right instead of a left out of the project and buzz down Hayes to get to I-8"; b. "Somebody apparently waived the TAL requirement to model the adjacent intersections, so there is no way to verify the impacts";

it "has some feature that distinguishes it from others in the exempt class, such as its size or location"; and (2) there is "a reasonable possibility of a significant effect due to that unusual circumstance." (Id.)
In this instance, Wood Environment & Infrastructure Solutions' has indicated that unusual circumstances exist because of the Project's immediate proximity to two types of sensitive receptors - the school children at the Warren Walker School on the Church's campus, directly abutting the 5220 Wilson Street, and the senior living apartments across the street, both of which are particularly susceptible to air quality and noise impacts from the proposed construction, including 400 cubic yards of cut and 1,400 cubic yards of fill, along with the concomitant trucks and heavy machinery this entails. Though the staff has dismissed this issue by claiming the Project will not cause any impacts because it must adhere to the City's standard regulations, this sorely misses the point. For instance, the noise ordinance only limits construction between 10 p.m. and 7 a.m. - a time having little to do with lessening the impact on school-aged students in classrooms. Even a brief review of the Project's conditions indicates no thought has been given to mitigating such impacts as it is absolutely bereft of any mention of noise control during school hours/semesters.

As to whether there is a reasonable possibility that an unusual circumstance will produce a significant effect on the environment, the fair argument standard applies - meaning one need only a show a fair argument of a reasonable possibility the project will have a significant effect on the environment. (Id. at p. 1115.) If there is substantial evidence of a reasonable possibility the project will have such an effect, the agency may not rely on the exemption even if there is evidence to the contrary. (Id. at p. 1112.) A reviewing court determines whether substantial evidence supports the agency's conclusion as to whether the prescribed fair argument could be made. (Id. at p. 1115.) If the court perceives substantial evidence that there is a reasonable possibility the project will have a significant environmental impact, but the agency relied on the exemption, the agency's action is to be set aside because the agency abused its discretion by failing to proceeding in a manner

1 The Applicant's counsel questions whether Wood Environmental & Infrastructure Solutions ("Wood Environmental") is qualified to opine on the Project's CEQA impacts. Wood Environmental is an internationally recognized leader in the field of in environmental and engineering analysis, review, and sustainability practices with over 40,000 employees operating in over 60 countries - see https://www.woodplc.com/company/our-business.It conducted its review of the Project through its subsidiary, the San Diego office of AMEC Foster Wheeler (which Wood Environmental acquired in 2017). Contrary to the aspersions cast by Applicant's counsel, and in plain view of the out-of-date list of CEQA experts presented at
https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/dam/sdc/pds/ProjectPlanning/docs/CeqaConsultantsList.pdf,both Wood Environmental and AMEC Foster Wheeler are prominently listed, multiple times as CEQA experts. Their credibility and expertise in the field is unassailable, and easily a match for that of the Applicant's consultants. By necessity, the Applicant's reports are more detailed in that they have greater access to the subject property, but they are nevertheless open to dispute by the experts hired by the Church, contrary to the statements made by Applicant's counsel, and City staff.

1117 [a city council's rescission of all actions taken in response to Brown Act violations alleged in a demand to cure and correct is the proper course.].) The only thing that is left to question is whether the Council will spare itself and its constituents from unnecessary expense and time in resolving the a DAB's violations in a manner compliant with the law.
Further to the issue of the City's mismanagement of public hearings under the Brown Act, this firm has recently secured communications which appear to indicate additional violations exist
as to the Planning Commission hearing with respect to this Project. Community Development Director Kusiak, on July 20, 2021, emailed (at least) a quorum of the City's Planning Commissioners asking for offline conversations with each in preparation for a hearing on the Project. His stated intent was to coach the Commissioners because this was "[n]ot the usual Commission fare." Two days later, the Planning Commission, in lock-step, refused to hear about, or discuss, the Project's impacts on the historic La Mesa Woman's Club clubhouse from a number of experts and voted unanimously to reject the appeal. Whether Mr. Kusiak's actions led to this result remains to be seen though the information will undoubtedly come out. It should be noted that the City's outside counsel has offered to investigate these potentially violative serial communications outside of the public's view but has offered no indication of having concluded (or even started) this effort prior to the subject hearing. Notwithstanding this, what should be clear is that this sort of serial communication, with potential implications for violation of the Brown Act, a is a regular pattern arising from lack of oversight. A course correction is in order. The Council, as the leaders of the City, should take this opportunity to provide the necessary supervision to ensure this matter is resolved once and for all, and to ensure staff not repeat these
errors.

The decision before the Council is a straightforward one. On the one hand, the Council can continue to adhere to the recommendations of staff who have admitted to violations of the Brown Act, sought to cover it up, and litigate a losing battle which will eventually result in voiding the DAB's decision and bringing this matter back for the cure of rescission and reconsideration, all at the expense of your constituency, the taxpayers. Or, the Council may uphold the appeal and direct the staff to process the Project in accord with the law -something, which should have been done half a year, and many tens of thousands of dollars, ago.

CEQA Violations

In Berkeley Hillside Preservation v. City of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal.4th 1086, the California Supreme Court found that "[a]s to projects that meet the requirements of a categorical exemption [under CEQA], a party challenging the exemption has the burden of producing evidence supporting an exception." (Id. at p. 1105.) For the unusual circumstances exception, this may be done in one of two ways. One may identify "evidence that the project will have a significant effect
on the environment." (Id.) Alternatively, one may show evidence (1) the project is unusual because

Perhaps further information will alay [sic] your Client's concerns regarding Brown Act Violations by the Development Advisory Board (DAB). First, a draft ordinance a eliminating the DAB is scheduled for consideration by the La Mesa City Council on May 25, 2021 (agenda available on May 21, 2021) ("Ordinance"). Staff and the City Attorney's office will be recommending adoption. In La Mesa, the Mayor and the City Manager set the Council agenda. My strong anticipation is that the Ordinance will be adopted. [Emphasis added.]
(9) on both May 7, 2021 and May 13, 2021, Mr. Sabine offered to take one of the curative
actions required under the Brown Act, but rather than have the Council make this decision as the
law provides, he suggested that staff could act alone, stating:
Also, because of the issues raised in your correspondence, if so requested by your Client, City staff would be happy to "redo" the March 8, 2021 DAB hearing on the development project planned at 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, California.

(10) on May 25, 2021, staff recommended the Council disband the DAB, but not rescind its determination on the Project, and altogether failed to inform the Council as to the alleged violations of the Brown Act claimed under the Demand to Cure and Correct.

Now, in light of the above facts, the staff report to the Council for this October 26, 2021 hearing altogether denies that the DAB violated the Brown Act in direct contradiction of the City's filing in the ongoing litigation which provides, in pertinent part, "Accordingly, any alleged Brown Act violations have ultimately been cured by the elimination of the DAB." The Council should take serious pause in this - the staff speak out of both sides of their mouths to defend defenseless actions taken in violation of the law, compounded by their carelessness in not timely bringing this matter to the Council's attention. The Council need not.

The courts have clarified that the appropriate course in such instances is not only to ensure that no future Brown Act violations are made (i.e., by dissolution of the DAB), but that past violations be cured by rescission and thorough reconsideration of the matter -- not mere ratification of violative decision-making as the staff asks this Council to do. (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 1167, 1173 [finding the Merced Board of Supervisors acted appropriately in ordering its Planning Commission to rescind approval and rehear a land use project in its totality to cure a Brown Act violation].) The Applicant's counsel suggests you need not do so. But the Applicant can be cavalier about this issue since it is the City which is solely named in the ongoing litigation, and it is only the City which (or, more accurately, the City's taxpayers who) will be liable for its own and this law firm's fees when the case is resolved. The issue as to the correct course for the Council with respect to the DAB's violations of the Brown Act is not up for debate. (Page V. MiraCosta Community College Dist. (2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 471, 505 [finding that legislative body actions taken outside of meetings compliant with the Brown Act be rescinded.]; Boyle v.

The challenge centers on the contention that the staff that make up the DAB (Director of Community Development, Director of Public Works, Building Official, and Fire Marshall) have serial meetings in violation of the Act. The
attorney notes that the staff on the board necessarily interact outside of public meetings to perform the function of project review.
In this regard, I think the attorney may be on point. To remedy this situation, I
suggest that the DAB be eliminated as soon as possible and replaced with an administrative review process under the authority of the Community Development Director.... [Emphasis added.]

the Brown Act:

After discussions with the City Attorncy, we both agree that your suggestions regarding the DAB should be implemented.
(8) on May 13, 2021, City Attorney Sabine, sought to avoid the consequences of having failed to timely bring the Demand to Cure or Correct to the Council's attention (the Brown Act required the Council take curative action by May 7, 2021), explaining that he would do so in the future while admitting that Brown Act violations occurred but that he was fairly certain the Council would eventually take corrective action:

Re: Appeal of CEQA Exemption for Mixed Use Development Proposed At 5220 Wilson Street (Project No. 2020-16)
Honorable Mayor Arapostathis and City Council:
This law firm represents St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California ("Church") with respect to its appeal of the proposed CityMark Communities LLC (*Applicant") mixed use, State Density Bonus ("SDB"; Gov. § Code § 65915) project on the site of the La Mesa Woman's Club, 5220 Wilson Street ("Project"), and grant of exemption from review under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). This appeal, scheduled to be heard by the City Council ("Council") on October 26, 2021, arises from tainted approvals granted by the City of La Mesa's now-defunct Development Advisory Board ("DAB") - which body the Council disbanded based upon staff's incomplete and dilatory information, and is the subject of ongoing litigation alleging violations of the Ralph M. Brown Act ("Brown Act"; Gov. Code § 54950 et seq.) the City Manager, Community Development Director, and City Attorney have expressly admitted. This correspondence shall serve to further elucidate issues raised in this appeal.

Brown Act Violations

As previously explained in our letter of August 3, 2021, the Church is in litigation with the City regarding Brown Act abuses committed by the DAB - which abuses were not timely, if ever, presented to the Council, and therefore were not cured or corrected in the manner prescribed by law. (Gov. Code § 54960.1.) Notwithstanding claims to the contrary, the record is clear on these basic points:
(1) the DAB is a "legislative a body" subject to the Brown Act. (Gov. Code § 54952(b).);

Hello Megan,

I hope this message finds you well.

In follow-up to the records produced in response to the California Public Records request, dated July 27, 2021,
submitted on behalf of the St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California, there appear to be a number of documents
which were not included. Most are referenced as attachments or links to the responsive public records provided and are listed below so that you may track them down. The list includes:

A. Email attachments:
1. "E:\cp2020\Projects\2020-16 5220 Wilson St\2020-16 Environmental\NOE support to GS AK edits 2021-

6. "E:\cp2021\Presentations\2020-16 Wilson St appeal PC.pptx" (several versions appear to be missing,
including those referenced in the document labeled "RE 5220 Wilson Street, Project No. 2020-16, PC
Presentation Slides.pdf" - an email from Ms. Kinnard to Messrs. Kusiak and Feske); and
7. Comments submitted by Guy Holgren referenced in "Wilson St.pdf" (see email exchange from Mr.
Kusiak to Ms. Kinnard on April 5, 2021 at 2:43pm).
B. In the public records labeled as "RE_ Tinkov follow up - FW_ Partial response - UPDATE _1.pdf" and "RE_ Tinkov
follow up - FW_ Partial response - UPDATE _4.pdf" it appears the City claims that the documents pertaining to
historical aspects of the property at 5220 Wilson Street which City Planner Howard Lee transmitted to Joe
Yetter, the broker for the sale of the La Mesa Woman's Club to CityMark, are no longer available. This is potentially problematic as it appears these documents served as the basis for the historical analysis of a
currently development proposal made by CityMark. (Golden Door Properties, LLC v. Superior Court (2020) 53

Hello Megan,

I have downloaded the three files, Items #1, 2, and 7 - thank you.

With respect to items 3 through 6, and part B of the request below, it appears the City may be running afoul of the Golden Door case referenced below. More specifically, Public Resources Code section 21167.6(e)(10) requires the City to retain (for the purpose of being able to prepare an administrative record with respect to the California Environmental
Quality Act):

Any other written materials relevant to the respondent public agency's compliance with this division or to its decision on the merits of the project, including the initial study, any drafts of any environmental document, or portions thereof, that have been released for public review, and copies of studies or other documents relied upon in any environmental document prepared for the project and either made
available to the public during the public review period or included in the respondent public agency's files on the project, and all internal agency communications, including staff notes and memoranda related to the project or to compliance with this division. [Emphasis added.]
Please confirm that Items through 6 and part B of the request below have been destroyed or are otherwise no longer available. If that is not the case, please provide these materials as soon as possible in light of the notice this office received on Friday, October 15, 2021, that the subject project at 5220 Wilson Street will be brought before the City
Council on October 26, 2021.

Hi Megan,

Putting aside our disagreement over the requirements of PRC section 21167.6(e)(10) and the Golden Door case as to Items 3-6, is it the City's position that the historical records responsive part B of the request is also no longer in existence
and not saved in the course of business?

Hollywoodland Specific Plan v City of Los Angeles (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168, 1187; McQueen v Board ofDirectors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1148; Lewis v Seventeenth District Agricultural Association (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 823, 211.)
In light of these facts, the City cannot use a categorical exemption to avoid further analysis of the Project and must proceed to prepare an initial study followed by the preparation of a mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report permitting the public and the City's decisionmakers a thoughtful and reasoned opportunity to examine the totality of the Project and its potential impacts.

III. Conclusion

The City has failed to provide the public with a substantive opportunity to participate in a public forum regarding this Project in light of the inadequate (and with respect to the DAB, non- existent) notice, along with the practical impossibility of petitioning the government with a
fulsome expression of the public's interests and grievances with regard to the development. The sharply limited deadlines needlessly imposed on the public do not comport with the law.
Further, the Project does not comply with the City's General Plan, Zoning Ordinance, the State Density Bonus Law, nor CEQA. In all, this Project must be sent back for significant further revisions and review.

We further note that the church is now engaged in a quiet title action with the LMWC, before the superior court, over the church's driveway to resolve the ownership, possession, and control of this area. Should the court determine that the church is the title owner of the land, the Project's total size will be sharply reduced resulting in a significant reduction in its base density,
current proposal. Moreover, as well as any density bonus which may be afforded to it under the the Project soeks to install a tall retaining wall along this driveway, which will not be permissible upon the church securing explicit title in this land. And, the Project plans show that the church's driveway is being improperly shown as a fire truck access road during times of emergency though it does not offer access to the Project site given the steep slope separating the properties. In light of this, we strongly recommend the City hold back any decision which may result in confusing these issues or bringing the City into the action unnecessarily.

1 We note the DRB and DAB Staff Reports both inaccurately claim that the Project site at 5220 Wilson Street is owned by CityMark. It is, in fact, owned solely by the LMWC according to the church's latest information.

throughout the site's development both before (during demolition) and long past (during construction) the grading operations. The noise from all of this construction will flow unimpeded into the directly adjacent school and playground disrupting hundreds of children's' cducation for what is likely to be a period of one to two years. (3) Hazardous materials disposal during construction. The LMWC building was
constructed prior to the elimination of asbestos-containing materials, lead-based paints, and polychlorinated biphenyls, yet no analysis has been made of these hazards (or methods to mitigate these potential hazards) upon adjacent residents, churchgoers, senior living facility residents, and/or schoolchildren. (4) Hydrology and water quality impacts from the developed Project. The church's experts have analyzed the existing site, and the proposed Project at build-out, and determined that the Project's drainage study inaccurately describes the conditions such that considerably more stormwater is expected to flow onto the church property than
reported. (5) Transportation impacts from construction and the developed Project. These impacts include significant numbers of heavy-haul trucks going through Wilson Street (designated a local collector) interrupting regular traffic and parking along the road, as well as church and school pick-ups and drop-offs, and a failure to follow the current standard in traffic analysis under CEQA, namely a vehicle miles traveled (VMT) analysis pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15064.3. And as indicated above, the analysis indicates the dangers inherent in the intersection at Grossmont Boulevard and
Wilson Street.

But for the Project's hydrology and water quality analyses, the church's expert analyses on the remaining impact categories described above remain the only information in the administrative record such that the City cannot simply overlook the described potentially significant impacts. Neither the Project applicant, nor the City itself, have made any attempt to respond to these expert analyses such that CEQA requires that an initial study be prepared. (Hansen Brothers Enterprises, Inc. V. Board of Supervisors (1996) 12 Cal.4th 533, 560 [standing for the proposition that undisputed evidence in the administrative record must be relied upon.].) Until such time as the Project applicant, or the City, rebut the evidence presented by the church's experts, and with respect to certain issues, the testimony, and opinions of laypersons, those remain the only materials upon which the City may rely in determining whether the exemption to CEQA under Guidelines section 15332 may be effective.
Under CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(c), "[a] categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is reasonable possibility that the activity will have significant effect
on the environment due to unusual circumstances." Such an exception to CEQA Guidelines section
15332 exists in the administrative record in light of church's undisputed expert testimony as to impact categories described above. The City may not ignore evidence of an unusual circumstance creating a reasonable possibility of a significant environmental impact. (Committee to Save the

A. The City May Not Apply The In-Fill Development Exemption In Light Of The Project's Expected, and Known, Potentially Significant Impacts
The City proposes to avoid CEQA review of the Project by employing the In-Fill Development exemption found at CEQA Guidelines section 15332. This exemption provides that in-fill development may avoid CEQA analysis if:

(a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations.
(b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses. (c) The project site has no value as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened
species. (d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality. (e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.
Our client has secured all Project materials the City purports to have in its possession or control via the California Public Records Act ("CPRA"). In securing this data, it has becomc readily obvious that very little analysis of the Project's potentially significant impacts to the environment have been performed to date. In fact, the only data in the administrative record analyzing the Project under CEQA has been provided by our client's environmental experts. These
analyses, and the records produced pursuant to the above-mentioned CPRA request, indicate that though CityMark submitted an "Environmental Assessment/Initial Study Application" the City has performed no analysis of its own and has no Initial Study to indicate whether further environmental review must occur. Morcover, the expert analyses provided by our client, concretely and definitively specifies potentially significant impacts in the following CEQA categories:

(1) Air quality impacts arising from construction. This is especially important in that the Project proposes significant grading - "400 cubic yards of excavation (cut) and 1,400 cubic yards of fill... primarily used to raise the rear of the site to establish a pad for the parking area [along with]... [a] retaining wall of up to eight and a half feet in height is planned along the south end of the parking area" - which is directly adjacent to the area where 125 students currently attend the Warren Walker School, on the church campus. These students are sensitive receptors, spending time outdoors to learn and play, and with open windows, especially during the COVID-19 era, to provide additional ventilation limiting disease spread. (2) Noise impact arising from construction. Again, much like the air impacts category, directly above, but likely to last significantly longer as the construction noise will exist

While the Guidelines provide opportunities for projects to be exempted from CEQA review, these exemptions are limited in nature. "Only those projects having no significant effect on the onvironment are categorically exempt from CEQA review." (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network, supra, at p. 1102.) A significant effect is a "substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in the environment." (Pub. Res. Code §21068. [Emphasis added.]) This means that an activity has a significant effect if, among other things, it "has the potential to degrade the quality of the environment." (Pub. Res. Code & 21083.) "[A]n activity that may have a significant effect on the environment cannot be categorically exempt." (Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish & Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 124. [Emphasis added.])
The courts review categorical exemptions using strict construction in a manner affording the greatest environmental protection within the reasonable scope of the statutory language. (County of Amador v. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 966.) "[E]xemption categories are not to be expanded or broadened beyond the reasonable scope of their statutory language." (Dehne v. County of Santa Clara (1981) 115 Cal.App.3d 827, 842.) Thus, an exemption must be applicable in light of the full scope of a project.
A public agency has the burden of proving that substantial evidence supports its factual finding that a project falls within the asserted exemption. (Davidon Homes v. City of San Jose, 54 Cal. App. 4th 106, 114-115 (1997); Magan v. County of Kings (2002) 105 Cal.App.4th 468, 475.) "An agency's duty to provide such factual support 'is all the more important where the record shows ...that opponents of the project have raised arguments regarding possible significant environmental impacts."* (Muzzy Ranch Co. v. Solano County Airport Land Use Com. (2007) 41 Cal.4th 372, 386.) A city cannot impose burden on the public to prove a possibility of adverse environmental impacts since this would frustrate CEQA's fundamental purpose of ensuring that government officials "make decisions with environmental consequences in mind." (Davidon Homes, supra, at p. 116; California Farm Bureau Federation v. California Wildlife Conservation Bd. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173, 186.) "[T]he agency's exemption determination must be supported by evidence in the record demonstrating that the agency considered possible environmental impacts in reaching its decision."(Davidon Homes, supra, at p. 117; East Peninsula Ed. Council, Inc. v. Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School Dist. (1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 155, 171.)
The record before the City, limited as it is because of the lack of analysis performed by CityMark, reveals that the Project's potential effects on the environment make the application of a categorical exemption legally inappropriate. In fact, most of the environmental analysis performed, to date, has been by the church's experts and those analysis have not been challenged, nor apparently analyzed by the City.

which has been in place for over half a century and, thus, conflicts directly and inarguably with this policy.
6) Objective UD-3.1 requires that development be "architecturally and environmentally sensitive and ..compatible with neighboring design and scale." As indicated in the discussions regarding Policy LU-1.2.2 and Policy LU-2.1.2 directly above, the Project is unlike anything in this neighborhood, especially with respect to its design and scale, and therefore, conflicts with this objective of the General Plan.
In short, the Project cannot be said to be in harmony with the City's General Plan Land Use and Urban Design Element as proposed. As such, it must be revised significantly to come into conformance with the General Plan, and the surrounding community.

II. The Project Fails To Comply With The California Environmental Quality Act
The primary purposes of CEQA are to inform City decisionmakers, as well as the public, about the potential impacts of a project, and to prescribe mitigation measures to avoid such impacts. CEQA requires a broad view of what constitutes a project requiring environmental analysis. (McQueen v. Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1143.) Even projects that appear benign will likely fall within the ambit of CEQA. (Bloom v. McGurk (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1307, 1312.) The California State Legislature formulated CEQA to "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of the environment shall be the guiding criterion in public decisions." (Pub. Res. Code §21001(d).) To implement this goal, CEQA requires municipalities to analyze discretionary projects for potential environmental impacts utilizing a three-tier system. (No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 74.) The first tier is known as a preliminary review. The preliminary review requires public agency staff to analyze a complete application in order to discern the full scope of the project at issuo. (CEQA Guidelines section 15060(b); City of Pasadena V. The State of California (1993) 14 Cal.App.4th 810, 836.) Once the parameters of the project are established, a determination is made to resolve whether an exemption is applicable to the project. If such an exemption is found, the agency must determine that no exceptions to the exemption are triggered by the potential impacts from the full scope of the project. (CEQA Guidelines §§ 15060, 15061.) If the project is not exempt from CEQA, or an exception is applicable, the second tier of review is required wherein an initial study is prepared because it has a been determined that there is a possibility that the project may have a significant effect on the environment. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063.) An initial study facilitates environmental assessment early in the design of a project. (CEQA Guidelines § 15063(c).) In the third tier, the initial study is used to demonstrate that either: a) the project "will not have a significant effect," triggering the preparation of a negative declaration, or b) the project is one "which may have a significant effect on the environment," triggering the preparation of an environmental impact report ("EIR"). (CEQA Guidelines § 15064.)

clements." (Resource Defense Fund v. County of Santa Cruz (1982) 133 Cal.App.3rd 800, 806.) CEQA imposes an obligation on La Mesa to assess the Project's consistency with the City's General Plan. (North Coast Rivers Alliance et al. V. Marin Municipal Water District (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 614, 633.) The Project, as designed and proposed, cannot be found to be consistent with the Land Use and Urban Design Element of the City's General Plan.

By way of example:

1) Policy LU-1.2.2 requires that "[a]s part of the development review process, City departments will review all future development to ensure that safety requirements are met, including building and fire codes, accessibility standards and crime prevention techniques. Yet, as indicated above, the City's failure to ensure that the intersection of Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street indicates that no such review has been performed (or that, if it has, the requirement to ensure safety has been obviated) such that a dangerous condition not only is permitted to exist, but it is being worsened by increasing the vehicular and pedestrian traffic in the area while also attempting to authorize a large development where a single-story structure currently exists, further reducing sight lines on a dangerous curve in the road. Similarly, the proposed waivers to reduce parking space dimensions and drive aisle widths do not "ensure that safety requirements are met, including building and fire codes, [nor] accessibility standards."
2) Policy LU-2.1.2 requires the City to "[s]upport infill development and subdivision proposals that reinforce neighborhood strengths and benefit neighborhood identity," yet the Project proposes a development which is so different in character and intensity from any other in the neighborhood, both with respect to its architectural style and the materials used on its exterior walls - none of which can be found elsewhere in this community. Thus, it cannot be said that this Project will "reinforce" the existing visual appeal of the community.
3) Policy LU-2.1.5 requires the implementation of projects in the "Mixed-Use Overlay Zone by promoting the rehabilitation of properties and new development that fits into the context of the existing neighborhoods while meeting the City's Urban Design Objectives for infill development." Again, as noted directly above, in #2, the Project is completely out of character and context with respect to the existing neighborhood such that this policy cannot be met. 4) Policy LU-4.2.3 requires that "[n]ew development shall provide adequate
parking. As the Project specifically seeks to not only reduce parking space numbers below the City's normal standards, it also seeks to reduce the number below those permitted under the State Density Bonus Law (albeit, improperly attempting to do so via a waiver, as indicated in the immediately preceding two sections of this letter). Also, as indicated in the immediately preceding section, the Project does not provide adequate parking not only with respect to the reduced number of spaces it proposes, but also improperly attempts to reduce the dimensions of the spaces and the drive aisles around them in a manner likely to impact the public's (and future residents') health and safety. Thus, the Project clearly conflicts with this policy as well. 5) Objective UD-1.1 requires the City's "It]o protect La Mesa's existing built environment and cultural heritage." But the Project proposes to destroy the LMWC clubhouse

B. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Not Permitted To Overcome Regulations That Pertain To Health And Safety
As mentioned above, the Project's requests for waivers are inapposite to the law because they pertain to financial rather than physical constraints. In addition, the Project
improperly seeks to waive the City's standard parking space and driving aisle dimensions even though this would result in direct health and safety impacts. Waivers are impermissible on this basis as well.

The dimensions of parking spaces and adjacent driving aisles are specified to ensure the safety of vehicles, their drivers and passengers, and pedestrians. (LMMC § 22.112.010(B).) This makes common sense - if spaces and driving aisles are too small, or otherwise constrained, they are likelier to lead to physical harm from other vehicles when vacating or entering a space and are the reason why State building codes requires minimum parking dimensions to ensure health and safety. (DAB Staff Report, p. 3 & Attachment D, pp. 3-4; DRB Staff Report, p. 3 & Attachment E, pp. 3-4.)
Government Code section 65915(e)(1) of the State Density Bonus Law provides:
Nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted to require a local government to waive or reduce development standards if the waiver or reduction would have a specific, adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5, upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact. [Emphasis added.]
Thus, a waiver cannot be used to avoid the specific, adverse impact arising from the reduction of a basic safety feature inherent in parking stall/space sizes and driving aisle dimensions as contemplated by the Project due to the health and safety issues it raises. No justification exists which would be sufficient to overcome this requested reduction in health and safety standards, nor would an incentive permit such a thing.
C. The Project, As Designed, Is Contrary To The Chief Land Use Policies Declared Under The Land Use And Urban Design Element Of The Gencral Plan
California law requires each city and county to adopt a general plan, a comprehensive long- term plan for the development of that city or county, famously referred to by the state Supreme Court as the "constitution for future development." (Lesher Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 540.) A general plan must contain seven mandatory "elements," including a "land use element" to designate the level of intensity and general distribution of land uses. (Gov. Code § 65302.) "[T]he propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development depends upon [a finding of] consistency with the applicable general plan and its

PWM775

Pursuant to Government Code §65915(e)(1), waivers (as opposed to incentives) are afforded to a density bonus project only when "development standard will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a development," not because the developer desires it, or it because it will enhance the financial prospects of a project. Put another way, a waiver permits deviation from, or altogcther evasion of, regulations which affect a project due to its site-specific physical features. This subject site has no such physical constraints. Rather, the balconies could be built outside of the pedestrian realm (i.e., within the building envelope) by moving the exterior walls along Grossmont Boulevard back four feet, or removed altogether. The applicant itself makes clear that it is not a physical constraint that drives this waiver request when it states its justification as follows:
This waiver is requested due to excessive space and cost impacts to incorporate the Open Space requirement and private balconies. The loss of development potential to incorporate this would make the project infeasible to provide the affordable units.
As mentioned above, the site itself does not have any physical obstruction which precludes construction of these balconies, rather CityMark simply desires to have them overhang the pedestrian realm because it would it increase their financial incentive to develop the Project. The State Density Bonus Law permits this sort of deviation from regulation for financial gain through the use of incentives, of which the Project has two (waivers, on the other hand, are unlimited for such developments). Yet, the Project avoids using any of its incentives and instead improperly
requests at least five waivers to avoid its open space requirements, building height limit, parking space sizing, landscaping required within the pedestrian realm, and overall parking requirements. In each such instance, CityMark indicates that the justification for the waiver is not a physical constraint unique to the site but rather the request is made to seek a financial boon for the
developer.
The reason the Project seeks to use waivers rather than incentives is clear on its face - the State Density Bonus Law does not authorize a sufficient number of incentives (i.e., the Project requires five, but only has two available to it) to meet CityMark's desired financial goals, whereas it may request an unlimited number of waivers. Because it does not have sufficient incentives to develop the Project in this manner, it attempts to avoid their use altogether and instead make faulty justifications for waivers which are impermissible under the law.
Because CityMark cannot show a physical constraint exists which limits the development of the Project under the City's laws and policies, it must use its incentives (and justify the use of those incentives by showing the financial benefit gained thereby) and/or redesign the Project to be in conformity with the law.

§ 24.18.040(B).) The condition to pay a fee in lieu of an actual mitigation measure regarding a known project impact runs afoul of CEQA and should not be permitted. Rather the Project must be required to perform an analysis to determine the scope of the impact and to then propose a mitigation measure to reduce that impact to a less than significant level.
Moreover, this mitigation measure is improper on two other bases. First, it improperly attempts to defer mitigation until a later (and, in this case, unknown future) time. This is specifically forbidden under CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4 (a)(1)(B).) And second, a mitigation measure is only available if a project under CEQA is expected to generate a potentially significant impact on the environment, but the staff report indicates that the Project is exempt from CEQA because there are no such expected impacts. (DAB Staff Report, p. 7-8; see also DAB Staff Report, Attachment A, "Resolution No. DAB-2021-xx" at Par. 1.) So, either the Project is not exempt from CEQA and cannot be conditioned to mitigate a potentially significant impact, or it must be analyzed properly under CEQA (i.e., by preparation of an Initial Study, followed by specific impact category studies, and the development of a mitigated negative declaration or an environmental impact report). The status quo does not comport with the law. (Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1102 [a public agency may not adopt mitigation measures for a project for the purpose of qualifying it for a categorical CEQA exemption; see also Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1200.)
A. State Density Bonus Waivers Are Limited To Overcoming Physical, Not Financial, Constraints Such That Avoiding Improvements To The Pedestrian Realm Are Not
Permitted For This Project
As indicated above, the Project is designated Mixed Use Urban requiring improvements to the surrounding pedestrian realm. LMMC § 24.18.020(E) defines the term "pedestrian realm" as follows:

"Pedestrian realm" means a twelve-foot wide area located between the face of the
curb of a Circulation Element designated street and the face of the building. The pedestrian realm includes the parkway, sidewalk, and landscaped areas. The pedestrian realm may include both public and private property where the public right-of-way is not twelve fect wide. Pedestrian amenities, street trees, street furniture, bus stop facilities, and other landscaping, as specified in this chapter, shall be included in the public realm.
Notwithstanding this acknowledged requirement, "[w]aivers are being requested to allow reductions in... pedestrian realm requirements." (DAB Staff Report, p. 3; DRB Staff Report, p. 3.) For instance, the Project sccks a "waiver" under the State Density Bonus Law so that it may encroach four feet into the pedestrian realm along Grossmont Boulevard by installing balconies hanging over this right of way. This miscomprehends what a waiver is under the law.

The Project sits under 100 feet away, directly across Grossmont Boulevard, from the Grossmont Shopping Center. The closest supermarket to the Project is the Walmart Neighborhood Market therein, lying approximately 350 fcet away, yet because there is no crosswalk, stop sign, and/or traffic signal at the intersection of Wilson Street and Grossmont Boulevard, a resident of the Project would be required to walk about three-quarters of a mile to safely cross the street, pick up groceries, and return with them it is doubtful many residents will be able to lug an average family's weekly groceries this distance, on foot. (DAB Staff Report, p. 2 [In fact, the City recognizes this failing at the beginning of its report, "The intersection is not signalized and is lacking curb ramps and crosswalks."]; see also DRB Staff Report at p. 2 for the same
acknowledgment of a dangerous condition].) Notwithstanding this, it appears the Project is being permitted to avoid the development of a crosswalk which is absolutely necessary for its residents
or, at least, providing an analysis showing the Project will generate significantly more average daily vehicular trips and vehicle miles traveled than contemplated.
The City failed to require a traffic analysis for the Project, though it initially sought to require an ADA-compliant ramp be constructed at this intersection before apparently dropping this condition altogether. Our client's environmental consultant has also indicated this intersection is particularly dangerous because of limited sightlines arising from a substantial curve in Grossmont Boulevard in this arca. The observation that this particular intersection is dangerous has been voiced numerous times in correspondence submitted to the City by multiple parties. Yet the staff reports show that no ramp, crosswalk, or analysis was required of the Project - instead, the Project is conditioned to provide $5,000 "fair-share" payment toward a ramp to be built by an unknown party at an unknown time in the future. This does not comport with the law.
There appears to be no plan on file to develop a safe intersection at Grossmont Boulevard and Wilson Street, and the $5,000 payment does not appear to go towards any previously approved fund for that purpose. Nor is there any indication of how this figure was calculated. In Anderson First Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1173, the appellate court held that paying a "fair-share fee" is permissible as effective mitigation only if the fees are "part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency commits itself to implementing." That is not the case in this instance. In light of this, the City must require the installation of an appropriately signalized intersection, or some other traffic calming feature here, or require the Project to present an analysis indicating why it should not do so. The only evidence in the administrative record, to date, on this topic shows that the City initially desired a crosswalk to be installed but backed off without explanation (or analysis available to the public, or the City's
decisionmakers).
"Tn MU areas, new development is required to include pedestrian realm improvements along collector streets to encourage pedestrian activity. The Circulation Element classifies Grossmont Boulevard as a major collector street subject to pedestrian realm requirements.' (DAB Staff Report, p. 2; DRB Staff Report, p. 2. [Emphasis added.]; see also La Mesa Municipal Code

in light of California Executive Order N-29-20. Yet, the failure to afford the public a practical a opportunity to review, analyze, and respond to the Project's 137-page DRB staff report and the 150-page DAB staff report does not comport with the public's statutory and constitutional rights to petition its government under the Ralph M. Brown Act. (Government Code 54950 et seq.; Cal. Const.., Art. I § 3, subd. (a) and (b)(1), (7).) These actions run afoul of the law as they present limitations on public participation which are simply "too arbitrary and capricious, too restrictive and unreasonable." (Nevens V. Chino (1965) 233 Cal.App.2d 775, 778; see also Robins v. Pruneyard Shopping Center (1979) 23 Cal.3d 899, 907 The right of the people to petition the government for redress of grievances is "vital to a scheme."].) basic process in the state's constitutional

Furthermore, should CityMark, or its consultants, be permitted to present audio/visual materials to, or communicate directly with, the DAB or DRB boards during these hearings on March 8, 2021 it will only heighten the inequities inherent in providing late, or no, notice to the public, with regard to the respective rights of the parties to petition their government. This would be an unfortunate, and likely unlawful, action in unequal treatment under both state and federal
statutes and constitutions. A more reasoned action would be to postpone each of the DAB and DRB hearings by a week, or more, to permit each party, and the public more generally, an opportunity to present their positions thoughtfully,
Notwithstanding this, we offer limited summary of our client's position with respect to the proposed Project in the hopes that it will be presented to the DAB and DRB board members for review prior to any discussion of, or determination on, this matter. In light of the severely constrained time available to us before the DAB and DRB meetings, we will not reiterate each of
the points made in prior communications and correspondence delivered to the City in opposition to the Project but join in those comments by this reference. Rather, we will focus briefly on the inadequate analysis of the Project in light of the City's General Plan and Zoning Ordinance, the Project's inapt use of California State Density Bonus Law (Gov. Code § 65915 et seq.) waivers, and the impropriety of the claimed CEQA exemption under Guidelines section 15332.

I. The Project Runs Afoul Of The General Plan's Urban Design Element And The
Zoning Ordinance

As the staff reports to each of the DAB and DRB indicate, the Project site is designated as "Mixed Use Urban," corresponding to the Mixed Use (MU) Overlay, in the Residential Business base zone and is intended to support "pedestrian friendly housing.' (DAB Staff Report, p. 2; DRB Staff Report, p.2.) Notwithstanding this, the Project seeks to avoid the very fcatures it is obligated to provide to enable pedestrian-friendly housing.

Re: Project No. 2020-16 (CityMark Communities LLC) - 5220 Wilson Street, La Mesa, CA

Dear Ms. Kinnard:

This law firm represents the St. Luke's Lutheran Church, La Mesa, California located at 5150 Wilson Street, directly adjacent to the La Mesa Woman's Club ("LMWC"), the site of a 49 residential unit and three commercial unit mixed-use project ("Project") proposed by CityMark Communities LLC ("CityMark") known as Project No. 2020-16. This correspondence is offered to inform the City of La Mesa ("City") of our client's grave concerns regarding the proposed Project, the limited conditions recommended to ensure the health and safety of the public, and the apparent lack of analysis of the Project's expected impacts.
We also wish to bring to the City's attention that on December 17, 2020 this firm requested to be placed on the notice list for all public hearings relating to the Project, and specifically those relating to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Notwithstanding this, we were only sent notice of the March 8, 2021, 12:30 p.m. Design Review Board ("DRB") meeting after regular work hours, at 8:10 p.m., on Thursday, March 4, 2021 4, (see Attachment "1*), indicating that the City requires audio/visual presentations by the public to be submitted by "12:00 noon, one business day prior to the start of the meeting." It would be practically impossible to prepare and transmit any presentation, let alone thoughtful one, within three regular working hours of receipt of said notice (i.e., after 9 a.m. on March 5, 2021) to comply with the City's stated deadline. What is more, no notice was sent to this office of the March 8, 2021, 10 a.m. Development Advisory Board ("DAB") meeting though we understand that an exemption to CEQA analysis is to be voted on in this hearing. In fact, it is solely due to our client's diligence in searching the City's website, at approximately 11:15 am on March 5, 2021, that we learned of the DAB meeting at all - again, making it impossible to provide the City with an audio/visual presentation by the 12:00 noon deadline set for that same day.
We understand that COVID-19 has altered the conditions by which we all live and work, and that the City is permitted to avoid direct communications from the public during such hearings

Automobile storage of in new vehicles is allowed in the C zone for a limited duration a of 18
months with approval of a conditional use permit. The property is currently zoned RB-D-MU. While the base RB zone does not allow these uses, the MU overlay does allow a car sales use on the property with approval of a conditional use permit in a mixed-use development, but

Sales: Car sales could be allowed in a mixed-use development with approval of a conditional

Kerry,
The La Mesa Women's Club site is zoned RB, which does allow, by
CUP, parking as an accessory use to adjacent/across the street
commercial uses. With a use permit, the project would be subject to
CEQA. Although additional research is needed, it does appear likely
that there would be cultural resource impacts. This could prove
problematic as demolition is generally not mitigable under CEQA.
According to Images of America: La Mesa (Newland, 2010), the La
Mesa Women's Club is the oldest community civic organization in La
Mesa, formed in 1902. The building has served as the group's
headquarters since 1959. The architect, Herluf Brydegaard, designed
a number of notable midcentury civic and commercial buildings,
some in collaboration with Lloyd Ruocco. The Women's Club building
maintains its original integrity and would likely be eligible as a
historic landmark under multiple criteria.

If project includes building demo, environmental review will add some time -
probably 6-9 months total processing time.

Kerry,
The broker has advised Roger Penske that the demo permit requires a site plan, storm water info,
and utility service termination proof.
What level of detail is required for the site plan?
At what point does proof of termination need to be required? Can the permit be issued prior to proof of termination? They would like to allow the Women's Club to continue to operate for as long
as feasible.
Is there anything else required for the permit?

Roger,
I just left you a voicemail, but l thought would email this information to you.
The lot is zoned RB-D-MU (residential business-urban design overlay-mixed use overlay)
You had expressed interest in purchasing the parcel and using it for employee parking.
In reviewing the municipal code for zoning:
(RB Zoning) Section 24.05.020 C.1. Accessory parking to an adjacent business may be permitted if the business is either adjacent to or
on the opposite side of the street with a Conditional Use Permit. Therefore, you could use this parcel as an employee parking lot if you obtained a Conditional Use
Permit.
Conditional Use Permits are approved by the planning commission. Properties within 300 feet of the
proposed use would be notified during the process.
(MU Overlay) Section 24.18.030 Requires a Conditional Use Permit for parking lots within the mixed use overlay zone. Also, the mixed use overlay zone requires a 12-foot pedestrian realm (sidewalk and landscaping setback) along the
street frontage of the property. The pedestrian zone may have to be constructed.
The same Conditional Use Permit above would be used to satisfy this requirement.
Parking (24.04.040)
If this parking lot will be used to satisfy the "required" parking for your employees then there needs
a to be a traversable pedestrian route within 300 feet.
I am not sure that this parking lot is "required" at this point. The building at 5220 Wilson Street appears to be 50 years old and may have historical significance. It has been the home of the La Mesa Women's Club and may have been designed by a notable architect. Therefore, you will likely need to conduct a cultural resources study and potentially an
Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the building if you intend to demolish it. If you intent to demo the building you may have to demonstrate that there are environmental "overriding considerations"
that require the building to be demolished.
Please email or call with questions. Thank you.
I hope the rain holds off on Sunday!
