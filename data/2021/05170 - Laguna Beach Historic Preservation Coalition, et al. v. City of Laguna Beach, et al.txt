Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 Petitioners allege:

2 Introduction

3 1. The Laguna Beach Historic Preservation Coalition, Preserve Orange
4 County, and Village Laguna bring this mandamus action in the public interest.
5

6 They challenge the city's amendment of its Historic Preservation Program without
complying with mandates of state environmental law.

8 Bowing to property-owners' demands to alter or replace historic buildings

9 with those of ever-greater mass and scale, the city has decreed owner consent as the
10 prerequisite to identifying and protecting local historic resources. Such consent is
11

12 irrelevant to historic merit, and now hundreds of city-identified historic resources rich

13 with California character will be newly at risk of substantial alteration or demolition.

14

15

16

17

18

19

20

21

22

23

24 The City Council's actions were both short-sighted and unlawful. The California
25 Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) protects the historic "built" environment to the
26

27 same extent as the state's natural resources such as air, water, and forests. Indeed,

28 as a matter of law CEQA projects that substantially impact historic resources will have

Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 significant environmental impacts. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21084.1.) CEQA does not

2 allow an agency to approve such impactful projects without an environmental impact
3 report (EIR) process to analyze mitigations and alternatives.
4

5 Here, the city refused to prepare an EIR before, inter alia, it amended the Historic

6 Resources Element of the Laguna Beach General Plan and took implementing actions

7 to reduce historic resource protections via a newly "voluntary" Historic Preservation

8 Program. Absent relief from this Court, consequences will be grave. Property owners
9

10 with plans to clear valuable coastal lots for new buildings are likely to oppose rather

11 than consent to historic status despite the unique historic value of existing buildings.

12 Deserving properties will not be identified and owners will not be required to explore

13 options for the feasible, cost-effective expansion and restoration of historic homes.
14

15 Instead, buildings will be remodeled or demolished without consideration of their

16 historic qualities. Laguna's Historic Preservation Program will thereby facilitate

17 needless, irreversible damage to its charming beachtown character and historic legacy.

18 CEQA is citizen-enforced. The Laguna Beach Historic Preservation Coalition,
19

20 Preserve Orange County, and Village Laguna therefore seek this Court's judgment and

21 peremptory writ. Under the low-threshold 'fair argument' standard of review, the City

22 Council's discretion to consider a and codify a voluntary preservation program must be

23 informed by EIR analysis and adoption of feasible mitigations and alternatives.

24 Judgment is urgently and respectfully requested to set aside the city's approval 25

26 of the revised Historic Preservation Program pending CEQA compliance. An EIR

27 process must precede program revision, consideration, approval, or implementation.

28 Petitioners challenge all of the city's actions taken to approve the program. While some

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 2

1 approvals also require California Coastal Commission approval by statute or

2. regulation, the city's revision of the Historic Resources Element does not.

3

4 Jurisdiction

5
2. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code section 21168.5
6

7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. The parties and affected historic resources lie

8 within the City of Laguna Beach and the County of Orange.

9

10 Parties

11 3. Petitioner Laguna Beach Historic Preservation Coalition is an
12

13 unincorporated association formed in the public interest before the city's approvals of

14 the revised Historic Preservation Program. Its mission is to preserve and protect the

15 historic fabric of Laguna Beach. Association members enjoy and appreciate the city's

16 historic resources. The association brings this petition on behalf of all others similarly
17

18 situated and too numerous to be named and brought before this Court as petitioners.

19 The association and its members objected to the city's approvals of the general plan
20 amendments and related actions to further the revised Historic Preservation Program,

21 and exhausted their administrative remedies.

22 4. Petitioner Preserve Orange County is a California non-profit public benefit
23

24 corporation founded in 2016 by a group of residents to promote conservation of Orange

25 County's architectural and cultural heritage. Its members enjoy and appreciate historic

26 resources in Laguna Beach and believe that historic resources are essential to

27 maintaining and improving livability, diversity, sustainability, and economic vitality.
28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 3

1 The corporation brings this petition on behalf of all others similarly situated and too

2 numerous to be named and brought before this Court as petitioners. It objected to the

3 city's approvals of the general plan amendments and revised Historic Preservation
4

5 Program and exhausted administrative remedies.

6 5. Petitioner Village Laguna is a California non-profit corporation formed in

7 1971. Among its primary goals is the preservation of the unique village character of

8 Laguna Beach, recognizing and celebrating the city's historic and cultural heritage, and
9

10 preserving the character of the downtown and distinctive neighborhoods that residents

11 and Village Laguna supporters appreciate and enjoy. The corporation brings this

12 petition on behalf of others similarly situated too numerous to be named and brought

13 before this Court. It objected to the city's approvals of the general plan amendments
14

15 and Historic Preservation Program and exhausted administrative remedies.

16 6. Respondents City of Laguna Beach and its City Council (collectively, the

17 city) is the governmental body that made first approvals of the Historic Preservation

18 Program, including a general plan amendment and related implementing actions. It is
19 the lead agency responsible for CEQA compliance on matters within its jurisdiction.
20

21 7. A copy of this petition has been mailed to the California Attorney General.

22

23 General Allegations

24 8. The paragraphs below refer to and rely on information in documents that

25 will be lodged with this Court as part of the record of proceedings.

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 4

1 Environmental Setting

2 9. The National Park Service recognizes and honors the entirety of Laguna
Beach, including its built a environment, as a Historic American Landscape. "A Short
4
History of Laguna Beach" by historian Karen Turnbull, reprinted within the Historic

6 Resources Element of the Laguna Beach General Plan, explains:

7 "The fact that the railroad never had tracks to Laguna Beach and that, still

8 today, only two roads lead in and out of the city, has caused Laguna to remain a
somewhat isolated and self-contained village. The village quality has continued
10 to be perpetuated particularly through the local architecture. Today Laguna

11 Beach contains a myriad of residential and commercial building styles all with

12 the mark of charm and individuality that has been popular in the city through

13 the decades. Many of these one-of-a-kind houses are simply referred to as the

14 Eclectic style. The individuality of existing (or newer) homes in Laguna resulted

15 from the general lack of large tract development. Most houses built in Laguna

16 were designed and built one at a time. The result is a very diverse collection of

17 architecture without large concentrations of one particular style found in other
South Orange County communities.
18 The older homes and buildings in the city form both an important part of
19 the local history and serve as an important setting component of the quality
20 and character of Laguna Beach. For this reason, it is important that the City of
21 Laguna Beach implement programs which protect and prolong the life of these
22 older buildings."

23
10.
24 Primary architectural styles that characterize Laguna's environmental

25 setting are Craftsman (circa 1910-1930), Bungalow (circa 1900-1930), Beach Cottage

26 (circa 1910-1940), Period Revival (circa 1928-1940), Moderne (circa 1930-1940), and

27 Eclectic (circa 1915-1940). Laguna also has a notable trove of Mid-century Modern
28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 5

1 buildings (circa 1940-1969).

2 11. As explained by the city's Heritage Committee: "The streetscape of older
3 Laguna is changing in terms of size, scale, and character of housing ... Escalating land
4

5 values discourage rehabilitation and encourage demolition of older structures

6 changing the density and the character of neighborhoods ... There is a lack of

7 knowledge of compatible rehabilitation techniques and approaches."

8

9 Project Description

10 12. The revised Historic Preservation Program is a project that as described by 11

12 city staff includes General Plan Amendment 19-5414, Zoning Ordinance Amendment

13 17-0289, and Local Coastal Program Amendment 17-0388 "to provide for a local

14 voluntary preservation program" and revised historic incentives for properties listed
15 in the Laguna Beach Historic Register.
16

17 Administrative Process and Approval
18
13.
19 The city's controversial update of its Historic Preservation Program spans

20 years of public meetings, workshops, and task force meetings involving the public and

21 city boards and commissions.

22 14. In October 2018 the City Council directed staff to proceed with
23

24 environmental review for a "voluntary" preservation program. The city conducted

25 CEQA analysis for the program /project including proposed General Plan Amendment

26 19-5414 to the Historic Resources Element, Zoning Ordinance Amendment 17-0289,

27 and Local Coastal Program Amendment 17-0388. An Initial Study / Negative
28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 6

1 Declaration was circulated for public comment for 30 days, beginning in January 2020.

2 15. In late February 2020, the city's Planning Commission conducted a public

3 hearing and voted to recommend that the City Council adopt the proposed
4

5 amendments to the Municipal Code and approve the Negative Declaration.

6 16. On July 14, 2020, the City Council conducted a public hearing at which the

7 public raised objections to the reductions in protections to historic resources being

8 considered by the city, as also presented in detailed written comments. The Council
9

10 approved a resolution that adopted the Negative Declaration and introduced Zoning

11 Ordinance Amendment 17-0289. The Ordinance proceeded to a second reading on

12 August 11, 2020. On that date, following an additional public hearing, the Council

13 approved amendments to the Historic Resources Element and amendments to the

14

15 Laguna Beach Residential Design Guidelines and Local Coastal Program.

16 17. California Coastal Commission review and consideration for approvals

17 are pending for the City Council's above-referenced and approved amendments to the

18 Zoning Ordinance, Design Guidelines, and Local Coastal Program.
19
18. The City Council had sole authority to approve amendments to the
20

21 Historic Resources Element of the General Plan. As part of its final discretionary

22 approval, the Council in August 2020 chose to impose a condition not required by

23 statute or regulation, that said revisions would "not become effective until and unless
24 the Coastal Commission certifies [Local Coastal Program Amendment] 17-0388."
25
19.
26 The city did not file a Notice of Determination following its approval

27 actions relating to the revised Historic Preservation Program on July 14 and August 11

28 2020. This petition is timely-filed within 180 days of the approvals.

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 7

1 20. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary

2 course of law. Issuance of a peremptory writ is imperative to avoid irreparable harm to
3 Laguna Beach residents and the city's environment via implementation of the 4

5 voluntary Historic Preservation Program without compliance with law. The city has

6 the capacity to correct its violations of law but has failed and refused to do so.

7

B Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act

9 21. Petitioners incorporate all paragraphs as if fully set forth.
10
22. CEQA requires agencies to conduct a prescribed, public EIR process 11

12 before taking actions that may have any significant adverse environmental impacts.

13 The process both informs the public and provides necessary information to allow

14 elected officials and decisionmakers to comply with CEQA's substantive mandate:
15 the adoption of feasible project mitigations and alternatives that can reduce a project's 16

17 significant environmental impacts.

18 23. The city abused its discretion and failed to act in the manner required by

19 law in approving the Historic Preservation Program based on the Initial Study/
20 Negative Declaration, without adopting feasible mitigation measures and alternatives. 21

22 According to proof upon certification of the administrative record:

23 a. The city unlawfully approved a project with potentially significant

24 environmental impacts without preparing an EIR to inform its discretion. The record
25 contains substantial evidence supporting a fair argument of potentially significant
26

27 environmental impacts of the new voluntary Historic Preservation Program. Among

28 other impacts that may be supported by evidence in the record of proceedings,

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 8

1 potentially significant impacts will be caused by, inter alia:

2 Reduction of city protections to historic resources by requiring that
3 property-owners must consent to any identification of a resource as

4

5 eligible for listing in the Local Historic Register or as otherwise historic,

6 unmoored from facts and expert evaluation. Owner consent is not a valid

7 criterion for identifying historic merit or status subject to CEQA.

8 Narrowing of the definitions of historic resources entitled to protection.
9

10 Removal of historic status of properties listed on the city's 1981 Inventory.

11 Elimination of current requirements for historic assessments of properties
12 identified in the Historic Resources Element before allowing alterations,
13

14 remodels, or demolitions.

15 Elimination of current city protections for Appendix F, the State Historic

16 Preservation Officer CHRIS Historic Properties Data File.

17

18 Aesthetic impacts to scenic vistas and public views of unique and/ or

19 architecturally significant vintage or historic structures.

20 b. The city failed to provide copies of the proposed amendments to the

21 general plan available as an appendix to the Initial Study /Negative Declaration, and
22

23 failed to study the 'whole of the action.'

24 C. Regardless of whether the city has final approval of all aspects of the

25 Historic Preservation Program, including amendments to the Laguna Beach Residential

26 Design Guidelines and Local Coastal Program Amendment, in making the first
27 approvals including amendments to the Historic Resources Element of the Laguna
28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 9

1 Beach General Plan, which is not part of the Local Coastal Program, the city failed to

2 comply with CEQA as to the whole of the action subject to an EIR process.
3 d. The city failed to make findings supported by substantial evidence that the 4

5 revised and newly-voluntary Historic Preservation Program would clearly have no

6 significant impacts.

7

8 WHEREFORE, petitioners pray:

9 1. That the Court issue judgment and a peremptory writ ordering the city

10 respondents to set aside all actions and approvals relating to the revised Historic
11

12 Preservation Program, requiring that before further consideration of approval the city

13 conduct an adequate and complete EIR process, identify and adopt feasible mitigation

14 measures and alternatives to lessen or avoid environmental impacts, and make all

2 A 15 findings required by CEQA, supported by substantial evidence;
16 2. That the Court enjoin the city and its employees and agents from all
17

18 physical actions furthering the Historic Preservation Program and related projects

19 while the petition is pending and after judgment pending compliance with the writ;

20 3. For petitioners' reasonable costs, expenses, and attorney fees pursuant to
21 Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5; and
22
4. For other and further relief as the Court 23 finds proper.

24 January 11, 2021 Respectfully submitted,
