FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT ÖF MANDATE

Petitioner, FRIENDS OF WESTWANDA DRIVE ("Petitioner"), alleges:

1. The project is a proposed single-family dwelling on an undeveloped property
3 located at 10034 Westwanda Drive, Los Angeles, CA ("Project"). The Project contemplates the
removal of 954 cubic yards of soil for the construction of a 3,238 single-family dwelling on
approximately 4,009 square foot never-before developed steep hillside site. The Project is

separate located on a hillside parcel at 10034 Westwanda Drive in Benedict Canyon (which is within the
Santa Monica Mountains). Westwanda Drive is less than 20 feet in width in at least four

8 locations (otherwise known as a "substandard" street). The vacant site is a beautiful, hillside

10 Conservancy ("SMMC"). Among other things, the Project requires the removal of protected trees 9 untouched adjacent to a large habitat block officially mapped by the Santa Monica Mountain

11 and the issuance of a Tree Removal Permit and applicable building and grading permits from the 8 d77 dnojo MET |euueuo LIZ06 12 unS "pAI8 8383 Wilshire 13 Petitioner, Friends of Westwanda ("Petitioner"), is an unincorporated association City of Los Angeles.

14 whose purpose is to promote the social welfare and environment in Benedict Canyon and in the 2. 8
'SIl!H Kueseg 15 area of Westwanda Drive in particular. Petitioner and its respective members have a direct and
16 substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondent complies with laws relating to
17 environmental protection. Petitioner and its respective members are adversely affected by
18 Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA in approving the Project. Petitioner has standing to
assert the claims raised in this Petition because Petitioner and its members' aesthetic and
20 environmental interests are directly and adversely affected by Respondent's' approval of the 19

21 Project.
22 Respondent, City of Los Angeles ("Respondent"), is a charter city incorporated
23 under the laws of the State of California. The City is the lead agency under the California 3.

Real Party in Interest, Karla Shahin is an owner of the property located at 10034 24 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").

26 Westwanda Drive. Real Party in Interest, Armen Melkonians, is listed as the "applicant" for the 25 4.

27 building and grading permits issued for the Project. Mr. Melkonians also appeared at all of the

2 28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

public hearings for the Project and testified as to his interest in the project. At the public hearing
2 before the Board of Public Works on March 7, 2018 Mr. Melkonians testified as follows: "T'm

3 the civil engineer for the project. I'm also the husband of the owner, so play a special role here

4 today." Further, at the public hearing before the Public Works and Gang Reduction Committee
on August 7, 2019 Mr. Melkonians testified as follows: "All right. I just wanted to introduce
6 myself. Armen Melkonians. I'm the owner." Finally, at the public hearing before the City
Council on August 20, 2019 Mr. Melkonians testified as follows: "Good morning. Armen
8 Melkonians, the property owner." In written correspondence to the City Mr. Melkonians also
stated that he was one of the owners of the property. Mr. Melkonians also stated to various city
10 officials and employees his intent to live at the proposed home with Ms. Shahin. At the Board of
11 Public Works hearing Mr. Melkonians testified as follows: "We plan on living there. We have a 8 d11'dnoJo MET lOuueud 90211 UNS "PAIA EJJYSIM €8E8 12 newborn. We just designed this house for ourselves. She's done the design, my wife. We're
13
& going to build it. We're going to live there. We're going to have a family." Based on these facts,
'SIl!H AUeAeS 14 Petitioner alleges that Real Party in Interest Armen Melkonians
15 has a direct interest in the development of the property in question and is a real party in interest.
16 Furthermore, based on the foregoing, Petitioner is informed and believes that Armen Melkonians
17 is an owner of the Project. Both Karla Shahin and Armen Melkonians are hereinafter referred to
18 collectively as "Real Party in Interest" or "Developer."
19 5. Real Party in Interest Armen Melkonians has threatened to institute litigation
20 against at least one member of Petitioner for opposing the Project. Failure to join Armen
21 Melkonians in the instant litigation would therefore "leave . .. persons already parties subject to
22 a substantial risk of incurring . . . inconsistent obligations by reason of his claimed interest."
23 Code Civ. Proc., § 389(a)(2)(ii). Accordingly, under such section, Mr. Melkonians is required to
24  be joined as a necessary party. a
25 6. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties sued herein
26 as ROES 1-25, inclusive, and therefore sues these Real Parties by such fictitious names.
27 Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of fictitiously named

On March 14, 2018, the City of Los Angeles Urban Forestry Division approved a alleged in this Petition.

5 Tree Removal Permit in order to facilitate the Project. The City erroneously determined that the 4 7.

authorized the removal of three Coast Live Oak Trees and six Southern California Black Walnut

8 P4InS "PAIE HUJYSI!M E8E8 13| This section of the Public Resources Code states as follows: "If a nonelected decisionmaking
'SIIH Áuexeg 14 body of a local lead agency certifies an environmental impact report, approves a negative
15 declaration or mitigated negative declaration, or determines that a project is not subject to this
16 division, that certification, approval, or determination may be appealed to the agency's elected
17 decisionmaking body, if any." A hearing was then conducted before the Public Works and Gang
18 Reduction Committee. Thereafter, the City Council denied Petitioner's appeal on August 20,
19 2019.
20 9. The developer filed a Notice of Exemption with the County Recorder on August
21 20, 2019. This action has been brought within 35 days of the filing of the aforementioned Notice
22 of Exemption with the County Recorder.

CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

10 13. California Environmental Quality Act is California's broadest environmental

11
sChanmellie worougute 950 law. CEQA helps to guide public agencies such as the City during issuance of permits and
•IZ06 306VHB IM SSO SIllH Áueseg 12 approval of projects. Courts have interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest protection of the
13 environment within the reasonable scope of the statutes. CEQA applies to all discretionary
14 projects proposed to be conducted or approved by a City, including private projects requiring
15| discretionary government approval. See California Public Resources Code, sections 21000 -
16| 21178, and Title 14 Cal. Code Regs., section 753, and Chapter 3, sections 15000 - 15387.
17 14. "CEQA broadly defines: 'project' as 'an activity which may cause either a direct
18 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the
19 environment, and ... that involves the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate,
20 or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies.' [Citation.] The statutory definition
21 is augmented by the [CEQA] Guidelines [Cal.Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et scq.], which define
22 'project' as 'the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct
23 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foresecable indirect physical change in the
24 environment...." Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Sonora
25 (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1222, 66 Cal.Rptr.3d 645 (Tuolumne County). This includes all
26 phases of a project that are reasonably foreseeable, and all related projects that are directly linked
27| to the project. (CEQA Guidelines section 15378).

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 15. A strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an Environmental

2 Impact Report ("EIR") is built into CEQA which is reflected in what is known as the "fair
3 argument" standard, under which an agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence

4 in the record supports fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the
5 environment. No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75, 82; Friends of "B" St.

6 v. City of Haywood (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988, 1002.

16. "The EIR is the primary means of achieving the Legislature's considered
8 declaration that it is the policy of this state to *take all action necessary to protect, rehabilitate, 7

and enhance the environmental quality of the state.' [Citation.] The EIR is therefore 'the heart of
10 CEQA.' [Citations.] An EIR is an 'environmental "alarm bell" whose purpose it is to alert the
public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached ecological 2 d17 'dnoJo MEl |ouueyo LLZ06 208 VpoE Beverly Hills, 12| points of no return." Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California 11

13 (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.
14 17. Under CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, if a project is not exempt and may cause EJJYS|!M E888 15 a significant effect on the environment, the agency must prepare an EIR. PRC §§ 21100, 21151;
16 14 Cal. Code Regs. §15064(a)(1), (f)(1). "Significant effect upon the environment" is defined as
17 "a substantial or potentially substantial adverse change in the environment." PRC §21068; 14 Cal
Code Regs §15382. A project "may" have significant effect on the environment if there is a
19 "reasonable probability" that it will result in a significant impact. No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los 18

1 Petition.

2 19. The City determined that the Project was exempt from CEQA as a Class 3 project.
3 The Class 3 exemption is reserved for new construction or conversion of small structures (which

4 include the construction of one single family dwelling). However, according to the State CEQA
5 Guidelines, the following exceptions are applicable to the use of this exemption:
6 (a) Location. Classes 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the
7 project is to be located -- a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the

8 environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these
o classes are considered to apply all instances, except where the project may impact on an
10 environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely
11 mapped, and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.
d17 8 LLZ06 12 (b) Cumulative Impact. All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the PIINS "pAlE ENIJUSI!M E8€8 jauueuo ME7 dnois 13 8 cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is
SIlH Auereg 14 significant.
15 (c) Significant Effect. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity
16 where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on
17 the environment due to unusual circumstances.

18 (d) Scenic Highways. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project
19 which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees,
20 historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources, within a highway officially
21 designated as a state scenic highway. This does not apply to improvements which are
22 required as mitigation by an adopted negative declaration or certified EIR.
23 (e) Hazardous Waste Sites. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project
24 located on a site which is included on any list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of
25 the Government Code.

26 (f) Historical Resources. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project
27 which may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

20. The City also determined that the Project was exempt from CEQA as a Class 3 2
2 urban infill project. However, this exemption is not available when there are "unusual
circumstances" associated with the Project.

4 21. As explained below, the City erroneously concluded that the Project was eligible

5 for the Class and Class 32 categorical exemptions.

22. The Project's Location and Impacts Prevents the City from Utilizing the Class 3
Exemption. As explained in the CEQA Guidelines, "a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its

8 impact on the environment may in › particularly sensitive environment be significant." CEQA
9 Guidelines Section 15300.2(a). An exemption does not apply where the project may impact on
10 an environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely mapped,
11 and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies. Ã d17 'dnoJo MET |euueyo 90211 12 23. The Santa Monica Mountains Comprehensive Plan was adopted in 1979. The
13 8 unS "pAIa 8383 Wilshire property is subject to the Plan because it is located within the Santa Monica Mountains Zone.
SIlIH ÁueAeE 14 The Zone was established by the Legislature via the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy Act,
15 which is codified at Section 33001 of the Public Resources Code. The Act states as follows:
16

17 "The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the Santa Monica Mountains Zone, as
defined in Section 33105, is a unique and
18 valuable economic, environmental, agricultural, scientific, educational, and recreational resource that should be held in trust for present and future generations; that, 19 as the last large undeveloped area contiguous to the shoreline within the greater Los

20 Angeles metropolitan region, comprised of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties, it provides essential relief from the urban environment; that it exists as a it single
21 ecosystem in which changes that affect one part may also affect all other parts; and that the preservation and protection of this resource is in the public interest."
22

23 24. The Legislature itself declared that the Santa Monica Mountains Zone is

24 a unique and valuable environmental resource that provided essential relief from the urban
25 environment. The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy Act goes on to say the following:

26
"in the absence of a governmental mechanism to perform such evaluations, piecemeal 27 development projects were occurring within the zone which resulted in

28 the irreplaceable loss of open space and recreational resources, in the physical and

8

biological deterioration of air, land, and water systems within the zone, and adversely
affected regional life-support systems, including fish and wildlife, therefore being
2 harmful to the needs of the present and future population of the region."

25. The Legislature further declared at PRC Section 33008 that:

"there are existing problems of substandard lots, incompatible land uses, conflicts with recreational use, and inadequate resource protection which, in some cases, cannot be
addressed in a feasible manner by local government exercise of the police power or federal land acquisition as part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, and that it is necessary to enact the provisions of this division as a complement to the full
8 exercise of the police power by local governments...

9

26. The Legislature also stated that "the people of the State of California have an 10

11 interest in the protection of resources and the use of lands acquired or managed by the
8 d77 *dnoJg ME7 jauueuo LLZ06 12 conservancy pursuant to this division, and that the conservancy in carrying out its duties pursuant

27. The City of Los Angeles adopted a formal resolution in 1979 undertaking its 'SIIIH Auereg 14

area serves as a refuge for area wildlife. Refuges such as this are important elements of the urban 28. The property's value as habitat for flora and fauna cannot be disputed. The entire 18

20 landscape and their value cannot be dismissed. Developments like the proposed Project displace 19

21 'urban wildlife' into residential backyards and city streets, and habitat disruption can result in an
22 imbalance on food chain populations and lead wildlife to seek both food and shelter in residential

have significant effect on the environment. This standard of review was recently outlined in
2 Berkeley Hills Watershed Coalition V. City of Berkeley (2019) 31 Cal.App.5th 880. There should
3 be no doubt that the Santa Monica Mountains Zone comprises an environmental resource of

4 critical concern. As noted in Berkeley Hills Watershed Coalition, a "resource" is a "natural

5 source of wealth or revenue," or a "natural feature or phenomenon that enhances the quality of
6 human life." Legislature's explicit findings regarding the characteristics of the Zone in the Santa
1 Monica Mountains Conservancy Act more than meets this definitional requirement. Further,
8 Petitioner demonstrated during the administrative process that the Project will have a potentially
9 significant environmental impact even after replacement trees are planted. Petitioner
10| commissioned an expert report and the author concluded that the loss of habitat of a sensitive
11
8 natural community constitutes a significant impact that is not mitigated by application of the Channel Law Group, d71 eyns "pAja euysIM €8s8 LZ06 12 City's Protected Tree Ordinance.

8 13 31. In sum, the use of the Class 3 single-family home exemption cannot be used
Beverly Hills, 14 because of the project's location and the potential for significant impacts on the environment.
15 The Santa Monica Mountains are an environmental resource of critical concern that have been
16 designed and precisely mapped pursuant to state law, and the Project will have a potentially
17 significant impact on the environment.
18 32. Unusual Circumstances Pertaining to Biological Resources Renders Both Class 3

19 and Class 32 Exemption Unavailable. Both of the exemptions utilized by the City are
20 unavailable due to "unusual circumstances." Application of both exemptions is limited by the
21 factors described in section 15300.2." An exemption should be denied if one of the exceptions
22 listed in section 15300.2 of the Guidelines applies. Section 15300.2, subdivision (c), of the
23 Guidelines provides for one such exception and states that if there is a "reasonable possibility"
24 of a "significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances," then the categorical
25 exception cannot apply. A "circumstance is 'unusual' • judged relative to the typical
26 circumstances related to an otherwise typically exempt project." Voices for Rural Living V. El
27 Dorado Irr. Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1096, 1108-09. Petitioner commissioned an expert

10

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 report from Land Protection Partners to demonstrate that mere replacement of trees would not
2  reduce the impacts of the Project on biological resources. Notably, the expert concluded that
3 the loss of habitat of a sensitive natural community constitutes a significant impact that is not
4 mitigated by application of the City's Protected Tree Ordinance.

5 33. The Project is Not Exempt from CEQA Because the City Has Proposed Mitigation

6 Measures in the Form of Specialized Conditions of Approval for the Project. Significantly, in
7 evaluating whether a categorical exemption may apply, the City may not rely on mitigation
8 measures as a basis for concluding that a project is categorically exempt, or as a basis for
9 determining that one of the significant effects exceptions does not apply. Salmon Protection &
10| Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098.
11 34. The City has sought to deem this project "exempt" from City by way of an 8 Channel Law Group, d77 LZ06 12 environmental mitigation measure namely, the planting of replacement trees on the property.
13
8 uns "paa aJjysim e:g However, the general requirement to plant replacement trees is not a regulatory compliance
Hills, Beverly 14 measure at all. Rather, it is a discretionary environmental mitigation measure. The City's
15 Protected Tree Ordinance states as follows:

16 "The Board of Public Works or its authorized officer or employee may [r]equire as a
17 condition of a grant of permit for the relocation or removal of a protected tree, that the

property boundaries by at least two trees of a 18 permittee replace the tree within the same
19 protected variety included within the definition set forth in Section 46.01 of this Code, in
20 a manner acceptable to the Board."
21 LAMC Section 46.02(c).
22 35. The Ordinance uses the word "may" - not "shall." This is significant. The tree
23 replacements that are traditionally mandated by the Board of Public Works are discretionary
24 environmental mitigation measures. They are not mandatory "regulatory compliance measures."
25 a The City cannot use a mitigation measure to reach a determination that a project is exempt from
26 CEQA. This is fundamental black letter CEQA law.
27 36. Further, the Grading Division has issued a Geology and Soils Report Approval
28

11

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 conditions are not simply applications of the California Building Code or existing City of Los 1 Letter for the Project. This letter contains numerous conditions of approval. Many of these

3 Angeles regulations. The fact that the Geology Report contains specialized mitigation measures
4 renders the application of a categorical exemption in appropriate and unlawful.
5 37. The Project is Also Not Exempt from CEQA Because the City Seeks to Defer
Application of Mitigation Measures to Another Date. Additionally, many of the conditions of
7 approval in the Geology and Soils Report Approval Letter simply "kick the can" down the road 6

8 and defer required environmental analysis to another date. This does not comply with CEQA.

38. Conditioning a project on another agency's future review of environmental
10 impacts, without evidence of the likelihood of effective mitigation by the other agency, is
11 insufficient to support a determination by the lead agency that potentially significant impacts will 8 d11 "dnoJo Mel jeuueyd LIZ06 GOS VPNE MNUSIMA GE CE 'SI!H AueAeS 12 be mitigated. Sundstrom v. Cnty. of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296. Further, requiring
13 formulation of mitigation measures at a future time violates the rule that members of the public
14 and other agencies must be given an opportunity to review mitigation measures before a project
is approved. PRC § 21080, subd. (c)(2)). See League for Protection of Oakland Architectural &
16 Historic Resources v. City of Oakland (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 896; Gentry v. City of Murrieta 15

24 mitigation measures before a proposed negative declaration is released for public review. PRC §
25 21080, subd. (c)(2); 14 Cal Code Regs § 15070(b)(1). Studies conducted after a project's
26 approval do not guarantee an adequate inquiry into environmental effects. Such a mitigation
27 measure would effectively be exempt from public and governmental scrutiny.
