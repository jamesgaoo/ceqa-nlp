0. Airport Land Use Commission ("ALUC") that the Project is inconsistent with

u A the ALUC's airport land use compatibility plan for Travis Air Force Base.
c. A decision by SMUD's governing board that the ALUC lacked jurisdiction to

6 review the Project for consistency with the ALUC's airport land use
compatibility plan for Travis Air Force Base.

N

8 d. A decision by SMUD's governing board, pursuant to Public Resources Code

e.

10 A decision by SMUD's governing board, pursuant to Public Resources Code

11 section 21152, to approve the Project based on the environmental

2. it had certified for the Project. impact report

12

13 The County of Solano ("COUNTY") alleges herein that SMUD prejudicially

14 abused its discretion in making these decisions, in that SMUD did not proceed in the manner

15 required by law, that SMUD's decisions are not supported by the findings, and that SMUD's
findings are not supported by the evidence.
3.

16

17 COUNTY further alleges herein that an actual controversy exists between

18 COUNTY and SMUD regarding their respective rights and duties under Public Utilities Code
sections 21671.5, 21676, and 21676.5.

19 4. PARTIES

20

21 Petitioner/Plaintiff County of Solano ("COUNTY"), a political subdivision of the

22 State of California, is responsible for regulating and controlling land use in the unincorporated

23 territory of Solano County and is a Responsible Agency for the Project to the extent that the

5.

24 project is subject to the County's land use and development regulations and permit requirements.

25 COUNTY, through its governing board, the Board of Supervisors, acts in a
representative capacity for the residents of Solano County.

6.

26

27 COUNTY has beneficial interest in the subject matter of this litigation in its

28 capacity as both a political subdivision and a representative of the residents of Solano County.
7. Respondent/Defendant Sacramento Municipal Utility District ("SMUD") is
municipal utility district, organized and operating pursuant to the Municipal Utility District Act

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

(Pub. Util. Code, § 11501 et seq.). SMUD is a "local agency" as that term is defined and used in
2 Title 1, Division 2, Chapter 1, Article 5 of the Government Code (§§ 53090-53097.5), Division 9,
Part 1, Chapter 4, Article 3.5 of the Public Utilities Code (§§ 21670-21679.5), and the California

4 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"; Pub. Res. Code, § 21000 et seq.), and is the Lead Agency

5 for the Solano 4 Wind Project for purposes of CEQA.

6 8. COUNTY does not know the true names and capacities, whether individual,
7 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of Respondents/Defendants Doe 1 through Doe 10, inclusive,
8 and therefore sues these Respondents/Defendants under fictitious names. COUNTY alleges,

9 upon information and belief, that each fictionally named Respondent/Defendant is responsible in
10 some manner for committing the acts upon which this action is based. COUNTY will amend this
11 Petition and Complaint to show their true names and capacities if and when they have been
12 ascertained. COUNTY alleges, upon information and belief, that each Doe
13 Respondent/Defendant is the agent and/or employee of each other Doe Respondent/Defendant,
14 and each performed acts on which this action is based within the course or scope of such Doe
15 Respondent/Defendants' agency and/or employment.
16 9. The Solano County Airport Land Use Commission ("ALUC") is body
17 designated pursuant to Public Utilities Code section 21670.1, subdivision (a), to perform the
18 planning responsibilities of an airport land use commission as provided for in Division 9, Part 1,
19 Chapter 4, Article 3.5 of the Public Utilities Code (§§ 21670-21679.5; hereinafter "ALUC Law").
20 Although the ALUC has interests that are directly involved in the subject matter of this litigation,
21 the ALUC has not been named as a party because its interests in the issues presented by this
22 litigation regarding the ALUC's jurisdiction and SMUD's findings overruling the ALUC'S
23 determination are aligned with those of COUNTY and are adequately represented by COUNTY
24 in this action.

25 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

26 10. This Court has jurisdiction of the matters alleged in this Petition and Complaint
27 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1094.5 and 1060, Government Code section 53096,
28 and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.9.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 11. Venue is proper in this Court because Government Code section 53096 requires

2 any action brought pursuant to that section to be commenced in the superior court of the county

3 whose zoning ordinance is involved.

4 12. Venue is proper in this Court because the Solano 4 Wind Project is proposed for

5 construction in Solano County.

6 1. COUNTY has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

7 21167.5 by serving written notice of COUNTY's intent to commence this action on SMUD on

8 September 17, 2021. A copy of this notice and proof of service on SMUD is being filed

9 concurrently with this Petition.

10 13. COUNTY will comply with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

11 21167.7 by furnishing a copy of this Petition and Complaint to the California Attorney General.
12 14. COUNTY has performed all conditions precedent to filing the instant action and
13 has exhausted all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.
14 15. COUNTY has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
15 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require SMUD to set aside its approvals
16 of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, SMUD's approvals of the Project will remain in
17 effect in violation of law.

18 STATEMENT OF FACTS

19 I. Prior Phases of the Solano Wind Project
20 16. SMUD owns various properties in Solano County, including two sites,
21 approximately three miles apart, that are proposed to be developed together as the Solano 4 Wind
22 Project. The western site, referred to as Solano 4 West, is near the town of Collinsville while the
23 eastern site, referred to Solano 4 East, is approximately 3.5 miles southwest of Rio Vista.
24 17. In or around December 1993, SMUD certified an environmental impact report
25 ("EIR") for the Solano Wind Project, which proposed to develop up to 181 wind turbines
26 generators ("WTGs") with a combined generation capacity of up to 50 megawatts. The area to be
27 developed as the Solano Wind Project is approximately the northern half of the area now referred
28 to as Solano 4 East.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

- 18.

2 By February 2002, SMUD had constructed approximately 10% of the Solano

3 Wind Project as originally approved. Instead of completing that project as approved, SMUD

A proposed to modify that project by using up to 80 taller, larger diameter WTGs to generate up to

5 same originally approved 50 megawatts. SMUD prepared and certified a Supplemental EIR for

6 this project modification and approved the project modification in July 2002. By 2004, SMUD

7 had installed 23 Vestas V47 WTGs in the Solano Wind Project (a.k.a. Solano 4 East) area.
19.

8 In July 2003, SMUD proposed to further modify the Solano Wind Project to

9 increase generation capacity to approximately 100 megawatts; this increase would be achieved by

10 installing more WTGs that were taller and had a larger rotor diameter than previously approved

11 through the 2002 Supplemental EIR. SMUD prepared and certified another Supplemental EIR

12 for this project modification and approved the project modification in or around February 2004.

13 Between 2004 and 2007, SMUD installed 29 Vestas V90 WTGs pursuant to the 2004 project
modification.

14 20.

15 The portion of the Solano Wind Project area developed with the 23 Vestas V47

16 WTGs is sometimes referred to as the Phase Project while the portion developed with the 29

17 Vestas V90 WTGs is sometimes referred to as the Phase 2 Project.

21.

18 WTGs have a finite operational lifespan. This operational lifespan can be

19 extended to some extent by repairing or replacing parts as they wear out, suffer damage, or
malfunction. WTGs are also an

20 evolving technology, with newer models typically taller and with

21 larger rotors than previous ones. Due to their increased height and rotor-swept area, these newer

22 models are capable of generating more electricity per WTG than earlier models. For wind facility

23 operators, it is sometimes more cost effective and more productive to replace aging WTGs with

24 newer models than to keep the existing ones operational through refurbishment and repair. This

25 replacement of older WTGs with newer, more productive ones, typically when the older ones

26 reach end-of-life, is sometimes referred to as "repowering" the facility.

22.

27 The WTGs in the Phase 1 Project are anticipated to reach end-of-life in 2023,

28 approximately 20 years after they were installed, although that facility could remain operational
until the late 2020s.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORV REIIEF

1 23. Land use permits issued by COUNTY for various privately owned and operated
2 wind projects in the Wind Resource Area, including the Shiloh I, Shiloh II, Shiloh III, Shiloh I, IV,
Montezuma I, and Montezuma II projects, are fixed-term permits that will each expire without

4 further action by COUNTY on a date specified in the permit.
24. The various EIRs for the original and modified Solano Wind Project, including the

6 original 1993 EIR and the 2002 and 2004 Supplemental EIRs, did not discuss or evaluate the
7 potential impacts that the various iterations of that project could have on the air traffic control
8 radar system operated by Travis Air Force Base ("Travis AFB").

9 25. In a letter sent to the Solano County Planning Commission in March 2007, Travis
10 AFB raised concerns that another then-proposed wind facility project in the Wind Resource Area
11 could adversely impact radar. According to Travis AFB, the then-existing WTGs in the Wind
12 Resource Area were affecting the performance of Travis AFB's radar equipment, making it
13 difficult for Travis AFB's air traffic controllers to track aircraft in the area. Travis AFB asked
14 that no new wind turbine generators be constructed in the Wind Resource Area until its new

15 ASR-11 radar system was installed and operational.

16 26. In September 2007, SMUD circulated a Draft EIR for the Phase 3 Project, which
17 proposed up to 85 WTGs in an area south-west and south-east of the Phase 1 and Phase 2 1

18 projects. That Draft EIR identified increased risk of accidental aircraft collision hazards due to

19 interference with radar signals as a potential impact of the project, but concluded this potential
20 impact was less than significant because previous wind project in the Wind Resource Area had
21 been issued "No Hazard Determinations" by the Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA") and
22 because the Phase 3 Project would be farther from Travis AFB radar than these previous projects.
23 27. The 2007 Draft EIR also noted that the Phase 3 Project required review by the
24 ALUC to consider the project's compatibility with the ALUC's Travis AFB Land Use
25 Compatibility Plan.

26 28. Travis AFB's ASR-11 air traffic control radar system was installed in October
27 2008 and was operational in February 2009.

H 29.

2 SMUD circulated a revised Draft EIR for the Phase 3 Project in October 2009,
reducing the maximum number of WTGs from 85 to 75 due to removal of a 411-acre area from

3

4 the south-west portion of the previously proposed Phase 3 Project area. At that time, the 411-acre

5 area was already developed with 62 Kenetech 56-100 WTGs operated by enXco, and SMUD had

6 decided it did it not want to remove these existing WTG's and install new ones in this area as part

7 of the Phase 3 Project. These Kenetech 56-100 WTGs eventually reached their end-of-life and
were removed in 2019.

30. The 2009 Recirculated Draft EIR for

9 the Phase 3 Project identified the potential

10 for WTGs to interfere with radar signals, thereby increasing the risk of accidental aircraft

11 collision hazards, as a potential impact of the Phase 3 Project. The Recirculated Draft EIR

12 concluded this potential impact was less than significant and that no mitigation was required.
31.

13 On January 20, 2010, the ALUC adopted a resolution determining that the Phase 3

14 Project was consistent with its land use compatibility plans then in effect for Travis Air Force
Base and the Rio Vista Airport.
15 32.

16 SMUD certified the Recirculated EIR and approved the Phase 3 Project in or
around February 2010.

17 II. The Solano 4 Wind Project
18 33.

19 In 2016, SMUD began studying a possible Phase 4 project consisting of 17 Vesta

20 V117 WTGs to be located on the Solano 4 West site. Although a portion of that site already had

21 approximately 59 Kenetech 56-100 turbines located on it at that time, those WTGs reached end-
of-life and were removed in 2019.

22 34. By 2018, SMUD had modified the Phase 4

23 project design to consist of either 22

24 Vestas V136 WTGs or 19 Vestas V150 WTGs, split between the Solano 4 West and Solano 4

25 East sites. SMUD described the portion of the Phase 4 project to be developed on the Solano 4

26 East site as a "repower" project because the 23 existing Vestas V47 WTGs on that site, which are

27 anticipated to reach end-of-life in 2023, would be removed and replaced by either 10 Vestas
V136 WTGs or 9 Vestas V150 WTGs.

28

FIRST AMENNEN PETITION COD WDIT AE MANDATE

35.

2 SMUD issued a Notice of Preparation for the Solano 4 Wind Project on or about

January 9, 2019.

3 36. SMUD released its Draft EIR for the

4 Solano 4 Wind Project for public review and

5 comment on or about July 23, 2019. The proposed project, as described in the Draft EIR,
included the following elements or components:

a.

7 Removal of the existing Vestas V47 WTGs from the Solano 4 East site.

b. Construction of up to 22 new WTGs, with up to 10 in the Solano 4 East site

-5o and up to 12 in the Solano 4 West site, with a combined electrical generating
capacity of up to 91 megawatts delivered at the point of interconnection with
the grid.

C.
12 Electrical lines connecting the WTGs to the point of interconnection with the

13 grid; these lines would transmit the electricity produced by the WTGs from the

14 generators to the grid. The Draft EIR referred to these as "collector lines."
d. Minor upgrades to the Russel Substation.

15 e. Access roads within each of the two sites to

16 support the new WTGs.

17 f. Ongoing operation and maintenance activities during the lifespan of the project

18 and decommissioning of the project when it reached end-of-life.
37.

19 If the Project was approved, construction of the new WTGs would start in

20 approximately 2023, after removal of the existing WTGs from the Solano 4 East site.

38.

21 The Draft EIR identified 45 broad categories of impacts that the Project could

22 cause to the environment and evaluated whether each of these categories of impacts would be

23 significant or less than significant, both before and after the mitigation measures recommended in

24 the Draft EIR were imposed on the Project. Several of these broad categories of impacts included

25 sub-categories. For example, the discussion of Impact 3.3-5 evaluated the removal and

26 modification of raptor nesting, foraging, and roosting habitat during project construction, and

27 concluded that the impacts on nesting habitat would be less than significant before mitigation was

28 imposed while the impacts on foraging habitat would be potentially significant before mitigation
was imposed. To address latter sub-category of impacts, the Draft EIR recommended that off-site

DIDOT A MONNEA T EOR REAE AD A PAD T PT ICE

2 foraging habitat be acquired and concluded that the potential significance of this sub-category of

3 impact would be less than significant after mitigation was imposed.
39. The Draft EIR identified the

4 potential impacts of the Project on air traffic safety

un and the two sub-categories of air navigation and air traffic control radar as follows:

6 Impact 3.7-3: Safety hazard to air traffic. The project site lies within the

7 planning boundary of the Travis AFB LUCP, which contains policies

O co designed to promote land use compatibility with airport operations.
Placement of WTGs have the potential to intrude into navigable airspace,

10 thereby increasing the risk of aircraft collision, or causing interference with

11 radar signals used by air traffic control. Therefore, this impact would be

12 potentially significant.

40.

13 The Draft EIR recommended, as Mitigation Measure 3.7-3, that the WTGs be

14 marked and lighted "to ensure proper conspicuity of the turbines at night." The Draft EIR did not

15 recommend any mitigation for the potentially significant impact to air traffic control radar.

16 Nevertheless, the Draft EIR concluded that both sub-categories of potentially significant impacts
identified and discussed as

17 Impact 3.7-3 - increased risk of aircraft collisions and interference

18 with air traffic control radar - would be reduced to a less than significant level after

19 recommended mitigation measure 3.7-3 was imposed on the Project.
41.

20 The Draft EIR evaluated the potential significance of the impact that the Project

21 would have on the Travis AFB air traffic control radar by estimating the marginal increase in

22 radar interference that would exist after the Project is constructed and operational in comparison

23 to the amount of existing radar interference as of the baseline date when the studies were

24 conducted. This baseline existing radar interference includes interference caused by the existing

25 Vestas V47 WTGs of the Solano Wind Phase 1 Project. The Draft EIR and its supporting radar

26 interference studies did not account for the fact that the Solano Wind Phase 1 Project is

27 anticipated to be decommissioned and removed from the Solano 4 East site in approximately two

28 years, and that the amount of radar interference caused by that earlier project would be reduced to
zero once it reaches end-of-life.

FIDOT AMPRNEA nAn

1 42. The Solano 4 Wind Project has an estimated lifespan of approximately 20 years.
2 43. Although the Draft EIR disclosed that the Project would cause marginal increase
3 in the magnitude of radar interference in comparison to existing conditions, the Draft EIR did not
4 disclose that the Project would also cause a significant increase in the duration of the radar
5 interference impact in comparison to the no project alternative. The Draft EIR did not evaluate

6 the significance of the Project's potential impacts to air traffic control radar in light of the
7 Project's significant increase in duration of impact.

8 44. The Draft EIR briefly discussed alternative locations and alternative technologies
9 as possible project alternatives and concluded both were infeasible. For alternative technologies,
10 the Draft EIR identified both solar and nuclear. The Draft EIR concluded that nuclear "would
11 likely result in greater impacts than the proposed project." The Draft EIR provided no evaluation
12 or conclusion regarding use of solar as a project alternative other than the unsupported conclusory
13 statement that solar was infeasible.

14 45. The Draft EIR did not evaluate or discuss alternative methods or routes for the
15 electrical lines that would connect the WTGs to the point of interconnection with the grid, nor did
16 the Draft EIR evaluate the feasibility of alternative methods or routes.
17 46. The two project alternatives selected for detailed analysis in the Draft EIR were
18 the no project alternative and a reduced turbine height alternative, the latter of which would
19 utilize shorter WTGs but more of them compared to the proposed project.
20 47. COUNTY submitted comments on the Draft EIR in a letter dated September 8,
21 2019. In its comments, COUNTY raised the following issues and concerns:
22 a. Contrary to various statements in the Draft EIR, the ALUC is not an agency,
23 commission, or part of County government.
24 b. The ALUC's land use compatibility plan is not the legal equivalent of a county
25 zoning or building ordinance for purposes of Government Code sections 53091
26 and 53096.

27 c. The Draft EIR did not explain the basis for the findings SMUD would need to
28 make in order to overrule an inconsistency determination by the ALUC.

3 d. The ALUC's role should be accurately described in the Draft EIR.

L e. The Draft EIR incorrectly described the Project, and all elements of the

a u Project, as exempt from County zoning ordinances pursuant to Government
Code section 53091.

f. The Draft EIR failed to describe the process required by Public Utilities Code

8 section 12808.5 for a municipal utility district such as SMUD to locate and
construct transmission and distribution lines.

9

10 g. The Draft EIR's recommended mitigation measures for the Project's potential
impacts on County roads were inadequate.

11

12 48. h. The Draft EIR's evaluation of the Project's potential impacts to Travis AFB's
air traffic control radar system was inadequate.

13

14 SMUD released its Final EIR for the Solano 4 Wind Project on or about July 30,
2021. The Final EIR included SMUD's

49.

15 responses to COUNTY's comments on the Draft EIR.

16 50. COUNTY submitted additional comments to SMUD on August 19, 2021, prior to
SMUD taking action to certify the EIR or approve the Project.

17

18 51. On August 19, 2021, SMUD's governing board conducted a noticed public hearing

19 to take evidence and to consider its staff's recommendations regarding the EIR and the Project.

20 At the conclusion of its August 19, 2021, public hearing, SMUD's governing

21 board voted unanimously to adopt Resolution No. 21-08-05. Through that resolution, SMUD's
governing board made the following findings and took the following actions:

22

23 a. Found that the Project is not subject to the jurisdiction of the ALUC.

24 b. Found that SMUD had sought "advisory review" by the ALUC of the Project's

25 consistency with the ALUC's 2015 Travis Air Force Base Land Use

26 Compatibility Plan "in the spirit of inter-agency comity" rather than in
compliance with SMUD's legal obligations.

27 c. Certified that the Project EIR complies with CEQA.

Land Use Compatibility Plan pursuant to Government Code section 53091,

N subdivision (e).

i.

8 Found, for purposes of Government Code section 53096, that there are no

9 feasible alternatives to the Project.

10 j. Found that the Project is consistent with the State Aeronautics Act, thereby

14 In a letter dated August 23, 2021, sent via email and addressed to James Leland, a

15 COUNTY-employed planner who serves as ALUC staff pursuant to Public Utilities Code section

16 21671.5, SMUD purported to provide notice to both the County and the ALUC that it had found

17 there was no feasible alternative to the Project for purposes of Government Code section 53096.

18 To date, SMUD has not provided such notice of non-feasibility directly to COUNTY.

III.

19 ALUC Review of the Solano 4 Wind Project

53.

20 In 2015 and in accordance with Public Utilities Code section 21675, the ALUC

21 adopted an updated airport land use compatibility plan for Travis AFB ("Travis AFB LUCP").
54.

22 SMUD has not submitted a general plan, special plan, capital improvement plan,
or other similar

23 type of long-range planning document to the ALUC for a consistency

24 determination, pursuant to Public Utilities Code section 21676, subdivision (a).

55.

25 SMUD's Notice of Preparation for the Solano 4 Wind Project, issued on or about

26 January 9, 2019, stated, "SMUD, as a local agency, is not required to obtain ALUC approval for

27 the development of their electrical generation facilities such as the Project."

4 57. On April 26, 2019, SMUD responded to the ALUC's comments and assertion of

5 jurisdiction. In its response, SMUD argued that the ALUC did not have jurisdiction to review the
Project for two reasons: First, electrical generation facilities are exempt from county zoning
7 ordinance pursuant to Government Code section 53091 and the ALUC's Travis AFB LUCP was

8 "tantamount" to a county zoning ordinance since it was an exercise of COUNTY's constitutional

9 police power; second; the FAA's issuance of No Hazard Determinations for the Project's WTGs
10 preempted the ALUC from exercising the jurisdiction conferred on it by California statute. it
11 58. On September 6, 2019, the ALUC provided comments to SMUD on the Draft EIR
12 and replied to various statements and arguments made by SMUD in its April 26, 2019, letter.
13 59. On September 3, 2019, the California Department of Transportation, Division of
14 Aeronautics, provided comments to SMUD on the Draft EIR and expressed its opinion that the
15 ALUC did indeed have jurisdiction to review the Project for consistency with the Tavis AFB
16 LUCP.

17 60. On or about April 1, 2021, SMUD submitted an application to the ALUC seeking
18 a determination regarding the Project's consistency with the Travis AFB LUCP.
19 61. The ALUC conducted a noticed public hearing on SMUD's application on May
20 20, 2021, considered the evidence presented, and made its determination that the Project was not
21 consistent with the compatibility criteria set forth in the Travis AFB LUCP.

22 62. SMUD did not seek judicial review of the ALUC's determination or otherwise
23 argue that the ALUC's determination was not supported by the evidence. Instead, SMUD
24 proposed to overrule the ALUC's determination.

25 63. SMUD provided a copy of its proposed findings and decision overruling the
26 ALUC's determination on or about July 2, 2021. In its proposed findings and decision, SMUD
27 repeated its claim that the ALUC did not have jurisdiction to review the Project and that SMUD
28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & AINT FOD NECE ADATODV DEI IEE

had nevertheless sought ALUC's "advisory opinion" of the Project "in the spirit of inter-agency
2 comity."

3 64. The ALUC provided comments to SMUD on July 29, 2021, regarding SMUD's
4 proposed findings and decision. In these comments, the ALUC explained that the Project does
5 fall within the jurisdiction of the ALUC and that SMUD's proposed findings and decision to
6 overrule the ALUC's determination were inadequate and did not comply with state law.
7 65. On August 19, 2021, through its Resolution No. 21-08-05, SMUD's governing

8 board unanimously adopted the previously distributed proposed findings and decision overruling
the ALUC's determination for the Project.

10 IRST CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (Gov. Code, § 53096; Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5)

12 66. COUNTY hereby realleges and incorporates the allegations set forth in paragraphs
13 through 65, above.

14 67. In City of Hesperia v. Lake Arrowhead Community Services Dist. (2019) 37
15 Cal.App.5th 734, 759, the Court of Appeal held that the community services district's electrical
16 lines connecting the district's photovoltaic electrical generation panels of its solar energy project
17 to the point of interconnection with the grid were "transmission lines" for purposes of the

18 exception to the exemption from city and county zoning regulations in Government Code section

19 53091, subdivision (e). The appellate court explained its decision as follows:

20 [B]ecause the District's proposed project includes the transmission of electrical energy,
21 the exemption contained in section 53091(e) does not apply to the project; and because the
22 administrative record does not contain substantial evidence to support the District's
23 board's finding that there is no feasible alternative to the proposed location of the project,
24 the District prejudicially abused its discretion in determining that the exemption contained
25 in section 53096(a) applied to the project.

26 68. The "collection lines" proposed and described by SMUD as part of the Project are
27 transmission lines for purposes of Government Code section 53091 and are not exempt from the

28 County zoning ordinances.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE R COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORV RELIEE 14

69. On August 19, 2021, through its Resolution No. 21-08-05, SMUD's governing
2 board unanimously adopted findings that there was no feasible alternative to the Project, thereby
3 purportedly rendering COUNTY's zoning ordinances inapplicable to the Project pursuant to

4 Government Code section 53096.

5 70. These finding are not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

6 71. The findings include a finding that there is no feasible alternative location for the
7 project. Conclusory statements that the proposed project would be cheaper to develop than
8 equivalent projects at alternative locations is not substantial evidence that developing an

9 equivalent project at an alternative location is economically infeasible. The is no evidence of
10 actual costs or net revenues cited or referenced in the findings to support a finding that alternative
11 locations are infeasible from an economic standpoint. This finding of economic infeasibility is
12 not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

13 72. The findings include a finding that there are no alternative energy generation
14 technologies for the project. To support this finding, SMUD says that use of an energy
15 production technology other than wind would not fulfill SMUD's stated project objective of
16 "develop[ing] an economically feasible wind project." A statement that energy generation
17 technologies other than wind are not wind technologies is a truism, not evidence. Statements that
18 SMUD requires "resource diversity" in its energy generation portfolio is evidence that alternative
19 generation technologies are desirable, feasible, and necessary; otherwise, SMUD would be
20 confined to using wind as its only energy generation technology. This finding is not supported by
21 substantial evidence in the record.

22 73. The findings include a finding that there are no feasible wind technologies for the
23 project. As evidence to support this finding, SMUD explains why using WTGs less than 100 feet
24 tall would be infeasible. The Draft EIR describes the Project as having WTGs that would be 492
25 to 591 feet (150 - 180 meters) tall. The finding cites the Draft EIR as evidence that using 138-
26 meter WTGs would be infeasible. Contrary to this characterization, the Draft EIR section cited in
27 the findings merely states that using 138-meter turbines would produce less energy than using the
28 taller 150-meter or 180-meter WTGs proposed for the Project, not that use of the shorter WTGs

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORV RELIER

1 would be infeasible, economically or otherwise. This finding is not supported by substantial
2 evidence in the record.

3 74. As a result of the foregoing defects, SMUD prejudicially abused its discretion.
4 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (Pub. Util. Code, § 21676.5; Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5)
6 75. COUNTY hereby realleges and incorporates the allegations set forth in paragraphs
7 through 74, above.

8 76. The State Aeronautics Act is codified in Division 9, Part of the Public Utilities

9 Code, beginning at section 21001. The ALUC Law, Chapter 4, Article 3.5 of the State
10 Aeronautics Act, in sections 21670 through 21679.5, describes the purpose, jurisdiction,
11 authority, obligations, and processes of airport land use commissions such as the ALUC.
12 77. Section 21676.5 provides that if the airport land use commission has not
13 determined that a local agency's general plan, special plan, or other similar plan is consistent with
14 that commission's airport land use compatibility plan, or if the local agency has overruled the
15 commission's determination of inconsistency regarding its plan, then the local agency shall
16 submit all subsequent proposed actions to the commission for consistency review until the local
17 agency's plan is revised to be consistent with the commissions airport plan or the local agency
18 overrules the commission's determination inconsistency.
19 78. Section 21676.5 further provides that if the commission determines that a
20 subsequent proposed action of the local agency is inconsistent with the commission's airport land
21 use compatibility plan, the local agency may overrule the commission's determination of

22 inconsistency by following specified procedures and making "specific findings that the proposed
23 action is consistent with the purposes of this [Article 3.5] as stated in Section 21670."
24 79. Section 21670, subdivision (a)(2) provides as follows: "It is the purpose of this
25 article to protect public health, safety, and welfare by ensuring the orderly expansion of airports
26 and the adoption of land use measures that minimize the public's exposure to excessive noise and
27 safety hazards within areas around public airports to the extent that these areas are not already
28 devoted to incompatible uses."

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECI ARATONV DEIIFR 16

- 80. SMUD is a local agency for purposes of Section 21676.5.

2 81.

3 The airspace around Travis AFB that is traversed by military and civilian aircraft

4 and is monitored by the Travis AFB air traffic control radar is an area around a public airport that
is not already devoted to incompatible use for purposes of Section 21670.

5 82.

6 The increase in risk that aircraft within the airspace around Travis AFB might
collide with each other due to increased interference with Travis AFB's air traffic control radar is

7 a safety hazard for purposes of Section 21670.

8 83.

9 Whether that safety hazard is excessive, for purposes of Section 21670, depends
on both the increase in magnitude of the risk of collision at any point in time as well as the

10 increase in duration of that risk over time.

11 84.

12 On August 19, 2021, through its Resolution No. 21-08-05, SMUD's governing

13 board unanimously adopted findings and a decision overruling the ALUC's determination that the
Project was inconsistent with the ALUC's Travis AFB LUCP.

14 85.

15 86. These finding and decision are not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

16 SMUD's finding that the Project will not cause an excessive safety hazard within

17 the area around Travis AFB is based on evidence of the percentage decrease in probability of

18 detection (Pd) that will be experienced by Travis AFB's air traffic control radar because of the

19 Project, relative to existing conditions. This finding relies on probability of detection as a proxy

20 for risk of collision without providing any evidentiary basis for making such an implied
correlation.

21 87.

22 This evidence of the percentage decrease in probability of detection that will be

23 experienced by Travis AFB's air traffic control radar because of the Project assumes that the

24 existing Solano Wind Phase 1 Project would continue to exist-and would continue to interfere
with Travis AFB's air traffic control radar-indefinitely rather than be decommissioned and
25

26 removed if that existing project was not replace or "repowered" with the Solano 4 Wind Project.

27 There is no evidence in the record to support such an assumption. There is no evidence in the

28 record regarding how the probability of detection would increase or decrease, or how the risk of
aircraft collision would increase or decrease, if the existing Solano Wind Phase 1 Project is 1

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF 17

I removed from the Solano 4 East site as is reasonably expected at end-of-life-which will occur
2 regardless of any action taken by SMUD on the Solano 4 Wind Project-and is not replaced or
3 "repowered" with a new wind project.

4 88. SMUD's finding that the Project will not cause an excessive safety hazard within

5 the area around Travis AFB is based on an assumption that all aircraft traversing the airspace
6 around Travis AFB are be equipped with transponders that are turned on while flying through that
7 airspace, but this assumption is not based on any evidence indicating that it is in fact a valid
8 assumption.

9 89. The record contains substantial evidence that the Project would interfere with
10 Travis AFB's air traffic control radar to some extent and that this interference would constitute a
11 safety hazard within the area around Travis AFB. SMUD's findings fail to evaluate or consider
12 such evidence in the record that fairly detracts from the evidence relied on by SMUD to support
13 its decision.

14 90. As a result of the foregoing defects, SMUD prejudicially abused its discretion.
15 HIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (Pub. Util. Code, § 21676.5; Code Civ. Proc., § 1060)
17 91. COUNTY hereby realleges and incorporates the allegations set forth in paragraphs
18 through 90, above.

19 92. Public Utilities Code section 21671.5, subdivision (f), requires COUNTY to
20 provide the ALUC with staff assistance, including the mailing of notices, the keeping of minutes,
21 necessary quarters, equipment, and supplies. Further, subdivision (f) provides that the usual and
22 necessary operating expenses of the ALUC shall be a COUNTY charge.
23 93. COUNTY does not have authority to pay for activities undertaken by the ALUC
24 that are outside of the ALUC's jurisdiction. Specifically, COUNTY does not have authority to
25 pay for the ALUC to give advisory opinions on matters outside of the ALUC's jurisdiction.
26 94. COUNTY interprets Public Utilities Code section 21676.5 as giving the ALUC
27 jurisdiction to review SMUD's Solano 4 Wind Project, based on the facts alleged herein, and
28 County has incurred costs paying for the ALUC's review of the Project.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY REI.IEF 19

1 95. SMUD interprets Public Utilities Code section 21676.5 as not giving the ALUC

2 jurisdiction to review SMUD's Solano 4 Wind Project, either due to federal preemption or for
3 other reasons.

4 96. An actual controversy exists between COUNTY and SMUD regarding the

5 ALUC's jurisdiction to review SMUD's Solano 4 Wind Project for consistency with the Travis
6 AFB LUCP, including the extent of COUNTY's authority to pay for the ALUC's expenses of
7 conducting such a review.

8 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

9 (Approval of Project based on an improperly certified EIR - Pub. Res. Code, § 21168)
10 97. COUNTY hereby realleges and incorporates the allegations set forth in paragraphs
11 I through 96, above.

12 98. Section 15090, subdivision (a) of the State CEQA Guidelines (Cal. Code. Reg., tit.
13 14, § 15000 et seq.) provides as follows:

14 Prior to approving project the lead agency shall certify that:
15 (1) The final EIR has been completed in compliance with CEQA;
16 (2) The final EIR was presented to the decision-making body of the lead
17 agency, and that the decision-making body reviewed and considered the
18 information contained in the final EIR prior to approving the project; and
19 (3) The final EIR reflects the lead agency's independent judgment and
20 analysis.

21 99. On August 19, 2021, through its Resolution No. 21-08-05, SMUD's governing
22 board voted unanimously to approve the Project.

23 100. As part of its Resolution No. 21-08-05, SMUD's governing board stated that it had
24 reviewed and considered the information in the Solano 4 Wind Project Final Environmental
25 Impact Report and certified that the Project FEIR complies with CEQA.
26 101. SMUD's governing board did not certify that the Project EIR reflects SMUD's
27 independent judgment and analysis.

103.

through 102, above.

8 104. COUNTY hereby realleges and incorporates the allegations set forth in paragraphs

10 CEQA is designed to ensure that he long-term protection of the environment be the

11 guiding criterion in public agency decisions. CEQA requires the lead agency for project with

12 the potential to cause significant environmental impacts to prepare an EIR that complies with the

13 requirements of the statute, including but not limited to the requirement to analyze the project's

14 potentially significant environmental impacts. The EIR must provide sufficient environmental

15 analysis such that the decision-makers can intelligently consider environmental consequences

16 when acting on the proposed project. The EIR must also analyze feasible mitigation measures
and a reasonable range of alternatives to the project.

105.

17

18 If any of the project's significant impacts cannot be reduced to a less than

19 significant level, CEQA bars the lead agency from approving the project if a feasible alternative

20 would meet the project's objectives while avoiding or reducing its significant environmental
impacts. If there is an environmentally superior alternative, the lead

21 that alternative or make formal findings, supported by substantial evidence, that the alternative is
infeasible. agency must either select

22 106.

23

24 Project objectives are closely tied to the evaluation of alternatives in the EIR. The
EIR's statement of project objectives should include the underlying purpose of the project. The
lead

25

26 agency may not give a project's purpose an artificially narrow definition, thereby
unreasonably limiting the range of project alternatives evaluated in the EIR.

107.

27

28 CEQA further prohibits a lead agency from approving project with significant
environmental effect unless it has made written findings for each of those effects, accompanied
by an explanation of the rationale for each finding. These findings must support the ultimate

P decision, be based on substantial evidence in the record, and trace the analytic route between the
2 evidence in the record and the agency's conclusions.

3 108. SMUD violated CEQA by attempting to certify an EIR for the Project that is
inadequate and files to comply with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. Deficiencies in the EIR

5 include, but are not limited to:

6 a. Failure to adequately analyze the Project's impacts to navigable airspace and to

propose 7 air traffic control radar, including duration of impacts, and to
8 mitigation measures that could reduce these impacts a to a less than significant
9 level.

10 b. Failure to adequately analyze and compare a reasonable range of potentially
11 feasible project alternatives, including use of photovoltaic solar, that would
12 foster informed decision making and public participation.
13 C. Use of impermissibly narrow project objects and improper rejection of feasible
14 alternatives that would achieve the underlying purpose of the project and
15 feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project.
16 109. As a result of the foregoing defects, SMUD prejudicially abused its discretion by
17 approving the Project based on an EIR that does not comply with the requirements of CEQA and
18 the CEQA Guidelines, by failing to proceed in the manner required by law, and by failing to act
19 on the basis of substantial evidence.

23 Resolution No. 21-08-05 and, if SMUD should decide to continue pursuing the Project, either to
24 make findings as described in Government Code section 53096 that are supported by substantial
25 evidence in the record or to comply with COUNTY's zoning ordinances in connection with the
26 Project.

27 2. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing SMUD to vacate and set aside its
