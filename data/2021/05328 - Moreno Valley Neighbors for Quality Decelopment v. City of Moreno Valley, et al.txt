VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Petitioner, MORENO VALLEY NEIGHBORS FOR QUALITY DEVELOPMENT
2 ("Petitioner"), alleges through this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate (*Petition"), as follows:
INTRODUCTION

1. Petitioner challenges the adoption by Respondent City of Moreno Valley ("City"
or "Respondent") of two Mitigated Negative Declaration and related discretionary approvals
6 (together, the "Project Approvals") for the proposed developments known as "Iris Park" and the
"The District" ("Project"). As noted below, the City failed to follow the required procedures
8 required by the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") when it adopted it the two
Mitigated Negative Declarations for the Project. The failure to follow these procedures was

10 prejudicial in that it precluded informed decision-making. Morcover, implementation of the

11 Project will have substantial adverse impacts on the environment. 8 Channel Law Group, d1 LIZ06 Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the

8 euns "pAla eulysI!M €8€8 12 2.

13 Project Approvals considered by Respondent, including rescinding any authorizations to proceed
SIl!H Auereg 14 with construction. The City Council for the City of Moreno Valley certified two separate
15| Mitigated Negative Declarations for the Project on February 2, 2021. The City Council also
16 approved a variety of entitlements including a General Plan Amendment, Specific Plan
17 Amendment and Plot Plan. Petitioner requests that the Court vacate the Project Approvals
18 because Respondent failed to comply with the provisions set forth under the California

19 Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA"), and
20 therefore failed to proceed a in a manner required by law.
21 3. Petitioner seeks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under California Code of Civil
22 Procedure section 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate, rescind and set aside all Project
23 Approvals and the environmental determination because Respondent failed to comply with
24| CEQA.

environment in the City of Moreno Valley. Petitioner and its respective members have a direct

5 and substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondent complies with laws relating to
6 environmental protection. Petitioner and its respective members are adversely affected by
7 Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA in approving the Project. Petitioner has standing to
8 assert the claims raised in this Petition because Petitioner and its members' aesthetic and

9 environmental interests are directly and adversely affected by Respondent's' approval of the
10 Project.

PROJECT

10 13. Iris Park is a proposed 81-unit single family development project located on lris
11 Avenue east of Perris Boulevard, and Project 2, The District Moreno Valley, a 220,390 square ® Channel Law Group, d77 L1Z06 12 foot light industrial building development project located on the southeast corner of Heacock
13
8 EUNS "PAS BJJySIM €8C8 Street and Ironwood Avenue. In order to facilitate the development, the applicant sought
'SI!H Aueneg 14 approval of a General Plan Amendment, Change of Zone, Tentative Tract Map 37909, and
15 Conditional Use Permit for a residential Planned Unit Development.
16 14. Iris Park is proposed to be located on an approximately 10.82-acre site on the
17 south side of Iris Avenue east of Perris Boulevard. The parcel is triangular in shape with the
18 larger portion fronting Iris Avenue and narrowing to the south. All properties to the north and

19 east are zoned Residential 5 (R5) District with existing single family residential units. Directly
20 south is an existing elementary school with small lot subdivisions further south. The westerly
21 portion of the site on the diagonal is the 100-foot State of California Aqueduct easement which is
22 the future location of the City's Juan Bautista de Anza Aqueduct Bike Trail.
23 15. The District is a proposed 220,390 light industrial building for a property located
24 at the southeast corner of Ironwood Avenue and Heacock Street. In order to facilitate the
25 development, the applicant requested approval of the following: a General Plan Amendment
26 (PEN20-0139) to amend the General Plan land use designation from Commercial (C) to Business
27

1 Park (BP); a Specific Plan Amendment (PEN20-0138) to amend the Specific Plan 205 land use
2 designation from Retail Commercial (R/C) to Mixed Uses (MU); and a Plot Plan.
3 16. The District is located on an approximately 9.96-acre site on located on the
4 southeast corner of Heacock Street and Ironwood Avenue. The surrounding area includes

existing single-family homes and an electrical substation to the north across Ironwood Avenue
on property zoned Residential (R5) District; light industrial buildings currently under
7 construction on properties located within Specific Plan 205 to the south and east; and a mix of
8 existing single-family homes, offices, and commercial businesses to the west within the
Neighborhood Commercial (NC) District and the Office Commercial (OC) District.

10 17. The processed a single General Plan Amendment for the Project. However, the

11 City processed two separate Mitigated Negative Declarations for the Project - one for the "Iris
90211 12 Park" development and one for "'The District" development. An Initial Study/Mitigated
8 OS49 p eUNS "PAJE EJJUSUM E8E8 13 Negative Declaration was prepared by Blodgett Baylosis Environmental Planning for the "Iris
SIIIH AueAeg 14 Park" development. An Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration was prepared by EPD
15 Solutions, Inc. for "The District."
16

17 PROJECT BACKGROUND, ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL

18 18. The Planning Commission held a public hearing on December 10, 2020 to
19 consider the "Iris Park" development. The Planning Commission voted to recommend approval
20 of the requested entitlements and the Mitigated Negative Declaration.
21 19. The Planning Commission held a public hearing on January 14, 2021 to consider
22 "The District' development. The Planning Commission voted to recommend approval of the
23 requested entitlements and the Mitigated Negative Declaration.

24 20. Thereafter, the City Council held a public hcaring on February 2, 2021 to consider
25 the entire Project. Petitioner submitted an extensive comment letter objecting to the Project
26 explaining, among other things, that the City was engaged in unlawful piecemcaling. The City
27

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 nonetheless approved the Project and certified the two Mitigated Negative Declarations.
2 21. The City filed two Notice of Determinations with the County Recorder on
3 February 5, 2021. The City filed one Notice of Determination for "Iris Park" and another Notice

4 of Determination for "The District." This action has been brought within 30 days of the filing of
5 the Notices of Determination with the County Recorder.
6 CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

22. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public
8 agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental

9 implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the

10 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
11
8 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires d77 'dnoJo ME7 jeuueuo 90211 BINS "pAE EUJUSIM €888 12 governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects

8 13 of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
SIIH Áueseg 14 otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with
15 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
16 23. CEQA is California's broadest environmental law and helps to guide public
17 agencies such as the City during issuance of permits and approval of projects. Courts have
18 interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest protection of the environment within the reasonable scope
19 of the statutes. CEQA applies to all discretionary projects proposed to be conducted or approved
20 by a City, including private projects requiring discretionary government approval. Sec California
21 Public Resources Code, sections 21000 - 21178, and Title 14 Cal. Code Regs., section 753, and
22 Chapter 3, sections 15000 - 15387.
23 24. A strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an Environmental
24 Impact Report ("EIR") is built into CEQA which is reflected in what is known as the "fair
25 argument" standard, under which an agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence
26 1n the record supports a fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the

23 27. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
24 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
25 28. Project Description Errors: The Projects lacks an accurate and stable project
26 description. The lack of an accurate and stable project description is evidenced by the difference

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 between how "The District" is described in the Mitigated Negative Declaration and how it is
2

3 described in the City's Agenda, staff report, and resolutions. It is also reflected in the fact that

5 the project described in the technical studies included in Appendices A, C, D, E and F to the
4 Mitigated Negative Declaration are for an earlier 2018 First Amendment to the Specific Plan,

6 which did not include the proposed project site.

29.

8 Project Splitting. The City also engaged in piecemealing, which is unlawful. The
7 California Environmental Quality Act precludes the splitting of a project into pieces for purposes

10 of minimizing its environmental effects. Here, the City has improperly split the General Plan
Amendment into two pieces, and prepared separate environmental documents for the residential

0344 90211 SIl!H ÁueAeg sssa vlshirg BlVA Su2a 12 and warehouse/light industrial components. This is a violation of CEQA, which requires
11 analysis of the whole of the action.

Channel Law Group, 30. Inadequate Notice. The public comment period for the Notice of Availability for
13 the Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration for "The District" development began on
14| December 23, 2020 and ended on January 11, 2021. It was thus circulated for 20 days, and those

16 15 20 days included both Christmas and New Year's Day. The MND was not posted on the City's

18 website, the Project was not listed on the City's website as a current project, and the proposed
17| Specific Plan Amendment was not listed or provided on the City's website thus further reducing

20 the likelihood that members of the public would find or comment on the MND for the proposed
19 project. Moreover, the MND was not sent to the State Clearinghouse. In this case, the Project is

21

22 of regional or areawide significance, since it involves both a General Plan a and Specific Plan
Amendment. The Project is located in close proximity to State Route 60, and the Project thus

24 has the potential to add traffic and impact a facility under Caltrans control. Although no site-
23 specific biological resource report was prepared for the project site, and the MND instead relied

25 on the studies prepared for the remainder of the Specific Plan area, those studies do indicate that

27 the project site is within the Western Riverside County Multiple Specics Habitat Conservation
26 Plan (MSHCP) area, and that there is the potential for sensitive species on the project site.

28 8

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Further, based on the Jurisdictional Delineation Report (2015) there are likely to be Waters of the
2 United States located on the project site. The MND thus needed to be sent to the State 1

3 Clearinghouse for review by applicable State agencies. The City failed to follow CEQA's
4 noticing mandates.

5 Mitigated Negative Declaration Fundamentally Inadequate. In this case, the
environmental clearance document prepared for "The District" development is fundamentally 31,

7 inadequate. The technical studies included in Appendices A, C, D, E and F to F the MND are for 6

8 the earlier 2018 Amendment to the Specific Plan, which did not include the proposed project
9 site. Further, the residential project included in the Resolution for the General Plan Amendment

10 included the following technical studies, which were not prepared for the proposed project: a
11 CalEEMod Emissions Summary; Habitat Assessment; Phase I Cultural Resources Assessment; 8 d77 dnoJg MET |ouueyc LIZ06 12 eyns "pAja euJys|!M €8g8 Phase I Paleontological Resources Assessment; Preliminary Geotechnical and Infiltration
13 Feasibility Investigation; Phase I Environmental Site Assessment; Preliminary Hydrology 8
SIl!H Aueneg 14 Report; Preliminary Project Specific Water Quality Management Plan; Noise Impact Analysis;
15 Trip Generation Analysis; VMT Memo. The MND is thus so fundamentally and basically
16 inadequate and conclusory in nature that meaningful public review and comment were
17 precluded.
18 32. Project Will Have Significant Unmitigable Environmental Impacts. The
19 Conclusions in the Mitigated Negative Declaration for The District are not supported by

21 following environmental resource categories: (1) Air Quality, (2) Biological Resources, (3) 20 substantial evidence. Instead, substantial evidence supports the potential for impacts to the

22 Hydrology, (4) Noise, (5) Traffic, and (6) Utilities and Service Systems.
23 33. Air Quality Impacts. The Air Quality Worksheets included in Appendix A of the
24 MND are for the Koala Road Greenhouses and Commercial Center in the Mojave Desert AQMD
Air District, not the Project, which is located in Riverside County, which is in the Southcoast Air
26 Quality Management District (SCAQMD). The conclusions in the MND regarding project air 25

9 27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 emissions are therefore not supported by substantial evidence. In the absence of an accurate and
2 complete air quality analysis, the potential for impacts remains.
3 34. As noted in the MND, the entire Specific Plan Area is located in a non-attainment
area for ozone and particulates. In the absence of a showing to the contrary, the potential for the
5 project to exacerbate non-attachment or delay attainment remains.

6 35. The MND fails to address the project's consistency with employment growth
7 projections used in the Air Quality Management Plan in any meaningful way. Therefore, the
8 potential for impacts remains. The MND fails to provide substantial evidence that would support
conclusion that air quality and AQMP consistency impacts are less than significant.

10 36. The proposed warehouse/logistics facility is located in close proximity to

11 residential uses. Homes are located across the street to the west and north of the project site. 8 d77 *dnoJo ME jauBuo 14Z06 euns "pAla eIJuSIIM €8€8 The MND fails to include an air toxics analysis and air dispersion modeling to determine the
13 potential for localized air quality impacts. Given the nature of the proposed project, likely truck 12

8
SIl!H AUeAe8 14 traffic, and the proximity to residential uses, the potential for localized air quality impact
15 remains.

17 biological resource information for the area included in the existing Specific Plan. Neither 16 37. Biological Resources Impacts. The MND contains three technical appendices with

18| Appendix C - General Biological Assessment Report, Moreno Valley Festival, City of Moreno
19 Valley, California, prepared by Hernandez Environmental Services, November 2015 or
Moreno Valley Festival, prepared by 20 Appendix D - Jurisdictional Delineation Report for the
Hernandez Environmental Services, November 2015, address the project site. Only the existing
22 49-acre Specific Plan area was surveyed. No site-specific biological resource assessment 21

23 appears to have been conducted for the project site. According to Appendix C, the following
24 sensitive species have the potential to occur on adjacent portions of the Specific Plan area, or
25 appropriate habitat is present on the existing Specific Plan site: (1) San Bernardino Aster, (2)
26 Cooper's Hawk, (3) Bell's Sage Sparrow, (4) Orange-throat Whiptail, (5) Coastal Whiptail, (6)

1 Red-diamond Rattlesnake, (7) California Horned Lark, (8) Western Yellow Bat, (9) San Diego
2 Black-tailed Jackrabbit, (10) Coast Horned Lizard and (10) Lawrence's Goldfinch. It is therefore
likely that these species may occur on the project site. In addition, the Biological Resource
4 Study included in MND Appendix C, also found that suitable habitat for Burrowing Owls was 3

present on the existing Specific Plan site, although no Burrowing Owls were observed. No

6 Burrowing Owl survey has been conducted for the project site. In the absence of a site-specific
7 Biological Resource Assessment, there is the potential for impacts to these sensitive species.

8 38. The technical studies included as appendices to the MND provide substantial
evidence of the project's potential to result in significant impacts to sensitive species, to alter a

10 streambed and to result in impacts Waters of the United States. In the absence of a current, site

11 specific Biological Resource Assessment and Jurisdictional Delineation to the contrary, the 8 d77 dnoJg ME jeuueus •1706 12 technical appendices to the MND provide substantial evidence of the potential for impacts. The

8 ens "paja eujys!!M €8€8 13 MND at page 48 includes the several biological resource mitigation measures which are both a
'SlH Apereg 14 combination of deferred analysis and deferred mitigation. For cxample, Mitigation Mcasure 2
15 requires a Burrowing Owl survey prior to construction, yet no site-specific survey was conducted
for Burrowing Owls as part of the preparation of the MND. According to Appendix C, the
17 Riverside County Transportation and Land Management (TLMA) requires a habitat assessment 16

18 for Burrowing Owls yet this was not done as part of preparation of the MND. Further,
Mitigation Measure 3 requires consultation with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife,
20 the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board, 19

21 yet the MND was not sent to the State Clearinghouse to allow for review by these responsible
22 agencies.

Planning Area along the west side of Heacock Street. As shown in Table 3-4 from the MND,

6 existing noise levels exceed residential standards which are a maximum permitted noise level of
60 dBA during day-time hours and 55 dBA for evening hours. The MND assumes that because
8 the proposed project will not result in a doubling of traffic that no significant noise impacts will
occur. However, the MND fails to address the project's potential to contribute to cumulative
10 noise impacts, and does not contain a proper noise analysis prepared by a noise expert. The
11 potential for significant cumulative noise impacts remains. 8 d71 Channel Law Group, LLZ06 12 41. Traffic Impacts. A Transportation Impact Analysis (TIA) that complies with the

8 eynS "pAla eJJySIIM €8€8 13 City's Transportation Impact Analysis Preparation Guide for Vehicle Miles Traveled and Level
'SIl!H Áueneg 14 of Service Assessment (June 2020) (TIA Guide) was not prepared for the Project. Although the
15 MND does not include TIA for the project, it does include a number of mitigation measures. It
16 is unclear if these are project specific. It appears more likely that these are the mitigations that
17 were identified in the TIA for the 2018 First Amendment to the Specific Plan. Although the
18 Project would generate less than 100 peak hour trips, based on Business Park trip generation, the
19 trip generation estimate in the MND does not take account of the truck intensive nature of the
20 Project. With application of a PCE factor, the project's 93 PM peak hour trips would exceed the

4 any utilities or service system improvements required for the Project and any modifications to
5 the infrastructure sections of the existing Specific Plan to address the addition of the proposed
6 project and project site. As a result, both the MND impact analysis and the project description
7 are deficient.

8 43. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion

Amendment PEN20-0138; Plot Plan PEN20-0137-0139

To Whom It May Concern:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under California Public Resources Code section 21167.5, that Petitioner, Moreno Valley Neighbors for Quality Development, intends to immediately file a Petition
for Writ of Mandate ("Petition") under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), inter alia, against the City of Moreno Valley ("City") and Real Party in Interest Passco Pacifica LLC and LCG 10MV, LLC. The Petition will be filed in Riverside County Superior Court and will allege, inter alia, that the City failed to comply with CEQA when it adopted two Mitigated Negative Declarations for the proposed developments known as "Iris Park" and the "The District" ("Project"). "Iris Park" is a proposed 81-unit single family residential project located on Iris Avenue East of Perris Boulevard in Moreno Valley, California. "The District" is a proposed 220,390 square foot light industrial building located on the southeast corner of Heacock Street and Ironwood Avenue
in Moreno Valley, California. Among other things, Petitioner contends that the City of Moreno Valley ("City') processed two separate Mitigated Negative Declarations for the Project in violation of the California Environmental Quality Act's ("CEQA") anti-piecemealing mandate. The Project is also not eligible for a Mitigated Negative Declaration due to the significant environmental effects associated with the Project which cannot be mitigated.
