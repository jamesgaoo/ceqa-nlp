Petitioner JEFF BORNSTEIN, Petitioner LUIS MOLINA and Petitioner UNITE HERE
2 LOCAL 11 (collectively referred to as "Petitioner"), alleges through this Verified Petition for 1

3 Writ of Mandate ("Petition"), as follows:
INTRODUCTION 4

5 1. Petitioner challenges the adoption by Respondent City of Los Angeles ("City" or
6 "Respondent") of the Mitigated Negative Declaration (*MND"), and the related discretionary

7 approvals (together, the "Project Approvals") for the proposed mixed us development project
8 located at 20920 - 20970 West Warner Center Lane, 20935 -21051 West Warner Center Lane
and 20931 - 21041 West Burbank Boulevard ("Project"). As noted below, the City failed to
10 follow the required procedures required by the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA")

11 when it adopted the MND for the Project. The failure to follow these procedures was prejudicial 8 d77 'dnoJo MeT |euueua LLZ06 1A08V  E SIN A EO CE 12 in that it precluded informed decision-making. Moreover, implementation of the Project will
13 have substantial adverse impacts on the environment. The City also failed to comply with the
'SIIH AuBAeE 14 Warner Center 2035 Specific Plan when it approved the Project.
Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the
16 Project Approvals considered by Respondent, including rescinding any authorizations to proceed 15 2.

17 with construction. The Los Angeles City Council certified the MND for the Project on April 20,
18 2021. The City Council also approved entitlements for the Project. Petitioner requests that the

19 Court vacate the Project Approvals because Respondent failed to comply with the provisions set
20 forth under the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000, et

21 seq. ("CEQA"), and therefore failed to proceed a in a manner required by law. The City also failed
22 to comply with the Warner Center 2035 Specific Plan when it approved the Project.

3. Petitioner seeks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under California Code of Civil
rescind and set aside all Project 23

24 Procedure section 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate,
25 Approvals and the environmental determination because Respondent failed to comply with
26 CEQA and applicable zoning law.

PROJECT 1

2 14. The Project is described by the City in the Staff Report to the Planning
3 Commission as follows: "The proposed Project includes the demolition of 340,339 square feet
4 of 12 one-, two,- and three- story office buildings, as well as the phased construction of ten new
5 buildings, which include a total of up to 2,634,268 square feet of residential and commercial

6 floor area, including a total of up to 1,009 multi-family residential units, including 841 apartment

7 units (53 of which will be Work-Live Units, as defined in Section 5 of the WC 5 2035 Plan) and
8 168 condominium units (15 of which will be Work- Live Units), 228 hotel rooms, 1,140,746

10 of ground-floor retail space, 35,311 square feet of ground-floor restaurant and/or retail space,
11 26,762 square feet of ground-floor office and/or retail space, and 4,068 square feet of community 8 Channel Law dnoJg d77 IZO6 12 space. The new buildings vary in height, from 35 feet (2 stories) to 350 feet (24 stories). The
13 8 eing "pAjE BJJYS|IM €888 proposed Project also includes a total of 5,548 parking spaces. The Project proposes building in
Hills, Aueseg 14 eight phases."
15 15. The Project Site is located at 20920 - 20970 West Warner Center Lane, 20935 -
16 21051 West Warner Center Lane and 20931 - 21041 West Burbank Boulevard in the City of Los

17 Angeles. The Project Site is an irregular-shaped, generally level parcel of land with a current lot
18 area of 1,062,923 square feet (24.40 acres). The Project Site provides 1,019 feet of linear
19 frontage along De Soto Avenue and 1,184 feet of linear frontage along Burbank Boulevard.
20 Street dedications are anticipated to be required on the Project Site along De Soto Avenue and
21 Burbank Boulevard, which would reduce the lot area to 1,042,301 square feet (23.92 acres).
22 16. The Project Site is currently improved with 12 existing buildings, which include
23 340,339 square feet of floor area, and associated surface parking. Warner Center Lane, an
24| existing private street which is 64 feet in width, currently runs through the Project Site between
25 De Soto Avenue and Burbank Boulevard. The existing buildings predominantly include office

16 19. The entitlement cases, DIR-2017-1708-SPP and VTT-74891, were filed April 27,
is 17 2017. The proposed Project is subject to Specific Plan procedures because it is located with the
18 boundaries of the Warner Center 2035 Specific Plan. The WC2035 Plan became effective
19 December 25, 2013. An EIR for WC2035 was prepared. The Final Environmental Impact
20 Report for the WC2035 Plan (ENV-2008-3471-EIR; SCH No. 1990011055 was certified by the
21 Los Angeles City Council on October 23, 2013 (WC2035 Plan FEIR) (Council File No. 13-
22|0197). The MND for the proposed project is tiered off of this 8-year-old FEIR.
23 20. On March 23, 2020, the Director of Planning and Deputy Advisory Agency issued
24 Letters of Determination approving the Project, subject to Conditions of Approval.
25 21. On April 2, 2020, two appeals were filed by the City of Los Angeles. Thereafter,

CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental
4LZ06 d17 'dnoJ9 MET jeuueuy 12 implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the 11
8

8 eyn$ "PALE BJJUSIIM €888 13 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
'SIIH Aueneg 14 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires
15 governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects
16 of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
17 otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with
18 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
CEQA is California's broadest environmental law and helps to guide public 19 24.

1 Impact Report ("EIR") is built into CEQA which is reflected in what is known as the "fair

environment. No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75, 82; Friends of "B" St.

8 and enhance the environmental quality of the state.' [Citation.] The EIR is therefore 'the heart of

16 "a substantial or potentially substantial adverse change in the environment." PRC §21068; 14 Cal

FIRST USE OF ACTION

(VIOLATION OF CEQA)

28. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
4 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

5 29. The City prepared a Mitigated Negative Declaration for this large-scale Master

6 Plan project and tiered that MND off an eight-year-old EIR for Warner Center 2035 (WC2035)

7 Plan area. In tiering off the EIR, the City failed to address whether there are changes in
8 circumstances or new information that has become available since the preparation of the

9 WC2035 EIR, that would result in new or more severe impacts from this proposed project and
10 the Warner Center 2035 Plan. The City has tiered off the EIR for the WC2035 Plan despite the
11 fact that the proposed project would be built in eight phases and would not be completed until
LLZ06 09Z GUNS "PALE BULYS|IM E8E8 d11'dnoJs MET |3uueYo 12 2035 and should thus itself be the subject of a Program EIR. The proposed project is not eligible
13
8 for an MND because it would result in significant impacts, which the MND has either not
SIl!H Auareg 14 addressed or has not adequately mitigated.
15 30. In addition, the MND has not met the conditions for use of an MND as specified
16 in CEQA Guidelines Section 15070. When a subsequent environmental document is tiered from
17 a Program EIR such as the WC2035 EIR, pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15152(f): "A
18 later EIR shall be required when the initial study or other analysis finds that the later project may

19 cause significant effects on the environment that were not adequately addressed in the prior EIR.
20 A negative declaration shall be required when the provisions of Section 15070 are met." The
21 MND documents that the proposed project will have a number of significant impacts. The MND
22 classifies most of these impacts as less than significant with mitigation, but the checklist lists
23 certain issues as potentially significant, rather than less than significant. Furthermore, the
24 narrative of the MND identifies certain issues as significant and unavoidable, in conflict with the
25 determination in the checklist portion of the MND. These mitigation measures are essentially
26 WC2035 EIR mitigation measures applied to the project. However, no Mitigation Measures are
27

9 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 provided to address the significant GHG impacts. The MND instead relies on the fact that the
2 WC2035 FEIR identified significant unavoidable GHG impacts. In terms of the Mitigation
3 Measures provided, the MND fails to demonstrate that these mitigation measures would reduce
significant impacts to a point where clearly no significant effects would occur as required by

5 CEQA Guidelines Section 15070(b). Other mitigation measures are so vague, as to render them

6 useless, as it would be impossible to decern whether the project sponsor was in conformance, or

7 to assess their mitigation value and efficacy as they lack performance standards. Further,

8 compliance with several of the mitigation measures may require construction of public services

9 and facilities, which are not described or analyzed in the MND or WC2035 EIR. In the case of
10| Measure U-10 the City's Urban Water Management Plan (UWMP) is out of date and is not in
11 compliance with state law which required five-year up-dates, as the City is still using the 2015 0949 LIZ06 euns "palg auIlusI!M €8C8 12 UWMP. The efficacy of the mitigation measure is thus questionable. Moreover, mitigation
but defers analysis of potential impacts, and as written, is a MEl jouueyo Group, 8 13 Measure PS-11 is not only vague,
SI!H Áuereg 14 case of improper deferral of mitigation. Also, measures such as U-10 and PS-11 raise the
15 potential for the need for additional public service facilities and construction which may result in
16 off-site impacts that have not been addressed in either the WC2035 EIR or the MND for the
17 proposed project. The potential for significant impacts from compliance with these mitigation
18 measures remains. Given the vagueness of these mitigation measures and lack of performance
19 standards, the CEQA Guidelines Section 15070(b)(1) condition for use of an MND, that
20 mitigations "would avoid the effects or mitigate the effects to a point where clearly no
21  significant effects would occur" has not been met. An EIR is required for the proposed project.
22 31. The MND failed to demonstrate that the applicant agreed to the mitigation
23 measures before the MND was circulated for public review. The City is not requiring such
24 agreement until prior to the recordation of the final map. This is clear from Condition of
25 Approval 39. Thus, the subdivider (project applicant) was not required to agree to the mitigation
26 measures specified in the MND prior to release of the MND for public review, as required for
27

10 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 use of an MND under CEQA Guidelines Section 15070(b), and is only so required prior to
2 recordation of the final map. This necessary condition for use of an MND for the proposed
3 project has not been met.

4 32. The City also violated CEQA by including a condition of approval in violation of
5 CEQA Guidelines Section 15162. Future phases of the project will require issuance a building
6 permits and discretionary review by the Director of Planning. As such, the City is required by
CEQA Guidelines Section 15162 to determine whether there have been any changes in the
project, changes in circumstances, or new information of substantial importance, that was not
known when the CEQA document for the project was certified or adopted, that would result in
10 new or more severe impacts. However, the City inappropriately in its Conditions of Approval
11
8 exempts future phases of the project from this review. Thus, despite the fact that construction of Channel Law Group, d77 • LZ06 euns "pAIa BJjus|:m €g€g 12 Phase 8, for example, would not start until 2033-2034, twelve years from now, and will require
13 8 issuance of discretionary permits, the City does not plan to do any additional environmental
SIlIH Auereg 14 review on Phases 2-8, or even ask the question as to whether additional review is needed, even
15 though there may be changes in circumstance that occur over the next 2-15 years which could 16 result in new or more severe impacts resulting from the proposed project either alone or in
17 combination with cumulative development. This is a violation of CEQA Guidelines Section
18 15162.

19 33. The proposed project would result in a number of significant unmitigated impacts
20 and is therefore not eligible for an MND. Impacts include those identified in the MND that
21 would remain due to the inadequate nature of a number of mitigation measures as well as
22 impacts which the MND failed to identify. The Project would result in significant unmitigated
23 traffic impacts as explained by Petitioner in its comments letters submitted ot the City in support
24 of the appeal to City Council. Further, the Project would result in significant un-mitigated
25 biological resources impacts as identified by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife,
26 namely, impacts to bats.

1 34. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion
2 by failing to comply with the procedures outlined in the CEQA Guidelines and failing to conduct
3 the adequate environmental review for the Project. Accordingly, Respondent's MND must be set

4 aside.

5 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (VIOLATION OF SPECIFIC PLAN)

7 35. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
8 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
9 36. The Project does not comply with the Warner Center 2035 Specific Plan. The
10 applicant is not constructing a "New Street." Warner Center Lane exists and is fully functional.

MET |euueud 'dnous d77 4IZ06 0gL eUn 'paja EJlys|!M €8€8 11 Satellite imagery available from Google Earth shows that Warner Center Lane has been in
12 physical existence since at least 1989, or more than 30 years. Existing Warner Center Lane has a
on each side of the street 8 13 44-foot roadway width leaving a 10-foot Pedestrian/Sidewalk area
'SIl!H Aueneg 14 within the right-of-way. In addition to the Sidewalk area within the right-of-way, existing
15 Warner Center Lane has a landscape buffer/berm separating the pedestrian area of the Warner
16 Lane right-of-way from the existing parking areas.
17 37, The minor modifications to existing Warner Center Lane mandated by the City do
18 not meet the definition of a "New Street." Per the Section 4 of the WC2035 Plan a new street is

19 defined as:

20 NEW STREETS. To create an enhanced circulation network, the Plan requires
21 creation of additional private streets [i.e., not part of the public streets system) through existing private properties available to all forms of transportation. New 22 Streets shall mean such network of private streets, which are publicly accessible
23 and must intersect the public street system. (Emphasis added).

24 38. Since there is currently a fully functional Warner Center Lane with the same
25 alignment and right-of-way width, the project does not result in the creation of an additional
26 private street.
27

12 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 39. The City's treatment of Warner Center Lane as a "New Street" for purposes of the
2 proposed project defies both common sense and the definition of a "New Street" in the WC2035
3 Plan. No reasonable person would find that the proposed project's version of Warner Center
lane constitutes a new private street. The net result of the City's treatment of Warner Center

5 Lane as a "New Street" is to rob the public of required public open. This is because the proposed
6 project is claiming a 50% reduction in the amount of required Publicly Accessible Open Space
(PAOS) (from 15% to 7.5%) due to the provision of a "New Street", Warner Center Lane, and is
8 only providing 11.66% PAOS.

40. The proposed project is then claiming a benefit to which it is not entitled. This is
10 because the project is claiming an Incentivized Use Credit for which it is not eligible. The
11
8 applicant is claiming an Incentivized Use credit for providing at least 50% more Publicly
Channel Law Group, d17 eWnS "pALa BUIUSIIM €888 90211 12 Accessible Open Space than required (after the 50% open space reduction - i.e. 7.5% x 1.5 =

8 13 11.25% and the project provides 2.79 acres or approximately 11.66% open space). However,
SITH Áuereg 14 since Warner Center Lane is not actually a "New Street" and thus the project is not providing
15 50% more Publicly Accessible Open Space than would actually be required (i.e. it doesn't
16 provide 50% over the original undiscounted 15%), the project should not be eligible for this
17 second Incentivized Use credit. The project thus does not provide the two Incentivized Uses

18 required in order to ascend the Graduated FAR Table for the Commerce District by two steps
19 (see Section 6.1.2.2 of the WC2035 Plan) as explained in Section 6.2.1.2.3 of the WC2035 Plan.
20 The project provides residential FAR in excess of that allowed by the Graduated FAR Table and
21 is thus inconsistent with the requirements of the WC2035 Plan.
22 41. The proposed project is thus inconsistent with both the open space requirements
23 of the WC2035 Plan and is inconsistent with mix of uses requirements in the WC2035 Plan. If
24 the proposed project wants to claim a second Incentivized Use Credit it would need to provide
25 22.5% open space, rather than the 11.66% included on the project plans. The proposed project
26 and the City are short-changing the public by providing substantially less open space than
