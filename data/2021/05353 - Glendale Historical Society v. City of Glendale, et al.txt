Petition for Writ of Mandamus 1

1 Petitioner alleges: Introduction
2

3 1. The Glendale Historical Society (Society) brings this mandamus action in the

4 public interest to enforce mandates of California environmental law. The Society

5 challenges the City of Glendale's refusal to prepare an Environmental Impact Report
6

7 before considering approval of a 12-unit, three-story market-rate residential project.

8 The proposed units would wrap around a 1913 "Aeroplane" Craftsman home,

9 needlessly demolishing character-defining historic features and overwhelming and

10 obscuring the 100-year-old City treasure.

22 Aeroplane Craftsman at 534 N. Kenwood Street
23 Expert fact-based evidence in the record confirms that the project "can be
24

25 expected to cause substantial adverse change to the significance of the historical

26 resource." The City Council refused to consider project revisions to reduce

27 environmental impacts and approved the project on a 3-1 vote based on a Mitigated
28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 2

1 Negative Declaration. The Society and many community members objected to the

2 significant aesthetic impacts of the new construction vis-a-vis the historic resource.

12

13 The project rendering disguises the 17-foot difference in height but nonetheless
14 indicates the size, mass, and proximity of new construction relative to the historic Craftsman.

15
There is ample evidence in the administrative record to support a fair argument 16

17 that the project may have significant adverse environmental impacts related to historic

18 resources and aesthetics.

19 Having exhausted administrative remedies, the Society respectfully requests that
20 this Court issue a peremptory writ in the public interest. The City should be ordered to
21

22 set aside the project approvals and conduct an EIR process before reconsidering the

23 project. The EIR will inform the discretion of the City Council, analyzing significant

24 environmental impacts and identifying feasible mitigation measures and alternatives.

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 3

1 Jurisdiction

2. 2. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code section 21168
3

4 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. The parties and the affected historic

5 resource are within the City of Glendale and the County of Los Angeles.

6

7 Parties

8 3. Petitioner Glendale Historical Society is a California non-profit corporation

q

10 founded in 1979 by a group of residents to promote conservation of Glendale's

11 architectural and cultural heritage. Its members value the historic resources in

12 Glendale, including the Craftsman home at 534 N. Kenwood Street, and continue to

13 advocate for their preservation. The Society and its members believe that historic
14 resources are essential to maintaining and improving Glendale's livability, diversity,
15

16 sustainability, beauty and economic vitality. They bring this petition on behalf of all

17 others similarly situated and too numerous to be named and brought before this Court

18 as petitioners. They objected to the project at public hearings and exhausted their

19 administrative remedies.
20
4.
21 Respondents City of Glendale and its City Council (collectively, the City)

22 is the governmental body that approved the project based on a Mitigated Negative

23 Declaration and acted as lead agency under CEQA. The City participates in the

24 National Park Service's Certified Local Government Program, administered by the
25
California Office of Historic Preservation.
26

27 5. Real party in interest R & A Homes, LLC (the applicant), owns the

28 property at 534 N. Kenwood Street and the adjacent property at 538 N. Kenwood

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 4

1 Street. Real party in interest Hamlet Zohrabians is the project architect. As he is named

2 as the applicant in the City's Notice of Determination, CEQA requires that the Society
name him as a real party in interest. Upon his request, the Society can dismiss Mr.

5 Zohrabians from this action if all parties agree he is not indispensable.

6. Does 1 to 10 are fictitiously-named real parties in interest whose true
names and capacities are currently unknown to the Society. If and when their true

8 names and capacities are known, the Society may amend the petition to assert them.

7.
10 The paragraphs below refer to and rely on information in documents that

11 will be lodged with this Court as part of the record of proceedings and that are here

12 incorporated by reference.

13 General Allegations
14

15 Environmental Setting

16 8. Expert assessment of the entire property at 534 N. Kenwood Street in two

17 City-adopted historic resources surveys - the 2006-2007 City of Glendale
18

19 Reconnaissance Survey and Historic Context Statement of Craftsman Style Architecture

20 and the 2017 South Glendale Historic Resources Survey - resulted in a California

21 Historical Resources Status Code of 5S3. The City acknowledges that the property is a

22 historic resource pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15064.5, subdivision (a).
23
9.
24 The City's neighborhoods east of its downtown are notable for a mix of

25 | housing types, including single-family houses and smaller-scale apartment buildings

26 from the first half of the twentieth century and larger new multi-family developments

27 constructed primarily since the 1970s.
28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 5

1 10. Historically, Glendale was a city of Craftsman houses, especially in South

2 Glendale. No areas of the City retain large concentrations of Craftsman-style buildings.

3 The City gives special consideration to the Craftsman style, including a criterion for
4

5 designation on the Glendale Register of Historic Resources designed to encourage

6 owners to preserve Craftsman houses that might otherwise not be eligible. The pace of

7 escalating demolitions of Craftsman houses to make way for multi-family buildings

8 a was a factor in the City's action to survey its remaining Craftsman houses within
9

10 multi-family zones in 2006-2007.

11 11. Only five of the 521 Craftsmans surveyed were of the Aeroplane subtype

12 and four were found to be historic out of 61 historic Craftsmans identified in the survey

13 area. The survey noted the rarity of the Aeroplane Craftsman sub-type, as simpler and
14

15 more modest designs for working-class and middle-class families were typical in the

16 City. The survey particularly called out the project site at 534 N. Kenwood Street for its

17 "iconic" double front gables, elaborate porch design, and garage.

18

19 Project Description

20 12. The project at 534 - 538 N. Kenwood Street is proposed as three-story,
21 market-rate housing of 11 units that would share a lot with the historic single-family
22

23 Craftsman house, counted as a 12th unit. The project proposes to combine two

24 residential lots of a total 15,000 square feet, developed in 1913 and 1922. The applicant

25 proposes to demolish the detached garage at 534 N. Kenwood Street, featured as an
26 exemplary Craftsman garage in the City's 2006-2007 Craftsman Survey, along with
27

28 most of the rear yard.

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 6

13. The applicant proposes to rehabilitate the Aeroplane Craftsman home,

2 with some alterations. A semi-subterranean garage is to be excavated within feet of the
foundation. A new building that is 17.5' higher than the historic Craftsman (40'-3"
4

5 versus 22'-9") is proposed to be built only ten feet from the Craftsman and five feet

6 closer to the street. After project details were revised based on minor conditions

7 developed at the City's Design Review Board, detailed revised plans were not made

8 available to the public. The Society is informed and believes that the size of the
9

10 proposed new building is roughly 18,000 square feet. Taking up a significant portion of

11 the historic property, the over-sized, massive multi-unit building not only would alter

12 the setting but would wrap around and aesthetically smother the historic Craftsman.

13

14 Administrative Process and Approval

15 14. A 20-day public review period for a proposed CEQA Mitigated Negative
16

17 Declaration (MND) began in May 2019. Comments from the Society and architectural

18 historian Francesca Smith identified problems with the analysis of the historic resource

19 and predicted aesthetic impacts. However, the final MND concluded the project would
20 have no potentially significant environmental impacts.
21
15. The Design Review Board reviewed the project in September 2019 and 22

23 approved it with a 3-1 vote based on the MND. The Society, architectural historian

24 Francesca Smith, and members of the public objected to the size, scale, massing and

25 siting of the proposed new construction, the demolition of the garage and alterations to
26 other character-defining features of the property, the project's failure to meet the 27

28 Secretary of the Interior's Standards, inadequate and inappropriately deferred mitigations,

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 7

1 and failure to consider cumulatively considerable impacts.

2 16. The Society appealed the project approval to the City Council. The Council

3 approved it with a 3-1 vote based on the MND following a public hearing in May 2021.
4

5 The Society offered evidence that the City could not rely on an MND and must prepare

6 an EIR because, inter alia, the record included substantial evidence to support a "fair

7 argument" that the project, despite minor revisions, deferred mitigations and would

8 have a significant impact on a qualified historic resource and cumulatively
9

10 considerable environmental impacts. (E.g., Friends of 'B' Street v. City of Hayward (1980)

11 106 Cal.App.3d 988; CEQA Guidelines [14 Cal. Coded Regs.] §§ 15064 (g); 15065(a)(3)).

12 17. The record also identified significant aesthetic impacts of the new

13 construction that would crowd and tower over the historic home. (Protect Niles v City of

14 Fremont (2018) 25 Cal.App.5th 1129); Georgetown Preservation Society v County of El
15

16 Dorado (2018) 30 Cal.App:5th -358)). The Society proposed modifications to the project

17 including, inter alia, reduced height and increased separation from the resource and

18 setback from the street, and asked for additional mitigation for vibration impacts from

19 semi-subterranean garage excavation, a conditions assessment and detailed
20

21 rehabilitation plan, and mitigation for the loss of the garage if retention were infeasible.

22 18. Among those providing fair argument evidence was Francesca Smith, an

23 architectural historian qualified under the Secretary of the Interior's Professional

24 Qualification Standards. Ms. Smith concluded that "the project would cause impacts to
25

26 the historical resource that are not adequately mitigated to ensure the continued

27 significance" and "would cause substantial adverse change to the main house, its

28 garage and the setting of the historical resource."

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 8

1 19. Public participation was severely restricted at the City Council's virtual

2 zoom hearing. Three minutes before the hearing opened, the Council informed the

3 public that nine callers were already in the queue to speak and that the number of total

5 callers would likely be limited to 12. The 12-caller limit was imposed four minutes later

6 despite a light agenda. The requests of many members of the public that phoned in to

7 speak were denied, despite objections raised to the Council during the hearing.

8 20. The City filed a Notice of Determination on May 11, 2021.
9
21.
10 The Society has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary

11 course of law. Issuance of a peremptory writ is imperative to avoid significant
12 environmental impacts. The City has the capacity to correct its violations of law but has

13 failed and refused to do so.

14

15 Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act
16
22.
17 The Society incorporates all paragraphs as if fully set forth.

18 23. The City abused its discretion and failed to act in the manner required by

19 law in approving the project at 534 - 538 N. Kenwood St. based on a Mitigated
20 Negative Declaration. According to proof following certification of the record of
21

22 | proceedings:

23 a. The City unlawfully approved a project with potentially significant

24 environmental impacts without preparing an EIR to inform its discretion. The

25 record contains substantial evidence supporting a fair argument of potentially
26

27 significant environmental impacts, including, inter alia, impacts relating to

28 aesthetics/ visual impacts / historic resources.

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 9

•

1 b. The City failed to make CEQA findings and its refusal to prepare an EIR is not

2 based on findings supported by substantial evidence in the record.

3

4 WHEREFORE, petitioner prays:

5 1. That the Court issue judgment and a peremptory writ ordering the City
6

7 respondents to set aside all actions and approvals relating to the project at 534 - 538

8 N. Kenwood Street and to refrain from further consideration of project approval until it

9 fully complies with CEQA by preparing an adequate EIR and adopting feasible

10 alternatives and mitigation measures;
11
2. That the Court enjoin the City and real parties in Interest and their
12

13 employees and agents from all pre-construction and construction activities relating to

14 the project at 534- 538 N. Kenwood Street while the petition is pending;

15 3. For the Society's reasonable costs, expenses, and attorney fees pursuant to
16 Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5; and
17

18 4. For other and further relief as the Court finds proper.
