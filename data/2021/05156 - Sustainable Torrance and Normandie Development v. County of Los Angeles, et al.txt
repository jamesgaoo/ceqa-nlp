2 Real Parties in Interest. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each
3 Respondent designated herein as a DOE has some responsibility for the events and happenings
alleged in this Petition.

5 6. The County completed an Initial Study under the California Environmental

6 Quality Act ("CEQA") to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of the Project. The Initial
7 Study indicated that the Project could potentially result in significant adverse effects on the
8 environment, but those effects would be avoided or reduced to a less than significant level
9 through Project design features and the implementation of the recommended mitigation
10 measures, as agreed to by the applicant, in a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program
11 ("MMRP"). 8 d77 dnouo LLZ06 12 7. On October 24, 2019, a Hearing Examiner public hearing was held at the Parlow

E EUNS "PALE eUILYSI!M €8E8 13 Library Auditorium located at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center at 1000 West Carson Street in
MeT jeuueyo Beverly Hills, 14 Torrance. This hearing was held during the public review period for the draft IS-MND and
15 MMRP, and was intended only for submission of formal public comments on the draft
16 environmental documents for the Project.
17 8. The County received many comments on the Project expressing concerns about
18 the potential environmental impacts of the Project and the inadequacy if the Initial Study and
19 Mitigated Negative Declaration that was conducted including from the California Attorney
20 General. The comment letter from the Attorney General was submitted pursuant to his
21 independent power and duty to protect the environment and natural resources of the State. (See

25 County Regional Planning Commission "("Commission") on April 22, 2020. Following staff's
26 presentation, public testimony, and discussion, the Commission closed the public hearing and
27 voted unanimously (5-0) to approve the Project with one modification.

10. At the virtual Board of Supervisors (Board) meeting on April 28, 2020, the Board
2 voted to call the Project up for review, citing the importance of ensuring compatibility between

3 industrial and neighborhood uses and balancing the needs of the business sector with the
environmental concerns of adjacent residents. Additionally, the Commission's approval was

5 appealed to the Board on May 4, 2020 by Craig M. Collins and Brendan Virey of Blum Collins
6 LLP, Project opponents.
7 11. On or about August 4, 2020, the Board of Supervisors for the County of Los
8 Angeles considered the Project. After a public hearing, the Board voted to approve the
9 Conditional Use Permit and adopt the Mitigated Negative Declaration. The County erroneously
10 determined that the Project would not have any potentially significant environmental effects and
11
2 issued a Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project.
MeT |euueuo Group, d77 +LZ06 SIl!H LR0S VPANE TBUS IRA BB CE Beverly 12 12. This action has been brought within the applicable statute of limitations for
13 challenging a Mitigated Negative Declaration under the Public Resources Code. The County
14 filed a Notice of Determination with the County Recorder on or about November 17, 2020.
15 13. This action arises under CEQA and its implementing regulations, which are
16 prescribed by the Secretary of the California Resources Agency to be followed by all state and
17 local agencies when undertaking projects subject to CEQA. (Pub. Resources Code§ 21000 et
18 seq.; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.) This Court has jurisdiction over the matters
19 alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, and Public Resources

20 Code section 21168.5. In the alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil
21 Procedure section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code section 21168.
22 14. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394(a) venue is proper in "the county

2 CEOA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REOUIREMENTS

16. California Environmental Quality Act is California's broadest environmental
3 law. CEQA helps to guide public agencies such as the City during issuance of permits and

4

5 approval of projects. Courts have interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest protection of the
environment within the reasonable scope of the statutes. CEQA applies to all discretionary
6 projects proposed to be conducted or approved by a City, including private projects requiring
7 discretionary government approval. See California Public Resources Code, sections 21000 -
8 21178, and. Title 14 Cal. Code Regs., section 753, and Chapter 3, sections 15000 - 15387.
9 17.

10 "CEQA broadly defines 'project' as "an activity which may cause either a direct

11 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the

Channel Law Group, d17 8
BIYSI!M E888 Blvd., Suite LLZ06 12 environment, and ... that involves the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate,

8 13 or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies.' [Citation.] The statutory definition

14 is augmented by the [CEQA ] Guidelines [Cal.Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.l, which define
a 'project' as 'the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct SW!H Beverly 15 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foresecable indirect physical change in the 16 environment....""* Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. V. City of Sonora
17 (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1222, 66 Cal.Rptr.3d 645 (Tuolumne County). This includes all
18 phases of a project that are reasonably foreseeable, and all related projects that are directly linked
19

20 to the project. (CEQA Guidelines section 15378).
18.

21 A strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an Environmental

22 Impact Report ("EIR") is built into CEQA which is reflected in what is known as the "fair

23 argument" standard, under which an agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence

24 in the record supports a fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the

25 environment. No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75, 82; Friends of "B' St.
v. City of Haywood (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988, 1002.

19. "The EIR is the primary means of achieving the Legislature's considered

2 declaration that it is the policy of this state to 'take all action necessary to protect, rehabilitate,

3 and enhance the environmental quality of the state.' [Citation.] The EIR is therefore 'the heart of

4 CEQA.' [Citations.] An EIR is an 'environmental "alarm bell" whose purpose it is to alert the

5 public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached ecological

6 points of no return."3 Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. Vv. Regents of University of California
7 (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.

8 20. Under CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, if a project is not exempt and may cause
a significant effect on the environment, the agency must prepare an EIR. PRC §§ 21100, 21151;

the environment" is defined as 9

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 20 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act)
21 21. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this
22 Petition.
23 22. The Project is located on the southeast corner of Normandie Avenue and Torrance
24 Boulevard in a dense residential area. The site borders existing homes to the north, west, and
25 east.. According to the 2017American Community Survey, 2,249 individuals live within
26 approximately 1,000 feet of the site, 84 percent of whom are people of color. In addition to
27 residents, there are multiple sensitive receptors within a mile of the site, including two

elementary schools, an Early Head Start Center, and the Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.

2 23. The local community is dealing with increased air pollution, traffic, and noise as
3 logistics facilities proliferate in the area. North of the Project site, the Farmer Brothers coffee

4 roasting facility was replaced with a 512,000-square-foot industrial warehouse in 2017,
5 intensifying truck traffic in the immediate area. The surrounding area is subject to heavy truck

6 volume and truck- related collisions, notwithstanding its residential character. The site is in the
7 South Coast Air Basin, which is currently designated as a non-attainment area for ozone and
8 PM2.s by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and as a non-attainment area for ozone, PM,
9 and PM2.s by the California Air Resources Board (CARB).

10 24. The neighborhoods around the Project already face high levels of pollution.

11 According to CalEnviroScreen 3.0, CalEPA's screening tool that ranks each census tract in the 8 d17 'dnoJ9 me] jeuueuo L1Z06 LA TOI E B S  A S C B SIl!H Apaneg 12 state for pollution and vulnerability, the Project's census tract, which includes the residential area
13 to the north, south and east of the site, ranks worse than 96 percent of the rest of the state for
14 pollution burden. Directly across Normandie Avenue to the west is a residential neighborhood
15 | that ranks in the 99th percentile for pollution burden and 84th percentile for population
16 vulnerability.
17 25. These neighborhoods have high pollution burdens attributable to contaminated
18| sites and solid waste and hazardous waste facilities in the area. The Project's census tract is in
19 the 99th percentile for cleanups, the 97th percentile for solid waste, the 91st percentile for toxic

20 releases, the 88th percentile for hazardous waste, and the 82nd percentile for groundwater
21 threats. Air pollution is also a problem for the community, which scores high on PM2.s (82nd

22 percentile), traffic density (84thpercentile), and diesel particulate matter (73rd percentile). The
23 tract west of Normandie Avenue scores above the 90th percentile in nearly every metric of
24 pollution: cleanups (99th percentile), hazardous waste (98th percentile), traffic density (95th
25 percentile), toxic releases (94th percentile), impaired water (94th percentile), groundwater threats
26 (91st percentile), solid waste (90th percentile), and PM2,s (82nd percentile). The western

27 neighborhood also faces challenges from poverty, unemployment, and housing burden.

26. As explained below, the Project threatens to generate further air and noise
2| pollution, as well as traffic, in this community of color.
3 27. The MND Utilizes an Outdated Emissions Model. A lead agency must make "a

4 reasoned and good faith effort to inform decision makers and the public" about a project's

5 potential impacts. Using scientifically outdated data or models does not comply with CEQA's

6 requirement that agencies make "a good faith effort at full disclosure."

The MND used an outdated model to calculate emissions from mobile sources. 7

8 The MND relies upon CARB's 2014 Emission Factors model (EMFAC2014), rather than the 28.

current model (EMFAC2017). EMFAC2017 includes important differences from the
10 EMFAC2014 in projections relevant to the Project. For instance, NOx emissions from heavy-
duty trucks are significantly higher in the new model. Similarly, PM emissions are higher for 8 12 heavy-duty trucks and the idling emissions rate is higher. Given the cumulative impact of air 11

The Project's MND lists potential impacts to more than a dozen categories, but finds that

23 mitigation measures, however, reveals that they will be insufficient to protect the community
24 from significant environmental impacts and that additional mitigation is feasible. The County

25 failed to mitigate impacts deriving from the operation of the warehouse. The Project will have
26 potentially significant impacts related to impacts to air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, noise,
27 and traffic.

30. The Project Will Have the Significant Impact of Conflicting with Adopted Land
2 Use Plans and Therefore the County Should Prepare an EIR. Conflict with applicable land use

3 plans, policies, or regulations, adopted to avoid or mitigate environmental effects, qualifies as an

4 environmental impact under CEQA. Furthermore, whenever there is a fair argument of
5 significant environmental impact, such as an inconsistency with a local land use plan, the lead
6 agency should prepare an environmental impact report. The Project conflicts with several
7 provisions of the Los Angeles County General Plan and Climate Action Plan. The County
8 General Plan has several policies that require a buffer between incompatible land uses, including
9 Policy N 1.11, Policy ED 2.2, and Policy LU 7.1. Yet, as planned, the Project will construct an
10 industrial warehouse on a site located in extremely close proximity to residential homes.. A more
11 substantial buffer is necessary to mitigate many of the Project's impacts on the surrounding 8 d11 'dnoJ9 MET jeuueuo 44Z06 to comply with General Plan policies. 4A06 VPNE 12 community and
13 31. The Project is also inconsistent with the Climate Action Plan's policy of
ñ eu!ySI!M €8€8 14 promoting sustainability in land use design. The MND suggests that siting an industrial
Beverly 15 warehouse within feet of residences is an example of compliance with this policy. However, this
16 is an example of incompatible land use development rather than a diversity of urban and
17 suburban developments that would further sustainability.
18 32. The County should have studied and addressed the Project's conflict with the
19 County's General Plan and Climate Action Plan in a full environmental impact report.
20 33. For the aforementioned reasons, Respondent committed a prejudicial abuse of
21 discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by law by failing to conduct the required
22 environmental analysis under CEQA before approving the Project.

Re: Notice of Intent to Commence CEQA Action and Proceeding; Bridge Point South Bay II Warehouse Project (SCH # 2019099067)

To Whom It May Concern:
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under California Public Resources Code section 21167.5, that Petitioner, Sustainable Torrance and Normandie Development (*Petitioner"), intends to immediately file a Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition") under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") against the County of Los Angeles ("County" or "Respondent"). The Petition will be filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court and will allege, inter alia, that the County incorrectly determined that the Bridge Point South Bay II Project ("Project") would have no significant effects on the environment. Petitioner will allege that the County adopted a Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") for the Project when an Environmental Impact Report was required.

Among other things, the Petition will request that the court direct the County to vacate and rescind the project approvals and the MND, and to otherwise comply with CEQA. Also, the Petition will seek Petitioner's cost and attorneys' fees.
Sincerely, qAap

Angeles County; Sustainable Torrance and Normandie Development v. County of Los
Angeles et al (State Clearinghouse Number 2019099067)
Honorable Attorney General Becerra:
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code $21167.7 and Code of Civil
Procedure Section §388, that on December 15, 2020 Sustainable Torrance and Normandie Development, filed a petition for writ of mandate against the County of Los Angeles ("Respondent" or "County"). The lawsuit has been filed in the Los Angeles County Superior Court. The petition alleges, among other things, that the County incorrectly determined that the proposed warehouse project ("Project") known as "Bridge Point South Bay II" would not have a significant effect on the environment under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Your office wrote a letter outlining the legal deficiencies with the Project and the Mitigated Negative Declaration on or about January 27, 2020. Please call if you have any questions.

Sincerely, 94luo
Jamie T. Hall
