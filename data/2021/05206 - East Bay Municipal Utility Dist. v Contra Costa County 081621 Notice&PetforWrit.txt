TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA:

3 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code §21167.7 that on August 12,

5 2021, East Bay Municipal Utility District ("District") filed a petition for writ of mandate against

6 Respondents Contra Costa County and Contra Costa County Board of Supervisors in Contra

7 Costa County Superior Court challenging Respondents' actions approving the Tassajara Parks

8 Project ("Project"), a 125-unit single family housing development in unincorporated Contra

9 Costa County without a supply of water. In connection with that approval, Respondents certified

10 an environmental impact report ("EIR") for the Project stating that water will be supplied by the

11 District but the District has made clear that the Project is outside its ultimate service boundary

BARG COFFIN 00 12 and it does not intend to supply water to the Project. Respondents' certification of the EIR

LEWIS & TRAF w 13 violated CEQA because: (a) the EIR failed to identify a reliable source of water and assess the

Z 14
c impacts of providing it, and (b) Respondents failed to correct and recirculate the EIR once they

15 learned that the water they were relying on (from the District) would not materialize.

4 T 16 Respondents' approval of the Project violated State Planning and Zoning Law and County

17 General Plan provisions that prohibit approval of projects without adequate water.
A copy of the petition is attached to this notice.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE / Contra Costa Superior Court Case No.:

1 I. INTRODUCTION

2 1. Contra Costa County ("County") and its Board of Supervisors (collectively,
"Respondents") approved a 125-unit single family housing development (the "Tassajara Parks

4 Project" or "Project") in unincorporated Contra Costa County without a supply of water. Under
applicable law, this is illegal.

6 2. In connection with that approval, Respondents certified an environmental impact

7 report ("EIR") stating that water will be supplied by Petitioner East Bay Municipal Utility

8 District (the "District"), but the District has repeatedly made clear - most recently in a June 8,
2021 Resolution of its Board (attached as Exhibit A) - that it "does not intend to serve the

10 Project."

11 3. The Project is located outside of the District's Ultimate Service Boundary

N1HH00 DUVA 0 ddVHL 8 LEWIS 12 (*USB"), and Respondents' approval assumes the District will: (a) expand its USB to encompass

13 the Project and (b) provide water to the Project.

14 4. The District has informed Respondents that it will do neither because, in light of
OllY 15 the drought and other pressures on its water supply, the District has determined that (a) its

16 existing sources of water are already (i.e., without the Project) insufficient to reliably serve

17 current and future customers within its USB, and (b) therefore, annexing the Project would

18 violate the District's Annexation Policies.

19 5. Respondents' approval of the Project violated State Planning and Zoning Law and

20 County General Plan provisions that prohibit approval of projects without adequate water.

21 6. Respondents' certification of the EIR also violated the California Environmental

22 Quality Act ("CEQA") because (a) the EIR failed to identify a reliable source of water and assess
23 the impacts of providing it, and (b) Respondents failed to correct and recirculate the EIR once
24 they learned that the water they were relying on (from the District) would not materialize.

25 7. Therefore, the District hereby petitions the Court to set aside Respondents'

26 approval of the Project and certification of the EIR.

1 II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

8. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to California Code of Civil
3 Procedure section 1094.5 (alternatively, section 1085), and Public Resources Code sections

4 21168 (alternatively, section 21168.5) and 21168.9. This Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of

5 mandate directing the County to vacate and set aside approval of the Project and certification of
the EIR under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5. The Court has jurisdiction to

7 issue declaratory relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1060 and injunctive relief

8 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 525 et seq.

9 9. Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of action alleged in this Petition

10 arose in the County of Contra Costa. Venue is also proper in this Court because the Project is

11 located in the County of Contra Costa.

ddVHl 8 CVHL Y SIMGY LEWIS 1HHO0 DHVA 12 III. PARTIES

13 10. Petitioner EAST BAY MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT (the "District") is a
14| public utility formed in 1923 by California's Municipal Utility District Act. (Pub. Utility Code
15 section 11501 et seq.) The District provides drinking water to approximately 1.4 million
16 customers in Alameda and Contra Costa counties. The District's water supply primarily comes

17 from capturing snowmelt from the Mokelumne River watershed and storing it at Pardee

18 Reservoir, 90 miles east of the Bay Area.

19 11. In addition, local runoff is stored in several East Bay reservoirs for treatment and
20 delivery to customers and to assure emergency supplies are available locally. In dry years,

21 enough water can be lost through evaporation to completely offset any water gained from local

22 runoff.

23 12. With regards to the Project, the District is a responsible agency under Public

24 Resources Code section 21080.1.

25 13. The District and its customers would be directly, adversely and irreparably
26 affected by the Project and its components, as described herein, until and unless this Court

27 provides the relief requested in this petition.

14 18.

LEWIS TTO 15 Real Parties in Interest, Does through 20 are persons or entities presently

d unknown to the Petitioner who claim some legal or equitable interest in the Project that is the
16 subject of this action. Petitioner will amend this petition to state their true names and capacities

17 once they become known.

18 IV. LEGAL BACKGROUND

19 19.

20 CEQA has two primary purposes: it informs decision-makers and the public about

21 potential, significant environmental effects of a proposed action (CEQA Guidelines, §

22 15002(a)(1)), and it requires agencies minimize environmental damage when feasible.

20.

23 CEQA requires that a lead agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of

24 a proposed action in an EIR except in limited circumstances not present here. Courts have called
the EIR the heart of CEQA and an "environmental 'alarm bell' whose purpose is to alert the
25 public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached the
26 ecological points of no return." (Bakersfield Citizens for Local Control v. City of Bakersfield

27

28 (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1184, 1214, 1220.) The EIR also a functions as a "document of
accountability," intended to "demonstrate to an apprehensive citizenry that the lead agency has,

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE / Contra Costa Superior Court Case No.:

in fact, analyzed and considered the ecological implications of its action." (Laurel Heights

2 Improvements Ass'n. v. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.) The EIR
3 process thus "protects not only the environment but also "informed self-government." (Pocket

4 Protectors v. City of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 903, 927.)

21. An EIR must contain a sufficient degree of analysis to allow decision-makers to

6 make an intelligent decision. The analysis in the EIR must be sufficient to connect the dots
between facts and conclusion; it may not include the lead agency's bare conclusions or opinions.

8 An EIR's analysis must be supported by substantial evidence, and not "argument, speculation,
unsubstantiated opinion or narrative [or] evidence which is clearly erroneous or inaccurate."

10 22. it When it comes to water supply, "CEQA's informational purposes are not satisfied

11 by an EIR that simply ignores or assumes a solution to the problem of supplying water to a

BARG COFFIN 1 12 proposed land use project. Decision-makers must, under the law, be presented with sufficient

3 13
z 88 E LEWIS & TRAPP facts to 'evaluate the pros and cons' of supplying the amount of water that the [project] will

14 need." (Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth v City of Rancho Cordova ("Vineyard
V. County of Orange O1 1 V 15 Citizens ")(2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 431 [quoting Santiago County Water Dist.

16 (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 818, 829].)] An EIR's water supply impact analysis must address

17 uncertainties regarding a project's water supplies, must identify a water source with a likelihood

sources. 18 of actually proving available, and must discuss possible replacement or alternative water

19 23. If significant changes to the project or its circumstances occur, or'new information

20 becomes available, after a final EIR has been prepared but before it is certified as complete, the

21 agency must revise the EIR and recirculate it or the revised portions of it for public review and
22 comment. The standards for recirculation are similar to the standards for determining whether
23 changes or new information trigger the need for a subsequent or supplemental EIR once an EIR
&4 has been certified.

V. STATEMENT OF FACTS

26 A. The District

27 24. The District is a publicly-owned utility established by California's Municipal

28 Utility District Act. The District's mission is to manage the natural resources with which the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE / Contra Costa Superior Court Case No.:

1 District is entrusted; to provide reliable, high quality water and wastewater services at fair and

2 reasonable rates for the people of the East Bay; and to preserve and protect the environment for

3 future generations.

4 25. The District's Ultimate Service Boundary (USB) defines the territory within

5 which it has planned to provide water service. The District's USB encompasses 332 square miles

6 and includes 20 cities, 15 unincorporated East Bay communities, and approximately 1.4 million

7 customers.

8 26. The Project site is outside of the District's current USB, in an unincorporated part

9 of Contra Costa County.

10 27. The District has policies ("Annexation Policies") that govern annexation of new

11 territory into the USB. (See Annexation Policy 3.01 (effective November 24, 2015), 3.05

BARG COFFIN LEWIS & TRAPP S A 12 (effective April 26, 2016), and 3.08 (effective September 14, 2010), copies attached as Exhibit B

13 to this petition.) These policies are designed to ensure the District does not annex new territory
yoIlv 14 into its USB when doing SO would threaten the District's ability to provide water service to

15 existing and future customers within its current USB.

16 28. District's Annexation Policies guard against significant environmental impacts
17 flowing from the procurement of additional water supplies for areas the District is not planning to

18 service.

19 29. Of particular relevance, District Annexation Policy 3.05 ("Considerations for

20 Extension of Water Beyond the Ultimate Service Boundary") provides, "The District will not

21 extend water to areas outside the present Ultimate Service Boundary (USB) of the District, if

22 such extension would result in . A reduction in the quantity of water available to District
23 customers to satisfy existing or projected levels of demand.. The phrase 'District customers'

24 shall mean (i) existing water service customers of the District and (ii) future customers, located

25 within the present USB, but not now receiving water service."

2 The Tassajara Parks Project involves (a) the construction of 125 single-family

3 residences on an approximately 30-acre site, and (b) additional acreage of grading, and

4 infrastructure, including a detention basin.

31.
5 Respondents' approval of the Project includes (a) expanding the County's Urban

11 VI. ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENTS FOR THE PROJECT

A.
BARG COFFIN ddV8l 8 SIM37 Ö ^ 12 Draft EIR

32.
13 The County issued a draft EIR ("DEIR") on May 12, 2016, held a hearing on it on

z 14
R June 6, 2016, and received public comments on it through July 18, 2016. The DEIR initially

15 identified two possible sources of water for the Project: purchasing supply from Calaveras Public

A T 16 Utility District or annexation into the District's USB.

33.
17 On July 13, 2016, the District submitted written comments on the DEIR

18 identifying legal inadequacies and factual errors in the document. These comments included, but

19 were not limited to, the following:

a.
20 The DEIR failed to adequately disclose, analyze and mitigate impacts

21 resulting from the Project's inconsistency with the District's Annexation Policies

22 resulting in a "significant and unavoidable" impact under CEQA.
b.
23 The DEIR failed to adequately analyze the Project impacts to water

24 resources generally, including impacts to water supply, water quality, water infrastructure,

25 water demand, growth-inducing impacts, and alternative sources of water supply.

C.
26 The DEIR over-estimated the feasibility of a recycled water offset as a

27 mitigation measure for the Project, and on that basis, erroneously concluded that the

28 Project's impacts were insignificant.

2 34. Recirculated Draft EIR

3

4 The County issued a Recirculated DEIR ('RDEIR") (altering its water supply

5 evaluation) on September 29, 2016, held a hearing on it on November 14, 2016, and received
public comments on it through November 30, 2016.

35.

6

7 The RDEIR rejected the option of purchasing water from Calaveras Public Utility

8 District and identifies the District as the Project's water source. The RDEIR eliminated the

9 recycled water offset mitigation (that had been included in the DEIR) due to infeasibility. In its

10 place, the RDEIR stated Respondents intend "to augment EBMUD's potable water availability

11 by facilitating, accelerating and implementing conservation beyond currently planned levels

BARG COFFIN LEWIS & TRAPP o 12 within EBMUD's service area by an amount sufficient to offset the Project's water demand."

C.

36.

w RDEIR's Treatment of Conflict with District's Annexation Policies

z ar 14 In assessing consistency with the District's Annexation Policies, the RDEIR

ATTO 13 acknowledged that annexation to EBMUD's USB would require a corresponding expansion of

15 EBMUD's Sphere of Influence and both actions would be subject to LAFCO approval.
37.

17 38. The RDEIR also stated that "the applicant would need to demonstrate that the
16 Project's water strategy is consistent with these policies, as determined by the EBMUD Board."

18

19 The RDEIR, however, determined that implementation of Mitigation Measure
USS-1 [requiring the applicant to demonstrate the provision of adequate water supply via a will-

21 serve letter from EBMUD before the final map can be recorded] "would ensure that all EBMUD
20 annexation policies are adhered to and would reduce impacts to a less than significant level."
39.

22

23 The RDEIR noted that "inconsistency with policies would cause a significant
environmental impact."

40.

24

25 CEQA. The RDEIR concluded that if the District's Board of Directors approves the

26 annexation, then there is no inconsistency that needs to be publicly disclosed or evaluated under

D.

27 41.

28 RDEIR's Treatment of Impacts to Water Supply
Regarding water supply, the RDEIR determined that off-site water conservation
would involve either: (1) an expansion of EBMUD's existing potable water conservation

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE / Contra Costa Superior Court Case No.: 8

1 program by funding potable water conservation at a level beyond what EBMUD ultimately

2 approved on April 24, 2012, as part of its Water Supply Management Plan ("WSMP") 2040 Final

3 Plan, or (2) implementation of an acceleration or expansion of measures that were included in the

4 WSMP 2040 Final Plan but are not yet funded for implementation.
42. The RDEIR's water supply evaluation, at Appendix J, found that that

6 implementation of "Level E" conservation measures as described in the District's WSMP 2040

7 would conserve 2 million gallons per day (mgd) of water and offset the Project's increased water

8 demand. The RDEIR concluded that this amount was in excess of that needed to serve the
9 Project.

10 E. District's Comments on RDEIR

11 43. On November 21, 2016, the District submitted written comments detailing the
ddvHl 8 LEWIS BARG COFFIN 1n 12 legal deficiencies and factual errors in the RDEIR. These comments included, but were not
13 limited to, the following:

N8OILV 14 44. The RDEIR failed to disclose that the Project "is inconsistent with these

15 [Annexation] Policies," which were adopted for the purpose of avoiding or mitigating an
16 environmental effect, and Respondents should have "identified a significant and unavoidable

17 environmental impact" because the Project "conflict[s] with any applicable land use plan, policy,

18 or regulation."

19 45. The RDEIR's determination that the District possesses sufficient water supply to

20 service the Project by "accelerating currently planned conservation" is arbitrary and not

21 supported by substantial evidence. The District noted that "[a]ccelerating water conservation

22 programs is already required to ensure the District's ability to meet demand through year 2040."

23 46. The RDEIR failed to adequately disclose and analyze the Project's impacts to

24 water service infrastructure.

25 47. The RDEIR failed to adequately analyze the significant growth-inducing impacts
26 that Project might have on the greater area, including implications and impacts of obtaining water
27 sources for potential growth.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE / Contra Costa Superior Court Case No.:

1 48.

2 The RDEIR rejected the alternative of obtaining water from Calaveras Public

3 Utility District but failed to meaningfully evaluate any alternative source of water supply except
for provision by EBMUD.

4 F. 2020 Final EIR

5 49.

6 The County issued the Final EIR ("FEIR"), comprised of the RDEIR, Appendices,

7 Master Responses and Responses to Written Comments on the RDEIR and Draft EIR, Changes

to

8 the RDEIR and a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program on September 14, 2020.

50. Regarding the District's Annexation Policies, the FEIR erroneously found the

10 "proposed project can, in fact, be determined consistent with said policies." It states that "a

11 definitive interpretation of the Project's consistency must be made by the EBMUD Board of

LEWIS & TRAPP BARG COFFIN S A 12 Directors, who are the District's policy and decision makers." The FEIR also concluded that

13 impacts to water resources were less than significant under CEQA.

51.

z 14 In its September 29, 2020 comments on the FEIR, the District reiterated its

AT T ( 15 continued opposition to annexation and noted that the FEIR violates CEQA by failing to: a)

16 analyze whether the Project can realistically obtain a water supply; b) meaningfully describe and

17 analyze water conservation measures and c) disclose the conflict with the District's Annexation

18 Policies which results in "significant and unavoidable impact" under CEQA.

52.

19 The District also identified several of the FEIR's findings which are not supported

20 by substantial evidence, including but not limited to: (a) an inadequate water supply evaluation

21 which conflicts with the analysis of the District (i.e., the very agency the FEIR relies upon to

22 supply the water); and (b) a flawed water demand estimate.

G.

23 53. Changed Circumstances Prior to FEIR Certification

24 Since the issuance of the FEIR, California has entered an historic drought fueled

25 by human-caused climate change, which exacerbates drought cycles. California's current

26 drought is likely to persist. The District's recently-released Draft Urban Water Management Plan

27 ('UWMP") 2020 identifies a substantial increase in USB-wide demand over the next thirty years

28 and several thousand acre-feet in unmet need for existing customers in times of drought in the

future.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE / Contra Costa Superior Court Case No.: 10

54.

2 On April 27, 2021, the District Board issued a Stage One drought declaration,

3 finding the District's water supplies insufficient to meet existing customer demand within its

4 USB, establishing a rationing goal of 10 percent, declaring the need to purchase supplemental

5 water supplies and directing staff to promote customer water conservation. (See Exhibit C, a true

6 copy of Resolution No. 35222-21, the "Drought Declaration.") Since April 27, 2021, the

7 District's water supply projections for 2021 have further plummeted by 65-70 thousand acre-feet.
55.

8 Dry conditions in the State have led to other State level directives the State

9 Water Resources Control Board's water curtailment actions and Central Valley Project water

10 supply cutbacks - that further limit the District's water supply.
56.

11 In a May 27, 2021 letter to the County, the District informed Respondents that the

BARG COFFIN LEWIS & TRAPP S A 12 April 27, 2021 Drought Declaration constituted significant new information and a changed

13 circumstance affecting the Project that was not previously disclosed to the public or analyzed in

z E 14 any environmental document and that recirculation of the FEIR was required.

57.

ATT( 15 On June 8, 2021, the District's Board passed Resolution No. 35229-21 (attached

16 as Exhibit A, the "June 8 Resolution") opposing annexation of the Project because the District

17 "must reserve all sources of water supply available to mitigate water supply deficiencies it

18 experiences during droughts and to address the potential impacts of other stressors and

19 constraints on its water supplies" and formally (i) finding that "serving the Project using water

20 created through implementation of conservation programs throughout the District's service area

21 is not feasible because doing so would take a source of water supply away from existing and

22 future customers within the [Ultimate Service Boundary] USB," and (ii) declaring that the

23 "District (a) is opposed to annexing the Project into its service area and (b) does not intend to
serve the Project."

24 58. The a District provided a copy of the June 8 Resolution to the County before the
25 June 9, 2021 County Planning Commission hearing on the Project.

26 59.

27 On June 9, 2021, the County Planning Commission passed a motion with a 4-2

28 vote recommending that the County Board of Supervisors deny the Project based on the
following: (1) modifying the ULL is not in the public interest; (2) concerns over the availability

approved the Project and certified the FEIR.

5 VII. PROCEDURAL ALLEGATIONS

6 60.

7 Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by serving

8 on August 11, 2021 a written notice of Petitioner's intent to commence this action against
Respondents. A copy of the written notice is attached to this petition as Exhibit D.
61.

10 Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law

11 unless this Court grants the relief requested below.

62.

LEWIS & TRAPP BARG COFFIN Co 12 Petitioner brings this action pursuant to Public Resources Code sections 21168

w 13 and 21168.5, as well as Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, which require that a

Z 14 lead agency's approval of a Project be set aside if the lead

a agency has prejudicially abused its

15
AT T discretion. Prejudicial abuse of discretion occurs either where a lead agency has failed to proceed
in a manner required by law or where its determination or decision is not supported by substantial
16 evidence. Respondents have prejudicially abused their discretion because the County's findings

17

18 are not supported by substantial evidence and the County failed to comply with the procedural
and substantive requirements of CEQA.

19 63.

20 Respondents have abused their discretion and failed to act as required by law in
the following ways:

21

22 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

23 64. (Violations of State Planning and Zoning Law)

24 above. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth

25 65.

26 Government Code section 65300 et seq. requires the legislative body of a county

27 to adopt a general plan for the physical development of the county. The general plan is a

28 framework for future development to which other land use decisions must conform. Accordingly,
any decision by a county affecting land use and development must comply with its general plan,

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE / Contra Costa Superior Court Case No.: 12

66.

2

3 The Project is inconsistent with the County's General Plan because the Project

4 conflicts with the General Plan requirement that new development may not be approved without
an adequate water supply.

67.

5

6 As result, Respondents did not proceed in the manner required by law, and their
decision to approve the Project was not supported by substantial evidence. Accordingly,

7 approval of the Project in its entirety must be set aside.

8

9 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (VIOLATIONS OF CEQA; failure to proceed in manner required by law)

68.

11 69. Petitioner incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth above.

BARG COFFIN LEWIS ddvdl 8 0 A 12 CEQA requires a lead agency for a project to prepare an EIR that complies with
the requirements of the statute.

w 13 70.

z R 14 In approving this Project, Respondents certified an EIR that fails to comply with
CEQA in the following ways:

15 a.

A T 16 Failed to provide a stable and consistent Project description, including a
viable source of water;

17 b.

18 Failed to adopt an appropriate environmental baseline for analysis of the
Project's impacts;

19 C.

20 d. Improperly deferred impact analysis and mitigation measures;

21 of the Project; Failed to adequately analyze the cumulative and growth-inducing impacts

22 e.

23 resources; and Failed to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's impacts to water

24 f.

25 71. Failed to adequately analyze an alternate source of water for the Project.

26 As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their

27 discretion by certifying an EIR that does not comply with CEQA and approving the Project in

28 reliance on a defective EIR. Accordingly, Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of
the Project must be set aside.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE / Contra Costa Superior Court Case No.: 13

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

2 72. (VIOLATION OF CEQA; Failure to Recirculate EIR)

3 above. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth

4 73.

5 CEQA requires that if significant new information arises before certification of an
EIR, the EIR must be amended and recirculated for public review and comment.

6 74. Comments submitted to Respondents before certification of the EIR raised

8 significant new information regarding the absence of a water supply for the Project.
75.

9 Respondents failed to amend or recirculate the EIR, and the public was deprived
of an opportunity to meaningfully comment on water-supply-related impacts.

10 76.

11 Therefore, Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and their
certification of the EIR is not supported by substantial evidence.

13 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

14 77. (VIOLATION OF CEQA; Inadequate Findings)
Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth

15 above.

16 78. CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be

17 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that a lead

18 agency provide an explanation demonstrating that evidence in the record supports the conclusions

19 it reached.

20 79. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting findings that are contrary to law and not

21 supported by substantial evidence in the record, including, but not limited to, the following:

22 a. The determination that impacts to water resources would be less than

23 significant and/or that mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the Project's significant

24 effects on the environment; and

25 b. Failing to disclose to the public that the Project is inconsistent with

26 District's Annexation Policies and will result in a significant impact to water resources.

27 80. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their

28 discretion by adopting findings that violate the requirements of CEQA and approving the Project

RESOLUTION NO. 35229-21 Secretary
East Bay Municipal Utility District
DECLARING EAST BAY MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT'S (DISTRICT) OPPOSITION TO ANNEXING THE TASSAJARA PARKS PROJECT INTO THE DISTRICT'S SERVICE AREA, FINDING THE PROJECT INCONSISTENT WITH THE DISTRICT'S ANNEXATION
POLICIES, AND MAKING FINDINGS AND DECLARATIONS REGARDING THE
UNAVAILABILITY OF WATER TO SERVE THE PROJECT

Introduced by Director Patterson Seconded by Director Mellon

WHEREAS, Contra Costa County (County) is considering approving the Tassajara Parks Project (Project), a proposed 125-unit single family residential development in unincorporated County territory, outside the County's Urban Limit Line; and
WHEREAS, the Project is outside but adjacent to the District's service area, Ultimate Service
Boundary (USB), and Sphere of Influence; and
WHEREAS, the USB defines the geographic area within which the District has planned to provide water service to existing and future customers; and
WHEREAS, due to the Project's location outside the USB, the District has not planned to provide it with water service; and
WHEREAS, as set forth in District Policy 3.05 - Considerations for Extension of Water Beyond the Ultimate Service Boundary, it is the policy of this Board of Directors (Board) that the District shall not extend water to areas outside the current USB if such extension would result in a
reduction in the quantity or quality of water available to serve present and future customers within the USB or an increase in the costs of service; and
WHEREAS, as set forth in District Policy 3.01 - Annexations, it is further the policy of this Board to oppose annexations outside the current USB unless several enumerated conditions are
met; and

WHEREAS, as set forth in District Policy 3.08 - Advisory Election for Annexations Outside the Contra Costa County Urban Limit Line, it is further the policy of this Board to oppose annexations of proposed residential developments of less than 200 units located outside the
County's Urban Limit Line that are inconsistent with Policy 3.01; and
WHEREAS, based on these Policies, throughout the County's environmental review process for the Project, the District has stated its opposition to annexing the Project into its service area; and
WHEREAS, despite the District's opposition to annexing the Project, the County has consistently assumed the District would provide water service to the Project; and
WHEREAS. the County's Final Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the Project, published in September 2020, assumed the District would provide water service to the Project based on a
proposed offsite water conservation offset (Proposal), under which the Project would fund water

conservation programs throughout the District's service area to offset the Project's water demand; and

WHEREAS, the Proposal relies on implementation of water conservation programs, a component of the District's water supplies available to meet the needs of current and future customers within the current USB; and
WHEREAS, as a long-time leader in water conservation, the District has engaged in a decades- long, comprehensive effort in water conservation throughout its service area, and its efforts to promote water conservation include, but are not limited to:
(a) adopting a Water Conservation Master Plan in 1994, specifying water conservation strategies for building on the District's then-existing water conservation efforts and
creating a pathway for future water conservation through expanding rebates and incentives and providing conservation information to its customers. The Master Plan was updated in 2011-- to extend the planning horizon to 2040-- and is currently in the process of being updated again;
(b) sponsoring legislation to ensure that land use planning takes into account the
availability of adequate water supplies for proposed new development before the development is approved. These efforts included SB 901 (1995) to require water supply assessments, and SB 221 and SB 610 in 2001 to further improve upon the water supply assessment process;
(c) adopting its own water efficiency and wise water use requirements through Sections 29 and 31 of its Board-adopted Regulations Governing Water Service to Customers of East Bay Municipal Utility District;
(d) implementing a long-running water conservation education program, including school education efforts beginning in 1974, writing and publishing large format books promoting water conservation, and engaging with the public regarding water conservation by maintaining water conservation demonstration gardens, staffing water conservation displays at community events, and organizing and sponsoring the annual Water Conservation Showcase since 2004, which event brings together representatives from water agencies, industry, government, and nonprofits to discuss pressing water issues and learn about new water conservation technologies and solutions;
(e) incentivizing water conservation through a fully staffed, permanent, year-in, year-out water conservation program, with a cumulative budget now totaling over $100 million, and including measures such as water conservation rebate and incentive programs and distribution of water conservation devices to customers; and
WHEREAS, water conservation has long been key component of the District's water supply portfolio, pursuant to which the District (1) achieved approximately 46 million gallons per day (MGD) in water conservation savings between 1995 and 2018 and (2) continues to pursue further expansion of its already-robust water conservation program; and
WHEREAS, remaining water conservation potential within the District's USB is an important

2

tool the District can and does use to address the impacts of water supply deficiencies on its customers; and

WHEREAS, the Final EIR generally failed to analyze the feasibility of the Proposal and specifically failed to assess whether and to what extent depleting the District's remaining water conservation potential would jeopardize the District's ability to meet the needs of current and future customers within the District's current USB; and
WHEREAS, the District submitted to the County detailed comments on the Final EIR, objecting to the County's failure to analyze the feasibility of the Proposal, explaining the Project's inconsistency with the District's Board-adopted Policies regarding annexation of new service territory, and stating the District's opposition to annexing the Project into its service area; and
WHEREAS, following publication of the Final EIR, District staff engaged in discussions with County staff and the Project developer's team regarding the feasibility of Proposal; and
WHEREAS, the Project developer's team prepared an assessment addressing in part the technical and economic feasibility of the Proposal; and
WHEREAS, the Project developer's assessment did not address the effect of the Proposal on the District's ability to serve current and future customers within the current USB; and
WHEREAS, current drought conditions prevailing throughout much of California have highlighted the importance of protecting all of the District's water supplies-including supplies created through water conservation--for current and future District customers within the current
USB; and

WHEREAS, 2021 has thus far been the second driest year on record in the Mokelumne River basin, where most of the District's water supplies originate; and
WHEREAS, 2021 has thus far been the driest year on record for the East Bay; and
WHEREAS, the snow depth at Caples Lake, a Mokelumne basin snow survey reference point, was at 52 percent of average as of April 19, 2021 and the California Department of Water Resources' Bulletin 120 forecast of the forecasted runoff on the Mokelumne River is at 42
percent of average; and

WHEREAS, on March 22, 2021, the State Water Resources Control Board sent a warning letter to the District and other water rights holders which noted the unusually dry conditions prevailing throughout California, and urged water rights holders to begin planning for potential water supply shortages by taking actions such as increasing water conservation and diversifying water supply portfolios; and
WHEREAS, on April 27, 2021, based on the projected impact of the prevailing dry conditions on the District's water supplies, this Board declared the District's water supplies deficient for meeting customer demands, declared a Stage 1 drought, established a District-wide ten percent rationing goal, declared the need to purchase supplemental supplies, and directed District staff to take actions to promote customer water conservation; and

3

WHEREAS, since this Board's April 27, 2021 drought-related actions, the District's water supply projections for this water year have continued to decline, with the District's anticipated end-of-September storage levels now 65-70 thousand acre-feet lower than previously projected; and

WHEREAS, as demonstrated in this year's drought and other droughts in recent years, the District's water supplies are not sufficient to meet customer demand in times of drought, requiring the District to purchase supplemental supplies and impose water rationing requirements on its customers; and
WHEREAS, dry year deficiencies in the District's supplies are expected to persist, and the District's Draft Urban Water Management Plan 2020 identifies both a substantial increase in USB-wide demand over the next thirty years, and several thousand acre-feet in unmet need for water in times of drought in the future; and
WHEREAS, in addition to drought, many other stressors threaten to reduce the amount of water available to District customers now and in the future, including climate change, future regulatory actions, and cutbacks in the availability of water to the District under its Central Valley Project (CVP) contract with the United States Department of Interior Bureau of Reclamation (Reclamation); and
WHEREAS, the District's Urban Water Management Plan 2015 estimated that climate change could result in a several thousand acre-foot increase in the District's unmet need for water by the year 2040; and

WHEREAS, climate change may also result in more frequent and severe droughts in the future; and

WHEREAS, the State Water Resources Control Board's efforts to update the Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan have thus far focused on improving Bay-Delta water quality by significantly increasing instream flow requirements on tributary rivers to the Bay-Delta, like the Mokelumne River, where most of the District's water supplies originate; and
WHEREAS, the Bay-Delta Water Quality Control Plan Update is likely to increase the District's Mokelumne River instream flow obligations by tens of thousands of acre-feet per year, adding a significant new constraint on the District's water supplies that could impair its ability to meet customer demands in the future; and

WHEREAS, during the last drought, the State of California directly involved itself in local water management, both by issuing curtailment orders requiring water rights holders like the District to divert less water, and by promulgating emergency regulations dictating reductions in customer demand; and

WHEREAS, 2014 and 2015 curtailment orders required the District to bypass approximately 76 thousand acre-feet of water on the Mokelumne River that would have otherwise been available to
serve its customers; and
WHEREAS, the State of California could take similar actions this year and in future droughts,

4

requiring the District to achieve short-term reductions in water consumption and reducing the availability of Mokelumne River water for District customers; and
WHEREAS, in addition to customer rationing, the District's CVP contract provides a key source
of supply to meet customer demands during droughts; and
WHEREAS, during the 2014-15 drought, CVP allocations were cut to only 25% for Municipal and Industrial contractors like the District, significantly reducing the amount of CVP water available to the District and forcing the District to purchase supplemental supplies on the spot water transfers market; and

WHEREAS, securing supplemental supplies on the spot transfers market in 2015 was both challenging and expensive, with spot transfer water prices seven to ten times higher than CVP water prices; and
WHEREAS, on May 26, 2021, Reclamation indicated the District's CVP allocation would again be cut to 25%, thus dramatically reducing the amount of CVP water available to address the District's drought-induced water supply deficiencies this year; and
WHEREAS, because of the late date on which CVP cutbacks were announced, it is very unlikely the District will be able to purchase water on the spot transfers market, as most available water has already been purchased by other parties; and
WHEREAS, CVP allocations could be similarly reduced in future droughts, and there are no
assurances that supplemental water will be available on the spot transfers market to replace the District's reduced CVP supplies, potentially leaving the District without adequate supplies to meet customer demands; and
WHEREAS, given the existing and predicted future deficiencies in the District's water supplies during droughts, and other threats and stressors on those supplies, the District must adhere to its policies regarding the annexation of new service territory; and
WHEREAS, offsetting the Project's demand through conservation programs would take "new water" created through those programs away from District customers within the USB, thereby violating Policy 3.05 by reducing the quantity of water available to those customers; and
WHEREAS, the Project is located entirely outside the USB, would result in the addition of more than 100 residential units outside the USB, and is inconsistent with Policy 3.05, such that (1) the Project does not meet Policy 3.01's enumerated conditions for annexation of territory outside the USB, and (2) annexation of the Project would therefore be inconsistent with Policy 3.01; and
WHEREAS, because the Project is less than 200 units in size, is located outside the County's Urban Limit Line, and is inconsistent with Policy 3.01, it also does not comply with Policy 3.08; and

WHEREAS, the District has a legal obligation to provide adequate water service to all members of the community within its service area; and

5

WHEREAS, given the deficiencies in the District's water supplies in times of drought, the potential threats to those supplies, and the anticipated growth in water demand within the USB, the District cannot afford to dedicate any water available to it-including new water supplies created through water conservation programs-to a proposed development outside its current service area, and outside the USB;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Board of Directors of the East Bay Municipal Utility District finds, determines and declares the following:

1. The Board finds the above recitals to be true and correct.

2. The Board hereby finds and declares the District has not planned to serve the Project and does not have adequate water supplies to support the proposed annexation of the Project into the District's service area.

3. The Board hereby finds and declares the District must reserve all sources of water supply available to mitigate water supply deficiencies it experiences during droughts and to address the potential impacts of other stressors and constraints on its water supplies.

4. The Board hereby finds and declares that serving the Project using water created through implementation of conservation programs throughout the District's service area is not feasible because doing so would take a source of water supply away from existing and future customers within the USB, thereby exacerbating deficiencies in the District's water supplies during droughts.

5. The Board hereby finds and declares that the proposed annexation of the Project is inconsistent with District Policies 3.01 and 3.05 and does not comply with Policy 3.08.

6

6. The Board hereby declares the District (a) is opposed to annexing the Project into its service area and (b) does not intend to serve the Project.

ADVISORY ELECTION FOR ANNEXATIONS SUPERSEDES 14 OCT 08
OUTSIDE THE CONTRA COSTA COUNTY
URBAN LIMIT LINE

IT IS THE POLICY OF THE EAST BAY MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT TO:
Call an advisory election if EBMUD is designated as the preferred water service provider by a local planning agency in its environmental documentation when the proposed development is located outside the Urban Limit Line adopted by Contra Costa County in 2000.

Purpose The purpose of the election shall be to submit to the voters within the EBMUD
service area the question of whether territory outside said Urban Limit Line should
be annexed to EBMUD.

Events Triggering •
an Advisory EBMUD is identified by a local planning agency in its environmental
Election documentation as the preferred provider to deliver potable water service to a residential development of 200 or more dwelling units located in territory beyond the Contra Costa County Urban Limit Line. In such cases, the matter shall be placed on the agenda for consideration by the Board of Directors at a regularly scheduled public meeting. If the Board of Directors determines not to oppose annexation of such territory to EBMUD, EBMUD shall call an advisory election on the question of whether such territory should be annexed to EBMUD. The advisory election shall occur prior to the time the Contra Costa County Local Agency Formation Commission is scheduled to consider annexation of the territory to EBMUD and, when possible, shall be consolidated with a general election.

If a local agency designates EBMUD as the preferred provider for water service to a residential development in territory outside the Contra Costa County Urban Limit Line that is less than 200 dwelling units and is not covered by the provisions of Policy 3.01, then EBMUD shall oppose the annexation and the Board of Directors shall determine, at a regularly scheduled public meeting, whether to call an advisory election on the question of whether such territory should be annexed to EBMUD.

This policy shall be applied consistent with and in furtherance of the provisions of Policy 3.01 - Annexations.

RESOLUTION NO. 35222-21
1 DECLARING A STAGE 1 DROUGHT, ESTABLISHING A DISTRICT-WIDE VOLUNTARY
WATER USE REDUCTION GOAL OF TEN PERCENT, DECLARING THE NEED TO
PURCHASE SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPLIES FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY
PROJECT AND TO DIVERT SUCH SUPPLIES AT THE FREEPORT FACILITIES,
AND DIRECTING FURTHER MEASURES TO PROMOTE WATER CONSERVATION

Introduced by Director Coleman ; Seconded by Director Patterson

WHEREAS, dry conditions currently prevail throughout much of California, including within the Mokelumne River basin and the East Bay; and
WHEREAS, 2021 has thus far been the second driest year on record in the Mokelumne River
basin and the driest year on record for the East Bay; and
WHEREAS, the snow depth at Caples Lake, a Mokelumne basin snow survey reference point, is at 52 percent of average as of April 19, and the California Department of Water Resources' April Bulletin 120 forecast of the forecasted runoff on the Mokelumne River is at 43 percent of average; and
WHEREAS, the current weather forecast predicts precipitation within the Mokelumne River watershed which is below the historical median for the forecasted period, and long-term precipitation forecasting models do not currently predict a likelihood of above-normal precipitation during the remainder of the spring; and
WHEREAS, on March 22, 2021, the State Water Resources Control Board sent a warning letter to East Bay Municipal Utility District (District) and other water rights holders which noted the unusually dry conditions prevailing throughout California, and urged water rights holders to begin planning for potential water supply shortages by taking actions such as increasing water conservation and diversifying water supply portfolios; and
WHEREAS, the District has undertaken substantial investments in comprehensive water
conservation programs, water recycling projects, and dry year supplemental water supply projects to help reduce the severity of water rationing that may be required in multi-year droughts, and will continue doing so; and
WHEREAS, following adoption of its Water Conservation Master Plan in 1994 through the year 2018, the District achieved approximately 46 million gallons per day in estimated customer conservation savings and anticipates achieving up to 66 to 74 million gallons per day in
conservation savings by the year 2050; and

WHEREAS, the District provided recycled water customers with over 6 million gallons per day
of recycled water for nonpotable uses in 2020 and continues to pursue further expansions of its
recycled water program; and
WHEREAS, on April 27, 2021, the 2021 Water Supply Availability and Deficiency Report was
filed with the District's Board of Directors (Board) in accordance with District Policy 9.03, and

the Board declared the District's water supply will be deficient for meeting customer demand after all required releases to the Lower Mokelumne River have been made; and
WHEREAS, despite the District's long-running, aggressive water conservation program and its utilization of recycled water supplies, the current dry conditions and the District's deficient water supplies require consideration of customer water use reductions and the purchase of supplemental water supplies by the District; and
WHEREAS, the District's Water Shortage Contingency Plan and Drought Management Program provide recommendations regarding potential drought response actions to help the District
continue to meet customer water demand; and

WHEREAS, because precipitation has consistently trended well below the historical median for
an extended time, because concern is growing statewide regarding the ongoing dry conditions, and because it is important to use appropriately conservative water supply projections when formulating drought response actions, it is reasonable and prudent to project the District's end- of-September total system storage based upon the assumption that conditions in the Mokelumne watershed will remain dry relative to the historical median for the remainder of the precipitation season, as reflected by the 90 percent exceedance water supply projection; and
WHEREAS, on April 22, 2021, the District's projected end-of-September total system storage was 475,000 acre-feet based on a 90 percent exceedance; and
WHEREAS, the District's current Drought Management Program guidelines recommend declaration of a Stage 1 Drought whenever projected end-of-September total system storage falls between 450,000 acre-feet and 500,000 acre-feet; and
WHEREAS, the District's current Drought Management Program guidelines also recommend voluntary customer demand reductions of up to 15 percent in a Stage 1 Drought; and
WHEREAS, as part of its draft Water Shortage Contingency Plan 2020 currently out for public
review and comment, the District has proposed changes to its current Drought Management Program, referred to herein as the District's Proposed Drought Management Program; and
WHEREAS, when projected end-of-September total system storage falls between 425,000 acre- feet and 475,000 acre-feet, the Proposed Drought Management Program recommends declaration of a Stage 1 Drought, purchase of supplemental supplies, and voluntary customer demand reductions of up to 10 percent; and
WHEREAS, the drought response actions recommended in both the District's current and Proposed Drought Management Program are intended to guide, but not constrain, District drought response actions, particularly where the District's projected end-of-September total system storage approaches the total system storage thresholds demarcating the various drought stages set forth in the Drought Management Program; and

2

WHEREAS, given the current end-of-September total system storage projection of 475,000 acre- feet, it would be appropriate under the recommendations found in either the current or the Proposed Drought Management Program to: (i) declare E Stage 1 Drought, (ii) establish a District-wide voluntary 10 percent customer demand reduction goal and implement other voluntary measures to promote increased water conservation, and (iii) purchase supplemental
supplies; and
WHEREAS, the District has a permanent repayment contract with the United States Bureau of Reclamation under which the District is entitled to purchase Central Valley Project water as a supplemental supply in any contract year in which the District's May forecast of its October 1 total system storage is less than 500,000 acre-feet based on a 50 percent exceedance, or any different reasonable exceedance used by the District to declare rationing within its service area,
said supplemental supplies to be diverted at the Freeport Regional Water Project Facilities
(Freeport Facilities); and
WHEREAS, the District reasonably anticipates it will be entitled to take Central Valley Project
water during the 2021 contract year under the terms of its permanent repayment contract; and
WHEREAS, given the above-referenced dry conditions, the deficiency of available supplies, and
anticipated entitlement to take Central Valley Project water, the District intends to purchase up to
58,000 acre-feet of water under its Central Valley Project contract and divert the purchased water
at the Freeport Facilities during the current Central Valley Project contract year which ends on
February 28, 2022; and

WHEREAS, the District diverts its Central Valley Project supplies at the Freeport Facilities at the rate of approximately 8,300 acre-feet a month, and the additional cost to purchase, convey, treat, and deliver 8,300 acre-feet of Central Valley Project water is approximately $4 million per
month, resulting in an estimated $28 million cost associated with obtaining and delivering Central Valley Project water to the District's customers through the end of the current Central Valley Project contract year; and
WHEREAS, the District's Fiscal Year 2022 reserves are adequate to cover the estimated cost of purchasing, treating and delivering supplemental water supplies from the Central Valley Project in the remainder of Fiscal Year 2022; and
WHEREAS, the declaration of a Stage 1 Drought, establishment of a voluntary 10 percent customer demand reduction goal and other voluntary measures to promote water conservation, and acquisition of supplemental water supplies will enable the District to continue meeting the water supply needs of its customers;
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that the Board of Directors of the East Bay Municipal
Utility District finds and determines and hereby declares the following:

1. The Board finds the above recitals to be true and correct.

2. The Board hereby declares Stage 1 Drought.

co

3. The Board hereby establishes a District-wide voluntary 10 percent customer demand reduction goal.

4. The Board authorizes and directs District staff to review the proposed Stage Drought response actions described in the District's approved Water Shortage Contingency Plan and implement such actions described therein as staff deems appropriate, including initiating a public information campaign and offering expanded services which promote
customer water conservation.

5. The Board hereby declares a need to purchase up to 58,000 acre-feet of supplemental
water supplies from the United States Bureau of Reclamation during the current Central
Valley Project contract year and to use the Freeport Facilities to divert such supplies for
delivery to the District's service area.

6. The General Manager or his designee is hereby authorized and directed to take such other
actions as may be necessary to effectuate this Resolution.
