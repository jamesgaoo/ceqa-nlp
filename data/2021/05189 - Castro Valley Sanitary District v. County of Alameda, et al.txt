- Petitioner and Plaintiff CASTRO VALLEY SANITARY DISTRICT ("Petitioner" or
2 "CVSD"), a California public agency and sanitary district, respectfully petitions this Court for
issuance of a Writ of Mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP*) section 1094.5 and
4 Public Resources Code ("PRC*) section 21168, or in the alternative pursuant to CCP section 1085
5 and PRC section 21168.5, and complains for the issuance of temporary, preliminary and permanent
6 injunctive relief and for a declaration of rights pursuant to CCP sections 526 and 1060, directed at
Respondents and Defendants COUNTY OF ALAMEDA ("County") and BOARD OF
8 SUPERVISORS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA ("Board," and collectively with County and
9 Does 1-100, "Respondents"), as follows:

10

11

12 INTRODUCTION

1. Petitioner brings this action, on its own behalf and on behalf of the general public
13 and in the public interest, for judicial review and invalidation of the actions, determinations,
14 decisions, and approvals made by Respondents on or about December 15, 2020 relating to the
15 amendment of the Alameda County Zoning Code and the establishment of a new "Public Facilities"
16 ("PF") zoning district, creating and imposing new, unstudied, restrictions and limitations on the
17 permissible uses of properties and facilities owned by public agencies re-zoned into the newly-
18 created "Public Facilities" zoning district. Petitioner seeks relief from Respondents' actions and
19 approvals, including the Respondents' failure to comply with the California Environmental Quality
20| Act ("CEQA") (collectively referred to herein as the "Approvals"), and requests that Respondents
21 be enjoined from taking any further actions in furtherance of, or in implementation of, the
22 Approvals.

23 2. The Approvals included proposed amendments to the County Zoning Ordinance
24 (adding new "Chapter 17.51.060) governing zoning and permissible land uses of "public facilities"
25 and properties owned by public agencies, such as Petitioner, in the unincorporated portion of
26 Alameda County known as Castro Valley, and specifically include unlawful and invalid
27 amendments to the Zoning Ordinance at Sections 17.51.060 et seq. Those amendments, particularly
28 the PF zoning amendments, were adopted without any effort at compliance with the requirements

of CEQA, without consideration of adverse impacts on the environment, or impairment of critical
2 public health, safety, and emergency services to the local community, or impacts on regional
3 welfare; and which create inconsistencies and conflicts with the County's existing General Plan.

4 The challenged Approvals arbitrarily create new and unreasonable restrictions on the permissible
5 uses of publicly-owned or operated facilities, including facilities owned by Petitioner and other
6 public agencies providing critical services affecting public health, safety, and welfare.

7 3. The actions of Respondents adopting the Approvals were unlawful for numerous
8 reasons, as set forth below, including but not limited to Respondents' failure to comply with the
9 California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code sections 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"),
10 the California Government Code, and the County's own General Plan and Municipal Code.

11 4. In adopting the Approvals, the Respondents improperly and unlawfully relied upon
12 purported exemptions from CEQA review which were inapplicable, which were not supported by
13 substantial evidence in the record, and which were contrary to evidence in the record raising at least
14 a fair argument that the Approvals would result in significant adverse environmental impacts,
15 precluding reliance upon any categorical CEQA exemption and requiring further public
16 environmental review and analysis., in order to avoid conducting the legally-required review of the
17 Project's environmental impacts. As a result, the County failed to consider significant adverse
18 impacts of the Project, including impacts to the character of the neighborhood, aesthetics, parking,
19 sewer facilities, and fire safety, and improperly failed to consider possible mitigation measures or
20 feasible alternatives to the proposed Project as required by CEQA.

21 5. In addition, the Respondents' actions on the Approvals were in conflict with State
22 Planning and Zoning Law, as well as the County's own General Plan and Municipal Code by
23 adopting the Approvals despite uncontradicted evidence in the record that the new "PF" zoning as
24 adopted is inconsistent with the County's General Plan and zoning, and the existing lawful uses of
25 the impacted properties.

26 6. Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies, but Respondents have
27 persisted in acting in derogation of their obligations under CEQA and the Planning and Zoning Law,
28 and in derogation of the public's rights and interests in compliance with those laws. Petitioner now

brings this action in the public interest, for enforcement of the important public rights and
2 environmental interests intended to be protected by CEQA and for the enforcement of the State
3 Planning and Zoning Law, and the County's own General Plan, as well as statutory and
4 constitutional rights to due process and equal protection of the laws, and to assure compliance with
5 CEQA and other applicable provisions of law implicated by the Respondents' unlawful actions.

7 PARTIES

8 7. Petitioner/Plaintiff Castro Valley Sanitary District ("District') is a California public

9 sanitary district, established and existing under the provisions of the California Health & Safety
10 Code, which is governed by its own elected Board of Directors.

11 8. The District provides public sanitary services in the unincorporated Castro Valley
12 area of Alameda County, and owns property devoted to public safety, sanitary and emergency
13 services at two locations in the County. The District's existing headquarters facility is located at
14 21040 Marshall Street in Castro Valley, where it maintains offices and facilities for the operation,
15 maintenance, and parking of its vehicles and equipment. The District also acquired property located
16 at 21195 Center Street, in Castro Valley which was formerly owned by CalTrans and operated as a
17 service yard for CalTrans' vehicles and equipment. The District has publicly-announced its plans to
18 improve and renovate that property to serve as its future headquarters facility including both office
19 and equipment operations. Petitioner's properties were, at least prior to December 15, 2020,
20 properly zoned for such uses, including lawful office and service yard uses, without County zoning
21 restrictions on the type, size, weight, or number of axles of its vehicles.

22 9. Respondent/Defendant County is, and at all times mentioned herein was, a California
23| County and political subdivision of the State of California, organized and existing under the laws of
24 the State of California.

25 10. Respondent/Defendant County Board is the elected decision-making body of the
26 County that improperly adopted the invalid and unlawful Approvals challenged in this action.

27 11. The Respondents have and had a mandatory duty a to comply with the federal and
28 California Constitution, State legislation, including CEQA, and the Planning & Zoning Law, the

attorneys at law 2644/036121-0001 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR

H CEQA Guidelines, and with the County's own adopted General Plan and ordinances when
2 considering discretionary activities and land use regulatory actions such as the Approvals.

3 12. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of those sued herein as DOES

4 1 through 100, inclusive, and therefore sue those respondents/defendants by such fictitious names.
5 Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of these fictitiously named
6 | respondents/defendants when they have been ascertained. Petitioner designates all other unknown
persons or entities claiming any interests in the subject of this litigation as DOE
8 respondents/defendants.

10 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

11 13. This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to California Code of Civil
12 Procedure sections 1085, 1094.5, and 1060, and CEQA, including but not limited to Public
13 Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5.

14 14. Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394, in
15 that Respondents are located within the County of Alameda.

16

17 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

18 15. Petitioner is the public agency responsible for providing sanitary services in
19 designated portions of Alameda County in the Castro Valley area, including collection and transport
20 of waste, and untreated sewage effluent from its service area to the Oro Loma/Castro Valley
21 | treatment facilities in San Lorenzo. The District's services include emergency and time-critical
22 responses to spills, breaks, blockages and other incidents which otherwise endanger the public health
23 and safety, and it is therefore critical that the District's facilities and equipment are located so as to
24 provide expeditious and efficient service and responses. In order to provide such services and
25 responses the District parks and maintains its vehicles and equipment at its facilities in the middle
26 of its Castro Valley service area. The District has provided these services to its served community
27 for many years and has been recognized by the State Association of Sanitary and Sanitation Districts
28 for its achievements and record of outstanding public service.

15938019.3 a01/08/21 DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 16. At all times prior to the Respondents' actions on the challenged Approvals in
2 December 2020, the District's property and facilities have been planned and zoned to accommodate
3 and allow the District to lawfully use its property and facilities for the above-described public
4 sanitary services and operations without any special or discretionary County permission or approval.
5 So far as Petitioner is aware, there has been no history of public complaint nor claim of public
6 nuisance directed at Petitioner's use or operation of its facilities.

17. The County adopted its current Castro Valley General Plan ("CVGP") in 2012, as
8 provided by the California Planning and Zoning Law, and that General Plan expressly recognizes
9 the existence and importance of various public agencies and special districts providing services to
10 the various communities in Alameda County, including the District. The CVGP designates the
11 Petitioner's properties for their current uses, without restrictions on use of those properties for
12 service yard use or restrictions on the type or size of vehicles that may be maintained.

13 18. The General Plan recommended that the County consider the establishment of a new
14 type of "public facility" zoning district to encompass properties owned or operated by public
15 agencies or districts while preserving "the existing public facility uses" of those properties. The
16 record indicates that the stated purpose for considering such a new Public Facilities zoning district
17 was to provide that properties currently owned by public agencies would remain in public ownership
18 and use, and to provide the County with a means of limiting the possible transfer of such sites to
19 private ownership or use, rather than as a means of imposing new restrictions on the existing uses
20 of such sites by public agencies.

21 19. At or about the time of the County's approval of the 2012 CVGP, the County also
22 certified an environmental impact report ("EIR") purporting to address the impacts or potential
23 impacts of the new General Plan. Since there was nothing in the CVGP itself indicating any
24 / possibility or intent to create or add new restrictions on the existing public facility uses of such sites
25 as may be redesignated or rezoned into a prospective new "PF" zone, that EIR did not address or
26 provide any evidence or analysis of the potential impacts of such new restrictions on use of PF
27  properties.

28 20. Following the adoption of the County's 2012 General Plan, Petitioner is informed

Rutan & Tucker, LLP -6-
attorneys et law 2644/036121-0001 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
15938019.3 a01/08/21 DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

and believes, and thereon alleges, that the County took steps to implement the recommendations
2 and policies of the General Plan, and established a "Castro Valley General Plan Implementation
3 Program." That Implementation Program included the drafting of proposed amendments to the

4 Castro Valley zoning ordinances. The County's planning consultant issued a report on the CVGP
5 Implementation Program on January 27, 2017, which reaffirmed to the public that the purpose of
6 the proposed establishment of a new PF zoning district, which would be made applicable to existing

7 public properties, was merely to re-zone "existing public facility uses to the new PF zone," with no
8 mention of possibly creating or adding any new restrictions on the uses of such properties as may
9 | be rezoned to the PF designation.

10 21. Petitioner monitored and participated in the CVGP Implementation Process, and
11 Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the Implementation Process did not
12 contemplate or give any public notice of any intention to create or add any new restrictions on the

13 existing public facility uses of such properties as may be rezoned to the PF designation at any time
14 prior to late 2019 or early 2020. To the contrary, Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon
15 alleges, that the first such public suggestion of creating new restrictions on the use of public property
16 that may be placed under the "PF" zoning, such as the District's properties, did not arise until the
17 proposed Castro Valley zoning amendments were presented by County Planning Staff to the Castro
18 Valley Municipal Advisory Commission ("CVMAC") in early 2020.

19 22. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that one or more individuals
20 I who were then appointees to the CVMAC suggested that the proposed new PF zoning amendments
21 should be changed so as to include new restrictions on the existing and permissible uses of existing
22 public agency facilities, and to impose arbitrary new limits on the size and type of vehicles that
23 public agencies could park or maintain on the properties. Petitioner further alleges that no evidence,
24 analysis, or reasonable justification was presented during the CVMAC process to demonstrate that
25 such new restrictions would promote any legitimate public interests or be consistent with the CVGP
26 Implementation Program.

27 23. Petitioner, and others, timely and repeatedly objected to the proposed new
28 restrictions on the existing uses of their property and other properties proposed for inclusion in the

Rutan & Tucker, LLP -7-
attorneys at law 2644/036121-0001 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
15938019.3 a01/08/21 DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

new PF zoning districts. Such objections were presented in writing and verbally by appearances at

2 the ensuing public hearings on the proposed zoning amendments during 2020, including hearings
3 before the CVMAC, the County Planning Commission, and the County Board of Supervisors.

4 24. True and correct copies of some of the Petitioner's written comments on and
5 objections to the proposed Approvals are attached hereto, and marked as Exhibits, and are
6 incorporated herein by reference [exhibits filed under separate cover].

7 25. In or about September 2020, the County provided notice that its Planning
8 Commission would consider recommending the proposed Zoning Amendments on September 8,
9 2020. The staff report for that hearing acknowledged that "the CVMAC recommended service yard
10 and vehicle weight restrictions in the PF zone that precludes service yards and vehicles over 14,000
11  lbs. Gross Vehicle Weight (GVW)." Petitioner, and others, timely objected and submitted written
12 objections pointing out Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA, the inapplicability of any

13 categorical exemption from CEQA, and the violation of state planning and zoning law.

14 26. The County Planning Commission hearing on the proposed Zoning Amendments
15 was subsequently continued for hearing by the Planning Commission on October 5, 2020. Petitioner
16 and others again submitted written objections, pointing out that the PF zoning amendments were not
17 consistent with the CVGP, and that the County's failure to comply with CEQA was not excused by
18 reliance on CEQA Guideline 15183 as had been previously suggested. The County Staff report for
19 the October 5, 2020, Planning Commission hearing candidly acknowledged such deficiencies in the
20 proposed PF zoning restrictions:

21 Staff believes the language proposed to limit service yards in the

22 PF zone, and the restrictions on vehicle weight, do not have a firm basis

23 in the CVGP, as there is no language in the document that mentions

24 anything about limiting certain aspects of the use that may be found to

25 be objectionable. The same could be said for the restriction only apply

26 to some service yards and not to others, as the impacts would be

27 similar. Along similar lines, the exception of public safety trucks and

28 equipment may be similar in nature to the trucks and equipment used

Rutan & Tucker, LLP -8-

15938019.3 a01/08/21 DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 by others.

2 27. Despite this admonition by the County's own Staff, the Planning Commission voted
3 to recommend that the Board of Supervisors approve the zoning amendments, including restrictions

4 on the use of PF properties, and including the prohibition on (undefined) "service yard" uses in the
5 PF zone. The Planning Commission also made a proposed amendment changing the restriction on

6 vehicles from a "weight" restriction to a newly-invented restriction based on the number of axles on

7 vehicles, i.e., no more than two (2) vehicles having three (3) or more axles.

8 28. The proposed zoning amendments were then presented to the County Board of
9 Supervisors for hearing, as revised by the Planning Commission including the challenged PF zoning
10 restrictions described above, was set for a "Zoom" type of hearing on December 15, 2020. The
11 proposed action as described in the notice, agenda, and Staff Report included the new amendments
12 to the proposed PF zoning, including the newly-revised restrictions on the use of PF-zoned
13 properties as changed and recommended by the Planning Commission. Respondents did not provide
14 any environmental analysis, nor any study of the impacts of the newly-revised conditions and
15 restrictions on the use of PF-zoned properties to the public before or during the Board hearing.
16 While the Planning Commission proposed that the new PF zoning should be amended to prohibit
17 "service yard" uses, it did not provide any definition of "service yard" uses, thereby arbitrarily
18 creating a vague, ambiguous, and unreasonable prohibition on existing and otherwise lawful uses of
19| property owned by public agencies, including Petitioner.

20 29. Moreover, the Planning Commission also recommended that the PF zoning
21 restrictions should include an exception in favor of public safety vehicles and equipment such as
22 fire departments and other unspecified emergency service providers, but arbitrarily failed to describe
23 Petitioner and Petitioner's services as being within that exception. Respondents failed to provide
24 any evidence, analysis, or other justification for that action.

25 30. The County Staff report, dated December 7, 2020, again failed to include any CEQA
26 analysis of the proposed Approvals, and instead asserted the Approvals should be "exempt" from
27 CEQA compliance, simply because the County had certified an EIR when it adopted the CVGP
28 back in 2012 - and even though that EIR had not addressed the impacts of the proposed new

Rutan & Tucker, LLP -9-
attorneys at law 2644/036121-0001 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
15938019.3 a01/08/21 DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 restrictions on existing uses in the proposed new PF zoning. The Staff Report no longer cited CEQA

2 Guideline 15183 as the purported justification for the failure to provide any CEQA review, but

3 simply asserted, without authority: "As an implementation of a General Plan for which an EIR was
4 certified, there is no additional environmental review required."

5 31. Petitioner, and others, again objected to the proposed PF zoning restrictions,
6 including the Planning Commission's newly-revised restrictions described above, and to the failure
7 of the Respondents to provide any CEQA analysis or any evidence justifying those restrictions or
8 showing any reasonable relationship between those restrictions and the public health, safety,

9 or welfare.

10 32. Petitioner's staff testified (via Zoom) in opposition to the proposed PF restrictions,
11 however, the Petitioner's legal counsel was prevented from being heard by the Board, apparently
12 due to "technical difficulties" with the remote telephone connections.

13 33. During the course of the Board hearing, the proposed PF zoning amendments were
14 again amended, so as to add a new, previously-unstudied, requirement that precludes "service yard"
15 uses on properties in the PF zone, in the absence of a conditional use permit. The impacts of such
16 a new, discretionary, permit requirement (without any stated criteria for issuance of such a CUP) a
17 had not previously been considered by the County or by the public, nor was any evidence cited as
18 justifying the proposed creation of a new discretionary permit requirement for service yard uses of
19 PF property, or for arbitrarily exempting (undefined) public safety vehicles and equipment from
20 such permit requirements. No statute or CEQA Guideline was cited as justification for the failure

21 to provide any CEQA analysis for the Board's action on the Approvals.

22 34. Despite the foregoing facts showing inconsistencies with the 2012 General Plan, the
23 absence of substantial evidence to justify the arbitrary and discriminatory new restrictions on the
24  uses of PF-zoned properties, or the arbitrary exemptions from such new restrictions, and legal
25 deficiencies in the process, the Respondent Board voted to adopt the Approvals, and to dispense
26 with any CEQA review of the new zoning amendments.

27 35. The Respondents failed to address, and failed to provide any evidence or analysis in
28 the record addressing CEQA Guideline 15300.2, which limits reliance on categorical exemptions

Rutan & Tucker, LLP -10-
attorneys al lew 2644/036121-0001 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR

from CEQA review, and which provides an exception to such exemptions: "A categorical
2 exemption shall not be used where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a
3 significant effect on the environment." There was substantial evidence in the record at the Board

4 hearing demonstrating such a reasonable possibility of significant, but unstudied, environmental

5 impacts, or raising at least a fair argument that the Approvals would have a significant effect on the
6 environment, requiring more detailed CEQA review. The County failed to provide substantial
7 evidence in the record to support its implied, but tacit, determination that these exceptions to the
8 proposed CEQA exemptions were not applicable.

9 36. Despite the evidence demonstrating the Approvals, and new restrictions on the

10 existing uses of PF-zoned property would have significant environmental impacts that the County
11 had failed to consider or mitigate and raising a fair argument that such impacts were possible, the
12 County Board erroneously determined that the Zoning Amendments were "exempt from review*
13 under CEQA, and unlawfully adopted the Approvals on December 15, 2020.

14 37. Petitioner has timely exhausted all available administrative remedies prior to filing
15 this action for judicial relief from the Respondents' actions and Approvals.

16

17 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Petition for Writ of Mandate for Violations of CEQA)

19 38. Petitioner hereby incorporates the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though
20 set forth in full herein by this reference.

21 39. Pursuant to CEQA, before a public agency approves any discretionary project or
22 action, the agency must first identify, assess and publicly disclose the project's potential
23 environmental effects. An agency may not approve a discretionary action that has the potential to
24 have significant environmental impacts if there are feasible alternatives or mitigation measures that
25 would avoid or substantially lessen the adverse environmental impacts.
26 40. In doing the things herein alleged, Respondents failed to comply with their
27 mandatory duties under CEQA in several substantial and prejudicial respects, including without
28 limitation, the following:

15938019.3 a01/08/21 DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- 41. Respondents failed to conduct any CEQA review whatsoever prior to adopting the
2 Approvals, and unlawfully asserted that the Approvals were "exempt" from CEQA review.

3 42. Respondents failed to provide substantial evidence in the public record prior to its
4 decision to exempt the Approvals from CEQA review sufficient to support such decision.

5 43. Respondents erroneously relied on inapplicable CEQA exemptions, and as a result
6 failed to consider, disclose, or mitigate the significant environmental impacts and potential impacts
7 of the Approvals, as required by CEQA.

8 44.

0 Respondents erroneously failed to publicly consider or provide evidence in the public
record addressing the CEQA Guideline 15300.2 exception or other exceptions to the County's
10 proposed reliance upon categorical or statutory exemptions from CEQA review.

11 45.

12 Had such an evaluation been conducted, it would have revealed that the Approvals
will have significant adverse impacts that the County failed to disclose or mitigate prior to approving
13 the new restrictions on the permissible uses of PF-zoned properties. Many such unstudied impacts

14

15 were called to Respondents' attention by Petitioner's written and verbal objections.

46. Respondents failed to make required findings when acting on the Approvals and/or
16 any findings made were not supported by substantial evidence in light of the whole record.

17 47. Respondents' apparent reliance on the EIR prepared with the 2012 CVGP was
18 erroneous and unjustified since that EIR failed to address the particular circumstances and impacts
19 of the newly-contrived restrictions on use of PF-zoned properties, the Approvals are not consistent
20 with the CVGP, and Respondents' reliance on Guideline 15183, or any other exemption for CEQA
21 compliance was unjustified and unlawful.

22 48.

23 Respondents failed to consider feasible alternatives to the new PF zoning restrictions,

24 or to consider feasible mitigation measures for the impacts of those restrictions.

49. Respondents' actions in approving the Project were not in compliance with
25 procedures required by law, were not supported by substantial evidence in the public record, were
26 not reflected in legally adequate findings, and were arbitrary, capricious, and reflected a prejudicial
27 abuse of discretion.

1 property that will be subject to the newly-created PF zoning and the new restrictions, and will be

2 directly and significantly impacted by the arbitrary and unreasonable restrictions.

3 51. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this action and
4 has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law by, inter
5 alia, submitting written and oral comments objecting to the Approvals and the failure to comply
6 with CEQA at each stage of the County's administrative process. To the extent any matter raised in
7 this Petition was not addressed in Petitioner's comments, Petitioner is informed and believes that

8 such matters were raised by other persons or entities who objected to the Project, or that Petitioner

0 had no effective opportunity to raise such comments before the complained of actions were taken,
10 or that Petitioner was otherwise excused from or not obligated to raise such issues before pursuing
11 them in this action.

12 52. Pursuant to PRC section 21167.5, Petitioner has provided written notice of the
13 commencement of this action to Respondents.

14 53. Pursuant to PRC section 21167.7, and CCP section 388, Petitioner has or will
15 provide written notice of this action, including a copy of this Petition, to the State Attorney General.
16 54. Petitioner brings this action pursuant to PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5 and Code
17 of Civil Procedure sections 1085, 1088.5 and 1094.5, which require that an agency's approval of a
18 project be set aside if the agency has prejudicially abused its discretion, or has acted arbitrarily and
19 capriciously. Prejudicial abuse of discretion occurs where the County has failed to proceed in the
20 manner required by law, the decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are not
21 supported by the evidence.

22 55. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and/or 1085, a writ of mandate
23 should issue directing Respondents to rescind the Approvals, at least as to the new PF zoning
24 restrictions in Chapter 17.50.060 described above, and to rescind the unjustified claim of exemption
25 from CEQA review, invalidating any and all purported Approvals, ordinances, amendments, or
26 actions based on such inadequate CEQA review, and prohibiting Respondents from taking any
27 subsequent action to implement or enforce the Approvals, unless and until they have complied with

4 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (Petition for Writ of Mandate for Violation of the Planning and Zoning Law, and

6 Inconsistency with the Castro Valley General Plan)

7 56. Petitioner hereby incorporates the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though
8 set forth in full herein by this reference.

9 57. The California Planning & Zoning Law (Government Code §§ 65860 et seq.)
10 requires that all land use actions be shown to be consistent with the applicable general plan. This

11 requirement of consistency with the applicable General Plan applies to zoning amendments, such as
12 the challenged Approvals in this action. Government Code section 65860, subdivision

13 (a) specifically requires zoning ordinances to "be consistent with the general plan of the county or
14 city." Any change to a zoning ordinance that would make it inconsistent with the general plan, such

15 as the new PF zoning restrictions, is void ab initio. (Lesher Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut
16 Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 544; City of Morgan Hill v. Bushey (2018) 5 Cal.5th 1068, 1075.)

17 58. Respondents failed to provide any evidence, much less substantial evidence, in the
18 record, and failed to make findings purporting to show that the proposed PF zoning amendments
19 and restrictions would be consistent with the applicable Castro Valley General Plan as adopted in
20 2012, or would in any way promote the achievement of the General Plan's goals and objectives.

21 59. As noted above, the County Staff report for the October 5, 2020, Planning
22 Commission hearing admitted that there was no support for the proposed PF zoning restrictions in
23 the CVGP: "Staff believes the language proposed to limit service yards in the PF zone, and the
24 restrictions on vehicle weight, do not have a firm basis in the CVGP, as there is no language in the
25 document that mentions anything about limiting certain aspects of the use that may be found to be

26 objectionable."

27 60. The challenged Approvals, particularly the new restrictions on uses of PF-zoned
28 property, are inconsistent with several fundamental General Plan policies and programs in the

Rutan & Tucker, LLP -14-
attorneys at law 2644/036121-0001 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
15938019.3 a01/08/21 DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 County's Castro Valley General Plan as adopted in 2012, including but not limited to the following:

2 a. Chapter 9 of the CVGP 9 ["Ch. 9 Public Services and Utilities."] expressly
3 recognizes the significance of public agencies and special districts like Petitioner. The capacity and
4 quality of public services, utilities and infrastructure significantly affect the quality of life enjoyed
5 by those who live, work, and own property in Castro Valley. In addition to the community facilities
6 discussed in Chapter 8, the basic urban services and utilities include: roads; flood management
7 including drainage, erosion and siltation control; water supply and service; gas and electric power;
8 wastewater management; solid waste collection, recycling, and disposal; police services; and fire
9 protection services. Many of these services require substantial investment in infrastructure that is
10 a major factor in determining the amount, location, and type of growth that a community can
11 anticipate. Service adequacy will also affect its ability to attract the kind of new development that
12 Castro Valley residents and business owners would like to see in the future. This Chapter provides
13 policies and proposals to ensure that the public services and utilities the community relies on will
14 have the capacity to serve new development under the General Plan without degrading existing
15  service levels...."

16 b. Section 9.4 Wastewater Collection and Treatment Collection and Treatment

17 Systems. "The Castro Valley Sanitary District (CVSD) provides and maintains the sewage

18 collection system that serves most of Castro Valley. CVSD's current service area includes virtually
19 all of the land within the voter-approved Urban Growth Boundary…... Section 9.6 Solid Waste. The
20 Castro Valley Sanitary District (CVSD) and the Oro Loma Sanitary District (OLSD) handle refuse
21 collection and disposal in the planning area...."

22 C. Chapter 9 of the CVGP also embodies the major objective of providing and
23 protecting existing public facilities uses and ensuring adequate public services: "ADEQUATE
24 PUBLIC SERVICES GOAL" at Chapter 9: "GOAL 9.1-1: Provide public services and utilities
25 that are designed, located, and sized to serve existing and future development."

26 d. The challenged Approvals are also inconsistent with numerous other policies
27 and programs of the CVGP, including without limitation:

28 1. Policy 8.1-2: Identification of Program and Service Needs. Work with public

Rutan & Tucker, LLP -15-

P agencies that provide community facilities and services to identify the program and
2 service needs of all segments of the community.
3 2. Policy 8.1-3: Design and Location of Programs and Facilities: Design and

4 locate programs and facilities in a manner that will maximize access while avoiding

5 over-concentration that may result in adverse impacts such as traffic and noise.

6 3. Policy 8.1-7 Public Ownership of Public Facilities: Where feasible retain all

7 publicly-owned public service facilities in public ownership and maintain their use

8 for the public benefit;
4o 4. Policy 4.4.4 [Ensure that land designated for provision of public utilities and

10 services is appropriately located];
11 5. Action 4.4.4 [Public Facilities Zoning District. Establish a Public Facilities

12 Zoning District that would apply to existing and proposed public and institutional

13 uses such as Eden Medical Center];

14 6. Policy 4.9-1 [Maintain Sites for Community and General Commercial.

15 Identify and maintain sufficient appropriately-located areas to meet the needs of

16 residents and businesses for auto-reliant general retail and service use];

17 7. Policy 4.9-2 [Commercial Sites along I-580. Sites adjacent to I-580 entrances

18 and exits with frontage on major arterials shall be retained for general commercial

19 uses such as gasoline service station, storage, auto repair, and auto-reliant

20 commercial uses.

21 8. Policy 4.9-4 Office and Storage Uses along I-580. [Locate office and storage
22 uses between I-580 or other arterials and adjacent residential neighborhoods, so those

23 uses serve as a buffer between roadways and adjacent residential neighborhoods.];
24 9. Policy 9.1-1 Basic Public Services. [All development within the Castro
25 Valley urban area shall be provided with adequate basic urban services and
26 facilities];

27 10. Policy 9.1-2 Existing Public Service Agencies. [Basic urban services to new

28 development shall be provided by existing public service agencies];

1 11.

2 Policy 9.1-4 Land for Public Services. [Ensure that appropriately located

u A w land is designated for provision of public utilities and services];

12. Policy 9.1-5 Fairness in Provision of Public Services. [Promote equity in the
provision of public facilities and services working with public agencies that provide
public facilities and services to create and expand opportunities, facilities, programs,

7 and services to meet the needs of all segments of the community a in a manner that

8 will increase and enhance the quality of life for all Castro Valley residents ...];

13.

9 Goal 9.4-1 [Ensure the availability of adequate and effective wastewater

10 collection and treatment to protect public health and safety];

14.

11 Policy 9.4-1 Coordination with Sanitary Districts. [Continue to coordinate

12 with the Castro Valley Sanitary District and Oro Loma Sanitary District to provide

13 for collection, transfer, treatment, and disposal of wastewater from existing and
proposed development in the Castro Valley planning area];

14 15.

15 Policy 10.2-4 Reduce Pollution: [Protect surface water quality by reducing

16 61. the release of non-point source pollutants into storm drain system and waterways.]
"A zoning ordinance must bear a substantial and reasonable relationship to the public
17 welfare, and an arbitrary and discriminatory zoning decision is an invalid exercise of the police
18 power. (Arnel Development Co. v. City of Costa Mesa (1981) 126 Cal.App.3d 330, 336-337.)"
19 (Merritt v. City of Pleasanton (2001) 89 Cal.App.4th 1032, 1036.)

20 62. Respondents failed to provide any evidence, much less substantial evidence, in the
21 public record purporting to show that the proposed PF zoning amendments and restrictions
22 arbitrarily limiting the uses of publicly-owned properties, or arbitrarily limiting the size or number

23 of axles on public agency service vehicles at such PF properties, or requiring a conditional use
24 permit in order to conduct (undefined) "service yard" uses, or exempting fire departments (but not
25 expressly exempting Petitioner) from such permit requirements, would bear a substantial and
26 reasonable relationship to the public welfare.

27 63. To the contrary, the proposed PF amendments would unreasonably and arbitrarily
28 impair the ability of Petitioner -and other public service agencies - to continue to provide efficient

-
and responsive services to the Castro Valley community.

2 64. A zoning amendment "must comply with the requirement that it be substantially and
3 reasonably related to the welfare of the region affected." (Arnel Development Co. v. City of Costa

4 Mesa (1980) 28 Cal.3d 511, 524; Associated Home Builders etc. V. City of Livermore (1976)

5 18 Cal.3d 582, 609.)

6 65. Respondents failed to provide any evidence, much less substantial evidence, in the

7 public record purporting to show that the new restrictions in the PF zoning amendments would in
8 any way promote the regional welfare.

9 66. It is unlawful for zoning actions to arbitrarily discriminate against certain properties
10 or property owners. (Arnel Development Co. V. City of Costa Mesa (1980) 28 Cal.3d 511, 524.)

11 67. The record demonstrates that the new constraints on uses of PF- zoned properties,
12 and Petitioner's properties, would unfairly and irrationally discriminate against the property recently
13 acquired by Petitioner from CalTrans, in violation of the laws limiting the use of the zoning power.

14 68. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and/or 1094.5, a writ of mandate
15 should issue directing Respondents to rescind the Approvals, and prohibiting Respondents from
16 taking any action implementing or enforcing any aspect of the new PF zoning restrictions, and
17 enjoining the Respondents from taking any action to implement the challenged Approvals.

18

19 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (Declaratory and Injunctive Relief)

21 69. Petitioner hereby incorporates the allegations of the foregoing paragraphs as though
22 set forth in full herein by this reference.

23 70. An actual controversy exists between Petitioner and Respondents regarding
24 Respondents' Approvals as set forth above, in particular the approval of arbitrary new restrictions

25 on the uses of property, like Petitioner's, that may be subject to new PF zoning, and the failure of
26 Respondents to comply with CEQA.

27 71. Petitioner contends that Respondents' Approvals violate state law, including CEQA
28 and the State Planning and Zoning Law, as well as the County's own General Plan, as described

-18- Rutan & Tucker, LLP
attorneys al lew 2644/036121-0001 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
15938019.3 a01/08/21 DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

above.

2 72. Petitioner further contends that Respondents actions in adopting the Approvals were
3 arbitrary, unreasonable, discriminatory, and without any evidence demonstrating a reasonable or a

4 rational basis. Petitioner contends that Respondents unlawfully denied constitutional rights to equal
5 protection of the law and due process to Petitioner and to others similarly situated.

6 73. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that Respondents deny

7 Petitioner's claims and contend to the contrary.

8 74. Accordingly declaratory relief is appropriate and necessary to determine the parties'

9 respective rights and obligations with regard to the Approvals. To remedy Respondents' violations
10 of law, as described above, Petitioner seeks a declaration that Respondents' actions on the Approvals

11 were invalid and contrary to law. Such a declaration is a necessary and proper exercise of the
12 Court's power to prevent future actions by Respondents' in violation of the law.

13 75. Petitioner is informed and believe, and thereon allege, that any implementation of
14 the Approvals by Respondents will cause irreparable and permanent harm to Petitioner, and to others
15 similarly situated and impacted by the Approvals, and will be detrimental to the public at large as
16 set forth above.

17 76. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law to prevent or mitigate the imminent harm
18 and actions described above, and therefore issuance of preliminary and permanent injunctive relief

19 is necessary to restrain and enjoin Respondents from in any way seeking to implement the Approvals
20 and other actions, pending final resolution of this action.

21

22 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

23 WHEREFORE, Petitioner respectfully prays for judgment as follows:

24 1. For a Writ of Mandate:

25 a. Directing Respondents, and each of them, to rescind and set aside the
26 Approvals, particularly the approvals of the new PF zoning restrictions in Chapter 17.50.060
27 identified above, and to rescind the assertion that the Approvals are exempt from CEQA review;

28 b. Commanding Respondents to refrain from taking any further actions in

1 furtherance or implementation of the PF zoning amendments; and

2 C. Commanding Respondents to prepare an initial study, and an environmental
3 impact report and circulate it for public review and comment, consistent with the requirements of
4 CEQA, and to comply with all other requirements of CEQA, prior to taking any subsequent action

5 on the proposed PF zoning amendments;

6 2. For the declaratory relief requested above, including a declaration of the invalidity

7 of the Approvals and the invalidity of the new PF zoning restrictions;

8 3. For preliminary injunctive relief ordering the Respondents to refrain from
9 implementing or enforcing the Approvals, or the PF zoning restrictions, while this action is pending;

10 4. For a permanent injunction ordering the Respondents to refrain from implementing
11 or enforcing the Approvals, or the PF zoning restrictions, pending Respondents' full compliance
12 with CEQA and otherwise conforming their actions with the procedural mandates of the law;

13 5. For an award of reasonable attorney's fees, litigation expenses, and costs as permitted
14 or required by law, including but not limited to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, Government
15 Code section 800, and other statutory and common law; and

16 6. For such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.
