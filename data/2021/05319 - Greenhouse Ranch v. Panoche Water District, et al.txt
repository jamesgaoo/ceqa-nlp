PETITIÓN FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Petitioner and Plaintiff Greenhouse Ranch ("Petitioner" or "Greenhouse") submits this

S 2 Petition for a Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory Relief and Injunctive Relief, stating claims
3 against Respondents and Defendants Panoche Water District ("PWD") and Stevinson Water District
4 ("SWD") (collectively, "Respondents"), as set forth below.

5 INTRODUCTION

6 1. This action challenges actions by SWD, PWD, East Side Canal & Irrigation Company
transfers of water from the Merced 7 (*ESCC"), and San Luis Canal Company ("SLCC") to approve
8 groundwater sub-basin to a different sub-basin in Fresno County via Petitioner's property (the
.1 9 "Project"), without conducting any environmental review under the California Environmental Quality
10 Act, Public Resources Code, § 21000, et seq. ("CEQA"). To justify the transfers, SWD and PWD both

11 claimed the transfers were exempt from CEQA. None of these purported exemptions are applicable,
12 ll and SWD and PWD must prepare an environmental impact report before transferring any water.

13 2. Petitioner thus seeks: (1) a writ of mandate pursuant to Sections 21080 and 21080.5 of
14 the Public Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure setting aside
15 certain decisions made by Respondents described below and to enforce compliance with CEQA; (2) a
16 declaratory judgment pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code of Civil Procedure; and (3) injunctive relief
17 pursuant to Sections 525-526 of the Code of Civil Procedure to obtain compliance with CEQA.

18 PARTIES. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

19 3. Petitioner is a California general partnership formed under the laws of the State of

20 California. Petitioner owns certain real property located in the County of Merced, more commonly
21 known as Merced County Assessor's Parcel Nos. ("APN") 065-030-006, 065-030-009, 065-00-016,
22 065-0500-017, and 065-050-018 (the "Property"), that is used for waterfowl habitat, hunting, and cattle
23 grazing. The water transfer per the Project will use siphons under the East Side Bypass that fall within
24  the Property.

25 4. The environment, including Petitioner's Property, will be negatively affected by the
26 proposed Project, which seeks to utilize a large electrified pump station to pump the water through the
27 siphons. This will generate significant noise impacts that will decrease the viability of the Property as
28 habitat for waterfowl and other species; the damage and destruction of levees on the Property from water

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

conveyance down the East Side Canal, due to which Petitioner has already incurred significant cost for
2 repairs; and result in the increased usage of the East Side Bypass, which will degrade the use of the

3 Property as a recreation area.

4 5. The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial beuefit on the

5 public by protecting the public from the environmental and other harms alleged herein and by ensuring
6 that Respondents abide by the procedures required under law in approving projects like the one at issue.
7 "Petitioner is beneficially interested in this matter because it has a direct interest in ensuring that
8 Respondents fulfill their duties to comply with CEQA and the Government Code.

9 6. Respondent Panoche Water District is a California Water District, formed pursuant toi
10 Water Code section 34000, et seq., with its headquarters in the City of Firebaugh, County of Fresño,
11 California, PWD is named as Respondent because it approved the Project without conducting any
12  environmental review under CEQA.

13 7. Respondent Stevinson Water District is a California Water District, formed pursuant to*

14 Water Code section 34000, et seq., with its headquarters in the County of Merced, California. SWD isi
15 named as Respondent because it approved the Project without conducting any environmental review

16 under CEQA, and filed a Notice of Exemption purporting to rely upon three inapplicable exemptions:

17 1 Class 1 [Existing Facilities], (CEQA Guidelines, § 15301); Class 4 [Minor Alterations of Land], (CEQA
18 Guidelines, § 15304); and the so-called "Common Sense" Exemption. (CEQA Guidelines, c0
19 15061(b)(3).)

20 8. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that Real Party In Interest
21. East Side Canal & Irrigation Company ("ESCC") is, and at all times herein mentioned was, a California
22. corporation organized and existing under the lawg of the State of California, regularly doing business in
23 the County of Fresno, California.

24 9. Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that Real Party in Interest
25* San Luis Canal Company ("SLCC") is a California Mutual Water Company organized and existing
26 under the laws of the State of California, with its headquarters in the city of Dos Palos, County of

:27 Merced, California.

8 Defendants DOES 1 through 25, inclusive.

11. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest
10 fictitiously named Does 26 through 50 and therefore sues such real parties in interest by fictitious names.

11 Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the fictitiously named real parties in
12 winterest are also responsible for the actions described in this Petition. When the true identities and

13 capacities of these real parties in interest have been determined, Petitioner will amend this petition, with

14 leave of the court if necessary, to insert such identities and capacities. Whenever the terms "Real Parties

15 in Interest," "SLCC," and "ESCC" are used herein, said terms shall be construed as including Real
16 Parties in Interest DOES 26 through 50, inclusive.

17 12. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition.
18 As to PWD, Petitioner was not required to exhaust the administrative remedies pursuant to Public

19 Resources Code Section 21177, subd. (a), because the public agency, PWD, did not give notice of the

20 ground for its exemption determination. (Tomlinson v. Cty. of Alameda (2012) 54 Cal.4th 281, 291.)

21 As to SWD, Petitioner objected to the Project and submitted two letters to SWD in advance of SWD's

22 March 9, 2021, hearing on the Project,

23 13. Petitioner complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by
24 mailing written notice of this action to Respondents. Copies of the letters providing written notice to
25. Respondents, and proof of service of those letters, are attached hereto as Exhibits "A" and "B."

26 14. Petitioner complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by concurrently filing
27 a request concerning the preparation of the record of administrative proceedings relating to this action,

10 Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394 because
Respondent SWD is a local agency and is located in the County of Merced. re.

11 17. STATEMENT OF FACTS
On November 24, 2020, Respondent PWD conducted a public meeting at which it
12 approved a Purchase Agreement for Water Transfer Between East Side Canal & Irrigation Company, N
13 Panoche Water District, and San Luis Canal Company (the "Purchase Agreement"). The purpose of the
14 Purchase Agreement was to transfer up to 5,000 acre-feet of surface water from SWD and BSCC tol
15 SLCC, and then to PWD, PWD did not perform any environmental review for the Purchase Agreement.

16 18. PWD approved the Purchase Agreement at its November 24, 2020, public meeting.
17 Petitioner is informed and believes, and based thereon alleges, that PWD did not file any Notice of
18 Exemption under CEQA for the Purchase Agreement. Greenhouse is informed and believes, and based
19 thereon alleges, that PWD, ESCC, and SLCC subsequently executed the Purchase Agreement in late
20 January/early February 2021.

21 19. Even though the Purchase Agreement was already executed, SWD scheduled a board
22 | meeting for February 9, 2021, at which it contemplated the consideration of two items: (i) a transfer of
23 5,000 AF of water to SLCC to effectuate the Purchase Agreement, and (ii) a 10-Year Transfer Program
24 | under which SWD and ESCC seek to transfer up to 5,000 AF per year to facilitate further transfers to
25 PWD for the next decade.

26 20. Because the agenda for the February 9, 2021, meeting did not specify the time of the
27' meeting, SWD was required to cancel the meeting.
28 ///

(77392/002/01207739.DOCX)
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

21. On March 9, 2021, SWD conducted a rescheduled meeting at which it considered: (i):
2. transfer of 5,000 AF of water to SLCC to effectuate the Purchase Agreement, and (ii) a 10-Year Transfer

3 Program under which SWD and BSCC seek to transfer up to 5,000 AF per year to facilitate further

•
4 transfers to PWD for the next decade.

22. At the March 9, 2021, meeting, the board approved the 10-Year Transfer Program. Stäff,
6• however, announced the one-time transfer was removed from the agenda. Staff did not state whether it

7 Was abandoning the one-time transfer or deferring action on the transfer to a later date.

8 23. On March 17, 2021, SWD filed a Notice of Exemption for the 10-Year Transfer Program.
?'! 9 24. Because the 10-Year Transfer Program and the transfer of water pursuant to the Purchase
10 Agreement both seek to effectuate the same end-i.e., the transfer of 5,000 per year to PWD-they are

11 each part of the "Project" as a "whole" under CEQA.

12 The Proiect Is Cognizable Under CEQA.

13 25. CEQA only applies to "discretionary projects proposed to be carried out or approved by
14 public agencies." (Public Resources Code § 21080, subd. (a).)

15 26. Public Resources Code Section 21065 defines a "project" as an "activity which may
161 cause either direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect change in
17 the environment, and which is any of the following: an activity directly undertaken by any public
18| agency; an activity undertaken by a person which is supported, in whole or in part, through contracts,
19 grants, subsidies, loans, or other forms of assistance from one or more public agencies; or an activity

20 that involves the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or other entitlement for use

21 by one or more public agencies."

22 27. The approval of the Project is "discretionary" act because SWD and PWD used their
23 subjective judgment and deliberation when deciding whether to approve the Purchase Agreement and
24 the 10-Year Transfer Program pursuant to their general powers under the California Water Code.

25 28. The Project is a "project" under CEQA because it is an "activity [which] may cause
26t either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect change in the
27, environment." The Project is "an activity undertaken by a person which is supported, in whole or in
28 ///

I. 47739/002/01207739.DOCX} 6

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

part, through contracts, grants, subsidies, loans, or other forms of assistance from one or more public

0 agencies."

29. Moreover, the water transfers contemplated under the Project will also cause "either a
4 direct physical change in the "environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect change in the

5 environment" for the following reasons:

6 a. The Merced Subbasin is a critically overdrafted basin. (See Merced

7 Groundwater Subbasin Groundwater Sustainability Plan, 1 at ES-1.) The

8 average groundwater level decline in the subbasin was 1.2 to 2.4 feet/year.
(Id. at 2-61.) Groundwater storage within the subbasin has declined at a

10 rate of 192,000 acre-feet per year. (Id. at 2-78.) And the groundwater
11 underlying the subbasin has exceedingly high levels of TDS (Total

12 Dissolved Solids), Chloride (CI), Arsenic (As), Iron (Fe), and Manganese
13 (Mn), all of which are exacerbated by groundwater depletion. (Id. at 2-89,
14 2-90, 2-92, 2-94, 2-95, 2-96.) Despite these recognized conditions,

15 Respondents and Parties in Interest, through the Project, seek to convey

16 water out of the subbasin in the amount of up to 5,000 acre-feet per year.
17 Because groundwater storage is actively declining, and the Project will

18 reduce the amount of surface water within the subbasin to displace
19 groundwater overdraft, there is at least a possibility the Project will impede

20 sustainable groundwater management of the Subbasin, and result in

21 degraded water quality levels. (See CEQA Guidelines, Appx. G, subds.

22 X(a), X(b), X(e).)

23 b. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that Respondents

24. and Real Parties in Interest intend to electrify the pumps necessary to use
25 the siphons under the Eastside Bypass to accommodate large transfers of

26 water. These siphon are located on or around the Property. These large

27 pumps will generate significant noise and decrease the viability of the

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- -
2 Property as habitat for waterfowl and other species. (See CEQA Guidelines,
Appx. G, subd. XIII(a).)
mg 7 0 0 C. Water conveyance down the East Side Canal has previously resulted in
levees onto Greenhouse Ranch's property being washed out. (See Exhibit
"C.") As a result of these incidences, Petitioner has been required to make

7 significant repairs to the levee. Mitigation should be required to ensure that

8 such direct physical changes to the subject property will not occur in the

.. c future. Absent such mitigation, the Project will result in impacts to Geology

10 and Soils, and specifically landslides, soil erosion, and levee breaches. (See

11 CEQA Guidelines, Appx. G, subds. VII(a)(iv), VII(b), VII(c).)

d.

12 The Eastside Bypass traverses through the San Luis National Wildlife

13 Refuge and the Grasslands Wildlife Management Area, both of which

14 include refuges owned by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and properties

15 maintained through USFWS easements. The refuge hosts numerous

16 endangered species, including the California tiger salamander, the long-

17 horned fairy shrimp, and the San Joaquin kit fox. The Project will result in

18 changes to water flows, including increased flows within the East Side

19 Canal, altering the habitat for such species. Despite this, there is no analysis

20 of the impacts of the Water Transfers on biological resources. (See CEQA
Guidelines, Appx. G, subd. IV.)

21 e..

22 The water conveyance will increase the usage of the East Side Bypass and

23 thus degrade the use of the Property as a recreation area. (CEQA
Guidelines, Appx. G, subd. XVI.)

24 f.

25 In addition, because the transfer will likely be effectuated through the

26 Eastside Canal, i.e. the Easement, the exception in CEQA Guideline section

27 15300.2(a) applies. This facility traverses several environmentally sensitive

28 lands, including the San Luis National Wildlife Refuge and the Grasslands
Wildlife Management Area, both of which host endangered species like the

2 Joaquin kit fox.

3 PWD and SWD Was Required to Perform Environmental Review for the Proiect.

4 30. PWD and SWD were required to, at a minimum, perform an Initial Study to determine if
S the Project may have a significant effect on the environment. Neither PWD nor SWD performed an

6 initial study nor determined that an EIR would be necessary in lieu of an initial study.
31. After an initial study is performed, the lead agency (in this case either PWD or SWD)
8 must determine whether an EIR or negative declaration is appropriate. Here, neither PWD nor SWD
: r 9 prepared an initial study, a negative declaration, or an environmental impact report under CEQA.
10 *The Profect t Ckemptfrom CEOA Review

11 32. The Project is clearly discretionary because the Project required the subjective judgment
12 and deliberation of PWD and SWD.

13 33. PWD asserted no applicable exemptions to CEQA for the Project.
14 34. SWD, in contrast, asserted three grounds for exemption, none of which are applicable
15 here:

16 a. Class 1 Exemption for Existing Facilities (CEOA Guidelines, $ 15301):
17 This exemption applies to the repair or alteration of structures, facilities,
18 equipment, or topographical features. The Project, however, does not

19 contemplate the repair or alteration of any facilities. Rather, it contemplates
20 the transfer of water. The exemption is inapplicable.

21 be Clast 4 Exemption for Minot Alterations to Lant  CEOA Gutdelines

22 § 15304): This exemption applies to "minor public or private alterations in

23 the condition of land, water, and/or vegetation which do not involve

24 removal of healthy, mature, scenic trees except for forestry and agricultural

25 purposes." As shown in the exemptions provided in the CEQA Guidelines,

26 an "alteration" of land or water is something akin to grading, a temporary
27 land use, or minor trenching. It is inapplicable to a water transfer from one a

28 location to another.

3 Exempttons to Exemptions: neither of the above exemptions can be relied
upon because "there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a

4 significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances," as

5 explained above.

d.

6 Common Sense Exemption; SWD also relied upon the "common sense"

7 exemption, which is only applicable where "it can be seen with certainty

8

1% that there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant

9 effect on the environment." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15061(b)(3).) Here, is

10 catnot be seen with certainty that there is no possibility the Project would

11 not have an environmental impact.

12 CAUSES OF ACTION

13 First Cause of Action - Failure to Perform Environmental Review Under CEQA

35. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs: through
14 34 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

15 36. CEQA was enacted to require public agencies and decision-makers to document and
16 consider the environmental implications of their actions before formal decisions are made, (Pub.!
17 Resources Code, § 21002), and to "[e]nsure that the long-term protection of the environment shall bei

18

19

20 the guiding criterion in public decisions." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21001, subd. (d).) "CEQA was
intended to be interpreted in such a manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment
within the reasonable scope of statutory authority." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15003, subd. (f).) The
21| overriding purpose of CEQA is to ensure agencies regulating activities that may affect the environment.
22 give primary consideration to preventing environmental damage. CEQA is the Legislature's declaration
23, of policy that all necessary action be taken to protect, rehabilitate and enhance the environmental quality*
24I of the state. (Save Our Peninsula v. Monterey County Board of Supers. (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 99, 177
25 [citing Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n v. Regents of Univ. of Calif. (1988) 47 Cal.3d 373, 392].)
26 37. Where the CEQA environmental process was procedurally or substantively defective,
27 reviewing courts may find prejudicial abuse of discretion even if proper adherence to CEQA mandates
28 may not have resulted in a different outcome. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21005, subd. (a).) For example,

I. 17739/002/01207739.DOCX} 10

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

the Court in Citizens to Preserve the Ojai v. County of Ventura (1985) 176 Cal.App.3d 421, 428, held
that the certification of an EIR that had not adequately discussed the environmental impacts of thel
project constituted : prejudicial abuse of discretion even if strict compliance with the mandates of CEQA
would not have altered the outcome. The Court in Resource Defense Fund v. LAFCo (1987) 191
Cal.App.3d 886, 897-98 [disapproved on other grounds, Voice of the Wetlands v. State Water Resources,

6 Control Bd. (2011) 52 Cal 4th 499, 528-29], went so far as to declare that failure to comply with CEQA
7 procedural requirements was per se prejudicial. The court in Kings County Farm Bureau V. City of
Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 712, in turn, explained that an agency commits prejudicial error if

9 "the failure to include relevant information precludes informed decision making and informed public
10 participation, thereby thwarting the statutory goals of the EIR process."

11 38. Respondents both performed discretionary actions in approving the activities comprising|
12. the Project, and there were no applicable oxemptions from environmental review under CEQA.
13 Respondents were required to comply with the law by performing environmental review of the Project]
14 under CEQA. Contrary to the law, Respondents did not do so.

15 39. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21080.5, Petitioner is entitled to petition this
a 16 Court for a writ of mandate requiring Respondents to comply with CEQA.

17 40. Petitioner has a clear, present, and beneficial right to performance by Respondents of
18 their duties under CEQA, and Respondents have the duty and capacity to perform their duties under
19 CEQA.

20 41. Petitioner also has a clear, present, and beneficial interest in the issuance of a mandate

21 by virtue of the facts set forth in this Petition, in that they are and will continue to be adversely affected
22 by Respondents' continuing violations of CEQA. The failure of Respondents to perform their duties
23 requires this Court a to issue a writ of mandate directing them to discharge their duties under Code of
24 Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21080.5, 21168, and

25: 21168.5.

26 Second Cause of Action - Fair Argument of Significant Impacts in Violation of CEQA

27 42, Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs 1 through
28 41 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

1/ 2739/002/01207739.DOCX} 11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

43. CEQA was adopted by the California Legislature to prevent environmental harm while
2 providing a decent home and satisfying living for every Californian. The policies and legislative intent
3 behind CEQA are intended to be an integral party of any public agency's decision-making process.

":
4 CEQA applies to discretionary projects approved by public agencies.

44, PWD and SWD were eligible to be a "lead agency" responsible for evaluating the

6 Project's environmental impacts under CEQA. As a part of this duty, Respondents were required to
prepare an EIR when substantial evidence in the record supports "fair argument" that the Project may

8 a have a significant impact on the environment.

9 45. CEQA also required Respondents to adopt feasible mitigation measures to reduce or

10 avoid any significant environmental impacts. If substantial evidence in the record supports a "fair

11 argument" that a project's significant environmental impacts could not be mitigated to a less than

12 significant level, Respondents are likewise required to prepare a full environmental impact report instead

13 of a mitigated negative declaration.

46.
14 Respondents' approval of the Project constitutes a discretionary act that triggers its

15 obligation to comply with CEQA.
47. Respondents violated CEQA by approving the Project because, based on the record, 16 Respondents failed to adequately evaluate and mitigate the Project impacts that may be significant,
17 including, but not limited to:
18
a, Noise. Substantial evidence of a fair argument exists that the Project would
19 result in significant impacts to wildlife, and the increased noise would result 3

20 in a degradation of the use of the surrounding property for wildlife habitat.
21 Without a noise analysis to determine the extent of the potential impacts on
22 wildlife, the failure to review the Project is in violation of CEQA.
'23 b. Biological Resources. Substantial evidence of a fair argument exists that
24 the Project would result in degradation of the use of the surrounding
25 property as wildlife habitat. Further, the Eastside Bypass passes through
26 the San Luis National Wildlife Refuge and the Grasslands Wildlife

27 Management Area, which are home to numerous endangered species,

28 including the California Tiger Salamander, the long-horned fairy shrimp,

|l 37739/002/01207739.DOCX M-. 12
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

and the San Joaquin kit fox. There is a fair argument that the water transfers
2 will alter critical habitat for these species, and a as such a biological study
w and further analysis of these potential impacts must be conducted.

4 C. Geology and Soils. Water conveyances have previously resulted in damage

5 to levees on the adjacent properties, causing significant damage.

6 Substantial evidence of a fair argument exists that increased conveyances

7 down the East Side Canal will cause landslides, erosion, and further levee

8 breaches. Mitigation will likely be required in order to prevent impacts to

* 9 the geology and soils of the area along the East Side Canal, and a failure to

10 analyze these potential impacts is in violation of CEQA.
d. 11 Hydrology/Water Quality. The Merced subbasin is a critically overdrafted a

12 basin, and the groundwater within the subbasin has exceedingly high levels

13 of TDS (Total Dissolved Solids), Chloride (C1), Arsenic (As), Iron (Fe), and

14 Manganese (Mn), all of which are exacerbated by groundwater depletion.

15 The water transfers seek to transfer water out of the subbasin, which would

16 directly impact groundwater recharge. There is, thus, evidence of a fair
argument that the Project will result in significant impacts to the
17 groundwater quality, which already suffers from cyclical drought and
18
19 historical mismanagement. A failure to analyze these impacts is in violation
of CEQA.
20 48. Respondents violated CEQA by failing to prepare an EIR for the Project when the recordi
21 demonstrates that the Project may cause the potentially significant environmental impacts described
•22 above, among others, which have not been adequately disclosed, analyzed, or mitigated to a less than;
23 significant level.
24 49. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion, and failed to proceed in a manner
:25 required by law, by failing to conduct any environmental analysis whatsoever despite the presence of a
26 fair argument that the Project would have significant environmental effects. Thus, Respondents abused
27 their discretion by failing to prepare an environmental impact report to address the significant
28 environmental impacts.

{7739/002/01207739.DOCX}.. . 13
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

50. Petitioner has a clear, present and beneficial right to performance by Respondents of their
2 duties under CEQA, and Respondents have the duty and capacity to perform their duties under CEQA
as the lead agency of the Project.

4 Petitioner also has a clear, present, and beneficial interest in the
issuance of a writ of mandate as they are and will be adversely affected by Respondents' violations of
CEQA. The failure of Respondents to perform their duties under the law requires this Court to issue a
writ of mandate directing them to discharge their duties under CEQA, pursuant to Sections 21080 and
21080.5 of the Public Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
Third Cause of Action - Piecemeal/Segmentation of Environmental Review

51. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs 1 through?
10 50 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

11 52. The "requirements of CEQA cannot be avoided by piecemeal review which results from
12 chopping a large project into many little ones-each with a minimal potential impact on the
13 environment--which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences." (Envt'l Prot. Info. Ctr. v. Calif.
14 Dept. of Forestry & Fire Prot. (2008) 44 Cal.4th 459, 503.) Thus, CEQA "forbids 'piecemeal' review

15 of the significant environmental impacts of a project." (Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay Comm. v. Bd.
16| of Port Comm'rs (2011) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1358.) Rather, when a lead agency undertakes the
17! environmental review process, the lead agency must review and consider the "whole of the action,"

18 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15378 [emphasis added]), and consider "the effects, both individual and collective, cite

19 of all activities involved in [the] project." (Pub. Resources § Code, § 21002.1, subd. (d).) It is only

20 through a complete and accurate "view of the project may affected outsiders and public decision-makers
21 balance the proposal's benefit against its environmental cost." (Berkeley Keep Jets, supra, 91
22 Cal.App.4th at 1358.) This allows affected outsiders and public decision-makers to "consider mitigation
23 measures, assess the advantage of terminating the proposal
24: Fbalance." (Id. at 1358.) and weigh other alternatives in the

25 53. In this case, neither PWD nor SWD considered the "whole of the action." When the
26 Project was considered by the PWD Board, it only the Purchase Agreement. The agenda did not mention
27i, the Project's duration, cost, or impact. SWD, in turn, did not consider the Purchase Agreement or the

28 ///

11.17739/002/01207739.DOCX 14
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

I one-time transfer, but instead approved a 10-Year Transfer Program to effectuate water transfers for the

2 next ten years.

3 54. Full environmental review and consideration of the Project was required before
*
4 Respondents could approve the Project.

5 55. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by taking the above-described actions
6 in violation of CEQA. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and Respondents'

7 decisions were not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Respondents further violated CEQA
8 by failing to independently review and analyze the effects of their actions prior to approving the Project
. 9 and entering into the Purchase Agreement. Petitioner is entitled to petition this Court for a writ of
10 mandate requiring Respondents to comply with CEQA under Public Resources Code Sections 21080.5,|
11 21168, and 21168.5.

12 56. Petitioner has a clear, present, and beneficial right to performance by Respondents of
13 their duties under CEQA, and Respondents have the duty and capacity to perform their duties under
14 CEQA and the Board's implementing regulations.

15 57. Petitioner also has a clear, present, and beneficial interest in the issuance of a mandate
16 by virtue of the facts set forth in this Petition, in that they, are and will continue to be adversely affected

17 by Respondents' continuing violations of CEQA. The failure of Respondents to perform their duties
18 requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate directing them to discharge their duties under Code of

19 Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21080.5, 21168, and
20 21168.5.

21 Fourth Cause of Action - Declaratory Relief

22 58. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs 1 through
23 57 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

24 59. With respect to the violations of law alleged above, there exists a clear and actuall
25 controversy between Petitioner and Respondents regarding Respondents' failures to comply with
26 CEQA. Petitioner contends that Respondents have not complied with CEQA, while Respondents

27 contend that they have done so, or are not required to. This controversy between the Parties not only

28 creates substantial danger that Petitioner's property rights will damaged, but also that CEQA will be

| (7739/002/0(207739.DOCX} 15
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE & COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY & INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 ignored. As such, a judicial determination as to the Parties' rights and obligations under CEQA is

2 necessary. .wte

3 60.

4 This declaration is further required under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1060 and
1094.5 and under Government Code section 11350, to prevent violation of the Government Code, which
5 requires that all valid regulations shall be made "in accordance with standards prescribed by other'
6 provisions of law," including CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.

7 61.

8 62. There is no other adequate legal remedy available to resolve this controversy.
To remedy these violations of law, Petitioner requests a declaration of the duties of
9 |Respondents under CEQA and the CEQA guidelines, a declaration that Respondents have not complied
10 with CEQA, and a declaration invalidating the Purchase Agreement,

11

12 Fifth Cause of Action - Injunctive Relief

63. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs 1 through
•13 62 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

14 64. With respect to the violations of law alleged above, Respondents will continue to proceed
15 in a manner that will cause Petitioner harm, for which Petitioner cannot be fully compensated.

16 65. Petitioner is therefore entitled to a permanent injunction pursuant to Code of Civil
17 Procedure sections 525-526 commanding Respondents to cease violating CEQA as detailed above, and
18 to follow the required legal processes for evaluating the environmental impacts of the Regulation.

19 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

20 1.

21 For a peremptory writ of mandate under CEQA, as specified in Petitioner's First through,
Third Causes of Action;

22 2. For declaratory relief under CEQA and the Code of Civil Procedure with respect to the
23 violations of law alleged in Petitioner's First through Third Causes of Action, as specified in the Fourth
24|. Cause of Action;

25 3. For an injunction restraining the violations of law alleged in Petitioner's First through
