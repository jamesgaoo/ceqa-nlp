VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner LINDA KROFF ("Petitioner") hereby challenges the approval by

3 Respondent CITY OF LOS ANGELES ("City") of an exemption from the California

4 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), adopted in connection with the demotion of two auto

5 repair buildings totaling 2,160 square feet, and the construction, use and maintenance of a five-

6 story, 13,882 square foot, 16-unit residential building measuring 59 feet, 4 inches in height at

7 4575 W. Santa Monica Boulevard/1102-1112 N. Lyman Place ("Project").

8 2. The City's reliance on a Categorical Exemption pursuant to CEQA Guidelines,

9 Section 15332 (In-Fill Development Project) Class 32 ("Class 32 Categorical Exemption") is in

10 error, as set forth herein. The Court must set the Project aside and require environmental review

11 in conformance with CEQA,

12 JURISDICTION

13 3. This Court has jurisdiction over the instant action under §§1085 and 1094.5 of the

14 Code of Civil Procedure, and §§21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

15 PARTIES

16 4. Petitioner is an individual who owns and operates the real property located at 4565

17 W. Santa Monica Boulevard which is improved with a photography studio and located

18 immediately adjacent to the proposed Project. Petitioner has a substantial interest in ensuring that

19 the City's decisions are in conformity with the requirements of law, including CEQA, and in

20 having those requirements properly executed and the public duties of the City enforced. Petitioner

21 will be adversely affected by impacts resulting from the City's actions, approvals and inactions

22 as described herein, and is aggrieved by the acts, decisions and omissions of the City, as alleged

23 In this Petition.

24 5. Respondent City is a municipal corporation, organized and existing under the laws

25 of the state of California, located within the County of Los Angeles. The City has the duty and
26 responsibility to proceed in accordance with law and ensure that all discretionary approvals

27 comply with all applicable laws, including CEQA. Public Resources Code §21000 et. seq.; and

28 14 Cal. Code Regs. §15000 et. seq.

-2-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 6. Petitioner is informed, believes and thereon alleges that Real Party in Interest 4575

2 SANTA MONICA BLVD., LLC ("Real Party") is a duly organized and existing California

3 limited liability company; the owner of the real property upon which the Project is proposed; an

4 "Applicant" as listed in filings for the Project approvals described herein; a proposed developer

5 of the Project; and an entity to whom the City purported to grant Project approvals. As such, Real

6 Party is an entity whose interest is directly affected by the proceeding and is named as a Real

7 Party in Interest.

8 7. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of other Respondents or

9 other Real Parties in Interest sued herein as DOES 1-25, inclusive, and ROES 1-25, inclusive,

10 and, therefore, sues these individuals and/or entities by such fictitious names. Petitioner will

11 amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of fictitiously named parties when

12 ascertained. Petitioner is informed, believes and thereon alleges that each party designated herein

13 as a DOE and/or a ROE is responsible for the events and happenings alleged in this Petition or

14 has a beneficial interest in the discretionary actions challenged herein.

15 8. Petitioner is informed, believes and thereon alleges that at all times herein

16 mentioned, Respondents or other Real Parties in Interest, and each of them, were the agents,

17 servants, employees, partners, and alter egos of the remaining Respondents or other Real Parties

18 in Interest, that the acts complained of herein were done within the course and scope of said

19 agency, service, employment, and partnership, and that the acts by each Respondent or other Real

20 Party in Interest were ratified, approved and adopted by each of the remaining Respondents or

21 Real Parties in Interest. Wherever the terms "Respondents," or "Real Parties in Interest" is used
22 herein, it shall mean "Respondents and/or other Real Parties in Interest, and each of them."

23 STATEMENT OF FACTS

24 9. On or about January 19, 2018, Real Parties filed an application, with the City's

25 Department of City Planning ("City Planning"), for Project entitlements which included Transit

26 Oriented Communities Affordable Housing incentives; Project Permit Compliance Review with

27 the Vermont/Western Station Neighborhood Area Plan (SNAP"); and a Project Permit

28 Adjustment from the SNAP (collectively, "Project Entitlements").

-3-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 10. On or about June 4, 2019, City Planning approved the Project Entitlements. In

2 connection therewith, the Director of Planning determined that based on the whole of the
administrative record the Project is exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines, Section

4 15332 (In-Fill Development Project) Class 32, and there is no substantial evidence demonstrating

5 that any exceptions contained in Section 15300.2 of the State CEQA Guidelines regarding

6 location, cumulative impacts, significant effects or unusual circumstances, scenic highways, or
hazardous waste sites, or historical resources applies.

8 11. On or about June 18, 2019, Petitioner timely filed an appeal of City Planning's
9 determination to the City Planning Commission ("CPC"). Petitioner's appeal contended, in

10 relevant part, that the Class 32 Categorical Exemption adopted for the Project was inadequate

11 under CEQA.

12 12. On or about October 24, 2019, the CPC met at a regularly scheduled hearing and

13 considered Petitioner's appeal. Petitioner and Petitioner's counsel appeared and testified against

14 the Project, and its non-conformity with CEQA. After taking testimony and closing the public

15 hearing, the CPC denied Petitioner's appeal.

16 13. On or about November 7, 2019, the CPC issued a Letter of Determination

17 regarding its October 24, 2019 actions.

18 14. On or about December 11, 2019, Petitioner timely filed an appeal of the Class 32

19 Categorical Exemption adopted in connection with the Project to the City Council. Petitioner's

20 appeal contended that the Class 32 Categorical Exemption was inadequate under CFQA.

21 15. On or about February 4, 2020, the Planning and Land Use Management|

22 Committee (hereinafter referred to as the "PLUM Committee"), a standing committee of the City

23 Council, met at a regularly scheduled hearing and considered Petitioner's appeal. Again,

24 Petitioner, through counsel, appeared and testified against the Project, its many adverse impacts

25 and the inadequacy of the Categorical Exemption.

26 16. After taking testimony and closing the public hearing, the PLUM Committee made

27 recommendations that the full City Council deny Petitioner's appeal, adopt the findings of the

28 CPC, and find that that based on the whole of the administrative record, the Project is exempt

-4-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines, Section 15332 (In-Fill Development Project) Class

2 32, and there is no substantial evidence demonstrating that any exceptions contained in Section

3 15300.2 of the State CEQA Guidelines regarding location, cumulative impacts, significant effects

4 or unusual circumstances, scenic highways, or hazardous waste sites, or historical resources

5 applies.

6 17. On or about February 18, 2020, the matter came to the City Council as a whole.

7 The City Council adopted the PLUM Committee's report and recommendations.

8 18. As set forth above, Petitioner objected to the Project, and its environmental

9 clearance under CEQA, during the administrative process, including submitting letters, filing

10 appeals and testifying during public hearings, exhausting her administrative remedies.

11 19. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

12 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate and injunctive relief.

13 20. Petitioner is informed, believes and thereon alleges that unless the City and Real

14 Parties are restrained and enjoined from the issuance of grading and building permits as well as

15 any construction of the Project before the Court's determination on the merits in this action,

16 Petitioner and the general public will suffer great and irreparable harm.

17 21. Without injunctive relief, Petitioner and the public would be denied their rightful

18 remedies if the Project was allowed to proceed with development and thereafter the Court

19 determines that the Categorical Exemption and Project approvals must be set aside on any of the

20 grounds asserted herein.

21 22. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code §21167.5 by providing the

22 City with notice of intention to commence the within action. [Exhibit A].

23 23. Pursuant to Public Resources Code §21167.6(b)(2), Petitioner elects to prepare the

24 administrative record. A copy of Petitioner's Notice to Prepare the Administrative Record is

25 attached hereto as Exhibit B.

26 24. CEQA, enacted in California Public Resources Code $821000-21177, was enacted

27 to ensure that the long-term protection of the environment, consistent with the provision of a

28 ///

-5-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 decent home and suitable living environment for every Californian, shall be the guiding criterion

2 in public decisions.

3 25. CEQ requires that prior to approval of any discretionary project, the environmental

4 effects of that project be evaluated on the existing environment.

5 26. CEQA requires strict compliance with the procedures and mandates of the statute.

6 27. CEQA is not merely a procedural statute. It imposes clear and substantive

7 responsibilities on agencies that propose to approve projects, requiring such agencies to not

8 approve projects that harm the environment unless and until all feasible mitigation measures are

9 employed to minimize that harm.

10 28. Failure to comply with the substantive requirements of CEQA or to carry out the

11 full CEQA procedures so that complete. information of a project's impacts is developed and

12 publicly disclosed constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion that requires invalidation of the

13 public agency action regardless of whether full compliance would have produced a different

14 result.

15 29. The City erred and abused its discretion in adopting the Class 32 Categorical

16 Exemption for the Project because Class 32 Categorical Exemptions may only be adopted for

17 projects consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan

18 policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations.

19 30. In the City of Los Angeles, the City's General Plan Land Use Element is made up

20 of 35 Community Plans. In certain areas of the City, the Community Plans are further subject to

21 Plan Overlays, such as Specific Plans. Here, the Project Site is overlaid by the SNAP.

22 31. This Project, by definition, does not comply with SNAP. Indeed, it specifically
23 includes deviations from SNAP. It also does not comply with applicable zoning regulations by

24 including reductions from otherwise required open space requirements. Therefore, a Class 32

25 Categorical Exemption is, on its face, not applicable.

26 32. Furthermore, under the CEQA Guidelines, Class 32 Exemptions may only be

27 adopted for projects which would not result in any significant impacts relating to traffic, noise,

28 ///

-6-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 air quality, or water quality and on sites that can be adequately served by all required utilities and
2 public services.

3 33. The City's findings that the within challenged Project would not result in any

4 significant impacts relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality and can be adequately

5 served by all required utilities and public services is not supported by substantial evidence.

6 Indeed, there record contains substantial evidence to the contrary.

7 34. Application of the Class 32 Categorical Exemption is also inapplicable when the

8 cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time, is

9 significant.

10 35. Here, there is no evidence to support the conclusion that the "cumulative impact"

11 of the Project will not result in any potentially significant impacts. There are no other "reasonably.

12 foreseeable probably future projects" listed or analyzed. To the contrary, there is evidence that

13 the Project requires a cumulative impact analysis and poses cumulative impacts.

14 36. CEQA also prohibits use of a categorical exemption when "there is a reasonable
15 possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual

16 circumstances."

17 37. Here, the record contains substantial evidence that the Project is located on a site

18 where expansive clay soils are present and, as a result of such geologic site conditions, will impact

19 nearby structures, warranting documentation and remediation of adjacent property conditions as

20 well as vibration and noise monitoring. Furthermore, due to the unique nature of Petitioner's

21 photography studio, and its proximity/location in connection with the Project, the Project will

22 cause significant shade/shadow impacts.

23 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment against Respondents and Real Parties, and

24 each of them, as follows:

25 1. That this Court issue an alternative and peremptory writ of mandate directing the

26 City and its departments to set aside and vacate the adopted Categorical Exemption for the

27 Project;

28 ///

3 inadequate Categorical Exemption;

4 3. a For a temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent injunctions

5 enjoining further construction and completion of the Project until this action can be decided on

6 the merits;

4. For costs of suit and attorneys' fees according to law, including Code of Civil
Procedure §1021.5; and
5. For such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and appropriate.
