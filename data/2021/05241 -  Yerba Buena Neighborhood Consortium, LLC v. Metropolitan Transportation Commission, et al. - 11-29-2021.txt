Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 Petitioner Yerba Buena Neighborhood Consortium, LLC, alleges:

2 1. This public-interest action seeks to enforce mandates of the California

3 Environmental Quality Act vis-Ã -vis "Plan Bay Area 2050." PBA2050 proposes to serve 4

5 as the Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) and Sustainable Communities Strategy

6 (SCS) for a 7,000 square-mile, 9-county region: Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa,

7 San Francisco, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma Counties.
8

9 Despite lofty stated goals, PBA2050 as analyzed in the program EIR and approved by

10 the Metropolitan Transportation Commission and Association of Bay Area

11 Governments could propel the disappearance of lower-income/working class/minority
12 BIPOC Central City communities and the market-driven displacement of hundreds of
13

14 thousands of long-time residents. Many would be forced out of the Bay Area entirely.

15 The PBA 2050 EIR process fails to adequately analyze and mitigate significant

16 environmental impacts or to analyze an adequate range of potentially-feasible
17

18 alternatives, including the "Equity, Environment, and Jobs Alternative" of PBA2040.

19 A peremptory writ of mandamus should issue in the public interest.

20 Jurisdiction

21
2.
22 This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code section 21168

23 et seq. and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 et seq. because the parties are located

24 in the City and County of San Francisco.
25
Parties
26
3.
27 Petitioner Yerba Buena Consortium is a California LLC that is a subsidiary

28 of the California non-profit corporation Tenants and Owners Development Corporation

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 2

1 (TODCO), founded for community-based affordable housing and neighborhood

2 advocacy after approval of the Yerba Buena Center Redevelopment Project in the 1970s.
3
Since 1980 TODCO has successfully provided low-income housing and resident services
4

5 to this community, and its Consortium continues to advocate for pedestrian safety,
6 community services, and community-building programs in the city's South of Market

7 neighborhood as well as for citywide issues, including both the Proposition C Child
8

9 Education ballot measure and the Proposition C Homeless Assistance ballot measure in

10 2018. TODCO continues to renovate, improve, and manage almost 1000 units of

11 affordable housing and to maximize the quality of life of neighborhood residents
12 through community planning and advocacy undertaken by its Consortium. The
13

14 Consortium brings this petition on behalf of others similarly situated too numerous to

15 be brought before this Court as petitioners. The Consortium exhausted administrative

16 remedies by commenting on the PBA2050 EIR and objecting to its approval.
17
4.
18 Respondent Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) is the
19 transportation planning, coordinating, and financing agency for the nine-county San

20 Francisco Bay Area region (Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San
21 Mateo, Santa Clara, Solano, and Sonoma Counties). MTC functions under state and
22

23 federal law as the transportation planning, coordinating, and financing agency for the

24 nine-county Bay Area, and is responsible for preparing and updating the Regional
25 Transportation Plan (RTP) every four years.
26
5. Respondent Association of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) ABAG was
27

28 formed in 1961 by a joint powers agreement among Bay Area local governments and

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 3

1 serves as the comprehensive regional planning agency and Council of Governments for

2 the nine counties and 101 cities and towns of the San Francisco Bay region. It is a public
3

4 entity created by local governments to meet planning and research needs related to land

5 use and is responsible under state law for conducting the Regional Housing Needs

6 Allocation process. ABAG is responsible for preparing and updating the Sustainable
Communities Strategy (SCS) every 4 years.

6.
9 The MTC and ABAG acted as joint lead agencies responsible for CEQA

10 compliance and certification of the PBA2050 EIR. The MTC approved the RTP and

11 ABAG approved the SCS with CEQA findings based on the PBA2050 EIR process.
12
7.
13 Does 1 to 10 are fictitiously named respondents whose true names and

14 capacities are currently unknown to petitioners. If and when their true names and

15 capacities are known, the Consortium will amend this petition to assert them.

16

17 General Allegations

18 8. The paragraphs below refer to and rely on information in documents
19

20 relating to this action, all of which will be filed with this Court as part of the record of
21 I proceedings and are here incorporated by reference.

22 Project Description and Environmental Setting
23
9.
24 As described in the PBA2050 Draft Program EIR, the San Francisco Bay

25 Area region includes nine counties in four subareas containing 101 cities: North Bay

26 (Marin, Napa, Solano, and Sonoma Counties); East Bay (Alameda and Contra Costa

27 Counties); South Bay (Santa Clara County); and West Bay (San Francisco and San
28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 4

Mateo Counties). The total area is approximately 4.4 million acres (7,000 square

2 miles). Its population is estimated at almost 8 million, 20 percent of California's total.

10. PBA2050 is proposed as the third RTP/SCS for the Bay Area, updating
Plan Bay Area 2040 and Regional Housing Needs Allocation cycle. It is intended as a

6 blueprint for housing, economy, transportation, and the environment, accommodating

7 future Bay Area growth while achieving regional GHG emissions reduction targets
8

9 established by the California Air Resources Board pursuant to Senate Bill 375.

10 Environmental Review Process and Project Approval

11 11. MTC/ABAG staff prepared the EIR for PBA2050, beginning in September

12 2020 with issuance of the Notice of Preparation. Staff released the Draft EIR in early
13

14 June 2021 and public comment was received in June and July. There were three virtual

15 public hearings. About one hundred and fifty comment letters and responses on the

16 Draft EIR were published in the Final EIR. Concerns received on the project and EIR
17

18 included those from housing and equity advocates and local jurisdictions regarding the

19 need to prioritize support of anti-displacement efforts.

20 12. In September 2021, the MTC Planning Committee and ABAG

21 Administrative Committee met to review the PBA2050 EIR and considered revisions to
22

23 the Final EIR in response to comments.

24 13. Significant amendments were made to the Draft EIR in a Final EIR in

25 response to comments in the first week of October 2021, as listed in the CEQA Findings
26

27 adopted on October 21, 2021, but the EIR was not recirculated for further comment.

28 Despite amendments and mitigation measures, MTC and ABAG conceded in eighty

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 5

1 pages of findings that PBA 2050 would result in significant adverse environmental

2 impacts to, inter alia, scenic vistas; state scenic highways; air quality due to substantial
3

4 net increase in construction-related emissions; expose sensitive receptors to substantiall

5 pollutant concentrations; species identified as candidate, sensitive, or special status;

6 designated critical habitat for federally listed plant and wildlife species; substantial

7 interference with the movement of any native resident or migratory fish or wildlife
8

9 species or with established native resident or migratory wildlife corridor, or impede the

10 use of native wildlife nursery sites; substantially effect riparian habitat or state or

11 federally protected wetlands; significance of historical resources; substantial adverse

12 change in the significance of unique archaeological resources; net increase in
13

14 greenhouse gas emissions that may have a significant impact on the environment;

15 conflict with an applicable state plan, policy or regulation adopted for the purpose of

16 reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases; zoning conflicts relating to public views;
17

18 conversion of prime farmland and timberland; air quality; transportation; insufficient

19 water supplies; insufficient wastewater facilities; relocation or construction of new or

20 expanded water, wastewater treatment or storm water drainage, electric power, natural
21 gas, or telecommunications facilities; substantial adverse physical impacts associated
22

23 with the need for new or physically altered governmental facilities, the construction of

24 which could cause significant environmental impacts, to maintain acceptable service

25 ratios, response times, or other performance objectivesfor fire protection, police
26

27 I protection, schools, parks, and other public facilities; groundborne vibration and noise

28 exceeding codified limits; impair emergency evacuation plan; impacts to hazardous

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 6

materials sites; directly or indirectly destroy a unique paleontological resource or site or

2 unique geologic feature; and substantial adverse changes in the significance of a unique

archaeological resource.

5 14. At a joint meeting on October 21, 2021 the Executive Boards of MTC and

6 ABAG certified the PBA2050 EIR with a Statement of Overriding Considerations that

7 the Plan's numerous significant environmenal impacts are outweighed by its benefits.
8

9 15. A Notice of Determination was filed and posted on October 22, 2021.

10 This action is timely filed on November 22, 2021, as the 30-day statute of limitations

11 ran on Sunday November 21, 2012 and November 22 is the next first court day.

12
16. The Consortium has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary
13

14 course of law. Issuance of a peremptory writ is needed to avoid immediate, severe, and

15 irreparable harm to the Consortium and Bay Area residents via approval and

16 implementation of the PBA2050 without compliance with state law. Respondents have
17

18 the capacity to correct their violations of law but refuse to do so.

19 17. The Consortium complied with Public Resources section 21167.5 by
20 providing the respondents with a copy of a notice of intention to commence this action.
21 The original notice and proof of service are concurrently filed with this petition. A copy
22

23 of this petition is being provided to the Attorney General.

24

25 Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act

26 18. The Consortium incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

27 19. The MTC and ABAG abused their discretion and failed to act in the manner
28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 required by law in certifying the EIR and relying upon its content to approve the

2 PBA2050 without adequate environmental review. The EIR's analysis was incomplete
and prejudiced project approval, failing to adequately respond to Draft EIR comments 4

5 and failing to serve as an adequate public disclosure document in its analysis of

6 significant environmental impacts and identification of mitigations and alternatives to

7 Plan-related and cumulative demand for public services such as police, fire, and
8

9 recreation, or to address Plan-specific and cumulative unstudied and unmitigated -

10 impacts. An adequate EIR should address, among other issues according to proof after

11 certification of the administrative record:

12 A detailed plan to fund the tens of thousands of housing units and temporary 13

14 facilities needed to end homelessness in the Bay Area within 10 years.

15 A 0% jobs/affordable housing balance for all large scale future commercial

16 development in all Bay Area counties. San Francisco's 2020 Proposition E was
17

18 the first step towards this goal in the region. It must be mandated throughout the

19 Bay Area, starting with the upcoming Oakland Downtown Plan, and expanded to

20 include the now booming development of biomed facilities region-wide too.
21

22 Exemption of all identified Central Cities "Communities of Concern" from the

23 designated Priority Development Areas and any state mandated up-zonings

24 unless and until affordable housing for ALL their lower-income and working

25 class residents is in place. PBA2050's mere promises of un-guaranteed and un-
26

27 required affordable housing for Communities of Concern without clear land use

28 policies that decommodify land and housing - instead relying on funding for the

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 8

1 affordable housing - are not realistic.

2 Transformation of the hundreds of wasted square miles of surface parking lots
3

4 for office parks and shopping malls throughout the region into medium-density

5 new residential districts to meet the Bay Area's market housing needs - without

6 disrupting the neighborhood life of existing communities.

7 A mandate for a minimum of 10% inclusionary housing now for middle-income
8

9 households everywhere in the Bay Area, gradually increasing to 24%, matching

10 San Francisco's approved 2028 legislative commitment, by 2050.

11 A mandate that no less than 50% of new housing developed on publicly-owned
12

13 property will be affordable for lower and middle-income households or teachers.

14 Analysis of foreseeable PBA 2050 impacts outside the studied nine Bay Area

15 counties due to displacement of lower-income populations in the current Priority

16 Equity Areas to areas to the east and south including Yolo, Stanislaus, and San
17

18 Joaquin Counties. The unadopted "Equity, Environment, and Jobs Alternative"

19 of PBA2040 should be considered as an alternative to reduce such displacement.

20 20. The MTC and ABAG findings certifying the EIR and approving the
21

22 PBA2050 are not supported by substantial evidence.

23 WHEREFORE, the Consortium prays:
24

25 1. That the Court issue a peremptory writ of mandamus ordering MTC and

26 ABAG to rescind their certification of the Plan Bay Area 2050 EIR, to void all project

27

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 9

1 approvals and entitlements and to refrain from reconsidering approval pending

2 recirculation and certification of a revised EIR that fully complies with CEQA;
3
2. For costs and attorney fees pursuant to CCP section 1021.5; and 4

5 3. For such other and further relief as the Court finds proper.
