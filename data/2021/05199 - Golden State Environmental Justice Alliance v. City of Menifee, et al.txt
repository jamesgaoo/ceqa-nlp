PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 3

2 The Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") for the Project failed to acknowledge

3 significant impacts regarding Air Quality, Biological Resources, Energy, and Greenhouse Gases,

4 and the City and City Council engaged in numerous other failures under CEQA as detailed in
this Petition.
5
3. Petitioner, Golden State Environmental Justice Alliance ("Petitioner" or
6
"GSEJA"), brings this action on its own behalf and on behalf of the general public as a private a
7

: attorney general to challenge the approvals at issue in this case.
8
4. This Petition is brought before the end of the tolling of the CEQA statute of
9

10 limitations under California Judicial Council Emergency Rule 9, as revised May 29, 2020, which
ends August 3, 2020, and in response to the filing of a Notice of Determination posted on or
11 about June 25,2020 after the Planning Commission decision on this Project. While the City may
12 claim that the matter is still pending and is not ripe due to the filing of an appeal by Petitioner
13

14 and others, Petitioner has been forced to file this Petition because the City would not agree to a
tolling agreement to delay the filing of this action in response to a posted Notice of
15 Determination under Public Resources Code section 21167.
16
4. Petitioner seeks to invalidate these approvals:
17
a. The certified and approved Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Haun and
18- Holland Mixed Use Project, State Clearinghouse No. 2020050348, and Menifee Planning
19 Commission Resolution PC 20- adopting the Mitigated Negative Declaration,
20 b. Planning Commission Resolution PC 20-_ adopting Planning Application
21 TPM 2016-185 (Approving Tentative Parcel Map No. 37121), and
22
C. Such further Resolutions of the City Council of Menifee approving this Project in
23 response to Petitioner's and others' appeals.
24 II. JURISDICTION AND VENUE
25
5. This Court has jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and
26 1094.5. The Court has jurisdiction of CEQA matters under Pub. Resources Code sections 21168,
27 21168.5, and 21168.9.
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA)
4

•

1
6. Venue is proper in this Court because the City of Menifee is within the
2 jurisdiction of Riverside County and the Project is located here as well, so the actions giving rise
3
to the causes of action herein transpired in Riverside County. "See Code of Civil Procedure
4
sections 393 and 394.
5
7. This action is timely filed within the tolling period for the statute of limitations
6
under Judicial Council Emergency Rule 9.
7
8. Petitioner has exhausted its administrative remedies by commenting on the
8 Project repeatedly before the close of the public hearing on the Project before a final Notice of
9 Determination was filed, in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21177(b).
10 9. Petitioner has complied with CEQA, Pub. Resources Code section 21167.5, by
11 filing and serving with this Petition for Writ of Mandate a Notice of Intent to File (a copy of
12 which is attached as Exhibit A). Petitioner has complied with CEQA, Pub. Resources Code
13

14 section 21167.6, in notifying the City of Petitioner's election to prepare the administrative
record. Petitioner has complied with CEQA's requirement that Petitioner notify the Attorney
15 General of the commencement of this action under Pub. Resources Code section 21167.7 and
16 Code of Civil Procedure section 388; a copy of Petitioner's Notice to the Attorney General will
17 be filed along with the present Petition.
18
III. PARTIES
19 10. Petitioner GSEJA is an advocacy organization devoted to the preservation of the
20 environment and the promotion of safe and healthy communities. Constituents of GSEJA reside
21 in Riverside County and would be irreparably harmed by the Project's environmental impacts.
22 GSEJA submitted comments on the Project. GSEJA sues on behalf of the public and is acting
23 as a private attorney general conferring a significant benefit on the general public or a large class
24 of persons under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.
25 11. Respondent City of Menifee ("City") is a public entity in western Riverside
26 County and the lead agency for the Project under CEQA. City is the agency charged with the
27 authority of regulating and administering land use and development within its territory in
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 5

1 compliance with its General Plan and zoning ordinances and applicable provisions of state law
2
including CEQA. As the lead agency for the Project, the City is charged with the duty of
3 ensuring compliance sith these applicable laws. m'
4
12. Respondent Menifee Planning Commission (*Planning Commission") is the entity
5 which approved the Project, after which the City filed a Notice of Determination ("NOD").
6

7 While the entity with the ultimate authority for deciding upon land use and solar energy projects
in the City is the City Council, Petitioner has filed an appeal with that entity, and Respondents
8 would not agree to a tolling of the CEQA statute of limitations after their filing of the NOD.
9
13. Real Party in Interest JPN Corporation ("JPN," or "the developer"), is a California
10 corporation listed as the Project Applicant on Respondent City's Mitigated Negative Declaration.
11 On information and belief, JPN's principal place of business is in San Diego, California.
12 14. Real Party in Interest Jim Nelson is listed as the Project Applicant on Respondent
13 City's premature NOD.
14 15. Real Parties in Interest Does I-XX are sued herein by fictitious name. Their true
15 name and capacity are unknown to Petitioner. When their true name and capacity are
16 ascertained, Petitioner will amend this Petition by inserting their true name and capacity.
17 Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the fictitiously named Real Parties
18
are responsible for the occurrences alleged herein.
19 16. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each of the Real
20
Parties gave consent to, ratified, or authorized the acts alleged, and that each of the Real Parties
21 knowingly aided, abetted or conspired with the others to commit the acts alleged herein.
22 IV. STATEMENT OF FACTS AND COMMON ALLEGATIONS
23 A. Standard of Review
24
17. The heart of CEQA is an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"). CEQA requires
25 an EIR "whenever it can be fairly argued on the basis of substantial evidence that the project
26

27 may have a significant environmental impact." No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.
3d 68, 75 (emphasis supplied); see also Quail Botanical Gardens Found, Inc. V. City of
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 6

Encinitas (1994) 29 Cal. App. 4th 1597, 1601, quoting Pub. Res. Code § 21100. And the
2

3 substantial evidence supporting such a fair argument need a not be the only evidence in the record,
so long as there is "substantial" evidence supporting that fair argument. CEQA Guidelines, §
4

5 15384(a). In other words, "CEQA imposes 'a low threshold requirement for preparation of an
EIR, and " if substantial evidence establishes a reasonably possibility of a significant
6
environmental impact, then the existence of contrary evidence in the administrative record is not
7 adequate to support a decision to dispense with an EIR.3 Sierra Club v. Cal. Dept. of Forestry
8 & Fire Prot. (2007) 150 Cal. App. 4th 370, 380, 381. Because there is substantial evidence of a
9 fair argument that the Project may have a significant impact on air quality, biological resources,
10
was
11 energy, greenhouse gases, and hydrology and hydrologic resources, and because there
substantial evidence that the Project was improperly segmented, an EIR was required.
12 B. Inadequate Assessment of Significant Impacts; Inadequate Discussion in the
13 MND; Conclusions Not Based on Substantial Evidence
14 1. Inadequate Project Description and Segmentation
15
18. The City engaged in "segmentation" or "piecemealing" by separating out some of
16 the grading for the Project from the subsequent development of the Project, and analyzing only
17

18- the grading, as "Phase 1." The City took the position that it was analyzing "a worst-case
development scenario," and that
19

20 All future implementing development projects will be required to prepare detailed project-specific analysis to ensure the individual development project does not

21 create impacts beyond what has been analyzed in terms of worst-case development assumptions requiring review and approval before development can
occur,
22 Response to Comment C-1, but (1) CEQA imposes a high threshold on subsequent analysis, so it
23 is highly unlikely there will be further CEQA review, and (2) the City did not analyze a worsts-
24 case scenario, as development of the Project site with a distribution a center is the most likely
25 outcome of grading the site, given it is immediately adjacent to the I-215 Freeway. Distribution
26 centers are major sources of regional emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx"), and local
27 emissions of diesel particulate matter ("DPM"), a probable human carcinogen.
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 7

1 19. CEQA requires analysis of the "whole" of an action, along with all of its
2
foreseeable effects. Deferring the analysis of the development of the Project for potential further
3

4 CEQA review violated the statute, and analyzing development of a scenario that was not.truly. +
the "worst case development scenario" violated the statute as well.
5
20. The Project description was also inadequate in two other respects: First, it did not
6 acknowledge that the Old Paloma Wash was a part of the Project site, and that it could be
7 affected even if it is not graded as a part of the Project, and Second, the Project description did
8
not identify multi-family residential development immediately to the east of the Project site,
9

10 zoned R-3 for 20.1-24 dwelling units per acre, presently occupied by the Cantabria Apartment

11 Homes. This second additional failing is relevant because the MND did not prepare a health risk
assessment ("HRA") to analyze the potential impacts of emissions of DPM from the Project site
12 on the surrounding community, including the highly sensitive Cantabria Apartment Homes.
13 2. Inadequate Assessment and Discussion of Air Quality Impacts; Improper
14 Tiering
15 21. The MND contained an inadequate discussion of the Project's air quality impacts
16 in at least three respects.
17
22. First, the MND's analysis of construction emissions of NOx was insufficient
18- because it assumed that Phase 1 and 1 Phase 2 grading would occur at different times, when there
19 was nothing to preclude them from occurring at the same time.
20 23. Second, the MND improperly concluded that emissions of NOx attributable to the
21 Project which were five times the South Coast Air Quality Management District's
22

23 ("SCAQMD's") threshold for significance would not lead to a significant impact because the
MND purported to "tier" off of the City's 2013 General Plan EIR (*2013 GP EIR"), and that
24 document had found that General Plan buildout would have a significant impact on air quality.
25

26 The City's attempt to "tier" off the 2013 GP EIR was legally impermissible because the City was
not permitted to prepare one EIR for the entirety of all development within its borders and to
27

28 conclude that all impacts thenceforth were not subject to review. The MND's finding with

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) g

1 respect to operational emissions is also flawed because it did not analyze worst-case emissions,
2

3 which would occur not from the development analyzed, which was predominantly the use of the
Project site for an auto sales center, but instead from use of the site as a distribution center.
4
24. Third, the MND failed to include a Health Risk Assessment ("an HRA") for
5

6 construction or operation. An HRA was necessary for construction because construction emits
DPM in large quantities, depending on EPA Tier for the construction equipment used. The
7 MND did not analyze the potential risks from construction of the Project at all - not qualitatively
8 and not quantitatively. Health risks from DPM also would arise from the Project's use as a
9

10 distribution center, because many trucks visit distribution centers, usually 24 hours a day, seven

11 days a week. An HRA that combined the risks from construction and operation was necessary to
assess whether the Project would lead to increased cancer risks of greater than 10 in a million,
12 which is SCAQMD's threshold of significance. 1
13
3. Biological Resources
14 25. There is substantial evidence of a fair argument that the Project may have a
15 significant impact on biological resources in at least three respects.
16 26. First, the City's MND did not comply with the California Department of Fish &
17

18 Wildlife's 2012 Staff Report on Burrowing Owl Mitigation, because the City's consultant did not
conduct survey visits at appropriately spaced intervals. Instead, the City's consultant did four
19 site visits in a less-than-two-week period, none in the spring. This minimized the likelihood of
20 finding owls, even though the MND acknowledged that they were present around the perimeter
21 of the site.
22
27.
23 Second, the MND did not provide for adequate mitigation for the owl, because the
2012 Staff Report calls for a boundary of 200 meters between construction and any nesting
24

25 burrowing owls, but the mitigation measure the City relied upon only called for a 300-foot
boundary. The closer boundaries would have a significant impact on any burrowing owls
26

27 While the MND purported to "tier" off of the 2013 GP EIR with respect to health risks, there
28 is no evidence that the 2013 GP EIR assessed health risks at all, or that it could have, given that it was a programmatic, City-wide EIR.
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 9

•

present, and the evidence supports the conclusion they are present.
2
28. Third, the MND falsely concluded that the Project would have no significant
3 impact on the Stephens' Kangaroo Rat ("SKR"), or the SKR Habitat Conservation Plan, because
4 the developer would pay a "mitigation fee." Petitioner cited the City to Riverside County
5

6 Ordinance No. 663, which provides that a city within the County's Fee Assessment Area must,

7 beyond merely assessing a fee, "determine[] that [a] development will not jeopardize the

8 implementation of a Habitat Conservation Plan for the [SKR]." It was impossible to determine
that the Project would have no significant impact on the SKR absent protocol surveys for the
9
animal.
10 4. Greenhouse Gas Impacts
11
29.
12 The MND's conclusion that the Project - which the City conceded would lead to

13 greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions of over 17,600 MTCO2e per year - would have insignificant

14 GHG impacts under CEQA was not based on substantial evidence, and the MND's discussion of

15 the subject was inadequate. The City again claimed there would be no significant impact

16 because the City's 2013 GP EIR had found a significant impact regarding GHGs, and the MND

17 supposedly "tiered" on the GP EIR - even though the MND acknowledged that emissions would

18 be about five times the California Air Resources Board's ("CARB's") recommended MTCO2e

19 per service population. The City's conclusion was not supported by substantial evidence and its

20 calculations supporting the conclusion that the Project would have no significant impact were a

21 failure to proceed by law. CARB's service population metric was intended for local agencies

22 that had prepared up-to-date climate action plans ("CAPs") that calculate all emissions for

23 residents within a geographic area, as the 2017 Scoping Plan Update clarifies. The City's

24 conclusions were inadequate because they were not based on an up-to-date CAP. Finally, the

25 City's threshold of significance was not adopted by ordinance, rule, or regulation, as required for

26 thresholds of significance and in particular for GHG thresholds of significance.
5. Energy Impacts
27
30.
28 The MND's discussion of Energy Impacts, another required CEQA subject, was

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 10

2 also inadequate, the City's conclusion that impacts were less than significant was not based on
substantial evidence, and the City's response to Petitioner's comments was inadequate. At least
two cases have found that a lead agency must do more than simply rely ön existing building "

5 codes to comply with CEQA's substantive mandate to reduce energy consumption. Petitioner

6 pointed out that the City was solely relying on building code compliance, but the City did
nothing to remedy this failure in its MND.
7
31.
8 The MND's discussion of energy impacts was further inadequate because it

9 merely reiterated several steps the developer was taking to comply with existing codes, and it

10 concluded impacts were insignificant compared to statewide energy use overall - a completely

irrelevant metric.
11 C. Inadequate Mitigation
12
32.
13 CEQA requires lead agencies to adopt all feasible mitigations regarding any

14 significant impacts, before a lead agency can adopt a statement of overriding considerations.

15 Here, the City failed to adopt several feasible mitigations which Petitioner and others identified

16 which could have reduced the severity of the Project's impacts. Those mitigations were required
because impacts were significant.
17

18 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
19 Circulation of an EIR
20 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000 et seq.]
21 33.
22 Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1-32 as if set forth in full.

34. An EIR must be prepared and circulated if there is any substantial evidence of a
23 fair argument that a Project may have a significant impact. Here, an EIR was required because
24 substantial evidence disclosed that:
25 There may be numerous significant impacts on air quality
26 There may be significant impacts on biological resources, including the burrowing owl
27 and the SKR
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 11

e There may be significant impacts regarding energy
2
0 There may be significant impacts on GHGs.
3

4.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
5 Failure to Analyze All Potentially Significant Impacts
6 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000 et seq.]
7 35. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs through 34 as if fully set
8
forth.
9 36. The MND failed to acknowledge potentially significant impacts regarding:
10
0 Air Quality
11
0 Biological Resources
12
® Energy, and
13
6 Greenhouse gases.
14 37. Any substantial evidence of a fair argument of a significant impact regarding
15 these areas is sufficient to require the City to prepare an EIR.
16 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
17 Failure to Adequately Mitigate All Potentially Significant Impacts
18- [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000 et seq.]
19 38. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 37 as if fully set
20 forth.
21
39. CEQA requires an agency to adopt feasible mitigation measures that will
22 substantially lessen or avoid the project's potentially significant impacts and to describe those
23 mitigation measures in the MND. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21081(a), 21100(b)(3); Guidelines
24 § 15126.4. In the case of an MND, this requirement is doubly important because mitigation of
25 impacts to a less-than-significant level is the only basis on which a lead agency may avoid the
26 preparation and circulation of an EIR.
27 40. The MND failed to adequately mitigate for multiple impacts, including but not
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 12

•

limited to on the burrowing owl.
2 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
3
Inadequate Project Description•
4 [CEQA, Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq.]
5
41. Petitioner reincorporates and realleges paragraphs 1 through 40 as if fully set
6
forth.
7
42. CEQA requires a finite and stable Project Description in an MND.
8
43. The MND failed to adequately describe this Project, periodically deferring
9 2 analysis for Phase 2 of the Project to a future date, and providing differing development
10 scenarios in the Appendices from that which was used in the MND itself.
11
44. Further, the MND failed to conduct a "worst case" analysis of development of the
12 Project site, because it failed to address the likely scenario of its development as a warehouse
13 distribution center.
14 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays
15 1. For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring the City to set aside its
16 decision approving the MND for the Project (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5,
17 21168.9, Code of Civil Procedure § § 1085, 1094.5),
18 2.
19 For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring the City to fully comply

20 with the requirements of CEQA before any future approval of the Project (Pub.
Res. Code §§ 21168, 21168.5, 21168.9, Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085,
21 1094.5),
22 3. For a judgment enforcing the duty imposed upon the City by CEQA to adequately
23 address potential individual and cumulative impacts to the environment in any
24 subsequent action taken regarding the Project,
25
4. For a judgment enforcing the duty imposed upon the City by CEQA to adequately
26 consider mitigation to reduce significant impacts in any subsequent action taken
27
to approve the Project,
28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (CEQA) 13

-
5. For a judgment requiring the City to prepare, circulate and consider a new and
2 legally adequate Environmental Impact Report and otherwise comply with CEQA
3 in any subsequent action taken to approve this Project,
4
6. For a judgment invalidating the City's approvals in connection with the proposed
5 Project;
6
7. For costs of suit, including attorney's fees under Code of Civil Procedure §
1021.5 and other provisions of law; and
8
8. For such other and further relief, including a stay or preliminary or permanent
injunctive relief, in the event that the Real Parties in Interest, or their agents or
10 instrumentalities, intend to commence construction on the site.
