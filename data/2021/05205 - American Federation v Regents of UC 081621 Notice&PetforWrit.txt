VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

INTRODUCTION

1. Petitioner American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees Local
3299 ("Local 3299" or "Petitioner") brings this action to challenge the unlawful actions of

4 Respondent The Regents of the University of California in certifying the Environmental Impact

5 Report ("EIR") for the University of California Berkeley's (*UC Berkeley") 2021 Long Range

6 Development Plan Update ("2021 LRDP Update") and Housing Projects #1 and #2 (collectively,

7 "the Project"), approving the 2021 LRDP Update and Housing Project #1, and making related

8 findings because the EIR fails to satisfy the requirements of the California Environmental Quality
seq., and the CEQA Guidelines, title 14, Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code § 21000 et

10 California Code of Regulations, § 15000 et seq.

11 2. The Project has three components: (1) the 2021 Long Range Development Plan

12 Update for the University of California, Berkeley campus (*2021 LRDP Update"), (2) Housing
13 Project #1, also referred to as Anchor House, and (3) Housing Project #2, also referred to as People's
14 Park.

15 3. UC Berkeley prepared and certified an Environmental Impact Report that included a
16 programmatic-level analysis for the 2021 LRDP Update and a project-level analysis for Housing
17 Projects #1 and #2. To date, the University has approved the 2021 LRDP Update and Housing Project
18 #1 ("Approvals") but has not approved Housing Project #2.
19
4.
20 In certifying the EIR, Respondent failed to comply with CEQA. More specifically,

21 Respondent prejudicially abused their discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law

22 by certifying an EIR that does not adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's significant

23 environmental impacts. The EIR also fails to provide a CEQA-compliant alternatives analysis,

24 response to comments, or statement of overriding considerations. As a result of these and other

25 deficiencies, the EIR fails as an informational document.

26 5. Because the EIR violates CEQA, the Approvals that are reliant upon it must be

27 overturned. Therefore, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court direct Respondents to set aside

28 the certification of the EIR and associated Project Approvals.

2 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

PARTIES

2 Petitioner and Plaintiff

3 6. Petitioner and Plaintiff American Federation of State, County, and Municipal
4 Employees Local 3299 is a public services employee union representing thousands of members 5 throughout the University of California system. Some of those members live, work, and recreate near 6

7 the UC Berkeley Campus and in Alameda County, including more than 950 who work at UC
Berkeley and the Lawrence
8 Berkeley National Lab. Local 3299's members are predominantly people

9 of color and are among the University of California's lowest-paid workers. Local 3299's purposes

10 include advocating for vital services that keep Local 3299 members and their families safe, make

11 their communities strong, and protect the environment.

12 7. Local 3299 and its members have a direct and beneficial interest in compliance with

13 laws bearing upon approval of the Project. These interests will be directly and adversely affected by

14 the Project, which violate provisions of law as set forth in this Petition and would cause substantial

15 harm to public safety, the natural environment, and the quality of life in the surrounding community.

16 Local 3299 and its members will suffer injury from adverse environmental impacts caused by the

17 construction and operation of the Project if the legal violations alleged in this Petition and Complaint

18 are not remedied. Local 3299 brings this action to represent and advocate for the beneficial interests
19 of its members in obtaining relief from these legal violations and to protect its members' safety,
20 advocate for affordable housing, improve quality of life, protect the environment, and ensure that the
21 University adheres to the requirements of CEQA in evaluating the Project. In addition, increased
22 demand for housing in the area surrounding the proposed Project is likely to harm Local 3299's
23 members who live in the area by raising rents, thereby causing economic injury or displacement or 24 both. Local 3299 actively participated in the Project's administrative approval process. Local 3299 25

26 expressed its concerns regarding the Project in writing to the University and urged the University to
remedy the EIR's deficiencies and to comply with CEQA. 27
8.
28 Local 3299 brings this action on behalf of itself, its members, and in the public
interest. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit on the general

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

public by requiring Respondents to carry out its duties under CEQA and other applicable laws before

2 approving the Project. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will also result in the

3 enforcement of important rights affecting the public interest by compelling Respondents to engage in

4 Project, and to ensure that the public has a meaningful opportunity a legally adequate analysis of the
5 to review and comment on the impacts and mitigation measures for the Project.

6 9. Local 3299 has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondent to set aside its
8 certificate of the EIR and the Approvals. In the absence of such remedies, the Regents' decisions
9 will remain in effect in violation of state law and Local 3299 and its members will be irreparably
10
harmed.
11
10.
12 Unless enjoined, Respondent will implement the Project despite its lack of

13 compliance with CEQA. Local 3299 will suffer irreparable harm by Respondent's failure to take the

14 required steps to comply with CEQA's procedures and protect the environment.

15 Respondent and Defendant

16 11. Respondent The Regents of the University of California ("Regents" or "University") is

17 a public trust corporation and state agency established pursuant to the California Constitution vested

18 with administering the University of California including the management and disposition of facilities

19 at the UC Berkeley Campus. The Regents is the lead agency under CEQA for consideration of

20 certification of the EIR and has principal responsibility for approving the 2021 LRDP Update,

21 Anchor House (also referred herein as "Housing Project #1"), and People's Park (also referred herein

22 as "Housing Project #2").

23 Real Parties in Interest and Defendants

24 12. Real Party in Interest University of California, Berkeley, is listed as the applicant on

25 the Notices of Determination for both the 2021 LRDP Update and Anchor House.

26 13. Petitioner and Plaintiff does not know the true names and capacities of Real Parties in
27 Interest and Defendants fictitiously named herein as DOES 1 through 10, inclusive. Petitioner is
28 informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that such fictitiously named Real Parties in Interest and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Defendants are responsible in some manner for the acts or omissions complained of or pending herein. Petitioner and Plaintiff will amend this Petition to allege the fictitiously named Real Party in
3 Interest's and Defendants' true names and capacities when ascertained.
4 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

5 14. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code
6 of Civil Procedure §§1085 and 1094.5 and Public Resources Code §§21168 and 21168.5. The Court
7 has jurisdiction to issue declaratory relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1060 and injunctive
8 relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 525 et seq.
9 15. Venue is proper pursuant to CCP §§ 393(b) (actions against public officers) and 395
10 (actions generally) because Respondent is an agency of the State of California. Venue is proper in
11 this Court because the causes of action alleged in this Petition and Complaint arose in the County of
12 Alameda, the Project will occur within the County of Alameda, and the environmental impacts of the
13 Project will be acutely felt within the County of Alameda.
14 16. This action was timely filed. Petitioner filed this Petition and Complaint prior to the
15 expiration of any applicable statute of limitations.
16 17. Petitioner performed all conditions precedent to filing this action by complying with 17 the requirements of PRC § 21167.5 by serving prior notice of the complaint in this action. A copy of 18 the written notice and proof of service is attached as Exhibit A to the Petition in this action. 19 18. Pursuant to PRC § 21167.6(b), Petitioner has elected to prepare the record of
20 proceedings in this matter, and is simultaneously filing their notice of intent to prepare said record of 21 proceedings with this Petition and Complaint. A true and correct copy of Petitioner's Notice of
22 Intent to Prepare Record is attached to this complaint as Exhibit B.
23 19. Petitioner will provide notice of this action to the Attorney General of the State of 24 California, by serving a copy of this Petition along with a notice of its filing, as required by PRC § 25 21167.7 and CCP § 388.
26 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
27 20. Local 3299 has actively participated in the administrative and environmental review
28 process prior to close of the public hearings on the Project and before the issuance of the Notices of

5 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Determination. Local 3299 has fully exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

2 Pub. Res. Code §21177(a).

3 21. CEQA allows a petitioner who objected to a project to allege in a petition all
deficiencies asserted by others. California Clean Energy Committee v. City of Woodland (2014) 225
Cal.App.4th 173, 191. Local 3299, agencies, interested groups, and individuals commented on

6 the Project and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition and Complaint.
7 22. The Regents has taken final agency actions certifying the EIR and adopting related

8 Project approvals and findings. The Regents had a mandatory duty to comply with all applicable
9

10 laws, including CEQA, prior to undertaking the discretionary approvals at issue in this Petition and

11 Complaint. Local 3299 possesses no effective remedy to challenge the Project approvals at issue in

12 this action other than by means of this lawsuit.

13 PROCEDURAL ALLEGATIONS

14 23. The University released a Draft EIR for public review in March 2021. The Draft EIR

15 addressed the 2021 LRDP Update, and the Anchor House and People's Park housing projects.

16 24. Many parties provided written comments on the Draft EIR, including Local 3299,
17 other organizations, public agencies, and individual members of the public.

18 25. In July 2021, the University released the Final EIR for the Project. The Final EIR
19 included responses to comments on the Draft EIR and revisions to the Draft EIR, among other

20 things.

21 26. On July 22, 2021, the University held a hearing on the Project and certified the Final

22 EIR for the 2021 LRDP Update and the Housing Projects, approved the 2021 LRDP Update,

23 approved the Anchor House project, and made related findings.

24 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

25 The Project and Project Site

26 27. The Project includes three components: (1) the 2021 LRDP Update, (2) Housing

27 Project #1 (Anchor House), and (3) Housing Project #2 (People's Park).
28

5 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 28. The 2021 LRDP Update is an overall land use plan intended to guide future growth
2 and development on the UC Berkley Campus over the next 15 years. It has a buildout horizon of the 3 2036-37 school year and is an update to the University's existing Long Range Development Plan 4 adopted in 2005, which had a buildout horizon year of 2020. The 2021 LRDP Update contemplates 5 an on-campus population of 67,200 persons (an increase of 12,071 from 2020 levels), an additional 6 8,096,249 square feet of development, and an additional 1,240 parking spaces covering 1,081,080
square feet of space for parking lots and parking structures. Draft EIR at 3-25. 8
29. The UC Berkely Campus is predominately located 9 within the cities of Berkley and
Oakland. Draft EIR at 3-6. 10 The "study area" used by the University for the EIR is contiguous with the

11 2021 LRDP Update planning area and includes the majority of UC Berkeley-owned properties. Draft

12 EIR at 3-8. However, it does not include UC Berkeley-owned properties outside of EIR study area,

13 including the University Village in Albany, the Richmond Field Station in Richmond, or various

14 properties outside of the city of Berkeley. Id.

15 30. Housing Project #1, also known as the Helen Diller Anchor House or Anchor House,

16 is specific development that is part of the 2021 LRDP and involves the demolition of the existing
17 on-site structures and the construction and operation of a new 16-story, 526,000 square foot mixed-
18 use building with a combination of residential, campus life, academic life, and other uses not operated|
19 by UC Berkeley. Draft EIR at 3-34. It is located immediately west of the Campus Park in Downtown 20 Berkeley, on a site bounded by Berkeley Way on the north, Oxford Street on the east, University
21 Avenue on the south, and Walnut Street on the west. Draft EIR at 3-35. Anchor House would provide
22 housing for 770 students and 46 employees. Draft EIR at 3-34.
23 31. The Anchor House site is currently occupied by eight apartment units (equivalent to 16 24 beds), surface parking, UC Berkeley office space, UC Berkeley's shuttle maintenance garage, and 25 vacant commercial buildings. Draft EIR at 3-35. UC Berkeley's shuttle garage, referred to as Oxford 26 Garage, is on the northeastern corner of the site and was built in 1930. Id. The garage is also listed is in 27

28 the California State Historic Resources Inventory and was designated City of Berkeley historical
landmark in 1981. Id.

7 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 32. Housing Project #2, also known as People's Park, is also a specific development that is

2 part of the 2021 LRDP Update and involves the demolition of the existing on-site structures and park

3 amenities and the construction and operation of two new mixed-use buildings with a combination of

4 residential, campus life, academic life, and other uses not operated by UC Berkeley. Draft EIR at 3-
50. Housing Project #2 would include three components: (1) a 17-story, 356,000 square foot student
6 housing building providing beds for 1,187 students and 8 faculty or staff, (2) a 91,970 square foot
affordable and supportive housing building that would house 125 residents, and (3) 82,000 square

8 feet of open space. Draft EIR at 3-51.

9
33. Housing Project #2 would be built at the current site of People's Park at 2556 Haste
10

11 Street. People's Park is a 2.8-acre park with current on-site uses including gardens and lawn space, a

12 restroom building. Draft EIR at 3- paved basketball court, picnic tables, a wooden stage, and a public

13 53. People's Park is currently primarily occupied by people without housing, in multiple

14 encampments. Id. Historically, People's Park has been known for being the site of protests and

15 State Historic Resources Inventory and is a City of community action. It is listed in the California
16| Berkeley historic landmark. Id.
17 Wildfire, Public Safety, and Evacuation Impacts

18 34. More than half of the UC Berkeley campus is designated a Very High Fire Severity

19 Zone, including all of Hill Campus West, Hill Campus East, Clark Kerr Campus, and many of the
20| City Environs properties. Draft EIR at 5.18-1, 3-8. New development in Very High Fire Severity

21 Zones increases the risk of fire ignition, which in turn increases the risk of exposing students,
22 residents, employees, and visitors to wildfire. "[A]s population increases and development further
23 encroaches into wildland vegetation, there is an increased risk that a human-caused ignition will

24 coincide in place in and time with hot, dry weather; flammable vegetation; and severe wind conditions,"
25 Syphard, A. K, Keely, J. E. (2020). Why Are So Many Structures Burning In California? Fremontia,
26 47(2), 28. The EIR fails to analyze and mitigate the increased risk of wildfire stemming from the
27 siting of additional development within Wildland Urban Interface Zones and Very High Fire Severity
28
Zones on campus.

8 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 35. In evaluating the hazards created by a project, CEQA Guidelines Appendix G requires
EIRs to analyze whether a Project will "[e]xpose people or structures, either directly or indirectly, to
3 a significant risk of loss, injury or death involving wildland fires." CEQA Guidelines Appendix G
4 §IX(g). The EIR does not adequately address this impact. The EIR does not include an analysis of 5 how the Project and its associated traffic and population increase will impact the ability of UC 6 students, staff, and faculty, as well as nearby neighborhoods, to evacuate in the event of a wildfire. 7

8 Nothing in the EIR analyzes whether the existing roadways are sufficient to accommodate the

9 evacuation of the increased UC campus population and surrounding neighborhoods, including the

10 additional cars and traffic resulting from the Project's increased parking and population. Moreover,

11 the EIR is silent on how the existing campus population plus an additional 12,000 people will be

12 safely evacuated in the event of a fire, including the tens of thousands who will access campus

13 without cars. Without this information, there is no evidence to support the EIR's conclusion that the

14 Project will not impair implementation or physically interfere with an adopted emergency response

15 plan or emergency evacuation plan.

16 36. With its July 17, 2021 comments, Petitioner submitted to Respondent the expert

17 comment of Professor Thomas Cova of the University of Utah who teaches and studies

18 environmental hazards, environmental management, and evacuation hazards. After reviewing the
19 EIR, Professor Cova explained that the it "fails to account for the increased cars accommodated by
20 the 1,240 additional parking spaces added by the LRDP, and the impact those cars will have on
21 evacuation capacity and timing. In addition, the EIR does not analyze how the thousands of additional
22 students and staff who access campus without cars will safely evacuate in the event of a wildfire or
23 other emergency." Cova at 1. "Without this information, it is impossible to determine if the Project 24 would substantially impair an adopted emergency response plan or emergency evacuation plan." Id. 25 37. The Final EIR's
26 response to comments by Petitioner and others raising concerns about

27 the Project's impacts on wildfire and safety were inadequate and conclusory. The EIR does not adopt

28 numerous additional mitigation measures suggested by the public, experts, and the City of Berkeley

9 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

to reduce wildfire and safety risks, and provides no explanation or evidence that such measures are

2 infeasible.

3 38. Mitigation Measure WF-3, meant to address some wildfire concerns, is uncertain,

4 unenforceable, and constitutes deferred mitigation. MM WF-3 provides: "[e]lectrical lines associated

5 with future electric infrastructure shall be undergrounded, where feasible. UC Berkeley shall verify

6 compliance with this measure as part of plan review prior to construction." Draft EIR at 5.18-26. The
EIR provides no definition for what is meant by "feasible" in the context of this measure. As a result,
the MM WF-3 does not require the University to underground any wires, as long as at some point
9

10 after the CEQA process is complete, it finds any reason at all that doing so would be infeasible.

11 Moreover, there is no evidence that it is infeasible to underground all electrical lines associated with

12 future electric infrastructure. Since the EIR concludes the Project's impact on wildfires is significant

13 and unavoidable, Respondent was required to adopt all feasible mitigation measures.

14 Transportation

15 39. The EIR's discussion of transportation and traffic impacts is deficient. The EIR

16 concludes that the Project will have a less than significant transportation impact because the Project is

17 "generally consistent with the transportation-related goals and policies in the UC Sustainable

18 Practices Policy and the UC Berkeley Sustainability Plan." Draft EIR at 5.15-47. In reaching this
19 conclusion, the EIR fails to analyze the impacts of the more than 12,000 additional people expected

20 to be on campus by the year 2036, together with the Project's increased reliance on public

21 transportation. Moreover, the EIR not address how the 2021 LRDP Update's increased reliance on

22 public transportation will impact public safety evacuation plans.
23 Public Services

24 40. The EIR fails to disclose or mitigate impacts to fire and emergency medical services.
25 The City of Berkeley noted in comments on the Draft EIR that "the Berkeley Fire Department
26 ("BFD") provides the vast majority of fire and emergency medical protection for the campus." Final
27 EIR at 5-115. The City of Berkeley explains that responding to calls for higher density and taller
28 apartment buildings- like the proposed Housing Project #1 and #2 - takes twice the staff and

10 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 additional fire engines because of the need to evacuate hundreds of people. Final EIR at 5-116. The
2 EIR acknowledges that "the BFD indicated that projected population growth and development
3 proposed by UC Berkeley over the buildout horizon of the proposed LRDP Update would require
4 significant additional resources and facilities in order for the BFD to adequately respond to calls for 5 service." Draft EIR at 5.13-17. Additional needed equipment includes an aerial ladder truck, type
fire engine, ambulance, mobile air supply truck, and battalion chief to accommodate the increased 7

8 density and height of projects under the proposed LRDP Update. Id. The EIR also acknowledges that

9 "[t]he BFD indicated that a new facility would need to be close to the Campus Park to house these

10 additional resources, and the BFD's Division of Training building would need to be expanded to meet

11 additional training demands of a larger department." Id.

12 41. CEQA requires an EIR to evaluate and mitigate any significant environmental impacts

13 caused by the need for new or expanded facilities to provide public services required by proposed

14 projects. CEQA Guidelines, Appendix G § XV. However, the environmental impacts of the new and

15 expanded facilities required by the Project are never analyzed or mitigated in the EIR.

16 42. In response to the City of Berkeley's comments, the Final EIR quotes the Draft EIR's
17 statement that "if and when the City of Berkeley would decide to construct a new facility in order to
18 accommodate additional resources, UC Berkeley would negotiate its proportional share of funding for
19 the mitigation of any environmental impacts resulting from the construction of the facility." Final EIR
20 at 5-115. This is not an adequate response to the City of Berkeley's comments (see Cleary v. County
21 of Stanislaus (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 348, 357), and fails to analyze the Project as a whole, including 22 it reasonably foreseeable indirect physical changes to the environment.
23 Historic, Cultural, and Tribal Resources
24 43. The EIR Study Area includes dozens of historic buildings by renowned architects. The 25 Project will result in the demolition of more than 40 buildings that have been or could be designated 26

27 as landmarks by the City of Berkeley and/or listed in the National Register of Historic Places.
44.
28 The Berkeley Architectural Heritage Association ("BAHA") commented that the EIR
does not contain a comprehensive survey detailing existing baseline condition for historic, tribal, or

1 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

cultural resources. BAHA also points out that the EIR's historic resource technical reports are based

2 on incomplete and incorrect information, impacted resources were omitted or misdescribed.

3 45. The EIR's discussion of impacts on these and other historic and cultural resources is

4 deficient. For instance, the EIR fails to evaluate the impacts of shadows on the First Church of Christ

5 Scientist, a historic landmark located directly across the street from the 17-story housing building
6 proposed for Housing Project #2. The Final EIR responds to comments on shadow impacts by
improperly claiming that they do not need to be analyzed under CEQA. See Bowman v. City of
8 Berkeley (2004) 122 Cal.App.4th 572, 586; South of Market Community Action Network v. San
9 was adequate in addressing shadow impacts
10 Francisco (2019) 33 Cal.App.5th 321, 349-350 (EIR

11 because it described the impacts in detail before concluding that there would be no significant

12 impact.). The EIR's failure to include information about the Project's shading impacts renders the

13 EIR inadequate as an informational document.

14 46. The EIR fails to adequately mitigate the Project's impacts to historic resources. The

15 EIR concludes that the Project's impacts on historical resources will be significant and unavoidable
16 despite the availability alternatives. Numerous experts, of additional feasible mitigation measures and

17 organizations, and members of the public, including the City of Berkeley, the Berkeley Landmark Heritage Association suggested additional 18 Preservation Committee, and the Berkeley Architectural
19 feasible mitigation measures that would reduce the Project's impacts on historical resources. These

20 suggested mitigation measures and alternatives were rejected without an adequate explanation and

21 without evidence of infeasibility.

22 47. The mitigation measures there were adopted to reduce impacts on historic resources

23 violate CEQA. For example, Mitigation Measures CUL-1.4 requires that, prior to approval of final
24 design plans for Housing Project #2, UC Berkeley shall retain an architect meeting the National Park

25 Service Professional Qualifications Standards for historic architecture to review plans for the
26 proposed student housing and affordable and supportive housing buildings. The historic architect is to
27 provide input and refinements to the design team regarding fenestration patterns, entry design, and

28 the palette of exterior materials to improve compatibility with neighboring historical resources and to

12 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

enhance compliance with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and the City of Berkeley Southside
2 Design Guidelines. Final EIR at 6-29. Mitigation Measure CUL-1.4 constitutes improperly deferred
3 mitigation because the EIR provides no reason why MM CUL-1.4 could not be conducted now, sO
4 that the design recommendations could be reviewed and commented on by the public during the 5 CEQA review process. In addition, MM CUL-1.4 includes no performance standards and does not 6

7 provide the types of actions that could feasibly achieve those standards. Moreover, while the measure

8 requires UC to retain a historic architect to provide input on how to reduce the impact of Housing

9 Project 2 on surrounding historical resources, it does not actually require UC to adopt any of the
architect's recommendations.
10
48.
11 The EIR's conclusion that the Project's impacts on tribal cultural resources (*TCR") is

12 less-than-significant after mitigation is not supported by the evidence or the law. The EIR claims that

13 Mitigation Measure CUL-2 and CBP CUL-1 would reduce Project impacts on TCRs below

14 significance. Draft EIR, 5.16-8. Mitigation Measure CUL-2 provides a process for consultation

15 between the consulting archeologist and the appropriate tribe to "recommend appropriate and feasible
16 avoidance, testing, preservation, or mitigation measures." It does not require avoidance if feasible.

17 Draft EIR at 5-4-43 and 5-4-44. This approach cannot be relied on as the basis for concluding that the
18 Project's impact on TCR would be less-than-significant. See, Save the Agoura Cornell Knoll v. City
19 of Agoura Hills (2020) 46 Cal.App.5th 665, 731-33 [mitigation measure requiring completion of data
20 recovery program if preservation becomes impossible does not mitigate impact to a less-than-
21 significant level].
22 Greenhouse Gas
23 49. The EIR's discussion of greenhouse gas effects is inadequate. For instance, there is no is 24 evidence that it is feasible to reduce the Project's significant greenhouse gas emissions to less-than-
25 significant level, including through the purchase of offset credits.
26 In addition, the UC Berkeley 2020

27 Sustainability Goals require that the UC Berkely Campus be climate neutral for scope 1 and 2 sources

28 and at least 40 percent of the natural gas combusted onsite must be biogas by 2025. Draft EIR at 5.7-
19 to 20, 5.7-26. But the EIR contains no discussion specific to how the Project would advance or

13 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 hinder meeting those requirements or the many other climate-goals discussed in the EIR. Further, the

2 EIR claims the University will start purchasing offsets to comply with the UC Sustainability Policy in

3 2025 to meet net-zero requirements for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, but the EIR does not explain how it
will reduce its GHG impacts to a less than significant level prior to 2025.
5 Biological Resources

6 50. The EIR's discussion of the Project's impacts on biological resources is inadequate.
7 Petitioner's April 21, 2021 comment on the Draft EIR includes the comments of expert wildlife

8 ecologist Dr. Shawn Smallwood, Ph.D who reviewed the EIR and found that the it: (1) failed to
9

10 establish a proper baseline for wildlife; (2) failed to adequately analyze impacts due to habitat loss;

11 (3) improperly analyzed the Project's impact on wildlife movement; (4) failed to disclose, analyze,

12 and mitigate the Project's impacts to wildlife due to window/vehicle collisions and energy use; (5)

13 inadequately analyzed the Project's cumulative impacts; and (6) failed to incorporate all feasible

14 mitigation measures.

15 51. The Final EIR does not adequately respond to Dr. Smallwood's comments. For
16 instance, in response to Dr. Smallwood's comments that the Project will have a significant impact on

17 biological resources as a result of habitat loss, the Final EIR states that "preconstruction surveys

18 would be necessary during nesting season to confirm whether proposed development or vegetation

19 management activities would adversely affect nesting birds where suitable habitat is present." Final

20 EIR at 5-423. This response ignores the ongoing impact on species resulting from habitat loss.

21 Housing and Population

22 52. The UC Berkeley campus has the lowest percentage of beds for the student body of

23 any campus in the UC system, requiring many to seek housing in the cities surrounding campus, and
24 cities further away. Draft EIR at 3-2.
25 53. The EIR includes an additional 8,492 students, approximately 71% (6,032 students) of
26 whom will live off-campus in the City of Berkley. Draft EIR at 5.12-9. In addition, the EIR includes
27 an additional 3,579 faculty and staff, 29% (1,037) of whom are expected to live in Berkeley. Id. In
28
total, this amounts to an additional 7,069 people who will need to find housing in the City of Berkley.

14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 The City of Berkeley's entire housing stock in 2020 included only 51,523 units. Draft EIR at 5.12-11.
2 To house an additional 7,069 people will require additional housing to be built in Berkeley, and the
3 EIR failed to analyze the impact of this necessity. As the Alameda County Superior Court recently
4 held, "[i]ncreases in campus population foreseeably lead to direct and indirect impacts on housing,
5

6 population, and displacement, and the failure to consider those impacts constitutes prejudicial abuse

7 of discretion." Save Berkeley's Neighborhoods v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., Alameda Sup. Ct. at p. 16

8 (Case No. 19022887) ("SBN v. Regents") (attached hereto as Exhibit C).
54.
9 The EIR defends the growth as minimal in relation to regional growth. Draft EIR at

10 5.12-15. A regional comparison does not account for, mitigate, and analyze alternatives to the

11 specific growth-inducing effects of the Project in the particular area in which it is located, including

12 relating to housing. See SBN v. Regents at 14 (Exhibit C).

13 55. In addition to requiring construction of new housing, increased demand for housing in

14 the neighborhoods surrounding campus will also cause displacement of longtime low- and middle-

15 income families because the more than 7,000 new employees and students will flood the surrounding

16 rental market, driving up prices and forcing current renters out.

17 56. The EIR assumes full buildout of the 2021 LRDP Update's development by 2036,

18 a along with a significantly increased campus population, but the EIR and 2021 LRDP Update do not
19 link the amount of campus population growth with the development of new campus housing, and no
20 mitigation measure requires the same. As a result, the full campus-population increase could occur
21 without construction of any additional housing. If this does occur, the impacts on housing in
22 Berkeley, Oakland, and other nearby cities would be even greater. The EIR fails to analyze the 23 environmental impact of additional housing that will be needed in the City of Berkeley and
24 elsewhere to make up for such a shortcoming.
25 57.
26 No EIR has been prepared that analyzes UC Berkeley's past campus population

27 increase above what was analyzed in the LRDP adopted in 2005. The University improperly

28 attempts to boot-strap these past population increases into the Final EIR, while also claiming that the
EIR does not need to analyze the impacts of anticipated future campus population growth. Both are

15 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 inconsistent with recent Court rulings in Save Berkeley Neighborhoods v. The Regents et al (Case

2 No. RG19022887) and The City of Berkeley v. The Regents et al. (Case No. RG19023058) (the

3 "Enrollment Cases Decision"), which made it clear that UCB must it treat its planned population

4 growth as a "project" for CEQA purposes.

5 Impacts to Human Health from Toxic Air Contaminants in Indoor Air.

58. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, evaluate, and mitigate the Project's significant
adverse impact with to respect to impacts on human health as a result of formaldehyde emissions in
8 indoor air, and its conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence.
9
59. The EIR fails to disclose, evaluate, and mitigate the Project's significant health risks to

10

11 future residents and workers at future buildings that are planned as part of the 2021 LRDP Update,

12 including Housing Projects #1 and #2, resulting from the emissions of formaldehyde into the indoor

13 air. Formaldehyde is a toxic air contaminant (*TAC*). TACs are pollutants with the potential to

14 cause significant adverse health effects. Many composite wood products typically used in building

15 construction contain formaldehyde-based glues which off-gas formaldehyde over a very long time

16 period. The primary source of formaldehyde indoors is composite wood products manufactured with
17 urea-formaldehyde resins, such as plywood, medium density fiberboard, and particle board. These

18 materials are commonly used in building construction for flooring, cabinetry, baseboards, window

19 shades, interior doors, and window and door trims. The Bay Area Air Quality Management District

20 ("BAAQMD") has established a significance threshold of health risks for carcinogenic TACs of 10 in

21 a million.

22 60. Certified Industrial Hygienist, Francis "Bud" Offermann, PE, CIH, conducted a review

23 of the Project, the EIR, and relevant documents regarding the Project's indoor air emissions. Mr.

24 Offermann concluded that future residents of the Project will be exposed to a cancer risk from
25 formaldehyde of approximately 120 per million, assuming all materials are compliant with the
26 California Air Resources Board's formaldehyde airborne toxics control measure. This is more than 12
27 times the BAAQMD's CEQA significance thresholds for airborne cancer risk of 10 per million.

28

16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 61. The Final EIR also fails to adequately respond to comments on the Draft EIR raising
2 this issue. For instance, in response to comments, the EIR dismisses Mr. Offerman's comments as
3 speculative, but never provides additional detail on the types of building materials that would be used,|
4 or investigates and discloses what the Project's formaldehyde emissions would actually be, and what
5 health impact that would have. The Final EIR also claims there is no need to analyze this impact
because the Project will follow Campus Design Standards, which build off of other applicable
regulations such requiring the use of materials meeting the CARB Phase 2 standard. Final EIR at 5- 8

9 443-44. This does not adequately respond to Mr. Offermann's comment because Mr. Offermann's

10 analysis is clear that the increased cancer risk of 120 per million is based on materials that already
meet CARB Phase 2 standards.
11
Alternatives 12

13 62. Project Alternative D proposes "Increased Faculty and Staff Housing." Draft EIR at 6-

14 59. "Under Alternative D, the Increased Faculty and Staff Housing Alternative, the proposed LRDP

15 Update would include an additional 1,000 beds for faculty and staff within the Hill Campus East and

16 the Clark Kerr Campus." Id. The only other detail provided about this alternative is as follows: "The

17 Hill Campus East would absorb an additional 600 beds and 400 additional beds would be included

18 under redevelopment within the Clark Kerr Campus. While no specific sites have been selected for
19 development on the Hill Campus East for this alternative, it is assumed that any new development
20 would be located in close proximity to existing development and infrastructure.» Id. Without
21 explanation the EIR arbitrarily sited additional staff and faculty housing at an undisclosed location
22 within the area of campus with the most undeveloped natural habitat, the most risk of fire, and the
23 most difficult soil issues. Hill Campus East includes 760-acres of land, much of which is undeveloped 24 and hilly, and which is considered a Very High Fire Severity Zone. Noting only that an additional 600 25 beds would be located somewhere in the 760-acre Hill Campus East, the EIR's description of 26

27 Alternative D is not sufficient to allow the public and decision makers to meaningfully evaluate,
analyze, and compare Alternative D with the Project. 28

17 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 63. The EIR's conclusion that the impacts of Alternative D would be greater than the

2 Project's impacts on aesthetics, biological resources, geology and soils, utilities and service systems,

3 and wildfire are not supported by substantial evidence because the analysis is based on unstated and

4 unsupported assumptions about where the additional staff and faculty housing will be located in Hill

5 Campus East.
6 64. The EIR failed to evaluate a reasonable range of alternatives that would feasibly attain
7 most of the basic objectives of the Project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the
8 significant effects of the Project. A reasonable range of alternatives should have included an analysis
9 of additional student, staff, and faculty housing that did not include development in open space found

10

11 in Hill Campus East, which is the is most undeveloped, hilly, and fire-prone area of the entire campus.

12 Among other options, UC should have looked at locating the additional housing on the dozens of

13 for redevelopment, increased the density of Anchor House by parcels already deemed appropriate

14 building additional floors, or providing housing on UC Berkley-owned City Environs properties or on

15 other UC Berkeley-owned sites outside of the EIR study area. The EIR also improperly failed to
16 evaluate an alternative that limited campus population to a lower level. Compared to the Project and

17 Alternative D, any of these alternatives would have reduced environmental impacts and should have

18 been considered. Siting additional staff and faculty housing in Hill Campus East acted as a poison

19 pill, meant to defeat the environmental superiority of this alternative.

20 65. In addition, the alternatives analysis did not contain reasonable range of alternatives

21 that would reduce the impacts of the Project, including Housing Projects #1 and #2, on historical

22 are 39 sites identified as candidate sites for new buildout within resources. The EIR notes that there

23 the LRDP area that are not designate as historical resources. Final EIR at 6-63. The EIR provides no

24 evidence that housing and other development could not be sited on these parcels, eliminating or
25 substantially reducing the Project's irreversible destruction of historic resources currently at the sites

26 of Housing Project #1 and 2. Moreover, the EIR did not analyze alternative locations, including off-
27 campus locations such as UC Berkeley City Environs properties, Richmond Bay Campus/Richmond
28 Field Station, the Mills College Campus, Albany Village, satellite UC Berkeley campuses, or other

18 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

off-campus sites, that would reduce or eliminate the impacts of Housing Project #1 and 2 on historic
2 resources.

3 66. Petitioner and other members of the public raised these issues in written and oral
4 comments on the Draft EIR, but the Final EIR did not adequately respond to such comments and 5 dismissed proposed alternatives as infeasible without supporting evidence or legal justification. 6 Noise and Vibration
7
67. The EIR's discussion of noise impacts is deficient. No acoustical report was prepared 8 by an expert in support of the EIR's analysis of potential noise impacts. To fill this informational gap,

10 Petitioner submitted comments of noise expert Deborah A. Jue, INCE-USA, of the firm Wilson Ihrig,

11 who reviewed the EIR and found that it lacked substantial evidence to support baseline noise levels.

12 Ms. Jue also suggested additional feasible mitigation measures to further reduce the Project's

13 significant and unabideable impacts. The Final EIR did not adopt these mitigation measures, despite

14 no evidence of infeasibility.

15 68. The EIR's discussion of construction-related vibration impacts is also deficient. The

16 EIR is not supported by geotechnical report, and no information is provided about the subsurface

17 conditions of the sits of Housing Projects #1 and #2.

18 69. In addition, numerous parties and experts commented on the Project's impact on
19 historic resources near the Project as a result of pile driving during construction. The Final EIR
20 responds by noting an intention to use alternative construction methods that do not include
21 piledriving for Housing Projects #1 and #2, and for future LRDP projects "if feasible." This
22 constitutes improperly deferred and uncertain mitigation in violation of CEQA. Moreover, the Final
23 EIR does not disclose or analyze the vibratory impact of alternative construction methods on nearby 24 historic structures.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 Violation of CEQA- Inadequate EIR

3 (Pub. Resources Code §21000, et seq. and CEQA Guidelines § 15000 et seq.)

4 70. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate all of the above paragraphs as if fully set

5 forth herein.

71. CEQA was enacted by the legislature to ensure that the long-term protection of the
environment is guiding criterion in public decisions. Pub. Res. Code, § 21001(d). CEQA requires

8 the lead agency for a project with the potential to cause significant environmental impacts to prepare

9 an EIR for the project that complies with the requirements of the statute, including, but not limited

10 to, the requirement to disclose and analyze the project's potentially significant environmental 11  impacts. Pub. Res. Code, §§21002.1(a), 21100(a), 21151(a); 14 CCR §§15064(a)(1), (f)(1), 15367.

12 The EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such that the decisionmakers can
13 intelligently and fully consider environmental consequences when acting on the proposed project.

14 Such analysis must include and rely upon thresholds of significance that are based on substantial

15 evidence in the record.

16 72. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency analyze and adopt feasible and enforceable

17 mitigation measures that would reduce or avoid each of a project's significant environmental impacts.

18 PRC § 21061; see also §21002.1. If any of the project's significant impacts cannot be mitigated to a
19 less than significant level, then CEQA bars the lead agency from approving : project if a feasible is 20 alternative is available that would meet the project's objectives while avoiding or reducing its
21 significant environmental impacts.

22 73. Each of the lead agency's findings and conclusions, including those in the EIR, must

23 be supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record, and the agency must explain how
24 the evidence in the record supports the conclusions the agency has reached. Topanga Assn. for a

25 Scenic Community v. County of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506, 515.
26 74. Respondent committed prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a

27 manner required by law because the Project relies on an EIR that fails to meet the CEQA's

28 requirements for the disclosure, analysis, mitigation, reduction, and/or avoidance of significant

20 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 environmental impacts from the Project, including direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts relating to
2 wildfire, public safety, public services, historic, cultural, and tribal resources, transportation,
3 greenhouse gas emissions, biological resources, housing and population, human health, and noise and
4 vibrations. These deficiencies rendered the EIR inadequate as an environmental document and
5 precluded informed decision making and informed public participation.
6
75. Wildfire, Public Safety, and Evacuation. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, 7 analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's significant direct, indirect, and cumulative wildfire-related 8 impacts. The EIR's analysis of wildfire-related impacts is inadequate because, inter alia, the EIR: 9
a. fails to analyze and mitigate all the increased potential for wildfire ignitions resulting 10 from siting additional housing and development in Wildland Urban Interface Zones 11 and Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zones; 12

13 b. fails to analyze and mitigate whether the Project will expose people or structures to a
significant risk of loss, injury or death involving wildland fires; 14
C. fails to provide sufficient information to determine how the Project's traffic and 15 population increases will impact evacuation times and procedures and whether it will 16 interfere with existing emergency and evacuation plans; 17
d. fails to support its findings that the Project will not physically interfere with an 18 adopted emergency response plan or emergency evacuation plan with substantial 19
evidence;
20
e. fails to adopt all feasible mitigation measures to reduce the Project's significant and 21 unavoidable wildfire and safety impacts; and 22 f. adopts mitigation measures that do not comply with CEQA. 23 76. Transportation. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the 24

25 Project's significant direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on public transportation.
77.
26 Public Services. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the

27 Project's significant direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on the environment from the need for

28 new or expanded public services. The EIR's analysis of public services impacts is inadequate
because, inter alia, the EIR:

21 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 a. fails to disclose, analyze, and mitigate impacts stemming from additional facilities and

2 equipment needed by fire and police a services as a result of the Project;

3 b. fails to anlayze the impacts of the project as a whole, including in direct impacts; and

4 C. fails to adequately respond to comments raising concerns about the impacts on the
environment caused by the need for new or expanded facilities to provide public

6 services.

7
78. Cultural and Tribal Resources. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or
8 mitigate the Project's significant direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts on cultural and tribal

9 resources. The EIR's analysis of cultural and tribal resources impacts is inadequate because, inter
10

11 alia, the EIR:

12 a. fails to require all feasible mitigation measures and alternatives;

b.
13 fails to adequately respond to comments;

14 c. adopts deferred mitigation that violates CEQA;

a.
15 fails to support its finding that the Project's impacts on tribal cultural resources will be

16 less-than-significant with mitigation.

17 79. Greenhouse Gases. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the

18 indirect, and cumulative greenhouse gas effects. The EIR's analysis of greenhouse Project's direct,

19 gas impacts is inadequate because, inter alia, the EIR:

20 a. fails to support its selection of thresholds of significance with substantial evidence in

21 the record;

22 b. relies on greenhouse gas mitigation measures that are vague, ineffective, deferred,

23 and/or unenforceable;

24 C. fails to incorporate all feasible mitigation and avoidance measures;

25 d. impermissibly relies on off-site offsets to mitigate Project's greenhouse gas emissions

26 because the EIR fails to provide substantial evidence that such offsets are available,

27 real, permanent, quantifiable, verifiable, and enforceable reductions; and
28

22 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

I e. fails to discuss how the Project would affect the ability to meet the Regents'
2 requirements for the UC Berkeley Campus.
80. Biological Resources. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate
4 the Project's significant direct and cumulative impacts to biological resources. The EIR's analysis
of impacts on biological resources is inadequate because, inter alia, the EIR: 6 a. fails to establish a proper baseline for wildlife;
b. fails to adequately analyze impacts due to habitat loss; 8
C. analyzes the Project's impact on wildlife movement using an improper standard; 9
d.
10 failing to disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's impacts to wildlife due to

11 window/vehicle collisions and energy use;

12 e. inadequately analyzes the Project's cumulative impacts; and

13 f. fails to incorporate all feasible mitigation measures.

14 81. Population, Housing, and Growth Inducement. The EIR fails to adequately

15 disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's significant direct and cumulative impacts on
16 population, housing, and grown inducement. The EIR's analysis of impacts on impacts on
17 population, housing, and grown inducement is inadequate because, inter alia, the EIR:
18 a. fails to consider the direct and indirect impacts of the Projects' increased campus
19 population on housing, population, and displacement;
20 b. fails to adequately discuss the need for construction of additional housing;
21 C. fails to adequately anlayze the Project's cumulative impact on housing and population
22 growth;
23 d. fails to anlayze the impacts of an increased student and staff population without 24 additional housing beyond Housing Projects #1 and 2; and 25 e. fails to analyze impacts of past and projected campus population growth. 26
82. Health Hazards from TAC Emissions. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, 27
and/or mitigate the Project's significant direct and cumulative impacts on human health from the 28

23 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

emissions of TACs in indoor air. The EIR's analysis of impacts on human health from TAC

2 emissions is inadequate because, inter alia, the EIR:

3 a. fails to disclose and mitigate the impact despite substantial evidence that it will be

4 significant;

5 b. fails to adopt feasible mitigation measure to reduce the significant impact; and

6 C. fails to adequately respond to comments on the Draft EIR providing substantial
evidence of a significant impact not analyzed and mitigated by the EIR.

83. Baseline. The EIR fails to adequately describe the existing physical environmental
9 conditions in the vicinity of the Project, including but not limited to environmental conditions relating
10 to the Project's impacts to biological resources, wildfire, noise, vibrations, historic resources, and
11
population.
12
84.
13 Alternatives. The EIR fails to provide an adequate selection and discussion of

14 alternatives for consideration that foster informed decision-making and informed public

15 participation. The alternatives analysis in the EIR does not meet CEQA's requirement that an EIR
consider a reasonable range of alternatives that lessen the Project's significant environmental
16 impacts, does not focus on alternatives that either eliminate adverse impacts or reduce them to

17 failed to consider

18 insignificance even if they would to some degree impede the Project's objectives,

19 a feasible alternative that would lessen significant impacts, unlawfully rejects alternatives without

20 adequately analyzing whether their impacts would be less significant that the Project's, and fails to
support
21 with substantial evidence its conclusions regarding alternatives.

85.
22 Response to Comments. The responses to comments in the Final EIR fail to meet

23 CEQA's requirements in that they neither adequately dispose of all the issues raised, nor provide

24 specific rationale for rejecting suggested Project changes, including the consideration or adoption of

25 feasible mitigation measures or alternatives. CEQA requires that a lead agency evaluate and respond

26 to all environmental comments on the Draft EIR that it receives during the public review period. The

responses
27 must describe the disposition of the issues raised and must specifically explain reasons for

28 rejecting suggestions and for proceeding without incorporating the suggestions. The Final EIR's

responses to comments fail to satisfy the requirements of law. Failing to adequately respond to

24
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 comments rendered the Final EIR inadequate as an informational document.
2 86. Based upon each of the foregoing reasons, the EIR is legally defective under CEQA.
3 Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in violation of CEQA in approving the Project. As
4 such, the Court should issue a writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside the certification of
5 the EIR and approval of the Project.
6 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
7 Violation of CEQA - Inadequate Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations

8 (Pub. Res. Code § 21000, et seq. and CEQA Guidelines $ 15000 § et seq.)
87.
9 Petitioner hereby reallege and incorporates all of the above paragraphs as if fully set
forth herein.
10
88.
11 Respondents' Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations violate the

12 requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. Respondents' findings fail to identify the changes

13 or alterations that are required to avoid or substantially lessen the project's significant environmental

14 effects, and do not provide adequate reasoning or disclose the analytic route from facts to

15 conclusions, as required by law. The purported benefits of the Project cited in the Statement of

16 Overriding Considerations do not outweigh the Project's substantial costs to public health and the

17 environment. Respondents' Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations are not supported

18 by substantial evidence in the record.

19 89. When an EIR concludes that a project would result in significant environmental

20 effects, but where mitigation measures and alternatives identified in the EIR are deemed infeasible,

21 the CEQA findings must identify the specific economic, legal, social and technological and other
22 considerations that make infeasible the adoption of mitigation measures or alternatives. All CEQA
23 findings must be supported by substantial evidence in the record and must disclose the analytical
24 route by which approval of a project is justified. Here, the findings regarding the impacts, mitigation
25 measures, and alternatives relied upon by Respondent's approval of the Project are not supported by
26 substantial evidence in the record, and do not disclose the links between evidence and conclusions.
27 90.
28 As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent failed to proceed in a manner required
by law, and its decision to approve the Project and adopt Findings of Fact and a Statement of

25 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Overriding Considerations was not supported by substantial evidence.

2 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

Petitioners City of Berkeley and Save Berkeley's Neighborhoods commenced two actions
seeking a writ of mandate from the Court directing respondent The Regents of the University of
California ("UC") to set aside a determination of May 16, 2019. (AR1.) UC approved a new

4 development project to create additional academic and residential space for UC Berkeley's

5 Goldman School of Public Policy ("GSPP") on Hearst Avenue (the "Upper Hearst

6 Development"). (AR1.) To document its considerations of the environmental impact of its

7 project under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), UC certified a Supplemental
8 Environmental Impact Report, which tiered from its 2020 Long Range Development Plan
9| Environmental Impact Report (*2020 LRDP EIR") and made minor amendments to it. (AR1.)

10 For the following reasons, the court grants the writs of mandate. The parties vigorously

11 debate whether the project description was consistent or appropriately defined. UC Berkeley's

12 concession that both the project and its "baseline" are subject to judicial review makes much of
concludes that the environmental analysis was legally 13 this debate besides the point. The court
14 insufficient in several respects, and that it cannot accordingly endorse the failure to consider a
15 reduced enrollment alternative.

16 LEGAL STANDARDS

17 The Legislature intended CEQA "to be interpreted in such a manner as to afford the
18 fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory

19 language." (Sierra Club v. County of Fresno (2018) 6 Cal.5th 502, 511, quoting Laurel Heights

20 Improvement Assn. v. The Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 390.) *With

21 narrow exceptions, CEQA requires an EIR whenever a public agency proposes to approve or to

22 carry out a project that may have a significant effect on the environment.* (Ibid., citing same at

23 pp.390-391.) Because the EIR must be certified or rejected by public officials, it is a document

24 of accountability." (Id. at p.512, citing same at p.392.) The general public, "being duly
25 informed, can respond accordingly to action with which it disagrees." (Ibid., citing same.)

26 When the Court finds a violation of CEQA, a writ must issue. (Pub. Res. Code § 21168.9(b).)

2

1 When the Court is asked to review the decision of a public agency for compliance with

2 CEQA, its review "extend{s] only to whether there was a prejudicial abuse of discretion." (Pub.
Res. Code § 21168.5.) A public agency has abused its discretion if either (1) the agency "has not
proceeded in a manner required by law" or (2) the agency's decision is "not supported by

5 substantial evidence." (Ibid.) "Judicial review of these two types of error differs significantly:

6 While we determine de novo whether the agency has employed the correct procedures,
7 "scrupulously enforc[ing] all legislatively mandated CEQA requirements" [citation), we accord

8 greater deference to the agency's substantive factual conclusions.» (Sierra Club, supra,

9 6 Cal.5th at p.512, quoting Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of
10 Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 435.) Reviewing factual findings, the Court "will

11 resolve reasonable doubts in favor of the administrative decision[] and will not set aside an

12 agency's determination on the ground that the opposite conclusion would have been equally or

13 more reasonable.™ (Id. at p.515.)

14 II. INCREASES IN STUDENT ENROLLMENT AND CAMPUS POPULATION

15 A. ENROLLMENT - "UPDATED BASELINE"

16 In the SEIR, UC Berkeley undertook to study the environmental impacts of the existing
17 || higher-than-projected campus population as part of the description of an "updated baseline."
18 The SEIR states that its study of past population increase is not as part of the "project" as that

19 term is used in CEQA. (See AR60, 101-103; AR847; see Guidelines § 15378 [defining "Project"

20 as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change

21 in the environment, or I reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment" and
22 subject to direction, funding, or discretionary permission by a public agency].) According to the

23 SEIR, UC Berkeley studied the impacts of the increase in its population leading to its "updated
24 baseline"-even though that increase was not part of the project--because "in its response to

25 comments to the 2020 LRDP EIR, UC Berkeley made a commitment to the City of Berkeley

26

3

1 that, if enrollment increased beyond the projections set forth in the 2020 LRDP, it would

2 undertake additional review under CEQA." (AR60.)

3 It is important to distinguish the SEIR's "updated baseline" analysis from the normal use

4 of the term "baseline" under CEQA. Ordinarily, an environmental impact report studies the
impacts of a project on the environment. To determine and measure those impacts, the lead

6 agency must determine the environmental conditions as they exist at the time it files its notice of
7 preparation for the project. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, div. 6, ch.3, ["Guidelines"] § 15125(a).)
8 Under Guidelines section 15125, "[a]n EIR must include a description of the physical

9 environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project." (Guidelines § 15125(a).) "This

10 environmental setting will normally constitute the baseline physical conditions by which a lead

11 agency determines whether an impact is significant." (Ibid.) "The purpose of this requirement is

12 to give the public and decision makers the most accurate and understandable picture practically
13 possible of the project's likely near-term and long-term impacts." (Ibid.)

14 The "updated baseline" discussion in the SEIR serves to serve two purposes. First, the to

15 SEIR describes the current campus population as the baseline for its environmental impact

16 analyses of the Upper Hearst Development, including the impact of further population increases.

17 Second, the SEIR includes an analysis for purely informational purposes to "update" the 2020

18 LRDP EIR's projected population-related impacts analyses to analyze the impacts of the increase

19 in campus population above the level studied in the 2020 LRDP EIR (the "Excess Population").

20 The SEIR discusses the potential impacts of the Excess Population and finds that it has had no

21 significant environmental impacts. (See AR101-103.) The SEIR does not consider alternatives

22 to the to enrollment levels that led to Excess Population and does not adopt mitigation measures

23 beyond those already adopted in the 2020 LRDP EIR.

24 The unusual structure of the SEIR's "update" analysis stems at least partly from an issue

25 of legal interpretation. When it was certified in 2005, the 2020 LRDP EIR had projected that
26 student enrollment at UC Berkeley would stabilize at around 33,450 students. (AR2134

4

1 ["[O]nce our current target is reached, at an estimated two-semester average of 33,450 students,

2 enrollment at UC Berkeley should stabilize."]; see also AR101.) But UC Berkeley's headcount
did not stabilize. It continued to increase and quickly exceeded those projections, with student
enrollment in the 2017-2018 school year reaching 40,955, "exceed[ing] the 2020 LRDP
5 projection by approximately 7,500 students." (AR101.) The record in this action does not

6 include any evidence that UC Berkeley studied the potential effects of the Excess Population

7 before its decision to enroll the additional students who make up the bulk of the increase to its

8 campus population since the 2020 LRDP EIR.

9 Several community members and organizations, including SBN and the City of Berkeley,
10 responded to UC Berkeley's Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Report ("DSEIR") for

11 the Upper Hearst Development by requesting that UC Berkeley separate its "updated baseline"
12| analysis from the analysis of the Upper Hearst Development into a separate EIR. (AR847-848.)

13 Many commenters found the DSEIR confusing and unusual because it combined a future land
14 development project with a seemingly unrelated increase in student population that has already
15 happened. UC Berkeley responded to these comments in its Final Supplemental Environmental
16 Impact Report ("FSEIR"), arguing that an increase in enrollment or population categorically

17 cannot constitute a "project" under CEQA. (AR847, citing Pub. Res. Code § 21080.09.) The

18 FSEIR reasons, it is not possible to produce a meaningful EIR for the population increase

19 because it would not be tethered to an "approval" of a "project." (AR847-848.) The FSEIR also
20 notes that the GSPP project requires a minor amendment to the 2020 LRDP, and that the EIR

21 analysis for that land-use plan would therefore need to be brought up to date. (Ibid.) The FSEIR
22 concluded based on those premises that the Excess Population portion of its updated baseline
23 analysis must be included in the SEIR for the Upper Hearst Development because it could go

24 nowhere else.

25 That conclusion stood on a false premise. UC Berkeley was under the misapprehension
26 that increases in student enrollment only needed to be considered in the context of the long-range

development plan process, and then only to the extent such projections would "assist in
determining the amount of physical development required." (See AR847-878.) In 2018, before
the DSEIR for the Upper Hearst Development was published, Petitioner Save Berkeley's
Neighborhoods sued UC for failing to study the impacts of these increases in enrollment,

5 alleging that the enrollment increases constituted an unstudied project in violation of CEQA.
6 (See Save Berkeley's Neighborhoods v. The Regents of the Univ. of Cal. (2020) 51 Cal.App.5th

7 226, 233.) In June 2020, after the DSEIR and FSEIR were published, the Court of Appeal held

8 that UC Berkeley's interpretation of CEQA was incorrect. "CEQA requires public universities

9 to mitigate the environmental impacts of their growth and development." (Id. at p.231.) "In this

10 context, growth includes student enrollment increases, which the Legislature has acknowledged

11 'may negatively affect the surrounding environment." (lbid.) "[WJhen a public university

12 prepares an EIR for a development plan, [Public Resources Code] section 21080.09 requires

13 universities to expand the analysis to include a related feature of campus growth, future

14 enrollment projections, which is entirely consistent with the traditional, broad definition of a

15 CEQA project." (Id. at p.239.) "It does not say that subsequent changes to enrollment plans-

16 with new or increased environmental effects that have not been analyzed and addressed-are

17 exempt from CEQA." (Ibid.)

18 B. ENROLLMENT - HOW TO REVIEW THE "UPDATED BASELINE"

19 The "updated baseline" is a novel concept under CEQA, and it was included because UC

20 Berkeley misunderstood its legal obligations to study the impacts of student enrollment. Yet the

21 inclusion of an erroneous legal analysis in the SEIR does not necessarily require the EIR
22 certification be set aside. An EIR serves to structure the public consideration of environmental

23 impacts. Courts review an EIR for prejudicial abuse of agency discretion. (Sierra Club, supra, 6

24 Cal.5th at pp.511-512.) But a false legal analysis, like noncompliance with CEQA, is grounds to
25 grant a writ setting aside the agency approval only if the noncompliance resulted in "a

26 subversion of the purposes of CEQA by omitting information from the environmental review

6

l process." (See Schenck v. County of Sonoma (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 949, 959.) In other words,

2 so long as the EIR still correctly identifies, analyzes, discusses alternatives, and proposes
3 mitigation for substantial environmental impacts, it fulfills its public purpose as an informational

4 document, notwithstanding the inclusion of a mistaken legal analysis, and its certification is not

5 an abuse of discretion for that reason. (See Pub. Res. Code § 21168.5 [standard of review is
6 prejudicial abuse of discretion]; Guidelines § 15151 ["The courts have looked not for perfection
7 | but for adequacy, completeness, and a good faith effort at full disclosure."].)

8 The next step would normally be to determine whether UC Berkeley's updated baseline

9 analysis is part of the project being studied. An EIR must study and mitigate the impacts of a

10 "project" and consider reasonable alternatives to that "project." (See Pub. Res. Code § 21002.1

11 ['"The purpose of an environmental impact report is to identify the significant effects on the
12 environment of a project, to identify alternatives to the project, and to indicate the manner in

13 which those significant effects can be mitigated or avoided."]; Guidelines § 15126.2(a) ['"An EIR
14 shall identify and focus on the significant effects of the proposed project on the environment."];

15 see also Guidelines § 15358 [defining "effects" and "impacts" as including only those direct and
16 indirect environmental impacts "caused by the project"].) In their briefs, the parties argued about

17 whether UC Berkeley was estopped from denying that the population increase was part of the

18 "project." At the hearing on the petition, however, the parties stipulated that the SEIR's analysis
19 of the impacts of the increase in enrollment was subject to judicial review in this proceeding
20 without resolving the issue of whether the increases to student enrollment that led to the Excess

21 Population were a part of the project studied in the SEIR. Given this stipulation, the Court does

22 not need to determine whether that past increase was part of the project under study here.

23 But what standard does the Court review the SEIR's analysis of the past increases in
24 student enrollment? CEQA provides only one standard for review for an ElR-the Court will

25 grant the writ if it finds that an agency "has not proceeded in a manner required by law" or its

26 conclusions are "not supported by substantial evidence." (See Pub. Res. Code 21168.5.) The

7

J Court does not decide whether the "updated baseline" analysis or the decision to increase

2 enrollment are a part of the project. But because CEQA provides only one standard of review,

3 this Order reviews the factual determinations and procedural conformity under the same

standards as if they were part of project. The parties' arguments in the briefs regarding
estoppel, waiver, and admission are moot given the parties' stipulation at hearing.

6 C. ENROLLMENT - DESCRIPTION OF THE UPDATED BASELINE

7 Both SBN and the City object to the SEIR on the grounds that it offers an inadequate,
8 shifting description of the project under study as sometimes including the population increase,

9 sometime not. "An accurate, stable, and finite project description is the [s]ine qua non of an

10 informative and legally sufficient EIR," (See County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977)

11 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 193, 199.) An EIR is "fundamentally inadequate and misleading" if it offers

12 "conflicting signals to decision-makers and the public about the nature and scope of the activity

13 being proposed." (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Cir. v. County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th
14 645, 655-656.)

15 The public environmental review process begins with the issuance of a Notice of

16 Preparation ("NOP"). (Pub. Res. Code 21092.) A NOP must provide "sufficient information
17 describing the project and the potential environmental effects to enable the responsible agencies
18 to make a meaningful response." (Guidelines § 15082(a)(1).) In this case, UC Berkeley's NOP
19 describes the "project" as "a public-private partnership that would provide additional academic

20 space for GSPP's undergraduate, graduate, and Global Executive Education programs, and
21 housing geared toward campus affiliates, principally faculty, graduate and post-doctoral

22 students" including "two separate buildings • an academic building and a residential building

23 (AR51, 53.) It also notes that the project "would involve minor text amendments to the

24 2020 LRDP" to "address the fact that the proposed project conflicts with the existing
25 applicable land use plan[] and is not consistent with the 2020 LRDP housing element." (AR52.)
26 The NOP announces that a supplemental EIR, rather than some other kind of informational

8

document, would be prepared because of "changes to the [2020 LRDP] land use plan" and "an

2 increase in current and foreseeable campus population levels above those analyzed in the 2020
LRDP EIR, based on a general increase in student enrollment and employee levels and growing
the GSPP program(s)." (AR52.) The NOP also notes that growing enrollment is part of a
continuing trend, as least in the foreseeable future: "UC Berkeley may continue to expand

6 enrollment", which "depends on various factors including . . . legislative mandates, University
and State of California policies, available resources, and demographic trends" with an estimated

8 growth of "about 1.5 percent annually, on an average, in the near-term." (AR51.) UC Berkeley

9 eventually circulated a Draft SEIR, which described the project as both (1) "the Upper Hearst
10 Development for GSPP" that "would have residential and academic components," and (2) a

11 "Minor LRDP Amendment to accommodate the proposed land uses on the Project site."

12 (AR76.) The evaluation of existing population levels above the levels previously studied were
13 described in the DSEIR not as part of the project but as part of an updated baseline for campus
14 population. (See, e.g., AR60, 64, 848.)

15 The "updated baseline" analysis does not fit well within a traditional CEQA framework.
16 As discussed above, the SEIR itself consistently describes the project under study: the "Upper
17 Hearst Development" involving residential and academic buildings and a minor amendment to

18 the 2020 LRDP's land use plan to allow for that construction, (See, e.g., AR59-60, 69-98, etc.)

19 In its discussion of student enrollment levels, the SEIR distinguishes the impacts of new student
20 enrollment at the Upper Hearst Development from the impacts of the prior and projected

21 enrollment growth not attributable to the GSPP project. Its apparent goal in doing so is to
22 provide an environmental analysis for that previously unstudied population increase sufficient to

23 inform the public without having to study the increase as an actual project.

24 Petitioners argue that the SEIR's use of an "updated baseline" to sometimes discuss and

25 sometimes ignore the Excess Population is analogous to the misleading project descriptions in

26 County of Inyo and City of Santee. (See County of Inyo, supra, 71 Cal.App.3d 185; City of

9

1 Santee V. County of San Diego (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1438.) But it does not present the same

2 problems as an informational document as the EIRs in those cases. In County of Inyo, the City of

3 Los Angeles abused its discretion by certifying an EIR that discussed an increase in ground

4 water pumping from city-owned land in the Owens Valley for in-valley use while failing to
discuss and analyze its vaguely defined "recommended project," a plan to divert surface and
6 groundwater for export to the City of Los Angeles. Los Angeles defined its "project" narrowly

7 while still purporting to disclose and discuss environmental impacts of increased water exports to

8 the City as "not part of the project" because those flows were to be directed through an aqueduct

9 that had been approved before CEQA was enacted-

10 At one point of the Final EIR the contradiction becomes explicit: 'In the process of preparing this environmental impact report, other aspects of

11 Aqueduct System operation have been reevaluated. This includes a reappraisal of the rate of export through the Los Angeles Aqueducts. Thus,
12 the project description presented below includes references to the rate of export, even though the rate of export was not part of the project . , , .'
13 (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 196.)

14 Here, UC Berkeley narrowly described its project as the Upper Hearst Development, but also

15 purports to discuss the environmental impacts of the Excess Population as "not part of the

16 project" because all previous unstudied increases in student enrollment were supposedly exempt

17 from CEQA under UC's misreading of Section 21080.09. Upper Hearst Development includes a
18 small increase in projected student enrollment at the GSPP, but that increase is one part of a

19 continuing trend of increasing student enrollment with potential cumulative effects. But that is

20 not the end of the analysis. Unlike the EIR in County if Inyo, UC Berkeley's SEIR discusses,

21 describes, and considers the impacts of the larger trend in student enrollment in the SEIR.

22 In City of Santee, the Court analyzed a project by the County of San Diego to build a

23 "temporary" jail facility to ease overcrowding in its jail system and analyzed the impacts over

24 seven years. (City of Santee v. County of San Diego (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1438.) The Court
25 emphasized that the County had inappropriately "chopp[ed] a large project into many little ones"

26 because "[n]ot only does a reading of the record support a conclusion that some future action on

10

1 the temporary project was contemplated, it also reflects the EIR here could be considered one
2 small part of the larger project to ease jail crowding in the entire county." (Id. at p.1454.) "Thus

3 it is reasonably foresecable that the project will continue for a longer term than seven years, and
it is likewise reasonably foreseeable that the temporary male detention facility will be moved to
East Mesa either before the end of seven years or at that time." (Ibid.) "These future uses

6 should have been included in the EIR and their cumulative effects discussed." (Ibid.) The SEIR
in this case does consider increase in student enrollment on its own, but it does divorce that
8 analysis from its context in its discussion of the "updated baseline."

9 In short, the SEIR attempts to analyze an increase in student enrollment without
10 admitting that increasing student enrollment is a project subject to review. The SEIR describes
11 the Upper Hearst Development as the relevant project. That project description does not shift

12 from one part of the SEIR to another. The SEIR situates that project within its larger context of

13 increasing student enrollment and it discusses cumulative effects. The SEIR's definition is clear

14 enough that reasonable members of the public would not be misled about the scope of the project

15 under review, and it is not SO "curtailed, enigmatic or unstable" that it "draws a red herring
16| across the path of public input." (County of Inyo, supra, 71 Cal.App.3d at p.198.)

17 D. ENROLLMENT -IMPACTS FROM GROWING CAMPUS POPULATION

18 l. Induced Housing Demand and Population Growth

19 The CEQA Guidelines mandate that a lead agency should consider impacts to population
20 and housing when analyzing a project. (Guidelines § 15126.2(a), (e) [EIR must discuss "changes

21 induced in population distribution" "population concentration" and must "[d]iscuss the ways in

22 which the proposed project could foster economic of population growth, or the construction of
23 additional housing, either directly or indirectly, in the surrounding environment."].) The

24 Guidelines' Environmental Checklist Form asks the lead agency to determine whether the project

25 (a) would "[i]nduce substantial unplanned growth in an area, either directly (for example, by
26 proposing new homes and businesses) or indirectly (for example, through extensions of roads or

11

1 other infrastructure)" or (b) would "[d]isplace substantial numbers of existing people or housing,

2 necessitating the construction of replacement housing elsewhere." (Guidelines, appx. G, § XIV,

3 subds. (a), (b).)
UC Berkeley's DSEIR identified population and housing as an arca in which further
analysis was required. (AR206.) It projected that student enrollment at UC Berkeley in the

6 2022-2023 academic year would exceed the projections in the 2020 LRDP EIR by more than a

7 third, but employees (and members of their households) were under projections. (AR207.) The

8 DSEIR attributes this increase to an increase in California's college-age population and the

9 state's Master Plan for Higher Education. (AR207.) The DSEIR "assume[s] that most of the

10 additional campus population would live in Berkeley or nearby parts of the Bay Area. (AR207.)

11 It compares the net population increase a projected increase to population for the entire
12 metropolitan Bay Area and concludes that its increased campus population would not
13 substantially affect the region as a whole. (AR207.) The DSEIR also noted that UC Berkeley

14 had created only 1,119 of the 2,600 new student beds authorized or anticipated in the 2020

15 LRDP EIR, and that UC Berkeley therefore had excess capacity to accommodate additional

16 student housing to offset any impacts. (AR208.) The DSEIR did not analyze effects on the

17 housing market, reasoning that such impacts were "not in themselves environmental impacts."

18 (AR208.) It concluded that the increase in population "would generally be accommodated

19 without significant adverse impacts" and would not result in new impacts beyond those studied

20 by the 2020 LRDP EIR. (AR208.)

21 The City of Berkeley submitted comments disputing this analysis. The City argued that

22 the DSEIR's comparison to the entire Bay Area was inappropriate because "new students,
23 faculty, and staff would be drawn to living in Berkeley due to the city's proximity to campus and

24 the campus' location in the heart of the City" but that the net increase of roughly 11,000 students

25 is approximately nine percent of the City's population. (AR1186.) The City also referenced a
26 2017 survey conducted by UC Berkeley's chancellor's office showing that demand for campus

12

1 housing at UC Berkeley outpaces supply and that UC Berkeley has the lowest percentage of beds

2 to its student body of any UC campus in the state. (AR1185.) The same report found that ten
3  percent of students had experienced homelessness while attending UC Berkeley, including 20
4  percent of doctoral students. (AR1185.) The City asserted that this increase in population

5 without an increase in on-campus housing had led to "increased pressure for development in the

6 City" as evidenced by a "marked increase in development applications over prior years
| particularly for the development of multi-unit housing developments typically marketed to
8 students." (AR1186.) These new buildings, the City argued--when combined with UC
9 Berkeley's practice of master-leasing off-campus apartments for student housing-reduce the

10 housing available for non-student residents and displace existing residents, particularly in
11 historically lower-income neighborhoods in South Berkeley and West Berkeley. (AR1186.) The

12 City also argues the imbalance between rapidly increased student enrollment with little

13 additional student housing development exacerbated student and nonstudent homelessness and

14 caused additional significant environmental impacts, including physical impacts to parks, streets,

15 and public places and increased demand for public safety and public health services due to the
16 unsafe living conditions in homeless encampments. (AR1187.) The City faulted the DSEIR for

17 not considering these indirect impacts from development, displacement, and homelessness.

18 As part of the Southside Neighborhood Consortium ("SNC"), SBN also submitted
19 comments on the topic of housing and population. (See AR1656 [Southside Neighborhood
20 Consortium letter signed by Philip Bokovoy on behalf of SBN].) Like the City, SNC objected

21 that population impacts were compared to population growth in entire Bay Area, not just
22 Berkeley. (AR1654.) It argued that the increased student population causes "pressure on the

23 local housing market with higher rents and more displacement" and increased "gentrification."

24 (AR1655.) SNC also argued that the increased student population will increase demands for
25 City services-including police protection, fire and emergency medical services, parks and open
26 space-more late-night noise and traffic and more incidences of improper refuse disposal and

13

"moving day trash." (AR1655.) Finally, SNC also argued that the DSEIR's conclusion that the

2 fact that the City "already accommodates" a large number of student residents "is the equivalent
of saying: 'students over the baseline are already here so there is no impact." (AR1656.)

4 UC Berkeley responded to these comments in the FSEIR, which reports that

5 approximately 65% of UC Berkeley students live on campus or within a mile of campus.

6 (AR845.) This statistic does not support the university's comparison of the increase in campus
7 population to population growth in the greater Bay Area rather than the local area in which the

8 majority of its students reside. The FSEIR also finds that the total increase of 11,285 students by

9 the end of the 2022-2023 academic year (that is, both the Excess Population and the projected
10 increase from the Upper Hearst Development) would exceed the projected growth in UC

11 Berkeley-provided housing. (AR846.) It concludes that the University's 2020 LRDP planned

12 for a substantial increase in student housing that has not yet been built: "After construction of up

13 to 150 housing units in the proposed Upper Hearst Development, substantial capacity for

14 additional student housing would remain under the 2020 LRDP," and Development of additional,

15 affordable student housing "is consistent with the 2020 LRDP's development plans." (AR855.)
16 The FSEIR does not analyze whether exceeding the 2020 LRDP student enrollment projections

17 had indirect environmental impacts that were exacerbated leaving significant amounts of planned

18 student housing undeveloped.

19 The FSEIR's responded in part to the City's comments by noting that concerns about
20 increased campus population are about the "updated baseline,' not the proposed Upper Hearst
21| Development. (See AR1185 [City's concern regarding impacts of "substantial increase in

22 campus population"]; AR882 [FSEIR's response].) The FSEIR concluded that no response was
23 | required because the "updated baseline" was not the project under consideration: "[T]he student
24 population has now increased beyond 2020 LRDP projections with little or no analysis of the

25 potential environmental impacts of this increase in students over the number analyzed in the

26 2020 LRDP EIR." (AR882.) "CEQA [only] requires that UC Berkeley compare the potential

14

1 impacts of the housing project, such as the Upper Hearst Development, with existing

2 environmental conditions at the time CEQA review occurs, including current campus

3 I population." (AR882.) "Review of population increases are typically done as part of an overall

4 LRDP and its EIR." (AR882.) Here, the SEIR dismisses the displacement and indirect

5 population impacts of the "update" portion of the updated baseline as outside the scope of its

6 study, The Court cannot meaningfully review the SEIR's analysis of population impacts when

7 the SEIR declines to reach those conclusions itself in the first place. If the "update" were a

8 project, UC Berkeley's refusal to consider potentially significant environmental impacts would

9 be a prejudicial abuse of discretion, and the Court finds it to be so here. This abuse of discretion
10 is exacerbated because the analysis does not clearly address the impact of the future student
li enrollment increase attributed to the "project."

12 The FSEIR responds to the City and SNC's concerns about student and induced

13 nonstudent homelessness by asserting that "CEQA was enacted to protect the environment and
14 speculation about increased housing insecurity is beyond its scope." (AR883.) "The potential

15 displacement of existing tenants in Berkeley also could result in an incremental increase in the
16 population of homeless people living in Berkeley, although the social impacts of displacement
17 are beyond the scope of environmental review under CEQA." (AR856.) In the FSEIR, UC

18 Berkeley also argues that it need it not consider the impacts of induced demand for non-University

19 housing because another agency will consider the environmental impacts of individual
20 development projects induced by economic forces. "Greater housing demand would increase the

21 incentive to construct additional private housing that caters to UC Berkeley students." (AR856.)

22 "If future projects are proposed that would require the displacement of substantial numbers of
23 people or existing housing, necessitating the construction of replacement housing elsewhere,
24 their environmental impacts would be evaluated as required by CEQA on a project-specific
25 basis." (AR856, citing AR2535 [2020 LRDP Vol. at p.4.10-10].) This analysis fails to
26 consider whether its past increase in student enrollment caused population displacement.

15

Increases in campus population foreseeably lead to direct and indirect impacts on housing,

2 population, and displacement, and the failure to consider those impacts constitutes a prejudicial
abuse of discretion.
The FSEIR concludes that no new displacement impacts would result from the

5 construction of new University housing. "The proposed increase in headcount also may

6 necessitate the construction of new UC Berkeley-provided housing; however, such construction

7 would not require substantial displacements because the 2020 LRDP's land use strategy

8 prioritizes the siting of new housing on UC Berkeley's current property and, where necessary,

9 acquiring other sites where the displacement of existing tenants can be minimized." (AR856.)
10 This portion of the analysis also fails to consider indirect displacement impacts.

11 2. Demand for Public Services by Excess Population

12 The City argues that UC Berkeley erred in considering the population impacts by
13 concluding, without substantial evidence, that the increased population would not substantially

14 increase the demand for public services. The Guidelines require a lead agency to consider "other

15 aspects of the resource base such as . public services." (Guidelines § 15126.2(a).) The

16 Environmental Checklist Form asks the lead agency to determine whether the project would

17 "result in substantial adverse physical impacts associated with the provision of new or physically

18 altered government facilities, the construction of which would cause significant environmental
19 impacts, in order to maintain acceptable service ratios, response times or other performance
20 objectives" for various public services. (Guidelines, appx. G, § XV.) In response to the Draft 21 SEIR, the City of Berkeley submitted comments and evidence arguing that the increase in
22 student enrollment had created a significant increase in police services, fire and emergency

23 medical services, and public health services. (AR1187-1193.)

24 The City offered UC Berkeley a report by Economic and Planning Systems, Inc. (the
25 "EPS Report") as part of its public comments on the project. (AR1221-1309.) The EPS Report
on the City of being home to UC Berkeley. The Report states 26 broadly analyzes the fiscal impact

16

1 that calls for police service from UC Berkeley and its immediate surroundings increased from 14
2 percent to 19 percent of the citywide total from 2003 to 2018. (AR1223.) The EPS Report also
3 states that, although UC Berkeley has its own code enforcement and fire inspection personnel, it
4 does not maintain its own fire and emergency medical response teams and, as a result, the City's

5 fire department provides the vast majority of fire and emergency medical response protection for

6 UC Berkeley's campus. (AR1223.) It also states that the City's fire department must undertake
7 special training because of high-density buildings (e.g., student dormitories) and specialized

8 buildings with dangerous contents (e.g., laboratories). (AR1189; see also AR6128 ["UC

9 Berkeley relies on local public safety agencies to provide medical, fire, and emergency response" but
10 provides information about "hazardous materials [responders] may encounter and how to deal with

11 them ...."].) The EPS Report also notes that increased enrollment has increased demand for the

12 City's public health services. (AR1191.)

13 In the FSEIR, UC Berkeley reasoned that staffing and equipment purchases are "fiscal
14 matters," whereas "CEQA analysis .. . focuses on environmental impacts that could result from
15 construction of new facilities that are required to provide fire department services." (AR846; see

16 also AR877 at Response A 8.4 ["As to comments related to how increased student population
17 places additional burdens on already overtaxed city services, while a this is a matter of concern,

18 under CEQA, staffing and support needs for public services are relevant only to the extent that
19 | they result in physical changes that have environmental impacts."].) Regarding fire department
20 response times, UC stated that it would continue to abide by "Continuing Best Practice PUB-2.3"
21 from the 2020 LRDP EIR: to "continue [its] partnership with [Lawrence Berkeley National
22 Laboratory], [Alameda County Fire Department], and the City of Berkeley to ensure adequate

23 fire and emergency service levels to the campus and UC facilities," including "consultation on
24  the adequacy of emergency access routes to all new University Buildings." (AR847.) The

25 FSEIR did not expressly mention public health services in its response. (See AR884.)

26 Importantly, the FSEIR based its conclusion on an absence of evidence produced by the City. It

17

J found that its analysis in the DSEIR was adequate because "[the City] did not provide
2 information or analysis to suggest that new or physically altered fire protection facilities, the

3 construction of which could cause significant environmental impacts, would be required as a

4 result of the proposed project or increased headcount." (AR884, at Response 8.22.)
The City did, in fact, provide information indicating that increased service calls "will

6 result in a need for additional personnel and new facilities to accommodate them." (AR1190.)
After UC Berkeley released the Final SEIR, the City submitted additional evidence of physical

8 impacts. (See SAR239 [letter from City to UC Board of Regents dated May 13, 2019].) The

9 City identified its current plans for a new fire station in South Berkeley, a new ambulance it
10 already purchased, and its pressing need for larger space for its 911 emergency response call

11 center. (SAR249, SAR340.) The same letter argues that, because Berkeley police spend an
12 increasing proportion of their time responding to an increasing number of student calls, their
13 activities necessarily result in increased air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and traffic.
14(SAR248.) The Court found no substantial contradictory evidence that might show that the

15 increased demand on City of Berkeley services caused by from the Excess Population has not
16 contributed to the City's plans or purchase of new facilities with an impact on the environment,

17 and the SEIR does not cite or discuss any. The Court finds that it was a prejudicial abuse of

18 discretion to certify the SEIR on the basis of this inadequate analysis.

19 3. Noise and Aesthetic Impacts from Excess Population

20 The DSEIR noted that "additional student enrollment could indirectly result in an

21 increase in student rentals of private off-campus housing in Berkeley's residential
22 neighborhoods," which might result in "incrementally greater noise generated from existing
23 | sources such as human conversations on sidewalks and residential yards, especially during social
24 gatherings." (AR208.) It dismissed this concern because the "increased headcount would not
25 introduce new sources of noise that may disturb residents, since neighborhoods near UC
26 Berkeley already accommodate a high proportion of off-campus student rentals." (AR208.)

18

1 "Continued implementation of the Berkeley Noise Ordinance would also minimize exposure to

2 high noise levels generated on properties in the city." (AR208.) "Therefore, the Project,
3 accounting for the updated campus headcount projections, would not result in significant indirect

4 environmental impacts in off-campus neighborhoods." (AR208.)
Residents living near campus expressed concern with this analysis. SNC commented that

6 the DSEIR did not consider evidence of the noise impacts of increasing student enrollment by
11,285 students who live primarily in off-campus private housing. (AR1653-1654.) Groups of

8 students living off campus are associated with "increases in noise, late-night traffic, and

9 improper refuse disposal." (AR1654.) Individual commenters also expressed this concern: "The
10 increase in traffic (and in aggressive driving), difficulties in parking, increase in noise from

11 groups of students, and increase in improperly discarded trash and street dumping are only a few

12 of the changes I have seen." (AR1837.) "[MJini-dorms frequently generate extreme party noise,

13 often into the wee hours of morning," but "calling the police when one is kept awake by party

14 noise is often useless, as they are too busy to go to each screaming party." (AR1861.)

15 Commenters attached pictures of improperly disposed refuse on "move-out day." (AR1865.)

16 The FSEIR repeated assertions from the DSEIR. "[A]dditional student enrollment could
17  result in an increase in student rentals of private off-campus housing in Berkeley's residential

18 neighborhoods." (AR845.) "However, increased headcount would not introduce new sources of
19 noise that may disturb residents, since neighborhoods near UC Berkeley already accommodate a
20 high proportion of off-campus student rentals." (AR845, emphasis added.) The FSEIR reasons
21 that neighborhoods near campus currently accommodate large numbers of students. This
22 analysis is an abuse of discretion. The FSEIR compares the its current student enrollment
23 numbers to the present, post-increase status quo and concludes that the increased in student

24 enrollment will not have any effects. That is, the SEIR fails to compare its increased enrollment

25 to a baseline before the increase. In this, the SEIR fails in its own stated goal of studying the
26 impacts of its earlier increases in student enrollment. The Court also cannot find substantial

19

1 evidence in the record supporting FSEIR's conclusion that a further marginal increase in student
2 | enrollment would not exacerbate noise issues or have cumulative impacts.

3 The FSEIR also concludes that other factors will offset or mitigate any noise impacts
from increased student enrollment. "Continued implementation of the Berkeley Noise Ordinance

5 would also minimize exposure to high noise levels generated on properties in the city."

6 (AR845.) "Good neighbor relations programs and activities established by the [sic] UC

7 Berkeley, like Happy Neighbors, which educates students and their neighbors about community

8 expectations and relevant policies and laws, will also help to minimize exposure to high noise

9 to no evidence on which it based a conclusion that these levels." (AR846.) The SEIR refers

10 programs reduce the impact of the increase in students residing off-campus in private housing on

11 community noise levels, much less a finding that, if there were a noise impact, these programs

12 effectively reduce the impact to insignificance. The SEIR does not propose that UC adopt these

13 programs as mitigation measures to minimize the ongoing impact of its increased student

14 enrollment levels.

15 In response to community comments regarding moving-day trash, the FSEIR also asserts

16 that "[s]poradic littering does not rise to the level of a significant aesthetic impact under CEQA."
17|| (AR846, 911, 1055.) It also similarly references university programs meant to mitigate the
18 impact: "Other issues, such as the visual effect of littering caused by students living off-campus,

19 are also addressed through programs such as Cal Move [I]n and Move Out, which is a program
20 established to decrease the environmental and social impacts of illegal dumping in near-campus
21 neighborhoods at the start and end of the academic year, and to educate students about

22 responsible disposal and reuse strategies." (AR846.) A "significant effect on the environment"

23 is "a substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in any of the physical conditions

24 within the area affected by the project... (Guidelines § 15382.) Under the substantial

25 evidence standard, UC Berkeley could reasonably conclude, based on the reported once-a-year
was not a "substantial" effect on the environment. 26 nature of this problem, that it

20

1 4. Reasonable Alternatives

2 The City of Berkeley and SBN both fault UC Berkeley for not considering a "reduced
enrollment" alternative in the SEIR. Normally, a lead agency must "describe feasible measures
which could minimize significant adverse impacts" and "describe a range of reasonable

5 alternatives to the project, or to the location of the project, which would feasibly attain most of
the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant

7 effects of the project, and evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives." (Guidelines

8 15126.4(a)(1), § 15126.6(a).) UC Berkeley argues that increased student enrollment was

9 already part of the baseline, but even if it was considered, the SEIR found the increase had no
10 significant impacts from the this excess population. Thus discussion of a reduced enrollment

11 alternative would have been superfluous. Because the court concludes that the environmental
12 analysis was flawed, however, this court cannot endorse UC Berkeley's conclusion that the lack

13 of analysis of a reduced enrollment alternative is legally permissible. Moreover, UC Berkeley's
14 argument does not address the future impact of increased enrollment due to the "project."

15 III. UPPER HEARST DEVELOPMENT - IMPACTS ON HISTORIC RESOURCES

16 SBN and the City both argue that UC Berkeley failed to properly define the historical

17 context of the new buildings on Hearst and performs an incomplete analysis of the impact of the
18  project on the historical buildings in the surrounding neighborhood. SBN also argues that the
19 University's mitigation measure improperly defers mitigation for significant historical impacts.

20 The DSEIR identified four buildings as historical resources near the Upper Hearst

21 Development site, relying on the 2020 LRDP EIR and the California Office of Historic

22 Resources Inventory. (AR134 [identifying the Beta Theta Pi House, Cloyne Court, Founder's

23 Rock, and Phi K Psi].) The 2020 LRDP EIR in turn drew its list of historic resources from "the

24 National Register of Historic Places, the State Historic Resources Inventory (State Inventory)

25 compiled by the Northwest Information Center at Sonoma State University, the Physical and

26 Environmental Planning unit in Facilities Services at UC Berkeley, and registers of the cities of

21

1 Berkeley and Oakland." (AR2312; AR2316 [describing Berkeley landmark ordinance]; see also

2 AR2324-2325 [listing designated buildings in the adjacent blocks north of campus]. The DSEIR

3 discussed the historical context of the First Bay Tradition, a style of architecture represented by
4 numerous buildings in Daley's Scenic Park (also called Daley's Scenic Tract), near the Upper
5 Hearst Development site. (AR131-140.) The DSEIR found that the Upper Hearst Development
project would require the demolition of a parking structure, which UC Berkeley had determined
not to be a historical resource. (AR147.) The Upper Hearst Development would also require the

8 demolition and replacement of "most of the primary site design of the Beta Theta Pi house"

9 including removal of 32 feet of a stream-rock training wall and numerous landscaping features.

10 |(AR147-148.) The Upper Hearst Development would also "envelop [the Beta Theta Pi house]

11 within the site plan of the adjacent academic building, which bears little resemblance to the

12 historic property in terms of materials, design, scale/mass, and setting." (AR148.) Additionally,

13 the "scale, mass, and architectural design/materials of the new buildings" would not be

14 "compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features" of the Beta Theta Pi house,

15 Cloyne Court, or Phi Kappa Psi because "the new buildings would be significantly higher and of
16 greater mass and scale than all buildings in the immediate vicinity." (AR149.)

17 The DSEIR concluded that the Upper Hearst Development would "impair the integrity of

18 two historical resources identified in the 2020 LRDP" and "would impair the integrity of a third

19 immediately north of the Project site." (AR150.) It proposed a mitigation measure

20 (designated "MM-CUL-1") requiring that, "[p]rior to approval of final design plans for the

21 Upper Hearst Development, UC Berkeley shall retain a historic architect meeting the National
22 Park Service Professional Qualification Standards for historic architecture to review plans for the
23 proposed academic and residential buildings" who would "provide input and refinements to the

24 design team regarding modifications to the palette of exterior materials to improve compatibility
25 with neighboring historical resources and compliance with" national standards. (AR150.) The

26 DSEIR found that the Upper Hearst Development would "degrade the integrity of feeling and

22

setting of historical resources adjacent to the Project site" as a "significant and unavoidable

2 cumulative impact on historical resources" and that MM-CUL-1 would "reduce this impact to
the extent feasible." (AR150.)
Several public commenters expressed concern about the DSEIR's description of the
Upper Hearst Development's historical context. (E.g., AR1206 [City of Berkeley]; AR1150-
1151 [Berkeley Landmark Preservation Commission]; AR1634-1639 [Berkeley Architectural
7 Heritage Association].) One particularly thorough letter from the Berkeley Architectural

8 Heritage Association ("BAHA") identified an additional 25 buildings in the neighboring
9 blocks--eleven of them designated landmarks by the City of Berkeley Landmark Preservation
10 Commission. (AR1638-1639.) It also argued that the DSEIR analysis did not recognize Daley's

I1 Scenic Park as an independently significant historical resource. (AR1634, 1639.) The eleven

12 listed buildings are "presumptive" historic resources because they are listed on a local historic

13 registry. (AR1638-1639; see Pub. Res. Code § 21084.1; Guidelines § 15064.5(a)(2).) One
14 building, the Phi Delta Theta chapter house, is listed on the is National Register of Historic Places.
15 (AR1638.) The other buildings (and Daley's Scenic Park as an area) may constitute historical

16 resources, subject to the discretion of UC Berkeley, based on the evidence. (See Guidelines

17 § 15064.5(a)(3) ['"Any . . . building, structure, site, area, [or] place .. . which lead agency

18 determines to be historically significant ... may be considered to be an historical resource,
19 provided the lead agency's determination is supported by substantial evidence in light of the

20 whole record."].)

21 The FSEIR responded to comments by noting that the Upper Hearst Development is not

22 situated in a designated historic district (AR897) and that the DSEIR "is not intended as a

23 comprehensive survey or original scholarship on the history of the project site and its
24 surroundings." (AR862.) The FSEIR noted that many of the buildings that BAHA identified are
25 located several blocks from the project site and that, "[i]n keeping with standard CEQA and
26 professional practice," the DSEIR analyzed the potential impacts on historical resources located

23

I within or directly adjacent to the project site. (AR898.) The FSEIR notes that, although the

2 remaining buildings were not discussed in the DSEIR by name, they are part of the historical

3 context and of the nearby neighborhood, which was discussed in some detail. (AR898; see

4 AR131-140.)
In its follow-up letter to the FSEIR, the City of Berkeley communicated a concern that

6 MM-CUL-1 was an inadequate mitigation measure because it did not reduce the severity of the

7 impact to a "less than significant" level. (SAR257.) The City also objected that it "relegates the
8 input of a historical architect to the status of unenforceable best practices, and delays this input

9 until a later unspecified date" because it "would merely result in recommendations for exterior
10 || building materials that would be forwarded to University decision-makers to 'consider,' without

11 any demonstrable enforceability to avoid or reduce the severity of the impact." (SAR257-258.)

12 The City argued that "[t]he deferred input of an historical architect on future proposed redesigns

13 following CEQA review fails to avoid or substantially reduce this impact," which, "contrary to

14 the University's assertions, . . . is not unavoidable." (SAR259.)

15 In its findings acopting the SEIR and approving the project, the University found that the

16 Upper Hearst Development would "degrade the integrity of feeling and setting of historical
17 resources adjacent to the Project site, which will contribute to a significant and unavoidable

18 cumulative impact on historical resources" and that adopting MM-CUL-1 was feasible and

19 would "reduce this impact to the extent feasible." (AR24-25.) It also found that, "even with
20 implementation of this measure, significant unavoidable impacts [would] occur" and that

21 "specific economic, legal, social, technological, or other considerations make it infeasible to
22 reduce this impact to a less than significant level." (AR25.)

23 The DSEIR's inventory of four potentially affected buildings as historical resources is

24 supported by substantial evidence, the inventories consulted for the DSEIR and the 2020 LRDP

25 EIR. (See AR862 [describing "due diligence" steps taken, including site visits, records research,

26 and experts consulted]; see also AR130, 141-145.) The DSEIR also discusses the major

24

historical events and aesthetic and architectural features that give the area north of campus its

2 historical context and value and feeling. In so doing it describes the historical environmental

3 setting of the surrounding area, including the First Bay Tradition and the structures that survived

4 1923 Berkeley Fire.

5 UC Berkeley's decision to exclude the buildings on BAHA's list from consideration is

6 also not an abuse of discretion. The resources in the list may qualify as "historical resources."

7 (See Guidelines § 15064.5(a)(1)-(4).) But CEQA only requires a lead agency to consider as an

8 impact a "substantial adverse change in the significance of an historical resource." (Guidelines

9 15064.5(b).) A "substantial adverse change in [] significance" means "physical demolition,

10 destruction, relocation, or alteration of the resource or its immediate surroundings such that the

11 significance of an historical resource would be materially impaired." (Guidelines

12 § 15064.5(b)(1).) The City and SBN argue that the Upper Hearst Development might "alter[)"

13 the "immediate surroundings" of the additional historical resources identified by BAHA and that

14 UC Berkeley abused its discretion by failing to consider the project's potential impacts on those

15 buildings. The unconsidered buildings are as close as a block away to several blocks away.

16 UC Berkeley did not abuse its discretion in determining that buildings in the "immediate

17 vicinity" of the project site means buildings within the project side or immediately adjacent to

18 it-that is, buildings across the street were included; those a block away were not. The type of
19 | impact being discussed here (a mismatch of scale and architectural style) may affect the
20 historical feel of a building, but proposed plans and the description of the environmental setting

21 are substantial evidence from which a reasonable person could conclude that the impact of the

22 project would be insignificant for all but the closest buildings. There is no evidence that the

23 addition of a new building would have a material impact on the historical significance of the
24 nearby historical structures. (Cf. Taxpayers for Accountable School Bond Spending v. San Diego

25 Unified School Dist. (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1013, 1045 [finding no abuse of discretion when

26

25

1 school district failed to consider impact of increased field lighting from new football stadium on
2 / historical significance of nearby neighborhood].)

3 UC Berkeley's decision not to consider Daley's Scenic Tract as a historical district is also
not an abuse of discretion. The FSEIR found by substantial evidence that Daley's Scenic Tract

5 is not listed in a national, state, or local historic register. It is therefore not a "mandatory" or

6 "presumptive" historical resource. (See Pub. Res. Code § 21084.1; Guidelines § 15064.5(a)(1),

7 (2); see also Valley Advocates v. City of Fresno (2008) 160 Cal.App.4th 1039, 1051 [discussing
8 "mandatory,""presumptive," and "discretionary" as common labels for three categories of

9 treatment for historical resources under CEQA].) SBN argues that UC Berkeley abused its

10 discretion by failing to consider whether Daley's Scenic Tract constitutes a discretionary
11 | historical resource. SBN analogizes this to the Valley Advocates case, arguing that the Court

12 should grant the writ because UC Berkeley "did not, in fact, exercise its discretion" to determine

13 whether Daley's Scenic Tract is a historical resource. (Valley Advocates v. City of Fresno (2008)

14 160 Cal.App. 4th 1039, 1061.) In that case, however, "the City Council [of Fresno] was
15 misinformed about its discretion" because it had previously denied an application for historical

16 recognition for the same building. (Id. at p.1061.) And although the SEIR does not expressly
17 consider the regulatory factors for weighing whether a resource could, in UC's discretion, be

18 considered a historical resource, there is no indication that UC Berkeley was under a

19 misapprehension of its ability to do so here. Instead, it appears to have been aware of the history

20 and significance of the scattering of First Bay Tradition homes surviving in Daley's Scenic

21 Tract. (See, e.g., AR134-135, 862, 897.) The SEIR discussed the importance of the
22  neighborhood as context but did not find the area itself to be a historical resource independent of

23 the collection of historical buildings within it.

24 SBN argues that mitigation measure MM-CUL-1 improperly defers mitigation because it

25 only requires that the architect "provide input and refinements" but no actual requirements. The

26 DSEIR proposed, and UC Berkeley adopted, MM-CUL-1, which provides as follows:

26

Prior to approval of final design plans for the Upper Hearst Development, UC Berkeley shall retain a historic architect meeting the National Park
2 Service Professional Qualifications Standards for historic architecture to

3 review plans for the proposed academic and residential buildings. The historic architect shall provide input and refinements to the design team
4 regarding modifications to the palette of exterior materials to improve compatibility with neighboring historical resources and compliance with the

5 Secretary of Interior's Standards. This review shall include, but not be limited to, suggestions for incorporating exterior materials, such as wood or
6 brick, in the design. (AR150.)

7 UC Berkeley argues that its adoption of MM-CUL-1 should not be judged against the usual

8 standards for mitigation measures because it does not purport to reduce the impact to a "less than

9 significant" level. (Resps.' Opp. to Petr. SBN's Opening Merits Brief, at p.35 [citing AR150];

10 see also AR25 [findings of significant and unavoidable impact]; AR2367 [2020 LRDP EIR ] .)

11 This argument is contrary to the text and policy underlying CEQA: "Each public agency shall
12 mitigate or avoid the significant effects on the environment of projects that it carries out Or

13 approves whenever it is feasible to do so." (Pub. Res. Code § 21002.1; see also Pub. Res. Code

14 § 21002 ["[I]t is the policy of the state that public agencies should not approve projects as

15 proposed if there are feasible alternatives or feasible mitigation measures available which would

16 substantially lessen the significant environmental effects of such projects."].) Even if a lead

17 agency finds that environmental impacts would remain significant, it still must adopt feasible
18 measures to mitigate or avoid those impacts.

19 That said, UC Berkeley did not abuse its discretion by adopting MM-CUL-1. UC
20 Berkeley argues that it is not deferring mitigation because MM-CUL-1 requires it to take specific

21 steps, because those steps are to be guided by the Secretary of the Interior's standards, and

22 because mitigation to historical impacts is inherently subjective and does not lend itself to
23 objective criteria. As the term is used in CEQA, "[m]itigation' includes: [1I (a) Avoiding the
24 impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action[; and] [1] (b) [mJinimizing
25| impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation .. . ."
26| (Guidelines § 15370.) To ensure that mitigation measures are adequate, an "EIR shall describe

27

feasible measures which could minimize significant adverse impacts." (Guidelines
2 || § 15126.4.(a)(1).) "Formulation of mitigation measures shall not be deferred until some future

3 time." (Guidelines § 15126.4(a)(1)(B).) "The specific details of a mitigation measure, however,
4 may be developed after project approval when it is impractical or infeasible to include those
details during the project's environmental review provided that the agency (1) commits itself to

6 the mitigation, (2) adopts specific performance standards the mitigation will achieve, and (3)
7 identifies the type(s) of potential action(s) that can feasibly achieve that performance standard

8 and that will considered, analyzed, and potentially incorporated in the mitigation measure."

9 (Ibid.) UC Berkeley's adopted mitigation measure MM-CUL-1 meets these standards because it

10 commits the University to hiring t qualified historical architect, because it requires the
11 | University to adopt the Secretary of Interior's Standards as a performance standard (see

12 Guidelines §15064.5(b)(3)), and because it identifies changes to exterior materials as the kinds of

13 changes that will be considered and potentially incorporated in the mitigation measure.

14 UC Berkeley also did not abuse its discretion by concluding that the Upper Hearst

15 Development's impact on the historical resources would be significant and unavoidable and that
16 the benefits of the project outweigh the historical impacts. (See AR25, 40.) SBN argues that UC
17 Berkeley abused its discretion by rejecting reduced scale alternative. (AR38.) UC's factual

18 findings included a finding that:

19 The Reduced Scale Alternative would meet most of the Project objectives, but to a lesser extent than would the Project. The Alternative would better
20 meet objectives to maintain the character and setting of surrounding historic

21 buildings and to build facilities that are compatible with the surrounding neighborhood. However, by reducing the scale of the new GSPP, the

22 Alternative would not fully meet objectives related to fulfilling the academic needs of the School's program. Similarly, because the residential

23 building includes fewer residential units than proposed, the alternative would not fully meet objectives to provide housing on-site to serve current
24 market demand and to address the shortage of campus housing. By
reducing the scale of development, the Alternative would meet the objective
25 of accommodating increased School enrollment to a lesser extent than

26 would the Project. The potential removal of additional parking spaces also would not meet the objective of maintaining as much parking as possible

28

1 on-site. Because the Reduced Scale Alternative would meet Project

2 objectives to a lesser a extent than would the Project, the University rejects this alternative. (AR38.)
3 SBN argues that UC Berkeley did not actually find that the reduced scale alternative was

4 infeasible. UC Berkeley's findings noted that a reduced scale alternative would lessen some

5 impacts but exacerbate others. (See also AR251-254 [discussion in DSEIR reaching same
6 conclusion].) Substantial evidence supports the university's decision that the environmental

7 benefits of the reduced scale alternative were outweighed by its downsides and that it is

8 infeasible to reduce that impact to a less-than-significant level. (AR24-25.)
IV. UPPER HEARST DEVELOPMENT -TRAFFIC AND NOISE IMPACTS

10 The City also argues that the SEIR's analysis of the Upper Hearst Development failed to
i1 adequately analyze potential traffic and noise impacts. The City objected to the DSEIR's traffic
12 analysis, arguing that the DSEIR assumed without evidence that reducing existing parking at the

13 Upper Hearst Development site would reduce trip generation rather than shift parking demand
14 elsewhere. (See AR1194.) Responding to the City's comment, the FSEIR justified its reliance

15 on indirect measures of trip generation because alternatives to university parking, such as street
16 parking and off-campus parking lots, are open to the public and University-affiliated parking
17 cannot be isolated from general public parking at those locations, so direct observation of trip
18 generation is infeasible. (AR884-885.) Instead the FSEIR, like the 2020 LRDP EIR from which
19 it tiers, relies on indirect data, such as survey data, intersection traffic data, on-campus parking
20 permits and parking lot occupancy rates. (AR885.) "[T]he UC Berkeley-operated parking
21 supply decreased by about 1,130 spaces (about 15 percent) from 2001-2002 to 2016-2017, and

22 during the same period, the drive-alone mode share for all population groups, as well as Campus
23 Park trip generation, decreased." (AR885.) The data behind these statements are substantial

24 evidence from which a reasonable agency could conclude that a marginal decrease in parking
25 availability will marginally decrease car commutes by inducing more students, faculty, and staff
26

29

to commute by public transportation, bicycle, or foot. This conclusion was not an abuse of

2 discretion.

3 The City also argues that the SEIR failed to consider traffic impacts related to

4 construction of the Upper Hearst Development. (See AR1195.) It did, however, consider those

5 impacts, and it concluded that they "would be less than significant and no mitigation is therefore
6 required." (AR879.) The City argues that the SEIR's continuing best practices, which were

7 adopted from the 2020 LRDP EIR, "do not include, as they should, City review and approval of

8 the Construction Traffic Management Plans." (AR1195.) The SEIR expressly adopted

9 continuing best practices from the 2020 LRDP EIR, which mandate that the university require

10 contractors to prepare of a construction traffic management plan early in the planning process-
11 including proposed truck routes, construction hours, employee parking, and equipment staging-
12 and schedule projects to minimize overlap between excavation and other truck-heavy portions of
13 construction projects. (AR879, 886 [responding to City's comment at AR1195]; see AR221

14 [describing continuing best practices TRA-3-a, TRA-3-b, and TRA-3-c].) These best practices

15 do not mandate that the University get City approval for its traffic and construction parking
16 plans, but the City provides no evidence of legal requirement to do so or evidence that failure

17 to do so would result in a significant impact to the environment. UC Berkeley's decision to

18 certify the traffic analysis of the Upper Hearst Development in the SEIR was not an abuse of

19 discretion.

20 The City also objected to the SEIR's analysis of noise impacis of the Upper Hearst
21 Development's potential noise impacts on nearby noise-sensitive land uses like nearby
22 multifamily housing developments, student housing, and academic buildings. The City argues

23 that the SEIR's analysis was flawed because it measured the baseline noise level during the
24 evening commute, resulting in an artificially high baseline for noise impacts. The City also
25  argues that the SEIR failed to describe the sources of noise that might result from the Upper
26 Hearst Development, including both ongoing sources of noise like HVAC operations and

30

sporadic sources of noise such as outdoor activities or special events. The City objects that the

2 SEIR reached its conclusion that no significant noise impacts would result without considering

3 the number, size, time, and frequency of events to be held at the event center at the Upper Hearst

4 Development. The City presented these arguments in its comments to the DSEIR. (See
s AR1202.) In response, the FSEIR noted that peak-hour ambient noise measurements are used to

6 characterize "the worst daily noise exposure near a Project site" and is a "more conservative
7| approach to assume that new residents on the Project site would be exposed too this noise level."
8 (AR890.) The FSEIR also concluded that "the noise associated with outdoor events would not

9 cause City of Berkeley Noise Ordinance limits to be violated at nearby sensitive receptors and

10 therefore[] would be less than significant." (AR908; see also AR201-202 [discussing noise from
11 HVAC and outdoor events, concluding less than significant impact on nearby sensitive

12 receptors].) Certification of the SEIR on this issue was therefore not an abuse of discretion.
