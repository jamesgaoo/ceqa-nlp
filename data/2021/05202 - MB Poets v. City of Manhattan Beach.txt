and cumulative level. and require conditions of approval to mitigate potential impacts.
2 Moreover, even if this class of exemption were applicable, the City could not rely on it for the

3 Project due to the Project's potential impacts to the area, the cumulative impacts of this type of

4 Project and the unusual circumstances of this Project's precedent setting size and intensity. An
5 exemption from CEQA was further impermissible because the City had to impose mitigation
6 measures in an attempt to mitigate various potentially significant impacts. No exemption is
7 permissible where mitigation measures are necessary to reduce impacts below a level of

8 significance.

9 5. The Project would have severe impacts in an area of Manhattan Beach renowned

10 for its peace and quiet, with streets named after Keats, Tennyson. and Shelley known as "the
11 Poets Section."*

12 6. For all of these reasons. the City should have required a full environmental impact
13 report (EIR) to determine the extent of the Project's impacts. and require Project revisions and
14 mitigation measures to address those impacts.

15 7. The violations of CEQA by the City have necessitated the filing of this action to
16 obtain a writ of mandate setting aside approval of the Project until proper environmental review
17 has been prepared and other appropriate relief. Accordingly, Petitioner requests that this Court
18 issue a peremptory writ of mandate to prevent the City or Real Parties in Interest from taking
19 actions based on the faulty Project approval and to require the preparation of environmental
20 review for the Project.

21 JURISDICTION

22 8. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1085 and 1094.5 of
23 the Code of Civil Procedure. and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

site. Skechers has been occupying the site since 2019. using the restaurant building as a
corporate cafeteria and meeting space while using the parking lot as overflow parking for
Skechers employees impacted by construction at Skechers* new office buildings along
Sepulveda Boulevard. The restaurant building would be demolished for the project.
5 The Project.

6 17. In early 2019, the City approved the Sepulveda Boulevard Corridor Overlay.

7 Among other changes to long-standing zoning and land use restrictions in the area. this Overlay
8 allowed a 40-foot height limit for hotel uses in the D8-Sepulveda Corridor Overlay Zone.

9 Environmental analysis of the Overlay zone was segmented from the hotel project currently
10 proposed, even though the proposed hotel Project was contemplated and specifically known to
11 City staff at the time the Overlay was reviewed. No environmental review of the Overlay Zone
12 was conducted as the Ordinance approving the Overlay stated: "It can be seen with certainty
13 that there is no possibility that the adoption of this Ordinance, and the amendments to the
14 commercial development standards or the zoning map established hereby. may have a
15 significant effect on the environment. Future discretionary development projects shall be
16 subject to CEQA and shall be subject to environmental review. The adoption of this Ordinance

17 a is therefore not a "project" within the meaning of CEQA and is exempt pursuant to CEQA
18 Guidelines Section 15061(b)(3)." Despite the statement in the ordinance approving the Overlay
19 Zone that "Future discretionary development projects shall be subject to CEQA and shall be
20 subject to environmental review," the City approved the Project with no environmental review

21 and claimed it was exempt from CEQA.
22 18. On August 9. 2019. the Community Development Department received an
23 application requesting a Master Use Permit for a new 162-room. 81.775 square-foot. four-story
24 hotel and a separate new 16.348 square foot two-story retail and office building at 600 S.
25 Sepulveda. at the northeast corner of Sepulveda Boulevard and Tennyson Street.

26 19. The Planning Commission conducted a public hearing on October 14. 2020 to
27 consider the request for the Master Use Permit. Numerous public comments were submitted in
28

FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

approved by the Planning Commission on November 18. 2020. Consequently, the final
2 resolution submitted to the city council for an up-down vote on the consent calendar contains

3 many tens of changes never considered in a public hearing.

4 26. Some of these modifications made by Community Development without council
5 direction will have substantial environmental impacts. such as deleting the requirement that
6 noise inaudible at the property lines. (Planning Commission Resolution PC 20-10. Condition
7 16). In the three appeal hearings during January-May, the city council never addressed deletion
8 of this condition that requires noise inaudible at property lines.
9 27. In the May 4 hearing, before the council vote that directed staff to bring back a
10 resolution with draft conditions for review, Councilmember Napolitano confirmed that a future
11 public hearing would occur, "I,1 would include it (a pay-parking condition) in the motion and if
12 the applicant can say that doesn't work for me or it does and then we can adjust it the next
13 hearing. So. there's no need to amend the motion."* (Emphasis added)

14 28. The May 4 meeting minutes state. "City Attorney Barrow clarified that the
15 applicant will have the opportunity to discuss the aforementioned conditions when the draft
16 resolution presented to the City Council." This only possible in a future public hearing.
17 29. At the end of the May 4 hearing, City Attorney Barrow reiterated that the public

18 would have an opportunity to review the draft conditions. as follows. "we will come back with a
19 resolution probably not the next meeting. but probably a month from now and of course we'll
20 give notice to all interested parties at when the resolution will be coming back. We'll notify them
21 with our usual emails and. I don't know if we use telephone calls anymore, but we'll, we'll alert
22 the appellants and the applicant of course. and the residents."
23 30. Despite all the above commitments for a public hearing, Community Development

24 converted Mr. Napolitano's "next hearing" into a consent calendar item on the June 15 agenda.
25 One-half hour before that meeting commenced. per the record. Community Development
26 Director Tai emailed the MB Poets petitioner with an unsolicited message that the city council

27 would not consider any further evidence other than that received prior to closure of the May 4

4 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (VIOLATION OF CEQA)

6 39. Petitioner incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

7 40. CEQA requires the City to conduct an adequate environmental review prior to
8 making any formal decision regarding projects subject to the Act. (CEQA Guidelines 8 15004).
9 The City has failed to do so for the Project. in violation of CEQA.

10 41. The City has relied on a Class 32 categorical exemption to approve the Project,
11 under CEQA Guidelines ยง 15332. The City's reliance on this categorical exemption is legally
12 inadequate for several reasons. including but not limited to the following.
13 The City Failed to Prove the Project Fits Within a Categorical Exemption
14 42. Class 32 categorical exemptions exempts in-fill projects from environmental
15 review if the following conditions have been met:
16 a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable
17 general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations.
18 (d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic. noise,
19 air quality, or water quality.
20 (e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.
21 (CEQA Guidelines ยง 15332.)
22 43. Categorical exemptions may be provided only for "*classes of projects which have
23 | been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment...* and should be construed

24 in light of that authorization. (Pub. ยง Resources Code. $ 21084. subd. (a).)
25 44. Regarding streamlined review of effects from an in-fill project. an exception to the
26 categorical exemption exists. if neither of these two circumstances exists: 1) The effects
27 previously analyzed in an EIR: and. 2) The "lead agency makes a finding that uniformly
28

after the Sunrise Initial Study concluded that an EIR was required.

2 50. Categorical exemptions are strictly construed. "in order to afford the fullest
3 possible environmental protection." (Save Our Carmel River v. Monterey Peninsula Water

4 Management Dist. (2006) 141 Cal.App.4th 677. 697.) It is the City's burden to prove that the

5 proposed Project fits within this class of categorical exemption. (California Farm Bureau Fed'n

6 V. California Wildlife Conservation Bd.. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173. 185-86.) The City has

7 failed to meet its burden in proving the Project correctly fits within a Class 32 categorical

8 exemption.
9 51. The Project does not fit within any class of categorical exemption for several
10| reasons including but not limited to the following.

11 52. First, the Project is not consistent with applicable land use plans and regulations.
12 The Project fails to provide the Municipal Code required parking. The Project exceeds the
13 allowable Floor to Area (FAR) ratio. Municipal Code required findings. including but not
14 limited to those concerning public safety and welfare (Mun. Code section 10.84.060.A subd. (2)
15 and (4)). cannot be made.

16 53. A Class 32 exemption is unavailable because the Project is inconsistent with the
17 City's Municipal Code requirements for parking. Staff stated that Manhattan Beach Municipal
18 Code (MBMC) Section 10.64.030 requires 243 spaces be provided for the site based on
19 proposed uses. (Oct. 14, 2020 Memorandum, p. 4 of 829: Nov. 18. 2020 Memorandum. p. 90 of
20 1060.). However, the City claimed this amount can be reduced pursuant to MBMC Section
21 10.64.050 (B) which allows reduction of required parking. The revised project thus has a total of
22 only 152 parking spaces, 91 spaces fewer than required by the MBMC.

23 54. Insufficient parking at a project can lead to environmental impacts from increased
24 vehicle emissions and vehicle miles traveled and overflow parking in the nearby residential
25 neighborhood. "CEQA considers project's impact on parking of vehicles to be a physical
26 impact that could constitute a significant effect on the environment." (Taxpayers for
27 Accountable School Bond Spending v. San Diego Unified School Dist. (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th

11 FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Hotel, for example. 171% more daily trips per room and 207% higher parking demand on
2 weekends.

3 59. Because the Resolution fails to specify the alcoholic beverage license type. it not

4 possible to evaluate impacts from traffic. parking and noise, whether Type 47 license for the

5 public or Type 70 for hotel patrons and guests. The analysis of alcohol license options falls
6  under the CEQA Guidelines requirement to evaluate alternatives that would "describe a range of
7 reasonable alternatives to the project. or to the location of the project, which would feasibly
8 attain most of the basic objectives of the project but would avoid or substantially lessen any of
9 the significant effects of the project and evaluate the comparative merits of the alternatives."*
10 (CEQA Guidelines ยง 15126.6 (a).)
11 60. The impact of the significant underparking of the Project site would mean that cars
12 not parked on-site would need to leave the site (adding further to disruption of traffic flow on
13 Sepulveda and surrounding streets at the already overloaded junctions) and then try to park in
14 the adjacent neighborhood. materially impacting an already-congested street parking scenario.
15 Traffic impacts would result from hotel guests. guests of those guests. retail customers. and
16 workers (of the hotel. retail establishments and offices) as well as any of the foregoing who do

17 not want to pay whatever the not insignificant parking charge the hotel is likely to charge non-
18 employees for parking- all circling the neighborhood looking for available parking.

19 61. The City lacks the necessary substantial evidence to support a finding that the
20 Project would not result in any significant traffic impacts. and as such, cannot rely upon a Class

21 32 categorical exemption for the Project.

22 62. The Project may also result in adverse traffic impacts that prevent reliance on a
23 Class 32 exemption. Project users would be required to search for on-street parking in the
24 vicinity, resulting in traffic congestion and safety risks for pedestrians.
25 63. Transportation engineer Craig S. Neustaedter opined that the traffic analysis
26 improperly omits Keats Street. Chabela Drive. Shelley Street. Prospect Avenue and 30th Street
27 the residential streets adjoining or near the Project. Furthermore. the KHA traffic analysis failed

week. Twenty feet from the east property line. a veritable wall of noise sources exists: 45
2 openable hotel-room windows. an open garage with patrons talking loudly and slamming doors

3 at AM, and a rooftop crammed with chugging air-conditioner compressors and whining fans.

4 MBI did not. however. evaluate the audibility of noise generated by the Project at the property

5 line. nor did they measure nighttime ambient noise levels to establish compliance with
6 Condition #16. (Rebuttal of Testimony by Applicant's Consultant MBI on 11/18/2020. Steve
7 Rogers Acoustics LLC. December 14, 2020. p. 4)

8 67. MBI assumed that only one of the 25 pieces of HVAC equipment on the roof
9 would be operating at any given time. In reality. noise impacts on the nearby residential uses
10 would be the combined effect of multiple fans and condenser units operating simultaneously.
11 (Manhattan Beach Hotel: Review of the Applicant's Noise Impact Analysis (*SRA Noise
12 Report"). Steve Rogers Acoustics LL.C. November 15. 2020. pp. 1.4.) MBI assumes an
13 unrealistically low level of speech effort for each individual talker in the rooftop bar, roof
14 terrace and hotel bar patio. (SRA Noise Report. pp. 1. 5.) MBI bases crowd noise impact
15 evaluation on a single talker. whereas Mr. Rogers* analysis estimated that the rooftop bar/terrace
16 could accommodate 200 people, with room for dozens more on the first-floor patio. (SRA Noise
17 Report, pp. 1.5.) Taking into consideration the noise impacts of multiple speakers, as well as the

18 noise analysis* inadequate assumptions for speech effort and failure to factor in alcohol
19 consumption (which can increase crowd noise). the true impact of crowd noise in the outdoor
20 gathering area of the hotel would be at least 30 dBA higher than MBI predicts - i.e. a net noise

21 level of 53 dBA. which would exceed the nighttime exterior noise standard in the [Manhattan

22 Beach Municipal Code section 5.48.160]. (SRA Noise Report. p. 5.) MB1 does not address
23 potential noise impacts associated with amplified music playback in the hotel. including live
24 music performances and DJ sets on the rooftop terrace. (SRA Noise Report. pp. 1, 6.) MBI
25 does not address noise impacts on the residential uses located on El Oeste Drive. to the west of
26 the project site. The homes on this street would have a direct line-of-sight to the rooftop
27  bar/terrace, approximately 300-feet away. (SRA Noise Report. p. 1.) MBI does not address the
28

Printed on Recycled Paper FIRST AMENDED PETITION 15 FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

P capacity will have a significant effect in adding traffic to the Tennyson segment west of
2 Chabela.

3 74. A categorical exemption is further inapplicable when "there is a reasonable

4 possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual
Icircumstances." (CEQA Guidelines ยง 15300.2, subd. (c).) This Project is unlike the typical
6 project for which the Class 32 categorical exemption was developed due to the surrounding
7 residential neighborhood and the Municipal Code requirements to which the Project does not
8 conform. These a unusual circumstances result in a reasonable possibility the Project may have a
9 significant adverse impact, preventing reliance on a categorical exemption.

10 A Categorical Exemption Cannot Be Used if Mitigation Measures are Required to Reduce

11 Project Impacts.
12 75. A categorical exemption for this Project is also improper because the City relied
13  on mitigation measures to approve the Project. "An agency should decide whether a project is
14 eligible for a categorical exemption as part of its preliminary review of the project without
15 reference to or reliance upon any proposed mitigation measures" (Salmon Protection &
16 Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098. 1106.) Reliance on such
17 measures "involves an evaluative process .and that process must be conducted under

18 established CEQA standards and procedures for EIRs or negative declarations." (ld. at 1108.)
19 Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th

20 1165.1191.1201 holds an agency may not "evade these standards by evaluating proposed
21 mitigation measures in connection with the significant effect exception to a categorical
22 exemption."*

23 76. The Project's scale and massing and parking would not be comparable to any
24 residential project in the immediate area and make it incompatible with adjacent residential
25 neighborhoods. The rooftop amenities also overwhelm adjacent residential uses with noise
26| impacts and aesthetic intrusion.
27 77. In a futile attempt to mitigate these impacts. the Project was conditioned upon a

28

FIRST AMENDED PETITION Printed on Recycled Paper 17 FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

84. Here. the City has imposed conditions of approval to mitigate the Project's likely
2 impacts. For this reason. the City cannot rely on a Class 32, or any other. categorical exemption
3 to CEQA review. Environmental review is required to assess the adequacy of the conditions to
4 mitigate the Project's impacts to less than significant level.

6 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

7 (VIOLATIONS OF CITY MUNICIPAL CODE)

8 85. Petitioner incorporates by reference herein each and every allegation contained in
9 the previous paragraphs.
10 86. Approval of the Project violates the Manhattan Beach Municipal Code (MBMC)
11 in various ways including but not limited to the following.

12 87. As described above, the Project fails to provide the amount of parking required
13 pursuant to MBMC Section 10.64.040.

14 88. As described above, the Project fails to comply with the noise ordinance pursuant

15 to MBMC sections 5.48.140 and 5.48.160. MBMC section 10.60.120 (A) incorporates the noise
16 ordinance into the zoning code by reference.
17 89. The MBMC required land use findings for a Master Use Permit required by
18 MBMC section 10.84.060 (A)(2) and (A)(4) cannot be made because the Project is not
19 compatible with its surroundings, adversely impacts its surroundings. and creates detrimental
20| impacts to public safety and welfare.
21

22 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

23 VIOLATION OF BROWN ACT)
24 90. Petitioner incorporates by reference herein each and every allegation contained in
25 the previous paragraphs.

26 91. The Brown Act. also known as the California open meeting law, has a clear
27 and forcefully stated purpose: *In enacting this chapter. the Legislature finds and declares
28

Printed on Recycled Paper FIRST AMENDED PETITION
19 FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 97. The City violated the Brown Act at the regular City Council meeting held on June

2 15. 2021 in connection with the City's approval of a hotel and commercial project located at 600
3 Sepulveda Avenue. (**Project") (Consent Calendar Item No. H(9).)

4 98. The Project agenda item. as discussed by the City Council on June 15, 2021, was
5 not properly noticed under the Brown Act. While the City did post notice of the agenda item

6 that would permit approval of the Project, the City did not provide notice that members of the
7 public would be permitted to speak on this issue. In fact, although members of the public were

8 ultimately permitted to address Item No. 9(H), the City agendized the item on the consent
9 calendar. This failure to post accurate notice of the public's ability to speak violated the Brown
10 Act and. therefore. any actions that it took at that meeting are null and void.

11 99. Agenda Item No. 9(H). the approval of the Hotel Project. relates to an
12 | administrative appeal filed by MB Poets. The City initially set a hearing of MB Poets* appeal
13 on January 19, 2021, which was then continued to February 2. 2021. and. eventually, May 4,
14 2021. At the May 4, 2021 appeal hearing for the Project. the City agreed to amend a few of the
15 Project's conditions of approval related to alcohol-service closing hours and parking. The City's
16 Minutes for the May 4 meeting state. "City Attorney Barrow clarified that the applicant will
17 have the opportunity to discuss the aforementioned conditions when the draft resolution
18 presented to the City Council." Such discussion would only be possible in a future public
19 hearing.
20 100. The City Attorney reiterated that the public would have the opportunity to discuss
21 the Project and the amended conditions at the next City Council meeting. City Attorney Quinn
22 Barrow stated. "Since we're coming back with a resolution with draft conditions. the applicant
23 will have an opportunity to. um, discuss those conditions just like anybody else, the appellants.
24 everyone can discuss those conditions. He repeated:
25 "We will come back with resolution probably not the next meeting. but

26 probably a month from now and of course we'll give notice to all interested
27 parties at when the resolution will be coming back. We'll notify them with

28

Planning Commission on November 18. 2020. Consequently, the final resolution submitted to
2 the city council for an up-down vote on the consent calendar contains many changes never
3 considered in a public hearing. Some of these modifications will have substantial environmental

4 impacts, in particular related to permissible noise levels at the property line. (Planning
Commission Resolution PC 20-10. Condition 16). In the three appeal hearings during January-

6 May. the City Council never addressed deletion of this condition that requires noise inaudible at
7 property lines.

8 104. The public, including MB Poets were never informed that they would have the
opportunity to speak on this agenda item. as promised at the May 4, 2021 City Council appeal
10 hearing. This is a clear abuse of the public trust and precisely the reason that the Brown Act
11 exists. The public has to be informed of the actions their elected officials propose to take. The
12 City violated the Brown Act in failing to provide the public fair notice of the public hearing of
13 the Project.

14 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

15 In each of the respects enumerated above. the City has violated its duties under law,
16 abused its discretion, failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and decided the matters
17 complained of without the support of substantial evidence.
18 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as follows:

19 1. For an alternative and peremptory Writ of Mandate, commanding the City and its
20 agencies and commissions to set aside and void any approvals for the Project and to require the
21 preparation of legally adequate environmental review before any reapproval of the Project.
22 2. For an order enjoining and/or staying the City and Real Parties in Interest from
23 | taking any action to construct any portion of the Project or to develop or alter the Project site in

24 any way that could result in a significant adverse impact on the environment. including the
25 surrounding community. unless and until a lawful approval is obtained from City after the
26 preparation and consideration of legally adequate environmental review and compliance with
27 the requirements of the Municipal Code.
