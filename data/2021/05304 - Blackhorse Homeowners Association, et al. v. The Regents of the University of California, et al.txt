1 INTRODUCTION

1. This action challenges approvals by Respondents The Regents of the University of

3 California and University of California, San Diego (collectively "University" or "Respondent") of the
Theatre District Living and Learning Neighborhood Project ("Project") and the related failure to
comply with the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code § 21000, et seq.
2. Among other things, the University failed to consider the environmental impacts associated

7 with the Project, failed to prepare and circulate required environmental analysis, failed to consider

8 feasible alternatives and mitigation, and illegally segmented project review. In addition, the Project
failed to comply with required mitigation.

10 3. Among other things, Petitioners seek alternative and peremptory writs of mandate declaring

11 the University's approvals invalid, and enjoining the University from taking steps to implement the

12 approvals.

13 PARTIES

14 4. Petitioner Blackhorse Homeowner's Association ("Petitioner") is a California non-profit

15 mutual benefit corporation that represents the owners of real property in the Blackhorse community.

16 Petitioner and its members have been injured as a result of Respondent's actions. Petitioner's

17 members use, enjoy, and benefit from the resources affected by Respondent's actions. Respondent's

18 actions adversely affect the aesthetic, community character, economic, environmental, public health,

19 safety and welfare, and recreational interests of Petitioner. The interests of Petitioner have been and

20 will continue to be adversely affected by Respondent's unlawful actions in violation of CEQA. The

21 relief sought in this Petition would redress Petitioner's injuries.

22 5. Petitioner La Jolla Shores Association ("Petitioner") is a non-profit corporation

23 representing residents, owners, and businesses in a variety of land use and community matters in La Jolla

24 Shores. Petitioner and its members have been injured as a result of Respondent's actions. Petitioner's

25 members use, enjoy, and benefit from the resources affected by Respondent's actions. Respondent's

,

1 will continue to be adversely affected by Respondent's unlawful actions in violation of CEQA. The
relief sought in this Petition would redress Petitioner's injuries.

3 6. Respondent The Regents of the University of California is public entity of the State of

4 California, as specified by the Constitution and the laws of the State of California.
7. Respondent University of California, San Diego is a public entity of the State of California, as

6 specified by the Constitution and the laws of the State of California.
8. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities of the persons or entities sued herein as

8 Does through 10, and therefore sues these respondents by such fictitious names. Petitioner will amend

9 the Petition to set forth the names and capacities of said respondents along with appropriate charging

10 allegations when the same have been ascertained.

11 PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY

12 9. In 2018, the University approved a Long Range Development Plan for the University of

13 California, San Diego ("UCSD") campus ("LRDP"). It also approved an associated Environmental

14 Impact Report ("LRDP EIR").

15 10. The LRDP EIR explained the "LRDP provides a policy framework to guide the physical

16 development of the campus based on academic, administrative, and support programs through the

17 2035-36 academic year ...." It claimed the "2018 LRDP would occur primarily through new
18 construction and targeted redevelopment .

19 11. The LRDP EIR explained: "Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines, this EIR is a Program EIR that

20 evaluates the effects of the entire 2018 LRDP at a program level.... Once certified, this EIR would also

21 be used to tier subsequent environmental analyses for future UC San Diego development projects

22 through the plan's horizon year."

23 12. In or around January of 2020, the University announced plans to pursue and develop what it

24 called the "Future College Living and Learning Neighborhood." Very little information was provided

25 by the University regarding this project, but a "fact sheet" provided by the University stated: "Proposed

26 on a 10.9-acre site, the Future College Living and Learning Neighborhood (FCLLN) provides residential

27 life and administrative space for a new college with approximately 2,000 undergraduate beds, classrooms,

28 an estimated 1,200 underground parking spaces, and conference and retail space.' This fact sheet also

Blackhorse HOA v. UC Regents Page 3
Writ Petition

1 indicated construction would start in the fall of 2020. The fact sheet did not address how the University

2 intended to address the environmental impacts associated with this project.

3 13. Both petitioners independently requested documents associated with the proposed project. The

4 University subsequently produced certain limited records, but nothing in that production indicated how the

5 University intended to address the environmental impacts associated with the project. However, in an

6 email to Petitioner's counsel, University staff indicated the University was preparing an addendum to the
LRDP EIR and that, once it was completed, the addendum would be posted on the University's website.

8 14. At some point in time, the University renamed the project the "Theatre District Living and

9 Learning Neighborhood Project." This revised project included additional features that would negatively

10 impact the community and the environment.

11 15. On or around September 2, 2020, the University posted on its website what it labeled

12 "Addendum No. 5" to the LRDP EIR. The Addendum is almost 300 pages long, and includes

13 appendices that encompass another approximately 3,000 pages.

14 16. The Addendum claims: "the Project WOULD NOT have new significant effects on the

15 environment that have not already been addressed by the 2018 LRDP EIR, no substantial changes have

16 occurred with respect to the circumstances under which the Project will be undertaken, and no new

17 information of substantial importance to the Project has been identified. However, minor technical

18 changes or additions are necessary, and in accordance with §15164 of the State CEQA Guidelines, an

19 ADDENDUM has been prepared."

20 17. Despite the massive amount of paperwork, University staff indicated the Regents would

21 consider the Project "at their September 15th through September 17th meetings."

22 18. Community residents and other interested parties, including Petitioners, had very little

23 time to review all of the papers involved and submit comments. Furthermore, University staff indicated

24 that while the Regents would make some opportunity for people to address them during their meeting,

25 "there is no guarantee that all who have signed up will be able to address the Regents."

26 19. Despite this rushed timeframe, Petitioner submitted comments in opposition to the Project

27 and Addendum in advance of the Regents' multi-day meetings.

28

Blackhorse HOA v. UC Regents Page 4
Writ Petition

1 20. Among other things, comments noted the Project was substantially different from the
LRDP and the analysis provided in the LRDP EIR. For example, comments noted the LRDP discussed
only housing for the area, yet the Project included other uses. Comments also noted the staff report for

4 the Project indicated the need for additional on-campus housing as a result of COVID-19, a
circumstance not considered by the LRDP and LRDP EIR. Comments also noted the lack of

6 consistency between the traffic and circulation analysis provided in the LRDP EIR and the Addendum.

7 Comments also noted the LRDP EIR did not analyze the Project's inconsistency with the surrounding
8 community character.
21. Comments also noted the changed circumstances, changed conditions, and new

10 information, all of which supported the University's obligation to prepare a subsequent or

11 supplemental Environmental Impact Report regarding the Project.

12 22. Comments also noted the LRDP EIR provided only a general level of analysis of impacts

13 associated with the LRDP, and did not provide the detailed analysis of impacts necessary to address

14 the specifics of the Project.

15 23. Comments also noted the University's failure to comply with mitigation measures required

16 by the LRDP and LRDP EIR.

17 24. Comments also noted the University's failure to provide for adequate public review and
18 involvement.

19 25. At their September 16, 2020 Finance and Capital Strategies Committee meeting,

20 Committee members spent considerable time discussing the Project, specifically questioning the $667

21 million requested by the University for the Project. After considerable discussion, the Committee voted

22 to continue the item to the following day.

23 26. No notice or agenda was provided of a Finance and Capital Strategies Committee meeting

24 on September 17, 2020. However, the committee met on that day, during a break from the full Regents

25 meeting.

26 27. At their September 17, 2020 Finance and Capital Strategies Committee meeting,

27 Committee members voted only to recommend that the full Regents "add an additional $5 million to

28

Blackhorse HOA v. UC Regents Page 5
Writ Petition

1 keep the design going and then later on, for November or any other time that they wish, to bring this item

2 back for approval."

3 28. Later that same day, the Regents voted to approve the Committee's recommendation, which

4 was explained by the Chair as follows: "the Committee approved an additional $5 million for continuing

5 the design until a later time. The Campus will bring back this item to us with all of the revised numbers

6 that they will receive subsequent to the preliminary design issues."

7 29. The Regents did not vote to approve the Project, any findings, or the Addendum.

8 30. However, a Notice of Determination was filed by the University on September 18, 2020. It

9 claimed the Project and Addendum were approved on September 17, 2020.

10 31. Furthermore, meeting "minutes" provided by the University claimed the Regents had voted

11 to adopt CEQA Findings, adopt the Addendum, and "[a]pprove the design of the TD LLN project, San

12 Diego campus."

13 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW 14

15 32. Petitioners have exhausted all available administrative remedies, and objections to the

16 Project have been presented orally and in writing to the University, as required by Public Resources

17 Code Section 21177. These include, but are not limited to, letters and oral comments presented during

18 public hearings.

19 33. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code Section

20 21167.5 by mailing a written notice of commencement of this action to the University. A true and

21 correct copy of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

22 34. Petitioners have advised the University that Petitioner has elected to prepare the record of

23 proceedings relevant to the approval of the Project, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section

24 21167.6. A true and correct copy of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.

25 35. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code Section 21167.7 by filing a copy of

26 the original petition with the California Attorney General. A true and correct copy of the notification

27 is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.

28

Blackhorse HOA v. UC Regents Page 6
Writ Petition

1 36. Petitioners have no adequate remedy at law unless the Court grants the requested writ of

2 mandate requiring the University to set aside its approval of the Project. In the absence of such

3 remedy, the University's approvals will remain in effect in violation of State law, and Petitioners will

4 suffer irreparable harm because of the significant adverse environmental impacts generated by the

5 Project.
