VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

OOAWN Petitioner, Coalition for An Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park, alleges:

Introduction
1. By this action, Petitioner, Coalition for An Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park
challenges the unlawful actions of the City of Los Angeles, its Planning
Department, and its City Council, (collectively, the City) to approve the
development of, and to adopt a CEQA Categorical Exemption for a project (the
Project) proposed to be constructed at 719 S. Hoover Street in the City of Los

9 Angeles (Project Site).

10 2. The Project was determined to qualify for the City's Transit Oriented
11 Communities Affordable Housing Program (TOC). The TOC is codified in Los
12 Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC) § 12.22.A31. The City approved Guidelines
13 under this program pursuant to a ballot measure known as Measure JJJ, the
14 "Affordable Housing and Labor Standards Related to City Planning" Initiative.
15 However, in adopting the Guidelines, the City exceeds the authority granted by
16 voters in enacting Measure JJJ. The City's reliance upon these improper
17 Guidelines constitutes an improper policy and practice of ignoring the voter's
18 mandate in Measure JJJ, and leads to the City disregarding the proper legislative
19 procedures for amending the General Plan and the zoning ordinances.
20
21 3. The approval of the Project is also inconsistent with the General Plan Framework

22 Element and the mitigation measures adopted for the General Plan Framework

23 because the Project, and other projects approved in reliance on the TOC

24 Guidelines, are approved without any finding and substantial evidence that the

25 City's infrastructure is adequate and capable of supporting the level of

26 development in the Project area and all other similar projects being approved in

27 reliance on the TOC Guidelines throughout the City.
28
29 4. The City abused its discretion in approving the Project and related environmental
185NRT documentation, as described above.

Parties
5. Petitioner Coalition for an Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park (the Coalition) is
an unincorporated association whose members include individuals residing and
working in the vicinity of the Project. The Coalition brings this action on behalf
35

- 1-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- of the public. Members of the Coalition have a beneficial interest in this case a

2 because the actions being taken by the City, and challenged in this case, affect

3
4 them directly as neighbors of the Project and members of the public at large. The
Coalition is aggrieved by the Project for the reasons set forth below in this

5 petition.

6
7 6. Respondent City of Los Angeles (City) is charter city and municipal

8 corporation and is responsible for regulating and controlling land use in the

9 City's territory, including but not limited to implementing and complying with

10 the provisions of CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, other California laws , and its

11 General Plan. The Los Angeles City Council (City Council) is the City's

12 legislative body. The Los Angeles Planning Department (Planning Department)

13 is a unit of City government having jurisdiction over certain land-use approvals

14 within the City. Respondent City is the lead agency for purposes of Public

15 Resources Code § 21067, with principal responsibility for conducting

16 environmental review for and approving the Project.

17
18 7. Real Parties in Interest, Albert Ganjian and Hoover 719, LLC are, on information

19 and belief, the legal and equitable owners of the Project Site and the Applicant
for the entitlements being challenged in this case (Applicant).
20
21 8. Petitioner is currently unaware of the true names and capacities of respondents

22 and defendants Does 1 through 10, and therefore sues those parties by such

23 fictitious names. Does 1 through 10 are agents of the Respondent and Real Party

24 in Interest who are responsible in some manner for the conduct described in this

25 petition, or other persons or entities who claim some legal or equitable interest in

26 the subject matter of this action. Petitioners will amend this petition to show the

27 true names and capacities of Does through 10 when such names and capacities

28 become known.

29
30 Jurisdiction and Venue

31 9. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this petition under Code of

32 Civil Procedure (CCP) $§1085 and 1094.5, Pub. Res. Code §§ 21167, 21168,
and 21168.5.
33
34
35

-2-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

10. This case is properly, classified as an unlimited civil case, and therefore within
2 the jurisdiction of this Court, because it is not one of the types of cases listed as
3 limited civil cases in CCP §§ 86, 86.1 or 87.
4

5 11. Venue is proper in this Court under CCP 394 because the Respondent City of
Los Angeles is a local agency with territory wholly within Los Angeles County,
6 which is where the Project's environmental effects will be felt.
7

8 12. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to filing this action,

9 including exhaustion of all administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

10 Petitioner and/or other agencies and individuals raised each of the legal
11 deficiencies asserted in this petition orally or in writing during the Respondent's
12 decision-making process.

13 13. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law 14 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondent to
15 set aside its certification of the Project and environmental documents. In the
16 absence of such remedies, Respondent's decisions will remain in effect in
17 violation of the state law and injurious to Petitioner.
18
19 The Project
20 14. The Project at issue in this case is the proposed construction of a new six-story,
21 73-foot high mixed-use building with 38 residential units located above 1,110
22 square feet of ground floor retail space. Four of the thirty-eight units will be
23 reserved for extremely low-income households, The proposed building will
24 encompass approximately 28, 302 square feet in total building area, resulting in a
25 Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of approximately 3.25:1. The Project proposes to
26 provide 21 automobile parking spaces on one subterranean level and one ground
27 floor level. The project will also provide 37 long-term bicycle parking spaces and
28 five short term bicycle parking spaces. A total of 2,925 square feet of open space
29 will be provided, divided between a sixth floor common area and private
30 balconies.
31
32 15. The Applicant applied for Project entitlements on July 11, 2019.

u 16. On March 19,2020, the Los Angeles Director of Planning issued a Director's

4 Determination adopting a class-32 CEQA categorical exemption for the Project

0 1 0 ü and approving the following Project Entitlements:

a. Transit Oriented Communities (TOC) Affordable Housing Incentive
Program Compliance Review; and

9 b. A vesting tentative tract map for the subdivision of one (1) lot for a new

10 38-unit residential condominium and one (1) commercial condominium

11 building, in the Wilshire Community Plan.

12
13 In support of the Project Entitlements, the Director adopted Conditions of

Approval and Findings.

14
15
16 17. The Project was determined to qualify for the City's TOC program. Pursuant to

17 this qualification, the Project received certain "incentives." This project received

18 the following TOC incentives for a "qualifying Tier 3" project: (1) a 70 percent

19 increase in density; (2) an increased floor area ratio of 3.25:1; (3) reduced

20 required parking of 0.5 spaces per unit. Additionally, the Project, requested and

21 received two additional incentives: (1) the utilization of the side and rear yard set

22 back requirements of the RAS3 Zone for a project in a commercial zone; (2) and

23 a maximum reduction of 25 percent in the required amount of open space. The
Project, thus, received a total of 5 incentives.

24
25 18. On April 3, 2020, Petitioner appealed the Director's Determination that the

26 Project qualified for a CEQA Categorical Exemption.

27
28 19. On September 3, 2020, the City Council's Planning and Land Use Management

29 (PLUM) Committee, after holding a public hearing, voted to recommend that the

30 City deny the Petitioner's appeal and approve the Categorical Exemption for the
Project.

31
32 20. On September 30, 2020, the City Council adopted the recommendation of the

33 PLUM committee, denying the appeal and approving the Categorical Exemption
for the Project.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

L
2 First Cause of Action

U Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)

4 21. Coalition for an Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park incorporates 11 1-20 as

5 though set forth herein.

6
7 22. In approving the Categorical Exemption for the Project, the City violated the

8 California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code §§ 21000-21189.3

9 (CEQA) and the CEQA Guidelines (14 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 15000-15387 plus

10 appendices) in significant ways, which are described in the following paragraphs.

11 23. On March 19, 2020, the City approved a class-32, "infill development project"

12 categorical exemption, under CEQA Guidelines § 15332(a), is that the Project be

13 "consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable

14 general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and

15 regulations." The Project does not meet the applicable requirements because the

16 City failed to provide substantial evidence of adequacy for utilities and public
services.

17
18 a.

19 There is substantial evidence in the record of inadequate infrastructure

20 and emergency services due to the influx of projects - many of them TOC

21 projects- approved and proposed for the area without environmental

22 analysis. There is substantial evidence in the record that utilities and

23 services are inadequate for The Project due to the cumulative effects and

24 unusual circumstances created by the influx of projects approved, and in
the pipeline, for the area in such a short time

25 span without a

26 corresponding increase in infrastructure, emergency services, utilities and

27 public services to support the influx of projects.

b.

28 Under the City's General Plan Framework mandatory mitigation measure

29 Policy 3.3.2, inadequate infrastructure and emergency services preclude

30 discretionary increases in intensity of development. A project is

31 ineligible for a Class 32 exemption unless it is consistent with all general

32 plan policies and zoning regulations. The project is not consistent with

33 the Wilshire Community Plan required findings of adequacy for

34 infrastructure, traffic, emergency and other public services.

35

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

y
2 24. CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2(b) contains exceptions that apply to the Project and
therefore prohibit the use of a categorical exemption in this case:
3 a.
4 Cumulative Impacts: There are numerous other approved housing

5 projects in the vicinity of the Project, which contribute towards

6 significant air quality, traffic, and noise impacts. The Project's

7 contribution to these impacts is cumulatively considerable.

8
9 b. Unusual Circumstances: A categorical exemption shall not be used for an

10 activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a
significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances - the
11
12 unusual circumstances being the influx in projects approved and proposed

13 for the area in such short time span, many of them TOC projects
approved and proposed without proper environmental analysis

14
15 Second Cause of Action

16 Violation of Measure JJ/

17 25. Coalition for an Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park incorporates 11 1-24 as

18 though set forth herein.

19
20 26. Under Section 7 of Measure JJJ, "any aggrieved person or resident of the City of

21 Los Angeles shall have the right to maintain an action for equitable relief to

22 retrain any violation of this Ordinance. The provisions of this Act shall be

23 construed liberally to effectuate its intent and purposes.

24 27. On November 8, 2016, voters in the City of Los Angeles approved a ballot

25 measure known as Measure JJJ. The ballot title of this measure was "Affordable

26 Housing and Labor Standards Related to City Planning." The measure was titled

27 by its proponents as "The Build Better LA Initiative."

28
29 28. Measure JJJ contains Section 6, which is titled "Transit Oriented Communities

30 Affordable Housing Overlay." Section 6 establishes Los Angeles Municipal

31 Code § 12.22. A 31, which is titled "Transit Oriented Communities Affordable

32 Housing Incentive Program."

33 29. Section 6 establishes a program for housing and developments within a one-mile

34 radius of a Major Transit Stop, as defined in Public Resources Code section

35 21155, subdivision (b). As set forth in Section 6, "Each one-half radius around a

- 6 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

L
2
COJaAD Major Transit, Stop shall constitute a unique Transit Oriented Communities
Affordable Housing Incentive Area."
30. Section 6 (Los Angeles Municipal Code section 12.22 A 31 (b) provides that
within 90 days of enactment, the Director of Planning "shall prepare TOC
Affordable Housing Incentive Guidelines ("TOC Guidelines") that provide the
eligibility standards, incentives, and other components of this TOC incentive
program descried herein." Measure JJJ provides that "[t]he TOC Guidelines shall

10 be drafted consistent with the purposes of this Subdivision and shall include the

11 following" standards regarding eligibility and incentives.

12 31. Measure JJJ Section 6 provides that "an Eligible Housing Development" shall be

13 granted TOC incentives, as determined by the Department of City Planning

14 A.31 allows

15 consistent with residential density increase and reduced parking. LAMC § 12.22
up to three specific ministerial incentives (FAR and density

16 increases, and reduced parking). This project received the following TOC

17
18 incentives for a "qualifying Tier 3" project: (1) a 70 percent increase in density;
(2) an increased floor area ratio of 3.25:1; (3) reduced required parking of 0.5
spaces per unit.
19
20
21 32. Measure JJJ Section 6, however, does not authorize the additional incentives

22 granted to the Project. The "additional discretionary" incentives granted to this

23 project were never approved by the voters. The Project received two additional

24 incentives, which exceed the scope authorized by Measure JJJ: (1) the utilization

25 of the side and rear yard set back requirements of the RAS3 Zone for a project in

26 a commercial zone; (2) and a maximum reduction of 25 percent in the required
amount of open space.

27 for a total of 5 incentives. In approving these additional

28 incentives, the City acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner and violated both

29 the directive of the voters in enacting Measure JJJ and the requirements of state
law and municipal code.

30
31
32 33. The Project's incentives are based on a tier system created by the City's adoption

33 of the TOC Guidelines instead of the Project's base zoning and density approved
as is required by LAMC § 12.22 A.31 and the voter-approved language of

34
35 Measure JJJ. The TOC Guidelines improperly provide for "additional" incentives
for reduction in required yards and setback, open space, and lot width; increases

- 7-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

in maximum lot coverage, height, and transitional height requirements. Each of

2 these "additional" incentives circumvent otherwise applicable limitations in the

3 municipal code without complying with the procedural requirements for zone
4 changes, height district amendments and general plan amendments or variances -

5 procedures which are meant to provide due process and full transparency.

6 34. The additional incentives granted for the Project violates LAMC §12.22.A31; as
7 such the Project is ineligible for a Class 32 exemption since in order to qualify
8 for such exemption, the Project must comply with all zoning and general plan
9 policies and regulations.
10
11 Prayer for Relief
12 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as follows:
13 1. for a peremptory Writ of Mandate:
14
15 a. directing the City to set aside and vacate its approval of the Categorical

16 Exemption for the Project;

17 b. directing the City to set aside and vacate all approvals for the Project,
18 including the Transit Oriented Communities Affordable Housing
19 Incentive Program Compliance Review, the Vesting Tentative Tract map,
20 and the associated Conditions of Approval and Findings;
21
22 C. ordering the City to cease all approvals of Transit Oriented Communities

23 under LAMC §12.22. A.31 unless and until the City Council adopts by

24 ordinance a replacement for the Transit Oriented Communities

25 Affordable Housing Incentive Program Guidelines; and

26 d. ordering the City and the Applicant to cease any and all activity related to
27 the Project that may result in a physical change to the environment unless
28 and until the Project is modified so that it is consistent with the applicable
29 general plan and zoning, and is re-approved following the adoption of a
30 legally sufficient CEQA document for the Project.

Please take notice that on November 6, 2020, this firm, on behalf of its client, Coalition for
an Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park, filed a petition for writ of mandate against the City of Los
Angeles, the Los Angeles City Council, and the Los Angeles Department of City Planning
(collectively, "City"). This letter provides the notice of lawsuit required by Public Resources Code
section 21167.7 and the Code of Civil Procedure section 388.
The Petition alleges that the City violated the California Environmental Quality Act, Public
Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq. ("CEQA") by determining that the project was exempt from
CEQA and approving the project without the environmental review required by CEQA. The Project
at issue in this case is the proposed construction of a new six-story, 73-foot high mixed-use
building with 38 residential units located above 1,110 square feet of ground floor retail space. The
proposed building will encompass approximately 28, 302 square feet in total building area,
resulting in a Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of approximately 3.25:1, and will sit on a rectangular, 9282
square feet lot located in in the community of Westlake/Macarthur Park. A copy of the petition is
included with this notice.

Very Truly Yours,

Claudia Medina Attorney for Coalition for an Equitable Westlake/Macarthur Park
