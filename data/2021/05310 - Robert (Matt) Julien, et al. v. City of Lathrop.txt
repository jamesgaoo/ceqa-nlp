INTRODUCTION
22

23 Petitioners, ROBERT ("MATT") JULIEN and REBECCA JULIEN ("Petitioners" or

24 "Julien") respectfully petition this Court for a Writ of Mandate pursuant to Code of Civil

25 Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and for a declaration of rights directed to the CITY OF

26 LATHROP ("City"), by and through the City Council, to vacate its approval of the Harlan Road

27 Realignment Project ("Project"), to set aside Project approval, including the Initial

28 Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration ("IS/MND"), and to undertake environmental review as
required by the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub.Res.C. §§21000, et. seq., hereafter

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT

1 "CEQA"), prior to considering the Project for approval. The City's actions in approving the

1 2 Project on March 8, 2021, violate Federal, State, and local laws and amount to a prejudicial

3 abuse of discretion. A writ of mandate is necessary to remedy the City's failure to adequately

4 address the Project's environmental impacts, to ensure the City complies with all applicable

5 laws, including laws regarding notice and conduct of public hearings, and to ensure proper

6 review, disclosure, and mitigation of the potential environmental impacts resulting from the

7 approval and development of the Project pursuant to CEQA. Additionally, the City's action in
8 approving the Project amounts to an unlawful taking and/or inverse condemnation by the City

9 because the City's approval of the Project has substantially damaged and de-valued Petitioners'

10 real property. By this Petition and Complaint, Petitioners represent the following:

11 PARTIES
12

13 1. Petitioner ROBERT ("MATT") JULIEN, at all times herein is, an individual

14 residing in LATHROP, CALIFORNIA. He is the owner of the Real Property located at 10980 S.

15 Harlan Road, Lathrop, California (the "Julien Property"). He is married to Petitioner, Rebecca

16 Julien. The Julien Property sits within the boundaries of the Project.

17 2. Petitioner REBECCA JULIEN, at all times herein is, an individual residing in

18 LATHROP, CALIFORNIA. She is also the owner of the Julien Property and is married to

19 Petitioner Robert Julien.

20 3. Respondent CITY OF LATHROP is, and at all times hercin mentioned was, a

21 general law city located in the State of California, County of San Joaquin. The City has a duty to

22 comply with state law requirements, including CEQA when considering land use proposals and

23 conducting public hearings thereon.

24 4. Petitioners do not know the true names or capacities, whether individual,

25 corporate, or otherwise, of Respondent sued herein as Does 1 through 100. Petitioners are

26 informed and believe and thereon allege that said Respondents are in some manner responsible

27 for the adoption of, imposition of, or administration of those laws, ordinances, regulations of

28 which Petitioners complain herein. Petitioners will amend this Petition to set forth the true

2
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT

names and capacities of the fictitiously named Respondents when such information has been
2 ascertained.

3 5. Petitioners arc informed and believe and thereon allege that each fictitiously
4 named Respondent is responsible in some manner for the occurrences herein alleged.
5 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

6 LAND USE APPROVALS AND CITY COUNCIL HEARING

7 6. On or about March 8, 2021, the Lathrop City Council held public hearing to
8 consider the adoption of the final IS/MND and approval of the Project.

9 7. Prior to the hearing, Petitioners submitted a letter to the City Council stating that
10 the Project description used in the IS/MND was inadequate under CEQA.
11 8. At the hearing, Petitioners also gave public comment on the Project expressing
12 why the Project description was inadequate and objecting to the approval of the Project.
13 9. Namely, Petitioners' comments asserted the City preparing a truncated
14 environmental review in violation of CEQA. CEQA requires that environmental review consider
15 "the whole of the action, which has a potential for resulting either in a direct physical change in
16 the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment."
17 10. As approved, the Project description failed to state what would become of the
18 Harlan Road area immediately north of Roth Road-i.e., it presumes that portion of the public
19 roadway would become private but does not explain the private road conversion of Harlan Road
20 in any detail.

21 11. The City stated that it removed any references to "private ownership" of the
22 currently public Harlan Road. However, the IS/MND also states, "Final ownership of the
23| roadway will be determined as part of the right of way negotiations during final design."
24 Additionally, the response provided by the City to comments on the Project stated, "If the public
25 road is converted to a private roadway, it will not require the formation of a property owners'
26 association…Responsibility for maintenance of the roadway will be determined during right of
27 way negotiations."

28

3
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT

12. As approved, the Project includes three alternatives for the road realignment none

2 of which has been chosen but each of which has been approved by the City Council.

3 13. Each of the three approved alternatives runs through the Julien Property to some

4 extent. Even if the City does not move forward with the Project, the Project approvals
5 authorizing the roadway to run through the Julien Property will remain unless and until modified

6 or repealed.

7 14. CalTrans submitted comments on the Project. In their comments, CalTrans

8 stated,

O An Enroachment Permit will be required for any work done within the
10 Department's right of way. This work is subject to the California Environmental Quality Act. Therefore, environmental studies may be required as part of the
11 encroachment permits application. A qualified professional must conduct any such studies undertaken to satisfy the Department's environmental review
12 responsibilitics.

13 15. The IS/MND was not modified to identify or describe such encroachment or to
14 || address the environmental impacts of this component of the Project.

15 16. Rather than assessing the environmental implications of an encroachment permit
16 now, as required by CEQA, the City stated, "An Encroachment Permit will be obtained prior to

17 construction. All applicable environmental studies will be provided at that time."

18 17. A fundamental component of CEQA is that a Project studied in an environmental

19 document, like the IS/MND at issue here, be the "whole of the action" which may significantly

20 impact the environment.

21 18. Here, the "whole of the action" of the Project is the realignment of Harlan Road--
22 including the potential privatization of part of Harlan Road and the Encroachment Permits.

23 19. The City's statement that the potential privatization of I larlan Road, as well as the

24 necessary encroachment permits being obtained at a later time are a violation of CEQA because

25 CEQA requires that all environmental impacts from a Project be evaluated in the environmental

26 document for the Project, not in a piecemcal fashion.

27

28

4
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT

- 20.

2 Accordingly, because the City did not proceed in the manner required by law

3 under CEQA, and approved the Project without fully evaluating the environmental impacts of the
Project, Petitioners bring this action.

4 21. Petitioners also commented that as proposed, the Project does not include
5 sufficient mitigation measures for the noise impacts from the Project.

6 22.

7 Petitioners presented evidence in advance of the March 8, 2021, hearing that the

8 Projcct, even with the mitigation measures from the IS/MND, would still cause significant
environmental impacts.
23.

10 In its environmental review, the City determined that the Project would cause

11 significant noise impacts from traffic, but concluded that those impacts would be reduced to less-
than significant levels because of the following mitigation measure:

12

13 NOI 1: Rubberized and/or open grade asphalt will be used on the southern portion of Harlan Road under all alternatives during Phase 1 and on the northern portion

14 of Harlan Road, during Phase 2, if Alternative 2 is selected.
24. The City determined that the Project could have potentially significant impacts
15 from the Project, but did not provide any meaningful discussion of what those impacts would be,
16

17 and proposed mitigation measure NOI 1, without any analysis. The City did not prepare a noise

18 study and did not consult a noise expert for mitigation measures.

25. Petitioners commented that scientific literature does not support the City's
19 conclusion that the mitigation measures, including the rubberized and/or open grade asphalt, will
20

21 be successful long-term at reducing noise from cars, particularly in heavily trafficked urban

areas.

22 26.

23 The City's IS/MND fails to consider the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation

24 measure, and does not address how the roadways would be cleaned to ensure their presumed
noise reduction efficiency.
25 27.

26 Petitioners also submitted a report titled, "Optimizing Rubberized Open-graded

27 Friction Course (RHMA-O) Mix Designs for Water Quality Benefits: Phase I: Literature

28 Review," prepared by University of California, Pavement Research Center at UC Davis and UC

5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT

Berkeley explaining why the proposed mitigation measure would be ineffective in reducing the
2 long-term significant noise impacts from the Project.

3 28. The City did not submit or prepare any reports to contravene this analysis.

4

5 STANDING, EXHAUSTION, AND RIPENESS

6 29. Pursuant to Public Resources Code $ 21177 Petitioners have satisfied any
7 requirement to exhaust administrative remedies concerning the Project. Petitioners commented

8 on the IS/MND in December 2020, submitted written comments to the City Council prior to the
9 hearing on March 8, 2021, and gave public comments objecting to the Project at the March 8,
10 2021 hearing.
11 30. Petitioners, commented on the Project and objected to the City's segmentation or
12 piecemealing of the environmental analysis for the Project-including the decision to delay
13 analysis of impacts resulting from potential privatization of Harlan Road, as well as the City's
14 failure to consider the environmental impacts from encroachments necessary to complete the
15 Project.

16 31. Petitioners have a direct and beneficial interest in the City's full compliance with
17 CEQA and all other applicable laws in approving this Project. Petitioner further owns and
18 operates a business at the Julien Property that will be directly impacted by the City's failure to
19 consider all environmental impacts from the Project.

20 32. The City a has a mandatory and public duty to comply with CEQA, and all other
21 applicable laws when approving the Project.
22 33. This claim is ripe for review because the City adopted the IS/MND for the Project
23 at its City Council meeting on March 8, 2021, and filed its Notice of Determination with the
24 County Clerk Recorder on March 12, 2021. It did not send its Notice of Determination to the
25 State Clearinghouse, despite it previously filing a Notice of Intent to Adopt MND with the State
26 Clearinghouse.

27 34. Petitioners will be directly and substantially affected by the adverse
28 environmental impacts and land use change that may result from the Project.

6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT

35. Petitioners have standing to bring this action, as residents, property owners,
2 taxpayers, and business owners in the City who will be adversely affected by this Project and
3 because they seek to compel a public duty in the form of the City complying with State and local
4 land use and environmental laws.

5 36. Petitioners have complied with Pub. Res. C. § 21167.5 by sending written notice
6 of this action to the City on or about March 26, 2021.
7 37. Petitioners will comply with Pub. Res. C. § 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure
8 § 388 by notifying the Attorney General of California of the commencement of this action.

9 38. Petitioners do not have a plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course
10 of law.

11 39. A clear and significant benefit will be conferred upon the general public and
12 Petitioners by City fully satisfying the requirements of State and local law in approving the
13 Project. A clear and significant benefit will be independently conferred upon the general public
14 by the City fully satisfying the requirements of CEQA. In instituting this action, Petitioners seek
15 to procure enforcement of a mandatory duty. Petitioners are vitally and beneficially interested in
16 | assuring that the mandate of law is fully satisfied and fulfilled. Granting the relief requested by
17 Petitioners would confer a significant benefit on a large class of persons, in that fundamental
18 rules of law would be affected.

19 40. By the authority of Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public
20 Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5 and 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue Writ
21 of Mandate to set aside the set aside the IS/MND approving the Project.
22 41. Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of action alleged in this Petition
23 arose in San Joaquin County where both the Project and the agency that approved the Project are
24 located.

25 42. Petitioners are under no obligation a to file a claim with the City pursuant to Cal.
26 Gov't. Code Section § 810 et. seq., as actions against a public entity for a taking of private
27 property pursuant to Section 19 of Article I of the California Constitution are exempt from this
28 requirement.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE: COMPLAINT

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 WRIT OF MANDATE-CODE CIV. PROC. 8§1085, 1094.5

3 (Prejudicial Abuse of Discrction - Violations of CEQA)

4 43. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein by reference the allegations contained
5 in Paragraphs 1 through 42, above.

6 44. The City committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in the
7 manner required by law by analyzing the Project in a piecemeal manner, in violation of 14 Cal.
8 Code Regs. § 15378(c). §
9 45. CEQA requires that when approving discretionary development permits, the
10 public agency must consider "the whole of the action, which has a potential for resulting either in
11 a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foresecable indirect physical change
12 in the environment." Piecemealing or segmenting a project into smaller portions resulting in
13 understated environmental impacts is not permitted.
14 46. CEQA Guideline 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15378(c), states, "the term 'project' refers
15 to the activity which is being approved and which may be subject to several discretionary
16 approvals by government agencies. The term 'project' does not mean each separate government
17 approval."
18 47. Finally, CHQA requires that an environmental review be based on an accurate,
19 stable, and finite project description. A project description that is inaccurate or unstable results
20 in an ineffective an unlawful evaluation of environmental impacts.
21 48. The City did not adequately describe the Project in the IS/MND and failed to
22 consider the impacts from the potential privatization of Harlan Road, or the impacts from the
23 encroachment permits required from CalTrans in order to complete the Project, stating that these
24 would be evaluated at a later date.
25 49. Petitioners presented substantial evidence that the City failed to consider the
26 impacts from the Project in its entirety, in violation of CEQA.
27

28

8
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT

50. Additionally, the City unlawfully deferred mitigation measures from the Project
2 to a later date, yet unknown, and used a truncated environmental review in order to approve the
3 Project in violation of CEQA.

4 51. Because the Project was approved in a piecemeal analysis, including failing to
S consider the environmental npacts from approvals for other agencies for the Project, including
6 without limitation, CalTrans and the City committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed
7 to proceed in the manner required by law by adopting the IS/MND and approving the Project.
8 52. Moreover, CEQA requires a public agency to prepare an Environmental Impact
9 Report ("EIR") whenever it can be fairly argued on the basis of substantial evidence that the
10 project may have a significant environmental impact. If substantial evidence of such impact
11 exists in the record, contrary evidence is not adequate to support a decision to dispense with an
12 EIR.

13 53. The City received from Petitioners substantial evidence of a fair argument that the
14 Project may cause significant environmental impacts in the form of noise due to an insufficient
15 and inadequate mitigation measur in the form of rubberized and/or open grade asphalt.
16 54. For example, Petitioners submitted a report from University of California,
17 Pavement Research Center at UC Davis and UC Berkeley stating why the proposed rubberized
18 and/or open grade asphalt does not reduce noise impacts from a Project long-term and is not
19 effective to reduce the identified significant impact to less-than-significant levels.
20 55. The City committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to procecd in the
21 manner required by law in adopting the IS/MND, rather than an EIR that would sufficiently
22 analyze the impacts from noise from the Project.
23 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

24 (Complaint for Damages - Violation of Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of U.S. Constitution and Cal. Const. Art. I, § 19: Unlawful Taking without Just Compensation) 25 56. Petitioners reallege and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained
26 in Paragraphs 1 through 55, above.
27

28

9
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT

1• 57. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that in doing all of
2 the things alleged herein, the City acted under color of the statutes, regulations, code, customs,

3 and usages of the City of Lathrop and the State of California.

4 58. As approved, the Project results in a regulatory taking or inverse condemnation

5 of the Julien Property.

6 59. As approved, the Project has three approved alternatives to re-route Harlan Road,

7 each of which involve the new road running through the Julien Property.

8 60. The approved Project alignment routing the Project through the Julien Property

9 make that Property unmarketable and/or unable to be sold and/or financed, resulting in

10 significant monetary damages to Petitioners.

11 61. City has stated it does not know when it will ultimately move forward with
12 eminent domain proceedings to acquire the Julien Property, but the approval of the Project has

13 caused an immediate and substantial devaluation of the Julien Property and has damaged

14 Petitioners.

15 62, To the extent the conduct of the City, as set forth above, was pursued for a public

16 use (i.c., the realignment of Harlan Road), the City violated Petitioners' rights by failing to pay
17  just compensation pursuant to the Fifth Amendment, which is applicable to the City under the

18 Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Article I, Section 19 of the

19 California Constitution. To the extent that the conduct of the City was in furtherance of a private

20 use, the City violated Petitioners' rights under the Fifth Amendment, which wholly prohibits a
21 taking of private property for a private a use. The City has failed and refused to pay compensation

22 to a Petitioners as a result of the actions set forth above.

23 63. As a result of the City's conduct as set forth above, Petitioners have been

24 compelled to retain legal counsel to prosecute this action and have incurred and will continue to
25 incur attorney's fees and costs. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988, Petitioners are entitled to recover

26 attorney's fees from the City.

.1 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

2 DECLARATORY RELIEF-CODE CIV. PROC. § 1060
3 (Failure to File Copy of NOD with State Clearinghouse - Tit.14, Cal. C. Regs §15094)

4 64. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein by reference the allegations contained
in Paragraphs 1 through 63, above.
65. City filed a Notice of Intent to Adopt the IS/MND ("NOI*) with the Governor's
7 Office of Planning and Research (sometimes called "OPR" or the "State Clearinghouse") on or
8 about November 19, 2020. The NOI advised the that the comment period on the IS/MND would
9 run from November 25, 2020 to December 30, 2020.
10 66. Petitioners submitted comments on the IS/MND to the City prior to the close of
11 the comment period.

12 67. City, as a local lead agency, adopted the MND and approved the Project on or
13 about March 8, 2021.

14 68. Tit. 14, California Code of Regulations § 15094(d) states: "If the lead agency is
15 local agency, the local lead agency shall file the notice of determination with the county clerk of
16| the county or counties in which the project will be located, within five working days after
17 approval of the project by the lead agency. If the project requires discretionary approval from
18 any state agency, the local lead agency shall also, within five working days of this approval, file
19 copy of the notice of determination with the Office of Planning and Research." (emphasis
20 added)

21 69. City filed its Notice of Determination for the Project ("NOD") with the office of
22 the San Joaquin County Clerk on March 12, 2021, but did not a submit a copy of the NOD to the
23 State Clearinghouse.

24 70. Because this Project will require discretionary approvals from Caltrans, a state
25 agency, including but not limited to encroachment permits, City was required to file a copy of
26 the notice of determination with the State Clearinghouse within five working days after March 8,
27 2021.

28

11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT

71. Tit.14, California Code of Regulations § 15094 (g) further provides: "The filing
2 of the notice of determination pursuant to subdivision (c) above for state agencies and the filing
and posting of the notice of determination pursuant to subdivisions (d) and (e) above for local
4 agencies, start a 30-day slatute of limitations on court challenges to the approval under CEQA."
72. Pursuant to Code of Civil Proc. § 1060, an § actual controversy exists between
6 Petitioners and City regarding whether, pursuant to Tit. 14, California Code of Regulations {
7 15094 (d), the City was required to file a copy of the NOD with the State Clearinghouse and/or
8 whether City committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion in failing to file the NOD with the State
9 Clearinghouse.

10 73. Pursuant to Code of Civil Proc. § 1060, an actual controversy exists between
11 Petitioners and City regarding whether, under Tit. 14, California Code of Regulations § 15094
12 (g), the City's failure to file the NOD with the State Clearinghouse prevented the
13 commencement of the 30-day statute of limitations.
14 74. Petitioners desire a declaration as to the validity of the City's obligation to submit|
15 the NOD to the State Clearinghouse. Such declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time

17 respect to the City's interpretation of its obligations under CEQA.

22 applicable CEQA statute of limitations.
