TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA:

2 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21167.7, that

3 on March 4, 2021, Petitioner, SIERRA CLUB, filed a Verified Petition for Peremptory Writ of
4 Mandate ("Petition") pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA")
5 challenging the approval by Respondent, CITY OF MORENO VALLEY ("the City"), of the

6 Moreno Valley Business Center project ("the Project"). The so-called "business center" project
7 involves the development of a a 9.98-acre site with a single, massive industrial building totaling

8 220,390 square feet. The Petition alleges the City failed to comply with CEQA in adopting a

9 Mitigated Negative Declaration (*MND") for the Project.

10 Sierra Club brings the action because the Project will be located immediately adjacent to

11 existing residences and commercial businesses, yet the adverse harms associated with the

12 Project have not been properly evaluated and mitigated in violation of CEQA. For the reasons

13 alleged in the Petition (transmitted herewith), the decisions approving the Project and adopting

14 he Project's MND must be overturned.

24 INTRODUCTION

25 1. This action challenges the approval by Respondent City of Moreno Valley ("City') on

26 or about February 2, 2021 of a land use project known as the Moreno Valley Business

27 Park ("the Project"). The so-called "business park" project will develop a mostly

28 9.98-acre vacant site with a single, massive industrial building totaling 220,390

L

A W square feet. The Project is fundamentally incompatible with surrounding residential

n and commercial uses. Neighbors of the industrial development will be subjected to

6 intense, relentless 24-hour, seven-day-a-week industrial operations, including

7 diesel truck trips. Petitioner, Sierra Club, brings this action because the City failed

8 to conduct appropriate analysis of the Project's operations; nor did the City adopt

Project.

o appropriate mitigation to offset the long-term, adverse harms resulting from the

11 2. The California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code ccn

12 21000 et seq.) requires an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for any project that

13 may have a significant adverse effect on the environment. Despite reasoned

14 comments in the record regarding the Project's significant environmental effects, the

15 City declined to prepare an EIR for the Project, instead relying upon a lesser level of

16 CEQA review, a Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND"). This was in error as the

17 record supports a "fair argument" of significant environmental harm.

18 3. Additionally, the City erred in approving the Project because the record lacks basic

19 information to support the conclusions of the Mitigated Negative Declaration. CEQA

20 requires facts and analysis to support the ultimate conclusions of any CEQA

21 document. The record before the City contains incomplete, inconsistent, and often

22 misleading information about the nature and degree of the Project's environmental

23 impacts. For instance, the conclusions of the MND rest upon technical studies that

24 were prepared for other land use projects. Thus the City has not complied with
CEQA's central purpose as an informational statute.

25

26 4. As a result of these CEQA violations, Sierra Club respectfully requests issuance of a

27 peremptory writ of mandate setting aside the approvals of the Project. (Code Civil
Procedure, §§ 1085 and 1094.5.)

28 5. By this verified Petition, Petitioner Sierra Club alleges the following:

-2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

L PARTIES

2 6. Petitioner, SIERRA CLUB, is a national nonprofit, environmental organization that is
tJ L dedicated to exploring, enjoying, and protecting the wild places of the earth; to
practicing and promoting the responsible use of the earth's ecosystems and resources;
5 to educating and encouraging humanity to protect and restore the quality of the naturall
6 and human environment; and to using all lawful means to carry out these objectives.
7 Members of Sierra Club's San Gorgonio Chapter live, work, and recreate in and
8 around the areas that will be affected by the construction and operation of the Project.
9 7. Respondent, CITY OF MORENO VALLEY ("City"), is a political subdivision of the
10 State of California. The City is a local governmental agency charged with the
11 authority of regulating and administering local land use and development within its
12 territory in compliance with the provisions of its general plan and zoning ordinances
13 as well as applicable provisions of State law, including CEQA. The City is the lead
14 agency for the Project and is therefore charged with the duty of ensuring compliance
15 with applicable laws.

16 8. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Real Party in Interest,
17 LCG 10MV LLC, is the applicant for the Project, the sponsor of the Project, has an
18 ownership interest in the property, and/or claims an interest in the Project approvals at
19 the subject of this lawsuit. "LCG 10MV LLC" is identified in documents prepared in
20 connection with the Project approvals as the applicant for the Project. Petitioner is
21 unsure of the precise status within California of the entity "LCG 10MV LLC".
22 9. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Real Party in Interest,
23 LEDO CAPITAL GROUP, LLC is the applicant for the Project, the sponsor of the
24 Project, has an ownership interest in the property, and/or claims an interest in the
25 Project approvals at the subject of this lawsuit.

of this lawsuit. Petitioner is unaware of the true names or capacities of the Real
2 Parties in Interest identified herein under the fictitious names DOES 1 through 100
3 inclusive.

4 STATEMENT OF FACTS
The Project
11. The Project is described as "Specific Plan Amendment No. 2" to the Moreno Valley

7 Festival Specific Plan (SP-205) for the development of a "business park."

8 12. The Moreno Valley Festival Specific Plan (SP-205) ("Specific Plan") was adopted,
O and the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was certified for the Specific Plan
10 project, on October 27, 1987. The Specific Plan ostensibly permits the build-out of a
11 planning area in the immediate vicinity of the site of the proposed Project and it
12 generally allows commercial, retail and other business-type uses. The Specific Plan is
13 divided into multiple "planning areas." The first amendment to the Specific Plan (so-
14 called "Specific Plan Amendment No. 1") was approved in 2018.
15 13. The Project, so-called "Specific Plan Amendment No. 2". expands the geographic
16 area of the Specific Plan's Planning Area 1 to include 1 the 9.98-acre site that is the
17 subject of the Project approvals. Thus, although the Project is described as an
18 "amendment" to the Specific Plan, the Project site was not part of the Specific Plan
19 area at the time of the Specific Plan's approval in 1987 or prior to the Project
20 approvals at the subject of this lawsuit including at the time of the approval of
21 Specific Plan Amendment No. 1.
80 14. The Specific Plan's Planning Area 1 originally consisted of 7.36 acres and is located
in the northernmost portion of the larger Specific Plan area; but it did not extend to 24 Heacock Street or include the 9.98-acre site that is the Project site. It is stated in the
25 Project's MND that "this proposed Amendment Number 2 that is the subject of this
26 [Initial Study /MND expands the geographic boundaries of Planning Area Number
27 1." According to the MND, the added area consisting of the Project site "will be
28 incorporated into the existing Planning Area 1. The affected Assessor Parcel Numbers

-4-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

2 (APMs) within the expanded Planning Area 1 include 481-020-13, 29, 30, 34, 38, and
38."
au Aw 15. The Project includes a plot plan approving the development of a 220,390 square foot
industrial building with 31 loading docks and truck trailer and vehicle parking stalls.
16. The site is located at the southeast corner of Heacock Street and Ironwood Avenue in

7 the City of Moreno Valley. Heacock Street connects to State Route 60 on the south
side of the Specific Plan Planning area.

8 17. Land uses surrounding the Project site include: existing single-family homes

10 immediately north of the Project site on the northside of Ironwood Avenue; single-

11 family homes and a commercial business immediately west of the Project site on the

12 westside of Heacock Street; and single-family homes along Nita Drive to the east.

13 18. The Project includes the following land use approvals authorizing the land use

14 changes and specific development proposal which are the subject of this lawsuit:

a.

15 Resolution No. 2021-07 certifying a Mitigated Negative Declaration

16 ("MND") and Mitigation Monitoring Plan for the Project pursuant to
CEQA;

17

18 b. Resolution No. 2021-08 approving a General Plan Amendment

19 (PEN20-0139) changing the land use designation of the Project site from
Commercial to Business Park;

21 Ordinance No. 978 approving Specific Plan Amendment 205

22 (PEN20-0138) to change the land use designation of the site from Retail
Commercial to SP205 Mixed Use;

The Project's Administrative Process

2 19. The City gave notice of its intent to adopt an MND for the Project on or about
4no 0v December 23, 2020.
20. On or about January 14, 2021, the City of Moreno Valley Planning Commission
reviewed the Project and voted by Resolution 2021-01 to recommend that the City of
Moreno Valley City Council adopt the MND and approve the proposed Project.
7 21. On February 2, 2021, the City Council conducted a public hearing on the Project and
8 voted 3-1 in favor of approving the Project including the MND.
o e= 22. The maintenance of this action is for the purpose of enforcing important public
policies of the State of California with respect to the protection of the environment
under CEQA and conformance with state law. The maintenance and prosecution of
12 this action will confer a substantial benefit upon the public by protecting the public
13 from environmental and other harms alleged in this Petition. Petitioner is acting as a
14 private attorney general to enforce these public policies and prevent such harm.
15 23. The City's approval of the Project will cause Petitioner irreparable injury for which
16 Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law. Petitioner and its members will be
17 irreparably harmed by the City's actions in approving the Project. Petitioner was
18 harmed by, among other things, the failure of the City to require the preparation of a
19 EIR to adequately evaluate the potential impacts of the Project, and by the City's
20 approval of the Project without providing adequate and effective mitigation measures
21 contrary to the requirements of State law.
22 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
23 24. Petitioner commented in writing during the administrative review process that the
24 CEQA review was inadequate in that the MND failed to properly disclose and
25 evaluate impacts and/or support its conclusions with evidence; the description of the
26 proposed Project was flawed within the meaning of CEQA; the Project would have
27 potentially significant impacts to/from the following: aesthetics, air quality, land use/
28

-6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

planning, noise, and traffic, among other impacts; and that the City did not adopt
2 adequate mitigation for these potential effects or adopt all feasible mitigation.
3 25. As a result of these comments in the record, Petitioner exhausted administrative
4 remedies pursuant to the requirements of Cal. Public Resources Code, § 21177.
5 26. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing the action by complying
6 with the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.5, in notifying
7 Respondent of the filing of this action (attached hereto as Exhibit "A"), and by
8 complying with the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.6, in
9 notifying Respondent of Petitioner's election to prepare the record of proceedings in
10 connection with this action (attached hereto as Exhibit "B").
11

12 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
13 27. This Court has jurisdiction to issue writs of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure
14 Section 1094.5.

15 28. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Sections 393 and
16 394 as the Project is located in, and the relevant events occurred in, Riverside County
17 County, and because the City is located in Riverside County.
18

19 CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (WRIT OF MANDATE- VIOLATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL
QUALITY ACT, AS TO ALL PARTIES) 21

22 a. The City wrongly adopted a Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project when there was substantial evidence of a fair argument of significant
23 environmental impacts as a result of the Project.

24 29. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 28 above as though

25 set forth in full herein.

26 30. As the lead agency, Respondent City is charged with the duty to fully and accurately

27 consider the environmental consequences of the Project through the preparation of an

28 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"). (Public Resources Code, § 21080 (d).)

-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

31. The EIR requirement is the "heart of CEQA." (Cal. Code of Regs., Tit. 14 "State
Nm sn CEQA Guidelines," § 15003(a).)
32. An EIR is required for any proposed project that may have a significant effect on the
environment. (Public Resources Code, § 21100 (a).)
33. If a lead agency is presented with a "fair argument" based on substantial evidence in
1Q the record that a proposed project a may have a significant effect on the environment,
7 the lead agency shall prepare an EIR even though it may be presented with other

8 substantial evidence that the proposed project will not have a significant effect. (State a
o CEQA Guidelines, § 15064(f)(1).)
10 34. A lead agency may prepare a mitigated negative declaration for a project only when:
11 (1) revisions in the project would avoid or mitigate the potentially significant project
12 effects to a point where clearly no significant effects would occur; and (2) there is no
13 substantial evidence in light of the whole record that the project as revised may have a
14 significant effect on the environment. (State CEQA Guidelines, § 15070 (b).)
15 35. The City was presented with substantial evidence of a fair argument that the Project
16 may significantly affect the environment within the meanings of CEQA for impacts
17 to/from, but not limited to, aesthetics, air quality, energy, land use/ planning, noise and
18 traffic. Petitioner and others submitted comments to the City based on substantial
19 evidence that the Project may result in significant environmental impacts that were not
20 adequately evaluated and/or mitigated.

21 36. By way of example, Petitioner commented there is a fair argument of significant a
22 environmental impacts, and an EIR is required by law, because the Project is a new a
23 source of greenhouse gas emissions, and it is not shown based on evidence that the

24 Project's GHG impacts are mitigated. The City's reliance on an MND is contrary to
25 CEQA insofar as the MND relies on the claim that the Project produces GHG
26 emissions below the alleged threshold of significance set by the South Coast Air
27 Quality Management District (SCAQMD"). Yet the threshold cited in the MND has
28 not been adopted by the SCAQMD as falsely claimed. Furthermore, as the Project

-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

p

2 may produce GHGs above the SCAQMD's proposed thresholds that would arguably

AW apply to the Project, the record supports a "fair argument" of significant
environmental impacts.

5 37. By adopting the MND for the Project where there is substantial evidence supporting a

6 fair argument that the Project may result in significant environmental effects, the City

7 committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and the Project approvals must be set

8 aside. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5; Public Resources Code, § 21168.)

o 3 b. The Initial Study Fails as an Informational Document.
38. Under CEQA, a prejudicial abuse of discretion may occur when relevant information

11 is not presented to the public agency. "When the informational requirements of

12 CEQA are not complied with, an agency has failed to proceed in 'a manner required

13 by law' and has therefore abused its discretion." (Lighthouse Field Beach Rescue v.

14 City of Santa Cruz (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1170, 1200.) "The failure to comply with
the law subverts the

15 purposes of CEQA if it omits material necessary to informed

16 decisionmaking and informed public participation." (Lighthouse, supra, 131
Cal.App.4th at 1201.)

17

18 39. CEQA requires that the lead agency investigate impacts. "CEQA places the burden of

19 environmental investigation on government rather than the public." (Gentry v. City of

20 Murrieta (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1379.) "Where an agency ... fails to gather

21 information and undertake an adequate environmental analysis in its initial study, a

22 negative declaration is inappropriate. (City of Redlands v. County of San Bernardino
(2002) 96 Cal.App.4tn 398, 406-408.)

23

24 40. Petitioner commented that the Initial Study, the document which was prepared to

25 support the certification of the MND, fails to adequately evaluate and disclose

26 impacts and/or substantiate its conclusions, despite comments in the record that

27 information was lacking or that conclusions were not supported by facts or analysis.

28 The Initial Study fails to substantiate its conclusion of "less than significant" or "less
than significant with mitigation" with respect to impacts including to/from: aesthetic

-9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

wN resources, air quality emissions, greenhouse gas emissions, energy, land use impacts,
noise impacts, and traffic impacts. By way of example:

a. The traffic impact analysis that purports to support the conclusions of the

a Initial Study was prepared for the previously approved Specific Plan

7 Amendment 1 project that did not include or evaluate the traffic impacts of

8 the Project, i.e., the 220,390 square foot warehouse development. The

=30 failure to properly and accurately calculate trip generation for the Project
hinders and skews other technical analyses of Project impacts.
b. The Mitigation Monitoring Program for the Project is the same program

12 approved for the Specific Plan Amendment 1 project with no further

13 analysis or mitigation of the potential impacts with respect to the 9.98-acre

14 Project site or the industrial warehouse development it includes.

15 c. All of the studies provided to support the MND, e.g., traffic, biological and

16 jurisdictional delineation, only addressed the Specific Plan Amendment

17 project and not the 9.98-acre site for the Project.

18 d. The air quality study that the MND relies upon was prepared for an entirely

19 distinct project located in a different air quality management district with

20 no relevance or relationship to the current Project.

21 c. In the area of energy resources, the Initial Study concludes that impacts will

22 be less-than-significant because "the project Applicant will be required to

23 closely work with the local electrical utility company to identify existing

24 and future strategies that will be effective in reducing energy consumption.'

25 Thus, the City deferred analysis and mitigation of potential impacts to some

26 future date, if at all. As a large industrial building, the Project can be

27 expected to consume significant building energy as well as transportation

28 energy (fuel) resources particularly in terms of heavy-duty truck operations.
Despite CEQA's requirement for analysis of energy

-10-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR PEREMPTORY WRIT OF MANDATE

2 resources, the Initial Study fails to evaluate the potential area of impact,

3 and it improperly defers analysis and mitigation to some future time after

4 Project approval and outside the administrative review process which is not
permitted under CEQA.

5

6 f. The Initial Study fails to provide any disclosure or analysis of the Project's

7 cumulative impacts in terms of either other industrial warehouses in the

8 City, particularly warehouses to the east of the Project site, or in terms of
the commercial area near the Project site and its traffic impacts as to State
= 5 Route 60 and local roadways.
41. The City could not conclude, based on substantial evidence, that the Project will have

12 less-than-significant impacts when there is no analysis, evidence, or data in support,

13 or when the alleged analysis does not pertain to the proposed activity that is the
subject of the Project approvals.
14

15 42. As a result of these and other failures of the City to properly study the areas of

16 potential impact, the public and decision-makers were deprived of sufficient

17 C. information to understand the adverse impacts of the proposed activity.

18 The Project Description Is Inconsistent and Incomplete.

19 43. Under CEQA, the initial study/mitigated negative declaration must contain a "project

20 description" which adequately informs the reader about the scope and nature of the

21 proposed activity. (State CEQA Guidelines § 15071 (a).) An inaccurate or incomplete

22 project description undermines CEQA's purposes, particularly where it minimizes the

23 project's environmental impacts. "An accurate, stable, and finite project description is
the sine qua non of an informative and
24 legally sufficient EIR." (County of Inyo V. City

25 of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 192-93.)

26 44. In a similar respect, CEQA requires analysis of the "whole of the [project]." (Laurel

27 Heights Improvement Ass'n of San Francisco, Inc. V. Regents of Univ. of Cal. (1988) 47

28 Cal.3d 376, 395-96; State CEQA Guidelines 15378.) All phases of a project must be

M considered when performing CEQA review. (State CEQA Guidelines § 15063 (a)(1);
2 City of Antioch v. City Council (1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1325, 1334.)
( v 45. Petitioner commented in the record that the Initial Study fails to provide an accurate 01
complete Project Description with respect to the entirety of the proposed Project, and
5 that the MND fails to evaluate the entirety of the proposed activity constituting "the
6 project," including, but not limited to,

7 a. The MND's lack of a description of the anticipated or reasonably
8 foreseeable operational activities of the industrial warehouse building
9 including disclosure of the Project's anticipated truck trips; paths of truck
10 travel; hours of operation of the building, and on-site noise generating
11 activities such as truck movements, truck horns, opening/closing of loading
12 dock doors, and parking lot activity.
13 b. The MND's inconsistent and conflicting descriptions of the Project insofar
14 as the Project is sometimes described as a "commercial" project, a "retail" a
15 project, or a "business park" development;
16 C. The absence of any meaningful analysis as to the design and configuration
17 of the warehouse/distribution facility, including any analysis with respect to
18 the operational components of the warehouse project, such as the number of
19 truck trips it will generate.

20 46. As a result of the MND's failure to properly describe and evaluate the entirety of the
21 proposed activity, the public and decision-makers were unable to understand the
22 Project's potential impacts or appropriately comment on the anticipated impacts.
23 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for the following relief on all causes of action:
24 47. For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring Respondent to set aside its
25 decision approving the Mitigated Negative Declaration and the land use approvals for
26 the Project. (Public Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.9; Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1094.5,
