1 Petitioner and Plaintiff Santa Monica Bayside Owners Association ("Petitioner" or
2 "SMBOA") seeks relief from the unlawful approval of a Coastal Development Permit by the

3

4 Respondents and Defendants California Coastal Commission ("Commission") and applicant City

5 of Santa Monica ("City") for the demolition of a visitor-serving, six-story public parking garage

6 with 337 parking spaces (Parking Structure #3). This action is brought pursuant to the California
Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"; Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq.) and the
7 California Coastal Act ("Coastal Act"; Public Resources Code Section 30000 et seq.), as

8 Respondents claim an inapplicable statutory exemption from CEQA, did not perform an adequate

ERVIN COHEN & JESSUP LLP 3 environmental review of the proposed project, and failed to consider substantial evidence
10 presented by members of the public and Petitioner that this demolition, as approved, will have
11 significant, unmitigated impacts on the environment and the downtown Santa Monica community.
12 Petitioner thus requests a writ of mandate and declaratory and injunctive relief under Code of Civil
13 Procedure Sections 1085 and 1094.5, and alleges as follows:

14 INTRODUCTION

15 1.

16 In an effort to pursue the noble goal of providing more affordable housing, the City
of Santa Monica ("City") decided in April 2019 to redevelop one of its downtown properties to
17 accommodate an undefined and unfunded mixed-use project with affordable dwelling units. The

18 problem is that the identified site- -a 30,000 square foot parcel at 1318 & 1320 Fourth Street,
19 adjacent to the economic juggernaut of the Third Street Promenade--already contains a six-story,
20 150,000 square foot concrete public parking structure with 337 vehicular spaces, known as
21 Parking Structure #3. To achieve its ultimate goal, the City apparently feels that it needs to
22 demolish the heavily-used public facility, which has consistently served Santa Monica residents,
23 businesses, and beach-going tourists since 1968.

24 2. Prudence, good governance, and the law dictate that demolition of such an
25 important and integral site in the City's bustling downtown would occur only AFTER robust
26 public debate and adoption of a plan, including a financial commitment, to execute the
27 replacement project. Sadly and wrongfully, the City chose not to follow that path. Despite the fact
28 that a Request for Proposals issued in April 2019 failed to yield a suitable developer for a mixed-
SANTA MONICA_PWM.6.15.21 2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
ATYTIATOPIVD DOI IER

1 use project including affordable housing on the site, the City continued to pursue demolition in a
2 vacuum. It hired a civil engineer in July 2019 to prepare demolition plans, and ultimately

3 submitted a complete application to the California Coastal Commission ("Commission") for the
4 required Coastal Development Permit ("CDP") in November 2020.

5 3. However, at no point in its dogged pursuit of demolition did the City conduct any

6 outreach or public hearings specifically to consider whether the residents and businesses of Santa

7 Monica thought demolition of Parking Structure #3 was a good idea. Indeed, there has been no

8 discussion by the City with businesses that rely on this particular parking structure about how the
9 proposed demolition impacts their operations and long-term viability. After enduring nearly 14
mdnssar g N3HOD ERVIN 10 months of governmental restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, local businesses continue to
11 face precarious financial circumstances, and property owners regularly confront the difficulty of
12 leasing vacant commercial space (made even more challenging without the prospect of available
13 parking due to the City's actions).

14 4. Ignoring the community's and downtown area businesses' concerns, the City
15 insisted on framing the proposed project as only about providing affordable housing-without a
16 project having been approved or even determined to be feasible, and in the face of the results of its
17 a Request for Proposal's having provided a strong indication that such a project is not feasible. Yet
18 the City sought to secure the Commission's approval only for demolition, even though that
19 activity and development of the mixed-use affordable housing project are inextricably intertwined;

20 put differently, there was and is no reason or basis to demolish Parking Structure #3 unless and
21 until there is a feasible project ready to replace it. Over the objections of the Petitioner and several

22 residents and business owners, who challenged not only the necessity and urgency of the proposed
23 demolition, but also the project's inadequate environmental review, the Commission approved the
24 City's CDP application on May 13, 2021.

25 5. With no other option, Petitioner filed the instant petition to overturn to the
26 Commission's unlawful project approval. In particular, Petitioner challenges the City's approach

27 to satisfying the CDP's environmental review requirements dictated by the California
28 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") for two reasons: (1) the City has improperly claimed that
SANTA MONICA_PWM.6.15.21
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
TATITIAICTIVD DRE TRD

the demolition project qualifies for a statutory exemption as ministerial action, and (2) the City's
segmenting or "piecemealing" of the project into two projects-demolition and the affordable
3 housing project-is explicitly prohibited by statute. Moreover, the Commission's approval runs

4

5 counter to established Coastal Act policies ensuring public access to coastal resources.

6.

6 The truth is that the City has purposefully evaded the basic requirements for

7 environmental review in order to push through an unapproved, speculative, infeasible and
undefined mixed-use affordable housing project. Throughout this process, the City has blatantly
8 | disregarded the interests and will of the public, including the thousands of residents, businesses,

9

ERVIN COHEN & JESSUP LILP 6 and visitors who regularly rely on Parking Structure #3 to serve as their everyday access to the
10| beach, shops, restaurants, and offices in the bustling downtown area. The City's unnecessary drive
11 to demolish Parking Structure #3 now-without an actual plan, developer, or funding in place for
12 the mixed-use affordable housing project to follow-is premature and would invariably leave an
13 irreparable, gaping hole in the downtown streetscape. Because the City and Commission abused
14 their discretion in approving the proposed demolition, and the decision is not supported by
15 adequate findings, the CDP must be set aside.

16 THE PARTIES

17 7. Petitioner and Plaintiff, SANTA MONICA BAYSIDE OWNERS ASSOCIATION,
18 is a California nonprofit 501c(3) organization duly formed under the laws of the State of
19 California. SMBOA is composed of commercial property owners, business owners, and residents
20 | who are concerned about the current state of the downtown area of Santa Monica as well as its
21 future viability. The members of the organization participated in the administrative process before
22 the Commission and submitted written and oral comments to the Commission and the City of
23 Santa Monica during the administrative process. Petitioner's members are residents and taxpayers
24  of the City of Santa Monica and are filing this action as private attorneys general.

25 8. As residents, property and business owners, and visitors to the Santa Monica
26 coastal area, Petitioner and its members have been injured as a result of the Respondents' actions
27 approving the demolition of Parking Structure #3. Respondents' actions adversely affect the
28 safety, environmental, aesthetic and economic interests of Petitioner and Petitioner's members.
SANTA MONICA_PWM.6.15.21
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INTI INOTIVE DII TRR

The interests of Petitioner's members have been and will continue to be adversely affected by
2 Respondents' unlawful actions in violation of the California Coastal Act ("Coastal Act"),
3 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") and the Code of Civil Procedure ("CCP"). The

4.

5 relief sought in this Petition would redress Petitioner and Petitioner's injuries.

9. Respondent and Defendant CITY OF SANTA MONICA (the "City") is the public
6 governmental entity serving the people of the City of Santa Monica.

7 10.

8 Respondent and Defendant CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION is a
regulatory agency of the State of California and the government agency charged by law with

NEHOO NIA83 mdnssar 9 administering the provisions of the California Coastal Act, Public Resources Code Section 30000
10 et seq. and regulating the administration of the City of Santa Monica's Local Coastal Program.

11 11. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacity of the persons or entities sued

us 12 herein as Does through 5, and therefore sues these respondents by fictitious names. Petitioner
13 will amend the Petition to set forth names and capacity of said respondents along with appropriate
14 charging allegations when the same have been ascertained.

15

16 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

12. This Court has original jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Article VI, Section
17 10 of the California Constitution and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the California Code of Civil
18 Procedure, as well as California Public Resources Code § 21000.

19 13. Venue is proper pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Sections 394 and 395 in that
20 Respondents are government entities or agents of the City of Santa Monica and the State of
21 California, this matter relates to subject property located within, and discretionary, quasi-judicial,
22 administrative and ministerial actions were decided within this Court's jurisdiction, and this is the
23 area in which some or all of the parties reside.

24

25 EXHAUSTION OF REMEDIES

14. Petitioner, as well as other parties, provided written objections and presented its
26 opposition during the only public hearing the Commission's May 13, 2021 meeting-on the
27 proposed approval of the CDP. Specifically, Petitioner challenged the proposed CDP because the
28 City's application violated CEQA and the California Coastal Act on all grounds raised herein.

1 Petitioner has exhausted all available administrative remedies, and objections to the demolition
2 have been presented orally and in writing to the Respondents.

3 15. Petitioner provided the City with notice that it intended to commence this action, in

4 compliance with California Public Resources Code Section 21167.5. A true and correct copy of
5 Petitioner's Notice to the City and its proof of service is attached as Exhibit A and incorporated

6 herein by this reference.

7 16. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of California Public Resources Code

3 10 Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Injunctive and Declaratory Relief on the
JESSUP 11 Attorney General is attached hereto as Exhibit B and is incorporated herein by this reference.

12 17. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law unless this Court grants the requested writ

4g
NIHOO NIA83 13 of mandate requiring Respondents to set aside their approvals of a Coastal Development Permit
14 for the demolition of Parking Structure #3. In the absence of such remedy, Respondents' approval
15 will remain in effect in violation of State law, and Petitioner will suffer irreparable harm because
16 of significant adverse impacts on coastal resources generated by the Project that will not have been
17 properly analyzed under the Coastal Act and CEQA.

18 18. Petitioner has satisfied each and every exhaustion-of-remedies requirement that
19 must be satisfied in order to maintain this action. In particular:

20 A. The violations of law challenged in this action were identified for
21 Respondents orally and in writing by Petitioner, as well as representatives for Petitioner and other
22 private citizens prior to the close of the public hearing on the CDP Application, as required by
23 Public Resources Code Section 21177, subdivision (a).

24 B. Petitioner objected to the CDP's approval prior to the close of the
25 Coastal Commission's public hearing on the CDP Application, as required by Public Resources
26 Code section 21177, subdivision (b).

27 C. No further appeals were available and Respondents' CDP Approvals
28 are now final.

STATUTORY SCHEME

11 California Environmental Quality Act

12 21. The California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code
13 Section 21000 et seq., establishes a comprehensive scheme to provide long-term protection of the
14 environment and notify the public of a project's potential impacts on the environment. It
15 prescribes review procedures a public agency must follow before approving or carrying out certain
16 .projects. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 subd. (a).)

17 22. CEQA must be interpreted in such a manner as to afford the fullest possible
18  protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language. Code of
19 Regulations Section 15000-15387 ("State CEQA Guidelines), Section 15378 defines a "Project"

20 as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in
a 21 the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment, and that

22 is any of the following:

23

24 (1) An activity directly undertaken by any public agency including but not limited to

25 public works construction and related activities clearing or grading of land, improvements

26 to existing public structures, enactment and amendment of zoning ordinances, and the

27 adoption and amendment of local General Plans or elements thereof pursuant to

Government Code Sections 65100-65700.

28
SANTA MONICA PWM.6.15.21
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
TATIT INATID D DT YED

(2) An activity undertaken by a person which is supported in whole or in part through
public agency contracts, grants, subsidies, loans, or other forms of assistance from one or
more public agencies.
(3) An activity involving the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or
other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies."

23. Since the Act only applies to projects of a discretionary, rather than a ministerial
7 character (Pub. Resources Code § 21080), doubts whether a project is discretionary or ministerial
8 should be resolved in favor of a finding that it is discretionary. If a project approval features both

9

ERVIN COHEN & JESSUP LLP 425 ministerial and discretionary elements, the project is deemed discretionary and subject to CEQA
10 review (CEQA Guidelines, § 15268, subd. (d).)

11 24. CEQA is not merely a procedural statute; it imposes clear and substantive
12 responsibilities on agencies that propose to approve projects, requiring that public agencies not
13 approve projects that harm the environment unless and until all feasible mitigation measures are
14 employed to minimize the harm. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21002; 21002.1 subd. (b).)
15 25. Failure to either comply with the substantive requirements of CEQA or to carry out
16 the full CEQA procedures so that complete information as to a project's potential or actual
17 impacts is developed and publicly disclosed constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion that
18 requires invalidation of the public agency action regardless of whether full compliance would have
19 produced a different result. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21005.)

20 26. In order to be considered ministerial, a decision must be one that an administrative
21 agency itself is forced to follow pursuant to a standard fixed by a statute or ordinance; it cannot be
22 based upon a standard that the agency exercised its own discretion to create and which it possesses
23 the discretion to modify or ignore. Thus, formal and informal policies established by a city, by
24 which it approves building permits for construction projects, does not convert discretionary
25 decisions involved in the approval process for a major construction (or demolition) project to
26 ministerial ones within the meaning of Pub. Resources Code, § 21080, which provides that CEQA
27 applies only to discretionary, not ministerial, projects.

27. A "discretionary" act or decision is one that "requires the exercise of judgment or
2 deliberation when the public agency or body decides to approve or disapprove a particular activity,
3 as distinguished from situations where there has been conformity with applicable statutes,
4| ordinances, or regulations." (CEQA Guidelines § 15357.)

5 28. A "ministerial" decision is one "involving little or no personal judgment by the
6 public official as to the wisdom or manner of carrying out the project." A ministerial act or

7 decision involves only the use of fixed standards or objective measurements, and the public

8 official cannot use personal, subjective judgment in deciding whether or how the project should be

9 carried out. (CEQA Guidelines § 15369.)

d1dnssar9 NIHOO NIAN3 10 29. Agencies may not undertake actions that could have a significant adverse effect on
11 the environment, or limit the choice of alternatives or mitigation measures, before complying with
12 CEQA. (14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15004(b)(2).) The "lead agency," which is the public agency that

13 has the principal responsibility for carrying out the project, is responsible for conducting an initial
14 study to determine, in consultation with other relevant state agencies, whether an environmental
15 impact report, a negative declaration, or a mitigated negative declaration will be prepared for a
16 project. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21067; 21080.1, subd. (a); 21083.3, subd. (a).)

17 30. The Guidelines require "all phases of project planning, implementation, and
18 operation" to be considered in the Initial Study for a project. (14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15063(a)(1).)
19 CEQA defines a project as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a
20 direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in
21 the environment." (14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15378(a).)

22 31. An EIR must be prepared "i]f there is substantial evidence, in light of the whole
23 record before the lead agency, that the project may have a significant effect on the environment..."
24 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21080 subd. (d).) That is, an EIR must be prepared "if a lead agency is
25 presented a with a fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the environment
26 even though it may also be presented with other substantial evidence that the project will not have

27 a significant effect." (14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15064(f)(1).)

28 ///
SANTA MONICA_PWM.6.15.21 9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
TATITINIOTIUE DOT T2E

32. Under certain circumstances, the public agency evaluating a proposed project may
2. find that an EIR is not required. In such cases, the agency may adopt a negative declaration
3 ("ND") or a mitigated negative declaration ("MND"). A negative declaration may be prepared and

4

5 adopted for a proposed project that "will not have a significant effect on the environment and does

6 not require the preparation of an environmental impact report." (Pub. Resources Code § 21064.)
An MND may be prepared or adopted when "revisions in the project plans ... would avoid the
7 effects or mitigate the effects to a point where clearly no significant effect on the environment
8 would occur" and "there is no substantial evidence in light of the whole record before the public

ERVIN COHEN & JESSUP LLP 9 agency that the project, as revised, may have a significant effect on the environment." (Pub.
10 Resources Code § 21064.5.) If neither of these conditions applies to the project in question, the
11 agency must prepare an EIR.
12 33. A negative declaration must contain: (1) a description of the project; (2) the
13 location of the project; (3) a proposed finding that the project does not have a significant
14 environmental impact; (4) a copy of the initial study documenting the reasons to support the
15 finding; and (5) mitigation measures, if any, incorporated into the project. (14 Cal. Code Regs., §
16 15071.)

17 34. Because informing the public about the potential and actual environmental impacts
18 of a proposed project is a critical function of CEQA, any proposed mitigation measures in the
19 MND must be made available for public review and comment prior to the adoption of the MND.
20 •(Pub. Resources Code § 21081.6(c).)

21 California Coastal Act

22 35. The California Coastal Act ("Coastal Act"), Public Resources Code § 30000 et
23 seq., specifically states one of its primary goals is to "maximize public access to and along the
24 coast and maximize public recreational opportunities in the coastal zone consistent with the sound
25 resources conservation principles and constitutionally protected rights of private property owners."
26 (Pub. Resources Code § 30001.5(c).)

27 36. The Coastal Act also specifies that "Wherever appropriate and feasible, public
28 facilities, including parking areas or facilities, shall be distributed throughout an area so as to

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
TATTT IAIATIUE DET TUE

1 mitigate against the impacts, social and otherwise, of overcrowding or overuse by the public of
2 any single area." (Pub. Resources Code § 30212.5)

3 37. As with other Coastal Act policies, the Coastal Commission has discretion to
4 determine adequacy of parking for development in the coastal zone, in determining whether to
5 issue a coastal development permit. (Pub. Resources Code § 30603)

FACTS
7

8 38. Since its opening in 1968, Parking Structure #3 at 1318 and 1320 Fourth Street in

9 Santa Monica has been an integral part of the downtown landscape and is vital to the local
9 10 economy. The 337-space public facility is one of the coastal community's most heavily used 1dnSSar 3 NEHOD ERVIN 11 parking structures, providing visitors, residents, and the beach-going public with easy and
12 affordable access to the City's bustling commercial core and renowned Third Street Promenade. It
13 not only provides the City of Santa Monica with a constant source of revenue (approximately
14 $750,000.00 annually), but also supplies local businesses, many of which have no (or limited) on-
15 site parking, with essential spaces to directly serve their customers and employees.

16 39. Parking Structure #3 was also an important part of the redevelopment strategy for
17 downtown Santa Monica in the late 1980s. Originally a two-way driving street, Third Street
18 Promenade was transformed in 1989 into the City's outdoor, pedestrian-only commercial
19 thoroughfare by relocating parking in newly constructed garage structures directly east and west of

20 the Promenade. Having abundant public parking nearby was one of the motivating factors for the
21 property owners to assess themselves and agree to pay for the renovation of the Promenade. Now,
22 the City unilaterally and indiscriminately seeks to change the successful urban design of the
23 Promenade by removing 337 critical parking spaces.

24 The City Proposes Demolishing Parking Structure #3 Under the Guise of an Affordable Housing Project 25

26 40. Although the six-story, 150,000 square foot parking facility site has been the
27 subject of various, private redevelopment proposals over the years, no formal or explicit action has
28• been taken by the City to demolish the structure itself. The latest proposal, initiated by the City in
SANTA MONICA_PWM.6,15.21 11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
TNITIAIOTID DET TOO

1 late 2018, called for the replacement of Parking Structure #3 with a mixed-use affordable housing
2 project, including permanent supportive housing, and possibly ground-floor commercial uses. In

3 April 2019, the City Council approved release of a Request for Proposals ("RFP") for the
development of affordable housing on the site, and authorized staff to continue to explore similar
5 opportunities on other Citÿ-owned properties. The RFP process, which concluded in November
6 2019, failed to meet its objective, and no developer was selected by the City.
41. Concurrent with the RFP process, on July 23, 2019, the City Council approved an
8 item on the consent calendar' to award a $176,000 contract to Walter P. Moore and Associates,

9

ERVIN COHEN & JESSUP LAP 4 Inc. (the only proposer) to prepare plans, specifications, and cost estimates for the "Parking
10 Structure #3 Demolition Project". In its staff report, the City acknowledged that the only prior
11 action taken by the City Council was the April 9, 2019 authorization of the affordable housing
12 RFP. At no time did the City publicly authorize, or solicit input on, the independent demolition of
13 Parking Structure #3.

14

15 The City Quietly Applies to the California Coastal Commission for a Coastal Development Permit

16 42. In late April 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and after several
17 months of inaction and no public discussion or engagement with the community about Parking
18 Structure #3, the City stealthily submitted an application to the Commission for a Coastal
19 Development Permit ("CDP Application") to demolish the building. The City's project description
20 stated plainly: "Demolishing of the existing parking structure, capping all utility lines at the
21 property line, paving the lot or installing crushed rock flush with the adjacent properties, drainage
22 control (if required), chain link fencing around the property". Specifically, the project included the
23 permanent removal of 337 parking spaces through the demolition of the six-story, 150,000 square
24| foot concrete building (the "Project").
25

26

27 As is the City's practice, items on the consent calendar are approved in a single motion by the City Council. The only opportunity for any public discussion on a consent calendar item occurs when a Councilmember "pulls an 28 |item" for discussion. This item was not "pulled", and therefore approved without any comment or debate.
SANTA MONICA_PWM.6.15.21 12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
TNITTINATIVE DRT TRR

43. As part of its CDP Application, the City submitted the requisite Local Agency
2 Review Form claiming the project does not require a documented CEQA analysis, but rather is
a 3 subject to a "statutory exemption Section 21080(b)(1) ministerial action". The City made this bare

4 assertion without offering any supporting narrative or analysis, applicable regulations or

5 ordinances, or documents justifying the statutory exemption.

6 44. The CDP Application also included a set of undated plans by Walter P. Moore and
7 Associates, Inc., the City's Contractor, which documented the proposed demolition. The plans also

8 included an Urban Runoff Drainage Plan Worksheet (but only one of the two pages), as required
by the City. In response to six preliminary questions, the Contractor acknowledged that the project
§ dUdnssar  NEHOO NIAdE 10 would have impacts to urban runoff. Per the worksheet, answering yes to any of these questions
11 requires mitigation. Because the proposed Project will result in 30,000 square feet of impervious
12 area, the City is required to mitigate 1,875 cubic feet of runoff. Under the City's formula, the in
:13 lieu fee is calculated as $106,872.94. This mitigation was neither cited in the City's Local Agency
14 Review Form for its CEQA analysis, nor mentioned in the Commission's Staff Report, dated April
15 23, 2021.

16 45. On May 26, 2020, Commission staff provided the City with a Notice of Incomplete
17 Application, indicating that "the project appears to be inconsistent with the public access policies
18 of the Coastal Act because no information has been provided to demonstrate that there is sufficient
19 public access/public parking without this structure." The City had submitted with its original
20 application a copy of the Downtown Parking Program Update from July 21, 2009. Commission
21 staff required the City to prepare and submit a new parking study that included: (1) Existing
22 demand and use of the Parking Structure #3 and other public parking within a 3-block radius for
23 summer and winter, (2) all historical parking surveys for Parking Structure #3, (3) any available
24 historical parking surveys for the surrounding area within 3 blocks of the structure, and (4) a
25 parking analysis of the City's Coastal Zone demonstrating that the City's parking demand is
26 adequately met with the proposed demolition and that the demolition of this structure will not
27 adversely impact public access.

46. The City Submits a Deficient Parking Study With a New Project Scope
In response to the Commission's request, the City submitted a parking study
("Parking Study") dated October 9, 2020 by Walker Consultants purporting to analyze the
adequacy of the parking supply in downtown Santa Monica and the Coastal Zone if Parking
5 Structure #3 were demolished. In this study, the City represented to the Commission for the first

6

7 time that it "plans to demolish PS3 to provide affordable housing, including supportive housing,
with possible small scale, ground floor commercial uses." The Parking Study offered no details,
8 Il information of analysis about the scope and nature of the anticipated mixed-use affordable housing

8 9 project (e.g., number and size of dwelling units, type and size of commercial uses, number of

7 ERVIN COHEN 'dnssar: 10 parking spaces, etc.). Instead, it speculated, without any articulated basis, that "future
11 development on the site is anticipated to generate nominal parking demand, be self-parked, or
12 both" and made what it called "a reasonable assumption that the commercial space would be
13 locally serving for the local pedestrian traffic and not destination commercial uses that would
14 generate a material number of additional parked cars, if any." The Parking Study was thus
15 deficient on its face.

16 47. The Parking Study also relied exclusively on data provided to Walker Consultants
17 by the City, including information regarding public parking inventory, occupancy, and utilization
18 between April 2018 and March 2020. The Parking Study concluded that despite the fact that
19 Parking Structure #3 was one of the highest utilized structures of a dozen in the downtown area,
20 the loss of the facility's 337 parking spaces could be adequately absorbed by the other city
21 facilities. In reaching this conclusion, the Parking Study, did not examine or analyze the proximity

22 or accessibility of these other facilities to the users of Parking Structure #3 or the Project's
23 potential impacts to traffic, circulation, or other land use considerations as a result of the reduced
24 parking capacity at this particular location.

25

26. 48. The Commission Questions the City's Project Scope and Description
Not until November 16, 2020 did the Commission deem the City's CDP
27 Application complete. In fact, even after the Commission staff's determination, it raised questions
28 about the City's deliberate "unbundling" of the proposed demolition from the anticipated mixed-
SANTA MONICA_PWM.6.15.21 14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INITNGTIVR RRT IRR

2 use affordable housing project. City conveniently did not disclose to the Commission that the RFP

3 process had concluded 12 months earlier, and no developer was actually selected by the City.
49. In response to the Commission's concern about the actual scope of the Project, the
City offered the following:

5

6 "The parking structure is over 60 years and is at critical point in its serviceable Life.

7 Within the next year or two, the structure would require significant capital investment to
remain functional and open. Considering that selecting a developer for the housing project

9 and entering into an agreement with them could take 2-3 years, the City was faced with the

à 10 decision of using its limited capital to demolish the structure, or invest in the capital

ERVIN COHEN & JESSUPL 3 11 upgrades. However, knowing that within 2-3 years a developer will begin working on the

12 housing project, investing in the structure did not make financial sense. The City would

13 have spent $2-3M to keep the structure open for an additional year or So, only to have it
torn down by the developer.

14

15 Further, the City has undertaken a Request for Proposals process to select a developer for

16 the future affordable housing development intended for the site. The RFP indicated that the

17 demolition of the parking garage would be undertaken by the City and the site would be

18 delivered to the developer as unimproved. Obtaining a 'clean' site is an important aspect

19 of redeveloping the site, as developers need to demonstrate 'site control'when competing

20 for affordable housing financing administered by the State. A site with an existing multi-

21 story parking structure represents too much uncertainty with respect to demolition period

22 and soils testing and therefore constrains the feasibility of redeveloping the

23 site. Additionally, when funding is awarded for a development, most public funding

24 programs (such as the California Tax Credit Allocation Committee program) have strict

25 deadlines for completing construction, which would not be able to accommodate the time

26 period associated with demolition of the existing parking structure, which is estimated to

27 take up to a year. Therefore, decoupling the demolition of the parking structure from the

28 construction of the new affor dable housing facilitates the financial feasibility of new
development.

After selecting a developer, it's the City's intention that the housing project commence as
close to completion of the demolition project as possible." (emphasis added).

50. As noted above, the City misrepresented that its search for a developer of a mixed-
use affordable housing project was current, when in fact its RFP had already been

6 conducted and no developer had come forward and selected. In fact, at the time it

7 submitted the CDP Application, the City had no viable, defined mixed-use affordable

8 housing project, no identified (let alone contracted) developer, no financial commitment
for any proposed housing project, and no demonstrated urgency to proceed with the
proposed demolition.

11 The Commission Approves CDP Application Over the Objections of Individuals,

12 Residents, and Businesses

51.

6% On May 13, 2021, at its regular monthly meeting, the Commission conducted a
13 public hearing on the City's CDP Application (Application No. 5-20-0248) to demolish Parking
14 Structure #3. In addition to the Petitioner, several individuals, Santa Monica residents, and local
15 business owners voiced their opposition to the demolition of Parking Structure #3 noting, among
16 other things, that the proposed Project failed to comply with CEQA, was inconsistent with the
17 Coastal Act, and unfairly and unnecessarily impacted local businesses. The few individuals who
18 expressed support for the CDP Application only commented on the potential provision of
19 affordable housing. Despite the overwhelming public opposition, and no discussion of the
20 apparent deficiencies of the Project's CEQA analysis, the Commission approved the CDP
21 Application. On June 7, 2021, the City filed a Notice of Exemption with the State's CEQA
22 .Clearinghouse and Office of the Los Angeles County Recorder, noting the exemption pursuant to
23 Section 21080(b)(1) and Section 15268 because "The project involved demolition of parking
24 structure #3, which is a ministerial action undertaken by the City."

25 52. Because of the City's deficient Application pursuant to CEQA, and Commission's
26 improper approval of the CDP Application, Petitioner has no choice but to seek relief by filing the
27 instant Petition and Complaint. The harm facing Petitioner, as well as other business and property
28  owners located within close walking distance of Parking Structure #3, employees of those

1 businesses, and visitors to the Third Street Promenade and downtown coastal area is irreparable
2 and substantial given that the City intends to demolish all 337 spaces immediately with no
3 replacement parking for the businesses and people who rely heavily on it daily. Furthermore,
4 although Petitioner and other Santa Monica residents and business owners stated their concerns

5 regarding key environmental issues - such as air quality concerns from the substantial amounts of
6 dust that will be generated by the demolition; the possible lack of mitigation of other
7 environmental contaminants (one of which is mentioned as probable in the City's Parking Study,

8 but not actually studied); the undeniable effect of traffic congestion in the surrounding area due to
the unmitigated, sudden loss of a heavily used parking garage and presumed redirection of traffic
B d'dssar 9 NEHOO NIAX3 10 to other parking sites; and the lack of any information whatsoever regarding the intended
11 development of the site after Parking Structure #3 is demolished - neither the City nor the
12 Commission bothered to address any of these issues.

13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation of California Environmental Quality Act 14 Public Resources Code § 21080(b)(1), California Code of Regulations §15268 and §15369 -
Statutory Exemption for Ministerial Action) 15

16 53. Petitioner incorporates herein by reference all the allegations contained in
17 Paragraphs 1 through 52.

18 54.. In California Code of Regulations Section 15000-15387 ("State CEQA
19 Guidelines), Section 15378 defines a "Project" as "the whole of an action, which has a potential
20 for resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or reasonably foreseeable
21 indirect physical change in the environment, and that is any of the following:

22 (1) An activity directly undertaken by any public agency including but not limited to

23 public works construction and related activities clearing or grading of land, improvements

24 to existing public structures, enactment and amendment of zoning ordinances, and the

25 adoption and amendment of local General Plans or elements thereof pursuant to

26 Government Code Sections 65100-65700.

27 (2) An activity undertaken by a person which is supported in whole or in part through

28 public agency contracts, grants, subsidies, loans, or other forms of assistance from one or
SANTA MONICA_PWM.6.15.21 17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
ININ INOVFTUE DRI IRR

more public agencies.
(3) An activity involving the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate, or
other entitlement for use by one or-more public agencies.

55. In Public Resources Code Section 21080, CEQA sets forth certain statutory
exemptions for projects. In particular, Section 21080(b)(1) provides an exemption for "Ministerial

6 projects proposed to be carried out or approved by public agencies."

7 56. In California Code of Regulations Sections 15000-15387 ("State CEQA
8 Guidelines"), Section 15369 defines "ministerial" as "a governmental decision involving little or
no personal judgment by the public official as to the wisdom or manner of carrying out the

9 10 project...A ministerial act or decision involves only the use of fixed standards or objective
JESSUP 11 measurements, and the public official cannot use personal, subjective judgment in deciding
12 whether or how the project should be carried out. Common examples of ministerial permits
0D
NIHOO NIAR3 13 include automobile registrations, dog licenses, and marriage licenses."

14 57. Section 15268 further clarifies the nature and scope of ministerial projects:

15 "(a) Ministerial projects are exempt from the requirements of CEQA. The determination of

16 what is "ministerial" can most appropriately be made by the particular public agency

'17 involved based upon its analysis of its own laws, and each public agency should make such

18 determination either as a part of its implementing regulations or on a case-by-case basis. a

19 (b) In the absence of any discretionary provision contained in the local ordinance or other

20 law establishing the requirements for the permit, license, or other entitlement for use, the

21 following actions shall be presumed to be ministerial:

22 (1) Issuance of building permits.

23 (2) Issuance of business licenses.

24 (3) Approval of final subdivision maps.

25 (4) Approval on individual utility service connections and disconnections.

26 (c) Each public agency should, in its implementing regulations or ordinances, provide an

27 identification or itemization of its projects and actions which are deemed ministerial under

28 the applicable laws and ordinances.
SANTA MONICA_PWM.6.15.21 18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND
INTI IMATIVR RRI TAR

(d) Where a project involves an approval that contains elements of both a ministerial action
and a discretionary action, the project will be deemed to be discretionary and will be
subject to the requirements of CEQA."

58.

5 At the agency's regular meeting on May 13, 2021, the Commission approved the
City's CDP Application, which included a Local Agency Review Form claiming the Project does
6 not require a documented CEQA analysis, but rather is subject to a "statutory exemption Section
7 21080(b)(1) ministerial action". The City made this bare assertion without offering any supporting

8 analysis, applicable regulations or ordinances, or documents justifying the statutory exemption. In

ERVIN z COHEN & JESSUP LLP fact, the City has no approved implementing regulations or ordinances that identify or itemize
10 certain projects or actions as ministerial, let alone the subject (i.e., demolition) of the CDP
11 Application.

12 59. The activity cited by the City-demolition of Parking Structure #3-unequivocally
13 constitutes a "Project" under CEQA. The proposed public works project involves the complete
14 removal of an existing, 150,000 square foot concrete parking structure and clearing of the 30,000
15 square foot property, which will have a direct physical change in the environment. Even the City's
16 anticipated replacement of Parking Structure #3-the construction of an undefined mixed-use
17 affordable housing project with ground-floor commercial uses-represents a "Project" under
18 CEQA, too.

19 60. As the lead agency initiating the proposed Project, the City undeniably has the
20 ability to plan, design, and execute a demolition project at its own discretion. Indeed, it hired a
21 civil engineer to create demolition plans based on its own specifications and subjective judgment.
22 Because the City could shape the proposed Project in any way-there are no demonstrated fixed
23 standards or objective measurements to be applied-the ministerial statutory exemption is not
24 applicable. Furthermore, the Commission failed to provide any supporting findings, and City did
25 not supply any to support its determination that the proposed Project was eligible as a statutory
26 exemption.

27 61. Therefore, the City's use of the statutory exemption under §21081(b)(1) is clearly
28 improper, and the Commission's approval of the CDP Application and CEQA exemption must be
SANTA MONICA_PWM.6.15.21 19

TAITTINATYUR DRT TRE

set aside pursuant to Government Code Section 1094.5.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

(Violation of California Environmental Quality Act Public Resources Code §21065,

62. California Code of Regulations §15378 - Piecemealing of Project)
Petitioner incorporates herein by reference all the allegations contained in
6 Paragraphs 1 through 61.

7 63. In Public Resources Code Section 21065, CEQA defines "Project" as "any
8 activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably

ERVIN 5 COHEN & JESSUP ULP 10 foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment, and which is
(a) An activity directly undertaken by any public agency. any of the following:

11

12 (b) An activity undertaken by a person which is supported, in whole or in part, through

13 contracts, grants, subsidies, loans, or other forms of assistance from one or more public
agencies.

14

15 (c) An activity that involves the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate,

16 or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies."

64. State CEQA Guidelines §15378(a) reiterates this definition, and notes at the outset
17 that a "Project means the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct
18 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the
19 environment...". Accordingly, Piecemealing, or segmenting, a proposed project into smaller parts
20 to avoid a comprehensive environmental review is prohibited under CEQA.

21 65. The City's CDP Application initially described the Project as "Demolishing of the
22 existing parking structure, capping all utility lines at the property line, paving the lot or installing
23 | crushed rock flush with the adjacent properties, drainage control (if required), chain link fencing
24 around the property". Later, after the City submitted an updated parking study as required by the
25 Commission staff, the City revealed the actual Project scope by acknowledging that the purpose of
26 the proposed demolition was to clear the site for an anticipated, but undefined and unfunded,
27 mixed-use affordable housing project.

28 ///
SANTA MONICA_PWM.6.15.21 20

INITT NIOTIVP RRT TRR

1 66.

2 On its own, the City's proposed demolition of the 6-story, 150,000 square foot
concrete structure will unequivocally cause a direct physical change in the environment. Given the
3 fact that the City's true objective is to build an affordable housing development in place of

4

5 Parking Structure #3, the development is a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the initial

6 demolition, and therefore together constitutes the "whole of the action". Because the actual Project
necessarily involves the anticipated, mixed-use affordable housing development, the City's
7 environmental analysis requires proper consideration of its potential impacts as prescribed by
8 CEQA. No such analysis was conducted by either the City or the Commission.

9 67.

ERVIN COHEN & JESSUP LLP Therefore, the City's deliberate unbundling of the demolition from the ultimate
10 development of a mixed-use affordable housing project constitutes "piecemealing" in violation of
11 CEQA §21065 and State CEQA Guidelines §15378, and the Commission's approval of the CDP
12 Application on this basis also violates CEQA and must be set aside pursuant to Government Code
13 Section 1094.5.

14 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Injunction Relief)

16 (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 526, 526a)

68.

17 Petitioner incorporates herein by reference all the allegations contained in
Paragraphs 1 through 1 67.
18 69.

19 Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA's requirements has caused, and
threatens to cause, Petitioner and its members irreparable and substantial harm by permitting the
20 construction of the Project when its approvals do not conform or satisfy the legal requirements.
21 The laws that are violated by the approval of the CDP Application are intended to protect the
22 environment and the City's infrastructure, and to ensure the orderly functioning of the City's land
23

24 use planning process. So long as the approvals for the demolition of Parking Structure #3 remain

25 in effect, Petitioner and the public at large are injured by the flouting of these laws.

70. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law, in that unless
26 Respondents are enjoined by this Court to rescind the CDP approval, the demolition of Parking
27 Structure #3 will go forward with unmitigated environmental impacts during construction and
28 after the site has been razed. No amount of money or other legal remedy can adequately

the irreparable harm that they will suffer from the violations of law described herein.

and contends, for the reasons set forth above, that Respondents' actions as set forth above, were

for the demolition of a six-story, 150,000 square-foot parking garage with 337 spaces used for
visitor-serving vehicle parking ("Parking Garage #3) that is located at 1318-3120 Fourth Street in
Santa Monica.
Please take notice pursuant to Section 21167 of the Public Resources Code as weli as
Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, that SMBOA intends to include a cause of action under
the provisions of CEQA against the City and the Commission. The lawsuit will challenge, among other things, the City's decision to approve the project without preparation of any

Re: Notice of Intent to Commence CEQA Action
Santa Monica Bayside Owners Association v. City of Santa Monica; California Coastal Commission

Dear Attorney General Bonta:
Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388,
Santa Monica Bayside Owners Association ("SMBOA") hereby gives notice that on June 16, 2021, a
verified petition for writ of mandate and complaint will be filed against Defendants and Respondents
the City of Santa Monica and the California Coastal Commission(collectively, "Respondents") in Santa
