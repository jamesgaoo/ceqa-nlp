2 Introduction

3 Petitioner City of Hesperia (the "City") seeks a writ of mandate to prevent a

4 Respondent Lake Arrowhead Community Services District (the "District")1 from building
5
a
6 solar energy project on land the District owns in an area of the City known as

7 Hesperia Farms. The City contends the project violates the City's general plan and
zoning ordinances. The District, however, contends it is statutorily exempt from

9 compliance pursuant to Government Code section 53096, subdivision (a), which

10 provides an exemption for projects related to the "storage or transmission" of electricity
11

12 when there is "no feasible alternative."

13 The project is intended to generate electricity pursuant to the Local Government

14 Renewable Energy Self-Generation Bill Credit Transfer program ("RES-BCT"),2 which

15 allows local governments, under specified circumstances, to generate electricity on one
16 site, export it to the electrical grid, and apply the resulting energy credits against
17

18 electricity bills incurred on a different site. a (Pub. Util. Code, § 2830.) To comply with

19 the requirement for exemption from the City's general plan and zoning ordinances, the

20 District determined that there is "no feasible alternative" to the Hesperia Farms site,

21 because other sites would not be suitable for the District's intended purpose
22

23 generating electricity under the RES-BCT program.

24

25

26

27

28 The Board of Directors of Lake Arrowhead Community Service District is named as an additional
respondent.

2 The acronym RES-BCT is used with due respect to Aretha Franklin and her anthem, RESPECT.

1 A. The Original Tentative Ruling

2 The court's tentative ruling, filed July 12, 2021, was to grant the City's petition on
3

4 the ground that the District's premise underlying the selection of the site in Hesperia

5 Farms-that the site qualified for the RES-BCT program-was mistaken. The court

6 tentatively found that the site did not qualify for the program because it is not located
"within the geographical boundary" of the District, as required by section 2830,
subdivision (a)(4)(C). Although other sites were infeasible because they were unusable

10 for the RES-BCT program, or for other reasons, the court determined that this site was

11 also infeasible because it was not within the geographical boundary of the District.

12 Therefore, the court tentatively found that the statutory exemption from the City's
13 general plan and zoning ordinances did not apply. Accordingly, the court's original
14 tentative ruling was to grant the City's petition for a writ of mandate.3 After oral
15

16 argument, however, the court continued the hearing to allow further briefing on several

17 issues.

18 B. The Revised Ruling After Further Briefing and Argument

19

20 The parties submitted supplemental briefing, and the court a held a further hearing

21 on September 3, 2021. With one exception, the additional arguments are unpersuasive

22 for a different ruling from the tentative. As explained below, however, the court finds
23 that the City is barred by the doctrine of laches from relying on an argument that the site
24

25 does not qualify for the RES-BCT program. Accordingly, the court's ruling is to deny the

26 petition.

27

28 3 Other grounds for the petition were denied. While the tentative ruling's conclusion on stated that the petition was denied, the caption properly reflected a tentative decision to page 33 erroneously grant based on the RES-BCT
issue.

2 Background

3 A. The Former Version of the Project

5 In 2016, the City brought a similar writ petition challenging an earlier decision by

6 the District to approve a similar solar project in the same general area. (City of
Hesperia v. Lake Arrowhead Community Services District et al., San Bernardino County
Superior Court Case No. CIVDS1602017.) As in this case, the City contended that the

10 project did not comply with the City's general plan and zoning ordinances. Also as in

11 the case, the District contended that the project was statutorily exempt from compliance.

12 The trial court agreed with the City and granted the petition. The Court of Appeal

13 affirmed the judgment in City of Hesperia v. Lake Arrowhead Community Services

14 District (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 734, finding that the project was not exempt from the
15

16 City's general plan and zoning ordinances.

17 The Court of Appeal began its analysis with the observation that "the Legislature

18 has attempted to achieve a balance between the state's interest in allowing local

19 agencies to produce, generate, store, and transmit water or electrical energy and the
20 cities' and counties' control over local building and zoning." (City of Hesperia, supra, at
21

22 p. 739.) The specific issue before the Court was whether the District's solar project
23 was "exempt from-or whether the District must comply with-the zoning ordinances" of
24 the City. (Ibid.) The Court summarized the statutory scheme, which balances the

25 competing interests:
26

27 Our analysis begins with the statutory requirement that, for purposes of a proposed solar energy project, a local agency

28 must comply with the zoning ordinances of the city and county in which the project's facilities are to be constructed

- 3 -

or located. (Gov. Code, § 53091, subd. (a) ....) Then, as potentially applicable here, section 53091, subdivision (e)
2 (§ 53091(e)), and section 53096, subdivision (a) (§ 53096(a)), each provides the agency with an exemption
3 for the location and construction of certain types of

4 facilities. Section 53091(e) provides an absolute exemption for "the location or construction of facilities for

5 the production or generation of electrical energy" -unless the facilities are "for the storage or transmission of electrical
6 energy," in which event the zoning ordinances apply. Section

7 53096(a) provides a qualified exemption for an agency's proposed use upon, first, a showing that the development is for facilities "related to storage or transmission of water or

9 electrical energy" and, second, a resolution by four-fifths of the agency's members that "there is no feasible alternative to
10 [the agency's] proposal."

11 (City of Hesperia, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at pp. 739-740, italics in original.)

12 Although the parties agreed that the project qualified as a solar farm under
13 Hesperia Municipal Code ("HMC") section 16.16.063, which addresses "[a]lternative
14

15 energy technology standards," the zoning of the property presented an obstruction.

16 HMC section 16.16.063.B, provides:

17 Solar farms shall only be allowed on nonresidential and

18 nonagricultural designated properties with approval of a conditional use permit by the planning commission. Solar
19 farms shall not be permitted within six hundred sixty (660) feet of a railway, spur, any interstate, highway, or major
20 arterial, arterial, or secondary arterial roadway; or any

21 agricultural or residentially designated property.

22 (AR 76:6892, italics added.)

23 The property where the District intended to build the project was zoned "Rural

24 Residential," and the solar project was to be located within 660 feet of property to the
25

26 south, zoned for agricultural use. (City of Hesperia, supra, at pp. 741-742.) Therefore,

27 the project was prohibited under HMC section 16.16.063.B, unless an exemption
28 applied-either the absolute exemption under Government Code section 53091,

- 4.

1 subdivision (e), or the qualified exemption under Government Code section 53096,

2 subdivision (a).

3 Attempting to address this problem, the District adopted a Resolution determining

4 that the project met the criteria for both the absolute exemption and the qualified
5 exemption. First, the District found that the absolute exemption applied because the
6

7 a District was a generator of electricity. Second, the District found that the qualified
8 exemption applied because there was "no feasible alternative" to the location of the

9 project. (City of Hesperia, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at pp. 743-744.)
10 The City sued and the trial court found that the proposed project did not fall within
11

12 the absolute exemption, because the project included the transmission of electrical
13 energy, which is excluded from the exemption provided by section 53091, subdivision

14 (e), for generation or production of electrical energy. The trial court also found that the

15 qualified exemption based on infeasibility was not supported by substantial evidence.
16 Therefore, the trial court found that the project was not exempt from the City's general
17

18 plan and zoning ordinances.

19 The District appealed.

20 In 2017, the parties agreed to stay the appeal while the District applied for a

21 General Plan Amendment to change the land use designation of Hesperia Farms to
22

23 Public (i.e., not Rural Residential) and for approval of a Conditional Use Permit ("CUP")

24 to construct a solar farm on the property. (AR 4:20-21; AR 36:2568-2569; AR 44:3121-
25 3123.) The project was the same as the original version except for moving it 660 feet to
26 the north to comply with HMC section 16.16.063.B (prohibiting solar projects within 660

27 feet of property zoned for agricultural use). If the City granted the District's application,
28 the issues on appeal would be moot and the project could go forward.

- 5.

On January 16, 2018, however, the City denied the District's applications and on
March 20, 2018, adopted Resolution No. 2018-09, denying the General Plan
3 Amendment, and adopted Resolution No. 2018-10, denying the CUP. (AR 51:4160; AR

4 61:4292-4296; AR 62:4297-4300.)
5

6 The District did not challenge the City's denials. Instead, the appeal proceeded,

7 resulting in the City of Hesperia decision in favor of the City, filed July 19, 2019.4

8 The appellate court affirmed the trial court's ruling that the proposed project did

9 not fall within the absolute exemption because the project included the transmission of

10 electrical energy. (City of Hesperia, supra, at pp. 740, 749-759.) The appellate court
11

12 also affirmed the trial court's conclusion that the proposed project did not fall within the
13 qualified exemption, because substantial evidence did not support the District's
14 conclusion that there was "no feasible alternative" to the location chosen for the project.

15 (City of Hesperia, supra, at pp. 740, 760-766.) In determining feasibility, the Court
16 found guidance in the application of feasible alternatives and feasible mitigation
17

18 measures in the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section

19 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"). (City of Hesperia, supra, at pp. 762-764, 767.)

20 B. The Current Version of the Project

21

22 Shortly after the appellate court issued its ruling, the District arranged for
23 consultants to prepare two technical reports, which had not been prepared for the

24 original project. The first was entitled RES-BCT Project Review (the "Sage Report").

25 The second was entitled Technical Memorandum for Feasibility Evaluation of Potential
26 Photovoltaic System Sites (the "Tidewater Memorandum"). Based on these studies, the
27

28 The appeal considered the project as originally conceived, located within 660 feet of agriculturally designated property. (City of Hesperia, supra, at p. 742.)

- 6-

District's staff prepared a report entitled "Alternatives to Proposed Solar Photovoltaic

2 System on Hesperia Farms Property (the "Alternatives Report").

3 On June 23, 2020, the District held a public hearing on the solar project as it was

4 described in the earlier General Plan and CUP applications, which the City had denied.
5 The District then adopted Resolution 2020-04, finding that there is no feasible
6

7 alternative to the proposed project, pursuant to the qualified exemption of Government

8 Code section 53096. (AR 3:11-14.) The Resolution stated:

9 The District's determination is based on [the] Alternatives

10 Report, including but not limited to the Tidewater Memorandum and the Sage Report, and the remaining
11 administrative record for such determination, the District's approval of the Original Site, and the District's approval of 12 the Alternative Site (the Proposal).

13 (Id. at p. 12.) The Resolution found that the District's determination rendered the City's
14

15 general plan and zoning ordinances inapplicable based on the newly supported

16 qualified exemption. (Ibid.)

17 The City, however, contends that the District's determination that it is statutorily

18 exempt from compliance with the City's general plan and zoning ordinances is still
19 invalid because the site does not qualify for the RES-BCT program and because the
20

21 District's determination is unsupported by substantial evidence in other respects as well.

2 The City's Argument that the Project Does not Qualify

3 for the RES-BCT Program is Barred by the Doctrine of Laches.5

4 A. Unreasonable Delay and Prejudice Supports the District's Laches Defense.
5 The District asserts that laches bars the City's challenge to its right to use the
6

7 Hesperia Farms property under the RES-BCT program. It argues that it is prejudiced by

8 the City's five-year delay in asserting that the site does not qualify for the RES-BCT

9 program because the District incurred substantial financial resources and further delay
10 in considering alternative project sites under Government Code section 53096. The
11

12 District reasonably believed that if it satisfied the alternatives if analysis, the project could

13 be built. In support, the District cites the June 2020 report that the District made

14 reasonable efforts to reach a resolution with the City regarding the project. (AR 4:20-

15 21.) It also cites the Tidewater Cost Proposal that discloses $14,874.80 was spent on

16 Tidewater's feasibility analysis. (AR 90:7656-7659.)
17

18 The City argues that it submitted a comment letter before the June 2020 hearing

19 on the solar project and timely filed its challenge. Therefore, the City argues, the suit

20 a was not a surprise and there was no unreasonable delay in taking legal action. It also

21 contends that there is no prejudice because after the appellate decision, the District still
22

23 needed to comply with the City's zoning or conduct an alternatives analysis. Therefore,

24 there was no material change in the status quo. Finally, it argues that the mere
25 expenditure of money or effort is insufficient to show prejudice.

26

27 The court's analysis of the RES-BCT program, absent the application of laches, is set forth in the court's
28 original tentative ruling. The court has not altered its opinion of the statutory requirements for the program as set forth in the tentative ruling. (Tent. Ruling, pp. 8-11.) Rather, the court simply finds that the City cannot challenge it at this late stage.

- 8 -

"A plaintiff who has unduly delayed seeking equitable relief to the prejudice of a
2 defendant may be barred by the doctrine of laches. Administrative mandamus is a
3 proceeding in which equitable principles are applicable and in which the defense of

4 laches may be invoked. Laches is ordinarily a question of fact, and the trial court
5 exercises considerable discretion in deciding whether the defense should be sustained.
6

7 (Concerned Citizens of Palm Desert V. Bd. of Supervisors (1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 257,

8 265, citations omitted.)

9 It is well-established doctrine that the defense of laches does
10 not rest entirely upon lapse of time, nor require any specific period of delay, as does the statute of limitations. In order to
11 constitute laches, there must be something more than mere

12 delay by the plaintiff, accompanied by an expenditure of money or effort on the part of the defendant. It must also
13 appear that it will be inequitable to enforce the claim. "The
reason upon which the rule is based is not alone the lapse of
14 time during which the neglect to enforce the right has

15 existed, but the changes of condition which may have arisen during the period in which there has been neglect." It is said
16 that the cases on the subject "proceed on the assumption that the party to whom laches is imputed has knowledge of
17 his rights and an ample opportunity to establish them in the

18 proper forum; that by reason of his delay the adverse party has good reason to believe that the alleged rights are
19 worthless or have been abandoned; and that, because of the change in conditions during this period of delay, it would be
20 an injustice to the latter to permit the" claimant now to assert

21 his rights. The acquiescence which will bar a complainant from the exercise in his favor of the discretionary jurisdiction
22 by injunction must be such as proves his assent to the acts

23 of the defendant, and to the injuries to himself which have flowed, or can reasonably be anticipated to flow, from those

24 acts."

25 (Verdugo Canon Water Co. V. Verdugo (1908) 152 Cal. 655, 674-675, citations omitted.)

26 In Holt v. County of Monterey (1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 797, at issue was a

27 development that developers first applied for in January 1975. The county approved the
28 specific plan for the project in January 1977. In June 1979, plaintiff filed his lawsuit after

the county granted the use permit and approval of the tentative subdivision map in

2 March 1979. Plaintiff sought to have the specific plan adopted in 1977, and the more

3 recent approvals set aside based on the county's failure to establish an adequate

4 general plan. The Court noted that during the period between the January 1977
5

6 approval and the June 1979 lawsuit, the developers had expended over $4 million in

7 development costs in reliance on the county's earlier approval of the plan. It affirmed

8 the trial court's finding of laches in which the trial court found: (1) plaintiff knew of the
9  project as early as 1976, (2) the delay of over two and one-half years before instituting
10 the lawsuit was unreasonable, and (3) the developers substantially and justifiably relied
11

12 to their detriment on the adoption of the specific plan. (Id. at pp. 799-801.)

13 When the circumstances of the history of the project, including the prior litigation,
14 are considered, the City has unreasonably delayed raising the issue that the Hesperia

15 Farms site does not qualify for the RES-BCT program to the prejudice of the District.
16

17 The City was aware of the District's intent to proceed under the RES-BCT

18 program to construct the solar project on the Hesperia Farms site since at least

19 November 18, 2014, when District staff met with the City Manager and the Planning

20 Department to discuss the solar facility. (AR 4:19.) In August 2015, the District entered

21 into the agreement with Southern California Edison (SCE) to export electricity energy
22

23 under the RES-BCT program. (AR 26:1777-1838.) In December 2015, the District

24 determined it qualified for the absolute exemption under Government Code section
25 53091, and the project fell within the qualified exemption under section 53096. The City

26 filed suit in February 2016. (AR 4:19-20.) The history of that litigation is detailed in this

27 Ruling and the Tentative Ruling, attached as Exhibit A for reference. The 2016 action,
28

- 10 -

despite settlement attempts, continued until July 19, 2019, when the appellate court
issued its decision. (AR 4:20.)
Although the specific issue of the site's eligibility was not raised to the trial court,

4 the City was aware of the issue and could have raised it as evidenced by it its argument
5

6 submitted on appeal. (AR 64:4390-4391.) In its opposition to the District's appeal, the

7 City asserted that the District's project does not fall within the scope of the RES-BCT

8 program because the solar farm is not within the geographical boundaries of the District.

9 (AR 64:4390-4391.) On reply, the District argued that the City was raising this issue for

10 the first time on appeal. (AR 65:4434-4435.) The appellate decision did not discuss the
11

12 City's eligibility argument.6

13 The City argues here that there was no material change in the status quo
14 because the District still needed to conduct the alternative analysis. But the City offers

15 no explanation for the delay in raising the eligibility issue that could have been raised
16 and addressed as part of the 2016 litigation. The trial court's decision in the 2016 action
17

18 noted that the City did not offer any argument that the project did not satisfy the

19 requirements of the RES-BCT program under Public Utilities Code section 2830. (City's

20 RJN Exh. B, pp. 5-6.)

21 By failing to raise the issue earlier, the District has been prejudiced in treating the
22

23 solar project under the RES-BCT program at the Hesperia Farms site as feasible, with

24 the only issue being whether substantial evidence supported a finding that there was
25 "no feasible alternative" to that location under Government Code section 53096.

26

27

28 The general rule is that issues raised for the first time on appeal are deemed waived, which rule the appellate court has discretion to apply. (Franz v. Board of Medical Quality Assurance (1982) 31 Cal.3d 124, 143; Redevelopment Agency v. City of Berkeley (1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 158, 167.)
11 -

Therefore, the court finds that the City's argument that the District is ineligible for

2 the RES-BCT program, while based on correct statutory interpretation, is barred by the

3 doctrine of laches.7

4 IV

5 The City's Other Grounds for Challenging
6

7 the Feasibility Finding are Unsupported.

8 A. City of Hesperia Requires a Consideration of Alternative Locations.

9 As discussed above, Government Code section 53091, subdivision (a), provides:
10

11 "Each local agency shall comply with all applicable building ordinances and zoning

12 ordinances of the county or city in which the territory of the local agency is situated."

13 Also discussed above, Government Code section 53096, subdivision (a), provides a
14 qualified exemption for a local agency's a use of property for facilities "related to storage
15 or transmission of ... electrical energy" when there is no "feasible alternative."
16

17 City of Hesperia considered CEQA as "guidance" for analyzing the definition of

18 "feasible" in section 53096, subdivision (c), given the lack of other authority.8 (City of
19 Hesperia, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at p. 762.) Under CEQA, "[t]he range of alternatives is
20 governed by the "rule of reason," which requires only an analysis of those alternatives
21 necessary to permit a reasoned choice. An [environmental impact report] need not
22

23 consider an alternative, the effect of which cannot be reasonably ascertained and the

24 implementation of which is remote and speculative.™ (Id. at p. 763, quoting Citizens of

25

26 The District also argues that collateral estoppel applies. But the issue whether the Hesperia Farms property qualified for the RES-BCT program under Public Utilities Code section 2830 was never litigated before the trial court.
27 was raised on appeal, but was not addressed by the appellate court. The District failed to present sufficient argument to demonstrate that collateral estoppel applies.
28 8 "Feasible" means "capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time, taking into account economic, environmental, social, and technological factors." (Gov. Code, § 53096, subd. (c).)
- 12 -

Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 1167, 1177-1178, fn.

2 omitted in original.)

3 As under CEQA, for purposes of section 53096, the "rule of reason' requires

4 I consideration of alternatives." (Ibid.) City of Hesperia found:
5 For section 53096(a)'s qualified exemption to apply, section
6 53096, subdivision (c)'s definition of "feasible" requires the

7 necessary finding to be there is no alternative to the agency's proposal that is "capable of being accomplished in
8 a successful anner within a reasonable period of time"; and

9 that necessary finding must be supported by substantial evidence of the "economic, environmental, social, and

10 technological factors."

11 (City of Hesperia, supra, at p. 764.) The court stated:

12 [I]n order for the District to have properly determined that
13 "there is no feasible alternative" to the proposed location of the Solar Project for purposes of section 53096(a), the
14 District was required to have: (1) considered alternative

15 locations; (2) taken into account economic, environmental, social, and technological factors associated with both the
16 Project Site and the alternative locations; and (3) determined--i.e., exercised discretion based on substantial
17 evidence in the administrative record-that, at the alternative

18 locations, the proposal was not capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable
19 period of time.

20 (ld. at p. 767.) Therefore, under City of Hesperia, this is the standard to apply when

21 determining whether substantial evidence supports the District's feasibility finding.9
22 B. The District's Purpose in Choosing the Project Site is Irrelevant.
23

24 In City of Lafayette v. East Bay Municipal District (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1005,

25 1017, the Court wrote:

26

27 The District's argument that "even under CEQA an agency is not required to provide the public with an 28 opportunity to review and comment or debate an agency's economic feasibility analysis" (Opp. Br. p. 21:7-9, citing Sierra Club v. County of Napa (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 1490, 1505-1506), is irrelevant. Government Code section 53096, subdivision (a), requires a public hearing with at least ten days' notice.

• 13 -

The primary objective of the statutory scheme is to maintain local control of land use decisions (§ 53091), with carefully

2 specified exceptions where necessary to further countervailing interests.
3

4 (Italics added.)10

5 Relying on Lafayette, the City argues that the project does not "further
6 countervailing interests" such as placing water or electricity facilities that are necessary

7 and indispensable to the agency's authorized functions, because the District's purpose
8

9 in building the project is merely to reduce its own electricity costs.

10 This argument directed to the agency's purpose was previously rejected in City of
11 Hesperia in connection with the Court's discussion of the absolute exemption. The

12 Court found, contrary to the City's argument, that the exemption is based "on the
13 purpose of the proposed facilities, not ... on the purpose of the agency developing the
14

15 proposed facilities." (City of Hesperia, supra, at p. 755, italics in original; footnote

16 omitted.) The City argued that the exemption should not apply because the project was

17 not "integral" or "directly related" to the District's authorized function to provide water

18 and wastewater treatment. The Court found this to be irrelevant to the application of the
19
absolute exemption.
20

21 The City fails to provide any different analysis for the qualified exemption that
22 would distinguish it from the argument already rejected by the Court of Appeal in

23 connection with the absolute exemption. The project is related to the transmission of

24 electrical energy to which section 53096 applies. The District's purpose for the project
25

26 is irrelevant. This ground for a writ is denied.

27

10
28 Lafayette addressed the legislative intent of the statutory scheme with respect to water. City of Hesperia found the same legislative intent when "proposed facilities are for the production or generation of electrical energy." (City of Hesperia, supra, at p. 752, italics in original.)

. 14 -

C. Procedures Under CEQA are Irrelevant to the Alternatives Analysis.

2 The City argues that the alternatives standards under CEQA, including the time
3 given to review and comment on a draft Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"), should
4

5 apply to the alternatives analysis under Government Code section 53096. This
6 argument apparently relates to a claimed procedural defect in the District's
7 proceedings that it did not proceed as it would proceed under CEQA. "Where the

8 alleged defect is that the agency has failed to proceed in the manner required by law,
9

10 the court determines de novo whether the agency has employed the correct

11 procedures, scrupulously enforcing all legislatively mandated requirements." (Chico

12 Advocates for a Responsible Economy v. City of Chico (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 839, 845,
13 citation omitted.) Therefore, this court considers the argument de novo.

14 The City has failed to demonstrate that the CEQA requirements applicable to
15

16 public notice and the notice period for review of an EIR are relevant to the notice period

17 required for a hearing on the qualified exemption under section 53096. Section 53096,
18 subdivision (a), sets forth the minimum public notice period of at least ten days. The

19 District complied with the notice requirement. This ground for a writ is denied.
20 D. The Methodology Employed for the Analysis of Alternatives is Not Shown
21

22 to be Inadequate.

23 Much of the City's argument about the District's feasibility determination amountsl
24 to a criticism of the parameters used in the Tidewater Memorandum, which the District's
25

26 Alternatives Report relies on. The City complains that there is no evidence of the

27 "analytic route the administrative agency traveled from evidence to action" in

28 determining why the particular sites received the particular scores they received. The

- 15 -

City complains about the twenty parameters used, asserting that they are different from

2 those used in studies of different solar projects that the Tidewater Memorandum

3 referenced as a basis for the parameters. It argues that the large number of parameters

4 used by Tidewater invites and facilitates manipulation.
5

6 The City's argument is insufficient to demonstrate that substantial evidence does

7 not support the feasibility findings in light of the whole record. The City's burden is

8 discuss all relevant evidence on the issue of the feasibility findings and to demonstrate

9 that substantial evidence does not support the District's findings in light of the whole
10 record. (Latinos Unidos de Napa V. City of Napa (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 192, 206.)11
11

12 Concerning judicial review of administrative findings on feasible alternatives, the

13 Court in City of Hesperia wrote:

14 "The reviewing court, like the trial court, may not reweigh the

15 evidence, and is "bound to consider the facts in the light
most favorable to the Board, giving it every reasonable
16 inference and resolving all conflicts in its favor."" There is a

17 presumption that the agency's findings are supported by substantial evidence; and since the party challenging those

18 findings has the burden of demonstrating otherwise, here the City must establish that the administrative record does not
19 contain substantial evidence to support the Board's finding that there is no feasible alternative to the Project Site.
20

21 (City of Hesperia, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at p. 761, citations omitted.) This standard
22 applies with equal force to this case.

23 While the City complains about the Tidewater parameters used for environmental

24 and technical criteria and the scoring, it does not provide any reason for the court to
25

26 11 "[S]ubstantial evidence has been defined in two ways: first, as evidence of *ponderable legal significance

27 reasonable in nature, credible, and of solid value' [citation]; and second, as "relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion" [citation]." (County of San Diego v. Assessment Appeals Bd. No. 2 (1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 548, 555.) "WJhen applying the substantial evidence test, 'Courts may reverse an
28 agency's decision only if, based on the evidence before the agency, a reasonable person could not reach the conclusion reached by the agency.' [Citation.] (Italics in original.)" (Greenebaum v. City of L.A. (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 391, 401-402.)

- 16 -

conclude that deviation from other studies' methodologies was without any foundation,

2 not credible, or unreasonable. The City argues that Tidewater did not provide any
support for its scoring and weight methodology, but the City fails to discuss the

4 analytical route taken by Tidewater in choosing the parameters that were evaluated and
5

6 the basis for assigning the scoring ranges for particular parameters, and weighing

7 factors as it did. (AR 4:54-59.)12

8 The City also fails to address the Tidewater discussion that subjective weighting

g factors were determined according to relative importance for a successful system

10 location. The Tidewater Memorandum explained that the reason "technical parameters"
11

12 were given the largest weighted factor was the ability to produce the requisite, annual
13 electrical output needed for a viable system. (AR 4:42, 61.)

14 In making its arguments, the City also fails to discuss all the relevant evidence on

15 which the District's findings rely, including the RES-BCT Project Review prepared by
16 Sage Energy Consulting, Inc. (AR 4:634-635, 637.)13
17

18 12 The Tidewater Memorandum evaluated the following criteria for a solar system producing similar quantities of electricity as the previously approved system: economic, environmental, social, and technical. Within each criteria, 19 specific parameters were established. (AR 4:54-59.) For example, "technical" included parameters such as shading, elevation, and average annual cloudy days. (AR 4:54.) With respect to elevation, the Tidewater Memorandum
20 provided the following discussion:

21 Atmosphere thickness and composition influence the availability of both short and longwave energy of the sun and earth, respectively. The lower the elevation

22 of a region from sea level, the greater the atmosphere thickness; therefore, a PV system's site location with respect to elevation influence the system efficiency (Noorollahi et al., 2016). Those site locations located at less than 2,500 feet
23 amsl were assigned a value of 0. Those site locations ranging from 2,500 to 5,000 feet amsl were assigned a value of 5, and those site locations greater than
24 5,000 amsi were assigned a value of 10. (AR 4:58.)

13
25 Sage evaluated six possible sites for location of solar systems consistent with the District's goal to offset electrical costs. It also reviewed the project proposal at Hesperia Farms, "including the impact of the changes in the
26 RES-BCT tariff on the projected savings in electrical costs over the life of the Project." (AR 4:634.) In doing so, it "evaluated the amount of RES-BCT bill credits generated and associated Benefiting Account credit capacity." (Ibid.)

27 Sage also considered different systems, including "wind speed data for potential wind energy systems in the area of [the District's] potential project sites.' (lbid.) It did so in relation to the District's intent to proceed with a project to "offset the electrical energy cost of the operation of their water treatment, pumping, and management facilities."
28 (Ibid.) Sage discussed the reasons that other systems, such as a wind energy, were not feasible. (AR 4:634-635.) Sage also reviewed the Tidewater Memorandum and found that it adequately identified potential RES-BCT project sites. (AR 4:637.)

- 17 -

The District's report provided a detailed discussion of its investigation of

2 renewable energy options "to offset costs and energy requirements associated with
3 current and projected water and wastewater demands." (AR 4:17-22.) Evaluation was

4 based on project objectives related to substantially offsetting existing and future
5

6 electricity costs. (AR 4:16, 22-23.) The District considered other alternative forms of

7 renewable energy, including solar thermal, hydroelectric energy, wind, geothermal, and
8 digester gas, and provided reasons for selecting solar technology and rejecting other

9 alternatives based on the project objective to substantially offset existing and future
10 electricity costs. (AR 4:29-32.)
11

12 The District considered the following alternatives: no project, reapplying to the

13 City for approval of the project, and alternative locations. (AR 4:32-42.) The District
14 provided a reasoned discussion and analysis why the "no project" and "re-apply"

15 proposals were determined infeasible in terms of the project objectives. (AR 4:32-34.)
16 For example, with the re-apply option, the District discussed that an alternative must be
17

18 "*capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of
19 | time" and, given the history of the project, every indication was that a new application to

20 the City would be denied and a waste of further time and resources. (AR 4:34, quoting

21 Gov. Code § 53096, subd. (c).) Substantial evidence supports the District's conclusion.
22

23 In considering alternative sites, the District discussed the feasibility of acquiring

24 new sites and evaluated the use of other existing sites. (AR 4:35-42.) Its analysis,
25 including a discussion of the findings in the Tidewater Memorandum and Sage Report,

26 concluded that there was no feasible alternative that met the project objective to

27 substantially reduce the District's existing and future energy costs within a reasonable
28 period. (AR 4:35-42.) The analytical route for the conclusion was provided. The City's

. 18 -

attacks on the Tidewater parameters are insufficient to demonstrate that substantial

2 evidence does not support the District's feasibility finding, assuming that the project

3 qualifies for the RES-BCT program.

4 The City also argues that the Tidewater analysis did not take into account the
5

6 new analysis of the Mojave River Dam by the Army Corps. of Engineers. But the City

7 failed to present this evidence at the public hearing. There is no basis to take judicial

8 notice of this document, and the City did not move to augment the administrative record

9 to include it. Therefore, the City's argument on this issue is disregarded.
10 The City asserts that the Sage report's economic analysis of the different sites
11

12 fails to show how the comparison numbers were set and why size limitations were

13 placed on alternatives. The City takes issue that the alternative at "the Flats" site is

14 sized smaller at roughly one third the size of the proposed project even though the Flats

15 is a 4.45-acre site. (Reply, pp. 5:16-6:7.)
16 The District has not had an opportunity to respond, because the City first raised
17

18 the argument in its Reply brief. Nevertheless, the argument does not demonstrate that
19 substantial evidence fails to support the District's findings. Five acres is minimum

20 acreage for the proposed project. (AR 4:37, 47.) The Flats site is 4.45 acres. (AR

21 4:51.) The Sage Report discussed that to be economically viable, an RES-BCT system
22

23 needs to be at least 350 kW DC and requires 3.0 acres. (AR 4:636.) Related to the

24 Flats, the Sage Report states:

25 Although the Flats site is currently intended for use in the

26 construction of a new operations building and yard, we evaluated it in its current condition as raw land. The Flats

27 site is not large enough to accommodate a PV system large enough to generate significant electricity cost savings. Sage
28 found that a 365 kW-DC single-axis tracking PV system at the site would provide less than $37,000 of annual savings,

- 19 -

6.5% of LACSD annual energy costs. In addition, the Flats site has potential issues with soils and interconnection that
could jeopardize the viability of the site to host solar. An

3 annotated SCE DRPEP map is shown in Figure 1 below with nearest access to distribution approximately 1/3 of a mile which would add ~$250,000 to interconnection costs, which would render the project financially unviable. Photographic
5 evidence shows a potential 12kV spur along Hospital Road to the corner of Rouse Ranch Road that is not indicated on
6 the DRPEP map. (AR 4:638.)

7 The Tidewater Memorandum discussed that the Flats site has been committed to

8 the new Field Operations Department building and corporate yard. The Flats was
9

10 included "in its current condition as existing vacant land; however, once construction

11 begins, the site would only be appropriate for potential rooftop and partial use." (AR
12 4:51.) In rejecting the Flats site as a viable alternative, the District noted that it has

13 committed the site "to its Field Operations Department building and corporate yard and
14

15 has already incurred costs in pursuit of that use." (AR 4:39.) When taken as a whole,

16 substantial evidence supports rejection of the Flats site as a feasible alternative in light

17 of project objectives.

18 Finally, the City asserts that the studies lack credibility because there was not an

19 adequate process to give the public time to review the studies and hire their own
20

21 I consultants. But the District followed the public notice hearing requirements of

22 Government Code section 53096, subdivision (a), which provides for at least ten days

23 prior notice. The City's argument about the notice period and procedures needs to be

24 addressed with the Legislature, not the court. (Estate of Horman (1971) 5 Cal.3d 62,
25
77.)
26

27

28

- 20 -

1 E. Institutional Bias as an Improper Influence is Not Shown by the Record.

2 The City contends that "institutional bias" influenced the feasibility finding,

4 because the District had an ongoing relationship with the consultant it hired to conduct

5 the analysis. But there is no basis to take judicial notice of the contracts the City relies

6 on to support this argument. The court's inquiry under Code of Civil Procedure section

7 1094.5 is limited to the administrative record. (City of Hesperia, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th

8 at p. 766.)
9

10 The City also argues that the District's decision is particularly vulnerable to

11 charges of "institutional bias" because its decision is to proceed with essentially the

12 same project that was previously struck down. Citing Residents Ad Hoc Stadium
13 Committee v. Board of Trustees of the California State University and Colleges (1979)

14 89 Cal.App.3d 274, 284, the City argues that there is a post hoc rationalization, given
15

16 that the District had spent $800,000 on the project by March 2018. (AR 63:4319.) The

17 City's institutional bias argument is speculative, not based on evidence.

18 In Residents Ad Hoc Stadium Committee, supra, 89 Cal.App.3d at p. 285, the
19 court discussed that CEQA assumes as inevitable an institutional bias within an agency

20 proposing a project, and that Public Resources Code sections 21000 and 21100 impose
21

22 procedural requirements to insure that the decision maker does not fail to note the facts

23 and understand arguments advanced by opponents. The City's argument that the

24 precise process detailed in CEQA must be followed to avoid an "institutional bias" claim

25 is without legal support. As previously explained, the requirements for the District's
26

27 feasibility consideration are set forth in City of Hesperia. The City does not provide any

28 legal analysis why the public hearing requirements of Government Code section 53096,

- 21 -

1 subdivision (a), and the procedures set forth in City of Hesperia are insufficient to

2 address "institutional bias" claims and to avoid post hoc rationalization.

3 Nothing in Government Code section 53096, subdivision (a), precludes using a
paid consultant to prepare the feasibility analysis. The administrative record
5

6 demonstrates that the District performed an independent review of the consultants'

7 reports in drafting its Alternatives Report. (AR 4:15-43.)

8 Finally, the City asserts that the self-serving nature of the studies relied on by the

9 District is demonstrated by Tidewater's introduction and background sections that

10 advocate for the site chosen in 2014. The City argues, "There is no questioning of the
11

12 analytical gaps in the facts, criteria used for comparison, and the ultimate conclusions."
13 (Opening Br. p. 16:9-10.) But the City does not provide any analysis of what statements

14 were made in the introduction and background that demonstrate "institutional bias." Its

15 conclusory argument is without support. (Citizens for Responsible Equitable
16 Environmental Development v. City of San Diego (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 515, 529
17

18 ["[A]n attack on the evidence without a fair statement of the evidence is entitled to no
19 consideration a when it is apparent that a substantial amount of evidence was received on

20 behalf of the respondent.' [Citation.]"].)

21 V

22

23 The City's CEQA Challenge is Unsupported.

24 A. Further Environmental Review is Not Required Due to Significant New

25 Information.

26 The City asserts that new information requires supplemental environmental
27

28 review under Public Resources Code section 21166 and CEQA Guidelines section

15162.

- 22 -

1 In general, once an EIR or negative declaration has been adopted for a project,

2 the lead agency is not required to prepare a subsequent or supplemental EIR unless

3 one of the following exists:

4 (a) Substantial changes are proposed in the project which
5 will require major revisions of the environmental impact
report.
6 (b) Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is being undertaken which will require major revisions in the environmental
impact report.

9 (c) New information, which was not known and could not

10 have been known at the time the environmental impact report was certified as complete, becomes available.
11 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21166; see also Guidelines, § 15162, subds. (a) and (b).)
12

13 Guidelines section 15162, subdivision (c) provides: "Once a project has been
14 approved, the lead agency's role in project approval is completed, unless further
15 discretionary approval on that project is required." The CEQA review process is not

16 complete until all discretionary approvals are granted.
17 "Whether an initial environmental document remains relevant despite changed
18

19 plans or circumstances ... is a predominately factual question" for the agency to first
20 answer. (Friends of College of San Mateo Gardens v. San Mateo County Community

21 College Dist. (2016) 1 Cal.5th 937, 953.) "A court's task on review is then to decide

22 whether the agency's determination is supported by substantial evidence; the court's job
23

24 **js not to weigh conflicting evidence and determine who has the better argument.™*

26 In 2017, in an effort to obtain the City's approval of a General Plan Amendment

27 and CUP, the proposed solar farm project was moved 660 feet north to comply with City
28 zoning requirements that preclude solar farms within 660 feet of an agricultural or

- 23 -

1 residentially designated property. (AR 41:2636-3103; AR 42:3104-3106; AR 44:3121-

2 3123; AR 48:3654-3656.) As moved, the project has the same design and layout, but

3 requires additional trenching to install electrical conduit to connect to SCE facilities. (AR
82:6966.) As part of seeking a General Plan Amendment and CUP, the District adopted

6 an Addendum to the IS/MND. (AR 42:3104-3114; 44:3122.) Under the Addendum, the

7 District found the change in the project site would not result in any new significant

8 environmental effects triggering the need for further environmental review. In August

9 2017, the District filed and posted the Notice of Determination. (AR 1:1-3; 42:3105-

10 3106.)
11

12 The current project involves essentially the same solar farm project proposed in
13 2017, with the issue being the qualified exemption under Government Code section

14 53096, subdivision (a). The District's June 2, 2020, Notice of Public Hearing stated that

15 the Board was holding a public hearing to consider adopting a Resolution that there is
16

17 no feasible alternative to the Hesperia Farms project pursuant to Government Code

18 section 53096. (AR 100:7677-7679.) The Agenda listed a similar description of the
19 public hearing related to adopting Resolution No. 2020-04. (AR 81:6961.) In the

20 District's June 2020 Resolution, the District noted that a CEQA review was completed

21 for the project in 2017. (AR 3:11-12.)
22

23 On July 2, 2020, following the feasibility hearing, the District filed and posted a

24 Notice of Determination stating that the same project approved in August 2017 was fully

25 analyzed in the prior MND and Addendum, concluding that the project would not have a

26 significant effect on the environment. (AR 2:7-9.)
27 The Staff Report regarding Resolution No. 2020-04 discussed that on August 8,
28
2017, the Board adopted Resolution No. 2017-15 approving and adopting Addendum

- 24 -

1 No. 1 to the Final MND for the alternative site under CEQA and approving the

2 alternative site. It discussed the finding that the change in location would not result in

3 any new significant environmental effect triggering the need for further environmental

4 review under Public Resources Code section 21166 or State CEQA Guidelines section

5

6 15162. It also stated that the alternative site is subject to the same mitigation measures
as the original site. (AR 82:6966.) The June 2020 Alternatives Report discussed the

8 prior environmental review process and adoption of the Addendum in 2017. (AR 4:19,
9 21.)

10 The City's comments, submitted before the public hearing, raised an issue about
11

12 the environmental document failing to address "feasible alternatives." (AR 101:7707-

13 7708.) But the City's argument in its Opening Brief is not based on the failure to

14 address alternatives as part of CEQA review. Instead, the City's challenge is based on
15 significant new information that requires further environmental review.
16 The City now claims that the District's Addendum to the MND is deficient
17

18 because it did not consider significant new information about the risk of the Mojave

19 River Dam failing. It asserts that the record lacks a discussion of this new information
20| published in November 2019, in which the Army Corps' News Release warned of

21 greater risk from the Mojave River Dam failing. The City contends the District is
22

23 proceeding in a manner not required by law because it failed to consider this new

24 information and instead relied on the 2017 Addendum.

25 The District argues that it complied with CEQA when it adopted the 2017

26 Addendum. The District contends that the City fails to demonstrate the existence of

27 "new information" under Public Recourses Code section 21166 and Guidelines section
28 15162, subdivision (a). According to the District, the City failed to exhaust its

- 25 -

1 administrative remedies; judicial notice cannot be taken of the information on which the

2 City relies; and even if the City's claim is not barred by the failure to exhaust, there are

3 no subsequent discretionary approvals to trigger CEQA review.

4 B. The City Failed to Exhaust Administrative Remedies.
5

6 The District is correct that the City failed to exhaust its administrative remedies

7 on this issue.

8 The City argues in its Reply that the District's decision to find alternatives
infeasible and approve the project under Government Code section 53096 is a

10 discretionary approval triggering the need for a CEQA determination. But this was not
11

12 the argument raised in the City's Opening Brief. The argument raised in the Opening

13 Brief was directed to asserting that the District failed to consider new significant
14 information, rendering reliance on the 2015 MND and 2017 Addendum deficient.

15 The court considers the City's argument made on reply only as it relates to the
16 District's exhaustion of administrative remedies defense. In other words, to the extent
17

18 the City asserts in its Reply that the District failed to make required CEQA findings in

19 approving the project, that argument is waived. But to the extent it is offered as a

20 reason that the significant new information argument was not raised earlier, it is

21 considered.

22

23 The 2020 approval is a discretionary approval to which CEQA applies, requiring

24 consideration whether one of the three triggering events for a supplemental or
25 subsequent EIR exists. Substantial evidence supports a conclusion that the solar

26 energy project as described and considered in the 2017 Addendum is the same project

27 approved in 2020. The only change in circumstance was the manner under which
28 project approval was sought: the District's finding that the qualified exemption under

• 26 -

1 Government Code section 53096 applied rather than the City approving the District's
2 application for a General Plan Amendment and CUP. The question then is whether the

3 "significant new information" factor of Public Resources Code section 21166,
subdivision (c), and Guidelines section 15162, subdivision (a)(3), triggers subsequent
5
CEQA review.
6
Nothing in CEQA requires an agency to make an explicit finding that the original
8 environmental document retains some degree of relevance. (San Mateo Gardens,

9 supra, 1 Cal.5th at p. 953, fn.4.) "When an agency considers a subsequent
10

11 discretionary action on a project, it will know whether changes are proposed in the

12 project but may be unaware of changes in circumstances or new information of
13 importance to the project. Nothing in CEQA or the Guidelines requires the agency to
14 conduct an investigation to ferret out changes in circumstances or new information. If

15 the agency becomes aware of such factors, however, it should then consider all the
16 relevant facts and explicitly decide whether conditions exist that necessitate further
17

18 environmental review. If a project opponent is aware of changed circumstances or new

19 information, bringing that material to the agency's attention might obligate the agency to

20 conduct an investigation to determine whether further environmental review is required.'

21 (Kostka & Zischke, Practice Under the California Environmental Quality Act (2d ed Cal
22

23 CEB) § 19.37.)

24 The District made an implied finding of no changes to the project that require
25 further environmental review under Public Resources Code section 21166. The

26 District's 2020 Alternatives Report states: "No legal challenges were filed under CEQA

27 against the Original Site or the Alternative Site where the Proposal would be located.
28

- 27 -

1 Thus, the Final MND and Addendum are presumed valid under Public Resources Code

2 sections 21080.1 and 21167.2 and State CEQA Guidelines section 15231." (AR 4:29.)

3 "CEQA does not set forth any particular procedure to support an agency's

4 decision that a new EIR [or MND] is not required. CEQA does not require an initial
5

6 study or public hearing in these circumstances." (Committee for Re-Evaluation of T-

7 Line Loop v. San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th

8 1237, 1256.) As explained in Kostka & Zischke, Practice Under the California

9 Environmental Quality Act, supra, § 19.48: ""There is no specific requirement in CEQA

10 or the CEQA Guidelines that public notice and an opportunity to comment be provided
11

12 in connection with a determination of whether a subsequent or supplemental EIR is
13 required for a project." (Citing Pub. Resources Code, § 21166; Guidelines, § 15162; A

14 Local & Regional Monitor (ALARM) v. City of Los Angeles (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1773,

15 1804 ["holding that CEQA does not require a public hearing or public comment before a
16 determination whether a subsequent a or supplemental EIR is required"]; Concerned
17

18 Citizens of South Central L.A. v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (1994) 24

19 Cal.App.4th 826, 845.)

20 In Santa Teresa Citizen Action Group V. City of San Jose (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th

21 689, 701-702, the Court found the exhaustion requirement of Public Resources Code
22

23 section 21177 did not apply where "there was no clearly defined administrative

24 procedure for petitioners to resolve their concerns about the project as it was finally
25 configured." But in several other cases, the a Court has come to a contrary conclusion.

26 (ALARM, supra, 12 Cal.App.4th at p. 1804 ["At no time during the administrative
27 process did anyone ... a suggest that a separate public hearing was required."]; Mani
28 Brothers Real Estate Group V. City of Los Angeles (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1394-

- 28 -

1 1395 [finding the exhaustion requirement applied where regularly schedule meetings

2 open to the public were held, even if not "duly noticed public hearings under CEQA"].)14

3 In Bridges v. Mt. San Jacinto Community College District (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 104,

4 117, the Court followed Mani Brothers, concluding that the CEQA exhaustion
5

6 requirement was triggered even though there was not a public hearing held under

7 CEQA, where there was a regularly scheduled meeting that was open to the public.

8 There is no dispute that a public hearing on the District's consideration of the

9 qualified exemption was posted as required. While the City argues that the District
10 failed to provide adequate notice that an environmental decision would be made, a
11

12 public hearing is not required for an implied finding of no subsequent environmental

13 review. In addition, the City was able to comment and generally asserted that the

14 CEQA document failed to address feasibility alternatives. (AR 101:7707-7708.) The

15 City had an opportunity during the administrative proceeding to raise its CEQA objection
16 that significant new information existed but failed to do so. It has failed to show CEQA's
17

18 exhaustion exception applies. This issue is barred by the failure to exhaust
19 administrative remedies.

20 C. There is No Basis for Finding the Existence of Significant New Information.

21 In Bridges, even though the Court found the failure to exhaust, the Court went on
22

23 to evaluate the merits of the CEQA claim as if exhaustion did not apply. (Bridges,

24 supra, 14 Cal.App.5th at pp. 118-126.) Here, even if the exhaustion conclusion did not
25 preclude the City's claim, the CEQA argument lacks merit.

26

27
14

28 Public Resources Code section 21177, setting forth the exhaustion requirement, provides at subdivision (e): "This section does not apply to any alleged grounds for noncompliance with this division for which there was no public hearing or other opportunity for members of the public to raise those objections orally or in writing before the approval of the project, or if the public agency failed to give the notice required by law."

. 29 -

1 First, there is no statutory basis for the City's request for judicial notice of the

2 November 2019 News Release, and the City does not explain why it failed to seek to
3 augment the administrative record prior to briefing on the merits.

4 But even if the court were to consider the News Release, it is insufficient to

5

6 trigger subsequent environmental analysis. "CEQA analysis is concerned with a
impact on the environment, rather than with the environment's impact on a 7 | project's

8 project and its users or residents." (California Building Industry Association v. Bay Area
Air Quality Management District (2015) 62 Cal.4th 369, 378.) CEQA does not require
10 analysis of the impact of existing environmental conditions on a project's future users or
11

12 residents. (ld. at p. 377.) Guidelines section 15126.2, subdivision (a), is consistent with

13 the ruling in California Building Industry Association.

14 Given that an MND is at issue, the News Release's discussion of a new

15 assessed increased risk of flooding during an extreme flood event does not constitute

16

17 substantial evidence in favor of a fair argument that a new significant environmental

18 impact from the project may occur. (San Mateo Gardens, supra, 1 Cal.5th at p. 959.)

19 The increased flood assessment risk is not new information of substantial importance
20 because it does not constitute substantial evidence that the project may exacerbate the
21 existing flooding risk. Therefore, the City's CEQA argument is without merit.

Introduction

Petitioner City of Hesperia (the "City") seeks a writ of mandate to prevent
Respondent Lake Arrowhead Community Services District (the "District")' from building

6 a solar energy project on land the District owns in an area of the City known as
Hesperia Farms. The City contends the project violates the City's general plan and

8 zoning ordinances. The District. however, contends it is statutorily exempt from
compliance pursuant to Government Code section 53096, subdivision (a), which

10 provides an exemption for projects related to the "storage or transmission" of electricity
11

12 when there is "no feasible alternative."

13 The project is intended to generate electricity pursuant to the Local Government

14 Renewable Energy Self-Generation Bill Credit Transfer program ("RES-BCT"),2 which

15 allows local governments, under specified circumstances, to generate electricity on one
16

17 site, export it to the electrical grid, and apply the resulting energy credits against

18 electricity bills incurred on a different site. (Pub. Util. Code, § 2830.) To comply with

19 the requirement for exemption from the City's general plan and zoning ordinances, the

20 District determined that there is "no feasible alternative" to the Hesperia Farms site,

21 because other sites would not be suitable for the District's intended purpose-
22

23 generating electricity under the RES-BCT program.

24

25

26

27

28 The Board of Directors of Lake Arrowhead Community Service District is named as an additional
respondent.
The acronym RES-BCT is used with due respect to Aretha Franklin and her anthem, RESPECT.

1 A. The Original Tentative Ruling

2 The court's tentative ruling, filed July 12, 2021, was to grant the City's petition on

3

4 the ground that the District's premise underlying the selection of the site in Hesperia

5 Farms-that the site qualified for the RES-BCT program-was mistaken. The court

6 tentatively found that the site did not qualify for the program because it is not located

7 "within the geographical boundary" of the District, as required by section 2830,

8 subdivision (a)(4)(C). Although other sites were infeasible because they were unusable
9

10 for the RES-BCT program, or for other reasons, the court determined that this site was

11 also infeasible because it was not within the geographical boundary of the District.
12 Therefore, the court tentatively found that the statutory exemption from the City's

13 general plan and zoning ordinances did not apply. Accordingly, the court's original
14 tentative ruling was to grant the City's petition for a writ of mandate.3 After oral
15

16 argument, however, the court continued the hearing to allow further briefing on several

17 issues.

18 B. The Revised Ruling After Further Briefing and Argument

19

20 The parties submitted supplemental briefing, and the court held a further hearing
21 on September 3, 2021. With one exception, the additional arguments are unpersuasive
22 for a different ruling from the tentative. As explained below, however, the court finds
23 that the City is barred by the doctrine of laches from relying on an argument that the site
24

25 does not qualify for the RES-BCT program. Accordingly, the court's ruling is to deny the

26 petition.

27

28 3 Other grounds for the petition were denied. While the tentative ruling's conclusion on page 33 erroneously stated that the petition was denied, the caption properly reflected a tentative decision to grant based on the RES-BCT
issue.

II

Background

A. The Former Version of the Project

In 2016, the City brought a similar writ petition challenging an earlier decision by
the District to approve a similar solar project in the same general area. (City of
Hesperia V. Lake Arrowhead Community Services District et al., San Bernardino County
Superior Court Case No. CIVDS1602017.) As in this case, the City contended that the

10 project did not comply with the City's general plan and zoning ordinances. Also as in

11 the case, the District contended that the project was statutorily exempt from compliance.

12 The trial court agreed with the City and granted the petition. The Court of Appeal

13 affirmed the judgment in City of Hesperia v. Lake Arrowhead Community Services

14 District (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 734, finding that the project was not exempt from the
15

16 City's general plan and zoning ordinances.

17 The Court of Appeal began its analysis with the observation that "the Legislature

18 has attempted to achieve a balance between the state's interest in allowing local
19  agencies to produce, generate, store, and transmit water or electrical energy and the
20

21 cities' and counties' control over local building and zoning." (City of Hesperia, supra, at

22 p. 739.) The specific issue before the Court was whether the District's solar project
23 was "exempt from-or whether the District must comply with---the zoning ordinances" of
24 the City. (lbid.) The Court summarized the statutory scheme, which balances the
25 competing interests:
26

27 Our analysis begins with the statutory requirement that, for purposes of a proposed solar energy project, a local agency
28 must comply with the zoning ordinances of the city and county in which the project's facilities are to be constructed

- 3-

or located. (Gov. Code, § 53091, subd. (a) ....) Then, as potentially applicable here, section 53091, subdivision (e) (§ 53091(e)), and section 53096, subdivision (a) (§ 53096(a)), each provides the agency with an exemption for the location and construction of certain types of
facilities. Section 53091(e) provides an absolute exemption for "the location or construction of facilities for
the production or generation of electrical energy' -unless
the facilities are "for the storage or transmission of electrical energy," in which event the zoning ordinances apply. Section 53096(a) provides a qualified exemption for an agency's proposed use upon, first, showing that the development is for facilities "related to storage or transmission of water or electrical energy" and, second, a resolution by four-fifths of the agency's members that "there is no feasible alternative to
10 [the agency's] proposal."

11 (City of Hesperia, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at pp. 739-740, italics in original.)

12 Although the parties agreed that the project qualified as a solar farm under
13 Hesperia Municipal Code ("HMC") section 16.16.063, which addresses "[a]iternative

15 energy technology standards," the zoning of the property presented an obstruction.
16 HMC section 16.16.063.B, provides:

17 Solar farms shall only be allowed on nonresidential and

18 nonagricultural designated properties with approval of a conditional use permit by the planning commission. Solar
19 farms shall not be permitted within six hundred sixty (660)

20 feet of a railway, spur, any interstate, highway, or major arterial, arterial, or secondary arterial roadway; or any

21 agricultural or residentially designated property.

22 (AR 76:6892, italics added.)

23 The property where the District intended to build the project was zoned "Rural

24 Residential," and the solar project was to be located within 660 feet of property to the
25

26 south, zoned for agricultural use. (City of Hesperia, supra, at pp. 741-742.) Therefore,

27 the project was prohibited under HMC section 16.16.063.B, unless an exemption

28 applied-either the absolute exemption under Government Code section 53091,

1 subdivision (e), or the qualified exemption under Government Code section 53096,

2 subdivision (a).

3 Attempting to address this problem, the District adopted a Resolution determining

4 that the project met the criteria for both the absolute exemption and the qualified
5

6 exemption. First, the District found that the absolute exemption applied because the

7 District was a generator of electricity. Second, the District found that the qualified

8 exemption applied because there was "no feasible alternative" to the location of the

9 project. (City of Hesperia, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at pp. 743-744.)
10 The City sued and the trial court found that the proposed project did not fall within
11

12 the absolute exemption, because the project included the transmission of electrical
13 energy, which is excluded from the exemption provided by section 53091, subdivision

14 (e), for generation or production of electrical energy. The trial court also found that the
15 qualified exemption based on infeasibility was not supported by substantial evidence.
16

17 Therefore, the trial court found that the project was not exempt from the City's general

18 plan and zoning ordinances.

19 The District appealed.

20 In 2017, the parties agreed to stay the appeal while the District applied for a
21 General Plan Amendment to change the land use designation of Hesperia Farms to
22

23 Public (i.e., not Rural Residential) and for approval of a Conditional Use Permit ("CUP")

24 to construct a solar farm on the property. (AR 4:20-21; AR 36:2568-2569; AR 44:3121-
25 3123.) The project was the same as the original version except for moving it 660 feet to
28 the north to comply with HMC section 16.16.063.B (prohibiting solar projects within 660
27

28 feet of property zoned for agricultural use). If the City granted the District's application,
the issues on appeal would be moot and the project could go forward,

-5.

1 On January 16, 2018, however, the City denied the District's applications and on

2 March 20, 2018, adopted Resolution No. 2018-09, denying the General Plan

3 Amendment, and adopted Resolution No. 2018-10, denying the CUP. (AR 51:4160; AR

4 61:4292-4296; AR 62:4297-4300.)
5

6 The District did not challenge the City's denials. Instead, the appeal proceeded,

7 resulting in the City of Hesperia decision in favor of the City, filed July 19, 2019.4

8 The appellate court affirmed the trial court's ruling that the proposed project did

9 not fall within the absolute exemption because the project included the transmission of
10

11 electrical energy. (City of Hesperia, supra, at pp. 740, 749-759.) The appellate court

12 also affirmed the trial court's conclusion that the proposed project did not fall within the
13 qualified exemption, because substantial evidence did not support the District's
14 conclusion that there was "no feasible alternative" to the location chosen for the project.

15 (City of Hesperia, supra, at pp. 740, 760-766.) In determining feasibility, the Court
16

17 found guidance in the application of feasible alternatives and feasible mitigation

18 measures in the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section

19 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"). (City of Hesperia, supra, at pp. 762-764, 767.)

20 B. The Current Version of the Project

21

22 Shortly after the appellate court issued its ruling, the District arranged for
23 consultants to prepare two technical reports, which had not been prepared for the

24 original project. The first was entitled RES-BCT Project Review (the "Sage Report").

25 The second was entitled Technical Memorandum for Feasibility Evaluation of Potential
26

27 Photovoltaic System Sites (the "Tidewater Memorandum"). Based on these studies, the

28 The appeal considered the project as originally conceived, located within 660 feet of agriculturally designated property. (City of Hesperia, supra, at p. 742.)

- 6-

District's staff prepared a report entitled "Alternatives to Proposed Solar Photovoltaic

2 System on Hesperia Farms Property (the "Alternatives Report").
On June 23, 2020, the District held a public hearing on a the solar project as it was
described in the earlier General Plan and CUP applications, which the City had denied.

The District then adopted Resolution 2020-04, finding that there is no feasible
6

7 alternative to the proposed project, pursuant to the qualified exemption of Government

Code section 53096. (AR 3:11-14.) The Resolution stated:

9 The District's determination is based on [the] Alternatives

10 Report, including but not limited to the Tidewater Memorandum and the Sage Report, and the remaining
11 administrative record for such determination, the District's approval of the Original Site, and the District's approval of 12 the Alternative Site (the Proposal).
13 (ld. at p. 12.) The Resolution found that the District's determination rendered the City's
14

15 general plan and zoning ordinances inapplicable based on the newly supported

16 qualified exemption. (lbid.)

17 The City, however, contends that the District's determination that it is statutorily

18 exempt from compliance with the City's general plan and zoning ordinances is still
19 invalid because the site does not qualify for the RES-BCT program and because the
20

21 District's determination is unsupported by substantial evidence in other respects as well.

IlI

2 The City's Argument that the Project Does not Qualify

3 for the RES-BCT Program is Barred by the Doctrine of Laches.5

A. Unreasonable Delay and Prejudice Supports the District's Laches Defense.
5

6 The District asserts that laches bars the City's challenge to its right to use the

7 Hesperia Farms property under the RES-BCT program. It argues that it is prejudiced by

8 the City's five-year delay in asserting that the site does not qualify for the RES-BCT
program because the District incurred substantial financial resources and further delay
10

11 in considering alternative project sites under Government Code section 53096. The

12 District reasonably believed that if it satisfied the alternatives analysis, the project could

13 be built. In support, the District cites the June 2020 report that the District made

14 reasonable efforts to reach a resolution with the City regarding the project. (AR 4:20-

15 21.) It also cites the Tidewater Cost Proposal that discloses $14,874.80 was spent on
16

17 Tidewater's feasibility analysis. (AR 90:7656-7659.)

18 The City argues that it submitted a comment letter before the June 2020 hearing

19 on the solar project and timely filed its challenge. Therefore, the City argues, the suit

20 was not a surprise and there was no unreasonable delay in taking legal action. It also

21 contends that there is no prejudice because after the appellate decision, the District still
22

23 needed to comply with the City's zoning or conduct an alternatives analysis. Therefore,

24 there was no material change in the status quo. Finally, it argues that the mere

25 expenditure of money or effort is insufficient to show prejudice.

26

27 5 The court's analysis of the RES-BCT program, absent the application of laches, is set forth in the court's
28 original tentative ruling. The court has not altered its opinion of the statutory requirements for the program as set forth in the tentative ruling. (Tent. Ruling, pp. 8-11.) Rather, the court simply finds that the City cannot challenge it at this late stage.

- 8-

1 "A plaintiff who has unduly delayed seeking equitable relief to the prejudice of a

2 defendant may be barred by the doctrine of laches. Administrative mandamus is a
3 proceeding in which equitable principles are applicable and in which the defense of
laches may be invoked. Laches is ordinarily a question of fact, and the trial court
5

6 exercises considerable discretion in deciding whether the defense should be sustained.

7 (Concerned Citizens of Palm Desert v. Bd. of Supervisors (1974) 38 Cal.App.3d 257,

8 265, citations omitted.)

9 It is well-established doctrine that the defense of laches does
10 not rest entirely upon lapse of time, nor require any specific period of delay, as does the statute of limitations. In order to
11 constitute laches, there must be something more than mere

12 delay by the plaintiff, accompanied by an expenditure of money or effort on the part of the defendant. It must also
13 appear that it will be inequitable to enforce the claim. "The reason upon which the rule is based is not alone the lapse of
14 time during which the neglect to enforce the right has

15 existed, but the changes of condition which may have arisen during the period in which there has been neglect." It is said
16 that the cases on the subject "proceed on the assumption

17 that the party to whom laches is imputed has knowledge of his rights and an ample opportunity to establish them in the

18 proper forum; that by reason of his delay the adverse party has good reason to believe that the alleged rights are
19 worthless or have been abandoned; and that, because of the

20 change in conditions during this period of delay, it would be an injustice to the latter to permit the" claimant now to assert
21 his rights. The acquiescence which will bar a complainant from the exercise in his favor of the discretionary jurisdiction
22 by injunction must be such as proves his assent to the acts

23 of the defendant, and to the injuries to himself which have flowed, or can reasonably be anticipated to flow, from those
24 acts."

25 (Verdugo Canon Water Co. v. Verdugo (1908) 152 Cal. 655, 674-675, citations omitted.)

26 In Holt v. County of Monterey (1982) 128 Cal.App.3d 797, at issue was a
27 development that developers first applied for in January 1975. The county approved the
28
specific plan for the project in January 1977. In June 1979, plaintiff filed his lawsuit after

- 9.

1 the county granted the use permit and approval of the tentative subdivision map in

2 March 1979. Plaintiff sought to have the specific plan adopted in 1977, and the more

3 recent approvals set aside based on the county's failure to establish an adequate
general plan. The Court noted that during the period between the January 1977
5

6 approval and the June 1979 lawsuit, the developers had expended over $4 million in

7 development costs in reliance on the county's earlier approval of the plan. It affirmed

8 the trial court's finding of laches in which the trial court found: (1) plaintiff knew of the

9 project as early as 1976, (2) the delay of over two and one-half years before instituting
10

11 the lawsuit was unreasonable, and (3) the developers substantially and justifiably relied

12 to their detriment on the adoption of the specific plan. (ld. at pp. 799-801.)

13 When the circumstances of the history of the project, including the prior litigation,

14 are considered, the City has unreasonably delayed raising the issue that the Hesperia

15 Farms site does not qualify for the RES-BCT program to the prejudice of the District.
16

17 The City was aware of the District's intent to proceed under the RES-BCT

18 program to construct the solar project on the Hesperia Farms site since at least

19 November 18, 2014, when District staff met with the City Manager and the Planning

20 Department to discuss the solar facility. (AR 4:19.) In August 2015, the District entered

21 into the agreement with Southern California Edison (SCE) to export electricity energy
22

23 under the RES-BCT program. (AR 26:1777-1838.) In December 2015, the District

24 determined it qualified for the absolute exemption under Government Code section

25 53091, and the project fell within the qualified exemption under section 53096. The City
26 filed suit in February 2016. (AR 4:19-20.) The history of that litigation is detailed in this
27

28 Ruling and the Tentative Ruling, attached as Exhibit A for reference. The 2016 action,

- 10 -

despite settlement attempts, continued until July 19, 2019, when the appellate court

2 issued its decision. (AR 4:20.)

3 Although the specific issue of the site's eligibility was not raised to the trial court,
the City was aware of the issue and could have raised it as evidenced by its argument

6 submitted on appeal. (AR 64:4390-4391.) In its opposition to the District's appeal, the

7 City asserted that the District's project does not fall within the scope of the RES-BCT

8 program because the solar farm is not within the geographical boundaries of the District.
(AR 64:4390-4391.) On reply, the District argued that the City was raïsing this issue for
10

11 the first time on appeal. (AR 65:4434-4435.) The appellate decision did not discuss the

12 City's eligibility argument.6

13 The City argues here that there was no material change in the status quo

14 because the District still needed to conduct the alternative analysis. But the City offers

15 no explanation for the delay in raising the eligibility issue that could have been raised
16

17 and addressed as part of the 2016 litigation. The trial court's decision in the 2016 action

18 noted that the City did not offer any argument that the project did not satisfy the

19 requirements of the RES-BCT program under Public Utilities Code section 2830. (City's

20 RJN Exh. B, pp. 5-6.)
21 By failing to raise the issue earlier, the District has been prejudiced in treating the
22

23 solar project under the RES-BCT program at the Hesperia Farms site as feasible, with

24 the only issue being whether substantial evidence supported a finding that there was

25 "no feasible alternative" to that location under Government Code section 53096.

26

27

28 The general rule is that issues raised for the first time on appeal are deemed waived, which rule the appellate court has discretion to apply. (Franz v. Board of Medical Quality Assurance (1982) 31 Cal.3d 124, 143; Redevelopment Agency v. City of Berkeley (1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 158, 167.)

11•

1 Therefore, the court finds that the City's argument that the District is ineligible for

2 the RES-BCT program, while based on correct statutory interpretation, is barred by the

3 doctrine of laches.7

IV
5

6 The City's Other Grounds for Challenging
the Feasibility Finding are Unsupported.

8 A. City of Hesperia Requires a Consideration of Alternative Locations.

9 As discussed above, Government Code section 53091, subdivision (a), provides:
10

11 "Each local agency shall comply with all applicable building ordinances and zoning

12 ordinances of the county or city in which the territory of the local agency is situated."

13 Also discussed above, Government Code section 53096, subdivision (a), provides a

14 qualified exemption for a local agency's use of property for facilities "related to storage
15 or transmission of electrical energy" when there is no "feasible alternative."
16

17 City of Hesperia considered CEQA as "guidance" for analyzing the definition of

18 "feasible" in section 53096, subdivision (c), given the lack of other authority.8 (City of

19 Hesperia, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at p. 762.) Under CEQA, "[tlhe range of alternatives is
20 governed by the "rule of reason," which requires only an analysis of those alternatives
21

22 necessary to permit a reasoned choice. An [environmental impact report] need not

23 consider an alternative, the effect of which cannot be reasonably ascertained and the
24 implementation of which is remote and speculative." (ld. at p. 763, quoting Citizens of

25

26 The District also argues that collateral estoppel applies. But the issue whether the Hesperia Farms property qualified for the RES-BCT program under Public Utilities Code section 2830 was never litigated before the trial court.
27 It was raised on appeal, but was not addressed by the appellate court. The District failed to present sufficient argument to demonstrate that collateral estoppel applies.
28 8 "Feasible" means "capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time, taking into account economic, environmental, social, and technological factors." (Gov. Code, § 53096, subd. (c).)

- 12 -

1 Goleta Valley V. Board of Supervisors (1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 1167, 1177-1178, fn.

2 omitted in original.)

3 As under CEQA, for purposes of section 53096, the "rule of reason' requires
consideration of alternatives." (Ibid.) City of Hesperia found:
5

6 For section 53096(a)'s qualified exemption to apply, section 53096, subdivision (c)'s definition of "feasible" requires the
7 necessary finding to be there is no alternative to the agency's proposal that is "capable of being accomplished in
8 a successful manner within a reasonable period of time"; and
that necessary finding must be supported by substantial evidence of the "economic, environmental, social, and
10 technological factors."

11 (City of Hesperia, supra, at p. 764.) The court stated:

12 [I]n order for the District to have properly determined that
13 "there is no feasible alternative" to the proposed location of the Solar Project for purposes of section 53096(a), the
14 District was required to have: (1) considered alternative

15 locations; (2) taken into account economic, environmental, social, and technological factors associated with both the
16 Project Site and the alternative locations; and (3) determined-i.e., exercised discretion based on substantial
17 evidence in the administrative record-that, at the alternative

18 locations, the proposal was not capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable
19 period of time.

20 (ld. at p. 767.) Therefore, under City of Hesperia, this is the standard to apply when

21 determining whether substantial evidence supports the District's feasibility finding.9
22 B. The District's Purpose in Choosing the Project Site is Irrelevant.
23

24 In City of Lafayette v. East Bay Municipal District (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1005,

25 1017, the Court wrote:

26

27 The District's argument that "even under CEQA an agency is not required to provide the public with an
28 opportunity to review and comment or debate an agency's economic feasibillty analysis" (Opp. Br. p. 21:7-9, citing Sierra Club v. County of Napa (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 1490, 1505-1506), is irrelevant. Government Code section 63096, subdivision (a), requires a public hearing with at least ten days' notice.

- 13 -

The primary objective of the statutory scheme is to maintain local control of land use decisions (§ 53091), with carefully specified exceptions where necessary to further countervailing interests.
3
(Italics added.)10
Relying on Lafayette, the City argues that the project does not "further

6 countervailing interests" such as placing water or electricity facilities that are necessary
and indispensable to the agency's authorized functions, because the District's purpose
8

9 in building the project is merely to reduce its own electricity costs.

10 This argument directed to the agency's purpose was previously rejected in City of

11 Hesperia in connection with the Court's discussion of the absolute exemption. The

12 Court found, contrary to the City's argument, that the exemption is based "on the
13

14 purpose of the proposed facilities, not :.. on the purpose of the agency developing the

15 proposed facilities." (City of Hesperia, supra, at p. 755, italics in original; footnote

16 omitted.) The City argued that the exemption should not apply because the project was

17 not "integral" or "directly lated" to the District's authorized function to provide water

18 and wastewater treatment. The Court found this to be irrelevant to the application of the
19

20 absolute exemption.

21 The City fails to provide any different analysis for the qualified exemption that

22 would distinguish it from the argument already rejected by the Court of Appeal in
23 connection with the absolute exemption. The project is related to the transmission of
24 electrical energy to which section 53096 applies. The District's purpose for the project
25

26 is irrelevant. This ground for a writ is denied.

27

28 Lafeyette addressed the legislative intent of the statutory scheme with respect to water. City of Hesperia found the same legislative intent when 'proposed facilities are for the production or generation of electrical energy." (City of Hesperia, supra, at p. 752, italics in original.)

- 14 -

1 C. Procedures Under CEQA are Irrelevant to the Alternatives Analysis.

2 The City argues that the alternatives standards under CEQA, including the time
3

4 given to review and comment on a draft Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"), should

5 apply to the alternatives analysis under Government Code section 53096. This

6 a argument apparently relates to a claimed procedural defect in the District's

7 proceedings-that it did not proceed as it would proceed under CEQA. "Where the

8 alleged defect is that the agency has failed to proceed in the manner required by law,
9

10 the court determines de novo whether the agency has employed the correct

11 procedures, scrupulously enforcing all legislatively mandated requirements." (Chico

12 Advocates for a Responsible Economy v. City of Chico (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 839, 845,

13 citation omitted.) Therefore, this court considers the argument de novo.
14 The City has failed to demonstrate that the CEQA requirements applicable to
15

16 public notice and the notice period for review of an EIR are relevant to the notice period

17 required for a hearing on the qualified exemption under section 53096. Section 53096,

18 subdivision (a), sets forth the minimum public notice period of at least ten days. The

19 District complied with the notice requirement. This ground for a writ is denied.
20

21 D. The Methodology Employed for the Analysis of Alternatives is Not Shown

22 to be Inadequate.

23 Much of the City's argument about the District's feasibility determination amounts
24

25 to a criticism of the parameters used in the Tidewater Memorandum, which the District's

26 Alternatives Report relies on. The City complains that there is no evidence of the

27 "analytic route the administrative agency traveled from evidence to action" in
28 determining why the particular sites received the particular scores they received. The

- 15 •

City complains about the twenty parameters used, asserting that they are different from

2 those used in studies of fferent solar projects that the Tidewater Memorandum

3 referenced as a basis for the parameters. It argues that the large number of parameters

used by Tidewater invites and facilitates manipulation.

6 The City's argument is insufficient to demonstrate that substantial evidence does

not support the feasibility findings in light of the whole record. The City's burden is

8 discuss all relevant evidence on the issue of the feasibility findings and to demonstrate
that substantial evidence does not support the District's findings in light of the whole
10 record. (Latinos Unidos de Napa v. City of Napa (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 192, 206.)11
11

12 Concerning judicial review of administrative findings on feasible alternatives, the

13 Court in City of Hesperia wrote:

14 "The reviewing court, like the trial court, may not reweigh the

15 evidence, and is "bound to consider the facts in the light
most favorable to the Board, giving it every reasonable
16 inference and resolving all conflicts in its favor.' There is a
presumption that the agency's findings are supported by
17 substantial evidence; and since the party challenging those

18 findings has the burden of demonstrating otherwise, here the
City must establish that the administrative record does not
19 contain substantial evidence to support the Board's finding

20 that there is no feasible alternative to the Project Site.

21 (City of Hesperia, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at p. 761, citations omitted.) This standard

22 applies with equal force to this case.

23 While the City complains about the Tidewater parameters used for environmental

24 and technical criteria and the scoring, it does not provide any reason for the court to
25

26 "[Sjubstantial evidence has been defined in two ways: first, as evidence of  ponderable legal significance

27 reasonable in nature, credible, and of solid value™ [citation]; and second, as "relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion"* [citation)." (County of San Diego v. Assessment Appeals

28 Bd. No. 2 (1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 548, 555.) "hen applying the substantial evidence test, 'Courts may reverse an agency's decision only if, based on the evidence before the agency, a reasonable person could not reach the conclusion reached by the agency.' (Citation.] (Italics in original.)" (Greenebaum v. City of L.A. (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 391, 401-402.)

- 16 -

1 conclude that deviation from other studies' methodologies was without any foundation,

2 not credible, or unreasonable. The City argues that Tidewater did not provide any

3 support for its scoring and weight methodology, but the City fails to discuss the

4 analytical route taken by Tidewater in choosing the parameters that were evaluated and
5

6 the basis for assigning the scoring ranges for particular parameters, and weighing

7 factors as it did. (AR 4:54-59.)12

8 The City also fails to address the Tidewater discussion that subjective weighting

9 factors were determined according to relative importance for a successful system
10

11 location. The Tidewater Memorandum explained that the reason "technical parameters"

12 were given the largest weighted factor was the ability to produce the requisite, annual

13 electrical output needed for a viable system. (AR 4:42, 61.)

14 In making its arguments, the City also fails to discuss all the relevant evidence on

15 which the District's findings rely, including the RES-BCT Project Review prepared by
16

17 Sage Energy Consulting, Inc. (AR 4:634-635, 637.)13

18 12 The Tidewater Memorandum evaluated the following criteria for a solar system producing similar quantities of electricity as the previously approved system: economic, environmental, social, and technical. Within each criteria, 19 specific parameters were established. (AR 4:54-59.) For example, "technical" Included parameters such as shading,|

20 elevation, and average annual cloudy days. (AR 4:54.) With respect to elevation, the Tidewater Memorandum provided the following discussion:

21 Atmosphere thickness and composition influence the availability of both short
and longwave energy of the sun and earth, respectively. The lower the elevation

22 of a region from sea level, the greater the atmosphere thickness; therefore, a PV system's site location with respect to elevation influence the system efficiency (Noorollahl et al., 2016). Those site locations located at less than 2,500 feet
23 amsl were assigned value of 0. Those site focations ranging from 2,500 to 5,000 feet amsl were assigned a value of 5, and those site locations greater than
24 5,000 amsi were assigned a value of 10. (AR 4:58.)

13
25 Sage evaluated six possible sites for location of solar systems consistent with the District's goal to offset electrical costs. It also reviewed the project proposal at Hesperia Farms, "including the impact of the changes in the RES-BCT tariff on the projected savings in electrical costs over the life of the Project. (AR 4:634.) In doing so, it 26 "evaluated the amount of RES-BCT bill credits generated and associated Benefiting Account credit capacity." (Ibid.)

27 Sage also considered different systems, including "wind speed data for potential wind energy systems in the area of [Ihe District's) potential project sites." (Ibid.) It did so in relation to the District's intent to proceed with a project to

28 *offset the electrical energy cost of the operation of their water treatment, pumping, and management facilities." (Ibid.) Sage discussed the reasons that other systems, such as wind energy, were not feasible. (AR 4:634-635) Sage also reviewed the Tidewater Memorandum and found that It adequately identified potential RES-BCT project sites. (AR 4:637.)

2 renewable energy options "to offset costs and energy requirements associated with

4 based on project objectives related to substantially offsetting existing and future
5

6 electricity costs. (AR 4:16, 22-23.) The District considered other alternative forms of

7 renewable energy, including solar thermal, hydroelectric energy, wind, geothermal, and

8 digester gas, and provided reasons for selecting solar technology and rejecting other

alternatives based on the project objective to substantially offset existing and future
10 electricity costs. (AR 4:29-32.)
11

12 The District considered the following alternatives: no project, reapplying to the

13 City for approval of the project, and alternative locations. (AR 4:32-42.) The District

14 provided a reasoned discussion and analysis why the "no project" and "re-apply"

15 proposals were determined infeasible in terms of the project objectives. (AR 4:32-34.)
16

17 For example, with the re-apply option, the District discussed that an alternative must be

18 "capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of

19 time"" and, given the history of the project, every indication was that a new application to
20 the City would be denied and a waste of further time and resources. (AR 4:34, quoting

21

22 Gov. Code § 53096, subd. (c).) Substantial evidence supports the District's conclusion.

23 In considering alternative sites, the District discussed the feasibility of acquiring

24 new sites and evaluated the use of other existing sites. (AR 4:35-42.) Its analysis,
25 including a discussion of the findings in the Tidewater Memorandum and Sage Report,
26 concluded that there was no feasible alternative that met the project objective to
27

28 substantially reduce the District's existing and future energy costs within a reasonable
period. (AR 4:35-42.) The analytical route for the conclusion was provided. The City's

- 18 -

1 attacks on the Tidewater parameters are insufficient to demonstrate that substantial

2 evidence does not support the District's feasibility finding, assuming that the project

3 qualifies for the RES-BCT program.
The City also argues that the Tidewater analysis did not take into account the
5

6 new analysis of the Mojave River Dam by the Army Corps. of Engineers. But the City

7 failed to present this evidence at the public hearing. There is no basis to take judicial

8 notice of this document, and the City did not move to augment the administrative record

9 to include it. Therefore, the City's argument on this issue is disregarded.

10

11 The City asserts that the Sage report's economic analysis of the different sites

12 fails to show how the comparison numbers were set and why size limitations were

13 placed on alternatives. The City takes issue that the alternative at "the Flats" site is

14 sized smaller at roughly one third the size of the proposed project even though the Flats

15 is a 4.45-acre site. (Reply, pp. 5:16-6:7.)
16

17 The District has not had an opportunity to respond, because the City first raised

18 the argument in its Reply brief. Nevertheless, the argument does not demonstrate that

19 substantial evidence fails to support the District's findings. Five acres is minimum

20 acreage for the proposed project. (AR 4:37, 47.) The Flats site is 4.45 acres. (AR
21

22 4:51.) The Sage Report discussed that to be economically viable, an RES-BCT system

23 needs to be at least 350 kW DC and requires 3.0 acres. (AR 4:636.) Related to the

24 Flats, the Sage Report states:

25 Although the Flats site is currently intended for use in the

26 construction of a new operations building and yard, we
evaluated it in its current condition as raw land. The Flats

27 site is not large enough to accommodate a PV system large

28 enough to generate significant electricity cost savings. Sage found that a 365 kW-DC single-axis tracking PV system at the site would provide less than $37,000 of annual savings,

19 •

6.5% of LACSD annual energy costs. In addition, the Flats site has potential issues with soils and interconnection that could jeopardize the viability of the site to host solar. An

3 annotated SCE DRPEP map is shown in Figure 1 below with nearest access to distribution approximately 1/3 of a mile which would add ~$250,000 to interconnection costs, which would render the project financially unviable. Photographic evidence shows a potential 12kV spur along Hospital Road
to the corner of Rouse Ranch Road that is not indicated on
the DRPEP map. (AR 4:638.)
The Tidewater Memorandum discussed that the Flats site has been committed to

8 the new Field Operations Department building and corporate yard. The Flats was

10 included "in its current condition as existing vacant land; however, once construction

11 begins, the site would only be appropriate for potential rooftop and partial use." (AR

12 4:51.) In rejecting the Flats site as a viable alternative, the District noted that it has

13 committed the site "to its Field Operations Department building and corporate yard and
14

15 has already incurred costs in pursuit of that use." (AR 4:39.) When taken as a whole,

16 substantial evidence supports rejection of the Flats site as a feasible alternative in light

17 of project objectives.

18 Finally, the City asserts that the studies lack credibility because there was not an

19 adequate process to give the public time to review the studies and hire their own
20

21 consultants. But the District followed the public notice hearing requirements of

22 Government Code section 53096, subdivision (a), which provides for at least ten days

23 prior notice. The City's argument about the notice period and procedures needs to be

24 addressed with the Legislature, not the court. (Estate of Horman (1971) 5 Cal.3d 62,
25
77.)
26

E. Institutional Bias as an Improper Influence is Not Shown by the Record.

The City contends that "institutional bias" influenced the feasibility finding,
because the District had an ongoing relationship with the consultant it hired to conduct

5 the analysis. But there is no basis to take judicial notice of the contracts the City relies

6 on to support this argument. The court's inquiry under Code of Civil Procedure section

7 1094.5 is limited to the administrative record. (City of Hesperia, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th

8 at p. 766.)

10 The City also argues that the District's decision is particularly vulnerable to

11 charges of "institutional bias" because its decision is to proceed with essentially the

12 same project that was previously struck down. Citing Residents Ad Hoc Stadium

13 Committee v. Board of Trustees of the Califomia State University and Colleges (1979)
14 89 Cal.App.3d 274, 284, the City argues that there is a post hoc rationalization, given
15

16 that the District had spent $800,000 on the project by March 2018. (AR 63:4319.) The

17 City's institutional bias argument is speculative, not based on evidence.

18 In Residents Ad Hoc Stadium Committee, supra, 89 Cal.App.3d at p. 285, the

19 court discussed that CEQA assumes as inevitable an institutional bias within an agency
20 proposing a project, and that Public Resources Code sections 21000 and 21100 impose
21

22 procedural requirements to insure that the decision maker does not fail to note the facts

23 and understand arguments advanced by opponents. The City's argument that the

24 precise process detailed in CEQA must be followed to avoid an "institutional bias" claim

25 is without legal support. As previously explained, the requirements for the District's
26

27 feasibility consideration are set forth in City of Hesperia. The City does not provide any

28 legal analysis why the public hearing requirements of Government Code section 53096,

- 21 -

subdivision (a), and the procedures set forth in City of Hesperia are insufficient to
2 address "institutional bias" claims and to avoid post hoc rationalization.

3 Nothing in Government Code section 53096, subdivision (a), precludes using a
paid consultant to prepare the feasibility analysis. The administrative record
5

6 demonstrates that the District performed an independent review of the consultants'

7 reports in drafting its Alternatives Report. (AR 4:15-43.)

8 Finally, the City asserts that the self-serving nature of the studies relied on by the

9 District is demonstrated by Tidewater's introduction and background sections that

10 advocate for the site chosen in 2014. The City argues, "There is no questioning of the
11

12 analytical gaps in the facts, criteria used for comparison, and the ultimate conclusions."

13 (Opening Br. p. 16:9-10.) But the City does not provide any analysis of what statements
14 were made in the introduction and background that demonstrate "institutional bias." Its

15 conclusory argument is without support. (Citizens for Responsible Equitable
16

17 Environmental Development v. City of San Diego (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 515, 529

18 ['[A]n attack on the evidence without a fair statement of the evidence is entitled to no
19 consideration when it is apparent that a substantial amount of evidence was received on

20 behalf of the respondent.' [Citation.)"].)

21 V
22

23 The City's CEQA Challenge is Unsupported.

24 A. Further Environmental Review is Not Required Due to Significant New

25 Information.

26 The City asserts that new information requires supplemental environmental
27

28 review under Public Resources Code section 21166 and CEQA Guidelines section

15162.

- 22 -

1 In general, once an EIR or negative declaration has been adopted for a project, a

2 the lead agency is not required to prepare a subsequent or a supplemental EIR unless

3 one of the following exists:

4 (a) Substantial changes are proposed in the project which
5 will require major revisions of the environmental impact
report.
6 (b) Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is being undertaken

8 which will require major revisions in the environmental
impact report.
9 (c) New information, which was not known and could not

10 have been known at the time the environmental impact report was certified as complete, becomes available.
11 (Pub. Resources Code, § 21166; see also Guidelines, § 15162, subds. (a) and (b).)
12

13 Guidelines section 15162, subdivision (c) provides: "Once a project has been
14 approved, the lead agency's role in project approval is completed, unless further

15 [ discretionary approval on that project is required." The CEQA review process is not

16 complete until all discretionary approvals are granted.
17
"Whether an initial environmental document remains relevant despite changed
18

19 plans or circumstances ... is a predominately factual question" for the agency to first

20 answer. (Friends of College of San Mateo Gardens v. San Mateo County Community

21 College Dist. (2016) 1 Cal.5th 937, 953.) "A court's task on review is then to decide

22 whether the agency's determination is supported by substantial evidence; the court's job
23

24 "Üs not to weigh conflicting evidence and determine who has the better argument."

25 [Citation.]" (lbid.)

26 In 2017, in an effort to obtain the City's approval of a General Plan Amendment

27 and CUP, the proposed solar farm project was moved 660 feet north to comply with City
28 zoning requirements that preclude solar farms within 660 feet of an agricultural or

- 23 -

residentially designated property. (AR 41:2636-3103; AR 42:3104-3106; AR 44:3121-

2 3123; AR 48:3654-3656.) As moved, the project has the same design and layout, but

3 requires additional trenching to install electrical conduit to connect to SCE facilities. (AR
82:6966.) As part of seeking a General Plan Amendment and CUP, the District adopted
5

6 an Addendum to the IS/MND. (AR 42:3104-3114; 44:3122.) Under the Addendum, the

7 District found the change in the project site would not result in any new significant

8 environmental effects triggering the need for further environmental review. In August

9 2017, the District filed and posted the Notice of Determination. (AR 1:1-3; 42:3105-

10 3106.)
11

12 The current project involves essentially the same solar farm project proposed in
13 2017, with the issue being the qualified exemption under Government Code section
14 53096, subdivision (a). The District's June 2, 2020, Notice of Public Hearing stated that

15 the Board was holding a public hearing to consider adopting a Resolution that there is
16
no feasible alternative to the Hesperia Farms project pursuant to Government Code
17

18 section 53096. (AR 100:7677-7679.) The Agenda listed a similar description of the

19 public hearing related to adopting Resolution No. 2020-04. (AR 81:6961.) In the
20 District's June 2020 Resolution, the District noted a that a CEQA review was completed

21 for the project in 2017. (AR 3:11-12.)
22

23 On July 2, 2020, following the feasibility hearing, the District filed and posted a

24 Notice of Determination stating that the same project approved in August 2017 was fully
25 analyzed in the prior MND and Addendum, concluding that the project would not have a

26 significant effect on the environment. (AR 2:7-9.)

27 The Staff Report regarding Resolution No. 2020-04 discussed that on August 8,
28
2017, the Board adopted Resolution No. 2017-15 approving and adopting Addendum

- 24 •

1 No. 1 to the Final MND for the alternative site under CEQA and approving the

2 alternative site. It discussed the finding that the change in location would not result in

3 any new significant environmental effect triggering the need for further environmental
review under Public Resources Code section 21166 or State CEQA Guidelines section

6 15162. It also stated that the alternative site is subject to the same mitigation measures{
as the original site. (AR 82:6966.) The June 2020 Alternatives Report discussed the

8 prior environmental review process and adoption of the Addendum in 2017. (AR 4:19,

9 21.)

10 The City's comments, submitted before the public hearing, raised an issue about
11

12 Ithe environmental document failing to address "feasible alternatives." (AR 101:7707-

13 7708.) But the City's argument in its Opening Brief is not based on the failure to

14 address alternatives as part of CEQA review. Instead, the City's challenge is based on

15 significant new information that requires further environmental review.
16

17 The City now claims that the District's Addendum to the MND is deficient

18 because it did not consider significant new information about the risk of the Mojave

19 River Dam failing. It asserts that the record lacks a discussion of this new information
20 published in November 2019, in which the Army Corps' News Release warned of

21 greater risk from the Mojave River Dam failing. The City contends the District is
22

23 proceeding in a manner not required by law because it failed to consider this new

24 information and instead relied on the 2017 Addendum.

25 The District argues that it complied with CEQA when it adopted the 2017

26 Addendum. The District contends that the City fails to demonstrate the existence of

27 "new information" under Public Recourses Code section 21166 and Guidelines section
28
15162, subdivision (a). According to the District, the City failed to exhaust its

• 25 -

1 administrative remedies; judicial notice cannot be taken of the information on which the

2 City relies; and even if the City's claim is not barred by the failure to exhaust, there are

3 no subsequent discretionary approvals to trigger CEQA review.
B. The City Failed to Exhaust Administrative Remedies.
5

6 The District is correct that the City failed to exhaust its administrative remedies

7 on this issue.

8 The City argues in its Reply that the District's decision to find alternatives

9 infeasible and approve the project under Government Code section 53096 is a
10

11 discretionary approval triggering the need for a CEQA determination. But this was not

12 the argument raised in the City's Opening Brief. The argument raised in the Opening

13 Brief was directed to asserting that the District failed to consider new significant
14 information, rendering reliance on the 2015 MND and 2017 Addendum deficient.

15 The court considers the City's argument made on reply only as it relates to the
16

17 District's exhaustion of administrative remedies defense. In other words, to the extent

18 the City asserts in its Reply that the District failed to make required CEQA findings in
19 approving the project, that argument is waived. But to the extent it is offered as a

20 reason that the significant new information argument was not raised earlier, it is

21 considered.

22

23 The 2020 approval is a discretionary approval to which CEQA applies, requiring

24 consideration whether one of the three triggering events for a supplemental or

25 subsequent EIR exists. Substantial evidence supports a conclusion that the solar
26 energy project as described and considered in the 2017 Addendum is the same project
27 approved in 2020. The only change in circumstance was the manner under which
28
project approval was sought: the District's finding that the qualified exemption under

- 26 -

Government Code section 53096 applied rather than the City approving the District's

2 application for a General Plan Amendment and CUP. The question then is whether the

3 "significant new information" factor of Public Resources Code section 21166,

4 subdivision (c), and Guidelines section 15162, subdivision (a)(3), triggers subsequent
5
CEQA review.
6

7 Nothing in CEQA requires an agency to make an explicit finding that the original
8 environmental document retains some degree of relevance. (San Mateo Gardens,

9 supra, 1 Cal.5th at p. 953, fn.4.) "When an agency considers a subsequent
10

11 discretionary action on a project, it will know whether changes are proposed in the

12 project but may be unaware of changes in circumstances or new information of

13 importance to the project. Nothing in CEQA or the Guidelines requires the agency to

14 conduct an investigation to ferret out changes in circumstances or new information. If

15 the agency becomes aware of such factors, however, it should then consider all the
16

17 relevant facts and explicitly decide whether conditions exist that necessitate further

18 environmental review. If a project opponent is aware of changed circumstances or new

19 information, bringing that material to the agency's attention might obligate the agency to

20 conduct an investigation to determine whether further environmental review is required."
21 & (Kostka & Zischke, Practice Under the California Environmental Quality Act (2d ed Cal
22

23 CEB) § 19.37.)

24 The District made an implied finding of no changes to the project that require

25 further environmental review under Public Resources Code section 21166. The

26 District's 2020 Alternatives Report states: "No legal challenges were filed under CEQA
27 against the Original Site or the Alternative Site where the Proposal would be located.
28

- 27-

1 Thus, the Final MND and Addendum are presumed valid under Public Resources Code

2 sections 21080.1 and 21167.2 and State CEQA Guidelines section 15231." (AR 4:29.)

3 "CEQA does not set forth any particular procedure to support an agency's
decision that a new EIR [or MND] is not required. CEQA does not require an initial
5

6 study or public hearing in these circumstances." (Committee for Re-Evaluation of T-

7 Line Loop V. San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th

8 1237, 1256.) As explained in Kostka & Zischke, Practice Under the California

9 Environmental Quality Act, supra, § 19.48: ""There is no specific requirement in CEQA
10

11 or the CEQA Guidelines that public notice and an opportunity to comment be provided

12 in connection with a determination of whether a subsequent or supplemental EIR is

13 required for a project." (Citing Pub. Resources Code, § 21166; Guidelines, § 15162; A

14 Local & Regional Monitor (ALARM) v. City of Los Angeles (1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1773,

15 1804 ["holding that CEQA does not require a public hearing or public comment before a
16

17 determination whether a subsequent or supplemental EIR is required"]; Concemed

18 Citizens of South Central L.A. v. Los Angeles Unified School Dist. (1994) 24

19 Cal.App.4th 826, 845.)

20 In Santa Teresa Citizen Action Group v. City of San Jose (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th
21 689, 701-702, the Court found the exhaustion requirement of Public Resources Code
22

23 section 21177 did not apply where "there was no clearly defined administrative

24 procedure for petitioners to resolve their concerns about the project as it was finally

25 configured." But in several other cases, the Court has a come to a contrary conclusion.

26 (ALARM, supra, 12 Cal.App.4th at p. 1804 ['"At no time during the administrative
27 process did anyone ... suggest that a separate public hearing was required."]; Mani
28
Brothers Real Estate Group v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 153 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1394-

- 28 -

1395 [finding the exhaustion requirement applied where regularly schedule meetings

2 open to the public were held, even if not "duly noticed public hearings under CEQA"].)14

3 In Bridges v. Mt. San Jacinto Community College District (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 104,
117, the Court followed Mani Brothers, concluding that the CEQA exhaustion
5

6 requirement was triggered even though there was not a public hearing held under

7 CEQA, where there was a regularly scheduled meeting that was open to the public.

8 There is no dispute that a public hearing on the District's consideration of the

9 qualified exemption was posted as required. While the City argues that the District
10 failed to provide adequate notice that an environmental decision would be made, a
11

12 public hearing is not required for an implied finding of no subsequent environmental

13 review. In addition, the City was able to comment and generally asserted that the

14 CEQA document failed to address feasibility alternatives. (AR 101:7707-7708.) The

15 City had an opportunity during the administrative proceeding to raise its CEQA objection
16 that significant new information existed but failed to do so. It has failed to show CEQA's
17

18 exhaustion exception applies. This issue is barred by the failure to exhaust
19 administrative remedies.

20 C. There is No Basis for Finding the Existence of Significant New Information.
21 In Bridges, even though the Court found the failure to exhaust, the Court went on
22

23 to evaluate the merits of the CEQA claim as if exhaustion did not apply. (Bridges,

24 supra, 14 Cal.App.5th at pp. 118-126.) Here, even if the exhaustion conclusion did not

25 preclude the City's claim, the CEQA argument lacks merit.

26

27
14 Public Resources Code section 21177, setting forth the exhaustion requirement, provides at subdivision (e):
28 *This section does not apply to any alleged grounds for noncompliance with this division for which there was no publio hearing or other opportunity for members of the public to raise those objections orally or in writing before the approvall of the project, or if the public agency failed to give the notice required by law."

- 29 -

First, there is no statutory basis for the City's request for judicial notice of the
November 2019 News Release, and the City does not explain why it failed to seek to

augment the administrative record prior to briefing on the merits.
But even if the court were to consider the News Release, it is insufficient to

trigger subsequent environmental analysis. "CEQA analysis is concerned with a

7 project's impact on the environment, rather than with the environment's impact on a
project and its users or residents." (California Building Industry Association v. Bay Area
Air Quality Management District (2015) 62 Cal.4th 369, 378.) CEQA does not require
10 analysis of the impact of existing environmental conditions on a project's future users or
11

12 residents. (ld. at p. 377.) Guidelines section 15126.2, subdivision (a), is consistent with

13 the ruling in Califomia Building Industry Association.

14 Given that an MND is at issue, the News Release's discussion of a new

15 assessed increased risk of flooding during an extreme flood event does not constitute
16

17 substantial evidence in favor of a fair argument that a new significant environmental

18 impact from the project may occur. (San Mateo Gardens, supra, 1 Cal.5th at p. 959.)

19 The increased flood assessment risk is not new information of substantial importance

20 because it does not constitute substantial evidence that the project may exacerbate the

21 existing flooding risk. Therefore, the City's CEQA argument is without merit.

Introduction

Petitioner City of Hesperia (the "City") seeks a writ of mandate to prevent
Respondent Lake Arrowhead Community Services District (the "District") 1 from building
5

6 a solar energy project on land the District owns in an area of the Citnown as
Hesperia Farms. The City contends the project violates the City's ger plan and

8 zoning ordinances. The District, however, contends it is statutorily exemp
9 compliance pursuant to Government Code section 530 subdivision (a), which

10 provides an exemption for projects related to th torage on ansmission" of electricity
11
when there is "no feasible alternative."
12

13 The project is intended to generate electricity pursuant to the Local Government

14 Renewable Energy Self-Genera Bill Credit Transfer program ("RES-BCT"),2 which

15 allows local governments, under sporified circumstances, to generate electricity on one
16

17 site, export it to the electrical grid, and apo the resulting energy credits against

18 electricity bills in arred op a different site. (Pub. Util. Code, § 2830.) To comply with

19 the requirel ent for, emption from the City's general plan and zoning ordinances, the

20 District determin that th is "no feasible alternative" to the Hesperia Farms site,

21 because other sites suld not be suitable for the District's intended purpose-
22

23 generating electricity under the RES-BCT program.

24 However, the District's premise underlying the selection of the site in Hesperia

25 Farms-that the site qualifies for the RES-BCT program-is mistaken. The site does not

26

qualify for the program because it is not located "within the geographical boundary" of

2 the District, as required by section 2830, subdivision (a)(4)(C). Although other sites

3 may be infeasible because they are unusable for the RES-BCT program, or for other

4 reasons, this site is also infeasible because it is not within the geographical boundary of

the District. Therefore, the statutory exemption from the City's general plan and zoning

7 ordinances does not apply. Accordingly, the City's petition for a wit of mandate is

8 granted.3

10 Background
11

12 A. The Former Version of the Project

13 In 2016, the City brought a similar writ petition chanonging an earlier decision by

14 the District to approve a similar project in the same general area. (City of
15

16 Hesperia v. Lake Arrowhead nity Services District et al., San Bernardino County

17 Superior Court Case No. CIVDS160201 As in this case, the City contended that the

18 project did not comply he City's general plan and zoning ordinances. Also as in

19 the case, the pistrict contended that the project was statutorily exempt from compliance.
20 The trial count ed with *he City and granted the petition. The Court of Appeal
21

22 affirmed the judgmo City of Hesperia V. Lake Arrowhead Community Services

23 District (2019) 37 Cal.App.5th 734, finding that the project was not exempt from the

24 City's general plan and zoning ordinances.

25 The Court of Appeal began its analysis with the observation that "the Legislature
26 has attempted to achieve a balance between the state's interest in allowing local

Other grounds for the petition are denied as addressed infra, in § IV.

- 2 -

agencies to produce, generate, store, and transmit water or electrical energy and the

2 cities' and counties' control over local building and zoning." (City of Hesperia, supra, at

p. 739.) The specific issue before the Court was whether the District's solar project

4 was "exempt from-or must comply with--the zoning ordinances" of the City. (lbid.)
The Court summarized the statutory scheme, which balances the competing interests:
6
Our analysis begins with the statutory requirement that, for purposes of a proposed solar energy project, a local agency, must comply with the zoning ordinances of the city nd county in which the project's facilities are to be cons ucted
9 or located. (Gov. Code, § 53091, subd. (a) Then,

10 potentially applicable here, section 53091, sur ivision (§ 53091(e)), and section 53096, subdivision (a)
11 (§ 53096(a)), each provides the age with an exempu
12 for the location and construction, rtain types of facilities. Section 53091(e) provtes ancabsolute
13 exemption for "the location or constructioe of facilities. for
the production or generation of electrical energy'unless
14 the facilities are "for the storage or transmission of electrical

15 energy," in which event the zoning ordinances apply. Section 53096(a) provides a qualified exemption for an agency's
16 proposed use upon, first, a showing that the development is
for facilities related to storage or transmission of water or
17 electrical enen and, second, a resolution by four-fifths of

18 the agency's me bers that there is no feasible alternative to [the ag 1 nrop cal."
19
(City of Hesperia, supra, Cal.App.5th at pp. 739-740, italics in original.)
20

21 hough the parties agreed that the project qualified as a solar farm under

22 Municipal Code ("HMC") section 16.16.063, which addresses "alternative

23 energy techn logy standards," the zoning of the property presented an obstruction.

24 HMC section 16.16.063.B, provides:
25

26 Solar farms shall only be allowed on nonresidential and
nonagricultural designated properties with approval of a
27 conditional use permit by the planning commission. Solar farms shall not be permitted within six hundred sixty (660)
28 a feet of a railway, spur, any interstate, highway, or major

- 3 -

arterial, arterial, or secondary arterial roadway; or any agricultural or residentially designated property.

(Italics added; AR 76:6892.)

The property where the District intended to build the project was zoned "Rural

5 Residential," and the solar project was to be located within 660 feet of property to the

6 south, zoned for agricultural use. (City of Hesperia, supra, at pp. 741-7 Therefore,

the project was prohibited under HMC section 16.16.063.B, unless exen tion

9 applied-either the absolute exemption under Government Code section 53091

10 subdivision (e), or the qualified exemption under Government Code section 50096,

11 subdivision (a).

12 Attempting to address this problem, the District adopted Resolution determining
13 that the project met the criteria for both absolute exemption and the qualified
14

15 exemption. First, the District found that the abs xemption applied because the

16 District was a generator of electricity. Secon the District found that the qualified
17 exemption applied because bere was no feasible alternative" to the location of the

18 project. (City of Hes upra, 97 Cal.App.5th at pp. 743-744.)
19
The City sued and trial court found that the proposed project did not fall within
20

21 the abs *te exemption, because the project included the transmission of electrical

22 er hich is excluded from the exemption provided by section 53091, subdivision

23 (e), for gene  tion or production of electrical energy. The trial court also found that the

24 qualified exemption based on infeasibility was not supported by substantial evidence.
25

26 Therefore, the trial court found that the project was not exempt from the City's general

27 plan and zoning ordinances.

28 The District appealed.

- 4 -

In 2017, the parties agreed to stay the appeal while the District applied for

2 General Plan Amendment to change the land use designation of Hesperia Farms to
Public (i.e., not Rural Residential) and for approval of a Conditional Use Permit ("CUP")
to construct a solar farm on the property. (AR 4:20-21; AR 36:2568-2569; AR 44:3121-

3123.) The project was the same as the original version except for nng it 660 feet to
6

7 the north to comply with HMC section 16.16.063.B (prohibiting solan oje within 660

feet of property zoned for agricultural use). If the City granted the Districh aprcation,

9 the issues on appeal would be moot and the project d go forward

10 On January 16, 2018, however, the City denied the trict's applications and on
11

12 March 20, 2018, adopted Resolution No. 2018-09, denying the General Plan
13 Amendment, and adopted Resolution 8-10. denying the CUP. (AR 51:4160; AR

14 61:4292-4296; AR 62:4297-4300.)

15 The District did not challenge the City's denials. Instead, the appeal proceeded,
16 resulting in the City of Hespete decision in favor of the City, filed July 19, 2019.4

21 also affirmed the tria urt's conclusion that the proposed project did not fall within the
22

23 qualified exemption, because substantial evidence did not support the District's

24 conclusion that there was "no feasible alternative" to the location chosen for the project.

25 (City of Hesperia, supra, at pp. 740, 760-766.) In determining feasibility, the Court

26 found guidance in the application of feasible alternatives and feasible mitigation

2 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"). (City of Hesperia, supra, at pp. 762-764, 767.)

3 B. The Current Version of the Project

4

5 Shortly after the appellate court issued its ruling, the District arranged for
6 consultants to prepare two technical reports, which had not been prepared for the

7 original project. The first was entitled RES-BCT Project Review (the "Sage Report").

8 The second was entitled Technical Memorandum for Feasibility aluation of Potential

9
Photovoltaic System Sites (the "Tidewater Memorandum Based these studies, the
10

11 District's staff prepared a report entitled "Alternatiy to Proposed Photovoltaic

12 System on Hesperia Farms Property (the "Alt âuces Report").

13 On June 23, 2020, the District held a public heam on the solar project as it was
14 described in the earlier General Plan and CUP applications, which the City had denied.
15

16 The District then adopted Res 2020-04, finding that there is no feasible

17 alternative to the proposed project, pur uant to the qualified exemption of Government

18 Code section 53096. (AR 3:11-14.) The Resolution stated:

19 District's determination is based on [the] Alternatives
20 Report including but not limited to the Tidewater Memrandum and the Sage Report, and the remaining
21 mnistratiy record for such determination, the District's

22 app val Original Site, and the District's approval of
the Alt ative Site (the Proposal).
23
(Id. at p. 12.) The Resolution found that the District's determination rendered the City's
24

25 general plan and zoning ordinances inapplicable based on the newly supported

26 qualified exemption. (lbid.)

27 The City, however, contends that the District's determination that it is statutorily

28 exempt from compliance with the City's general plan and zoning ordinances is still

- 6-

invalid because the site does not qualify for the RES-BCT program and because the

District's determination is unsupported by substantial evidence in other respects as well.

III

4 The District's Reliance on the RES-BCT Program is Misplaced.
A. Whether the Project Qualifies for the RES-BCT Program is a Question of
Statutory Interpretation, Subject to De Novo Review.

8 The City's first cause of action seeks a writ of mandate undl Code of Civil
9 Procedure section 1085 (a "traditional" writ) directing the Disthec proceed with the
10

11 project on the ground that the project site fails eet the requirements for the RES-

12 BCT program under Public Jtilities Code section 283 (Petition, 1I 46-49; Prayer for

13 Relief, T1.)

14 The City's third cause of dion seeks a writ of mandate under Code of Civil
15

16 Procedure section 1094.5 (an "admgistrative writ") and under section 1085, also

17 directing the District not to proceed with project without complying with the City's
18 general plan andzoning ordinances. (Petition 11 58-63; Prayer for Relief, 1 3.) The

19 third cause action Aleges that the District's determination that there was "no feasible

20
alternative" to site is unpupported by substantial evidence. (Petition T 61.) The City |
21

22 argues that because project site fails to meet the requirements of the RES-BCT

23 program, the site is not a "feasible" site for the project.5

24 Usually, the standard of review for a traditional writ is whether the agency's

25 action was "arbitrary, capricious, entirely lacking in evidentiary support, or failed to
26
follow the procedure required by law." (Martis Camp Community Assn. V. County of 27

28

5 Other grounds for the City's contention that the District's determination of "no feasible alternative" is unsupported are discussed infra, at § IV.

- 7 -

1 Placer (2020) 53 Cal.App.5th 569, 594.) For an administrative writ, the standard of

2 review usually is whether the agency's decision is supported by substantial evidence.

3 (City of Hesperia, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at pp. 747-748, 761-762.) But the question

4 program is proper involves a question of whether the City's reliance on the RES-BCT
5
statutory interpretation. Whether an agency's decision is reviewed under traditional or
6

7 administrative mandamus, the interpretation and application of a statute to undisputed

8 facts involves a question of law. In such circumstance, the coun exercises independent

9 judgment and reviews the issue de novo, relying on settled rules 0l tatutory

10 construction. (Department of Health Care Services Tice onn dmitestrative
11

12 6 Hearings (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th 120, 139-141.)

13 As explained below, under the de novo standard of review (or, for that matter,

14 under the "arbitrary and capricious" or "sbstal evidence" standards), the District's

15 selection of the project site for the RES-BC ogram is improper.
16 B. The Project Does Not Qualify for the DES-BCT Program Because it is Not
17

18 Located Within the 6C ographical Boundary" of the District, as Required

19 by Publie Utilit Coae jon 2830.

20 Under specified circumatances, Public Utilities Code section 2830 allows a "local
21

22 goy ent" to generate electricity on one site it owns, export it to the it electrical grid,

23 and apply ulting energy credits against bills for electricity used by the local

24 government on another site it owns. There is no dispute that the District qualifies as a

25 "local government" pursuant to section 2830, subdivision (a)(6), defining a "local
26
government" to include a "special district." There is also no dispute that the District 27

28 owns the project site and owns other property to which credits could be applied.

- 8 -

1 On August 27, 2015, the District entered into a Generator Interconnection

2 Agreement for the project with Southern California Edison Company (SCE) pursuant to

3 section 2830. (AR 26:1777-1838.)

4 To be eligible for the program, however, a "generation facility," such as the one
5
contemplated for this project, is subject to other requirements as We Section 2830,
6

7 subdivision (a)(4), provides in relevant part:

8 "Eligible renewable generating facility" means a generation facility that meets all of the following requirements:
9

10 (C) Is located within the geographical bounduty of the local
government .
11

12 (Italics added.)

13 The geographical boundary of the Disu shown on a map set forth in a report

14 by the Local Agency Formation Commissiol the County of San Bernardino

15 (LAFCO). (2016 AR 77:2716.)6 The geograph cal boundary encloses the area depicted
16 in yellow on the man The proct site is not located within this boundary, but is some 17

18 eight miles north of Lan Arrowne (AR 4:49.) The project site, geographically, is

19 within the boundary of the not within the boundary of the District.

20 he District, however, contends that the project site satisfies the requirement that

21 the projec located within the geographical boundary of the District, because LAFCO
22

23 has determined hat the site is within the District's "sphere of influence."7 But a "sphere

24 of influence" is a separate concept from a "geographical boundary."

25

26

27
Citation to "2016 AR" refers to the administrative record from the 2016 litigation that was made part of the
28 certified administrative record.

Presumably, SCE took the same view or it would not have entered into a contract for the RES-BCT program with the District.

- 9-

1 A special district "is an entity of limited powers, and it has specifically

2 circumscribed geographic and 'sphere of influence' boundaries." (Modesto Irrigation

3 Dist. v. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (N.D. Cal. 2004) 309 F.Supp.2d 1156 1159, fn.

4 omitted.)8
5
Government Code section 56076 defines "sphere of influence" "plan fo the
6

7 probable physical boundaries and service area of a local agency, as determ by the

8 commission [LAFCO]." (Italics added.) "In this sense, phere of influence' is a

9 prospective measure, charting what a ... district's boundaries aight be at some future
10 point. A district's 'sphere of influence' is not necessarily coextensive with its existing
11

12 service area." (Modesto Irrigation, supra, at p. 1159, fn. 4, citations omitted.)

13 LAFCO specifically note be distinction: "Any sphere modifications would not

14 affect any agency's current boundary (2016 AR 77:2316; see also 2016 AR

15 77:2317-2318, 2344-2345 [discussing tha since 1983, the District's boundary and
16 sphere of influesce had been coterminous and including map showing that the Hesperia
17

18 Farms prop iS coterminous with the District's boundary].)

19 lthough verns Code section 56076 uses the term "physical boundaries,"

20 rather than the term geographical boundary," the District's "sphere of influence" is

21 distinct from its "geographical boundary." LAFCO's determination that the project site is
22
a "plan for the probable physical boundary" indicates that another step is required 23

24

25 Government Code section 56036 defines "district" and "special district" as synonymous and as "an agency of the state, formed pursuant to general law or special act, for the local performance of governmental or proprietary functions within limited boundaries and in areas outside district boundaries when authorized by the commission 26 pursuant to Section 56133." Section 56133 allows a district to provide new or extended services outside its
Il jurisdictional boundary and within its sphere of influence with LAFCO's authorization. Jurisdictional boundaries are
27 de facto less expansive than 'spheres of influence." (Modesto Irrigation, supra, 309 F.Supp.2d at p. 1167 fn. 21; see
also Community Water Coalition v. Santa Cruz County Local Agency Formation Com. (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 1317.
28 1325, fn. 3.) Section 56133's use of the term "jurisdictional boundary" is not demonstrated to be relevant to the issue whether a "sphere of influence" is within the District's "geographical boundary."

- 10 -

1 before the site is within the geographical boundary, namely annexation. (See 2016 AR

2 77:2317, 2344 [discussing that annexation would avoid property tax].) Annexation is

3 "the inclusion, attachment, or addition of territory to a city or district." (Gov. Code, §

4 56017.)9 That has not occurred.
5

6 Therefore applying the de novo standard of review, the Distect's selection of the

7 project site for use under the RES-BCT program was impropen

8 As a result, the District's reliance on the S-BCT program is impermissible

9 because the project site is not located within the Distit's geographical boundary, as

10 required by Public Resources Code section 2830, subdivis on (a)(4)(C). The District's
11

12 finding that there are no feasible nternative sites is based in large part on the operation

13 of an economically viable RES- vstem to generate bill credits. (AR 4:22-23, 42-

14 43.) But the District cannot rely on the qL lified exemption from the City's general plan

15 and zoning ordinances under Government Code section 53096, subdivision (a), if the
16
RES-BCT •gram not viable on the site.11 The District must first comply with the
17

18 City's general and zof ng ordinances.

19

20

21

22

23 9 Bringing property within a sphere of influence facilitates annexation. (City of Agoura V. Hills v. Local Agency Formation Com. (1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 480, 491.)
24
10 In the prior litigation, the trial court discussed the RES-BCT program and the Agreement entered into on
25 August 27, 2015, rejecting the City's argument that the District had no authority to enter into the Agreement under Government Code sections 61000, et seq. (City's Request for Judicial Notice, Exh. B, Ruling at p. 4:12-6:3.) The
26 appellate court noted this finding, stating: "Deciding that the District has authority under the RES-BCT Program (Pub. Util. Code, § 2830) to produce electricity for Edison, the trial court denied the writ of mandate under the first cause of
27 action. (City of Hesperia, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at p. 745.) The District here does not argue that principles of res judicata or collateral estoppel preclude the City's new attack on the District's qualification for the RES-BCT program.

28 Therefore, these principles are not considered.

11 The absolute exemption, at issue in at the prior litigation, is not at issue here.

- 11 -

1 C. The City Has Standing to Challenge the District's Reliance on the RES-BCT

2 Program.

3 The District argues, however, that the City lacks standing to challenge the
4

5 District's agreement with SCE for the RES-BCT program. First and foremost, the City's

6 argument is not an attack on the agreement per se; it is an attack on the District's use of

7 the agreement to establish that the Hesperia Farms site is the only "feasible" location for

8 the project.
9
Furthermore, Code of Civil Procedure section 108 rovides. 'The writ must be
10

11 issued in all cases where there is not a plain, spee and adequat nedy, in the

12 ordinary course of law. It must be issued upo erified petition of the party

13 beneficially interested." (Italics added.) "The term "ben ticially interested' generally

14 means that the person "has some special interest to be served or some particular right
15
and above the interest held in common with the public 16 to be preserved or protected,

17 at large. [Citations.]" (Sál the Plas Bag [Coalition V. City of Manhattan Beach

18 (2011)l 52 Cal.4th 166.) addition, the beneficial interest must be substantial

19 and direct. (lbid.) If the rit sought would enforce only a technical, abstract or moot
20 right, the interest is not substaetial for purposes of the beneficial interest requirement.
21

22 (Brj City of Los Angeles (1990) 226 Cal.App.3d 83, 87 [276 Cal. Rptr. 256].)"

23 (Consolidâu Irrigation Dist. v. City of Selma (2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 187, 205.)

24 In Consordated Irrigation District, the Court discussed that a public agency may

25 be beneficially interested if its "resources or programs administered ... may be affected
26
by the project. [Citations.J' [Citations.]" (lbid.) The Court found that the special
27

28 district's operation of a groundwater recharge program gave it a beneficial interest to

• 12 -

challenge an environmental impact report because the project could affect the district's

2 efforts to add to local groundwater. (ld. at p. 206.)

3 The City demonstrates it has a special interest in the enforcement of its zoning

4 ordinances. The use of Hesperia Farms as a solar farm project under the RES-BCT
5

6 program implicates the City's ability to enforce its zoning ordinances as a result of

7 Government Code section 53096, subdivision (a). Therefore, the mhas a special

8 interest in the operation of the project under the RES-BCT program City's

9 limits. The District's qualification for the program is tied to the feasibility ar
10 Therefore, the City has standing to challenge the Distria finding that the project site is
11

12 the only feasible alternative because the District's intended of the site is not allowed

13 when the site has not been annexed within the District's "geographical boundary."

14 D. The District Has Not Demonstra Statute of Limitations Bar to the City's

15 Challenge.
16

17 The District argues at the City's challenge to the District's use of the RES-BCT

18 program is barred statuton limitations, whether the thirty-day limitations period

19 of Government Code sèl 1152s, applicable to challenges to agencies subject to the
20 Administrative Procedure Acior the four-year "catch-all" limitations period of Code of
21

22 Civi cedure section 343.

23 The urt cannot consider the District's argument under these statutes, because

24 the District's Answer did not place these limitations periods in issue. The District's

25 Eleventh Affirmative Defense asserted that the Petition is barred by the applicable
26

27 statute of limitations "including but not limited to California Public Resources Code

28 section 21167 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.6." Public Resources Code

section 21167 applies to CEQA and is not applicable to whether the District is eligible

- 13 -

1 for the RES-BCT program. As for Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.6, the District

2 does not argue it applies. Because the District's Answer failed to plead the specific

3 statutes of limitation argued in the District's opposition, they cannot be considered.

7 The City's Other Grounds for Challenging*

8 the Feasibility Finding are Unsupported.

9 A. City of Hesperia Requires a Consideration of Alternative Locations.

10
As discussed above, Government Code section 530% subdivision (a), provides:
11

12 "Each local agency shall comply with all applicable building ordinances and zoning

13 ordinances of the county or city in which ritory of the local agency is situated."

14 Also discussed above, Government Code 53036, subdivision (a), provides a

15 qualified exemption for a local agency's use o property for facilities "related to storage
16
or transmission of
17 electricacenergy" when there is no "feasible alternative."

18 City of Hesperta consiu EQA as "guidance" for analyzing the definition of
19 "feasible" in section 53096, bdivision (c), given the lack of other authority.12 (City of
20 Hesperia, supra 37 Cal.App.5th at p. 762.) Under CEQA, "[t]he range of alternatives is
21 I governed by the "rule of reason," which requires an analysis of the alternatives
22

23 necessary to permit a reasoned choice. An [environmental impact report] need not

24 consider an alternative, the effect of which cannot be reasonably ascertained and the

25 implementation of which is remote and speculative." (ld. at p. 763, quoting Citizens of

26

27

28 12 'Feasible" means "capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time, taking into account economic, environmental, social, and technological factors." (Gov. Code, § 53096, subd. (c).)

- 14 -

Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 1167, 1177-1178, fn.

2 omitted in original.)

3 As under CEQA, for purposes of section 53096, the "rule of reason' requires

4 I consideration of alternatives." (Ibid.) City of Hesperia found:
5
For section 53096(a)'s qualified exemption to apply,
6 53096, subdivision (c)'s definition of 'feasible' require  "he
necessary finding to be there is no alternative to th agency's proposal that is 'capable of being accomphched
8 a successful manner within a reasonable poriod of tin and

9 that necessary finding must be supported by suestantis evidence of the 'economic, environmental, social,

10 technological factors.'

11 (City of Hesperia, supra, at p. 764.) The coutstate

12 [U]n order for the District to have properly de rmined that
13 "there is no feasible alternative" to the proposed location of
the Solar Project for curposes of section 53096(a), the
14 District was requi to have: (1) considered alternative

15 locations; (2) o account economic, environmental,
social, and technologicn" factors associated with both the
16 Project Site and the altern tive locations; and (3) determined-i.e., exercised viscretion based on substantial
17 evidence in the administrative record-that, at the alternative

18 ntions, the proposal was not capable of being
ccomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable
19 period /time.

20 (ld. at p. 767.) erefore nder City of Hesperia, this is the standard to apply when

21 determining whether ubstantial evidence supports the District's feasibility finding.13
22 B. The District's Purpose in Choosing the Project Site is Irrelevant.
23

24 In City of Lafayette V. East Bay Municipal District (1993) 16 Cal.App.4th 1005,

25 1017, the Court wrote:
26

27
13 The District's argument that "even under CEQA an agency is not required to provide the public with an
28 opportunity to review and comment or debate an agency's economic feasibility analysis" (Opp. Br. p. 21:7-9, citing Sierra Club v. County of Napa (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 1490, 1505-1506), is irrelevant. Government Code section 53096, subdivision (a) requires a public hearing with at least ten days' notice.

1 The primary objective of the statutory scheme is to maintain local control of land use decisions (§ 53091), with carefully

countervailing interests.

5 Relying on Lafayette, the City argues that the project does not "further
6 countervailing interests" such as placing water or electricity facilities that are necessary

7 and indispensable to the agency's authorized functions, becausel ne District's purpöse
8
sts.
9 in building the project is merely to reduce its own electricity

10 This argument directed to the agency's pur se was previousn ejected in City o1

11 Hesperia in connection with the Court's discul sion the absolute exemption. The

12 Court found, contrary to the City's argument, that the exo option is based "on the
13 purpose of the proposed facilities, on the purpose of the agency developing the
14

15 proposed facilities." (City of ria, supra, at p. 755, italics in original; footnote

16 omitted.) The City argued that the exe ption should not apply because the project was

17 not "integral" or "directly related" to the District's authorized function to provide water

18 and wastewatn treatment. The Court found this to be irrelevant to the application of the
19
absolutefexerenti
20

21 The City fan to  ovide any different analysis for the qualified exemption that

22 would distinguish it from the argument already rejected by the Court of Appeal in
23 connection with the absolute exemption. The project is related to the transmission of is

24 electrical energy project to which section 53096 applies. The District's purpose for the
25

26 project is irrelevant. This ground for a writ is denied.

27

14
28 Lafayette addressed the legislative intent of the statutory scheme with respect to water. City of Hesperia found the same legislative intent when "proposed facilities are for the production or generation of electrical energy." (City of Hesperia, supra, at p. 752, italics in original.)

C. Procedures Under CEQA are Irrelevant to the Alternatives Analysis.

5 The City argues that the alternatives standards under CEQA, including the time

6

7 given to review and comment on a draft Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"), should

8 apply to the alternatives analysis under Government Code section 53096. This

9 argument apparently relates to a claimed procedural defect in the District's

10 I proceedings-that it did not proceed as it would proceed der CE "Where the

11 alleged defect is that the agency has failed to proceed in the manno guired by law,

12

13 the court determines de novo whether the agency has employed the correct

14 procedures, scrupulously enforcing all lecislatively mandated requirements." (Chico

15 Advocates for a Responsible Economy hico (2019) 40 Cal.App.5th 839, 845,

16 citation omitted.) Therefore, this court consvers the argument de novo.

17 The City has failed  demonstrate that the CEQA requirements applicable to

18 public notice and th

19 tice pened for review of an EIR are relevant to the notice period

20 required for a hearing onche qualmled exemption under section 53096. Section 53096,

21 subdivision (a), sets forth the inimum public notice period of at least ten days. The

22 Dist complied with the notice requirement. This ground for a writ is denied.

23

24 D. If the Project Site Were Qualified for the RES-BCT Program, the

25 • Methodology Employed for the Analysis of Alternatives is Not Shown to be

26 Otherwise Inadequate.

27 Because the project does not qualify for the RES-BCT program, the analysis of
28 alternatives is fundamentally flawed, and the selection of the project site in Hesperia

- 17 -

1 Farms is unsupported by substantial evidence. The discussion below assumes

2 arguendo that the project qualifies for the RES-BCT program.

3 Much of the City's argument about the District's feasibility determination amounts

4 to a criticism of the parameters used in the Tidewater Memorandum, the District's

5
| Alternatives Report relies on. The City complains that there is no e denc the
6

7 "analytic route the administrative agency traveled from evidence to action

8 determining why the particular sites received the partioular scores they received. The

9 City complains about the twenty parameters used, assertine that they are different from

10 those used in studies of different solar projects that the Tidewat Memorandum
11

12 referenced as a basis for the parameten argues that the large number of parameters

13 used by Tidewater invites and facilitates r

14 The City's argument is insufficient to monstrate that substantial evidence does

15 not support the feasibility fin ings in light of the whole record. The City's burden is
16
discuss all relevant issue of the feasibility findings and to demonstrate
17

18 that substantial evidence es not support the District's findings in light of the whole

19 record, Latinos Unidos de Napa v. City of Napa (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 192, 206.)15

20 ncerning judicial review of administrative findings on feasible alternatives, the

21 Court in City Hesperia wrote:
22
"The reviewing court, like the trial court, may not reweigh the
23 evidence, and is "bound to consider the facts in the light

24 most favorable to the Board, giving it every reasonable inference and resolving all conflicts in its favor." [Citations
25 omitted.] There is a presumption that the agency's findings

26 15 '[S]ubstantial evidence' has been defined in two ways: first, as evidence of "ponderable legal significance

27 reasonable in nature, credible, and of solid value' [citation]; and second, as "relevant evidence that a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion™ [citation]." (County of San Diego v. Assessment Appeals Bd. No. 2 (1983) 148 Cal.App.3d 548, 555.) "[W]hen applying the substantial evidence test, 'Courts may reverse an
28 agency's decision only if, based on the evidence before the agency, a reasonable person could not reach the conclusion reached by the agency.' [Citation.] (Italics in original.)" (Greenebaum v. City of L.A. (1984) 153 Cal.App.3d 391, 401-402.)

- 18 -

1 are supported by substantial evidence; and since the party challenging those findings has the burden of demonstrating
2 otherwise, here the City must establish that the
administrative record does not contain substantial evider
3 to support the Board's finding that there is no feasible

4 alternative to the Project Site.

5 (City of Hesperia, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at p. 761.) This standard apphr with

6 force to this case.

7 While the City complains about the Tidewater paranaters used for environmental
8
and technical criteria and the scoring, it does not provide any rel son for the court to
9

10 conclude that deviation from other studi methodologies was without any foundation,

11 not credible, or unreasonable. City idewater did not provide any

12 support for its scoring and ethodolo! but the City fails to discuss the
13 analytical route taken by Tidewater in posing the parameters that were evaluated and
14

15 the basis for assigning the scoring ranges for particular parameters, and weighing

16 factors as it (AR 4:54-59.)16

17 fails to address the Tidewater discussion that subjective weighting

18 factors were deten according to relative importance for a successful system
19
location. The Tidewater Memorandum explained that the reason "technical parameters"
20

21

22

16
23 The Tidewater Memorandum evaluated the following criteria for solar system producing similar quantities of electricity as the previously approved system: economic, environmental, social, and technical. Within each criteria, specific parameters were established. (AR 4:54-59.) For example, "technical" included parameters such as shading, 24 elevation, and average annual cloudy days. (AR 4:54.) With respect to elevation the Tidewater Memorandum
provided the following discussion:
25 Atmosphere thickness and composition influence the availability of both short

26 and longwave energy of the sun and earth, respectively. The lower the
evaluation of a region from sea level, the greater the atmosphere thickness;

27 therefore, a PV system's site location with respect to evaluation influence the system efficiency (Noorollahi et al., 2016). Those site locations located at less
than 2,500 feet amsl were assigned a value of 0. Those site locations ranging
28 from 2,500 to 5,000 feet amsl were assigned a value of 5, and those site
(AR 4:58.) locations greater than 5,000 amsl were assigned a value of 10. a

- 19 -

1 were given the largest weighted factor was the ability to produce the requisite, annual

2 electrical output needed for a viable system. a (AR 4:42, 61.)

3 In making its arguments, the City also fails to discuss all the relevant evidence on|

4 which the District's findings rely, including the RES-BCT Project Review prepared by
5

6 Sage Energy Consulting, Inc. (AR 4:634-635. 637.)17

7 The District's report provided a detailed discussion on inves igation of

8 renewable energy options "to offset costs and ensy requirements as ociated with

9 current and projected water and wastewater deman (AR 4:17-22.) Evaluation was
10 based on project objectives related to substantially offset existing and future
11
electricity costs. (AR 4:16, 22-2 The District considered other alternative forms of
12

13 renewable energy, including ermal, hydroelectric energy, wind, geothermal, and

14 digester gas, and provided reasons for blecting solar technology and rejecting other

15 alternatives based on the project objective to substantially offset existing and future
16
electricity CO (AR 4:29-32.)18
17

18 DN considered the following alternatives: no project, reapplying to the

19 City for approval ON oject, and alternative locations. (AR 4:32-42.) The District

20 provided a reasoned discussion and analysis why the "no project" and "re-apply"

21 proposals were determined infeasible in terms of the project objectives. (AR 4:32-34.)
22

23

17
24 Sage evaluated six possible sites for location of solar systems consistent with the District's goal to offset electrical costs. It also reviewed the project proposal at Hesperia Farms, "including the impact of changes in the RES-BCT tariff on the projected savings in electrical costs over the life of the Project." (AR 4:634.) In doing so, it 25 "evaluated the amount of RES-BCT bill credits generated and associated Benefiting Account credit capacity." (Ibid.)

26 Sage also considered different systems, including "wind speed data for potential wind energy systems in the area of [the District's] potential project sites.' (lbid.) It did so in relation to the District's intent to proceed with a project to 'offset the electrical energy cost of the operation of their water treatment, pumping, and management facilities."
27 (Ibid.) Sage discussed the reasons that other systems, such as a wind energy, were not feasible. (AR 4:634-635.) Sage also reviewed the Tidewater Memorandum and found that it adequately identified potential RES-BCT project
28 sites. (AR 4:637.)
18 Insofar as the RES-BCT is not available for the Hesperia Farms site, the analysis of these alternative forms of renewable energy may well be different.

- 20 -

1 For example, with the re-apply option, the District discussed that an alternative must be

2 "capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of
3  time™ and, given the history of the project, every indication was that a new application to

4 the City would be denied and a waste of further time and resources. (AR 4:34, quoting
5
Gov. Code § 53096, subd. (c).) Substantial evidence supports the District's conclusion.
6

7 In considering alternative sites, the District discussed the feasibility of acquiring

8 new sites and evaluated the use of other existing sites. (AR 4:3 42.) Its analysis

9 including a discussion of the findings in the Tidewater Memorandur and Sage Report,

10 concluded that there was no feasible alternative that met the prop jective to
11

12 substantially reduce the District's existing and energy costs within a reasonable

13 period. (AR 4:35-42.) The analytical route for the contusion was provided. The City's

14 attacks on the Tidewater parameters are insufficient to demonstrate that substantial

15 evidence does not support the trict's feasibility finding, assuming that the project
16 qualifies for the RES-BCT program.
17

18 The City also argues that the Tiden ater analysis did not take into account the

19 new analysis of the Mojave River Dam by the Army Corps. of Engineers. But the City

20 failed to present this evidence at the public hearing. There is no basis to take judicial

21 notic this document, and the City did not move to augment the administrative record
22
to Include Therefore, the City's argument on this issue is disregarded.
23

24 The City sserts that the Sage report's economic analysis of the different sites

25 fails to show how the comparison numbers were set and why size limitations were

26 placed on alternatives. The City takes issue that the alternative at "the Flats" site is
27 sized smaller at roughly one third the size of the proposed project even though the Flats
28
is a 4.45-acre site. (Reply, pp. 5:16-6:7.)

- 21 -

1 The District has not had an opportunity to respond, because the City first raised

2 the argument in its Reply brief. Nevertheless, the argument does not demonstrate that

3 substantial evidence fails to support the District's findings. Five acres is minimum

4 acreage for the proposed project. (AR 4:37, 47.) The Flats site is 4.5 acres. (AR 4:51.)
5
The Sage Report discussed that to be economically viable, an RES-BCT system needs
6

7 to be at least 350 kW DC and requires 3.0 acres. (AR 4:636.) RelaM the Flats, the

8 Sage Report states:

9 Although the Flats site is currently intended for use in the
10 construction of a new operations building and yard, we
evaluated it in its current condition as raw  and. The Flats
11 site is not large enough to accommodate a system large

12 enough to generate significant electricity cost ! ings. Sage
found that a 365 kW-DC single-axis tracking PV Sotem at
13 the site would provide less than $37,000 of annual savings,
6.5% of LACSD annual costs. In addition, the Flats
14 site has potential issues wr and interconnection that

15 could jeopardize the viability host solar. An
annotated SCE DRPEP map nown in Figure 1 below with
16 nearest access to distribution : proximately 1/3 of a mile
which would add ~$250,000 to erconnection costs, which
17 would render project financially unviable. Photographic

18 evidence shows potential 12kV spur along Hospital Road
to the f Ro Ranch Road that is not indicated on
19 the DRPL? map. :638.)

20 The Tidewater Memo ndum discussed that the Flats site has been committed to

21 the •Field Operations Department building and corporate yard. The Flats was
22
included its current condition as existing vacant land; however, once construction
23

24 begins, the site yould only be appropriate for potential rooftop and partial use." (AR

25 4:51.) In rejecting the Flats site as a viable alternative, the District noted that it has

26 committed the site "to its Field Operations Department building and corporate yard and

27 has already incurred costs in pursuit of that use." (AR 4:39.) When taken as a whole,
28

- 22 -

1 substantial evidence supports rejection of the Flats site as a feasible alternative in light

2 of the project objective.

3 Finally, the City asserts that the studies lack credibility because there was not an

4 adequate process to give the public time to review the studies and hire their own
5
consultants. But the District followed the public notice hearing requirements of
6

7 Government Code section 53096, subdivision (a), which provides foat least ten days

8 prior notice. The City's argument about the notice period and proced needs to be

9 addressed with the Legislature, not the court. (Estate of Horman (1971) 62,

10 77.)
11

12 E. Institutional Bias as an Improper Influence is Not own by the Record.

13 The City contends that "institutiopol bias" influenced the feasibility finding,

14 because the District had an ongoing relat nshi- th the consultant it hired to conduct
15

16 the analysis. But there is no basis to take jurcial notice of the contracts the City relies

17 on to support this argumen The court's inquiry under section 1094.5 is limited to the

18 administrative recoi City of speria, supra, 37 Cal.App.5th at p. 766.)

19 The City also arg that the Oistrict's decision is particularly vulnerable to
20 charges of "institutional bias" vecause its decision is to proceed with essentially the
21

22 sar oject that was previously struck down. Citing Residents Ad Hoc Stadium
23 Committee Board of Trustees of the California State University and Colleges (1979)

24 89 Cal.App.3d 274, 284, the City argues that there is a post hoc rationalization, given

25 that the District had spent $800,000 on the project by March 2018. (AR 63:4319.) The
26
City's argument is speculative, not based on evidence.
27

28 In Residents Ad Hoc Stadium Committee, the court discussed that CEQA

assumes as inevitable an institutional bias within an agency proposing a project, and

- 23 -

1 that Public Resources Code sections 21000 and 21100 impose procedural

2 I requirements to insure that the decision maker does not fail to note the facts and

3 understand arguments advanced by opponents. The City's argument that the precise

4 process detailed in CEQA must be followed to avoid an "institutional bias" claim is
5

6 without legal support. As previously explained, the requirements for the District's

7 feasibility consideration are set forth in City of Hesperia. The City s not provide any

8 legal analysis why the public hearing requirements of Government Co ection 52096,

9 subdivision (a), and the procedures set forth in City of Hesperia are insuffla

10 address "institutional bias" claims and to avoid post hoc rationalization
11

12 Nothing in Government Code section 531 subdivision (a), precludes using a

13 paid consultant to prepare the feasibility analysis. The dministrative record

14 demonstrates that the District performed an independent review of the consultants'

15 reports in drafting its Alternativa Report. (AR 4:15-43.)
16 Finally, the City asserts that self-serving nature of the studies relied on by the
17

18 District is demonstrated by Tidewater's invoduction and background sections that

19 advocate for the ite chosen in-2014. The City argues, "There is no questioning of the

20 analytical os in th acts, criteria used for comparison, and the ultimate conclusions."

21 (Opening Br. p. :9-10.) ut the City does not provide any analysis of what statements
22

23 were made in the inth duction and background that demonstrate "institutional bias." Its

24 conclusory argument is without support. (Citizens for Responsible Equitable

25 Environmental Development v. City of San Diego (2011) 196 Cal.App.4th 515, 529

26 ["[A]n attack on the evidence without a fair statement of the evidence is entitled to no

27 consideration when it is apparent that a substantial amount of evidence was received on

behalf of the respondent.' [Citation.J"].)

2 The City's CEQA Challenge is Unsupported.
A. Further Environmental Review is Not Required Due to Significant New

4 Information.

5

6 The City asserts that new information requires supplemental environmental

7 review under Public Resources Code section 21166 and Guidelines section 15162.

8
In general, once an EIR or negative declaration has been lopted for a project,
9

10 the lead agency is not required to prepare a subsequent of pplem ntal EIR unless

11 one of the following exists:

12 (a) Substantial changes are prososea the project which

13 will require major revisions of the environental impact
report.
14 (b) Substantial changes occur with respect to the
15 circumstances under Which the project is being undertaken
which will require ajor revisions in the environmental
16 impact report.

17 (c) New information, whh was not known and could not
have been known at the tin the environmental impact 18 report was certified as complete, becomes available.

19 (Pub. Resoura Code, § 21166; see also Guidelines, § 15162, subds. (a) and (b).)
20 Guidu es ction 15162, subdivision (c) provides: "Once a project has been
21

22 approved, the lea role in project approval is completed, unless further

23 discretionary approval on that project is required." (Guidelines, § 15162, subdivision

24 (c).) The CEQA review process is not complete until all discretionary approvals are

25 granted.
26
"Whether an initial environmental document remains relevant despite changed 27

28 plans or circumstances . is a predominately factual question" for the agency to first

answer. "A court's task on review is then to decide whether the agency's determination

- 25 -

1 is supported by substantial evidence; the court's job *js not to weigh conflicting

2 evidence and determine who has the better argument."' [Citation.]" (Friends of College

3 of San Mateo Gardens v. San Mateo County Community College Dist. (2016) 1 Cal.5th

4 937, 953.)

6 In 2017, in an effort to obtain the City's approval of a General Plan Amendment

7 and CUP, the proposed solar farm project was moved 660 feet north to comply with City

8 zoning requirements that preclude solar farms within 660 feet ofen agricultural or

9 residentially designated property. (AR 41:2636-3106; AR-42:3104 106; AR.44.3121-
10 3123; AR 48:3654-3656.) As moved, the project has the same siqn and layout, but
11

12 requires additional trenching to install electrical duit to connect to SCE facilities. (AR

13 82:6966.) As part of seeking a General Plan Amendm and CUP, the District adopted

14 an Addendum to the IS/MND. (AR 42:3' 4: 44:3124-3128.) Under the

15 Addendum, the District found the change project site would not result in any new
16 significant environmental offects triggering the eed for further environmental review. In
17

18 August 2017, the District filed posted the Notice of Determination. (AR 1:1-3;

19 42:3105-3106.)

20 The current project inolves essentially the same solar farm project proposed in

21 2017 th the issue being the qualified exemption under Government Code section
22

23 53096, surdivision (a). The District's June 2, 2020, Notice of Public Hearing stated that

24 the Board was •Iding a public hearing to consider adopting a Resolution that there is

25 no feasible alternative to the Hesperia Farms project pursuant to Government Code

26 section 53096. (AR 100:7677-7679.) The Agenda listed a similar description of the
27 public hearing related to adopting Resolution No. 2020-04. (AR 81:6961.) In the
28

- 26 -

1 District's June 2020 Resolution, the District noted that a CEQA review was completed

2 for the project in 2017. (AR 3:11-12.)

3 On July 2, 2020, following the feasibility hearing, the District filed and posted a

4 Notice of Determination stating that the project approved in August 2017 was fully
5
analyzed in the prior MND and Addendum, concluding that the project would not have a
6

7 significant effect on the environment. (AR 2:7-9.)

8 The Staff Report regarding Resolution No. 2020-04 discussed August 8,

9 2017, the Board adopted Resolution No. 2017-15 approving and adopting idum

10 No. 1 to the Final MND for the alternative site under CE and approving the
11

12 alternative site. It discussed the finding that the change in lo tion would not result in

13 any new significant environmental effect triggering the need for further environmental

14 review under Public Resources Code se 166 or State CEQA Guidelines section

15 15162. It also stated that the alternative sin subject to the same mitigation measuresl

16 as the original site. (AR 82:6966.) The June  20 Alternatives Report discussed the
17

18 prior environmental review protess and adoption of the Addendum in 2017. (AR 4:19,
19 21.)

20 The City's comments, ubmitted before the public hearing, raised an issue about

21 the exufonmental document failing to address "feasible alternatives." (AR 101:7707-
22
7708.) Bu the City's argument in its Opening Brief is not based on the failure to 23

24 address alterna wes as part of CEQA review. Instead, the City's challenge is based on

25 significant new information that requires further environmental review.

26 The City now claims that the District's Addendum to the MND is deficient

27 because it did not consider significant new information about the risk of the Mojave
28
River Dam failing. It asserts that the record lacks a discussion of this new information

- 27 -

1 published in November 2019 in which the Army Corps' News Release warned of greater

2 risk from the Mojave River Dam failing. The City contends the District is proceeding in a

3 manner not required by law because it failed to consider this new information and

4 instead relied on the 2017 Addendum.

5
The District argues that it complied with CEQA when it adopted the 2017
6

7 Addendum. The District contends that the City fails to demonstrate eexistence of

8 "new information" under Public Recourses Code section 21166 and 0 unes seotion

9 15162, subdivision (a). According to the District, the City failed to exhaust

10 administrative remedies; judicial notice cannot be taken the information on which the
11

12 City relies; and even if the City's claim is not barred by the farre to exhaust, there are

13 no subsequent discretionary approvals to trigger CEQA review.

14 B. The City Failed to Exhaust Adm tive Remedies.

15 The District is correct that the City fal to exhaust its administrative remedies

16 on this issue.
17

18 The City argues in its Reply that the District's decision to find alternatives

19 infeasible and prove the project under Government Code section 53096 is a
20 discretiona approv triggering the need for a CEQA determination. But this was not
21 the argument ra ed in the Zity's Opening Brief. The argument raised in the Opening
22
Brief was directed to sserting that the District failed to consider new significant
23

24 information, rendering reliance on the 2015 MND and 2017 Addendum deficient.

25 The court considers the City's argument made on reply only as it relates to the

26 District's exhaustion of administrative remedies defense. In other words, to the extent

27 the City asserts in its Reply that the District failed to make required CEQA findings in
28
approving the project, that argument is waived. But to the extent it is offered as a

- 28 -

1 reason that the significant new information argument was not raised earlier, it is

2 considered.

3 The 2020 approval is a discretionary approval to which CEQA applies, requiring

4 consideration whether one of the three triggering events for a supplemental or

5

6 subsequent EIR exists. Substantial evidence supports a conclusion that the solar

7 energy project as described and considered in the 2017 Addendum is the same project

8 approved in 2020. The only change in circumstance was the maaner under which

9 project approval was sought: the District's finding that the qualified xemption under
10 Government Code section 53096 applied rather than the City apr ovn the District's
11

12 application for a General Plan Amendment and IP. The question then is whether the

13 "significant new information" factor of Public Resource Code section 21166,

14 subdivision (c) and Guidelines section 15162, subdivision (a)(3), triggers subsequent

15 CEQA review.

16
Nothing in CEQA requires nency to make an explicit finding that the original
17

18 Il environmental document retains some de ree of relevance. (San Mateo Gardens,

19 supra, 1 Cal.5th p. 953, fn.4.) "When an agency considers a subsequent

20 Il discretionadaction a project, it will know whether changes are proposed in the

21 project but may unawa of changes in circumstances or new information of
22 importance to the pro, oct. Nothing in CEQA or the Guidelines requires the agency to 23

24 conduct an investigation to ferret out changes in circumstances or new information. If

25 the agency becomes aware of such factors, however, it should then consider all the

26 relevant facts and explicitly decide whether conditions exist that necessitate further

27 environmental review. If a project opponent is aware of changed circumstances or new
28
information, bringing that material to the agency's attention might obligate the agency to

- 29 -

1 conduct an investigation to determine whether further environmental review is required."

2 (Kostka & Zischke, Practice Under the California Environmental Quality Act (2d. ed. Cal.

3 CEB) § 19.37.)

4 The District made an implied finding of no changes to the project that require
5
further environmental review under Public Resources Code section 21166. The
6

7 District's 2020 Alternatives Report states: "No legal challenges were filed under CEQA

8 against the Original Site or the Alternative Site where the Propol I weuld be located.

9 Thus, the Final MND and Addendum are presumed valid under Purtic Resources Code

10 sections 21080.1 and 21167.2 and State CEQA Guidelines secin 231." (AR 4:29.)
11

12 "CEQA does not set forth any particular cedure to support an agency's

13 decision that a new EIR [or MND] is not required. CE does not require an initial

14 study or public hearing in these circumstances." (Committee for Re-Evaluation of T-

15 Line Loop v. San Francisco Mu Mpal Transportation Agency (2016) 6 Cal.App.5th
16 1237, 1256.) As explained in Kostka Zischke, Practice Under the California

18 Environmental Quality Act, supra, § 19.40 ""There is no specific requirement in CEQA

19 or the CEQA Graelines that public notice and an opportunity to comment be provided

1 In Santa Teresa Citizen Action Group V. City of San Jose (2003) 114 Cal.App.4th

2 689, 701-702, the Court found the exhaustion requirement of Public Resources Code

3 section 21177 did not apply where "there was no clearly defined administrative

4 procedure for petitioners to resolve their concerns about the project as if was finally
5

6 configured." But in several other cases, the Court has come to a contrary conclusion.

7 (ALARM, supra, 12 Cal.App.4th at p. 1804 ['"At no time during the administrative.

8 process did anyone .. suggest that a separate public hearing was required. ] Mani

9 Brothers Real Estate Group V. City of Los Angeles (2007) 53 Cal:App.4th 1385, 1394-

10 1395 [finding the exhaustion requirement applied where regula schedule meetings
11

12 open to the public were held, even if not"duly noticed public hearings under CEQA"].)19

13 In Bridges v. Mt. San Jacinto Community olleg istrict (2017) 14 Cal.App.5th 104,

14 117, the Court followed Mani Brothers, condr ding that the CEQA exhaustion

15 requirement was triggered en though there was not a public hearing held under
16 CEQA, where there
17 regurdly scheduled meeting that was open to the public.

18 There is no disput that a public hearing on the District's consideration of the

19 qualified exemption was poste as required. While the City argues that the District

20 fail provide adequate notice that an environmental decision would be made, a

21 public heam is not required for an implied finding of no subsequent environmental
22
review. In addition, the City was able to comment and generally asserted that the
23

24 CEQA document failed to address feasibility alternatives. (AR 101:7707-7708.) The

25 City had an opportunity during the administrative proceeding to raise its CEQA objection

26

27 19 Public Resources Code section 21177, setting for the exhaustion requirement, provides at
subdivision (e): "This section does not apply to any alleged grounds for noncompliance with this division
28 for which there was no public hearing or other opportunity for members of the public to raise those objections orally or in writing before the approval of the project, or if the public agency failed to give the notice required by law."

- 31 -

1 that significant new information existed but failed to do so. It has failed to show CEQA's

2 exhaustion exception applies. This issue is barred by the failure to exhaust

3 administrative remedies.

4 C. There is No Basis for Finding the Existence of Significant New Information.
5
In Bridges, even though the court found the failure to exhaust, the court went on
6

7 to evaluate the merits of the CEQA claim as if exhaustion did not ap (Bridges,

8 supra, 14 Cal.App.5th at pp. 118-126.) Here, even if the exhaustion if sion did not

9 preclude the City's claim, the CEQA argument lacks merit.

10 First, there is no statutory basis for the City's reqeast for judicial notice of the
11

12 November 2019 News Release, and the City does not explan why it failed to seek to

13 augment the administrative record prior to briefing on the merits.

14 But even if the court were to cons News Release, it is insufficient to

15 trigger subsequent environmental analysis. QA analysis is concerned with a
16
project's impact on the environment, rather tha with the environment's impact on a
17

18 project and its users or reside (California Building Industry Association V. Bay Area

19 Air Quality Managemen DISUO 5 62 Cal.4th 369, 378.) CEQA does not require

20 analysis of fhe impact of exn environmental conditions on a project's future users or

21 resida (ld. at p. 377.) Guidelines section 15126.2, subdivision (a), is consistent with
22
the ruling California Building Industry Association.
23

24 Given th an MND is at issue, the News Release's discussion of a new

25 assessed increased risk of flooding during an extreme flood event does not constitute
26 substantial evidence in favor of a fair argument that a new significant environmental

27 impact from the project may occur. (San Mateo Gardens, supra, 1 Cal.5th at p. 959.)
28
The increased flood assessment risk is not new information of substantial importance

- 32 -

1 because it does not constitute substantial evidence that the project may exacerbate the

2 existing flooding risk. Therefore, the City's CEQA argument is without merit.
