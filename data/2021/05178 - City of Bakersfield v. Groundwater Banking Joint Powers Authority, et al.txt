GROUNDWATER BANKING JOINT POWERS

23 Petitioner and Plaintiff City of Bakersfield ("City" or "Bakersfield") alleges as follows:

24 INTRODUCTION

25 1. Through this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory

26 and Injunctive Relief, the City challenges the decisions of the Groundwater Banking Joint Powers

27 Authority (*JPA"), the Rosedale-Rio Bravo Water Storage District ("Rosedale"), and the Irvine

28 Ranch Water District ("Irvine") (the JPA, Rosedale and Irvine are referred to collectively herein as
-1-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

I "Respondents") to approve and certify a legally inadequate, incomplete and erroneous

2 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for a significant and harmful water conveyance, recharge and

3 recovery project. As explained herein, Respondents have proposed and approved a project, entitled

4 the "Kern Fan Groundwater Storage Project" (hereinafter "Project"), which will alter and affect the

5 environment in Kern County, and threaten the water supply of the City, Kern County, and the Kern

6 River, without undertaking proper or meaningful review of the environmental impacts of the Project,

7 in violation of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code Section

8 21000 et seq.).

9 2. The Project is intended to capture, recharge and store water from various state and

10 federal sources, and local water supplies, including the Kern River, and to later extract the stored and

11 banked water supplies to serve residents and customers of Irvine and Rosedale. Among other things,

12 Respondents propose to construct recharge, conveyance and recovery equipment and facilities, to

13 divert, recharge and store "surplus surface water" from various sources, including the Kern River,

14 and to provide Rosedale's and Irvine's customers "with increased water supply reliability during

15 periods when other supply sources may be reduced or interrupted." (Draft Environmental Impact

16 Report ("DEIR"), p. 2-3.)

17 3. The Project would deprive the City and the region of a significant supply and source

18 of drinking water for its citizens, threaten the local environment and the habitat along the Kern

19 River, degrade the quality of drinking water in the region, and threaten the water supply for the

20 entire region. Despite these significant and far reaching impacts, Respondents have failed to conduct
21 proper, meaningful or complete review of the environmental impacts and consequences of the

22 Project. Respondents have instead prepared and approved an EIR in connection with the Project

23 which does not comply with the policy, purpose or specific requirements of CEQA. Among other

24 deficiencies, the EIR is filled with numerous factual errors and omissions, and is misleading and

25 confusing. The EIR fails to present a clear or consistent description of the Project, the purported

26 goals of the Project, or the environmental impacts of the Project. The EIR also fails to properly

27 consider reasonable, feasible alternatives for the Project, including the "no project" alternative.
28
-2-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 4. In sharp contrast to the underlying purpose and principles of CEQA, Respondents

2 have attempted, through the EIR, to obscure and hide the details of the Project, to avoid addressing

3 the actual goals and purpose of the Project, and to avoid or minimize any real analysis of the

4 Project's impact on the environment. Respondents are essentially attempting to undertake this

5 significant project in secret, without any meaningful public review or participation. This lack of

6 candor and accurate information is particularly troubling because one of the "components" of the

7 Project would involve the sale or transfer of valuable Kern River water out of the area, to Southern

8 California. Respondents are apparently attempting to use the EIR process not to inform the public,

9 but to confuse the public and to hide the details and impacts of their water transfers and sales to

10 Southern California.

11 5. Through this action, the City seeks a writ of mandate commanding Respondents to set

12 aside their certification of the deficient, incomplete and misleading EIR, and Respondents' approval

13 of the Project based on the improper EIR, and related actions. The City will suffer immediate and

14 irreparable harm if the Court does not grant the City its requested relief. The City also seeks a

15 preliminary and permanent injunction barring Respondents from undertaking any activity with

16 regard to the Project and any activity which could potentially alter the physical and natural
17 environment in Kern County.

18 6. This proceeding involves enforcement of important rights affecting the public

19 interest. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition and Complaint will confer a substantial

20 benefit on the public, including citizens, residents, businesses and taxpayers of Kern County, and

21 will result in the enforcement of important public rights by requiring Respondents to comply with

22 CEQA and other legal requirements applicable to the proposed Project, by voiding the Project
23 approvals and by prohibiting Respondents from taking further actions with respect to the Project
24 until they have complied with those legal requirements.

25 PARTIES

26 7. Bakersfield is a charter city of the State of California and is municipal corporation

27 organized and existing under the laws of the State of California. Bakersfield is located within the

28
-3-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- County of Kern, State of California.

2 8.

3 The City supplies its residents with drinking water and water for other municipal uses

4 primarily through direct diversions of high quality water from the Kern River, and through indirect

5 diversions of Kern River water that has seeped or been recharged into the groundwater basin

6 underlying the City. The Kern River also serves as an important aesthetic, environmental, biological
and recreational resource for the City and its residents.

7 9.

8 The City brings this action on its own behalf and on behalf of its citizens, residents,

9 customers and landowners, who are citizens and taxpayers of the State of California. The City has a

10 direct and beneficial interest in Respondents' compliance with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.

11 The City and its residents would suffer adverse impacts from Respondents' actions in approving the

12 Project without proper environmental review or appropriate mitigation measures, including loss of

13 water that the City has historically diverted and used, a loss of water which would otherwise flow in

14 the Kern River channel through the City, a degradation in the quality of drinking water in the area,

15 impacts on groundwater resources, impacts on wildlife habitat and the Kern River riparian habitat,

16 and irreparable harm resulting from the loss of a critically important and valuable water supply.
10.

17 Rosedale is a public entity and California Water Storage District organized and

18 operating pursuant to the California Water Storage District Law (Water Code § 39000 et seq.).
Rosedale is located within Kern County, in the State of California.

19 11.

20 Irvine is a public entity and California Water District organized and operating

21 pursuant to the California Water District Law. (Water Code, § 34000 et seq.) Irvine is located
within Orange County, in the State of California.

22 12.

23 Rosedale and Irvine formed the JPA for the sole purpose of developing,

24 implementing and operating the Project. The JPA is a Joint Powers Authority organized and

25 operating pursuant to the Joint Exercise of Powers Act. (Gov. Code, § 6500 et seq.)

13.

26 Respondents are governmental agencies of the State of California, and are subject to

27 and bound by the requirements of CEQA. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21063.) The Board of Directors

28 of Respondents are the governing bodies of the entities and are authorized and required by law to

-4-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

hold public hearings and to determine the adequacy of and certify environmental documents under

2 CEQA and to take other actions with respect to the approval of "projects," as defined by CEQA,

3 within their authority and jurisdiction.

14. The City is unaware of the true names or capacities of the parties fictitiously sued

5 herein as DOES through 30, inclusive, and will amend this Petition and Complaint to set forth thein

6 true names and capacities when the same have been ascertained. The City is informed and believes,

7 and thereon alleges, that said fictitiously named parties have some interest in the subject of this

8 Petition and Complaint, by reason of which said fictitiously named parties are subject to the relief

9 prayed for herein.

10 VENUE AND JURISDICTION

11 15. A Petition for Writ of Mandate is authorized by Public Resources Code Sections

12 21168 and 21168.5 and Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1085 and 1094.5, and this Court has

13 jurisdiction to vacate Respondents' filing of a Notice of Determination, certification of the EIR, and

14 approval of the Project by the Boards of Directors of Respondents pursuant to these statutes and the
15 provisions of CEQA.

16 16. Venue is appropriate in Kern County pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section

17 394 because the Project is located within the county and the Project will cause significant adverse

18 environmental impacts in the county.

19 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

20 17. The City submitted written comments to the Notice of Preparation for the EIR on

21 May 8, 2020, and on November 30, 2020, the City submitted extensive written comments regarding

22 the DEIR to Respondents.

23 18. The City has otherwise performed any and all conditions precedent to the filing of

24 this Petition and Complaint and has fully exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the extent

25 required by law in that the determinations by Respondents are final and no further administrative

26 appeal procedures are provided by state or local law. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21177(a).)

27

28
-5-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 NOTICE

2 19. On January 4, 2021, Respondents filed a "Notice of Determination" regarding the

3 Project with the Clerk of the County of Kern.

4 20. The City has filed this action within 30 days of the filing of the Notice of

5 Determination, as required by Public Resources Code Sections 21167(b)-(c).

6 21. On January 21, 2021, prior to commencement of this action, the City served written

7 notice of the commencement of this action on Respondent s pursuant to Public Resources Code

8 Section 21167.5. (A true and correct copy of the notice to Respondents is attached hereto as Exhibit

9 A.)

10 22. On February 2, 2021, the City notified the Attorney General of the State of California

11 of the filing of this Petition and Complaint and furnished him with a copy of the document in

12 accordance with the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.7. (A true and correct

13 copy of the form of the notice to the Attorney General is attached hereto as Exhibit B.)

14 23. Following the filing of this Petition and Complaint, the City will file a request for
15 preparation of the record of the administrative proceedings relating to this action with Respondents

16 in accordance with the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.6(a), and a request for

17 a hearing, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21167.4.

18 ATTORNEYS' FEES

19 24. The City is entitled to recover attorneys' fees from Respondents pursuant to Code of

20 Civil Procedure Section 1021.5 because this action will confer a significant benefit on the general

21 public and a large class of persons, and the necessity and burden of private enforcement is such as to

22 make an award of fees appropriate.

23 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

24 Bakersfield and the Kern River

25 25. The Kern River ("Kern River" or "River") is a natural watercourse originating in the

26 Sierra Nevada mountain range in Central California. The River flows through the foothills and into

27 the southern San Joaquin Valley a few miles northeast of the City. The River then flows to the

28
-6-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 southwest through the City to a point about 20 miles distant, where in wet years it turns northwest
and flows toward Tulare Lake.

3 26.

4 The City is a charter city of the State of California and was originally incorporated in
1873. The Kern River runs through the center of the City. The City and its residents have

5 continuously and constantly diverted, appropriated and extracted waters from the Kern River and

6

7 from the ground water basin underlying the metropolitan area of the City to meet the water needs of
the City and its residents.

8 27. Bakersfield has experienced significant and rapid population growth, and the

9

10 geographic boundaries of the City have expanded to encompass the growing population. Bakersfield
is currently the ninth largest city in the State of California and within the last decade has been

11

12 recognized as one of the fastest growing cities in the state, if not the entire country. Bakersfield
currently has approximately 392,000 residents.

13 28.

14 Bakersfield's continued growth, success and survival is directly dependent on the

15 continued availability of a high quality, reliable supply of water from the Kern River. As
Bakersfield continues to

16 grow and expand, it must utilize and develop increasing quantities of water
accruing to its Kern River water rights.

17 29.

18 Since 1976, the City's demand for water has increased significantly. In addition to

19 increased demands for drinking water by residents, agricultural use of water in the region has

20 increased significantly as new lands have gone into production as a result of modern farming
techniques.

21 30. Increased municipal and agricultural demands have resulted in a decreased and

22

23 declining groundwater supply in the region, and has resulted in declining and diminished flows of

24 water in the Kern River. The State of California has determined that the groundwater basin under

25 the City is critically overdrafted, which occurs when groundwater extractions exceed the supply of

26 water flowing into the basin, typically through rainfall, stream flows and recharge programs.

27 Groundwater overdraft in a basin typically results in reduced groundwater levels, with corresponding
impacts on the available water supply and water quality.

28
-7-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

I 31. Sales and transfers of local water supplies, in particular Kern River water supplies,

2 out of the County are directly contrary to the policies and interests of the City, and are highly

3 damaging to the local water supply, groundwater basin and environment. The City has a long

4 standing policy, most recently confirmed in 2001, that Kern River water shall not be utilized outside

5 the boundaries of the San Joaquin Valley portion of Kern County. The City also has a long-standing

6 policy of increasing and restoring flows of water in the Kern River, for the benefit of its residents,

7 the local water supply, and the environment in and around the Kern River channel.

32. The City has consistently advocated for an increase of water flowing in the Kern

9 River channel. The City's acquisition of its Kern River water rights and supplies in 1976 was

10 motivated in large part by the City's desire and interest to increase flows of Kern River water in

11 order to replenish and protect the City's groundwater supplies, and to serve other reasonable

12 beneficial uses. The City has adopted policies calling for increased Kern River flows, and has

13 implemented a number of projects intended to increase Kern River flows and to protect and enhance

14 the environment in and around the Kern River channel.

15 33. On or about April 12, 1976, Bakersfield entered into a written agreement

16 (*Agreement No. 76-36"), entitled "Agreement By and Between City of Bakersfield, City of

17 Bakersfield Water Facilities Corporation, Tenneco West, Inc., Kern Island Water Company and

18 Kern River Canal and Irrigating Company," whereby, among other things, Bakersfield acquired all

19 of the Kern River water rights and interests provided for in the Miller-Haggin Agreement and the

20 "Shaw Decree" held by Tenneco West, Inc. ("Tenneco"), and the other parties to the agreement, and

21 previously held by the Kern County Land Company ("KCLC"), all of whom were successors-in-

22 interest to the parties to the Miller-Haggin Agreement and the Shaw Decree.

23 34. Pursuant to Agreement No. 76-36, Bakersfield became successor-in-interest and

24 assumed all rights, duties and obligations of Tenneco, and previously KCLC, pursuant to a number

25 of agreements related to the Kern River, including, but not limited to, an August 31, 1961 water

26 service agreement between Rosedale, on the one hand, and various subsidiary canal companies

27 owned and held by KCLC, and later Tenneco ("1961 Agreement"), to allow Rosedale to purchase

28
-8-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 and use an average of 10,000 acre-feet of water accruing to the water rights formerly held by KCLC

2 and now held and owned by Bakersfield.

35. Rosedale does not hold or own any Kern River water rights, and in most years

4 Rosedale only receives Kern River water through the 1961 Agreement. Irvine and the JPA also do
not hold or own any Kern River water rights.
The Current Project

7 36. On April 8, 2020, Respondents issued a Notice of Preparation ("NOP") for an EIR for

8 the Project. In the NOP, Respondents explained that the Project would allow Rosedale and Irvine

9 "to more effectively manage sources of water supply by using available underground storage in the

10 local San Joaquin Valley Groundwater Basin." The NOP further stated that the Project would

11 involve the development of "a water bank and associated water conveyance facilities in the Kern Fan

12 area of Kern County, California," and that the Project "would recharge, store, recover, and deliver

13 State Water Project (SWP) water, including Article 21 water, and water from other sources when

14 available," for "agricultural, municipal and industrial uses."

15 37. On May 8, 2020, the City submitted comments to the NOP for the Project. In the

16 comments, the City noted that the NOP indicated that the Project would involve the storage and
17 eventual transfer of Kern River water out of the County to Irvine. The City urged Respondents, in

18 the EIR for the Project, "to accurately, honestly and completely review the wide ranging potential

19 impacts of the proposed transfer of local water supplies, including Kern River water, out of the area,

20 to Southern California." The City also stated that the EIR should properly explore and explain

21 impacts of the Project on the goals, policies and requirements of the Sustainable Groundwater

22 Management Act (*SGMA"), the specific water supplies that would be used in the Project, impacts

23 of the Project on the City and its water supplies, and additional issues and matters.

24 38. In the DEIR, Respondents explained that the Project "would consist of construction

25 of up to 1,300 acres of recharge basin facilities and up to 12 recovery wells on the Kern Fan Project

26 Properties," including "canals and/or pipelines, pump stations and a new turnout at the California

27 Aqueduct to convey water between the project facilities and the California Aqueduct." (DEIR, p.

28
-9-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 ES-6.) Respondents also explained: "The proposed project would be operated such that surplus

2 surface water from the SWP, CVP, Kern River and other available water sources would be recharged

3 and stored for subsequent recovery. It is estimated that the project may be able to recharge and store

4 upwards of 100,000 acre-feet per year (AFY)." (Id.)

5 39. The DEIR also stated that Kern River water "available" to Irvine through

6 "agreement(s) with existing right holders" will be recharged, stored, recovered and delivered through

7 the Project, including to Irvine's service area in Southern California. (DEIR, p. 2-1.) The DEIR

8 further indicated that up to 37,500 acre-feet of "storage capacity" in the Project will be shared

9 equally between Rosedale and Irvine, and that Irvine will use water held in that "account" for "M&I

10 uses." (DEIR, p. ES-7.)

11 The Draft and Final EIR

12 40. On October 16, 2020, Respondents issued a Notice of Availability indicating that the

13 Draft EIR for the Project had been prepared and was available for review and comment.

14 41. On November 30, 2020, the City submitted extensive comments to the Draft EIR. In

15 the comments, the City explained that it had significant practical, operational and legal concerns

16 with regard to the Project.

17 42. The City also explained in its comments that it had significant concerns with regard to

18 the DEIR, as the DEIR did not comply with the policy, purpose or specific requirements of CEQA.

19 Among other deficiencies, the DEIR was filled with numerous factual errors and omissions, and was

20 misleading and confusing. The DEIR failed to present a clear or consistent description of the

21 Project, the purported goals of the Project, or the environmental impacts of the Project. The DEIR

22 also failed to properly consider reasonable, feasible alternatives for the Project, including the "no

23 project" alternative.

24 43. In its comments the City again expressed concern that the Project involved the

25 transfer or sale of local water supplies, including the waters of the Kern River, out of Kern County,

26 in violation of the City's policy.

27

28
-10-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

I 44. The City also expressed concern that the Project would violate SGMA "by

2 contributing to and exacerbating overdraft conditions in the Kern Subbasin, and by contributing to

3 adverse groundwater conditions, including through lowered groundwater levels, loss of local water

4 supplies and increased, unsustainable groundwater pumping." The City also noted that: "The DEIR

5 fails to consider any of those impacts, and instead simply assumes, and argues, without any

6 supporting data, that the Project will 'help support' groundwater sustainability efforts."

7 45. In its comments the City also explained that the DEIR failed "to identify, explain and

8 analyze in sufficient or required detail the specific sources of water that will be utilized in the

9 Project, and the impacts associated with the use of those water supplies."

10 46. The City also stated that the Project would "necessarily have significant impacts on

11 the City, as well as Kern River water supplies, including banked and stored Kern River water,

12 utilized by the City. The Project will also likely impact the City's ability to store and extract banked

13 Kern River water supplies for municipal and domestic uses. The Project will also likely affect flows

14 of Kern River, and the environment in and around the Kern River within the City." The City further

15 explained: "Despite these significant impacts, the DEIR fails to mention, consider or account for the

16 impacts of the Project on the City, the residents of the City, the City's water supply, and the

17 environment in and around the City, including, most importantly, in and around the Kern River

18 channel."

19 47. In its comments, the City identified a number of other errors, omissions, and

20 deficiencies with the DEIR, and stated that Respondents had not complied with the requirements of

21 CEQA, and applicable provisions of California law.

22 48. On December 18, 2020, the City received the Final EIR for the Project ("FEIR"),
23 which contained Respondents' response to the City's comments to the DEIR.

24 49. Respondents' responses to the City's comments did not address or satisfy the City's

25 concerns and objections with regard to the DEIR and the Project. Respondents did not make

26 necessary and requested changes to the EIR, and the FEIR instead generally exacerbated and

27 perpetuated the errors, omissions and deficiencies in the DEIR.

28
-11-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- 50.

2 In its response to the City's comments to the DEIR, Respondents claimed: "The

3 Project Description does not include any transfer of local water supplies to IRWD nor does it

4 propose any out-of-county water sales or transfers at all. Therefore, the suggested impacts to the

5 local environment associated with transfer or sale of local water supplies are non-existent." (FEIR,

6 p. 10-50.) In the very next sentence, however, Respondents directly contradicted that statement and

7 admitted that the Project "may" involve the transfer of local Kern River water supplies to Irvine, in

8 Southern California. Respondents explained: "Water recharged in the project for later recovery by

9 IRWD may or may not include Kern River water." (Id.) Respondents further explained that the

10 Project would involve the use of Kern River water obtained by Respondents "when available from

11 water right holders under banking or temporary water service agreements or when the Kern River is

12 in high-flow conditions (Section 2.4.2 page 2-10), depending on annual hydrologic availability,
water rights and regulatory considerations." (Id.)

13 51.

14 At a December 28, 2020 special meeting of their Boards of Directors, Respondents

15 adopted "written findings pursuant to CEQA," a "mitigation, monitoring and reporting program,"
and considered and approved the FEIR and the Project.

16 52.

17 On January 4, 2021, Respondents filed a Notice of Determination ("NOD")

18 evidencing the approval of the Project and certification and approval of the EIR with the Clerk of the
County of Kern.

19 53.

20 Respondents' actions in certifying the EIR and approving the Project constitute a

21 prejudicial abuse of discretion because Respondents failed to proceed in a manner required by law,

22 their actions are not supported by adequate findings, and their actions and findings are not supported
by substantial evidence, in each of the respects enumerated herein.

23 54.

24 The City is entitled to a writ of mandate that the EIR certification and Project

25 approval be vacated and set aside and enjoining and ordering Respondents to refrain from

26 proceeding any further with the Project, unless and until Respondents comply with CEQA and
undertake a

27 proper and complete environmental review of the Project, including preparation of a

28 new, complete EIR. The City is additionally entitled to an order, pursuant to Public Resources Code

-12-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

I Section 21168.9, directing Respondents to reconsider or change the Project pending proper

2 environmental review, to take specific action to bring their determinations, findings and decisions

3 with regard to the Project into compliance with CEQA, to take corrective action to cure the

4 deficiencies in Respondents' consideration and approval of the Project, and to take other corrective,

5 remedial action in accordance with Public Resources Code Section 21168.9.

6 55. The City does not have a plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course

7 of law because the City, the public and the local region will be irreparably harmed by the ensuing

8 environmental damage and by Respondents' violations of CEQA and related laws. Accordingly, the

9 City seeks injunctive relief, along with the requested writ of mandate, to prevent the irreparable

10 harm that would result from commencement of the Project without proper or sufficient

11 environmental review.

12 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
13 (Writ of Mandate C.C.P. §§ 1085 and 1094.5) (Violation of CEQA Improper Approval of Project Based on Deficient EIR)
14

15 56. The City realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, each and every

16 allegation in paragraphs 1 through 55 of this Petition and Complaint.

17 57. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA (Public Resources Code Section

18 a 21000 et seq.) as a means of requiring public agency decision makers such as Respondents to

19 document and consider the environmental implications of their actions. CEQA's fundamental goal

20 is to fully inform the public and the decision makers as to the environmental consequences of its

21 actions and to assure members of the public that government officials are making informed

22 decisions.

23 58. The EIR requirement is the heart of CEQA. The primary function of the EIR is to

24 provide discussion and disclosure of the adverse environmental impacts which may result from a

25 project proposed or approved by a public agency, and to inform decision makers, responsible

26 agencies and the general public of mitigation and alternatives to the project that would lessen the

I serious environmental consequences. The EIR serves not only to protect the environment, but also

2 to demonstrate to the public that the environment is being protected. (14 Cal. Code Regs. §15003.)

3 59. The EIR is intended to demonstrate to an apprehensive citizenry that the reviewing

4 agency has, in fact, analyzed and considered the ecological implications of its actions and that its

5 decision was an independent one, not one based upon public pressure, political and economic

6 concerns, or lobbying and undue influence. The purpose of CEQA is to compel government

7 agencies to make decisions with environmental consequences in mind. (14 Cal. Code Regs.

8 §15003.)

9 60. The fundamental purpose of an EIR is "to provide public agencies and the public in
10 general with detailed information about the effect which a proposed project is likely to have on the

11 environment." (Pub. Resources Code, § 21061.) Full and candid disclosure, and an honest

12 assessment of the environmental consequences of governmental action, is the foundation of the

13 CEQA process. The foremost principle under CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act "to be

14 interpreted in such manner as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the

15 reasonable scope of the statutory language." (Friends of Mammoth v. Board of Supervisors (1972) 8
16 Cal.3d 247, 259.)

17 61. In sharp contrast to the underlying purpose and principles of CEQA, Respondents

18 have attempted, through the EIR, to obscure and hide the details of the Project, to avoid addressing

19 the actual goals and purpose of the Project, and to avoid or minimize any real analysis of the

20 Project's impact on the environment. Respondents are proposing to undertake a project that could
21 have a significant negative impact on the Kern River, the environment and natural resources of Kern

22 County and the southern San Joaquin Valley. Respondents are essentially attempting to undertake

23 this significant project in secret, without any meaningful public review or participation.

24 62. This lack of candor and accurate information is particularly troubling because the

25 Project involves and calls for the transfer of valuable Kern River water out of the area, to Orange

26 County, within the service area of Irvine. Respondents are apparently attempting to use the EIR
27 process not to inform the public, but to confuse the public and to hide the details and impacts of this

28
-14-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 water transfer to Southern California. Kern County is faced with a potential repeat of the events that

2 occurred in the Owens Valley in the early part of the last century, as powerful Los Angeles interests

3 are apparently again attempting to remove a valuable natural resource before the public becomes

4 aware of the threatened loss.

63. Respondents' actions in certifying the EIR and approving the Project constitute a

6 prejudicial abuse of discretion and a violation of CEQA because Respondents failed to proceed in a

7 manner required by law, their actions are not supported by adequate findings, and their actions and

8 findings are not supported by substantial evidence, in that the EIR is misleading, inaccurate,

9 inadequate and incomplete, and consequently does not comply with the requirements of CEQA.

10 64. In each of the respects enumerated above, Respondents violated their duties under

11 CEQA, abused their discretion, failed to proceed in a manner required by law, and decided the
12 matters complained of without the support of substantial evidence. Accordingly, the Court must set

13 aside Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

14 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
15 (Writ of Mandate C.C.P. §§ 1085 and 1094.5) (Violation of CEQA - Inadequate Project Description)
16 65. The City realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, each and every
17 allegation in paragraphs through 64 of this Petition and Complaint.
18 66. CEQA, and specifically Public Resources Code Sections 21151 and 21065 and 14
19 California Code of Regulations Section 15378(a), requires that an EIR accurately and concisely
20 present the location, boundaries, objectives and characteristics of a proposed project.
21 67. An EIR must contain an accurate and consistent project description. (14 Cal. Code.
22 Regs. § 15124.) An accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an
23 informative, legally adequate environmental document. (County of Inyo V. City of Los Angeles
24 (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 193.) The adequacy of a project description is closely linked to the
25 adequacy of an environmental document's analysis of environmental effects. (Laurel Heights
26 Improvement Ass 'n. of San Francisco, Inc. v. The Regents of the University of California (1988) 47
27 Cal.3d 376, 398-399.)
28
-15-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 68. An inaccurate project description constitutes prejudicial abuse of discretion because

2 it precludes meaningful evaluation of the environmental consequences of a proposed project (both

3 by the public and the decision makers). (Sierra Club v. State Bd. of Forestry (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1215,

4 1236-1237.) An environmental document with an inaccurate and/or inconsistent project description

5 precludes meaningful evaluation of environmental consequences by failing to provide a full

6 disclosure of the information necessary to investigate and evaluate such consequences. "[O]nly

7 through an accurate view of the project may the public and interested parties and public agencies

8 balance the proposed project's benefits against its environmental cost, consider appropriate

9 mitigation measures, assess the advantages of terminating the proposal and properly weigh other

10 alternatives ...." (City of Santee v. County of San Diego (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1438, 1454.)

l1 69. CEQA defines a "project" as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for

12 resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment or a reasonably foreseeable indirect

13 physical change in the environment." (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15378(a).) A complete project

14 description is necessary to ensure that all of the project's environmental impacts are considered.

15 (City of Santee, supra, 214 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1454-55.)

16 70. Without an accurate description on which to base the EIR's analysis, CEQA's

17 objective of furthering public disclosure and informed environmental decision making are stymied.

18 "An accurate project description is necessary for an intelligent evaluation of the potential

19 environmental effects of a proposed activity." (San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center v.

20 County of Stanislaus (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 713, 730.)

21 71. An EIR's project description must provide "enough information to ascertain the

22 project's environmentally significant effects, assess ways of mitigating them, and consider project

23 alternatives." (Sierra Club v. City of Orange (2008) 163 Cal.App.4th 523, 533.) California courts

24 have frequently stated that "[o]nly through an accurate view of the project may affected outsiders

25 and public decision-makers balance the proposal's benefit against its environmental cost, consider

26 mitigation measures, assess the advantage of terminating the proposal . and weigh other

27 alternatives in the balance" and that "[a]n accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine

28
-16-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

l qua non of an informative and legally sufficient EIR." (County of Inyo, supra, 71 Cal.App.3d at pp.

2 192-193; Santiago County Water Dist. v. County of Orange (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d. 818, 830.)

3 72. The EIR for the Project violates and does not comply with the CEQA requirements

4 and obligations for an accurate, complete and proper project description because the EIR fails to

5 provide necessary and important details regarding the Project, the sources of water for the Project, or

6 the intended and expected use of water produced by the Project.

73. In the EIR, Respondents only provide a very general description of the sources of

8 water for the Project. The EIR does not identify the specific water supplies proposed for use in the

9 Project, the sources of the water, or the water rights and nature of the water rights associated with the

10 supplies that will be used in the Project. The EIR fails to identify the current uses of the water

11 supplies proposed for use in the Project. The EIR only provides a very general, vague description of

12 the acquisition, use and transfer of water related to the Project, and the intended destination and uses

13 of water produced by the Project.

14 74. The EIR also fails to provide any information on the Kern River water supplies that

15 will be used in the Project, or the nature and extent of the Kern River supplies proposed for use in
16 the Project. The EIR in general fails to identify and discuss Kern River water rights, current right

17 holders, current and competing uses of Kern River water proposed for use in the Project, and related

18 information. The EIR fails to provide necessary information with regard to the operation and

19 management of the Kern River, and the prior rights and agreements that govern and regulate the

20 Kern River. The EIR fails to identify the parties that are currently using Kern River water supplies

21 proposed for use in the Project, and fails to discuss or disclose the sources of water that would

22 replace or substitute for the supplies that will be used in the Project. The EIR also fails to

23 sufficiently explain how, when and to what extent "surplus surface water from the SWP, CVP, Kern

24 River, and other available water sources" would be available for use in the Project, or would be used
25 in the Project.

26 75. The EIR's failure to provide information regarding water supplies for the project,

27 Kern River water rights and supplies, and the use of water from the Kern River, is contrary to the

28
-17-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

I intent and requirements of CEQA. The California Supreme Court has recognized that "the future

2 water sources for a large land use project and the impacts of exploiting those sources are not the type

3 of information that can be deferred for future analysis." (Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible

4 Growth, Inc. v. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 431.)

5 76. Courts have previously invalidated EIRs that did not contain sufficient information

6 and details about water supplies proposed for use in project, and which did not adequately discuss
uncertainties associated with water supplies. (See, e.g., Planning & Conservation League v.

8 Department of Water Resources (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 892, 908, fn. 5 [noting that State Water

9 Project entitlements represent nothing more than "hopes, expectations, water futures or, as the

10 parties refer to them, 'paper water"]; Santa Clarita Organization for Planning the Environment v.

11 County of Los Angeles (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 715, 722-723 [holding that an EIR's water supply

12 discussion was inadequate because of its assumption that 100 percent of a party's State Water

13 Project ("SWP") entitlement would be available]; California Oak Foundation (2005) 133

14 Cal.App.4th 1219, 1238-1239, 1244 [rejecting an EIR for an industrial park because the water

15 supply analysis relied, without adequate consideration of the uncertainties of SWP supplies, on the

16 party's purchase of 41,000 acre-feet in imported SWP water supplies].)

17 77. Without relevant or accurate information regarding the status and extent of Kern

18 River water rights, it is not possible to determine how the Project will impact the existing Kern Riven

19 water rights, or water right holders. It is also impossible to determine from the EIR how the Project

20 will actually impact Kern River water supplies and other local water supplies. The EIR is therefore

21 woefully incomplete and deficient, and fails to comply with basic CEQA requirements.

22 78. The EIR fails to provide any specific details beyond those very vague and general

23 descriptions regarding the intended use of water produced by the Project by Rosedale and Irvine.

24 This is particularly troubling and deficient because the EIR provides no specific information

25 regarding Irvine's proposed use of water supplies, including local Kern River supplies, to satisfy

26 municipal uses within Irvine's Orange County service area.

27

28
-18-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 79. The EIR fails to include other necessary and significant details regarding the Project,

2 including the location and specific details of the recharge and recovery facilities for the Project,

3 details regarding the rate and amount of water recharged and recovered in connection with the

4 Project, details regarding proposed exchanges involving water produced by the Project, the
objectives and goals of the Project, and details or information regarding the extraction and use of

6 water from the Project by Irvine.

80. Respondents' failure to include important Project details and information in the EIR
also constitutes improper "piecemealing" of environmental review, in violation of CEQA. A lead

9 agency may not split a single large project into small pieces SO as to avoid environmental review of

10 the entire project. (Orinda Association V. Board of Supervisors (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 1145, 1171-

11 72.) "Courts have considered separate activities as one CEQA project and required them to be

12 reviewed together where, for example, the second activity is a reasonably foreseeable consequence

13 of the first activity." (Sierra Club V. West Side Irrigation Dist. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 690, 698.)

14 81. Without a complete and accurate description of the Project, the public cannot

15 properly assess or review the impact of the Project on the environment. These failures precluded the

16 EIR from meaningfully analyzing the impacts of the Project on the existing environmental setting,

17 including those features of the existing environment described above, and deprived the public,

18 including the City, of an opportunity to understand and meaningfully comment on the Project and its

19 impacts on the existing environment, thereby rendering the analyses in the EIR of the Project and its

20 impacts inadequate.

21 82. Respondents' actions in certifying the EIR and approving the Project constitute a

22 prejudicial abuse of discretion and a violation a of CEQA because Respondents failed to proceed in a

23 manner required by law, their actions are not supported by adequate findings, and their actions and
24 findings are not supported by substantial evidence, in that the EIR is misleading, inaccurate,

25 inadequate and incomplete, and consequently does not comply with the requirements of CEQA.

26 83. In each of the respects enumerated above, Respondents violated their duties under

27 CEQA, abused their discretion, failed to proceed in a manner required by law, and decided the

28
-19-

-

2 matters complained of without the support of substantial evidence. Accordingly, the Court must set
aside Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

3 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

4 (Writ of Mandate -C.C.P. §§ 1085 and 1094.5)

5 (Violation of CEQA - Inadequate Description of Environmental Setting)

6 84. The City realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, each and every

7 allegation in paragraphs 1 through 83 of this Petition and Complaint.

8 85. An EIR must describe the environmental setting for a proposed project, to establish

9

10 the "baseline" that a lead agency uses to determine whether project impacts are significant. (14 Cal.
Code Regs. § 15125.) Specifically, the EIR must describe "the physical environmental conditions in

11 the vicinity of the project." (Id.) The description of physical and environmental conditions must

12 include both a local a and regional perspective. (Id.)

13 86. Establishment of the baseline is critical to a meaningful assessment of the
14 environmental impacts of a project, because the significance of environmental impacts cannot be

15 determined without setting the baseline. (Save Our Peninsula Commillee v. Monterey County Board

16

17 of Supervisors (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 99, 119.) The description should place special emphasis on
environmental resources that are rare or unique to the region and that would be affected by the

18 project. (Cal. Code Regs. § 15125(c); San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center, supra, 27

19 Cal.App.4th at pp. 722-23.)

20 87. Respondents' actions in certifying the EIR and approving the Project constitute a

21 prejudicial abuse of discretion because Respondents failed to provide an accurate, complete and

22 stable description of existing environmental conditions, or the "baseline" conditions, against which

23 to identify and assess the impacts of the Project.

24 88. The EIR either fails to provide any information on baseline conditions in the Project

25 area, or only provides a brief, general and incomplete description of baseline conditions. The EIR

26 does not set forth a clear or comprehensive description of baseline conditions within Rosedale and

27 Irvine, or surrounding the Kern River, the diversion and use of water from the River, or the local

28 groundwater basin. The EIR fails to describe current groundwater conditions, flow conditions in the
-20-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Kern River, the environment in and around the River, and the timing and frequency of diversions

2 from the River. Absent such information, the EIR cannot possibly properly or completely assess the

3 impact of the Project on the Kern River and the environment in and around the River.

4 89. The EIR's failure to identify current baseline conditions in and around the Kern
River, within Rosedale and Irvine, and in areas that will be impacted by the Project, is a fatal flaw to
the EIR. It is inconceivable that the EIR for such a significant water supply project, which calls for
and contemplates the change in use of significant quantities of Kern River water, would fail to

8 identify current baseline conditions for the Kern River. Absent that information, the EIR cannot

9 possibly properly consider the impacts of the Project on the local environment, and the local water

10 supply.

11 90. Respondents' actions in certifying the EIR and approving the Project constitute a

12 a prejudicial abuse of discretion and a violation of CEQA because Respondents failed to proceed in a

13 manner required by law, their actions are not supported by adequate findings, and their actions and

14 their findings are not supported by substantial evidence in that the EIR is misleading, inaccurate,

15 inadequate and incomplete, and consequently does not comply with the requirements of CEQA.

16 91. In each of the respects enumerated above, Respondents violated their duties under

17 CEQA, abused their discretion, failed to proceed in a manner required by law, and decided the

18 matters complained of without the support of substantial evidence. Accordingly, the Court must set

19 aside Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

20 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (Writ of Mandate C.C.P. §§ 1085 and 1094.5) (Violation of CEQA - Failure to Analyze Environmental Impacts of Project)
22 92. The City realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, each and every
23 allegation in paragraphs 1 through 91 of this Petition and Complaint.
24 93. Under CEQA, an EIR must identify and evaluate the direct, indirect and cumulative
25 environmental impacts of all phases of a project, and discuss ways of mitigating or avoiding those
26 effects. (14 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 15126, 15362.) The discussion must include relevant specifics of
27 the area, the resources involved, physical changes, alterations to ecological systems, changes

CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR

1 induced in population distribution, population concentration, and human use of land (including

2 commercial and residential development), health and safety problems caused by the physical

3 changes, and other aspects of the resource base such as water, historical resources, scenic quality,
and public services. (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15126.2.) An EIR must provide public agencies, and the

5 public in general, with detailed information about the effects a proposed project is likely to have on

6 the environment, including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, noise, and objects of historic or
aesthetic significance. (Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21060.5, 21061; Environmental Planning and

8 Information Council of Western El Dorado County, Inc. V. County of El Dorado (1982) 131

9 Cal.App.3d 350, 354-355.)

10 94. An EIR must be prepared with a sufficient degree of analysis to provide decision-

11 makers with the information needed to make an intelligent judgment concerning a project's

12 environmental impacts. (14 Cal. Code Regs. $15151; Napa Citizens for Honest Government v. Napal

13 County Board of Supervisors (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 342, 356.) An EIR should, when looked at as a

14 whole, provide a reasonable, good faith disclosure and analysis of the project's environmental

15 impacts. (Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n., supra, 47 Cal.3d at p. 392.)

16 95. Respondents' actions in certifying the EIR and approving the Project constitute a

17 prejudicial abuse of discretion in that Respondents failed to sufficiently and adequately identify and

18 assess the Project's impacts on the environment. Respondents have not made a good faith effort at

19 full disclosure. Instead, Respondents have attempted to obscure and hide the actual terms and

20 conditions of various elements of the Project, in an apparent effort to minimize opposition to the
21 Project's most controversial aspects.

22 96. The Project will have dramatic and significant impacts on the local environment.

23 Respondents will change historic practices of water diversion and use, including through new uses of

24 Kern River water, changes to the historic place of use of Kern River water, and transfers of Kern

25 River water outside Kern County. The Project would constitute a dramatic shift in the use of a

26 substantial quantity of water.

27

28
-22-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

97. Despite these significant, far reaching changes, the EIR presents a very limited,

2 narrow and incomplete analysis of the Project's impacts, and the EIR does not make any meaningful

3 or credible attempt to analyze or review the impact of these significant changes on the local

4 environment. The EIR only considers very limited project specific impacts, and fails to consider the

5 overall impact on the local environment, including the Kern River, flows of water in the River, the

6 local groundwater basin, and the environment in and around the River.

7 98. The entire EIR is fundamentally flawed because it fails to discuss, recognize or

8 account for the fact that the Project will result in a decrease in water supplies for the City, and other

9 entities that use and rely on Kern River surface supplies, and banked Kern River supplies.

10 Consequently the EIR fails to properly assess or review Project impacts, including impacts on local

11 water supplies, fails to inform the public of the impacts resulting from the Project, and fails as a

12 CEQA document.

13 99. The EIR consequently fails to review and analyze the impact of the uses of the

14 potential water sources on the environment, other water users, and local water supplies. The EIR

15 fails to even come close to satisfying CEQA requirements concerning the identification and

16 discussion of the impacts of a large water supply and storage project, as articulated in Vineyard Area
17 Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Rancho Cordova, supra, and related cases.

18 100. The EIR is also deficient because to the extent it does attempt to review the impacts
19 of the Project on the environment, it dismisses or minimizes a number of potential impacts to the

20 environment without explanation and based on unsupported or unexplained conclusions. That is not

21 appropriate, as a bare conclusion without an explanation of the factual and legal basis is not a

22 sufficient analysis of an environmental impact. (Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n., supra, 47

23 Cal.3d at p. 404.)

24 The EIR Does Not Adequately Assess Project Impacts on the Local Groundwater Basin

25 101. The EIR does attempt to review and discuss the impact of the Project on the local

26 groundwater basin, and groundwater supplies, but the review is incomplete, misleading, and not in

27 compliance with CEQA. In particular, the EIR does not sufficiently identify and discuss in any

28
-23-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 detail the impact of the Project on other banking projects and programs in the area, groundwater

2 levels in the vicinity of the Project, and related impacts on the basin and local water supplies as a

3 result of the extraction of water in connection with the Project, and the transfer of water from the

4 Project out of the region.
102. The EIR only reviews very localized impacts on groundwater resources, within

6 Rosedale and the Project area, and in wells immediately adjacent to the Project site. The EIR does

7 not review longer term impacts of the Project on the groundwater basin, or review the impact of the

8 Project on groundwater levels and quantities farther removed from the Project site.

9 103. The EIR also fails to account for critically dry years, when water levels throughout

10 the basin can and have fallen substantially. The EIR also does not consider increased pumping by

11 other water banks in the area, or increased impacts on local pumping and water supplies as a result

12 of global warming conditions.

13 104. The EIR's conclusion that the Project, and the extraction of up to 50,000 acre-feet of

14 water per year for transfer out of the region, will have a "Less than Significant Impact" (DEIR, p.

15 3.10-41) on the environment is therefore not supported by any data, and also appears contrary to

16 common sense and logic.

17 105. The EIR's review of Project impacts on groundwater is also flawed and incomplete

18 because the EIR does not sufficiently describe the local groundwater basin or consider other uses of

19 and burdens on the basin. The EIR, for example, does not identify or discuss the entities, besides

20 Rosedale, that pump water from the basin, describe the quantities and timing of groundwater

21 extractions from the basin, or discuss the impacts of the pumping of other parties on the basin In

22 connection with the Project.

23 106. The EIR also does not assess the actual impact of increased groundwater banking and

24 pumping in the area by other entities. The EIR only provides very general, vague statements and
25 information about the groundwater basin, other spreading projects, and the extraction of water from

26 the basin. The EIR's reliance on historical groundwater and pumping data additionally is not

27 reasonable in the present situation. In light of the recent, long-term drought, rapidly increasing

28
-24-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

pumping, and the proliferation of new banking projects and facilities, the EIR's reliance on past,

2 historical data is not helpful and does not accurately assess or disclose the impacts of the Project.

3 The EIR Does Not Adequately Assess Project Impacts on the Kern River

4 107. The EIR fails to provide sufficient analysis, explanation or discussion of the impacts

5 of the Project on the Kern River, including on flows of water in the Kern River, the environment in

6 and around the Kern River, the aquifer underlying the Kern River, and the patterns of diversion and

7 use of water from the River.

8 108. Although the EIR provides very little detail or meaningful information about the

9 Project and its components, the EIR still reveals that the Project will utilize substantial quantities of

10 Kern River water. The EIR, however, fails to properly identify or discuss the Kern River supplies
11 that will be utilized in the Project. The section of the EIR that reviews impacts on water resources

12 (Chapter 3.10) instead focuses only on impacts on groundwater conditions and supplies within

13 Rosedale. The EIR does not even acknowledge that the Kern River will be impacted by the Project,
14 let alone does it conduct a review to determine the significance of the Project's impact on the Kern

15 River.

16 109. The EIR therefore does not discuss or analyze the impact of the Project on the

17 quantity and timing of flows in the Kern River. The EIR does not review Project impacts on the

18 Kern River environment, including plant and animal life in and around the River. The EIR further

19 does not describe the impacts of the Project on recharge from operation of the River and
20 groundwater supplies in and around the River channel.

21 110. Rosedale does not hold any appropriative Kern River rights (nor does Irvine).
22 Rosedale's plan to utilize substantial quantities of Kern River water for a new water banking project

23 will necessarily result in changes, and impacts, in the diversion and use of water from the Kern

24 River. Even if Rosedale is only proposing to use Kern River water purchased from the City, the

25 Project would still likely result in changes in the timing, place of use, manner of use, and extent of

26 use of such water. Those changes will necessarily have an impact on the Kern River and the Kern
27 River corridor.

I 111. The EIR indicates that the parties may need project approval for "Appropriative

2 Water Rights Holders: Use or transfer of pre-1914 or post-1914 appropriative water rights," and

3 "State Water Resources Control Board: Transfer of post-1914 appropriative water rights." (DEIR, p.

4 2-20.) The EIR, however, provides no information about which water rights may be subject to those

5 approvals, which parties would transfer those rights to Rosedale, or the present use of those water

6 supplies. The failure to include that information renders the EIR inadequate, and also makes it
impossible to consider the impacts of Rosedale's use of such water supplies on the Project.

112. It was additionally important and necessary for the EIR to review Project impacts on

9 the entities that have submitted competing applications to appropriate Kern River water, including

10 Bakersfield. In fact, Rosedale's application seeks to obtain right to the same "flood water" loosely

11 defined and identified in other competing applications to appropriate. It was therefore particularly

12 important that the EIR consider Project impacts on the other entities that seek to obtain rights to the

13 same water supplies Respondents propose to use in the Project.

14 113. The EIR also fails to identify or review secondary impacts on entities that are

15 currently using Kern River water that would be used in the Project. Presumably those entities will

16 have to obtain replacement water supplies, which could produce further impacts, such as increased

17 groundwater pumping and use in the impacted districts.

18 114. The EIR specifically does not discuss or analyze the impact of the Project on the

19 quantity and timing of flows in the Kern River. The EIR does not attempt to explain or quantify

20 such flows, which consequently makes it impossible to determine the impacts of the Project on such

21 flows. The EIR also does not describe the plant and animal life in and around the River, or the

22 impact of the Project on such plant and animal life.

23 The EIR Does Not Sufficiently Assess the Impact of Transfers of Water to Orange
24 County

25 115. The EIR is also fatally flawed and defective because it fails to assess or discuss the
26 impacts of transfers of water, including valuable, high quality Kern River surface water, out of
27 Rosedale, and out of Kern County, to Irvine.
28
-26-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

I 116. Out-of-basin transfers of valuable and important local water supplies will necessarily

2 have significant impacts on the local environment, including on the Kern River, other local water

3 supplies, including groundwater supplies, and other water users. Transfers of Kern River water

4 outside the County would deprive the region of a limited, high quality source of drinking and

5 irrigation water, and negatively impact flows of water in the Kern River, and the environment in and

6 around the River. Transfers of Kern River water out of the County would also deprive the

7 groundwater basin of necessary recharge, which would negatively impact groundwater levels, the

8 quality of water in the basin, and the supply of water available for consumptive use in the County.

9 117. Despite such significant impacts, the EIR is completely devoid of any discussion of

10 the impacts of out-of-area transfers of Kern River water, or other local water supplies. Again, the

11 section of the EIR that reviews impacts on water resources, Chapter 3.10, almost exclusively focusesl

12 on localized impacts on groundwater resources in the Project area.
13 118. The EIR's failure to disclose and discuss such impacts is particularly glaring and
14 problematic in light of current drought conditions, the depleted water supplies in the region, and the
15 critically overdrafted local groundwater basin. There is also no review or discussion of replacement

16 water supplies that might be utilized to replace or make up for water lost to Southern California, and
17 no discussion of the impacts associated with the use of such alternate water sources.

18 The EIR Does Not Sufficiently Identify or Assess the Impacts of the Project on the City

19 119. The EIR does not provide any meaningful, accurate or comprehensive discussion of
20 the impacts of the Project on the City. The EIR similarly provides almost no information about
21 "baseline" conditions within the City, as well as the City's baseline water rights.

22 120. The City will apparently provide one of the primary water sources to the Project

23 through its transfer of Kern River water to Rosedale pursuant to the 1961 Agreement. The

24 boundaries of the City overlap the boundaries of Rosedale, and the Project would be located

25 immediately adjacent to the City. The operation of the Project, including the transfer of City

26 supplies for use in the Project, and the apparent significant anticipated pumping and extraction of

27

28
-27-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

l groundwater as a result of the Project, would necessarily impact the City's water supply, and the

2 City's operation of its nearby 2800 Acre recharge and water banking facility.

3 121. The failure to review the impacts of the Project on the City is in direction violation of

4 CEQA requirements. An EIR must consider all impacts of a project on the environment, even if the

5 impacts would be felt by another agency. (San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center, supra, 27

6 Cal.App.4th at pp. 739-40.)

7 122. The EIR was also required to review the impacts of the Project on the City because

8 the City will provide water to Rosedale for the Project. California courts have rejected or

9 invalidated environmental review documents for failing to properly and adequately review the

10 impact of a water transfer on a local water supply or source. (See Friends of the Santa Clara River

11 V. Castaic Lake Water Agency (2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 1373 [finding an EIR for the acquisition of

12 supplemental state water pursuant to the Monterey Agreement deficient for failing to completely

13 assess the impacts of the water transfer].)

14 The EIR Does Not Adequately Consider Impacts of the Project on Other Resources,
15 Features and Conditions

16 123. In addition to the above deficiencies, the EIR fails to properly identify and consider

17 Project impacts on the following resources, features and conditions:

18 A. Hydrology and Water Quality. The EIR improperly assumes, and

19 concludes, without supporting data, that the Project will have a positive impact on

20 water quality. The EIR further only discusses impacts on water quality from recharge

21 and banking of surface water supplies through the Project. The EIR fails to consider

22 or review impacts on water quality associated with and arising from extraction of

23 water in connection with the Project. That is a significant omission because

24 extraction of water, with associated lowering of groundwater levels and migration of

25 water through the aquifer as a result of pumping, could have a significant adverse

26 impact on water quality in the region.

27 B. Population and Housing. Respondents claim that the Project would not

28 induce substantial unplanned population growth in an area, would not have a direct
-28-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

I growth inducement effect, and would not result in substantial permanent employment

2 that could indirectly induce population growth. (DEIR, p. 3-4.) Those claims are

3 misleading and inaccurate, as the EIR discloses that water supplies produced by the

4 Project will be used to meet Irvine's municipal and domestic water demands. (DEIR,
p. ES-7.) Water produced by the Project will therefore necessarily have an impact on

6 housing and population growth in Irvine's service area. The statement is also

7 misleading because it does not account for the loss of water supplies, including Kern

8 River water supplies, that would be transferred out of the area to Irvine, which

9 supplies would no longer be available for use by the City and other entities to satisfy
10 local population and housing needs and demands. The EIR also does not account for
11 the drinking water needs of individual residents within Rosedale's service area, and

12 the impact of the Project on that population.

13 C. Agricultural Impacts. The EIR fails to consider the impact of the Project on
14 a agriculture in Kern County based on a transfer of local water supplies to Irvine in
15 Orange County, and specifically fails to identify and review potential adverse impacts
16 associated with the loss of local water supplies used for agricultural production, and,

17 in particular, the transfer of local agricultural water supplies to Orange County for

18 municipal uses.

19 D. Air Quality Impacts. The EIR should identify and consider any air quality
20 impacts associated with extraction of water in connection with the Project, but fails to

21 do so.

22 E. Biological Resources. The EIR fails to consider or account for Project

23 impacts on biological resources in and around the Kern River, including impacts

24 associated with the transfer of Kern River water out of the region. The EIR also fails

25 to account for and discuss potential impacts on the Buena Vista Lake Shrew and the
26 City's Habitat Management Plan for the shrews in the City's 2800 Acre recharge
27 facility.

28
-29-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 F. Subsidence. The EIR fails to provide any facts or data to support the

2 conclusion that the Project "would not cause subsidence relative to existing

3 conditions " (DEIR, p. 3.7-23.) The EIR fails to consider the actual operation of the

4 Project, including extraction of significant water supplies during dry year conditions,

5 on subsidence. The EIR fails to consider or even identify baseline conditions in the

6 area, the rate of extraction for the Project, or other pumping in the vicinity of the

7 Project.

8 G. Greenhouse Gas Emissions. The EIR should, but fails to, identify and

9 consider any greenhouse gas impacts associated with extraction of water in

10 connection with the Project.

11 H. Land Use and Planning. The EIR is inadequate and incomplete for not

12 considering land use and planning impacts within the boundaries of Irvine. The

13 transfer of substantial local water supplies to Irvine would certainly have an impact

14 on land use and development within Irvine. The EIR also fails to consider impacts on
15 land use and planning in Bakersfield and Rosedale based on the loss of local water

16 supplies necessary to serve municipal needs.

17 I. Utilities and Service Systems. The EIR claims that the Project would have

18 sufficient water supplies available to serve the Project and reasonably foreseeable

19 future development during normal, dry and multiple dry years. (DEIR, p. 3.16-7.)

20 The EIR, however, fails to sufficiently or properly identify those water supplies.
21 Respondents claim, for example, that the Project would only utilize "high flow" Kern
22 River water "that would otherwise have left Kern County or created flooding
23 conditions" (DEIR, p. 3.16-7), but they also contradict that claim and state that the

24 Project would utilize "Kern River water available to the Authority through
25 agreement(s) with existing right holders." (DEIR, p. 2-1.) In addition, the EIR fails

26 to disclose that the State Water Resources Control Board ("SWRCB") has declared

27 that Kern River "flood water" that would otherwise have left the area is

28
-30-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

l unappropriated water, and Respondents cannot utilize those supplies without

2 authorization, and a license or permit, from the SWRCB.

3 J. Growth Inducement. The EIR should, but fails to, consider impacts on

4 growth within Kern County and Bakersfield as a result of a loss of valuable local

5 water supplies to Southern California

6 124. Respondents' actions in certifying the EIR and approving the Project constitute a
prejudicial abuse of discretion and a violation of CEQA because Respondents failed to proceed in a

8 manner required by law, their actions are not supported by adequate findings, and their actions and

9 findings are not supported by substantial evidence, in that the EIR is misleading, inaccurate,

10 inadequate and incomplete, and consequently does not comply with the requirements of CEQA.

11 125. In each of the respects enumerated above, Respondents violated their duties under

12 CEQA, abused their discretion, failed to proceed in a manner required by law, and decided the

13 matters complained of without the support of substantial evidence. Accordingly, the Court must set
14 aside Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

15 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION
(Writ of Mandate- -C.C.P. §§ 1085 and 1094.5) 16 (Violation of CEQA - Inadequate Discussion of Cumulative Impacts and Related Projects)
17 126. The City realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, each and every
18 allegation in paragraphs 1 through 125 of this Petition and Complaint.
19 127. An EIR must evaluate significant cumulative impacts, based on an assessment of the
20 project's incremental effects "viewed in connection with the effects of past projects, the effect of
21 other current projects, and the effects of probable future projects." (14 Cal. Code Regs. §§ 15130(a),
22 15065(c).) An adequate cumulative analysis requires a list of projects producing related or
23 cumulative impacts. (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15130(b)(1).)
24 128. The cumulative impacts analysis must assess the cumulative impacts of other projects
25 or activities that produce similar impacts in the relevant geographic area. (Kings County Farm
26 Bureau v. City of Hanford (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 692, 720-721.) The purpose of the cumulative
27 impacts analysis is to avoid considering projects in a vacuum, because failure to consider cumulative
28
-31-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 harm may risk environmental disaster. (Whitman V. Board of Supervisors (1979) 88 Cal.App.3d

2 397, 408.)

3 129. The EIR does not comply with the requirements for the review of the Project's

4 cumulative impacts on the environment. Among other problems, the cumulative impact discussion

5 fails to properly identify the Project's impacts, adverse or otherwise, fails to provide sufficient

6 details regarding other projects, and potential projects, in the region, and fails to properly identify

7 and discuss the cumulative impacts of the Project in connection with other projects. The same errors

8 and omissions in the "impact" section of the EIR are carried over and compounded in the cumulative

9 impact section of the EIR.

10 130. The EIR also fails to provide any meaningful discussion or analysis of the cumulative

11 impact of the Project on the Kern River, and other local water supplies and sources. Once again,

12 Respondents cannot provide a proper or sufficient analysis of the cumulative impacts of the Project

13 on the Kern River, and other local water supplies, because the EIR fails to provide basic, essential

14 information on baseline conditions in the Kern River, and the impacts of the Project on the Kern

15 River.

16 131. The cumulative impact discussion is also flawed and not in compliance with CEQA

17 requirements because the EIR fails to provide relevant, accurate or helpful information with regard

18 to the other projects in the region which would cause or contribute to cumulative impacts. The EIR

19 fails to provide data, information or details with regard to the water banking projects identified in the

20 EIR, including conditions or activities which would contribute to or cause cumulative impacts. The

21 EIR instead consistently summarily dismisses a number of potential cumulative impacts without

22 providing or referring to any supporting facts or data, and without providing any accurate or

23 reasonable explanation of the impacts. The EIR's analysis of cumulative impacts is therefore

24 prejudicially and unreasonably understated, and is based primarily on speculation and wishful

25 thinking.

26 132. Respondents failed to identify and consider the cumulative impacts of the Project on

27 other entities in the region that divert and use Kern River water, including the City, as well as all
28
-32-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

l other "projects" proposed or undertaken by those entities that involve the diversion and use of Kern

2 River water.

3 133. The cumulative impact section of the EIR also fails to consider cumulative impacts

4 arising out of secondary impacts triggered by the Project. As indicated previously, implementation
of the Project would necessarily increase pumping in other parts of Kern County by entities that
previously used some of the water proposed for use in the Project. The City, for example,

7 historically has used some of that water for either direct delivery to water treatment plans, or for

8 recharge and banking in its 2800 Acre recharge facility. The transfer of water to Irvine would likely

9 increase pumping, and the volume of pumping, by the City to replace those water supplies.

10 134. In addition to identifying other local water banking projects (see DEIR, p. 3.9) and
11 related cumulative impacts, the EIR should have considered cumulative impacts from groundwater

12 extractions and use in general, and not just those in connection with a water banking project. The

13 extensive use of local banked water supplies, particularly in dry years, would have a considerable

14 cumulative impact, when combined with the Project, on local water supplies.

15 135. The EIR should have also included and addressed cumulative impacts associated with

16 the projects proposed by other applicants for unappropriated water which would be used in the
17 Project. For example, the Kern Water Bank has issued an EIR for a project that would utilize the

18 same high flow water that Rosedale seeks through its application for this Project. The EIR should

19 have considered impacts from the implementation of those projects in conjunction with its proposed

20 use of the unappropriated high flow water supplies.

21 136. The EIR should have also considered the cumulative impact of other water transfers

22 and water conveyance projects in Kern County, and in particular to other Southern California

23 interests.

24 137. Respondents' actions in certifying the EIR and approving the Project constitute a

25 prejudicial abuse of discretion and a violation of CEQA because Respondents failed to proceed in a

26 manner required by law, their actions are not supported by adequate findings, and their actions and

27

28
-33-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 findings are not supported by substantial evidence, in that the EIR is misleading, inaccurate,

2 inadequate and incomplete, and consequently does not comply with the requirements of CEQA.

3 138. In each of the respects enumerated above, Respondents violated their duties under

4 CEQA, abused their discretion, failed to proceed in a manner required by law, and decided the

5 matters complained of without the support of substantial evidence. Accordingly, the Court must set

6 aside Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

7 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION
(Writ of Mandate C.C.P. $$ 1085 and 1094.5)
8 (Violation of CEQA Inadequate Discussion of Potential Areas of Controversy)
9 139. The City realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, each and every
10 allegation in paragraphs 1 through 138 of this Petition and Complaint.
11 140. An EIR must identify and summarize "[a]reas of controversy known to the Lead
12 Agency including issues raised by agencies and the public." (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15123(b)(2).)
13 141. The EIR violates that requirement by failing to identify significant areas of
14 controversy and issues of concern with regard to the Project, including the City's opposition to
15 transfers of Kern River water supplies out of the region, to Southern California. The City, in fact,
16 raised a number of concerns with the Project in its comments to the NOP and the DEIR. The EIR,
17 however, fails to acknowledge, review or analyze that opposition, and that area of controversy.
18 142. The EIR also fails to acknowledge prior disputes among the Kern River interests and
19 other local water districts, including Rosedale, which could impact Respondents' ability to
20 implement the Project or to transport water developed through the Project. Rosedale, for example,
21 has been involved in litigation with its neighboring water districts with regard to Rosedale's
22 groundwater pumping and use. Rosedale is also involved in litigation with the City with regard to
23 the City's 1961 Agreement with Rosedale (Kern County Superior Court Case No. BCV-19-103483),
24 which litigation could impact the supply of water for the Project. The EIR should have identified
25 and discussed those disputes, and considered the impact of the Project on such disputes, and the
26 issues arising from such disputes.
27 143. Even if Respondents disagree with the City's objections and complaints about the
28
-34-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Project, the environmental documentation must still summarize the main points of disagreement

2 between the City and Respondents regarding Respondents' abilities to undertake the Project. (Cal.
Code Regs. § 15151; Browning-Ferris Indus. of California, Inc. v. City Council (1986) 181

4 Cal.App.3d 852, 862.) An agency may choose among differing opinions or conclusions as long as
the EIR identifies the competing arguments correctly and in a responsive manner. (Browning-Ferris

6 Indus., supra, 181 Cal.App.3d at p. 863.)

7 144. Respondents' actions in certifying the EIR and approving the Project constitute a

8 prejudicial abuse of discretion and a violation of CEQA because Respondents failed to proceed in a

9 manner required by law, their actions are not supported by adequate findings, and their actions and
10 findings are not supported by substantial evidence, in is that the EIR is misleading, inaccurate,

11 inadequate and incomplete, and consequently does not comply with the requirements of CEQA.

12 145. In each of the respects enumerated above, Respondents violated their duties under

13 CEQA, abused their discretion, failed to proceed in a manner required by law, and decided the
14 matters complained of without the support of substantial evidence. Accordingly, the Court must set

15 aside Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

16 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION
17 (Writ of Mandate- C.C.P. §§ 1085 and 1094.5) (Violation of CEQA - Failure to Properly Consider Alternatives to the Project)
18 146. The City realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, each and every
19 allegation in paragraphs 1 through 145 of this Petition and Complaint.
20 147. An EIR must consider the full range of alternatives for meeting the goals of a
21 particular program, and inform the decision makers as to the various issues associated with those
22 alternatives. It is the policy of this state to require governmental agencies at all levels to consider
23 alternatives to proposed actions affecting the environment. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21001(g).)
24 Even if a project proponent has rejected various alternatives, an EIR must explain why each
25 suggested alternative either does not satisfy the goals of the proposed project, does not offer
26 substantial environmental advantages, or cannot be accomplished." (San Joaquin Valley
27 Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center, supra, 27 Cal.App.4th at p. 737.)
28
-35-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 148. An EIR must "describe a range of reasonable alternatives to the project, or to the

2 location of the project, which would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project but
would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project, and evaluate the

4 comparative merits of the alternatives." (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15126.6(a).) It must contain
"sufficient information about each alternative to allow meaningful evaluation, analysis, and
comparison with the proposed project." (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15126.6(d).)

7 149. The EIR does not satisfy the requirements of CEQA for consideration of alternatives.

8 The only alternatives considered in the EIR are the "no project" alternative, and the construction and

9 the use of a different water banking project, in a different location.

10 150. There IS no indication in the EIR that Respondents considered actual, practical or

11 meaningful alternatives to the Project, including alternate sources of supply. Similarly, there is no

12 indication that Respondents actually or properly considered the "no project" alternative, as required
13 by CEQA.

14 151. The EIR is deficient and flawed for not considering other viable, practical alternatives
15 available to Respondents. The EIR fails to consider other alternatives which could achieve
16 "flexibility," including use of other existing banking facilities, such as the Pioneer Project or Kern

17 Water Bank, expansion of existing Rosedale banking projects, changes in the management and

18 operation of its existing banking projects, water transfers and exchanges with local water districts

19 and purveyors, restrictions on groundwater pumping within Rosedale, and fallowing of fields.
20 152. The alternatives analysis is also deficient because the EIR fails to consider any

21 alternative to out-of-County sales of local water to Irvine. The EIR should have at least considered

22 alternatives to the Project involving local districts, instead of an Orange County urban water district.

23 Irvine should have also considered sources of supply other than local Kern River water supplies.

24 153. The description and review of the "no project" alternative is inaccurate and

25 incomplete. The EIR improperly focuses on the purported benefits of the Project without actually

26 considering impacts and benefits associated with the "no project" alternative. A proper, credible

27 review of the "no project" alternative would have considered and compared status quo conditions

28
-36-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

with the actual impacts associated with the Project, instead of only focusing on the purported
benefits of the Project.

154. Respondents' actions in certifying the EIR and approving the Project constitute a
prejudicial abuse of discretion and a violation of CEQA because Respondents failed to proceed in a

5 manner required by law, their actions are not supported by adequate findings, and their actions and

6 findings are not supported by substantial evidence, in that the EIR is misleading, inaccurate,

7 inadequate and incomplete, and consequently does not comply with the requirements of CEQA.

8 155. In each of the respects enumerated above, Respondents violated their duties under

9 CEQA, abused their discretion, failed to proceed in a manner required by law, and decided the

10 matters complained of without the support of substantial evidence. Accordingly, the Court must set

11 aside Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

12 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION
(Writ of Mandate C.C.P. 88 1085 and 1094.5) 13 (Violation of CEQA - Inadequate Response to Comments)
14 156. The City realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, each and every

15 allegation in paragraphs 1 through 155 of this Petition and Complaint.

16 157. CEQA requires agencies to evaluate comments received on a draft EIR and to prepare

17 a written response that describes the disposition of each significant environmental issue that is

18 raised. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21091(d).) The CEQA Guidelines explain that "there must be a

19 good faith, reasoned analysis in response [c]onclusory statements unsupported by factual
20 information will not suffice." (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15088(c).)

21 158. In violation of these requirements, Respondents failed to provide an adequate written

22 response to significant environmental issues raised in comments they received on the DEIR. For

23 example, Respondents failed to respond adequately to comments demonstrating that the Project will

24 result in significant adverse environmental impacts which were not addressed in the EIR.

25 Respondents also failed to respond adequately to comments demonstrating that the data and analysis

26 underlying many of the key findings and conclusions in the EIR are flawed, unsupported by
27 substantial evidence, or otherwise inadequate.

28
-37-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 159. In addition, Respondents failed to provide an adequate rationale for rejecting

2 alternatives to the Project proposed by Petitioner and other commenting agencies and persons,

3 including alternatives that did not involve transfers of local water supplies to Southern California.

4 160. By failing to provide adequate responses to public comments and proposed

5 alternatives, Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law. Moreover, Respondents'

6 finding that adequate responses to comments were provided is not supported by substantial evidence.

7 161. Respondents' actions in certifying the EIR and approving the Project constitute a

8 prejudicial abuse of discretion and a violation of CEQA because Respondents failed to proceed in a
manner required by law, their actions are not supported by adequate findings, and their findings are

10 not supported by substantial evidence, in that the EIR is misleading, inaccurate, inadequate and

11 incomplete, and consequently does not comply with the requirements of CEQA.

12 162. In each of the respects enumerated above, Respondents violated their duties under

13 CEQA, abused their discretion, failed to proceed in a manner required by law, and decided the
14 matters complained of without the support of substantial evidence. Accordingly, the Court must set

15 aside Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

16 NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION
(Declaratory Relief)
17 163. The City realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, each and every
18 allegation in paragraphs 1 through 162 of this Petition and Complaint.
19 164. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between the City, on the one hand,
20 and Respondents, on the other hand, concerning Respondents' compliance with CEQA, the CEQA
21 Guidelines and other operative provisions of California statutory, regulatory and decisional law
22 concerning Respondents' certification of the EIR, adoption of findings, and approval of the Project.
23 165. The City contends that Respondents have acted in violation of CEQA, the CEQA
24 guidelines and other operative provisions of California statutory, regulatory and decisional law, in
25 each of the respects set forth in the prior causes of action, and as supported by the administrative
26 record. The City contends that Respondents must vacate and rescind the filing of the NOD,
27 certification of the EIR, and approval of the Project by the Boards of Directors of Respondents, and
28
-38-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 undertake proper and complete environmental review of the Project, including preparation of a

2 proper and complete EIR.

3 166. The City is informed and believes that Respondents dispute these contentions.

4 167. Accordingly, a judicial resolution of this controversy and a declaration of the rights of

5 the parties herein with regard to Respondents' compliance with CEQA are necessary and appropriate

6 in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure Section 1060.

7 TENTH CAUSE OF ACTION
(Injunction) 8

9 168. The City realleges and incorporates, as though fully set forth herein, each and every

10 allegation in paragraphs 1 through 167 of this Petition and Complaint.

11 169. Unless the City is granted injunctive relief, the City and its residents will suffer
12 irreparable harm in that the implementation of the Project will cause permanent harm to the City and

13 its residents and will create adverse environmental impacts, as previously described herein, to the

14 detriment of the City and its residents.

15 170. The City has exhausted all available administrative remedies and complied with all

16 jurisdictional and procedural requirements for bringing this action and for seeking injunctive relief,

17 as described herein.

18 171. The City is therefore entitled to an injunction and order, pursuant to Code of Civil

19 Procedure Sections 526 and 527 and Public Resources Code Section 21168.9, directing Respondents

20 to reconsider or change the Project pending proper environmental review, from implementing or
21 taking any steps to implement the Project, constructing any improvements pursuant thereto, or taking

22 any steps in connection with the Project, including, but not limited to, granting or obtaining any
23 approvals, permits or entitlements, engaging in any construction of land preparation activities,

24 changing their operations and/or taking any other actions related to the Project, and to take other

25 corrective, remedial action in accordance with Public Resources Code Section 21168.9.

26 172. The City lacks an adequate remedy at law because future monetary damages cannot

27 be ascertained and the City and its residents cannot be compensated for the irreparable injury and

28
-39-
CITY OF BAKERSFIELD'S VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 future environmental harm and degradation caused by the Respondents' conduct, as alleged herein.

2 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

3 WHEREFORE, the City prays for relief as follows:

4 l. That the Court enters judgment determining that Respondents' certification of the EIR

5 and approval of the Project was illegal and is therefore null and void;

6 2. For a writ of mandate commanding and ordering Respondents to:

7 a. vacate, rescind and set aside Respondents' filing of the NOD, certification of

8 the EIR, and approval of the Project by the Boards of Directors of Respondents,

9 b. to suspend and not complete any participation in the Project and any actual or

10 further construction, planning, financing or other work related to the Project until Respondents have

11 taken action necessary to bring the Project into compliance with CEQA,

12 C. to reconsider or change the Project pending proper environmental review, to

13 take specific action to bring their determinations, findings and decisions with regard to the Project

14 into compliance with CEQA, to take corrective action to cure the deficiencies in Respondents'

15 consideration and approval of the Project, and to take other corrective, remedial action in accordance

16 with Public Resources Code Section 21168.9, and

17 d. from otherwise taking any action pursuant to the Project which will have an

18 adverse effect on the environment;

19 3. That the Court determine, declare and order as follows:

20 a. Respondents must comply with CEQA and undertake a complete and proper

21 review of the Project under CEQA, including preparation of a new EIR, and

22 b. Respondents must suspend and not complete any participation in the Project

23 and any actual or further construction, planning, financing or other work related to the Project until

24 Respondents have taken all action necessary to comply with CEQA;

25 4. For a preliminary and permanent injunction directing Respondents to cease and desist

26 and refrain from engaging in any action related to the Project until they take necessary action to

27 comply with CEQA with regard to the Project;

28
-40-
