WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 I. INTRODUCTION

2 1. Plaintiffs and Petitioners Mojave Pistachios, LLC and Paul G. Nugent and Mary E.

3 Nugent, Trustees of the Nugent Family Trust dated June 20, 2011 ("Plaintiffs") own property that

4 overlies the Indian Wells Valley Groundwater Basin (*Basin"). Plaintiffs possess vested

5 appurtenant overlying water rights to pump groundwater from the Basin for use on their land.

6 Plaintiffs rely exclusively upon groundwater from the Basin to provide water to their 1,596 acres

7 of productive pistachio trees, highest best use of water, second only to domestic use in

8 California. (Wat. Code, §106.)

2. This action arises from a series of coordinated actions by a governmental entity, 9

I'TI  NONHHOS HNAHVA LIVAH NKLLSNMONH 10 the Indian Wells Valley Groundwater Authority (*TWVGA"), that grants Plaintiffs zero

11 allocation of groundwater for its existing 1,596 net acre pistachio orchard in a wrongful attempt
ITZZ-IOIE6 VO' 1oL4 puz yaong edroedy IZOl 12 to condition Plaintiffs' continued use of groundwater upon payment of the highest annual fee on

13 the production of groundwater in California history effective on January 1, 2021-all in

14 furtherance of the IWVGA's publicly announced, illegal and unequivocal intention of
15| subordinating Plaintiffs' paramount water rights to that of government entities.

16 3. In 2014, California enacted the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act

17 ("SGMA") with the directive to bring groundwater in California under sustainable management

18 by 2040. SGMA expressly states that it did not modify water right priorities or groundwater rights

19 under common law and reserved the authority to make such determinations to the courts. (Wat.

20 Code, §§ 10720.5, 10726.8(b).) SGMA requires that a groundwater sustainability agency.

21 ("GSA") be designated for each qualifying groundwater basin in California and that a

22 groundwater sustainability plan ("GSP") be prepared to meet the 20-year sustainability objective.

23 The IWVGA's GSP violates SGMA because it fails to respond to Plaintiffs' and

24 others comments and is replete with foundational scientific and analytical errors related, for

25 example, to Basin recharge, storage, and undesirable results. These errors are compounded by

26 the IWVGA's reliance on a groundwater model, within the exclusive control of the United
States Navy ("Navy")--the groundwater user to which the IWVGA would cede the entire 27
of the Basin-and which was withheld from the public, despite numerous 28 sustainable yield

3 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 requests from Plaintiffs to access the model and most importantly, its assumptions, inputs, and

2 parameters.

3 5. Notwithstanding that SGMA prohibits GSAs from determining the inter-se

4 priorities among competing groundwater users, the IWVGA did precisely that, adopting a legally

5 and technically deficient GSP on January 16, 2020 that deliberately ignored numerous comments

6 identifying fundamental foundational scientific and legal errors, illegally prioritized certain

7 users' water rights, and failed to adequately pursue physical measures to monitor and avoid

8 "undesirable results" (measurable physical consequences defined by Water Code section

9 10721(x)) while protecting existing beneficial uses.

ITT NOTHOS XAHAVE LIVAH NIMISNMONE 10 6. Subsequently, in furtherance of its GSP, the IWVGA adopted: (a) Ordinance No.

11 02-20 imposing a $105 per acre-foot ("AF') groundwater extraction fee (the "Extraction Fee")
1021 Anacapa Street, 2nd Floor ILZ-IOIE6 VO UEQEH HIUES 12 and Ordinance No. 05-20 ("Readopted Extraction Fee"), purportedly necessary "to finance the

13 estimated costs to develop and adopt the GSP;" (b) Resolution No. 07-20 adopting a Reporting

14 Policy for all New Groundwater Extraction Wells in the Basin ("Well Reporting Policy"); (c)

15 Resolution No. 08-20 Establishing Recycled Water Program ("Recycled Water Program") and

16 an Option Agreement for the Purchase of Recycled Water from City of Ridgecrest ("Option

17 Agreement"); and (d) three actions to implement the GSP: (1) Resolution No. 06-20, adopting a

18 report on the Basin's "sustainable yield" ("Sustainable Yield Report"), reserving 100 percent of

19 the Basin's sustainable yield to the Navy-an entity with sovereign immunity and expressly not

20 subject to SGMA-or the GSP; (2) Ordinance-No. 03-20, imposing an additional $2,130 per AF

21 fee on groundwater production to be borne solely by Plaintiffs and a limited number of other

22 non-exempt water users ("Replenishment Fee"); and (3) Resolution No. 05-20, adopting a

23 "Transient Pool and Fallowing Program," granting certain agricultural producers--but not

24 Plaintiffs--a temporary water allocation. The Sustainable Yield Report, Replenishment Fee, and

25 Transient Pool and Fallowing Program are collectively referred to herein as the "Implementing

26 Actions" because the IWVGA claims they implement the GSP.

27 7. In contravention of SGMA, the GSA prioritized the use of groundwater based

28 upon its own determination of priorities, established principally on arbitrary characterizations of

4 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 the scope, priority, and application of federal reserved water rights, including its opinion that

2 Kern County, the City of Ridgecrest, and the Indian Wells Valley Water District-each agencies

3 with a representative member on the Board of Directors of the IWVGA ("IWVGA Board")--can

4 without intent, documentation, precedent, or authorization (formal or otherwise) receive a transfer

5 of a portion of the Navy's inchoate federal reserved water rights.

6 8. The GSP, Extraction Fee, Readopted Extraction Fee, Implementing Actions, Well

7 Reporting Policy, Recycled Water Program, and Option Agreement were adopted and approved

8 without compliance with applicable law, specifically without providing Plaintiffs procedural and

9 substantive due process, by denying disclosure of the potential environmental impacts of the

10 Implementing Actions and Recycled Water Program, and Option Agreement on the environment,
TT'XOTNHOS MASAVA LIVAH NIMISNMOSH 11 such as the fallowing of agricultural land as required by the California Environmental Quality Act
ILC- TOTEG VO ERqIg xooLi puz yoons edeoery IZOI 12 ("CEQA"), and the United States and California Constitutions because they are both physical and

13 regulatory takings. The actions challenged herein will cause Plaintiffs immediate and irreparable

14 injury to their property by conditioning their continued use of vested overlying groundwater E
15 rights on the payment of fees of approximately $255,600,000.00 over the 20 year period that

16 SGMA provides the IWVGA to attain sustainability.

17 9. Instead of betraying its responsibilities under SGMA and adopting a GSP and

18 Implementing Actions that determined the relative priority of Plaintiffs' vested water rights

19 without due process of law, IWVGA should have acted in accordance with SGMA and Article X,

20- Section-2 of the California Constitution, exploring physical measures to manage aquifer -

21 withdrawals to monitor and avoid "undesirable impacts," over the next 20 years rather than

22 eliminate Plaintiffs' water use by fee exaction.

23 II. PARTIES

24 10. Plaintiff and Petitioner Mojave Pistachios, LLC is a California limited liability

25. company that, together with Petitioners and Plaintiffs Paul G. Nugent and Mary E. Nugent,

26 Trustees of the Nugent Family Trust dated June 20, 2011, own or lease approximately 3,229 acres

27 of land overlying the Basin across 83 parcels, all of which overlie the Basin and thereby possess

28 paramount overlying groundwater rights. These parcels and their ownership are further described

WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 in Exhibit A, attached hereto. Plaintiffs are farmers. Plaintiffs derive their livelihood from

2 farming, including the operations overlying the Basin.

3 11. Plaintiffs actively produce groundwater from the Basin to irrigate 1,596 net acres

4 of pistachio orchards under reasonably efficient irrigation methods.

5 12. Agriculture is a permitted land use of Plaintiffs' lands and Plaintiffs commenced
cultivation and application of groundwater to beneficial use in accordance with applicable laws

7 and local ordinances and prior to the adoption of SGMA.

13. Plaintiffs, as overlying landowners, hold the paramount right to groundwater. (City
of Barstow v. Mojave Water Agency (2000) 23 Cal.4th 1224, 1240.) The overlying right is not

10
BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LL limited by past water use practices. (Wright v. Goleta Water Dist. (1985) 174 Cal.App.3d 74, 87.)

11 The California Legislature has declared that the irrigation of agriculture is one of the highest and
1LZ-TOTE6 VE *eRqng HuES out puz 7oang edeoeuy 1Z0l 12 best uses of water in the State, second only to domestic usethe use of water for human

13 consumption. (Wat. Code, § 106.)

14 14. In addition to pumping groundwater for overlying agricultural use, Plaintiff and

15 Petitioner Mojave Pistachios, LLC also has a small domestic well, which serves a farm office.

16 15. Plaintiffs use the least amount of water possible while following best farming

17 practices for pistachios. Specifically, Plaintiffs use drip hose, pressure compensating emitters,

18 water monitoring, and even use deficit irrigation, a practice whereby Plaintiffs apply less than the

19 when it does not hurt the trees' production, full water demand of the trees at key times of the year

•20 •but does save water-and have other benefits. Plaintiffs are committed to using the most modern

21 and efficient irrigation system and actively participate in the California Pistachio Research Board,

22 which supports cutting-edge research.

23 16. Plaintiffs' croppistachios-are a long-lived desert tree that is highly tolerant of

24 saline soil. Pistachios thrive in high summer heat and can survive temperatures up to 118 degrees

25 Fahrenheit. Although peak production is generally reached around 20 years, under favorable

26 conditions, pistachio trees can live and produce for centuries. Plaintiffs' pistachio orchards were

27 planted in 2012, and replanted in 2014. Therefore, Plaintiffs' orchards are expected to reach peak

28 production in approximately 10 years and Plaintiffs' trees have a potential remaining life

6 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 expectancy of over a century, if conditions are favorable.

2 17. Plaintiffs require approximately 7,000 acre-feet per year ("AFY") of water for the

3 trees on their existing planted acreage at full maturity using efficient irrigation practices.

4 18. Plaintiffs' cumulative investments in their farming operations overlying To date,

5 the Basin exceed $32 million, in furtherance of Plaintiffs' production of pistachios for

6 commercial sale.

7 19. Defendant IWVGA is a California joint powers authority formed on July 15, 2016

8 under the Joint Exercise of Powers Act (Title 1, Division 7, Chapter 5 of the California

9 Government Code) by five local agencies-the Counties of Kern, Inyo, and San Bernardino, the
ITI'NOHHOS UIVAJIVAH NIXISNMONE 10 Indian Wells Valley Water District, and the City of Ridgecrest. The IWVGA also has two

11 "associate" members-the Navy and the United States Bureau of Land Management ("BLM").
TLZ-TOIS6 VO a Barbara, soora purr pouS edeoeuy IZOI 12 The five local agency members of the IWVGA represent less than 35 percent of the water use in

13 the Basin. After its formation, Defendant IWVGA elected to become the GSA for the Basin under

14 SGMA and was required under SGMA to prepare a GSP for the Basin by January 31, 2020.

15 20. Defendant Board of Directors of the IWVGA is the governing body of the
for the decisions at issue herein. The members of the IWVGA Board 16 IWVGA and is responsible

17 include: Chairman Mick Gleason, representing Kern County; Vice-chair Scott Hayman,

18 representing the City of Ridgecrest; Director Ron Kicinski, representing the Indian Wells Valley

19 Water District; Director John Vallejo, representing Inyo County; and Director Bob Page,
20 -representing San-Bernardino County. The members of the IWVGA Board are appointed and not.

21 elected to the IWVGA Board. Despite the significant agricultural production and water use in the

22 Basin, no member of the IWVGA Board is dedicated to represent agricultural interests. The

23 members of the IWVGA Board are sued herein only in their official capacities.

24 21. Unless otherwise described, all future references herein to the IWVGA refer to the

25 IWVGA and the IWVGA Board, collectively.

6 Action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 527, 1085, 1094.5 and Public Resources

7 Code sections 21168 and 21168.5.

8 29. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Water Code section 10726.6(b) and Code

11 Option Agreement were adopted in, and impact the residents of, the County of Kern, affects real
edecery 1Z0T treet, 2nd Floor LZ-I0IE6 VD "EqPE TLES 12 property located in the County of Kern, because the IWVGA's principal office is located in the

13 County of Kern, and because all of the acts and omissions complained of took place within the

14 County of Kern. Further, venue is proper in the Metropolitan Division of this Court pursuant to

15 Kern County Local Rule 1.7.5(d) where the Petition alleges a Cause of Action for the violation of

16 CEQA.

17 IV. STANDING

18 30. Plaintiffs are beneficially interested in the subject matter of this proceeding

19 because implementation of the actions challenged herein will, as a result of the IWVGA's failure

-20 to comply-with the-law, eradicate Plaintiffs' exercise of their overlying rights to the. waters.of the

21 Basin. Plaintiffs are therefore directly injured by the IWVGA's failure to comply with the

22 requirements of SGMA and other laws and constitutional provisions in connection with the

23 preparation and adoption of the GSP, Extraction Fee, Readopted Extraction Fee, Implementing

24 Actions, Well Reporting Policy, Recycled Water Program, and Option Agreement. In particular

25 and without limitation, these actions interfere with and infringe upon the overlying water rights

26 held by Plaintiffs.

27 31. Plaintiffs also have public interest standing because this case involves public rights

28 and the enforcement of public duties. The IWVGA has mandatory duty to comply with the

9 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 procedural and substantive requirements of SGMA, CEQA, and the United States and California

2 Constitutions. If successful, this action would enforce the mandates of these laws and so benefit

3 the public interest.

4 32. Plaintiffs have no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course

5 of law. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1086.)

6 V. EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

7 33. Plaintiffs have performed all conditions precedent to filing this action and have

8 exhausted the available administrative remedies to the extent required by law. Prior to their

9 adoption, Plaintiffs, individually and through their counsel and technical consultants, presented
ITI*XDAHHOS HTHNVI LIVAH NIZISNMONA 10 detailed and specific written and oral comments objecting to the deficiencies in the GSP,

11 Extraction Fee, Readopted Extraction Fee, Implementing Actions, Well Reporting Policy,
T.ZZ-TOTE6 VO Santa Barbara, ou puz qng edweury 1701 12 Recycled Water Program, and Option Agreement. Plaintiffs' recent written comments included,

13 but are not limited to, their January 8, 2020, June 3, 2020, June 18, 2020, July 15, 2020, August

14 6, 2020, August 19, 2020, October 15, 2020, November 19, 2020, December 16, 2020 comment
letters, submitted through counsel, which are attached hereto as exhibits. 15

16 34. Plaintiffs, individually and through their technical consultant, also participated on

17 the two advisory committees of the IWVGA Board- the Policy Advisory Committee and

18 Technical Advisory Committee from November 16, 2017, when the committees were first

19 formed, until the IWVGA wrongfully, and without adequate notice, adopted Resolution No. 03-
20 20, removing Plaintiffs from both committees. In these ways and others, Plaintiffs participated_

21 whole-heartedly in the administrative process that preceded the adoption of the GSP, to the extent

22 the IWVGA's dismissive approach to those proceedings allowed for such participation. The

23 IWVGA ignored Plaintiffs' and other stakeholders' myriad requests to address the deficiencies in

-. 24 the GSP, Extraction Fee, Readopted Extraction Fee, Implementing Actions, Well Reporting

25 Policy, Recycled Water Program, and Option Agreement prior to their adoption and any further

26 such requests are futile.

27 In addition, Plaintiffs submitted recent comment letters jointly with other interested parties,
28 including, but not limited to, a letter dated January 12, 2021.

- -.-s.

10 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 35. Plaintiffs have fully exhausted all administrative remedies in that the

2 determinations by the IWVGA adopting the GSP, Extraction Fee, Readopted Extraction Fee,

3 Implementing Actions, Well Reporting Policy, Recycled Water Program, and Option Agreement

4 are final and no further administrative appeal procedures are provided by law.

5 VI. ATTORNEYS' FEES

6 36. In seeking to compel the IWVGA to lawfully discharge its mandatory public

other 7 duties, Plaintiffs are acting in their capacity as a private attorney general in the interest of and for

8 the benefit of the public pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any

9 appropriate legal theory to enforce important rights affecting the public interest, including the

10 agricultural community. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition and Complaint will
out its duties under 11 constitute a significant public benefit by requiring the IWVGA to carry
1LUZ-TOTE6 VO 'emRqIRg 100ta puz yoons edeseuy IZOl TY YOMNHOS ANANVA LIVAH NITLSNMOHH 12 SGMA, CEQA, and the United States and California Constitutions.

13 37. Further, Plaintiffs bring this action on the basis, among other things, that the

14 IWVGA's actions in approving the GSP, Extraction Fee, Readopted Extraction Fee,

15 Implementing Actions, Well Reporting Policy, Recycled Water Program, and Option Agreement

16 were and continue to be arbitrary and capricious, without basis in law or facts, and so constitute a

17 prejudicial abuse of discretion. Pursuant to Government Code section 800, Code of Civil

18 Procedure section 1021.5, and other applicable law, Plaintiffs are entitled to reasonable attorneys'

19 fees and costs for bringing this action to redress the IWVGA's arbitrary and capricious actions in

•20 connection with the IWVGA's approval of the GSP, Extraction Fee, Readopted Extraction Fee,

21 Implementing Actions, Well Reporting Policy, Recycled Water Program, and Option Agreement.

22 VII. DAMAGES ARE AN INADEQUATE REMEDY-CAUSES OF ACTION SUPPORT THE REMEDIES OF A STAY AND/OR INJUNCTION 23

24 38. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 526 and 1085, the Court may stay or

25 enjoin the operation of any administrative decision or order challenged in this proceeding.

26 39. The IWVGA has approved the GSP, Extraction Fee, Readopted Extraction Fee,

27 Implementing Actions, Well Reporting Policy, Recycled Water Program, and Option Agreement,

28 and has proceeded to implement the provisions therein notwithstanding the serious deficiencies

11 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

identified in this Petition and Complaint. Given the IWVGA's failure to comply with the

2 requirements of SGMA, CEQA, and the United States and California Constitutions in adopting

3 these actions, any action to implement the provisions therein would be undertaken in violation of

4 law and would be null and void. Plaintiffs have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law for
the irreparable harm that would result from the implementation of the GSP, Extraction Fee,

6 Readopted Extraction Fee, Implementing Actions, Well Reporting Policy, Recycled Water
Program, and Option Agreement. A stay or preliminary injunction is necessary to restrain the

8 IWVGA from taking additional actions to implement the GSP, Extraction Fee, Readopted
Extraction Fee, Implementing Actions, Well Reporting Policy, Recycled Water Program, and

10 Option Agreement until the IWVGA has fully complied with all applicable legal requirements.

11 40. In particular, and without limitation, Plaintiffs and the public generally are
wopt puz toans edeseuy 1701 ITT'MOTHHOS HAAHVA LIVAH NIMLSNMONT LTLZ-TOLEG VO RIEQIEH HURS 12 irreparably harmed by: (1) the significant uncertainty regarding the proper application of SGMA

13 within the Basin, the appropriate role and authorities of the GSA, the legitimacy of the GSP and

14 the loss of time required to prepare a GSP deemed compliant with the requirements of SGMA,

15 delay and jeopardy by the California Department of Water Resources' ("DWR's") expected

16 rejection of the GSP, forcing a re-initiation of the GSP process; (2) the impairment of Plaintiffs'

17 ability to farm, including the ability to finance its land and related businesses dependent upon the

18 cultivation of irrigated agriculture on the property; (3) the immediate curtailment of water use by

19 Plaintiffs specifically and for all other users within just years of the adoption of the GSP. rather

20 than 2040; (4) the-failure to consider and adopt Basin-wide physical measures that may result in

21 an optimization of water use in accordance with Article X, Section 2 of the 2 California

22 Constitution; and (5) the failure to disclose and consider environmental impacts attributable to the

23 fallowing of land that will be necessitated by the adoption of the Implementing Actions and other

24 environmental impacts attributable to the Recycled Water Program, and Option Agreement.

25 41, No public interest or benefit is impaired by granting of an injunction as continued

26 actions under the GSP, Extraction Fee, Readopted Extraction Fee, Implementing Actions, Well

27 Reporting Policy, Recycled Water Program, and Option Agreement are contrary to the public

28 interest in furthering the reasonable use of water, avoiding uncertainty, adhering to the legislative

12 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 direction of SGMA reserving the responsibility for determining the relative priority of

2 groundwater rights to the judiciary, and failure to evaluate and consider potential adverse impacts

3 on the environment as required by CEQA.

4 42. A stay or injunction will not harm the IWVGA because the IWVGA is required by

5 SGMA to achieve sustainability by 2040, not 2020. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and so

6 allege that a stay or injunction sufficient to allow the IWVGA to revise the GSP, Extraction Fee,

7 Readopted Extraction Fee, Implementing Actions, Well Reporting Policy, Recycled Water
Program, and Option Agreement so as to comply with SGMA and other applicable laws would 8

9 only minimally reduce groundwater storage in the Basin and that the small amount of loss of

TIZZ-10156 VO' 12 VIII. SGMA BACKGROUND

13 43. SGMA was passed by the California Legislature and signed by the Governor in

14 September 2014. SGMA's purpose is to ensure better local and regional management of

15 groundwater use, with a goal of having sustainable groundwater management in California by

16 2040 or 2042, depending on the basin in question.

17 44. A GSA, such as IWVGA, is a local agency that implements SGMA and serves as

18 the primary entity responsible for implementing sustainable groundwater management. SGMA

19 defines "sustainable groundwater management" as "the management and use of groundwater in a

20 manner that can be maintained during the planning and implementation horizon without causing

21 undesirable results." (Wat. Code, § 10721(v).)

22 45. In high and medium-priority basins, GSAs are required to develop and implement

23 a GSP. GSPs are detailed road maps for how groundwater basins will be sustainably managed.

24 SGMA requires that GSPs for groundwater basins designated as "subject to critical conditions of

25 overdraft" be prepared and submitted to the DWR by January 31, 2020. (Wat. Code, §

26 10720.7(a)(1).) In all other high- and medium-priority basins, GSPs must be submitted to DWR

27 by January 31, 2022. (Id. at § 10720.7(a)(2).)

28

13 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 46. A GSP must be designed to achieve basin sustainability and is required to include

2 measurable objectives and milestones in five-year increments to achieve basin sustainability

3 within 20 years. (Wat. Code, § 10727.2(b)(1).) The GSP shall also include, among other things, a

4 description of the physical setting and characteristics of the aquifer system underlying the basin, a

5 planning and implementation horizon, components related to the monitoring and managing of

6 groundwater levels within the basin, and monitoring protocols that will detect changes in

7 groundwater levels. (See id. at § 10727.2(a)-(g).)

8 47. DWR's SGMA regulations (Title 23 of the California Code of Regulations,

9 Division 2, Chapter 1.5, Subchapter 2) ("SGMA Regulations") require that a GSP include a water
d'TT'YOAHHOS aTaaV; BROWNSTRIN HYATT 10 budget accounting for historical, current, and projected annual inflows to and outflows from the

11 basin, together with the volume of water in the basin. The water budget is then used to calculate
ErqIeE IueS TELZ-IOIEG V. woja puz 1ong edeseay 1Z0t 12 the basin's sustainable yield, which is defined as the "maximum amount of water, calculated over

13 base period representative of long-term conditions in the basin, and including any temporary

14 surplus, that can be withdrawn annually from a groundwater supply without causing an

15 undesirable result.' (Wat. Code, § 10721(w) [emphasis added].)

16 48. A GSP must rely upon the "best available information and science" to quantify the

17 water budget and to provide an understanding of "historical and projected bydrology, water

18 demand, water supply, land use, population, climate change, sea level rise, groundwater and

19 surface water interaction, and subsurface groundwater flow." (See generally, 23 Cal. Code Regs.,

20 § 354.18.)--- .-... .-.-

21 49. After adopting the GSP, the GSA must submit the GSP to DWR, which then posts

22 the GSP on its website and establishes a period of no less than 60 days to receive public

23 comments on the GSP. (23 Cal. Code Regs., § 355.2(b)-(c).)

24 50. The GSP must be timely submitted, contain the necessary information required by

25 SGMA, cover the entire basin, and address any earlier deficiencies identified by DWR. (23 Cal.

26 Code Regs., § 355.4(a).)

27 51. If a GSP meets these conditions, DWR considers 10 factors to determine "whether

28 [the GSP] is likely to achieve the sustainability goal for the basin." (23 Cal. Code Regs., §

14 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

355.4(b).) The factors include whether the GSP: (1) has reasonable assumptions, criteria, findings
gaps; (3) uses sustainable 2 and objectives; (2) implements reasonable measures to eliminate data

actions commensurate with the level of management criteria and projects and management

4 understanding of the basin setting; (4) considers the beneficial uses and users of the groundwater

5 and other interests affected by it; (5) uses feasible projects and management actions; (6) includes

6 a reasonable assessment of overdraft conditions; (7) adversely affects an adjacent basin; (8) has

7 coordination agreements which conform with SGMA and have been adopted by all relevant

8 parties; and whether the GSA: (9) has the legal authority and financial ability to implement the

9 GSP; and (10) has adequately addressed all credible comments and concerns. (Id. at §
ITT MAHHOS NNAAVA LLVAH NKALSNMOXE 10 355.4(b)(1)-(10).)

11 52. SGMA provides two fee authorities relevant here. First, a GSA may impose fees
1TLZ-TOTE6 V: *REQIRg EILES ot paz pong edexeuy 170r 12 pursuant to Water Code section 10730(a) to fund the costs of a groundwater sustainability

13 program, including but not limited to "preparation, adoption, and amendment of a [GSP], and

14 investigations, inspections, compliance assistance, enforcement, and program administration,

15 including a prudent reserve," as well as "permit fees and fees on groundwater extraction or other

16 regulated activity." (Wat. Code, § 10730(a).)

17 53. Water Code section 10730(b) describes the process to adopt or increase fee. The

18 GSA must "[p]rior to imposing or increasing a fee, hold at least one public meeting, at which oral

19 or written presentations may be made as part of the meeting." (Wat. Code, § 10730(b)(1).) The

20 GSA must provide notice of the meeting, consistent with Government Code. section.6066, except

upon 21 that the GSA must make available to the public the data which the proposed fee is based, "at
least 20 days prior to the meeting." (Id. at 10730(b)(2)-(3).) 22

23 54. Water Code section 10730 does not permit a GSA to use a fee adopted pursuant to

24 that section to pay for any projects and management actions to implement GSP. Fees used to

25 fund projects and management actions must be adopted pursuant to the authority and procedures

26 outlined in Water Code section 10730.2.
Water Code section 10730.2 allows a GSA that adopts a GSP to 27 55. Specifically,

28 "impose fees on the extraction of groundwater from the basin to fund costs of groundwater

15 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 management, including, but not limited to, the costs of the following: (1) Administration,

2 operation, and maintenance, including a prudent reserve. (2) Acquisition of lands or other

3 property, facilities, and services. (3) Supply, production, treatment, or distribution of water.

4 (4) Other activities necessary or convenient to implement the plan." (Wat. Code, § 10730.2(a).)

5 56. Additionally, fees adopted pursuant to Water Code section 10730.2 to fund the

6 costs of groundwater management must comply with the requirements set forth in subdivisions

7 (a) and (b) of Section 6 of Article XIII D of the California Constitution. (Wat. Code, §

8 10730.2(c).)

9 57. Subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 6 of Article XIII D of the California

10 Constitution mandate that:
(a) .... An agency shall follow the procedures pursuant to this 11
J00L PUZ 78948 BEEOEUY 1Z0I I'TI NONNOS INANVY LIVAH NIALSNAONA section in imposing or increasing any fee or charge as defined
ITLZ-TOIS6 VO EIEqIA EUES pursuant to this article, including, but not limited to, the following: 12 (1) The parcels upon which a fee or charge is proposed for
13 imposition shall be identified. The amount of the fee or charge proposed to be imposed upon each parcel shall be calculated. The 14 agency shall provide written notice by mail of the proposed fee or charge to the record owner of each identified parcel upon which 15 the fee or charge is proposed for imposition, the amount of the fee
16 or charge proposed to be imposed upon each, the basis upon which the amount of the proposed fee or charge was calculated, the
17 reason for the fee or charge, together with the date, time, and location of a public hearing on the proposed fee or charge. 18 (2) The agency shall conduct a public hearing upon the proposed fee or charge not less than 45 days after mailing the notice of the 19 proposed fee or charge to the record owners of each identified
20 parcel upon which the fee or charge is proposed for imposition. At the public hearing, the agency shall consider all protests against the 21 proposed fee or charge. If written protests against the proposed fee or charge are presented by a majority of owners of the identified 22 parcels, the agency shall not impose the fee or charge.
23 (b) ... A fee or charge shall not be extended, imposed, or
24 increased by any agency unless it meets all of the following
requirements:
25 (1) Revenues derived from the fee or charge shall not exceed the funds required to provide the property related service. 26 (2) Revenues derived from the fee or charge shall not be used for
any purpose other than that for which the fee or charge was 27 imposed.
28

16 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

(3) The amount of a fee or charge imposed upon any parcel or person as an incident of property ownership shall not exceed the 2 proportional cost of the service attributable to the parcel. (4) No fee or charge may be imposed for a service unless that service is actually used by, or immediately available to, the owner
4 of the property in question. Fees or charges based on potential or future use of a service are not permitted. Standby charges, whether
5 characterized as charges or assessments, shall be classified as assessments and shall not be imposed without compliance with 6 Section 4.
(5) No fee or charge may be imposed for general governmental 7 services including, but not limited to, police, fire, ambulance or
8 library services, where the service is available to the public at large in substantially the same manner as it is to property owners.
9
Reliance by an agency on any parcel map, including, but not I'TI NONNHOS MAIAVA LIVAH NIAISNMONA 10 limited to, an assessor's parcel map, may be considered a
11 significant factor in determining whether a fee or charge is imposed as an incident of property ownership for purposes of this TILZ-IOTE6 VO 'ERqNI NUES oui puz oans eduseuy 1Z0I 12 article. In any legal action contesting the validity of a fee or charge, the burden shall be on the agency to demonstrate 13 compliance with this article.

14 (Cal. Const., Art. XIII D, Sec. 6, subd. (a)-(b).)

15 58. Particularly relevant here, the fee shall not exceed the proportional cost of the

16 service attributable to the parcel. (Cal. Const., Art. XIII D, Sec. 6, subd. (b)(3).) If an agency is to

17 charge different rates to different customer classes, it must demonstrate the differential costs of

18 providing water service to the customer classes. (City of Palmdale v. Palmdale Water District

19 (2011) 198 Cal.App.4th 926.)

20 59. SGMA provides two mechanisms to challenge fees adopted pursuant to Water

21 Code sections 10730 and 10730.2. First, a person may bring a "judicial action or proceeding to

22 attack, review, set aside, void, or annul the ordinance or resolution imposing a new, or increasing

23 an existing, fee .. . within 180 days following the adoption of the ordinance or resolution"

24 pursuant to section 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure. (Wat. Code, § 10726.6(c), (e).) Second,

25 "Any person may pay a fee .. . under protest and bring an action against the governing body in

26 the superior court to recover any money that the governing body refuses to refund. Payments

27 made and actions brought under this section shall be made and brought in the manner provided

28 for the payment of taxes under protest and actions for refund of that payment in Article 2

17 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 (commencing with Section 5140) of Chapter 5 of Part 9 of Division 1 of the Revenue and

2 Taxation Code, as applicable." (Id. § 10726.6(d).) Plaintiffs challenge the ordinances adopting the

3 Extraction Fee, Readopted Extraction Fee, and Replenishment Fee under the first mechanism-

4 i.e., by way of a writ of mandate pursuant to section 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

5 60. SGMA grants GSAs the ability to validate a GSP pursuant to Code of Civil

6 Procedure sections 860, et seq. SGMA further provides that actions taken by a GSA are subject to

7 judicial review under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. (Wat. Code, § 10726.6(e).) A court

8 reviewing an agency's action under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 must consider: (1)

9 whether the agency acted within the scope of its delegated authority; (2) whether the agency

10 ITT NONHOS XNAXVA LIVAEI NTALSNMONg employed fair procedures in reaching its decision; and (3) whether the agency action was

11 reasonable, and not arbitrary or capricious. (Cal. Hotel & Motel Assn. v. Industrial Welfare Com.
LT-TOTE6 VO 'REqg soot puz toans edrorry 1Z0T 12 (1979) 25 Cal.3d 200, 212.) In doing so, the court "must ensure that an agency has adequately

13 considered all relevant factors, and has demonstrated a rational connection between those factors,

14 the choice made, and the purposes of the enabling statute." (Ibid.)

15 61. SGMA expressly provides that it does not disturb or alter common law water

16 rights. In adopting SGMA, the Legislature declared its intent: "to preserve the security of water

17 rights in the state to the greatest extent possible consistent with the sustainable management of

18 groundwater." (Wat. Code, §10720.1(b) [emphasis added].) SGMA also prohibits a GSA from

19 making "a binding determination of the water rights of any person or entity." (Id. at 10726.8(b).)

-20 • Further, SGMA provides that: "[n]othing in this part, or in any groundwater management plan.

21 adopted pursuant to this part, determines or alters surface water rights or groundwater rights

22 under common law or any provision of law that determines or grants surface water rights." (Id. at

23 §10720.5(b).) The duty, power, and authority to determine or alter groundwater rights is reserved

24 exclusively to the courts. (Hillside Mem'l Park & Mortuary v. Golden State Water Co. (2011)

25 205 Cal.App.4th 534, 549.)

26 62. California Constitution Article X, section 2 declares "the general welfare requires

27 that the water resources of the State be put to beneficial use to the fullest extent of which they are

28 capable." Groundwater is an important water supply source for businesses, individuals, and public

18 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 agencies that overlie or extract water from the Basin. The protection, conservation and efficient

2 use of groundwater is vitally important to the bealth, safety, and welfare of the region.

3 63. One of the bundle of property rights owned by a landowner is the right to extract

4 groundwater from land overlying a basin and put it to reasonable and beneficial use. (City of

5 Barstow v. Mojave Water Agency (2000) 23 Cal.4th 1224, 1240.)

1 65. The Basin is approximately 597 square miles (382,000 acres) in area.

2 66. Although most of the Basin is located in Kern County, portions of the Basin also

3 extend into Inyo and San Bernardino Counties (see Figure 1).

4 67. The Basin is defined by DWR Bulletin 118 as Basin No. 06-054.

5 68. In its June 2014 CASGEM Basin Prioritization Process, DWR designated the

6 Basin as medium-priority, based on a ranking score of 14.8 priority points.

7 69. Despite this initial, relatively low priority score, in its 2016 Bulletin 118 Interim

8 Update, DWR designated the Basin as "subject to critical conditions of overdraft."

9 70. Subsequently, in DWR's 2019 SGMA Basin Prioritization, the Basin was re-

10 prioritized from medium- to high-priority.

11 71. Based on the Basin designation as "subject to critical conditions of overdraft,"
yoou poz ong edeseury IZor ITI NOHAHOS HIAHVI LIVAH NITISNMONH 11ZZ-T0IE6 VD 12 SGMA required the IWVGA to prepare and submit a GSP to DWR by January 31, 2020.

13 72. Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that groundwater pumping in the Basin

14 began in the late 1800s for agricultural and domestic (i.e., single home, private wells) purposes,

15 and increased in the early 1900s as agriculture in Indian Wells Valley and mineral recovery

16 operations in Searles Valley expanded. Plaintiffs further allege, on information and belief, that

17 only after 1943, with construction of the Navy's Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake

18 ("NAWS") and development of the City of Ridgecrest did military and municipal use begin.

19 Plaintiffs allege, on information and believe, that prior to 1943, groundwater production was in

20 the range-of a few thousand-AFY,

21 73. Plaintiffs allege, on information and believe, that groundwater production from the

22 Basin has ranged primarily between about 20,000 AFY to approximately 28,000 AFY over the

23 past 40 years, with peaks in the early to mid-1980s. According to pumping data collected by the

24 Indian Wells Valley Water District, as of 2016, approximately 28,500 AFY of groundwater was

25 pumped from the Basin.

26 74. Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that the Indian Wells Valley is a

27 geologic basin that has been infilled with up to 6,500-feet of unconsolidated sediments, which

28 contain groundwater under perched, unconfined to semi-confined, and confined conditions. The

I total groundwater contained within these sediments is referred to as groundwater storage or

2 groundwater-in-storage. This groundwater storage has accumulated over thousands to tens of

3 thousands of years and represents a "groundwater savings account." The rate of annual recharge

4 (input) to this storage can be viewed as the annual "water income" to the Basin; whereas, the

5 pumping of groundwater from the Basin (output) can be viewed as the annual "water expenses."

6 Groundwater storage within the Basin can be drawn upon to meet current needs, so long as this

7 loss of storage is considered reasonable under the facts and circumstances of the case. Failing to

8 put groundwater that is presently within storage to reasonable beneficial use for the benefit of

9 people, industry and the general economy of the region is unreasonable and wasteful if the
BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 10 resulting change in storage will not cause significant and unreasonable adverse impacts

11 (undesirable results).
LILZ-TOIE6 VO 'RIEQIEg NUES 100LY puz *aang edmoeuy 1ZOt 12 75. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that total groundwater

13 in storage (all depths and all quality) is between 67 and 94 million AF. Plaintiffs allege, on

14 information and belief, that the estimated total quantity of currently usable groundwater (<1,000

15 ppm total dissolved solids (*TDS")) in storage in the first 200 feet of saturated sediments in the

of 16 Basin is between seven to nine million AF of fresh groundwater (i.e., 250 to 320 years

17 groundwater supply at 2016 pumping rates). Beyond the currently usable groundwater, as defined

18 above, deeper groundwater and groundwater of poorer quality could be put to beneficial use

19 within the Basin, increasing the volume of groundwater available for use and extending the

1a110 20 timeframe for-that-use further.

21 76. Prior to the GSP, several investigations into the quantity of recharge to the Basin

22 have been undertaken over the years. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that basis allege,

23 that studies undertaken by various researchers over the past 100 years estimate a range of

24 recharge from a low of 5,976 AFY to as high as 39,000 AFY (DRI, 2016; USGS, 2018).

17 78. The California Supreme Court has declared that "safe yield" is the maximum

18 amount of groundwater that can be withdrawn from a groundwater basin without causing

19 undesirable results, after the withdrawal of any temporary surplus. (City of Los Angeles v. City of

20 San Fernando (1975) 14 Cal.3d-199, disapproved in part on unrelated grounds in City of Barstow

21 V. Mojave Water Agency (2000) 23 Cal.4th 1224, 1247.) The California Legislature similarly

22 defined "sustainable yield" under SGMA as "the maximum quantity of water, calculated over a

23 .base period representative of long-term conditions in the basin and including any temporary

24 surplus, that can be withdrawn annually from a groundwater supply without causing undesirable

25 results." (Wat. Code, § 10721(w).) §

27 Sustainable Yield have the same general meaning.

80. SGMA defines undesirable results to include the following: 1

2 (1) Chronic lowering of groundwater levels indicating a significant and unreasonable depletion of supply if continued over the planning 3 and implementation horizon. Overdraft during a period of drought is not sufficient to establish a chronic lowering of groundwater 4 levels if extractions and groundwater recharge are managed as
5 necessary to ensure that reductions in groundwater levels or storage during a period of drought are offset by increases in groundwater 6 levels or storage during other periods. (2) Significant and unreasonable reduction of groundwater storage. 7 (3) Significant and unreasonable seawater intrusion.

81. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that no undesirable 13
BIEqEgU 14 results have been identified that are attributable to the historical groundwater production in the

15 Basin.

82. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that continuing 16

17 groundwater pumping at current rates for the foreseeable future will not cause significant and

18 unreasonable loss of storage in the Basin. In addition, Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief,

19 that no other undesirable results would occur in the Basin from continued groundwater pumping

20 at current rates for a period of 20 years or considerably more.

21 83. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that even without any

22 new supplies being made available to the Basin, groundwater production at current rates could

23 continue unabated for minimum of 20 years and cause a reduction in storage of approximately

24 500,000 AF, with corresponding reduction in groundwater levels by approximately 25 feet in

25 the center of the Basin, distant from Plaintiffs' properties. Plaintiffs allege, on information and

26 belief, this continued withdrawal would cause an additional approximately 6 percent depletion of

27 currently usable groundwater storage. That is, the Basin would still contain 94 percent of the

28 currently usable groundwater storage (and 99 percent of total groundwater storage) in the Basin.

3 that existed in 2015 is safe, sustainable and consistent with the mandate of California Constitution

4 Article X, section 2 to maximize the beneficial use of water under reasonable means provided

6 B. Formation of the IWVGA, GSA Designation, and Plaintiffs' Attempts to
Become Involved in Basin Governance
7

8 85. Plaintiffs hold a vested interest in achieving long-term Basin sustainability because

9 their farming operations depend on the continued availability of groundwater and the health of the
d'TT'NOINHOS YIANVA LIVAH NIALSNMOXS 10 Basin. Accordingly, Plaintiffs participated earnestly and cooperatively through the entire GSA

11 formation and GSP adoption process.
ITLZ-IOIS6 VO 'RIEQIRE 1old puz qo0ns edeoeuy 120T 12 86. Before the IWVGA was formed, Plaintiffs actively participated in the Indian Wells

13 Valley Cooperative Groundwater Management Group, a long-standing local data-sharing group

14 comprised of the major groundwater producers and government agencies in the Indian Wells

15 Valley. This group contributed much of the historical groundwater production information and

16 stream flow data to the IWVGA.

17 87. In 2015, after the passage of SGMA and prior to the formation of the IWVGA,

18 Plaintiffs formed the Mojave Mutual Water Company and sought membership on the GSA for the

19 Basin through a joint powers authority or other agreement as allowed pursuant to Water Code

20 section 10723.6(b). Plaintiffs' request to participate-as-a member of GSA was denied by the

21 agencies that now comprise the IWVGA.

22 88. On July 15, 2016, the IWVGA was formed as a California joint powers authority

23 pursuant to the Joint Exercise of Powers Agreement dated July 16, 2016, by and between the City

24 of Ridgecrest, County of Inyo, County of Kern, County of San Bernardino and the Indian Wells

25 Valley Water District ("JPA Agreement").

26 89. Membership was limited to only five local agency members--the Counties of

27 Kern, Inyo, and San Bernardino, the Indian Wells Valley Water District, and the City of

28 Ridgecrest. The IWVGA also has two "associate" members the Navy and the BLM. Both

24 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

associate members enjoy federal sovereign immunity from regulation under the GSP and are not

2 bound in any way by its provisions. The five local agency members of the IWVGA represent less
than 35 percent of the water use in the Basin and no member of the IWVGA Board is dedicated to

4 represent agricultural interests.

5 90. The IWVGA Board adopted Resolution No. 02-16 on December 8, 2016 to

6 establish the IWVGA as the exclusive GSA for the entirety of the Basin.

7 91. After the IWVGA denied Plaintiffs' attempt to participate in the Basin governance

8 process through obtaining membership on the IWVGA Board, certain of the now-members of the

9 IWVGA promised to develop a committee modeled after the Kern County Planning Commission
BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 10 as a means to put policy decisions in the hands of independent policy and technical committees.

11 This was not implemented.
ITLZ-IOIE6 VO UEQEA NUES oLa pur teang edeeuy 1Z0I 12 92. Instead, the IWVGA Board formed an eleven-person, voting-member Policy

13 Advisory Committee ("PAC") to advise the Board on policy-related matters and to develop non-

14 binding proposals on policy matters pertaining to the GSP. The IWVGA Board also established a

15 Technical Advisory Committee ("TAC") for the stated purpose of giving interested parties an

16 opportunity to review and conduct a thorough evaluation of each technical element of the GSP

17 prior to its finalization by Stetson Engineers Inc., the IWVGA's Water Resources Manager.

18 Instead of playing a meaningful advisory role, the PAC and the TAC became afterthoughts,

19 serving as tokens with little input into the IWVGA Board's decisions.

20 93.- The failure to give agricultural producers a seat at the table, or at least elect

21 IWVGA Board members through: popular vote, was prejudicial to Plaintiffs. For example, the

22 Kern County representative on the IWVGA Board, Supervisor Mick Gleason, a former Navy

23 Captain and Commanding Officer of NAWS, publicly stated that his "job" was to protect the

24 Navy and that he believed agriculture has no future in the Indian Wells Valley, including as

25 published in the following sources:

26 "The satisfaction I will get from [finalizing the GSP] will be significant because

27 we give it to the Navy and say "you have no worries, we don't have a threat to our

28 base because we have a sustainment plan."* ("Gleason reflects on time in office,

3 "We need to preserve the Navy's mission in the Indian Wells Valley. And that has

4 implications that dwarf other decisions.... Now the strategy is emphatically

5 and clearly and empirically that our job is to preserve the Navy base and to

6 preserve the Navy mission because it is being encroached upon. Before, when

7 we did not have that clear articulation of encroachment, we thought it was

8 [encroachment] but we weren't sure. The Navy had to take a position. Now

9 they are taking a position. That means that now from my perspective that I

18 94. Other members of the IWVGA Board also indicated that the Navy's desires were

19 paramount. Director Ron Kicinski, representing the Indian Wells Valley Water District, for

20 example, acknowledged that the Navy was in the "driver's seat" of the GSP development process:

21 When the Navy came out formally and said that they are considering groundwater an encroachment issue that is something 22 we've got to solve, otherwise they are going to say it's encroachment on the mission of the base. And them being the major 23 economic driver of the area, that means a lot ... they are the major economic driver and they are in the driver's seat. When they say 24 encroachment., it means a lot to what we are going to do, how we are going to do it and how fast we need to do it. The point is we 25 can't fail. ("Navy to GA: Groundwater 'No. 1 encroachment

26 issue,' The Ridgecrest Daily Independent (February 22, 2019).)

28 water for irrigation of agriculture one of this highest beneficial uses in the state, IWVGA Special

26 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR

21886725.5

1 Counsel summarized discussions regarding "deprioritiz[ing]" water use for agricultural

2 production, determining that water use for agriculture "should not be considered a reasonable use

3 of water," and that the "priority goal" should be "serving Navy employees:"

4 There were proposed bases which have been presented [to the IWVGA Authority board for consideration] which would
5 deprioritize agricultural production, including the purported priority of "Health and Safety" water, which presumably would 6 include some amount of gallons per person per day which the District could serve with a first priority, the statutory priority of 7 municipal and industrial water over agricultural water and the
8 assertion that agricultural use of water in the Basin under present circumstances should not be considered a reasonable a
9 use of water. . . The City of Ridgecrest has become established to perform the core role of facilitating the Navy Mission at the China I'TI 'NOTIHOS MMIAVA LIVAH NIMISNMOS 10 Lake base, so that preserving a water priority for the District

Those concepts might be

15 would be very likely to be terminated by application of those principles relatively quickly, be bought out or be ramped down
16 over an agreed period of time." (Memorandum from IWVGA Board Special Counsel James L. Markman to David Janiec re 17 "Report from March 8 and March 29, 2019 Meetings on IWVGWA Allocation Plan" (April 1, 2019) [Emphasis added].) 18

19 96. Although Plaintiffs' efforts to have a seat on the GSA were rebuffed, Plaintiffs

20 continued to pursue a positive working relationship with all stakeholders in the Indian -Wells..--
21 Valley. Early in the process, Plaintiffs earnestly pursued conversations with the Kern County
22 Board of Supervisors and the Indian Wells Valley Water District in attempts to find cooperative

23 and collaborative agreement on how to implement SGMA in the Indian Wells Valley. Even after,

24 from Plaintiffs' perspective, IWVGA decision-makers failed to reciprocate or make any effort in
25 good faith to engage in meaningful dialogue, Plaintiffs actively participated in the PAC until

26 April 2020 as a representative for large agriculture, providing constructive input, through
27 voluntary data sharing, and serving as a member of several subcommittees.
28 97. In addition, Plaintiffs provided over $100,000 in funds to support the Indian Wells

Valley Brackish Water Study Group, which is evaluating the use of brackish groundwater

2 resources to supplement shallow, fresh, groundwater supplies. Plaintiffs have also funded

3 scientific studies, the purchase of monitoring equipment, and payment of other costs incurred by

4 the TAC or PAC. Additionally, Plaintiffs, with their technical consultants, worked collaboratively

5 with local groundwater producers to develop a white paper, supported by parties that represent

6 over 80 percent of groundwater production in the Basin (including the Indian Wells Valley Water

7 District), on groundwater management in the Basin under SGMA. The paper presented an

8 approach to achieve sustainability and compliance with SGMA along with long-term viability for

9 the local community and economy.

10 C. The IWVGA's Decision-Making Process in Removing Plaintiffs from the

EIBqIE & zAES TTZZ-IOIS6 V 100L1 puz yeans edeszuy IZOl 12 98. Until April 2020, Plaintiffs, individually and through their technical consultants,

13 were active members of the TAC, representing "large agriculture." Plaintiffs, individually and

14 through their technical consultants, provided extensive comments and suggestions on

15 groundwater technical issues, including technical memoranda, sustainability criteria, and

16 management goals and objectives. In addition to participating in the subcommittees of the

17 IWVGA, Plaintiffs, with their technical consultants, provided ongoing technical support and

18 significant financial funding to the Indian Wells Valley Brackish Groundwater Feasibility

19 Program.

20 99. On April 16, 2020, however, the IWVGA Board summarily, and without notice,

21 removed Plaintiffs and their technical consultants from the membership of the PAC and the TAC

22 through adoption of Resolution No. 03-20.

23 100. The April 16, 2020 IWVGA Staff Report states that the Board's rationale for its

24 action was Plaintiffs' "failure to pay the Groundwater Extraction Fee set forth in Ordinance 02-

25 18" in late 2019 and early 2020. Yet, as acknowledged in the Staff Report, Plaintiffs had already

26 agreed to make payment of all past and currently fees due fees totaling $26,613.84. Plaintiffs

27 allege, therefore, on information and belief, that the IWVGA's action was purely punitive, given

28 that the agency had already received assurances that Plaintiffs would rectify the payment error.

15 discrimination against agriculture and opposed the requirements, set forth in the GSP and

16 Implementing Actions, that agriculture bear almost the entire responsibility for the curtailment in

17 pumping required to implement the GSP.

18 D. The IWVGA Failed to Proceed in the Manner Required by Law in Preparing and Adopting the GSP on January 16, 2020. 19

20 104. The IWVGA released a public review draft of the GSP in December 2019.

21 105. On January 8, 2020, Plaintiffs, through their counsel, submitted to the IWVGA a

22 detailed letter providing extensive comments on the December 2019 public review draft of the
copy of Plaintiffs' comment letter is attached hereto as Exhibit B, and 23 GSP. A true and correct

24 incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein.

25 106. Numerous other stakeholders also submitted comment letters on the December

26 2019 GSP draft. These letters include the January 8, 2020 comment letters submitted by

27 Meadowbrook Dairy through their attorneys and technical consultant. Plaintiffs allege, on

28 information and belief, that true and correct copies of Meadowbrook Dairy's two January 8, 2020

comment letters are attached hereto respectively as Exhibits C and D. These comments are

2 incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein.

3 107. After: public hearing, on January 16, 2020, the IWVGA adopted the GSP through

4 Resolution No. 01-20. Although the comment letters on the December 2019 public review draft

5 of the GSP identified numerous deficiencies and gaps in the document, the final GSP is not

6 significantly different from the December 2019 public review draft. Therefore, Plaintiffs, through

7 their counsel, and other stakeholders submitted additional comment letters to DWR in June 2020,

8 urging that DWR hold the IWVGA accountable to rectify the numerous deficiencies in the GSP.

9 A true and correct copy of Plaintiffs' letter to DWR is attached hereto as Exhibit E, and

13 are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein.

14 108. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that the GSP was rushed to

15 completion and is replete with foundational scientific and analytical errors. The GSP must be

16 invalidated, including for the reasons set forth below.

17 i. The GSP is Flawed because its Primary Objectiveto Protect the Navy- was predetermined 18

19 109. Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that IWVGA decision-makers had

20 already determined, prior to the adoption of the GSP, that the primary goal in managing the Basin

21 should be the protection of the Navy, and that water use by agricultural pumpers should be

22 eradicated.

23 110. Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that this bias towards the Navy and

24 against agriculture can be seen in many public statements by IWVGA decision-makers and staff

25 prior to adoption of the GSP. These statements include, but are not limited to, the statements of

26 IWVGA Board members and counsel set forth herein.

27 111. Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that the core elements of the GSP are

28 based on the IWVGA's primary objective-to reserve the Basin's entire native supply to the

30 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT
21886725.5

1 Navy---when the Navy does not pump a quantity of groundwater equal to or greater than the

2 annual recharge rate--to assign the alleged unused reserved right to other GSA member entities

3 and force all other Basin users to immediately cease pumping or pay for imported water and

4 infrastructure and related projects.

5 112. Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that the primary objective of the

6 GSP-protection of the Navy-expressly conflicts with the stated legislative purpose of SGMA

7 to "provide for the sustainable management of groundwater basins." (Wat. Code, § 10720.1(a).)

8 113. This approach lacks support in the law and the facts because, for example, the GSP

9 fails to evaluate the actual impacts of pumping by specific users in specific areas of the Basin
contributes to undesirable results. Plaintiffs allege, on I'TT'NOAROS HHANVA LIVAH NIAISNMONA 10 including whether said pumping causing or

13 Navy production wells, whereas water levels at properties owned by other pumpers are already

14 operating at the GSP's measurable objective.

15 ii. The GSP Fails to Incorporate and Respond to Stakeholder Comments

16
114. Prior to the IWVGA's adoption of the GSP, Plaintiffs, individually and through
17 their counsel and technical consultants, and other interested parties submitted extensive written
18 and oral comments on draft versions of the GSP. Regardless of their legal and technical merit, the
19 IWVGA ignored the vast majority of these comments without substantively addressing these 20 comments in a response to comments or taking any other corrective action in violation of SGMA 21
and related requirements.
22
115. SGMA requires GSAs to "consider the interests of all beneficial uses and users of
23 groundwater," such as "[a]gricultural users, including farmers" like Plaintiffs. (Wat. Code, § 24 10723.2.) Moreover, SGMA commands that GSAs "shall encourage the active involvement of 25 diverse social, cultural, and economic elements of the population within the groundwater basin
26 prior to and during the development and implementation of the groundwater sustainability plan." 27 (Id. at § 10727.8(a); see also 23 Cal. Code Regs., § 354.10.) Under the SGMA Regulations,

3 Code Regs., §§ 355.2(e)(3), 355.4(b)(4), (10).)

4 116. Likewise, the IWVGA's Communication and Engagement Plan sets forth

5 objectives including "making use of local knowledge, creating improved outcomes, building trust,

6 reducing conflict, increasing credibility, building partnerships, promoting stakeholder buy-in and

7 broader public awareness, understanding, knowledge, and support for all voices and

8 perspectives;" "includes the promise that the public's contribution will influence the decision;"

9 and promotes "communicat[ion] to all how their input affected the decision." (GSP Appendix 1-E

10 at 8-9.)

11 117. The IWVGA violated these authorities in failing to respond to comments on the
a0L1 puz yoans edeseuy IZOT ITNOTHHOS AIAVA LIVAH NILSNMONg LZ-10186 VD ERQIg TUES 12 GSP raised by Plaintiffs and other stakeholders. For example, in response to all comments in

13 seven entire sections of Mojave's January 8, 2020 comment letter on the GSP, the IWVGA

14 responded: "Comment related to legal positions and not specifically relevant to the GSP." (GSP

15 Appendix 1-F [GSP Comment and Responses Matrix] at 43-44.) The IWVGA asserted this

16 response, for example, to Plaintiffs' comments that agricultural water users should be included in

17 the permanent allocation system and that all users-not just agricultural producers-should share

18 proportionately in the shortage to avoid prioritizing access to water in a manner that infringes on
to subsidize another class of users. (Id.) 19 the water rights of one class of water users

20 118. Likewise, in response to each of Plaintiffs' comments-regarding the technical

21 inadequacies in the GSP, the IWVGA responded cursorily: "The best available information was

22 used at the time the analyses for the GSP were conducted." (GSP Appendix 1-F at 44.)

23 119. IWVGA's remaining responses to Plaintiffs' comments were: "Comment noted"

24 (applicable to every comment in four sections of Plaintiffs' comment letter), "The best available

25 information was used at the time the analyses for the GSP were conducted" (applicable to every

26 comment in four sections of Plaintiffs' comment letter), and "Comment addressed in Section

27 5.2.1.5" (applicable to one section of Plaintiffs' comment letter). (GSP Appendix 1-F at 43-44.)

28 For example, in response to Plaintiffs' comments that the GSP should more clearly explain how

32 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

the allocation system would work, how the federal government would be treated under the

2 allocation system, and why the "Transient Pool Allocation" given to agricultural users would not

3 be transferrable, the IWVGA cursorily "noted" the comments without any attempt to further

4 clarify the GSP or address Plaintiffs' concerns in single response to comments. (Id.)

5 120. Then, at the IWVGA's January 16, 2020 hearing on the GSP, IWVGA legal

6 counsel made the following "legal statement" pertaining to various comments, including those

7 submitted by Plaintiffs, that the IWVGA characterized as "legal" in nature:

8 The Water Resources Manager has referred to legal counsel legal comments received in connection with public comment to the GSP.
9 We have advised the JPA as follows.

d'TT XXHHOS NM8AVA LIVAH NIAISNMOHG 10 The GSP is a technical document that describes the physical
conditions of the basin and sets out the process for managing 11 adverse impacts. It is not intended as a determination of water TILT-TOIE6 VO 'RIBQIEE HUES 100t1 puz 10ang edaseuy IZOI 12 rights of pumpers in the Basin. It is also not legal brief. We have advised the JPA that water used or contemplated to be
13 used by the Federal Government in connection with the operation
of China Lake Naval Weapons Test Center is beyond the 14 jurisdiction of the JPA's regulatory authority. Under the process
15 outlined by the GSP, the JPA will make a technical determination of the potential scope of this water use. The remaining water, if any,
16 will be available for all water users. The JPA will then set the fees
necessary to replenish the water used beyond the safe yield by all 17 users except the Navy.
18 The legal comments we have reviewed are beyond the scope of this
19 portion of the GSP process. Many of these comments present an analysis of the JPA's statutory authority or the interaction between
20 state and federal law. Others legal issues concern objections to
actions that the JPA has yet to take. Finally, several comments are 21 based on the false presumption that the JPA is making a
determination regarding water rights. 22

23 Each of these legal comments is beyond the scope of the GSP currently before the JPA board. While the JPA has no desire to
24 curtail responses to the GSP, we have advised that responding to these legal arguments is not productive to the current GSP adoption. 25 (January 16, 2020 TWVGA "Legal Statement.")
26 121. Section 355.4(b)(4) and (10) of DWR's SGMA Regulations require that the GSP

27 determine whether the beneficial uses of groundwater in the basin and the affected land use and

28 property interests have been considered and whether there has been a response to credible

33 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 technical and policy issues raised by stakeholders. (23 Cal. Code Regs., § 355.4(b)(4), (10).)

2 Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that the identification of beneficial use, land use

3 designations, and the character of property interests all involve a mix of legal, policy and

4 technical disciplines. Therefore, the IWVGA wrongly evaded its obligations under SGMA to

5 respond to public comments by labeling certain comments as "legal" in nature.

6 122. The IWVGA also acted contrary to its own Communication and Engagement Plan

comments. 7 (GSP Appendix 1-E) in failing to respond to Plaintiffs' and others'

8 iii. The IWVGA Failed to Provide Meaningful and Transparent Opportunities for Stakeholder Engagement 9

10 123. Under SGMA, the IWVGA was required to consider the interests of all beneficial I'TT'YOTHOS ANTHVA LIVXH NIZISNMONA 11 uses and users of groundwater in the GSP development process, including interests of Plaintiffs,
11/Z-IOTE6 VE aoott pur "wans edexuy Izol 12 among other overlying groundwater rights holders with vested property rights. (Wat. Code, §

13 10723.2.) SGMA recognizes that the expertise of stakeholders, including overlying owners, is

14 critical in ensuring that GSAs use the best available information and science throughout the GSP

15 development process.

16 124. Likewise, the JPA Agreement and the IWVGA's bylaws require the IWVGA to

17 consider the interests of all beneficial uses and users of groundwater in the Basin,

18 125. The IWVGA's process for public engagement and involvement, however, was

19 lacking in several respects. First, Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that

20 the IWVGA developed modeling scenarios in closed session meetings in violation of SGMA's

21 requirements to involve beneficial users of groundwater. Plaintiffs further are informed and

22 believe, and on that basis allege, that the groundwater model was developed prior to the formation

23 of the TAC and the modeling scenarios were developed without direct and meaningful input from

24 the TAC. Although summary information regarding various modeling scenarios was presented at

25 meetings of the IWVGA Board, the underlying assumptions were insufficiently documented and

26 explained to the public. Likewise, the IWVGA failed to clearly articulate how the modeling

27 scenarios would inform the GSP and management actions to be taken thereunder. These issues

28 frustrated meaningful public participation in the GSP development process, contrary to SGMA,

34 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 and denied stakeholders due process.

2 126. For example, in its January 8, 2020 comments on the GSP, Plaintiffs renewed prior

3 requests that the assumptions for each modeling scenario under consideration be detailed and

4 promptly provided to the public along with a clear explanation of how the IWVGA incorporated

5 the modeling scenarios into the GSP and implementation of GSP Management Action No. 1.

6 Again, the IWVGA concluded that no response to this comment-or any of the comments in this

7 section of the comment letter-was warranted on the basis that it was "related to legal positions

8 and not specifically relevant to the GSP." (GSP Appendix 1-F at 43.) The IWVGA's position fails

9 to comply with SGMA, which grants the public a right to understand the factual and technical
d'TI*MJAHHOS HMAHVA LIVAH NIMISNMONI 10 underpinnings of the GSP. (See, e.g., 23 Cal. Code Regs., § 355.4(b)(1) [asking "[w]hether the

11 assumptions, criteria, findings, and objectives, including the sustainability goal, undesirable
ILLZ-TOIEG VO wRqng JOOL pOZ 1707; ViDHy TIOY 12 results, minimum thresholds, measurable objectives, and interim milestones are reasonable and

13 supported by the best available information and best available science."].) The IWVGA also

14 failed to comply with SGMA when it shrugged off comments requesting such information as "not

15 specifically relevant to the [GSP]."

16 127. Further, Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that basis allege that the

17 IWVGA does not own or control the model, authored by the Desert Resources Institute ('DRI')

18 that provides the technical foundation for the GSP. Plaintiffs allege on information and belief

19 that, instead, the model is owned and controlled by the Navy--the groundwater user to which the

20 IWVGA later reserved the Basin's entire sustainable yield even though they were not using it-

21 and the Navy's permission is necessary to modify any model parameter. The Navy model has not

22 been peer reviewed, and despite Plaintiffs' requests, the IWVGA refused to release the model to

23 stakeholders.

24 128. In Plaintiffs' January 8, 2020 comments on the GSP, Plaintiffs renewed their prior

25 requests that the Navy model be made available to Plaintiffs and other stakeholders. The IWVGA

26 failed to respond to this request, instead characterizing all comments in the relevant section as

27 "related to legal positions and not specifically relevant to the GSP." (GSP Appendix 1-F at 43.)

28 The IWVGA's position that a public request for disclosure of a model is a "legal position" is

35 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

unsupported by SGMA. (See, e.g., 23 Cal. Code Regs., §§ 352.4(f) [setting forth the standards for

2 groundwater and surface water models used for a GSP], 355.4(b)(10) [asking whether the GSP
adequately responded to comments that raise "technical or policy issues with the Plan"].)

4 129. Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that the IWVGA's development of

5 modeling scenarios, particularly Scenario 6.2, also was deficient because the IWVGA's pumping

6 allocation objectives were determined internally by IWVGA staff, fed into the model developed

7 by the Navy's contractor, and cemented into the fabric of the GSP without public comment and

8 before the sustainable management criteria were even considered.

9 130. Additionally, public review and participation was stunted because the Public

10

11 little time for the IWVGA to consider and incorporate public comments.
wDoL puz 70015 edeoeuy 120I d'TI NOTHOS HIEHVA LIVAH NIALSNMONI Review Draft of the GSP was not available for public review until December 11, 2019, leaving

TELZ-TOIE6 VO LIEqIA TUES 12 131. Furthermore, between December 11 and 27, 2019, different versions of the GSP

13 sections were made available on the IWVGA's website, making it unclear which version

14 controlled or whether the draft of the GSP had changed, given the lack of any guidance regarding

15 specific changes that were made.

16 132. These issues frustrate meaningful public participation in the GSP development in

17 violation of SGMA and the IWVGA's JPA Agreement and Bylaws and deny stakeholders due

18 process.

19 iv. The GSP Fails to Consider the Interests of Beneficial Uses and Users of Groundwater and Fails to Ensure Consistency with Common Law Water 20 Rights

21
133. In violation of SGMA and the IWVGA's own JPA Agreement and Bylaws, the
22 GSP fails to consider the interests of all beneficial uses and users of groundwater, specifically
23 holders of overlying groundwater rights such as agricultural users including farmers, like 24 Plaintiffs. (Wat. Code, § 10723.2.)
25
134. Instead, the GSP suggests that agricultural users are a threat to the Basin that must
26 be "restricted," and declares that irrigation for agricultural purposes is not a reasonable use of
27 water, notwithstanding Water Code section 106, which deems irrigation the second highest 28

36 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 priority use following domestic use, and Plaintiffs' lawful right to use its property for agricultural

2 purposes. (See Abatti v. Imperial Irrigation District (2020) 52 Cal.App.5th 236, 279-80.)

3 135. GSP Management Action No. 1 is to implement the "Annual Pumping Allocation

4 Plan, Transient Pool and Fallowing Program" ("Management Action No. 1"). (GSP at 5-4.)

5 Within Management Action No. 1, the "primary initial management action is the establishment of

6 annual groundwater pumping allocations"--called "Annual Pumping Allocations" -of the

7 sustainable yield of the Basin. (Ibid.) "These Annual Pumping Allocations will be used for the

8 purpose of assigning pumping fees,' i.e., because any user not granted an Annual Pumping

9 Allocation must pay a fee to continue pumping water, provided the user's pumping is not using an
BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 10 allotment granted under the "Transient Pool." (Id. at 5-4, 5-6.) These fees, called "Augmentation

11 Fees" in the GSP, and later called the "Replenishment Fee" by the IWVGA, are a per-AF fee
woL puz haong edeseay 1Z01 LLZ-LOLE6 VO 'UBQURE TUES 12 "sufficient for the acquisition of supplemental water supplies." (Id. at 5-6.)

13 136. Section 5 of the GSP explains that only certain users that produced groundwater

14 during the Base Period, defined as January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2014, will receive an

15 Annual Pumping Allocation. (GSP at 5-5 to 5-6.) The remaining groundwater users--which the

16 GSP terms "groundwater pumpers with inferior rights"-will not be given an Annual Pumping

17 Allocation. (Id. at 5-6.) Instead, the GSP explains that the inferior right holders will be "eligible"

18 to receive some unspecified share of the "Transient Pool," which is a "limited non-transferable a

19 one-time allocation of water to be used prior to 2040." (Ibid. [emphasis added].)

20 137. The Transient Pool was "created to facilitate coordinated production reductions

21 and to allow groundwater users to plan and coordinate their individual groundwater pumping

22 termination." (GSP at 5-6.) The Transient Pool is only 51,000 AFY, to be shared amongst all

23 eligible recipients. Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that each users' share of the

24 Transient Pool is sufficient only for a few years of continued groundwater production. Those

25 groundwater users that are assigned a Transient Pool allotment may be enrolled in a "Fallowing

26 Program," under which the user can elect to "sell their Transient Pool Allocation back to the

27 IWVGA." (Ibid.) "[O]nce all water in the Transient Pool has been consumed (or sold through the

28 Fallowing Program .. ), the Transient Pool will cease" and pumpers have two options: (1) cease

37 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 pumping or (2) pay a fee to continue pumping. (Ibid.)

2 138. Any water production in excess of either an Annual Pumping Allocation or :

3 Transient Pool allotment will be subject to a fee (later termed the "Replenishment Fee") "in an

4 amount that is determined to be sufficient for the acquisition of supplemental water supplies."

5 (GSP at 5-6.)

6 139. Groundwater users that the IWVGA deems to hold "inferior rights" will not be

7 granted an Annual Pumping Allocation, but will instead receive a Transient Pool allotment, only

8 if eligible. (GSP at 5-6.) As to eligibility for the Transient Pool, the GSP explains: "All

9 groundwater pumpers who were producing groundwater during the Base Period and who are not
ITI'YOTHHOS NIIHVA LIVAH NILISNMONH 10 given an Annual Pumping Allocation will be eligible to receive a Transient Pool Allocation."

11 (Ibid.)
soow puz taons edederry Izol Santa Berhara, CA 93101-2711 12 140. SGMA requires the IWVGA to consider the interests of all beneficial uses and

13 users of groundwater, including holders of overlying groundwater rights such Plaintiffs. (Wat.

14 Code, § 10723.2.) SGMA also expressly forbids the IWVGA from determining or altering water

15 rights. (Id. at § 10720.5(b) ['Nothing in this part, or in any groundwater management plan

16 adopted pursuant to this part, determines or alters surface water rights or groundwater rights

17 under common law or any provision of law that determines or grants surface water rights."]; id. at

18 10726.8(b) ['Nothing in this part shall be construed as authorizing a local agency to make a

19 binding determination of the water rights of any person or entity ..."]; see also id. at §

20 10720.1(b) ["…It is the intent of the Legislature to preserve the security of water rights in the

21 state to the greatest extent possible consistent with the sustainable management of

22 groundwater."].) Despite SGMA's clear requirements, Management Action No. and the

23 underlying modeling scenarios considered by the IWVGA Board unlawfully attempt to determine

24 the water rights of the users in the Basin and eviscerate the overlying rights held by Plaintiffs and

25 other overlying owners.

26 141. The GSP explains that "with the implementation of the Annual Pumping

27 Allocation Plan, Transient Pool and Fallowing Program, [Basin] groundwater production is

28 anticipated to reduce to around 12,000 AFY plus any agricultural pumping as part of the

38 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 Transient Pool program in the first year of implementation." (GSP at 5-7 [emphasis added]; see

2 also id. at 5-6 [only pumpers assigned Transient Pool allotment (i.e., agricultural pumpers) may

3 be enrolled in the Fallowing Program].) The GSP therefore reflects the fact that the IWVGA had

4 already determined and adjudicated that certain groundwater users, including agricultural

5 pumpers, hold "inferior rights" and will not receive any Annual Pumping Allocation, but must

6 share in some portion of the Transient Pool or else "elect" to participate in the Fallowing

7 Program, if eligible. (See, e.g., GSP at 5-6 ["The IWVGA recognizes that the safe yield is

8 significantly lower than current pumping and some groundwater pumpers with inferior rights will

9 not be granted any Annual Pumping Allocations."] [emphasis added]; id. at 5-7 ["agricultural

10 pumping" relegated to Transient Pool and Fallowing Program, rather than Annual Pumping

11 Allocation Plan].)
J00TI pur 7onS PdEEIy IZOT d'TI'XOANHOS #AHAVA LIVXA NIHISNMONg Barbara, CA 93101-2711 12 142. The GSP also made determinations as to which groundwater users hold "superior"

13 rights. For example, the GSP determines that "NAWS China Lake groundwater production is

14 considered of highest beneficial use" and that "the City [of Ridgecrest] and Kern County

15 overlying groundwater production rights are superior to all other overlying rights because public

16 entity rights may not be prescribed against." (GSP at 5-10.) The GSP further explains that: "The

17 beneficial uses of other groundwater users, including agricultural and industrial users, will

18 subsequently be evaluated based on water rights priorities. . . . Current groundwater production

19 that has existed and has been continuous prior to the establishment of NAWS China Lake will be

20 given a priority over more recent pumping that has occurred since the [Basin] has been

21 documented to be in overdraft conditions." (Id. at 5-10 to 5-11.)

22 143. Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that this is an application of a priority

23 system among competing claimants to water based upon the perceived relative value of the

24 claimants' water rights. In making such priority determinations, the GSP violates SGMA's

25 mandate that the GSP shall not determine or alter water rights. (Wat. Code, §§ 10720.5(b),

26 10726.8(b), 10720.1(b).) The GSP's water rights determinations also run contrary to established

27 precedent holding that in the absence of an appropriator having established prescriptive rights in

28 court of competent jurisdiction, all overlying owners hold prior and paramount rights superior to

39 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 all appropriators as a matter of law. (City of Barstow v. Mojave Water Agency (2000) 23 Cal.4th

2 1224, 1240-41.) Finally, the GSP's water rights determinations are illegal because they usurp the

3 role of the court. (Hillside Mem'l Park & Mortuary v. Golden State Water Co. (2011) 205

4 Cal.App.4th 534, 549 [the duty, power, and authority to determine or alter groundwater rights is

5 reserved exclusively to the courts].)

144. The GSP's exclusion of Plaintiffs from the Annual Pumping Allocation system
also violates Plaintiffs' due process rights because it infringes on Plaintiffs' overlying water

8 rights-property rights. This exclusion deprives Plaintiffs of property without due process based
on an unlawful determination of Plaintiffs' water rights. Additionally, the allocation scheme is
ITI  MOANHOS HAIHVA LLVAH NIXISNAONg 10 arbitrary and capricious and lacks any reasonable relation to a proper legislative purpose because

11 it fails to respect Plaintiffs' water rights in violation of SGMA. At the same time, the GSP lacks
ITEZ-IOIES VO EIQEA TIUES 20L1 puz 733n5 edeseuy 1Z0I 12 any evidence that Plaintiffs' pumping causes undesirable results or that that the effects of

13 Plaintiffs' pumping are different than pumping by any groundwater users granted an Annual

14 Pumping Allocation. Plaintiffs thus allege on information and belief, that the GSP fails to

15 establish a reasoned justification for its Annual Pumping Allocation system and instead arbitrarily
IWVGA's unlawful determinations of water rights to formulate the 16 and capriciously relies on

17 Annual Pumping Allocation.

18 V. GSP Management Action No. 1 Violates the Constitution Because it Requires Groundwater Users Excluded from the Annual Pumping 19 Allocation Plan to Unlawfully Subsidize Users Awarded an Allocation

20 145. The GSP explains that groundwater production in excess of either an Annual

21 Pumping Allocation or an allotment of the 51,000 AF Transient Pool will be subject to a yet-

22 undetermined fee, later named the "Replenishment Fee," "in an amount that is determined to be

23 sufficient for the acquisition of supplemental water supplies." (GSP at 5-6.) To continue

24 operations in the Basin, groundwater users excluded from the Annual Pumping Allocation but

25 given a Transient Pool allotment, are required to pay the Replenishment Fee once their Transient

26 Pool allotment is used up. Pumpers excluded from both the Annual Pumping Allocation and

27 Transient Pool must pay the Replenishment Fee as soon as it takes effect on January 1, 2021.

28 146. Therefore, the groundwater producers excluded by the IWVGA from receiving an

40 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

Annual Pumping Allocation would be responsible for payment of the majority of the

2 Replenishment Fee. Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that the result of the structure set

3 up in the GSP is to require users excluded from receiving an Annual Pumping Allocation to

4 subsidize payment for acquisition of supplemental water supplies, which will benefit all

5 groundwater producers, not just those that financed the acquisition of the supplemental supplies.

6 147. Structuring GSP Management Action No. in such a way as to require certain

7 classes of groundwater users (i.e., those excluded from the Annual Pumping Allocation Plan) to

8 subsidize other classes of users violates the constitutional requirement that fees shall bear a

9 reasonable relationship to the payor's burdens on, or benefits received from the governmental
d'VI XOHHOS NUAVA LIVAH NIZISNMONg 10 activity. (Cal. Const., Art. XIII D, Sec. 6, subd. (b)(3) ['The amount of a fee or charge imposed

11 upon any parcel or person as an incident of property ownership shall not exceed the proportional
= 12 cost of the service attributable to the parcel."]; City of San Buenaventura v. United Water [0TS6 VO 'ERqIA 10011 pur yoang edeveuy tZOt 13 Conservation Dist. (2017) 3 Cal.5th 1191, 1214 ["To qualify as a nontax 'fee' under article XIII

14 C, as amended, a charge must satisfy both the requirement that it be fixed in an amount that is "no

15 more than necessary to cover the reasonable costs of the governmental activity,' and the

16 requirement that 'the manner in which those costs are allocated to a payor bear a fair or

17 reasonable relationship to the payor's burdens on, or benefits received from, the governmental

18 activity.'].)

19 vi. The GSP Fails to Support its Denial of Proportional Allocations to All Groundwater Users On the Basis of Beneficial Uses
20

21 148. Through comments on the public review draft of the GSP, Plaintiffs and other

22 stakeholders asked the IWVGA to develop a system of proportional allocations, under which each

23 groundwater user would receive an allocation based on the cumulative requirements of all

24 beneficial uses. The IWVGA rejected this approach and instead developed the unequal system

25 described herein, under which some water users get Annual Pumping Allocations, some users get

26 one-time Transient Pool allotments, and some users, like Plaintiffs, are excluded entirely from

27 both an Annual Pumping Allocation and a Transient Pool allotment. The GSP fails to provide a

28 proper basis for the rejection of a proportional allocation system.

41 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 149. For example, the GSP makes the claim that "[e]conomically viable agricultural

2 operations cannot be sustained with a greatly reduced water supply (pumping allocation)." (GSP

3 at 5-8). However, Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that the result of entirely excluding

4 agricultural pumpers from an Annual Pumping Allocation will be to eviscerate the economic
or assess the 5 viability of agricultural operations in the Basin. The GSP fails to acknowledge

6 economic harm to agricultural pumpers associated with their exclusion from an Annual Pumping

7 Allocation and, in some cases, the Transient Pool and Fallowing Program.

8 150. Likewise, the GSP makes the claim that "domestic and municipal users would not

9 be able to meet basic health and safety requirements under a proportional reduction allocation."

10 (GSP at 5-8 to 5-9.) This claim is unsupported by evidence or explanation. The GSP does not

11 assess or analyze the amount of water required for human consumption and basic sanitation, nor
3oola poz toang edeseay Izot ITI'XOMNHOS HARHVI LIVAH NITISNMOHA CA 93101-2711 12 does it demonstrate why a proportional allocation system would be insufficient to meet "basic

13 health and safety requirements."

14 151. Moreover, Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that many of the water users

15 ultimately granted an Annual Pumping Allocation use water for non-"health and safety

16 requirements," such as the irrigation of landscaping.

17 152. The GSP also concludes that "proportional reductions to reach the Current

18 Sustainable Yield are infeasible because the majority of individual groundwater users would not

19 have a large enough allocation to maintain an acceptable quality of life and the drastic community

20 changes would impact the support of NAWS China Lake." (GSP at 5-8.) This infeasibility

21 finding, however, is unsupported and the GSP fails to explain what is meant by "an acceptable
of NAWS China Lake." 22 quality of life," "drastic community changes," and "the support

23 Moreover, the GSP fails to explain why "the support of NAWS China Lake" is a relevant factor,

24 given that the GSP indicates that the Navy will be exempt from the payment of any fees or water

25 use restrictions. (See GSP at 5-5 [the Navy will be exempt from payment of fees and has not

26 provided an accounting of its water right], 5-10 [the Navy's groundwater production will not be

27 restricted or regulated].)

vii. The GSP Fails to Substantiate the Need for Immediate Cutbacks, which 1 Violated Article X, Section 2 of the California Constitution
2

3 153. Under the GSP, any groundwater users not given an Annual Pumping Allocation

4 or a Transient Pool allotment will be immediately required to pay the Replenishment Fee.

5 154. Ultimately, the IWVGA wrongfully excluded Plaintiffs from both the Annual

6 Pumping Allocation system and the Transient Pool.

7 155. As to users granted a Transient Pool allotment, Plaintiffs allege, on information

8 and belief, that the Transient Pool allotment will only be sufficient for most users to continue

9 pumping for a few years before they are also required to pay the Replenishment Fee. The GSP
ITI*NOANHOS MNEHVA LLVAH NIZISNMOMA 10 fails to provide a reasoned basis for immediate cutbacks.

16 of maximizing use within the framework established by SGMA and the California Constitution.

17 viii. The Fallowing Program is Inadequate to Compensate Landowners for their
Investments
18

19 157. 1 Management Action No. 1 provides that all groundwater users assigned a

20 Transient Pool allotment (e.g., certain agricultural producers) would be eligible for enrollment in

21 a Fallowing Program. (GSP at 5-6.) Under the Fallowing Program, eligible groundwater pumpers

22 could "elect to sell their Transient Pool Allocation back to the IWVGA." (Id.) The GSP explains

23 that the IWVGA and participating groundwater pumpers "may also explore alternative uses for

24 the fallowed land, which may include use as enhanced habitat or grazing lands. (Id. at 5-7.) The

25 GSP estimates that the IWVGA's costs incurred pursuant to the Fallowing Program will be

26 approximately $9 million. (Id. at 5-11.)

27 158. The GSP, however, fails to provide any support for the idea that the $9 million

28 available under the Fallowing Program is sufficient to compensate landowners for their

43 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 investments. Plaintiffs alone, which have been wrongfully excluded from the Fallowing Program,

2 have expended more than $32 million on their agricultural properties overlying the Basin. The

3 Fallowing Program is therefore inadequate to protect participating water users' investment-

4 backed expectations and adequately compensate agricultural producers.

5 ix. The GSP Takes the Water Rights of Overlying Landowners Like Plaintiffs

6
159. Plaintiffs are overlying landowners with fully vested overlying water rights. By the
7 GSP's exclusion of Plaintiffs and other water users from the Annual Pumping Allocation system
8 and/or the Transient Pool, the water available to Plaintiffs for reasonable and beneficial use will
be taken by the IWVGA pursuant to the GSP and made available for public use by the Navy and
I'TT'XJINHOS MNUHVA LIVAH NIZISNMONE 10 the other public agencies given an Annual Pumping Allocation, including Kern County, the City 11
TTLZ-IOIE6 VD enqneg eyes of Ridgecrest, and the Indian Wells Valley Water District. (See, e.g., Casitas Mun. Water Dist. v. oou puz raang edroeuy 1Z0l 12 United States (Fed. Cir. 2008) 543 F.3d 1276, 1296; Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage Dist. v.
13 United States (2003) 59 Fed.CI. 246, 248-50; Baley v. United States (2017) 134 Fed. C1. 619,
14
668.)
15
160. Plaintiffs' overlying water rights are entitled to protection under SGMA, which
16 mandates that common law water rights be protected and preserved. (Wat. Code, §§ 10720.5(b),
17 10726.8(b).) The California Supreme Court has previously declared that the Legislature, let alone
18 the IWVGA, cannot limit vested inchoate appurtenant water rights for nonuse. (Tulare Irrigation
19 District v. Lindsay-Strathmore Irrigation Dist. (1935) 3 Cal.2d 489, 530-531.) Whatever 20 authority that may exist to address unexercised overlying rights in the context of a comprehensive
21 groundwater adjudication post-SGMA (Code Civ. Proc., § 830(b)(7)), those rules do not apply to 22
exercised rights such as Plaintiffs' and do not extend to IWVGA in the adoption of a GSP.
23
161. The GSP excludes Plaintiffs from receiving an Annual Pumping Allocation on the
24 erroneous alleged basis that agricultural pumpers hold "inferior rights," but does not compensate 25 Plaintiffs for this exclusion. This determination violates both SGMA and Plaintiffs' constitutional
26
rights.

X. The GSP Wrongfully Prohibits the Transfer of Transient Pool Shares

2
162. The GSP explains that the 51,000 AF Transient Pool will be allocated among
3 certain agricultural pumpers excluded from the Annual Pumping Allocation system. (GSP at 5-6.)
4 These shares, however, are non-transferrable. (Id.)
5
163. Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that transferability of Transient Pool
6 allotments would ensure that groundwater goes to the highest and best use, consistent with Article
7 X, Section 2 of the California Constitution,
8 164. In Plaintiffs' comments on the public review draft of the GSP, Plaintiffs asked the
IWVGA to update the GSP to explain the basis and rationale for the IWVGA's determination that
10 shares of the Transient Pool should be non-transferrable. The IWVGA failed to respond
11 substantively to this comment and the adopted GSP is deficient because it fails to provide any so0L1 puz 7aoug edeseury 1Z0T I'TI'YOTHOS MITAVA LIVAH NIALSNMOHH ITLZ-LOTE6 VO 'EIDqUE E EIUES 12 basis for its determination that Transient Pool shares are non-transferrable.
13
xi. The GSP is Devoid of any Scientific or Policy Rationale for Setting the Transient Pool at 51,000 AF 14

15 165. The 51,000 AF Transient Pool represents only a small proportion of GSP's
16 estimate of the amount of usable water in storage in the Basin.
17 166. The GSP, however, fails to articulate any scientific and/or policy rationale for
to some other number. 18 setting the Transient Pool allotment at 51,000 AF, as opposed
19 167. Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that the 51,000 AF Transient Pool is
20 woefully insufficient to allow agricultural production to continue until imported water is available
21 in the Basin, which the GSP estimates will not occur until approximately 2035. (GSP at 5-7.)
22 Therefore, agricultural pumpers and others denied Annual Pumping Allocations will be heavily
23 impacted by payment of the Replenishment Fee.
24 168. Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that the best available information and
25 science demonstrates that the Transient Pool could be expanded to provide sufficient water for
26 agricultural pumping to continue until imported water is brought into the Basin.

xii. The GSP Fails to Analyze the Impacts of Excluding Certain Users from the Annual Pumping Allocation system and/or the Transient Pool
2

3 169. SGMA requires the IWVGA to consider the interests of all beneficial uses and

4 users of groundwater, including holders of overlying groundwater rights such Plaintiffs. (Wat.

5 Code, § 10723.2.) The IWVGA's JPA Agreement and bylaws require the same.

6 170. Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that groundwater users excluded from

7 either or both the Annual Pumping Allocation System and/or the Transient Pool will be

8 detrimentally impacted from that exclusion. These detrimental impacts include, but are not

9 limited to, forcing the excluded pumpers out of business due to the costs of payment for the

10 Replenishment Fee.

11 171.

13 excluded from the Annual Pumping Allocation system and/or the Transient Pool.

14 xiii. The GSP Underestimates Basin Recharge and Omits Key Recharge Studies and Estimates
15

16 172. The GSP adopts the average annual Basin recharge developed by DRI and

17 designates this recharge figure as the "sustainable yield" of the Basin. (GSP at 3-14 ["The
average annual recharge developed by DRI is 7,650 AF per year (McGraw et al, 2016; Garner et 18

19 al, 2017). The recharge zones identified by DRI are shown in Figure 3-11. The total area of
miles. The area and estimated annual recharge in each zone are 20 recharge is about 770 square

21 shown in Table 3-3."]; id. at 5-4, fn. 44 ['"The safe yield is equal to the long-term average natural

22 recharge of the basin, currently estimated to be 7,650 AFY. The current estimate of the

23 sustainable yield, defined by SGMA as the maximum quantity of water that can be withdrawn

24 annually without causing undesirable results, is also currently estimated to be 7,650 AFY. The

25 sustainable yield may change as projects and management actions are implemented that

26 artificially recharge the basin and increase the volume of water that can be withdrawn annually

27 without causing undesirable results."].)

28 173. The GSP includes the following "selected" recharge estimates in Table 3-4:

46 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 Table 3-4: Notural Recharge Estimotes from Selected Recharge Studtes (AFY).

Recharge Study Natural Recharge Estimate (AFY) 2
Brown and Caldwell (2009) 8,900
3 Epsteln et al. (2010) 5,800 to 12,000

6 1 Excludes estimates of recharge from excess irrigation and distribution system leakoge.
7 174. The GSP fails to explain on what basis these natural recharge estimates were

8 "selected" and why various recharge estimates were omitted.

9 175. In particular, the GSP does not explain why the recharge estimates from the 2014
d'TT "NOUAHOS HREVA JIVAH NKLSNMONg 10 report by Todd Engineers were cherry picked to omit estimates of recharge from irrigation return

11 flows and to account for distribution system leakage. (GSP at 3-16.) No explanation is provided
J00w purz *yons ededeuy IZOT Santa Barbara, CA 93101-2711 12 as to why only natural recharge is included, despite the fact that the GSP acknowledges that

13 agricultural use is approximately 50 percent of total water use. (Id. at 3-5.) Plaintiffs allege, on

14 information and belief, that irrigation return flows contribute a substantial source of recharge to

15 the Basin; it is therefore improper to exclude return flows from recharge estimates and by

16 extension the sustainable yield calculation. It is also improper and inconsistent to exclude known

17 recharge from agricultural return flows when the GSP acknowledges that "the sustainable yield

18 may change as projects and management actions are implemented that artificially recharge the

19 [B]asin." (Id. at 5-4, fn. 44.)

20 176. Additionally, the GSP's recharge analysis is flawed because no explanation is

21 provided as to why the DRI recharge estimate (7,650 AFY) was used as the sustainable yield, as

22 opposed to any of the other "selected" recharge studies. (See GSP at 3-21 to 3-23 [7,650 AFY

23 used as the sustainable yield].)

24 177. As raised in Plaintiffs' comment letter on the public review draft of the GSP, there

25 are serious technical concerns with the DRI recharge estimate. Namely, as Plaintiffs explained:

26 [The estimate is based on the loss of storage of approximately
25,000 AFY over many years from sediments assumed in the DRI
27 model to have an average specific yield of 22 percent. This value is

28 very high for the sediments present in the Basin, especially where the groundwater is semi-confined and confined. Use of a more
47 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

reasonable value for specific yield would lower the volume of water
lost from storage, resulting in a much higher estimate of recharge. 2
xiv. The GSP Conflates Recharge with the Sustainable Yield 3

178. The GSP conflates the "estimated long-term average natural recharge to the

5 [Basin]" with "sustainable yield" and refers to its objective of making "pumping equal to

6 sustainable yield." (See, c.g., GSP at ES-11 ["DRI, in coordination with the IWV TAC, has

7 estimated the long-term average natural recharge to the IWVGB has been 7,650 AFY. This is

8 considered the Current Sustainable Yield of the Basin."].)

9 179. The focus on a Basin-wide average natural recharge estimate fails to meet the

10 definitional requirement of "operating within the sustainable yield," which requires avoiding

11 specifically and locally defined and quantified undesirable results that are technically and legally
Floor 12 supported. A d'TI*XANHOS YMHAVA LIVAH NALSNAONA TELZ-I0166 VO' hoans edesery 1701 13 180. This approach runs contrary to DWR's Best Management Practices for Sustainable

14 Management Criteria, which expressly explain that "SGMA does not incorporate sustainable

15 yield estimates directly into sustainable management criterial. Basin-wide pumping within the

16 sustainable yield estimate is neither a measure of, nor proof of sustainability. Sustainability under

17 SGMA is only demonstrated by avoiding undesirable results for the six sustainability indicators."

18 (DWR Best Management Practices Sustainable Management Criteria at 32 [emphasis added].)

19 The GSP provides no basis for the decision to deviate from express DWR Best Management

20 Practices.

21 XV. The GSP Underestimates Basin Storage and Fails to Support Storage
Estimates
22

23 181. The Indian Wells Valley is a geologic basin that has been infilled with up to 6,500-

24 feet of unconsolidated sediments. These sediments contain groundwater under perched,

25 unconfined to semi-confined, and confined conditions. The total volume of groundwater storage

26 is a function of the total volume of the aquifer, including the sediment grains and water in the

27 pore space, and the percentage of that volume that contains available groundwater.
28 182. Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that there are two basic methods for

48 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 calculating the volume of groundwater storage: analytical calculations using sediment volume and

2 specific yield, and numerical calculations using the structure of the DRI (Navy) groundwater flow

3 model employed by the IWVGA. The GSP employed the former approach to evaluating Basin

4 storage.

5 183. The GSP notes with respect to total basin storage that three sources were

6 considered:

7 Kunkel and Chase (1969), which estimated 720,000 AF of groundwater in storage

8 underlying 64,000 acres of the Basin to a depth of 100 feet below the water level

9 of March 1954;

BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLI 10 Dutcher and Moyle (1973), which estimated that in 1921 there was 2,200,000 AF

11 of groundwater in storage underlying 70,800 acres of the Basin to a depth of 200
TTAZ-I0IE6 O EqRgI jotd puz "roans edeoruy IZOI 12 feet of saturated aquifer below groundwater contour levels; and

13 USBR (1993), which estimated there was 1,020,000 AF to 3,020,000 AF of

14 groundwater in storage underlying 59,200 acres of the Basin, based on the

15 assumption of usable water in the 100 to 300 feet of saturated aquifer below

16 groundwater contour levels. (GSP at 3-25.)

17 184. All of the above estimates, however, are for limited areas (59,200 to 70,800 acres)

18 of the overall Basin, which the GSP acknowledges extends across 382,000 acres. The GSP

19 therefore underestimates the amount of water in storage in the Basin. (GSP at 2-1 [Basin

20 underlies approximately 382,000 acres].)

21 185. Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that if the storage analysis within each

22 of these studies were expanded to the entire Basin, the estimate for the volume of water in storage

23 would increase significantly, which would in turn affect the GSP's undesirable results analysis.

24 186. Plaintiffs further allege, on information and belief, that IWVGA did not articulate

25 a basis for failure to use the Navy's model to estimate the volume of water in storage as of 2019,

26 despite the fact that the GSP states the model was used to calculate annual changes of

27 groundwater storage based on historical pumping. (GSP at 3-26.)

28 187. In Plaintiffs' January 8, 2020 comments on the public review draft of the GSP,

49 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 submitted through their counsel, Plaintiffs asserted that the following questions must be answered

2 to inform the ultimate question of how much water is stored in the Basin:

3 What is the total volume of the basin within the model domain?
What is the total volume of water (all qualities) within the basin within the model

5 domain?

6 How much water is in Layer 1 of the model?

7 How much water is in Layers 2-3 of the model?

8 How much water in in Layers 4-6 of the model?

9 How much of the water within these layers is fresh versus brackish?

10 Where are the fresh versus brackish resources located within the basin volume? TT NOMNHOS HATAVA LIVAH NIISNMONA 11 188. The IWVGA adopted the GSP without updating the model to examine the amount
ILZ-10IE6 VC RIqIH R wola puz tang edroeuy tZ0t 12 of water in storage in the Basin or answer any of these questions.

13 xvi. The Undesirable Results Analysis Fails to Incorporate the Best Available Science and Information
14

15 189, SGMA requires that each GSP be capable of meeting SGMA's sustainability goal,

16 which means avoiding statutorily defined, significant and unreasonable undesirable results

17 through implementation of projects and management actions. (Wat. Code, §§ 10727, 10727.2,

18 10721(u), (v), (x).)

19 190. In turn, the SGMA Regulations require that the GSP establish minimum numeric
cause undesirable results. 20 thresholds which represent a point in the Basin that, if exceeded, may

21 (23 Cal. Code Regs., § 354.28(a).) Among other things, the GSP must also explain which

22 information and criteria were relied upon by the IWVGA to justify each minimum threshold,

23 explain how the minimum thresholds will avoid undesirable results, and explain how the

24 established minimum thresholds may affect the interests of beneficial uses and users of

25 groundwater. (Ibid.) Each of these minimum thresholds must be evaluated and established on the

26 basis of the best available science and information. (See id.)

27 191. The GSP's undesirable results analysis fails to comply with these requirements.

28 The GSP poorly defines undesirable results and largely fails to clearly articulate when they are

50 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 significant and unreasonable. Where the GSP attempts to define what is significant and

2 unreasonable, the articulation is based on weak and biased scientific analysis, particularly with

3 regard to water in storage, recharge estimates, and domestic well impacts.

4 192. For example, the GSP fails to provide any compelling analysis regarding threats to

5 shallow groundwater wells and the best available information and science that this threat is

6 theoretical and unsupported (i.e., speculative, at best). Even if it were not, a physical solution

7 exists to mitigate impacts to users of shallow wells.

8 193. Likewise, the GSP's failure to incorporate the best available and most accurate

9 information and science regarding Basin recharge and storage causes defects throughout the

ATI'MJUIHOS MAHAVA LLVAH NIXISNMOMH 10 GSP's discussion of undesirable results, including impacts to shallow wells.

11 xvii. In Addition to the Examples Above, the GSP Otherwise Fails to Comply
with SGMA and DWR's SGMA Regulations ITLZ-TOTE6 V: Rmqrea J00L pur eans edeseuy 12

13 194. The comment letters by Plaintiffs and other stakeholders detail many other specific

14 violations of SGMA and the SGMA Regulations and deviations from DWR's GSP Best § 15 Management Practices and Guidance Documents. The identified deficiencies include, but are not

16 limited to:

17 a. The GSP selects a hydrogeologic period and baseline conditions for the historical

18 water budget that do not follow standard practices or SGMA Regulations, which

19 specify the GSP should review information "extending back a minimum of 10

20 years, or as is sufficient to calibrate and reduce the uncertainty of the tools and

21 methods used." (23 Cal. Code Regs., § 354.18(C)(2)(B).)

22 b. The GSP selects hydrogeologic conditions for 2011 to 2015 for the historical water

23 budget and baseline conditions, which corresponds to drought climatic conditions,

24 rather than select a 10 year period as required by the SGMA Regulations (see, e.g.,

25 Exh. D at 3, 12, & 69).

26 c. Relatedly, the GSP lacks adequate historical data, stating that data tracking is only

27 fairly recent and that certain historical data points are based only on a single

28 measurement recorded at the time of well installation. (See, e.g., GSP at ES-15,

51 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 ES-16 ["The existing TDS database has 2,051 water quality data from 1920 to

2 present. Most of the data have been collected during field work that included only

3 a limited number of wells, or a one-time sample when the well was drilled."].)

4 a. The GSP water budget did not consider climate change as required by the SGMA

5 Regulations (23 Cal. Code Regs., § 354.18(c)(3)(A), (d)(3), (e)) or utilize the

6 approach recommended by DWR's GSP Best Management Practices and
Guidance Documents. 7

8 b. The IWVGA did not operate its TAC consistent with its bylaws, for example,

9 IWVGA failed set agendas and provide adequate time to review meeting materials

10 in advance of the meeting. 'TT YTHHOS SRUHVA LIVAH NIGISNMONH 11 c. IWVGA's process to develop, inter alia, the groundwater model, sustainable
ITAZ-TOTE6 VO 'eEqregR JooL puz YOAS EReUY IZOI 12 management criteria, including measurable objectives, interim objectives,

13 minimum thresholds, and undesirable results, and projects and management

14 actions lacked adequate peer review.

15 d. The IWVGA allegedly selected sustainable management criteria using Model

16 Scenario 6.2 that is based on (1) an unreleased model that does not rely on the best

17 available information and science, includes project and management actions, and

18 fails to adequately demonstrate avoidance of undesirable results, rather than

19 employ the processes described in DWR's SGMA Regulations and GSP Best

20 Management Practices and Guidance Documents (see, e.g., Exh. C at 11-12).

21 e. The GSP fails to explain why it did not use the most current estimated available

22 storage from both the DRI (Navy) model and the IWVGA Water Resources

23 Manager evaluations that estimate usable groundwater storage of over ten (10)

24 million acre feet, which indicate the Basin has experienced a fraction of the

25 amount of lost storage (i.e., a loss of 0.3% of storage per year between 1992 and

26 2015) over the approach selected in the GSP that overestimates loss of storage (see

27 Exh. D at 12).

28 f. The GSP fails to justify the selection of 10 wells to monitor sustainable

52 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

management criteria when DWR GSP Best Management Practices recommend a
2 minimum of 24-60 monitoring well locations for a basin of this size and water

3 usage (see Exh. D at 20).

g. The GSP fails to explain the logic behind the contaminated, "de-designated"
groundwater area below China Lake and why it "will not be addressed by projects

6 and management actions," given that this "de-designated" arca comprises

7 hundreds of thousands of acre-feet or more of groundwater that could be available

8 for beneficial uses and users (see Exh. C at 19-20, 37; Exh. D at 73).

9 h. The GSP's Annual Pumping Allocation, which grants some users all of their

10 present demand, fails to comply with SGMA's obligation to manage the Basin
11 "consistent with Section 2 of Article X of the California Constitution." (Wat.
TILZ-10I66 VO RIQIEA qJuES 10tu puz *oanS edeseuy IZOT d'TI'NOANNOS INAAVI LIVAH NIAISNMOHA 12 Code, § 10720.5(a); Cal. § Const., Art. X, § 2. ['"[T]he water resources of the State

13 be put to beneficial use to the fullest extent of which they are capable, and that the

14 waste or unreasonable use or unreasonable method of use of water be prevented,

15 and that the conservation of such waters is to be exercised with a view to the

16 reasonable and beneficial use thereof in the interest of the people and for the

17 public welfare."].)

18 i The GSP misleadingly states that the Annual Pumping Allocation Plan, Transient

19 Pool and Fallowing Program "may" be subject to environmental review. (See, e.g.,

20 GSP at 5-11.) This statement is misleading because it offers only the possibility

21 that such implementation would be exempt from those environmental

22 requirements, whereas SGMA expressly provides that projects to implement a

23 GSP are subject to CEQA. (Wat. Code, § 10728.6.)

24 195. Plaintiffs further hereby incorporate all other stakeholder comment letters

2 E. The IWVGA Failed to Proceed in the Manner Required by Law in Adopting the Extraction Fee on Tuly 16, 2020 3

4 197. On July 16, 2018, IWVGA adopted Ordinance No. 02-18, Establishing the Rules,

5 Regulations and Procedures for the Imposition and Collection of Groundwater Extractions Fees

6 (the "Initial Extraction Fee"). The Initial Extraction Fee was set at $30 per AF of water extracted

7 from the Basin, and was purportedly intended to finance the estimated costs to develop and adopt

8 the GSP.

9 198. On June 17, 2020, hours in advance of the Board's June 18, 2020 meeting,

10 IWVGA released draft Ordinance No. 02-20, Amending Ordinance No. 02-18 Establishing
I'I'NOTHOS HNAHVI LIVAH NIALSNMONH 11 Groundwater Extraction Fees and the Rules, Regulations and Procedures for Their Imposition,
LUZ-LOLE6 VO EEqIeg 1021 Anacapa Street, 2ad Floor 12 along with an associated June 18, 2020 Staff Report containing the limited data available on the

13 proposed fee increase. Ordinance No. 02-20 was proposed to adopt the revised Extraction Fee

14 pursuant to Water Code section 10730.

15 199. Plaintiffs submitted a comment letter, through their counsel, addressing several

16. substantive and procedural defects in the revised Extraction Fee on June 18, 2020 prior to the

17 IWVGA Board meeting, notwithstanding the fact that the IWVGA allowed less than 24 hours for

18 public comment on the late-released agenda packet. A true and correct copy of Plaintiffs' June 18,

19 2020 comment letter is attached hereto as Exhibit H, and incorporated herein by reference as

20 though fully set forth herein.

21 200. Any fee imposed to recover costs associated with the preparation of a GSP, such as

22 the Extraction Fee, must meet an exemption to the definition of a "tax" under article XIII C,

23 section 1(e) of the California Constitution ("Proposition 26") or be adopted by supermajority

24 voter approval.

25 201. The IWVGA bears the burden of proof under the preponderance of evidence

26 standard that the Extraction Fee is not a tax. Simply stating that the fee is a "regulatory fee"

27 without further analysis is not sufficient to meet the IWVGA's burden of proof. Absent such

28 analysis and proof, the Extraction Fee is a tax under California law, requiring supermajority voter

1 approval and cannot be imposed administratively as the IWVGA has done.

2 202. As detailed in Plaintiffs' comments, the proposed Extraction Fee suffered serious

3 substantive and procedural flaws. Plaintiffs notified the IWVGA that the Extraction Fee was

4 flawed because it would be used to pay for projects and management actions to implement the

5 GSP. Water Code section 10730 does not allow funding GSP implementation with a fee adopted

6 pursuant this statute. Rather, for fees imposed to implement the GSP, SGMA requires that such a

7 fee shall be adopted in compliance with the procedures set forth in Water Code section 10730.2,

8 which include compliance with specific requirements set forth in Article XIII D, Section 6 of the

9 California Constitution.

10 203. Plaintiffs' comments provided several example budget items listed in the June 18, I'TI NOTIHOS XTGHVI LIVAH NIAISNMONg 11 that would be disallowed under Water Code section 10730, including: 2020 Staff Report
TTAZ-TOTE6 YO 1 Joo1d puz 77045 vdesway IZOI 12 "Brackish Water Study Coordination; Imported Water Coordination for GSP; Allocation Process

13 Development; and Fallowing Program Development." Plaintiffs explained that because these

14 budget items pertained to projects and management actions under the GSP, these items must be

15 paid through a fee legally adopted under the procedures set forth in Water Code section 10730.2.

16 204. Additionally, Plaintiffs notified the IWVGA that the Extraction Fee could not be
validly adopted at the June 18, 2020 IWVGA Board meeting under the procedures set forth in
Water Code section 10730(b)(3) which requires a GSP to "make available to the public data upon 17

18

19 which the proposed fee is based" "[a]t least 20 days prior to" the public meeting required to be

20 held before fee adoption. (Wat. Code, § 10730(b)(1)-(3).)

21 205. The IWVGA scheduled Ordinance No. 02-20 for discussion at its July 16, 2020

22 meeting.

23 206. Within hours of release of the Board packet for the July 16, 2020 IWVGA Board

24 meeting, Plaintiffs, through their counsel, again submitted comments dated July 15, 2020 on the

25 proposed Extraction Fee. A true and correct copy of Plaintiffs' July 15, 2020 comment letter is

26 attached hereto as Exhibit I, and incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein.

27 207. In those comments, Plaintiffs questioned the need for the $7,059,574 Extraction

28 Fee budget and raised the issue that the budget still contained the following line items that could

55 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

F not be adopted pursuant to Water Code section 10730 because they are necessary to implement

2 the GSP and therefore must be paid for with a fee validly adopted under Water Code section

3 10730.2:

4 "Stetson - Imported Water Coordination for GSP;"

5 "Stetson - Allocation Process Development;"

6 "Stetson - Pumping Verification;"

7 "Stetson - Sustainable Yield Report;"

8 "Stetson - Fallowing Program Development;"

9 "Stetson - Water Importation Marketing Analysis for GSP;"

10 Any other "Additional Tasks," to the extent these costs are related to GSP
implementation;
1021 Anacapa Street, 2nd Floor ITI *NOHHOS MAHEVA LIVAH NILLSNMONA 11

12 "Legal Costs," to the extent these costs are to defend challenges to the GSP

13 implementation actions;
ERqRA BIIES 14 "TWVGA Support Costs," to the extent these costs are related to GSP

15 implementation; and

16 "TWVGA Administrative Costs," to the extent these costs are related to GSP

17 implementation.

18 208. Plaintiffs, through their counsel, also asked for clarification of the nature of other

19 budget line items, which appeared potentially related to GSP implementation.

20 209. Procedurally, Plaintiffs' letter identified that it was inappropriate for the Board to

21 adopt the Extraction Fee Ordinance because much of the information and data on the proceed to

22 Extraction fee initially provided to the public on June 17, 2020 had changed significantly and the

23 IWVGA had not met the procedural requirements set forth in Water Code section 10730(b),

24 requiring provision of supporting data to the public at least 20 days in advance of the public

25 meeting held prior to fee adoption.

26 210. Plaintiffs' letter also identified that the calculation of the Extraction Fee was

27 unsupported because it was purportedly based on the "Sustainable Yield Allocation" developed

28 by the IWVGA after completion of the GSP. Under this Sustainable Yield Allocation, the Navy

56 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 would be allowed to continue current pumping of 1,450 AFY and certain other pumpers,

2 including "De Minimis Wells," the City of Ridgecrest, Kern County, Indian Wells Valley Water

3 District, Inyokern CSD, mutual water companies, and domestic users in the town of Trona would

4 be allowed to use the portion of the Basin's sustainable yield allocated to the Navy, but not used

5 by the Navy. Plaintiffs' letter explained that reliance on the Sustainable Yield Allocation is

6 flawed for reasons including that a federal reserved water right cannot be transferred off a federal

7 reservation (i.e., the Navy base) and gifted to or exercised by non-federal entities.

8 211. Finally, Plaintiffs' letter raised the issue that it was unclear which groundwater

9 users would be subject to the Extraction Fee and the basis for this determination.

10 212. Despite these comments by Plaintiffs and others, the IWVGA unanimously I'TI'XONNIOS ANHAVA LIYAH NIILSNMOXA 11 adopted the Extraction Fee as proposed at the July 16, 2020 IWVGA Board meeting. The
ITLZ-TOTS6 V. Joot puz haans edeseuy IZOl 12 Extraction Fee provides that "all groundwater extractions from and within the Basin shall be

13 subject to measurement and the Groundwater Extraction Fee of ten dollars and fifty cents

14 ($10.50) per tenth (.10) of an acre foot for all groundwater extracted from the Basin. The

15 Groundwater Extraction Fee shall be determined and paid monthly with water extraction
16  measurements rounded down to the nearest tenth (.10) of an acre foot per month." Thus, the

17 Extraction Fee is now $105 per AF--nearly 3.5 times the Initial Extraction Fee.

18 213. At the July 16, 2020 IWVGA Board meeting Indian Wells Valley Water District

19 legal counsel Jim Worth admitted that changes had been made to the Extraction Fee data package

20 after June 25, 2020 and within the 20 days prior to July 16, 2020 meeting, but contended that the

21 changes were limited only to "taking things away" and that "more things could be taken away in

22 the future as well:"

23 We posted a data package June 20, June 25th, 20 days prior to the public meeting that were that we're conducting right now. The only
24 change was a staff report and it really contains reductions in the fee and not, and we haven't added anything since June 25th, only 25 taking things away. And more things could be taken away in the future as well. So I do believe we have met the 20-day notice a couple times now staff 26 requirement and again, I've said this
27 worked closely with Stetson and Heather in particular, in identifying tasks that we believe are quote preparation costs and 28 appropriate under 10730.2, 10730 I'm sorry. So I believe that the

57 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 expenditures are appropriate and that the notice has been met and I'll defer to Phil and Keith if they think, if they have a different 2 opinion.

3 214. As to the question of which pumpers would bear the Extraction Fee, Mr. Worth

4 explained:

5 The pumpers that are going to be subject to this groundwater extraction fee are going to be those that are identified in the data 6 package. The pumpers, if you're pumping transient pool water that will not be subject to this fee. There's no, as to the second question, 7 there's no link between the groundwater extraction fee and the
8 replenishment fee. There will be some pumpers that are required to pay the replenishment fee and pay the groundwater extraction fee 9 and then there are some that will just pay the groundwater extraction fee. We're still going through some of the processes so I
JTI YONHOS MASIVA LIVAH NILLSNMONA 10 can't give you a specific list of who's going to be subject to the
11 replenishment fee, that process is still going forward but that's my
answer.
LIAZ-LOLE6 VO 'RIBQIRE INES 1OLt puz tpang edeseay IZOl 12 The data package, however, does not specify which groundwater users are subject to the fee.
13 215. IWVGA staff and decision-makers did not otherwise meaningfully respond to the
14 concerns raised by Plaintiffs.
15 216. Given the IWVGA's failure to address Plaintiffs' concerns, the Extraction Fee is

deficient in the following ways, among others: 16

17 a. The Extraction Fee was illegally adopted pursuant to Water Code section 10730
18 because it will fund various items that can only be funded pursuant to fee validly
19 adopted under Water Code section 10730.2. The Extraction Fee cannot legally be
20 used to pay for the projects and management actions specified in its proposed
budget under Water Code section 10730, which is limited to fees used to pay for 21

22 the costs of : groundwater sustainability program, including, but not limited to,
23 preparation, adoption, and amendment of a GSP, and investigations, inspections,
24 compliance assistance, enforcement, and program administration, including a
25 prudent reserve. (Wat. Code, § 10730(a).) Section 10730 does not permit a GSA to
26 use a fee to pay for any projects and management actions to implement a GSP.
27 Such fees must be adopted pursuant to the authority and procedures outlined in
28

58 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION POR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

Water Code section 10730.2, namely certain Constitutional requirements

2 including: (1) identifying the parcels upon which the fee shall be imposed, (2)

3 calculating the fee to be imposed for each parcel, (3) providing written notice by

4 mail of the proposed fee to the record owner of each parcel, the amount of the fee
to be imposed upon each parcel, the basis upon which the amount of the proposed

6 fee was calculated, and the reason for the fee, together with the date, time, and

7 location of a public hearing on the proposed fee or charge, (4) conducting a public
hearing upon the proposed fee or charge not less than 45 days after mailing the
notice of the proposed fee to the record owners of each identified parcel, (5)
I'TT'NOUNHOS HATAVA LLVAH NITISNMOJA 10 considering all protests against the proposed fee at public hearing, and (6) if

11 written protests against the proposed are presented by a majority of owners of the
wooL puz qpang edeseuy 1: ITLZ-EOTE6 VD enqreg mES 12 identified parcels, the agency shall not impose the fee or charge. (Cal. Const., Art.

13 XIII D, Sec. 6, subd. (a).) IWVGA did not comply with any of these procedural

14 requirements in adopting the Extraction Fee. As such, to the extent the Extraction

15 Fee was adopted to fund projects and managements fees, it was adopted for an

16 illegal purpose and must be set aside.

17 b. Moreover, IWVGA has failed to provide sufficient information to evaluate

18 whether certain identified budget items are ineligible to be financed through a fee

19 adopted under Water Code section 10730. The IWVGA failed to meet its

20 obligation to provide sufficient documentation associated with each budget item in

21 order to provide pumpers with the ability to assess whether the proposed fee

22 increase complies with SGMA.

23 c. Further, nowhere in its Extraction Fee adoption findings did IWVGA address the
of the California Constitutional requirements for the imposition of 24 applicability

25 fees (see Cal. Const., Arts. XIII C [Proposition 26] and XIII D [Proposition 218].)

26 Where IWVGA did not make findings that adoption of the Extraction Fee is

27 exempt from the requirements of Proposition 26 and/or Proposition 218, the

28 procedural and substantive requirements set forth therein should have been

59 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 complied with, but were not. (Cal. Const., Art. XIII C, Sec. 1, subd. (e)(7)

2 [specifying, inter alia, that "local government bears the burden of proving by a

3 preponderance of the evidence that a levy, charge, or other exaction is not a tax"].)

4 d. Pursuant to the procedural requirements set forth in Water Code section 10730(b),

5 IWVGA could not legally adopt the Extraction Fee at its July 16, 2020 meeting

6 because the data on which the proposed fee was based changed within the 20 days

7 leading up to adoption of the Extraction Fee. Therefore, the IWVGA failed to

8 comply with the requirement that "at least 20 days prior to the meeting" it provide
the public with the data upon which the proposed fee is based. (Wat. Code, §
10730(b)(3).) I'TT'NOINHOS NXIHVA LIVAH NIILSNMONA 10

11 e. The Extraction Fee is also invalid because its calculation is based on the illegally-
IILZ-TOTE6 VO LEqET EqUES Jootl paz 790451 1021 Anacapi 12 adopted Sustainable Yield Allocation, which itself lacks a valid legal basis

13 because, inter alia, the Navy's federal reserve water right cannot be transferred off

14 the Navy base and gifted to or exercised by non-federal entities.

15 f. Finally, the Extraction Fee must be set aside because it was adopted without

16 specificity as to which groundwater users would be subject to the fee.

17 F. The IWVGA Failed to Proceed in the Manner Required by Law in Re- adopting the Extraction Fee on December 17, 2020 18
217. On December 17, 2020, IWVGA adopted Ordinance No. 05-20 Amending
19 Ordinance No. 02-18 Establishing Groundwater Extraction Fees and the Rules, Regulations and
20 Procedures For Their Imposition (Readopted Extraction Fee"). Ordinance No. 05-20 was 21 presented as a "readoption" of the fee increase from $30.00 to $105.00, initially adopted pursuant 22
to Ordinance No. 02-20 on July 16, 2020, in response to "litigation", believing it "more cost 23 effective and time efficient to readopt the fee increase and address the alleged deficiencies in
24 Ordinance No. 02-20 than to defend the challenges in the pending lawsuits." Ordinance No. 05-20
25
was again adopted pursuant to Water Code section 10730. 26
218. In its December 16, 2020 comment letter, attached hereto as Exhibit Z, Plaintiffs
27
identified and raised the same substantive and procedural deficiencies in Ordinance No. 05-20 as
28

60 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 raised with respect to the adoption of Ordinance No. 02-20, namely:

2 a. On information and belief, Ordinance No. 05-20 was not made available to the

3 public on November 24, 2020, as promised by IWVGA, and the IWVGA did not

4 provide the data package to the public by email, as is customary with agendas and

5 supporting materials. Therefore, it is unclear that the IWVGA actually achieved

6 compliance with Water Code section 10730(b)'s notice requirements.

7 b. Ordinance No. 05-20 was improperly adopted pursuant to Water Code section

8 10730, because it approved budget line items that should have been adopted
Water Code Section 10730.2. The December 17, 2020 staff report 9 pursuant to

10 states that "most" of the tasks identified "began before GSP adoption"--implicitly TT'NJANHOS INHAVA LIVAH NTALSNMONE 11 admitting that some of the line items will fund post-GSP groundwater management
ILZ-TOTE6 VO weqIeg e Joot puz yeang edrewy Twol 12 actions.

13 C. The accompanying staff report did not provide sufficient information to evaluate

14 whether certain budget items are eligible for financing through a fee adopted under

15 Water Code section 10730.

16 d. The Ordinance No. 05-20 Readopted Extraction Fee findings fail to address the

17 applicability of requirements of the California Constitution applicable to the

18 imposition of fecs and failed to comply with the procedural requirements imposed

19 by the California Constitution.
Extraction Fee remains invalid because it is predicated on the 20 e. The Readopted

21 allocations illegally-adopted pursuant to the "Sustainable Yield Allocation" and

22 Sustainable Yield Report developed and adopted by the IWVGA after completion

23 and adoption of the GSP, under which the United States Navy's federal reserved

24 water right would purportedly be transferred off a federal reservation and gifted to

25 non-federal entities.

26 f. It remains unclear which pumpers are subject to the Readopted Extraction Fee and

27 the basis for the determination.

28

61 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

P 219. Additionally, Plaintiffs objected to the IWVGA's denial of its request to refund the

2 Extraction Fee payments made after the effective date of Ordinance No. 02-20 and prior to the

3 effective date of Ordinance No. 05-20.

4 220. IWVGA adopted Ordinance No. 05-20 without modifications over Plaintiffs'

5 objections with respect to Ordinance Nos. 02-20 and 02-18, and refused to address any of the

6 previously identified inadequacies and deficiencies.

7 G. The IWVGA Failed to Proceed in the Manner Required by Law in Adopting the Sustainable Yield Report on July 16, 2020
8

9 221. The IWVGA adopted the Sustainable Yield Report and all the findings therein in

10 Resolution No. 06-20, Adopting a Report on the Indian Wells Valley Groundwater Basin's BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LL 11 Sustainable Yield of 7,650 AF, dated June 18, 2020. Although Resolution No. 06-20 is dated June
TTZZ-TOTE6 VO eqege Jop1 puz 73ans edoeuy IZOl 12 18, 2020, it was not actually adopted until the IWVGA Board's July 16. 2020 meeting.

13 222. The IWVGA released its draft Sustainable Yield Report in June 2020, just hours in

14 advance of the IWVGA's June 18, 2020 Board meeting.

15 223. Plaintiffs submitted a comment letter to the IWVGA Board, through their counsel,

16 regarding the deficiencies identified in the draft Sustainable Yield Report on June 18, 2020. (Exh.

17 H.)

18 224. The IWVGA failed to address Plaintiffs June 18, 2020 comments and issued a
19 substantially similar final version of the Sustainable Yield Report just prior to the July 16, 2020

20 IWVGA Board meeting. Again Plaintiffs, through their counsel, submitted comments on the

21 Sustainable Yield Report on July 15, 2020. (Exh. I.) Again, the IWVGA ignored Plaintiffs'

22 comments. On July 16, 2020 over Plaintiffs objections the IWVGA adopted the Sustainable Yield

23 Report.

24 225. As noted in Plaintiffs' comment letters, the Sustainable Yield Report states that its

25 purpose is "determining the colorable legal claims to the Basin's sustainable yield." The

26 Sustainable Yield Report concludes "the Basin's entire [7,650 AFY] sustainable yield is subject

27 to [the Navy's] Federal Reserve interest and is therefore beyond the jurisdiction of the Authority

28 to regulate pursuant to Water Code 8 10720.3." On this basis, the Sustainable Yield Report

62 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 determines that allocations should not be awarded to any pumpers. It further concludes that all

2 groundwater users in the Basin, except "De Minimis Extractors" as defined in Water Code section

3 10721(e) and "Federal Extractors," including the BLM and the Navy, "are beneficially impacted

4 by IWVGA's overdraft mitigation and augmentation projects and therefore it is not necessary to

5 establish allocations for any extractor." Accordingly, the Sustainable Yield Report finds that all

6 groundwater extractors, other than De Minimis Extractors and Federal Extractors "are extracting

7 water beyond the sustainable yield and will be subject to the costs for overdraft mitigation and

8 augmentation projects, unless an extractor obtains a court order showing they have quantifiable

9 production rights superior to the Navy's." Therefore, the Sustainable Yield Report determines:
J'TT'YOTHHOS HAAHVA LIVXH NIAISNMOHg 10 "all pumping should be treated equally."

11 226. As raised in Plaintiffs' comment letters, the Sustainable Yield Report suffers from
'emqre ar tmes TELZ-I0186 VO J00t puz '733175 1021 Anacapa 12 numerous flaws. First, there is an inadequate factual basis because the GSP fails to substantiate

13 the conclusion that the sustainable yield of the Basin is truly 7,650 AFY due to the flaws in the

14 GSP's Basin recharge analysis and because the GSP ignores the vast amount of usable
15 groundwater in storage that could be produced to satisfy existing groundwater dependent

16 beneficial uses without causing a single "undesirable result" and that monitoring and physical

17 mitigation measures could reduce any identified risk to insignificance. Plaintiffs allege, on

18 information and belief, that there are no undesirable results at the current pumping rate of
19 approximately 28,500 AFY-there is no subsidence, no water quality degradation, and no direct

20 evidence of adverse impacts on domestic wells attributable to groundwater pumping projected

21 maximum depletion is approximately 0.15 percent per annum.

22 227. Second, the Sustainable Yield Report is flawed because there is no factual or legal

23 support for the Sustainable Yield Report's conclusion that the Navy is entitled to the entire 7,650

24 AFY sustainable yield of the Basin. Figure 1 of Sustainable Yield Report itself acknowledges that

25 the Navy's current production is approximately 1,400 AFY, and on a declining trend. (See

26 Sustainable Yield Report, Figure 1.) Consistent with Figure 1 of the Sustainable Yield Report, the

27 Groundwater Extraction Fee data package explains that, at present, the Navy pumps

28 approximately 1,450 AFY. Further, in a letter to the IWVGA dated June 17, 2019, the Navy

63 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 explained that in November 2018 it "provided a figure of 2,041 acre-feet per year [to the

2 IWVGA] as the amount of water the installation could agree to use under a GSP." Consistent with

3 that letter, at the June 18, 2020 IWVGA Board meeting, NAWS Commander Benson explained

4 that the Navy "agreed to their allocation of 2,041 acre-feet." There is no basis for granting the

5 Navy the entire sustainable yield of the Basin where the Navy now produces less than 20 percent

6 of the Basin's sustainable yield as determined by the Sustainable Yield Report and admits that an

7 allocation of approximately 27 percent of the sustainable yield will suffice in the future.

8 228. Third, the Sustainable Yield Report is premised on a faulty legal foundation. The

9 stated purpose of the report-"determining the colorable legal claims to the Basin's sustainable

10 yield"--is expressly prohibited by SGMA, which forecloses GSAs from issuing water rights

11 determinations. (See, e.g., Wat. Code, §§ 10720.5(b), 10720.1(b), 10726.8(b).) A determination
ITLZ-T0TE6 YO 'urequg MUC POE AMKIS RIN EZOSE d'TT*XOMHHOS IIHVA LIVAH NILISNMONg 12 that the Navy is entitled to the entire sustainable yield of the Basin and that the Navy holds

13 paramount rights "unless an extractor obtains a court order showing they have quantifiable

14 production rights superior to the Navy's" is inherently a water rights determination. Such

15 determinations cannot be made by a GSA. Rather, the duty, power, and authority to determine or

16 alter groundwater rights is reserved exclusively to the courts. (Hillside Mem'l Park & Mortuary v.

17 Golden State Water Co. (2011) 205 Cal.App.4th 534, 549.)

18 229. Fourth, the Sustainable Yield Report falsely states that "all groundwater extractors

19 in the Basin, with the exclusion of De Minimis Extractors and Federal Extractors, will be subject

20 to the costs for overdraft mitigation and augmentation projects.' Although this should be the case,

21 it is not what the IWVGA actually proposed or adopted. Rather, through the allocations awarded

22 in the Replenishment Fee, the IWVGA selectively foisted the entire burden of "overdraft

23 mitigation and augmentation projects" on Plaintiffs and select other water users by exempting the

24 City of Ridgecrest, Kern County, the Indian Wells Valley Water District, Inyokern CSD, mutual

25 water companies, domestic users in the town of Trona, and the Navy from payment of the

26 Replenishment Fee. The IWVGA's rationale is that these chosen water users are able to use a

27 portion of the Navy's 7,650 AFY "federal reserved water right" through what the IWVGA calls

28 "Navy pronouncement." Plaintiffs assert this is an arbitrary and capricious effort to confiscate

64 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT
21886725.5

1 private property for the benefit of public agencies and the Navy. This scheme is illegal and raises

2 numerous questions that the IWVGA failed to address, including:

3 What is the factual and legal basis for the determination that the exempted users

4 are entitled to continue pumping at current levels without payment of the

5 Replenishment Fee?

6 Which water users will be cut back if the Navy increases production over 1,450

7 AFY, and on what basis?

8 Why are Plaintiffs and certain other water users being asked to bear the burden of

9 subsidizing overdraft mitigation and augmentation projects, while others can
d'TI'XOIHHOS EGAVA LIVAH NIAISNMOHH 10 continue pumping at current levels without being asked to share in shortages or

11 increase efficiency?
ITLZ-TOTE6 VO' J001x poz yoang edeoeuy 1Z0l 12 Assuming the Basin's entire sustainable yield belongs to the Navy (which it does

13 not), what authority does the IWVGA have to carve up and dole out most of the

14 sustainable yield to non-federal pumpers?

15 230. Finally, as set forth in Section IX.I., the IWVGA failed to proceed in the manner

16 required by law in adopting the Sustainable Yield Report without studying the environmental

17 impacts of the decision as required under CEQA. The Sustainable Yield Report will have

18 potentially significant environmental impacts associated with widespread fallowing resulting

19 from the IWVGA's strategic elimination of agriculture, including, but not limited to, impacts on

20 air quality, human health, greenhouse gas emissions, biological resources, aesthetics, and local

21 economies.

22 H. The IWVGA Failed to Proceed in the Manner Required by Law in Adopting the Transient Pool and Fallowing Program on August 21, 2020 23

24 231. The IWVGA adopted the Transient Pool and Fallowing Program and all findings

25 in the report thereon in Resolution No. 05-20, Adoption of Report on Transient Pool and

26 Fallowing Program, dated August 21, 2020.

27 232. The IWVGA's Transient Pool and Fallowing Program relies on the Pumping

28 Verification Report received, adopted, and filed on August 20, 2020, but not pursuant to an

65 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

IWVGA Board resolution. Plaintiffs' challenge to the Transient Pool and Fallowing Program

2 adopted on August 21, 2020 incorporates a challenge to the underlying Pumping Verification
Report received, adopted, and filed on August 20, 2020.

233. The report on the Transient Pool and Fallowing Program concludes that Plaintiffs

5 are "'potentially' qualified Base Period agricultural pumpers" on the basis that Plaintiffs pumped

6 groundwater during the "Base Period" of January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2014. The
IWVGA, however, omitted Plaintiffs from the Transient Pool and Fallowing Program on the basis

8 that Plaintiffs "did not timely submit the required Pumping Verification Questionnaire. As such,

9 the Authority is unable to properly verify the needed data and it would be legally inappropriate to

10 BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LL include and/or consider them for the Transient Pool."

11 234. A true and correct copy of the Pumping Verification Questionnaire
ITAZ-I01E6 VO EARQIRE RCES Joold pur yaang edeeuy 170l 12 ("Questionnaire") referenced in the report on the Transient Pool and Fallowing Program is

13 attached hereto as Exhibit J. The Questionnaire identifies a March 1, 2020 due date, but does not

14 provide notice to the answering party that failure to submit the requested data on or before March

15 1, 2020 carries a forward forfeiture of the right to participate in the yet undefined Transient Pool

16 and Fallowing Program.

17 235. Plaintiffs, through their counsel, submitted a comment letter to the IWVGA Board

18 regarding the deficiencies identified in the draft report on the Transient Pool and Fallowing

19 Program on June 18, 2020. (Exh. H.)

20 236. The IWVGA failed to address Plaintiffs' June 18, 2020 comments and issued a

21 substantially similar final version of the report on the Transient Pool and Fallowing Program just

22 prior to the August 21, 2020 special IWVGA Board meeting.

23 237. Again, Plaintiffs, through their counsel, submitted comments on the Transient Pool

24 and Fallowing Program, along with comments on the Pumping Verification Report, on August

25 19, 2020. A true and correct copy of Plaintiffs' August 19, 2020 comment letter is attached hereto

26 as Exhibit K, and incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein. Again, the

27 IWVGA ignored Plaintiffs' comments. On August 20, 2020 and August 21, 2020 over Plaintiffs'

28 objections the IWVGA adopted the Pumping Verification Report and Transient Pool and

66 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 Fallowing Program, respectively.

2 238. The Pumping Verification Report and Transient Pool and Fallowing Program

3 suffer from numerous fatal flaws.

239. First, contrary to the Sustainable Yield Report's conclusion that "all pumping

5 [other than by de minimis and federal users] should be treated equally," the water users relegated

6 to the Transient Pool and Fallowing Program are not being treated equally. These users are being

7 given a meager one-time allocation sufficient for only a few years of continued production. At the

8 same time, the IWVGA's Replenishment Fee Ordinance grants permanent allocations to other

9 water users, including the Navy, the City of Ridgecrest, Kern County, Indian Wells Valley Water

10 District, Inyokern CSD, mutual water companies, and de minimis well owners that provide all or TT NOTNHOS #UHAVA LIVAH NIMISNMOXI 11 the majority of their current pumping needs on an annual basis. It is discriminatory to grant
UZ-IOIS6 VD BEqIEH E mOI puz taang edeoeuy 1201 12 permanent allocations to some water users, while agricultural producers in the Transient Pool and
Fallowing Program are granted one-time allotment sufficient for only a few years of continued 13

14 pumping. Accordingly, the Transient Pool and Fallowing Program makes decisions regarding the

15 priority of competing uses that have no basis in common law. The failure to treat water users

16 engaged in the cultivation of agriculture the same as other water users in the Basin violates

17 SGMA, lacks any rational basis, fails to respect common law water rights, and violates the

18 California Constitution.

19 240. Second, the Transient Pool and Fallowing Report and the underlying Pumping

20 Verification Report are deficient because each fails to justify Plaintiffs' exclusion. The Pumping

21 Verification Report entirely omits the pumping data submitted by Plaintiffs. Likewise, the

22 Transient Pool and Fallowing Program omits Plaintiffs from the program on the basis that

23 Plaintiffs "did not submit the required Pumping Verification Questionnaire." In fact, Plaintiffs,

24 through their counsel, submitted the Pumping Verification Questionnaire ("Questionnaire") to the

25 IWVGA and its consultants repeatedly throughout the spring and summer of 2020:

26 By letter dated May 26, 2020 Plaintiffs, through their counsel, provided notice to

27 the IWVGA and Stetson Engineers Inc. ("Stetson"), the IWVGA's Water

28 Resources Manager, that Mojave's answers to the Questionnaire would be

21886725.5

provided later that week, A true and correct copy of Plaintiffs' May 26, 2020 letter

2 is attached hereto as Exhibit L, and incorporated herein by reference as though

3 fully set forth herein.

4 By letter dated May 29, 2020 Plaintiffs, through their counsel, then submitted their

5 answers to the Questionnaire to the IWVGA and Stetson. Nonetheless, the draft

6 Pumping Verification Report issued by Stetson on June 3, 2020, which was

7 foundational to the Transient Pool and Fallowing Program, omitted Plaintiffs from

8 the Report. A true and correct copy of Plaintiffs' May 29, 2020 letter is attached

9 hereto as Exhibit M, and incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth

10 herein. BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 11 Upon discovering this error, Plaintiffs, through their counsel, sent a June 8, 2020
IT.LZ-I0IE6 VD UBQIEH EICES wop puz toans edroeuy IZOt 12 email to Joseph Montoya of Stetson in response to Mr. Montoya's invitation for

13 comment on the draft Pumping Verification Report. In the June 8, 2020 email,

14 Plaintiffs notified Mr. Montoya of the omission, provided Plaintiffs' two May

15 2020 letters including the answers to the Questionnaire, and asked for

16 confirmation that Plaintiffs would be included in the revised Pumping Verification

17 Report. A true and correct copy of Plaintiffs' June 8, 2020 email is attached hereto

18 as Exhibit N, and incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein.

19 Plaintiffs never received a response from Mr. Montoya, despite the fact that new

20 information submitted by other pumpers was rightfully incorporated into the

21 Pumping Verification Report in response to comments on the draft Report.

22 When the materials for the June 18, 2020 IWVGA Board meeting were released

23 Plaintiffs discovered that they had again been excluded from the Transient Pool

24 and Fallowing Program on the basis that Mojave "did not submit the required

25 Pumping Verification Questionnaire," despite Plaintiffs' three prior letters and

26 emails. Therefore, Plaintiffs clarified in their June 18, 2020 comment letter and

27 oral comments at the June 18 meeting that Plaintiffs had in fact submitted the

28 Questionnaire. (See, e.g., Exh. H at p. 7 ['The Transient Pool structure is also

68 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

deficient because it fails to justify Mojave's exclusion. The Report on the 1

Transient Pool and Fallowing Program wrongfully claims that [Plaintiffs]  did not 2

submit the required Pumping Verification Questionnaire.' In fact, the 3

+1 a questionnaire was submitted to the IWVGA and Stetson in May 2020.
Additiopally, the questionnaire was re-submitted to Stetson on June 8, 2020, upon
learning that [Plaintiffs] had been erroneously excluded from the Draft Pumping

7 Verification Report. We request that this immediately be remedied."].)
After receiving no substantive response to Plaintiffs' June 18, 2020 comments, 8

9 Plaintiffs, through their counsel, submitted second email on July 13, 2020, this

10 time addressed to Mr. Montoya and Steve Johnson of Stetson, the Clerk of the
IWVGA Board, and Jim Markman, one of the IWVGA's legal counsel. This email 11

again outlined the history detailed above and asked for confirmation that Plaintiffs 1oti paz yang ededeuy 1 TLZ-T0IS6 VO REqreg mueS d'TT NJAHHOS HARAVI LIVAH NIAISNMOHA 12

13 would be added to the Pumping Verification Report and Transient Pool and

14 Fallowing Program, now that the IWVGA and Stetson had the benefit of 1.5

15 months to incorporate the answers to Mojave's Questionnaire into the Transient

16 Pool Report. A true and A correct copy of Plaintiffs' July 13, 2020 email is attached
17 hereto as Exhibit O, and incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth

18 herein. Again, this email was met with silence.

19 Finally, Plaintiffs, through their counsel, recounted this history in their August 19,
2020 comment letter on the Pumping Verification Report and the adoption of the 20

21 Transient Pool and Fallowing Program and again asked to be included in the
Transient Pool and Fallowing Program. (Exh. K.) Again, the IWVGA denied this 22

In excluding Plaintiffs from both the Pumping Verification Report and Transient request. 23

24 241.

25 Pool and Fallowing Program, the IWVGA failed to identify a single policy, regulatory, or factual
26 circumstance of any kind to exclude the known data submitted by Plaintiffs from consideration.

27 Plaintiffs assert that the IWVGA's failure to acknowledge and account for known, actual water

FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR 28 use by a multi-million dollar going agricultural concern and excluding Plaintiffs from the

69 WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT
21886725.5

Pumping Verification Report and Transient Pool and Fallowing Report-when there was nearly

2 three months and multiple IWVGA public meetings to correct the situation-is arbitrary and
capricious.

4 242. Plaintiffs' exclusion from the Transient Pool and Fallowing Program also runs

5 contrary to the GSP, which provides: "All groundwater pumpers who were producing

6 groundwater during the Base Period and who are not given an Annual Pumping Allocation will be
eligible to receive a Transient Pool Allocation." (GSP at 5-6.) As acknowledged in the report on

8 the Transient Pool and Fallowing Program, Plaintiffs produced groundwater during the Base
Period defined as January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2014.

10 243. Plaintiffs assert that the IWVGA's decision to exclude Plaintiffs from the Pumping

11 Verification Report and ultimately from the Transient Pool and Fallowing Program amounts to an
J00Ld poz *y23n) edwwuy IZOI IT'NJNNHOS NHRAVA LIVAH NIMISNMOHA 1ILZ-IOIE6 VD ENqRA NUES 12 arbitrary multi-million dollar penalty. As modeled by the IWVGA prior to adoption of the GSP in

13 Model Scenario 6.2, Plaintiffs would have held 4,292 AF of the Transient Pool, which amounts to

14 a value in excess of $9 million dollars, based on the Replenishment Fee of $2,130 per AF. Even

15 a with a smaller Transient Pool than modeled under Scenario 6, the IWVGA's wrongful decision

16 constitutes the arbitrary adoption of a multi-million dollar penalty-or the deprivation of a multi-

17 million dollar property right---without due process.

18 244. The penalty is illegal because Plaintiffs were never provided with the requisite

19 notice. Specifically, the Questionnaire fails to notify the respondent that failure to submit the

20 Questionnaire on March 1, 2020 is grounds for exclusion from the Pumping Verification Report

21 and Transient Pool and Fallowing Program. In other words, the IWVGA failed to disclose to

22 Plaintiffs or any other pumper that the failure to respond by a certain date carried a forward

23 forfeiture of the right to participate in a program not yet formulated, let alone finalized. Without

24 the requisite notice, the IWVGA's multi-million dollar penalty on Plaintiffs violates basic

25 principles of due process that cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.

26 245. The IWVGA singled out Plaintiffs in refusing to accept Plaintiffs' June 8, 2020

27 comments on the draft Pumping Verification Report. This refusal is arbitrary because the
information from other pumpers in response to Stetson's June 3, 2020 28 IWVGA accepted new

70 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FORI WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 request for comment on the draft Pumping Verification Report. The IWVGA never contended

2 that the information submitted by Plaintiffs was incorrect. The IWVGA's disparate treatment of

3 Plaintiffs is arbitrary and capricious, violates constitutional due process protections, and is wholly

4 without evidentiary support of any kind.

5 246, The IWVGA further failed to comply with applicable law in adopting the

6 Transient Pool and Fallowing Program because it purports to condition participation in the

7 Transient Pool and Fallowing Program on "a release of any and all claims against the IWVGA

8 and its members on a form approved by counsel for the IWVGA." The condition is an

9 unconstitutional condition. (San Diego County Water Authority v. Metropolitan Water Dist. of
I'TT'YOTHOS NASAVA LIVAH NILISNMOHH 10 Southern California (2017) 12 Cal.App.5th 1124, 1159-60.)

11 247. Finally, as set forth in Section IX.I., the IWVGA failed to proceed in the manner
ITLZ-TOIS6 V. ERqRgI Joola puz *oang edeoruy 1Z01 12 required by law in adopting the Transient Pool and Fallowing Program without studying the

13 environmental impacts of the decision as required under CEQA. The Transient Pool and

14 Fallowing Program will have potentially significant environmental impacts associated with

15 widespread fallowing resulting from the IWVGA's strategic elimination of agriculture, including,

16 but not limited to, impacts on air quality, human health, greenhouse gas emissions, biological

17 resources, aesthetics, and local economies.

18 I. The IWVGA Failed to Proceed in the Manner Required by Law in Adopting
the Replenishment Fee on August 21, 2020 19

20 248. The Replenishment Fee is a SGMA fee adopted pursuant to Water Code section

21 10730.2, which requires compliance with specific Proposition 218 requirements.

22 249. As explained by the IWVGA's Director Gleason at a public forum on August 13,

23 2020 and as further discussed at the IWVGA's August 21, 2020 adoption hearing, the IWVGA

24 proposes to use the Replenishment Fee funds to purchase a water right entitlement. The IWVGA

25 hopes to then sell or lease those purchased rights to landowners outside the Basin until the

26 construction of extensive and costly infrastructure to bring the imported water into the Basin can

27 be financed, analyzed, and approved. Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that the IWVGA

28 has not yet even identified the source of that imported water or when it will be purchased, if ever.

71 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

250. The IWVGA first issued its Staff Report and Draft Engineer's Report on the

2 adoption of the $2,130 per AF Replenishment Fee in advance of its June 18, 2020 Board meeting.

3 The June 18, 2020 Staff Report on the Replenishment Fee explains that "De Minimis extractors
and Federal extractors are exempt from the Replenishment Fee, as well as those that have
permission to extract unused (inchoate) portions of the Navy's estimated Federal Reserve Water

6 Right Interest' -termed a "carryover" extraction--and entities pumping water pursuant to a

7 Transient Pool allotment.

8 251. On June 18, 2020, prior to the IWVGA Board meeting, Plaintiffs submitted,

9 through their counsel, comments on the proposed Replenishment Fee asking the IWVGA to

ITINDAHHOS #NHAVA LIVAH NIZISNMONH 10 correct several inadequacies in the fee proposal before mailing the Proposition 218 notices

11 required for adoption of the fee pursuant to Water Code section 10730.2 and the California
Santa Barbara, CA 93101-2711 Jool puz h04s ededery Izol 12 Constitution, Article XIII D, Section 6. (Exh. H.)

13 252. The IWVGA nevertheless proceeded to mail the Proposition 218 notice

14 (*'Proposition 218 Notice"). Plaintiffs are informed and believe and on that basis allege that the

15 IWVGA mailed the Proposition 218 notice to each property owner overlying the Basin as

16 reflected on the assessor's tax rolls for each county, rather than only the property owners subject

17 to the fee. A true and correct copy of the Proposition 218 Notice received by Plaintiffs is attached

18 hereto as Exhibit P, and incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein.

19 253. Plaintiffs timely submitted protests to the Replenishment Fee on August 10, 2020

20 and August 12, 2020, as well as comment letters regarding the Replenishment Fee's various

21 procedural and substantive inadequacies on August 6, 2020 and August 19, 2020. True and

22 correct copies of Plaintiffs' protests letters are attached hereto as Exhibits Q and R, and

23 incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein. True and correct copy of

24 Plaintiffs' August 6, 2020 and August 19, 2020 comment letters are attached hereto as Exhibit S

25 and Exhibit T, respectively, and incorporated herein by reference as though fully set forth herein.

26 254. IWVGA adopted the Replenishment Fee on August 21, 2020 over the objections

27 of Plaintiffs and the protests of thousands of property owners. The IWVGA, however, did not

28 disclose at the August 21, 2020 hearing how many protests it received.

72 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT
21886725.5

1 i. The Replenishment Fee is based on substantive legal deficiencies

2 255. The Replenishment Fee adopted by the IWVGA rests on a flawed theory that the

3 Navy's federal reserved water right can be "carried over" and utilized off the Navy base for non-

4 federal purposes. As stated in the Proposition 218 Notice, it is presumed that the Navy will supply

5 "residential 'carryover' water in accordance with the following chart which shows the current

6 estimated carryover." The chart included in the Proposition 218 Notice is reproduced below in

7 Figure 2.

256. Accordingly, the Replenishment Fee is based upon a scheme where certain non- 22

23 federal pumpers, "that have permission to extract unused portions of the Navy's estimated

24 Federal Reserve Water Right interest," are exempt from payment of the Replenishment Fee.

25 These non-federal parties will receive free water supplies at the expense of Plaintiffs and other

26 pumpers that are not exempt from the Replenishment Fee.

257. This scheme is unsupported in the law because the Navy's federal reserved water 27

28 right, whatever it is, cannot be transferred to non-federal entities. The right, whatever its quantity,

73 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT
21886725.5

1 is both appurtenant to and limited by the four corners of the federal reservation, here the Navy

2 base. By law, an inchoate federal reserved water right extends only to the federal land withdrawn

3 from the public domain and to the primary purpose of the federal reservation. (See, e.g., Cappaert

4 V. United States (1976) 426 U.S. 128, 138 ['This Court has long held that when the Federal

5 Government withdraws its land from the public domain and reserves it for a federal purpose, the

6 Government ... acquires a reserved right in unappropriated water which vests on the date of the

7 reservation . . . In determining whether there is a federally reserved water right implicit in a

8 federal reservation of public land, the issue is whether the Government intended to reserve
unappropriated and thus available water."]; Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians v. Coachella
BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARRER SCHRECK, LLP 10 Water Dist. (9th Cir. 2017) 849 F.3d 1262, 1268-69 [explaining that the Supreme Court has

11 emphasized that, under the doctrine of federal reserved water rights, the government reserves
FTLZ-IOIE6 VO 3 Jo0u1 puz yoang edeseuy 1Z01 12 "only 'that amount of water necessary to fulfill the purpose of the reservation, no more"* and that

13 the United States must "acquire water in the same manner as any other public or private

14 appropriator'" where "water is only valuable of a secondary use of the reservation'" (quoting

15 United States v. New Mexico (1978) 438 U.S. 696, 701, 702)].) As an inchoate right appurtenant

16 to specific land, for specifically designated federal purposes, it is not legally possible to "carry-

17 over," transfer, or assign federal reserved water right or to exclude others from pumping

18 groundwater that is not required by the Navy.

19 258. Likewise, in California, for a water right to be transferable, there must be both a

20 willing transferee and transferor and it must not cause injury to any legal user. (See, e.g., North

21 Kern Water Storage Dist. v. Kern Delta Water Dist. (2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 555, 559; Barton V.

22 Riverside Water Co. (1909) 155 Cal. 509, 517-518.) Where these criteria are met, paperwork

23 must be drawn up to effectuate the transfer. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and therefore
24 allege that none of these pre-requisites have been met.

25 259. The Replenishment Fee's "Navy carryover" scheme is also unsupported by the

26 facts. Whereas the Proposition 218 Notice states that the water users shown in the table above

27 (Figure 2) will be exempted from the fee "through Navy pronouncement," NAWS Commander

28 Benson expressly stated at the July 16, 2020 IWVGA Board meeting that the Navy "did not

74 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT
21886725.5

1 direct, ask or imply that the IWVGA should transfer" the Navy's water right to any third party. In

2 other words, the Navy denies that it has ever issued the "pronouncement" relied upon by the

3 IWVGA.

4 260. Further, the transfer or "carryover" of the Navy's federal reserved water right to

5 non-federal users violates the substantive requirements of Proposition 218 which requires, inter

6 alia, that "It]he amount of a fee or charge imposed upon any parcel or person as an incident of

7 property ownership shall not exceed the proportional cost of the service attributable to the

8 parcel." (Cal. Const., Art. XIII D, Sec. 6, subd. (b)(1)-(4).) The purported "transfer" of the

9 Navy's federal reserved water rights to certain groundwater users will allow those users to obtain
d'TI MOM8HOS MI8AVA LLVAH NILLSNMOHA 10 "free" water, while the remaining water users are being asked to subsidize the acquisition of a

11 water right entitlement funded by the fee. The Replenishment Fee therefore violates Proposition
TI.LZ-TOIE6 V: *RmOZa g WIIBS J00L1 puz qo7g edeseay IZOT 12 218's proportionality requirement where it will be selectively imposed on somebut not all-

13 will fund the acquisition of a water right entitlement that will benefit all users of water users, yet

14 groundwater.

15 261. The discussion in the Engineer's Report for the Replenishment Fee of the

16 IWVGA's assertions as to the Navy's alleged water rights and the IWVGA's legal interpretations

17 of SGMA provisions is also inappropriate because such matters are legal in nature, outside the

18 expertise of the engineers, and beyond the general purpose of the report.

19 262. Additionally, as set forth in Section IX.I., the IWVGA failed to proceed in the

20 manner required by law in adopting the Replenishment Fee without studying the environmental

21 impacts of the decision as required under CEQA. The Replenishment Fee will have potentially

22 significant environmental impacts associated with widespread fallowing resulting from the

23 IWVGA's strategic elimination of agriculture, including, but not limited to, impacts on air

24 quality, human health, greenhouse gas emissions, biological resources, aesthetics, and local

25 economies.

26 ii. The Replenishment Fee is was adopted through a procedure that did not comply with the requirements of Proposition 218 27

28

75 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT
21886725.5

1 263. Proposition 218 mandates that property-related fees, including the Replenishment

2 Fee, can only be adopted if certain procedures are followed. They include the following:

3 (1) a The parcels upon which a fee or charge is proposed for imposition shall be identified. The amount of the fee or charge proposed to be
4 imposed upon each parcel shall be calculated. The agency shall provide written notice by mail of the proposed fee or charge to the record owner of each identified parcel upon which the fee or charge is proposed for 5 imposition, the amount of the fee or charge proposed to be imposed upon each, the basis upon which the amount of the proposed fee or charge was 6 calculated, the reason for the fee or charge, together with the date, time,
7 and location of a public hearing on the proposed fee or charge. (2) The agency shall conduct a public hearing upon the proposed fee or charge not less than 45 days after mailing the notice of the proposed fee or charge to the record owners of each identified parcel upon which the fee or charge is proposed for imposition. At the public hearing, the agency shall consider all protests against the proposed fee or charge. If written protests against the proposed fee or charge are presented by a majority of J'TT XOTHHOS MARAVA LIVAH NIAISNMONH 10 owners of the identified parcels, the agency shall not impose the fee or charge. 11
10td puz twoans edeseuy IZDT (Cal. Const., Art. XIII D, Sec. 6, subd. (a).) 12
OIE6 VD RJEQIEg Eg 264. The Proposition 218 Notice specifies that a public hearing would be held at which
13 "the Board will consider and it may adopt the Replenishment Fee as provided, or at lower rate, if 14 less than a majority of landowners receiving this notice file written protests prior to the 15 conclusion of the public hearing" and that the "public hearing will be held on August 21, 2020, at 16
the hour of 10:00 a.m. in the Chambers of the City Council, 100 W. California Ave, Ridgecrest, 17
California . . .." However, the meeting held on August 21, 2020 was not open to the public at the 18
Chambers of the City Council, as stated in the Notice. Instead, the meeting was conducted via an
19
online "livestream,"2 and those wishing to make verbal public comments were directed to a phone 20
line that allowed only a few callers at a time, requiring the caller to call back repeatedly if a busy
21
tone was reached. Plaintiffs allege on information and belief that since March 2020, the IWVGA
22
was holding Board meetings online via livestream due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, at
23 the time the Proposition 218 Notice was sent out, IWVGA knew that the meeting would likely be 24 conducted via livestream. The IWVGA should have either provided the information to access the
25 livestream in the Notice, or the Notice should have directed the recipients to the IWVGA's 26
website to access that information. Instead, that information was not made available on the
27

28 Although the "livestream" options had either a 4-second or 22-second streaming delay.

76 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT
21886725.5

IWVGA's website until August 20, 2020, the day before the hearing. The confusion about where

2 or how the meeting would be conducted, and the artificial barrier to providing verbal comment by

3 requiring callers to hang up and hope they were able to call back at a moment when the line was

4 free, served to chill public comment, participation, and potential objections to adoption of the

5 Replenishment Fee in violation of Proposition 218. (Cal. Const., Art. XIII D, Sec. 6, subd. (a)(1).)

6 265. The Proposition 218 Notice goes on to require that "written protests MUST

7 include" a "[sligned original signature statement indicating that the writing is to be considered

8 a written protest on behalf of the parcel." (Emphasis added.) However, this requirement is not

g found within the law and serves as an illegitimate barrier to public protest and participation in the

d'TT'MOIHHOS ANNaVA LLVAH NIALSNMONg 10 Replenishment Fee adoption process. Nothing in the law prevents, nor would it be fair to prevent,

11 the submission of electronic protests. This is particularly true given the novel circumstances
100L puz 73ang edeoeuy t201 Santa Barbara, CA 93101-2711 12 surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. Even if the IWVGA could have properly required only

13 original signatures, at the very least the Proposition 218 Notice should have provided instructions

14 for in-person delivery of protests, given that protests could not be filed at the hearing as stated in

15 the notice. Instead, on August 19, 2020, a mere two days before the hearing, the IWVGA posted a

16 document on its website stating that there were two locations where the original signed protested

17 letters could be dropped off: via dropbox at the Indian Wells Valley Water District or at the

18 Ridgecrest Police Department within City Hall. The instructions provided by the IWVGA only

19 two days before the hearing state that "it is HIGHLY advisable that Protest letters be submitted

20 prior to the Friday hearing." The IWVGA's arbitrary requirement for original signatures, failure

21 to provide instructions for the submission of those signatures until a mere two days prior to the

22 hearing --as opposed to the 45 days required under Proposition 218-and the implication in the

23 IWVGA's instruction document that those wishing to submit protests had only one or two days to

24 arrange for the submission of those protests, assuming that they found their way to the

25 instructions which were not mentioned anywhere in the Proposition 218 Notice itself, served as a

26 barrier to the submission of protests in violation of Proposition 218. (Cal. Const., Art. XIII D,

27 Sec. 6, subd. (a).).

28

77 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 266. The Replenishment Fee Notice was deficient in a further respect. Plaintiffs allege

2 on information and belief that the Replenishment Fee Notice was mailed to all property owners

3 within the Basin. However, Proposition 218 mandates that notice be provided to "to the record

4 owners of each identified parcel upon which the fee or charge is proposed for imposition. At

5 the public hearing, the agency shall consider all protests against the proposed fee or charge. If

6 written protests against the proposed fee or charge are presented by a majority of owners of the

7 identified parcels, the agency shall not impose the fee or charge." (Cal. Const., Art. XIII D, Sec.

8 6, subd. (a)(2) [emphasis added].) To comply with the procedures of Proposition 218, IWVGA

9 should only have mailed the Replenishment Fee Notice to owners within the Basin who would be

ITTNOANHOS HZIAVA LIVAH NIZISNMOMA 10 subject to the Replenishment Fee. Because IWVGA provided the Notice to all property owners

11 within the Basin, even those who will not be subject to the Replenishment Fee under the federal
ITZZ-TOTSG V 'RBqIRE JoL puz qoons ededeuy IZOI 12 reserved water right carryover scheme described herein, the number of protests required to form a

13 "majority" has been impermissibly expanded by thousands of participants who have no basis

14 upon which to protest the fee, because they will not be subject to it. In effect, this illegal notice

15 process diluted the protest votes of property owners subject to the exorbitant Replenishment Fee.

16 The IWVGA's adoption of the Replenishment Fee on the basis that the "majority" of property

17 owners did not submit protests was therefore deeply flawed and did not comply with the

18 procedure required under the California Constitution. (Cal. Const., Art. XIII D, Sec. 6, subd. (a).)

19 267. The Proposition 218 Notice also failed to accurately describe the basis for the

20 amount of the fee proposed. (Cal. Const., Art. XIII D, Sec. 6, subd. (a)(1).) The Proposition 218

21 Notice states that the fee "will cover the estimated imported water purchase costs of $2,112 per

22 acre foot extracted and $17.50 per are foot extracted to cover the estimated costs to mitigate

23 damages to the IWVGA registered shallow wells because of the ongoing overdraft while import

24 supplies are secured and brought into the Basin" [emphasis added]. But the Notice also states that

25 "it is estimated to take five years to fund the purchase [of imported water] at which time the

26 charge will cease and the infrastructure construction phase will begin." The language in the notice

27 is therefore vague and conflicting. It is unclear if the $2,112 per AF component of the

28 Replenishment Fee will be charged until imported water is "brought into the Basin," or for

78 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 approximately five years until "infrastructure construction" begins. The timeline for the

2 completion of infrastructure construction, which will require substantial environmental review,

3 will undoubtedly take longer than five years.

4 268. This language also is flawed because it suggests that the Replenishment Fee will

5 fund efforts to bring water "into the Basin." Whereas, IWVGA Board members clarified at the

6 August 21, 2020 hearing that the Fee would be used only to fund the acquisition of a water right

7 entitlement and that separate funding would need to be secured for construction of the facilities

8 necessary to actually import water to the Basin.

269. In sum, the Proposition 218 Notice fails to answer numerous questions that are

d'TI YONNHOS HASAVA LIVAH NIALSNMONg 10 integral to property owners' understanding of the fee and their decision on whether to support it.

11 Those questions, inter alia, include:
ILZ-IOIS6 V. 1021 Anacapa 1ooLt puz saan 12 What is the purpose of the fee?

13 Will the fee fund both the purchase water rights and construction of infrastructure

14 to import water to the basin?

15 If the fee will not fund infrastructure construction, how will the import projects be

16 funded and who will pay?

17 What is the duration of the fee-i.e., for how long will the fee be imposed?

18 On which water users will the fee be imposed and how might this change over

19 time (e.g., if the Navy ramps up production)?

20 Why is this fee thousands of dollars more expensive on a per acre-foot basis than

21 any other post-GSP fee adopted or proposed by any GSA across the state?

22 270. Because the Proposition 218 Notice contained confusing and contradictory

23 language regarding the basis for the proposed fee, and did not provide property owners with

24 sufficient information upon which to base a decision to protest the fee, it failed to satisfy the

25 requirements of Article XIII D, Section 6 of the California Constitution.

26 271. Further, the Proposition 218 Notice does not accurately set forth the basis for the

27 IWVGA's decision to exempt certain water users, including "residents in IWVGA registered

28 small mutual and the Inyokern Community Services District." The Replenishment Fee Notice

79 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

states that these owners are exempted from the fee "though Navy pronouncement that its water

2 needs include off-Station demands for its workforce, and their dependents." Navy officials,
however, have directly contradicted this stated rationale. For example, at the July 16, 2020

4 meeting of the IWVGA Board, Navy Commander Benson explained:

5 The IWVGA alone made the decision to use the Navy's pumping data to estimate the federal reserved water right. Additionally, the 6 IWVGA made the allocation decisions to transfer the IWVGA
estimated federal reserved water right. The Navy didn't direct, or
7 ask, or apply that the IWVGA should transfer the estimated federal reserved water right balance. (Emphasis added.)

272. As such, the Proposition 218 Notice wrongly relied on a "Navy pronouncement"
as the basis for the federal reserved water right carryover scheme that is foundational to the
10 ITI NOTAHOS MNAMVA LLVAH NILISNMONA IWVGA's identification of the parcels on which the fee is proposed for imposition. The
11 Proposition 218 Notice was therefore defective and failed to identify the proposed basis for
which the fee was TLZ-LOIE6 VO ool paz pons edeseury 1207 12 imposition of the fee and to provide the explanation required by law upon
13 based. (Cal. Const., Art. XIII D, Sec. 6, subd. (a)(1).) Until the TWVGA rectifies the deficiencies 14 qques identified herein and recirculates the Proposition 218 Notice, the fee is illegal and unenforceable. 15
J. The IWVGA Failed to Proceed in the Manner Required by Law in Adopting the Reporting Policy. 16

17 273. On October 15, 2020, the IWVGA adopted Resolution No. 07-20 Establishing a

18 Reporting Policy for all New Groundwater Extraction Wells in the Basin (*Reporting Policy").
Resolution No. 07-20 is attached hereto as Exhibit U. It allows the IWVGA to regulate the
20 construction of "new groundwater extraction wells," defined to include "construction of new 19

21 wells, enlargement of existing wells and reactivation of abandoned wells," along with

22 construction of "replacement" wells.

23 274. Pursuant to Resolution No. 07-20 applicants must submit to the IWVGA "any and

24 all County well applications and/or well permit requests before commencing work on the new

25 groundwater extraction well." The IWVGA then reviews well permit applications to assess "the

26 potential of the new groundwater extraction well(s) to cause Material Injury to the Basin and/or to

27 other current Basin Producers." "Material Injury" is defined as "impacts to the Basin caused by

28 the pumping of groundwater that causes material physical harm to the Basin, any Subarea, or any

80 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT
21886725.5

Producer/Party, including, but not limited to, overdraft, degradation of water quality by

2 introduction of contaminants to the aquifer by a Party and/or transmission of those introduced
contaminants through the aquifer, liquefaction, land subsidence, and other material physical

4 injury caused by elevated or lowered groundwater levels. Material physical harm does not include

5 economic injury that results from other than direct physical causes, including any adverse effect

6 on water rates, lease rates, or demand for water. If fully mitigated, Material Injury shall no longer

7 be considered to be occurring." After IWVGA staff completes its review for "Material Injury" it

8 will then make a "recommendation to the Board and other interested regulators regarding the new

9 groundwater extraction well application/well permit request."

10 275. IWVGA's well reporting requirement and imposition of a material injury analysis BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLI 11 in the well permitting process is inappropriate and contrary to law.
TTAZ-TOEE6 VO Jool! puz eans ededeay IZOI 12 First, the IWVGA can hold well permitting authority only if it is delegated

13 such authority by the three counties (Kern, Inyo, and San Bernardino Counties) overlying

14 the Basin. (Water Code § 10726.4(b) ["This section does not authorize a groundwater

15 sustainability agency to issue permits for the construction, modification, or abandonment
16 of groundwater wells, except as authorized by a county with authority to issue those

17 permits."].) On information and belief, these counties have not delegated well permitting

18 authority to the IWVGA.

19 Second, Water Code section 10726.4(b) does not compel the Kern, Inyo, or

20 San Bernardino Counties to provide well permit applications to the IWVGA. It is

21 therefore inappropriate and contrary to SGMA to mandate that a well permit applicant

22 submit their application to the IWVGA when SGMA does not compel counties to do the

23 same. (Id. ["A groundwater sustainability agency [GSA] may request of the county, and

24 the county shall consider, that the county forward permit requests for the construction of

25 new groundwater wells, the enlarging of existing groundwater wells, and the reactivation

26 of abandoned groundwater wells to the groundwater sustainability agency before permit

27 approval."].)

28 Likewise, SGMA does not grant a GSA the authority to determine whether

81 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

"Material Injury" is occurring or require mitigation of "Material Injury,' as defined in

2 Resolution No. 07-20, as condition of well permit issuance.

3 276. Additionally, several aspects of Resolution No. 07-20 are arbitrary.

4 First, the definition of "Material Injury" is overly broad and does not

5 provide a valid standard by which the IWVGA could attempt to deny an application for a

6 groundwater well or influence a county to deny an application. For example, the definition

7 of "Material Injury" includes "overdraft," allowing the IWVGA to seek to deny

8 construction of all new wells or enlargement of existing wells on the basis that DWR has

9 designated the Basin as "subject to critical conditions of overdraft."

d'TT'NOTHHOS NAGHVA LIVAH NIAISNMONg 10 Second, the IWVGA's definition of "new groundwater extraction wells" is

11 overly broad and extends to "enlargement of existing wells," "reactivation of abandoned
J0014 puz *yans edeowuy 1Z0T Santa Barbara, CA 93101-2711 12 wells," and construction of a "replacement well."

13 Third, Resolution No. 07-20 does not address compliance with SGMA's

14 mandate that any actions to regulate, limit, or suspend extractions from groundwater wells

15 "shall be consistent with the applicable elements of the city or county general plan."

16 (Water Code § 10726.4(a)(2).)

17 277. Plaintiffs provided extensive comments on these issues in its June 18, 2020 and

18 October 15, 2020 letters, attached hereto as Exhibits H and V, respectively, which were ignored

19 by the IWVGA.

20 K. The IWVGA Failed to Proceed in the Manner Required by Law in Establishing the Recycled Water Program by Adopting Resolution No. 08-20 21 on December 17, 2020 and Entering into the Option Agreement

22
278. On November 19, 2020, the IWVGA adopted Resolution No. 08-20 Establishing a
23

24 Recycled Water Program ("Recycled Water Program"), attached hereto as Exhibit W, which was
adopted to implement Project No. 2 of the GSP to "Optimize Use of Recycled Water." The 25

26 Recycled Water Program involves the use of the City of Ridgecrest's wastewater treatment
facility to mitigate the need for imported water and reduce water costs for select participants of 27

28 the program (*Program Participants").

82 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT
21886725.5

279. Likewise, on November 19, 2020, the IWVGA approved entering into the Option

2 Agreement for the Purchase of Recycled Water from City of Ridgecrest ("Option Agreement"),
which among other things, excludes groundwater users engaged in the cultivation of agriculture

4 from receiving recycled water, limiting the use of recycled water for "municipal or industrial uses
either located within the City [of Ridgecrest] or for the direct benefit of the citizens of the City."

6 280. The Recycled Water Program and Option Agreement would allow Program
Participants to avoid payment of the Replenishment Fee for some undefined quantity of water per

8 Program Participant. Instead, Program Participants would be required to pay only $158.75/AF in

9 lieu of the full $2,130/AF Replenishment Fee.

281. d'TI'NOaaHOS BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER 10 In its October 15, 2020 and November 19, 2020 comment letters, which are

11 incorporated herein by reference, Plaintiffs objected to the creation and adoption of the Recycled

support under the law. TILZ-TOTE6 VO 'ereq7Rg O sooul puz ypong edeseuy IZoT 12 Water Program and Option Agreement as arbitrary and without

13 282. First, the Recycled Water Program and the Option Agreement arbitrarily exclude

14 Plaintiffs and other agricultural users from participation without support. By allowing select

15 Program Participants--but not Plaintiffs--to avoid paying the full Replenishment Fee, the

16 IWVGA has illegally picked winners and losers in violation of SGMA, the California and United

17 States Constitutions, and common law water rights principles.

18 283. Morcover, as demonstrated in the IWVGA's budget released in December 2020,

19 the Replenishment Fee would be used to fund the Recycled Water Program in the amount of

20 approximately $250,000 per year. This is problematic because Plaintiffs are required to pay the

21 Replenishment Fee but are entirely excluded from participating in the Recycled Water Program.

22 In other words, Plaintiffs would be required to fund a program from which they were excluded,

23 the sole purpose of which is to benefit other water users. This scheme is contrary to law because

24 it enforces the collection of a fee from non-program participants in violation of the California

25 Constitution. (See, e.g., Cal. Const., Art. XIII D, Sec. 6, subd. (b)(3).)

26 284. Further, the IWVGA's adoption of the Recycled Water Program and approval of

27 the Option Agreement failed to comply with CEQA because the IWVGA did not analyze the

28 environmental impacts of these actions prior to their adoption, claiming instead that the actions

83 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT
21886725.5

were exempt from CEQA because they concerned "design feasibility." Contrary to the IWVGA's

2 contention, CEQA was triggered because the IWVGA failed to retain sufficient discretion to

3 adopt an alternative, impose mitigation measures, or disapprove the project together, once CEQA
review is completed. (See Save Tara v. City of West Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116.)

5 285. Finally, the IWVGA failed to respond to Mojave's comments demonstrating that

6 several components of the Recycled Water Program should be further defined prior to adoption.

7 286. The IWVGA ignored Mojave's comments, adopting the Recycled Water Program

8 and Option Agreement over the objections of Plaintiffs and other stakeholders.

L. The IWVGA Failed to Proceed in the Manner Required by Law in Adopting the Implementing Actions and Recycled Water Program, and Option Agreement without Compliance with CEQA d'TT'YOTIHOS HNTHVA LIVAH NFALSNAOHA 10

11
287. Although adoption of the GSP itself is exempt from CEQA, SGMA expressly ITLZ-LOIE6 VO ERqRg wop puz yoons edeoeay IZ0t 12 provides that actions implementing a GSP are subject to CEQA. (Wat. Code, § 10728.6
13 ['Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code does not apply to
shall be 14 the preparation and adoption of plans pursuant to this chapter. Nothing in this part 15 interpreted as exempting from Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public
16 Resources a Code a project that would implement actions taken pursuant to a plan adopted pursuant 17
to this chapter."].)
18
288. Plaintiffs, through their counsel, submitted six comment letters to the IWVGA
19

20 notifying the agency of its obligation to conduct CEQA review of the GSP Implementing Actions
and Recycled Water Program, and Option Agreement. (Exhs. B, E, H, I, K, X.) 21
289. IWVGA staff expressly acknowledged that implementation of the GSP would lead
22 farmers to cease production. For example, at the June 18, 2020 IWVGA Board meeting, IWVGA
23 staff and decision-makers acknowledged that the collective result of the GSP Implementing
24 Actions proposed by the Board will result in agricultural producers leaving the Indian Wells
25 Valley en masse. For example, IWVGA Counsel Phillip Hall explained: 26 As we've mentioned earlier, we don't think Ag can absorb the cost
27 of imported water, especially based on what's going on in the State of California with SGMA in this basin. If they can great, but we've 28 had to make our best guess and we don't think they will be in the

84 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 permanency in buying augmented supplies.

2 290. Likewise, Mr. Steve Johnson explained that the Transient Pool is expected to

3 extend the life of overlying agricultural operations for only a few years:

got came 4 I'll be honest with you, one of the recommendations we
5 right from Chairman Gleason was, does it really make sense when you're looking at the Ag folks to ramp them down on the pumping
vO because as you ramp them down they're not gonna have enough water to operate their agricultural operations. So you're basically
7 slowly strangling them by ramping them down on the water supply. And the suggestion was that the same amount of water, why don't 8 we just totalize that during the ramp down period and create a pool,
9 give it to the agricultural pumpers, and as we give it to the pumpers, let them choose how many acres they want to operate, how they want to use that water and they can use it anyway they want. So BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 10 they can use the water up, farming all of their acreage for three to
11 four years or they could cut back a little bit and do it for five to six
ITLZ-IOIE6 VO 'EIQEE HLES wot pur *paus edeceuy 1Z0I years. Basically, give them the choice to use that allocation, 12 allotment should say, to use that pool water anyway they choose.
13 291. Notwithstanding this acknowledgment and Plaintiffs' prior comments, the

14 IWVGA Board failed evaluate the numerous potentially significant environmental impacts

15 associated with fallowing thousands of acres of agricultural land- an outcome that IWVGA staff
16 admitted is not speculative.

17 292. The Implementing Actions are group of connected actions to implement the GSP

18 over which the IWVGA has discretionary decision-making authority and that, collectively, will

19 have potentially significant environmental impacts that must be analyzed prior to adoption. Each

20 one of the Implementing Actions is individually subject to CEQA and must also be analyzed
21 together with each interrelated action. (Wat. Code, § 10728.6 [*a project that would implement

22 actions taken a pursuant to a [GSP]" is subject to CEQA]; 14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15378(a) [under

23 CEQA, "project" is defined as "the whole of an action" that has "a potential for resulting" in a
24 direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change to the environment].) Failure to analyze
25 each of the interrelated Implementing Actions together constitutes segmentation, which is

26 prohibited under CEQA.
27 293. The IWVGA wrongly claims that CEQA analysis is unnecessary because each of
28 the Implementing Actions are exempt from CEQA because they are ministerial actions or because

85 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT
21886725.5

1 they are otherwise statutorily or categorically excluded from CEQA.

2 294. The Implementing Actions are not, as the IWVGA claims, ministerial projects

3 because these decisions do not simply require conformance with a fixed standard or objective
4 measurements. Rather, they require exercise of personal judgment by the IWVGA Board as to the

5 wisdom and manner of carrying out the interrelated projects. There is nothing in SGMA that

6 requires the IWVGA to implement any one of these decisions in the manner proposed and

7 adopted by the IWVGA.

8 295. As documented in Plaintiffs' comment letters sent to the IWVGA and as

9 recognized in the GSP, the climate of the Indian Wells Valley is harsh, with winds that create dust

BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARRER SCHRECK, LLP 10 problems for the whole Valley, grounding planes and endangering the health of residents. (See,

11 e.g., GSP at p. 3-11 [Indian Wells Valley has an "arid, high desert climate characterized by hot
TTLZ-TOTE6 YD 'enqnegr J0oLI puz 7aoug edeseuy 1ZOl 12 summers, cold winters, and irregular and sparse precipitation" as well as "high winds"].)

13 296. Fallowing of Plaintiffs' farming operations, alone, would result in the death of

14 approximately 215,000 living pistachios trees and create dust and other environmental impacts

15 that would potentially take years and hundreds of thousands of dollars to mitigate. Yet Plaintiffs'

16 operations represent only a fraction of the agricultural production in the Indian Wells Valley-

17 there are many thousands of additional acres that farmers will be forced to leave vacant due to the

18 IWVGA's actions.

19 297. There is widespread acceptance that fallowing of agricultural lands, particularly in

20 arid environments such as the Indian Wells Valley, creates the potential for significant

21 environmental impacts, including impacts on air quality, human health, greenhouse gas (GHG)

22 emissions, biological resources, aesthetics, and local economies. Among other things, these

23 studies document that:

24 Fallowing of agricultural land causes measurable soil loss in quantities sufficient

25 to degrade air quality. (See, e.g., B.S. Sharratt, "Fugitive dust from agricultural

26 land affecting air quality within the Columbia Plateau, USA," 116 WIT

27 Transactions on Ecology and the Environment 281 (2008); see also Imperial

28 Irrigation District Water Conservation and Transfer Project FEIR/EIS

86 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 [acknowledging potentially significant impacts associated with fugitive dust and

2 PM10 emissions from fallowing].)

3 During wind events, such as those experienced in the Indian Wells Valley, even

4 very small amounts of soil loss caused by fallowing can lead to exceedances of

5 particulate matter (PM10) concentrations above standards imposed by regulatory

6 agencies. (See id.)

7 There are numerous health effects of particulate matter emissions, such as those

8 caused by fallowing, including premature death in people with heart or lung

9 disease, nonfatal heart attacks, irregular heartbeat, aggravated asthma, decreased

BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 10 lung function, and increased respiratory symptoms, such as irritation of the

11 airways, coughing, or difficulty breathing. (U.S. EPA, "Health and Environmental
1LZ-TOTS6 VO ZIQIEH' J0oLl puz 1ans edeseuy Izol 12 Effects of Particulate Matter (PM);" J.O. Anderson, "Clearing the air: a review of

13 the effects of particulate matter air pollution on human health," 8 Journal of 8

14 Medical Toxicology 166 (2012); IARC Monographs, Outdoor Air Pollution

15 (Volume 109) (2015).)

16 Fallowing agricultural lands creates the potential for increased pesticide and

17 herbicide use to control weeds on fallowed lands. (See Imperial Irrigation District

18 Water Conservation and Transfer Project Final Environmental Impact Report

19 ("EIR")/Environmental Impact Statement ("EIS").) In turn, increased pesticide and

20 herbicide use has the potential for significant impacts on biological resources, such

21 as native plant communities and wildlife, and water quality.

22 Fallowing of agricultural land has the potential to result in the loss of carbon

23 dioxide sequestering capacity if fallowed lands are not properly retired and soil

24 conservation techniques are not utilized. (See Imperial Irrigation District Water

25 Conservation and Transfer Project FEIR/EIS.)

26 Fallowing agricultural lands creates the potential for aesthetic impacts associated

27 with the loss of farmlands. (Cf. S.M. Swinton, et al. "Ecosystem services and

28 agriculture: cultivating agricultural ecosystems for diverse benefits," 64 Ecological

87 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT
21886725.5

Economics 245 (2007) [acknowledging that agriculture provides aesthetic

2 ecosystem services]; B.T. Van Zanten, et al. "A comparative approach to assess

3 the contribution of landscape features to aesthetic and recreational values in

4 agricultural landscapes," 17 Ecosystem Services 87 (2016).)

5 Fallowing lands used for the cultivation of agriculture creates regional economic

6 impacts. For example, a recent economic analysis of California's 2014 drought

7 found that the fallowing of approximately 410,000 acres of agricultural land in the

8 Central Valley, in 2014 alone, resulted in the loss of an estimated 6,722 direct jobs

9 and 15,183 indirect jobs and the loss in $800 million in lost economic output. (R.

10

11 Agriculture," Center for Watershed Sciences, U.C. Davis (July 2014).) Other
10OT puz yaons edeoeuy IZ0I I'TT'YOTHHOS TATAVA LIYXH NIHISNMONS Howitt, et al., "Economic Analysis of the 2014 Drought for California

RIEqRA BURS A 93101-2711 12 economic impacts include reduced tax revenues associated with the loss of

13 opportunity for economic utilization of properties currently used for crop

14 production.

15 The environmental and economic impacts associated with permanent fallowing of

16 agricultural lands also raise environmental justice concerns related to increased

17 environmental and economic impacts on rural and disadvantaged communities.

18 (See, e.g., K.D. Harris, "Environmental Justice at the Local and Regional Level

19 Legal Background," State of California Department of Justice (2012).)

20 298. Mitigation measures, including the long-term rehabilitation of native plants, will

21 be required to address the environmental impacts caused by fallowing. The environmental

22 impacts of these mitigation measures must be studied. For example, the re-establishment of native

23 plants will require water use, which must be analyzed. Mitigation will also be costly and will

24 require potentially lengthy commitments from local and state agencies. A mitigation cost analysis

25 should therefore also have been undertaken and the responsible party for each mitigation measure

26 should have been identified in the required CEQA analysis.

27 299. Likewise, in addition to the environmental and associated economic impacts

28 identified above, the Implementing Actions also create the potential for significant land use

88 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

•1 effects, including conflicts with Kern County land use policies, such as those that promote

2 agriculture. IWVGA was therefore required to prepare a land use analysis that examines conflicts

3 with existing policies and the potential for future zoning changes necessitated by the IWVGA's

4 Implementing Actions.

5 300. Not surprisingly, given the environmental and related economic impacts associated

6 with fallowing outlined above, there are various examples of EIRs that have concluded that

7 fallowing of agricultural land will cause potentially significant impacts, including the Imperial

8 Irrigation District Water Conservation and Transfer Project EIR/EIS, cited above.

9 301. Similarly, here, the IWVGA should have prepared an Initial Study and/or EIR

I'TT'YJNAHOS #IGHVA LIVAH NILSNMOHH 10 given the potentially significant environmental impacts of the Implementing Actions, including

11 those related to fallowing, and should have adopted mitigation measures to mitigate all significant
10Lr puz yoang edeseay 1Z01 Santa Barbara, CA 93101-2711 12 impacts associated with the Implementing Actions.

13 302. Additionally, for the reasons set forth in Section IX.K., above, the IWVGA should

14 have prepared an Initial Study and/or EIR prior to adoption of the Recycled Water Program and

15 approval of the Option Agreement.

16 303. Plaintiffs have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

17 21167.5 by mailing a written notice of commencement of this action to the IWVGA prior to the
18 commencement of this suit, a true and correct copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit Y.

23 304. Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and all of the preceding

24 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

25 305. The GSP was adopted by the IWVGA on January 16, 2020, as Resolution 01-20,

26 Adoption of the Groundwater Sustainability Plan for the Indian Wells Valley Groundwater Basin.

27 On or about March 13, 2020, Plaintiffs and the IWVGA entered into that certain Agreement to

Groundwater Basin Groundwater Sustainability Plan ("First Tolling Agreement"), which tolled

2 "any and all applicable statutes of limitation, without exception, regarding any claims that may be

3 asserted by a Party to this Agreement (whether by petition or complaint) arising from the
[IWVGA's] adoption and/or implementation of the GSP.. 23 for the period March 13, 2020 4

5 "until the earlier of: (i) seven (7) calendar days from the date at which the [IWVGA] formally

6 adopts the Transient Pool and Fallowing Program (as defined within the GSP), or (ii) June 30,

7 2020." On or about June 18, 2020, Plaintiffs and the IWVGA entered into that certain second

8 Agreement to Toll the Statute of Limitations Regarding Potential Challenges to the Indian Wells

9 Valley Groundwater Basin Sustainability Plan ("Second Tolling Agreement"), wherein the parties
BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLI 10 agreed to "toll and extend the applicable statute of limitations for each Party to file any Claims

11 (regardless of the cause of action, remedy and the judicial or administrative tribunal) that arise
ITAZ-E 3o01u puz *aon5 edeoeay t201 12 from the adoption and/or implementation of the GSP including any and all actions expressly or

15 Tolling Agreements effectively tolled any and all applicable statutes of limitations for the period

16 March 13, 2020 through September 30, 2020.

17 307. As a Basin groundwater user subject to the GSP, Plaintiffs have a beneficial

18 interest and right in the enforcement of the legal duties required of IWVGA under SGMA,

19 DWR's SGMA Regulations, the California Constitution, and all other applicable laws.

20 308. By adopting the GSP, the IWVGA has a legal duty to protect Plaintiffs' water

21 rights pursuant to the California Constitution and SGMA.

22 309. Plaintiffs allege that the IWVGA's adoption of the GSP was arbitrary and

23 capricious, and thus prejudicial abuse of discretion, and that the IWVGA failed to proceed in

24 the manner required by law, where the decision-makers had already determined, prior to the

25 adoption of the GSP, that the primary goal in managing the Basin would be the protection of the

26 Navy, and where such objective expressly conflicts with the stated legislative purpose of SGMA

27 to provide for sustainable groundwater management of groundwater basins.

28

90 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT
21886725.5

1 310. Plaintiffs allege that the IWVGA's adoption of the GSP was arbitrary and

2 capricious and lacking in evidentiary support, and so constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion,

3 where the evidence generated by the IWVGA during development of the GSP indicated that the

4 most severe pumping depression in the Basin has been identified near Navy production wells, and

5 whereas water levels at properties owned by other pumpers are already operating at the GSP's

6 measurable objective.

7 311. Plaintiffs allege that the IWVGA prejudicially abused its discretion, employed

8 unfair procedures, and failed to proceed in the manner required by law by adopting an inadequate

9 GSP which fails to adequately consider the interests of and impacts to all overlying uses and uses

10 of groundwater, including Plaintiffs, and by failing to adequately respond to their comments on
the GSP. (Wat. Code, §§ 10732.2, 10727.8(a); 23 Cal. Code Regs., §§ 354.10, 355.2(e)(3),

CA 93101-2711 12 355.4(b)(4), (10).)

13 312. Plaintiffs allege that the IWVGA prejudicially abused its discretion, employed

14 unfair procedures, and failed to proceed in the manner required by law by adopting an inadequate

15 GSP which fails to adequately consider the interests of all beneficial users, including Plaintiffs.

16 313. Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and on that basis allege that the IWVGA acted

17 in a manner that employed unfair procedures, was arbitrary and capricious and thus a prejudicial

18 abuse of discretion, and failed to proceed in the manner required by law in adopting the GSP

19 where it was based on a sustainable yield that was developed using a biased, undisclosed model

20 that violates SGMA's open public participation process and Plaintiffs' water rights.

21 314. Plaintiffs allege that the IWVGA acted arbitrarily and capriciously, employed

22 unfair procedures, prejudicially abused its discretion, and failed to proceed in the manner required

23 by law in adopting the GSP which declares that irrigation for agricultural purposes is not a

24 reasonable use of water, in express conflict with Water Code section 106 and Plaintiffs' lawful

25 right to use their property for agricultural purposes.

26 315. Plaintiffs allege that the IWVGA acted arbitrarily and capriciously, employed

27 unfair procedures, prejudicially abused its discretion, and failed to proceed in the in the manner

28 required by law in adopting the GSP which purports to determine or alter water rights, including

91 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR

21886725.5

violation of SGMA (Wat. Code, §§ 10720.5(b), 10720.1(b), 10726.8(b)) and Plaintiffs' in express

2 established precedent.

3 316. Plaintiffs allege that the IWVGA acted arbitrarily and capriciously, employed
unfair procedures, prejudicially abused its discretion, and failed to proceed in the manner required

5 the GSP which deviates from DWR's GSP Best Management Practices and by law adopting

6 Guidance Documents.

7 317. Plaintiffs allege that the IWVGA acted arbitrarily and capriciously, employed

8 unfair procedures, prejudicially abused its discretion, and failed to proceed in the manner required

9 by law in adopting the GSP containing management activities, specifically the Annual Pumping

10 Allocation and the Transient Pool and Fallowing Program, which are arbitrary and capricious and

11 lacking in evidence.
TILZ-TOTE6 Y ETBQROE EOTTES wora puz tons edeswury izot I'TI XOINHOS MZENVA LIVAH NILSNMONA 12 318. Accordingly, the IWVGA acted arbitrarily and capriciously, employed unfair

13 procedures, prejudicially abused its discretion, and failed to proceed in the manner required by

14 law in adopting the GSP.

15 319. Under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1085, mandamus can compel public

16 officials to perform an official act required by law. Mandamus may issue to compel an official

17 both to exercise discretion (if required by law to do so) and to exercise such discretion under

18 applicable law. Section 1085 authorizes this court to issue a writ of mandate "to compel the
19 performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins."

20 320. Plaintiffs ask this court for a writ of mandate or peremptory writ to compel

21 IWVGA to perform their legal duties to adopt a GSP which complies with all applicable laws.

22 321. Plaintiffs allege that unless enjoined and restrained by this Court, the IWVGA will

23 continue to impose its arbitrary and illegal GSP on Plaintiffs and upon other Basin users in

24 violation of SGMA and the United States and California Constitutions.

25 322. Plaintiffs and other Basin users subject to the GSP will suffer irreparable harm as a

26 result of the IWVGA's continued maintenance, application and implementation of the

27 unconstitutional GSP.

28

21886725.5

323. Plaintiffs have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy of law with respect to the

2 IWVGA's unlawful policies and interpretations or its related patterns and practices.

324. Plaintiffs accordingly seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief prohibiting

4 IWVGA from continuing to implement or apply its newly adopted GSP.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 5

6 (Writ of Mandate for Violation of SGMA and the California Constitution in Adopting the

7 Extraction Fee, Code of Civil Procedure, § 1085)

8 (All Plaintiffs Against Defendants IWVGA, IWVGA Board, and Does 1-100)

325. Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and all of the preceding

10 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

11 326. As a Basin groundwater user subject to the GSP and Extraction Fee, Plaintiffs
DOLl puz 700.4g edeogay 17 'TT*XOIHHOS HNHAVA LIVAH NIZISNMONI ILZ-IOTEG VO EIEQIg qUES 12 have a beneficial interest and right in the enforcement of the legal duties required of IWVGA

13 under both SGMA and the California Constitution, and all other applicable laws.

14 '327. SGMA clearly delineates the procedures that must be followed to fund different

15 budget items. Prior to adopting GSP, the IWVGA was only authorized to adopt fees under

16 Water Code section 10730. Following adoption of its GSP, however, the IWVGA gained the

17 supplemental authority to adopt fees under Water Code section 10730.2 which allows GSAs to

18 adopt fees to fund a broader variety of costs, including projects and management actions such as

19 the "[a]cquisition of lands or other property, facilities, and services," the "[s]upply, production,

20 treatment, or distribution of water," and "[o]ther activities necessary or convenient to implement

21 the plan." (Wat. Code, § 10730.2(a).)

22 328. The IWVGA stated that it adopted its Extraction Fee pursuant to the authority in

23 Water Code section 10730. Fees adopted under Water Code section 10730, however, can only be

24 used to pay for the costs of a groundwater sustainability program, including but not limited to,

25 preparation, adoption, and amendment of a GSP, and investigations, inspections, compliance

26 assistance, enforcement, and program administration, including a prudent reserve.

27 329. Under Proposition 26, the Extraction Fee is a tax requiring supermajority voter

28 approval unless the IWVGA is able to prove, by a preponderance of evidence, that (1) the

93 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

necessary to cover the reasonable Extraction Fee is not a tax, (2) that the amount is no more than

2 costs relating to the GSP or regulation, and (3) that the manner in which those costs are allocated

3 to a payor bear a fair or reasonable relationship to the payor's burdens on, or benefits received

4 from, the GSP activities.

5 330. The IWVGA has not met this burden. Therefore, the Extraction Fee is a tax that

6 has been imposed in violation of the California Constitution and without voter approval. As such,

7 the IWVGA employed unfair procedures, prejudicially abused its discretion, and failed to proceed

8 in the manner required by law in adopting the Extraction Fee.

9 331. Further, Plaintiffs allege that the budget for the adopted Extraction Fee includes

BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLI 10 improper budget items which constitute projects and management actions in the GSP. These

11 budget items can only be funded through a legally adopted fee that complies with the substantive
ILZZ-E0IE6 VD' zowa puz toang edeowy 120T 12 and procedural requirements set forth in Water Code section 10730.2.

13 332. Plaintiffs allege those improper budget items include, but are not limited to:

I eques 14 "Stetson - Imported Water Coordination for GSP;"

15 "Stetson • Allocation Process Development;"

16 "Stetson - Pumping Verification;"

17 "Stetson - Sustainable Yield Report;"

18 "Stetson - Fallowing Program Development;"

19 "Stetson - Water Importation Marketing Analysis for GSP;"
are related to GSP 20 Any other "Additional Tasks," to the extent these costs

21 implementation;

22 "Legal Costs," to the extent these costs are to defend challenges to the GSP

23 implementation actions;

24 "TWVGA Support Costs," to the extent these costs are related to GSP

25 implementation; and

26 "IWVGA Administrative Costs," to the extent these costs are related to

27 GSP implementation.

28

94 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT
21886725.5

1 333. Because the budget items listed in the above paragraph reflect projects and

2 management actions, IWVGA was required to follow the procedures described in Water Code
section 10730.2 to adopt a lawful Extraction Fee.

334. Specifically, fees adopted pursuant to Water Code section 10730.2 "shall be

5 adopted in accordance with subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 6 of Article XIII D of the

6 California Constitution." (Wat. Code, § 10730.2(c).)

7 335. Pursuant to Water Code section 10730.2, therefore, IWVGA had a clear duty to
comply with the requirements of Section 6 of Article XIII D of the California Constitution before

9 imposing the Extraction Fee.

10 336. Plaintiffs allege that IWVGA has failed to proceed in the manner required by law, A'TI'NONNHOS HIAHVA LIVAH NIALSNMOJg 11 specifically the requirements set forth in subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 6 of Article XIII D of 2014 puz *pons edeoeuy IZOI LTLZ-TOTS6 VO "wueg ueS 12 the California Constitution, and thus acted arbitrarily and capriciously and prejudicially abused its

13 discretion, in adopting the Extraction Fee.

14 337. Further, even if the budget items described herein were found to be authorized

15 under Water Code 10730, Plaintiffs allege that IWVGA has failed to demonstrate that the

16 Extraction Fee satisfies the Proposition 26 and 218 requirements to adopt a fee or special tax.

17 (See Cal. Const. Art. XIII C, sec. 1. subd. (e)(7) [specifying, inter alia, that "local government

18 bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that a levy, charge, or other

19 exaction is not a tax"].)

20 338. Plaintiffs allege that the IWVGA acted unreasonably and failed to proceed in the

21 manner required by law by failing to meet its obligation to provide Plaintiffs and others with

22 sufficient documentation associated with each budget item in order to assess whether the

23 proposed fee increase complies with SGMA.

24 339. Plaintiffs allege that the IWVGA employed unfair procedures and failed to

25 proceed in the manner required by law in failing to adopt findings that address the applicability of

26 the California Constitutional requirements for the imposition of fees.

27 340. Plaintiffs allege that the IWVGA acted arbitrarily and capriciously and thus

28 prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law in adopting

95 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

the Extraction Fee which is based on the illegally adopted Sustainable Yield Report, which grants

2 the Basin's entire sustainable yield to the Navy.

3 341. Plaintiffs allege that the IWVGA acted arbitrarily and capriciously, prejudicially
abused its discretion, and failed to proceed in the manner required by law in adopting the

5 Extraction Fee which fails to specify which groundwater users will be subject to the fee.

6 342. Accordingly, the IWVGA acted arbitrarily and capriciously, employed unfair

7 procedures, prejudicially abused its discretion, and failed to proceed in the manner required by

8 law in adopting the Extraction Fee.

343. Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, mandamus can compel public

10 officials to perform an official act required by law. Mandamus may issue to compel an official ITT NONHOS MEHVA LIVAH NIMISNMONH 11 both to exercise discretion (if required by law to do so) and to exercise such discretion under
TL7-I0186 VO ERQREgE jooLI puz yoanS edreuy 1Z0l 12 applicable law. Section 1085 authorizes this court to issue a writ of mandate "to compel the

13 performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins."

14 344. Plaintiffs petition this court for a writ of mandate or peremptory writ to compel

15 IWVGA to perform their legal duties to comply with the California Constitution and all

16 applicable laws in adopting a legally-compliant extraction fee, and to enjoin or otherwise prevent

17 the implementation of the Extraction Fee as currently adopted.

18 345. Plaintiffs further seek, an order, under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085,

19 invalidating the Extraction Fee and refunding any sums paid thereunder.

20 346. Plaintiffs allege that unless enjoined and restrained by this Court, IWVGA will

other Basin users 21 continue to impose its arbitrary and illegal Extraction Fee on Plaintiffs and upon

22 in violation of SGMA and the California Constitution.

23 347. Plaintiffs and other Basin users subject to the Extraction Fee will suffer irreparable

24 harm as a result of the IWVGA's continued maintenance, application and implementation of the

25 unconstitutional Extraction Fee.

26 348. Plaintiffs have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy of law with respect to the

27 IWVGA's unlawful policies and interpretations or its related patterns and practices.

28 349. Plaintiffs accordingly seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief prohibiting

5 (All Plaintiffs Against Defendants IWVGA, IWVGA Board, and Does 1-100)

6 350. Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and all of the preceding

7 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

8 351. As a Basin groundwater user subject to the GSP and Readopted Extraction Fee,

9 Plaintiffs have a beneficial interest and right in the enforcement of the legal duties required of

10 IWVGA under both SGMA and the California Constitution, and all other applicable laws. TI NOTHHOS ANIHVA LILVAH NILLSNMONH 11 352. SGMA clearly delineates the procedures that must be followed to fund different
A 93101-2711 Jo0p/ puz 7001g rdeseuy 1Z01 12 budget items. Prior to adopting GSP, the IWVGA was only authorized to adopt fees under

17 treatment, or distribution of water," and "[o]ther activities necessary or convenient to implement

18 the plan." (Wat. Code, § 10730.2(a).)

19 353. The IWVGA stated that it adopted the Readopted Extraction Fee on December 17,

20 2020 pursuant to the authority in Water Code section 10730. Fees adopted under Water Code

21 section 10730, however, can only be used to pay for the costs of a groundwater sustainability

22 program, including but not limited to, preparation, adoption, and amendment of a GSP, and

23 investigations, inspections, compliance assistance, enforcement, and program administration,

24 including a prudent reserve.

25 354. Under Proposition 26, the Readopted Extraction Fee is a tax requiring

26 supermajority voter approval unless the IWVGA is able to prove, by a preponderance of

27 evidence, that (1) the Readopted Extraction Fee is not a tax, (2) that the amount is no more than

28 necessary to cover the reasonable costs relating to the GSP or regulation, and (3) that the manner

97 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR

1 in which those costs are allocated to a payor bear a fair or reasonable relationship to the payor's

2 burdens on, or benefits received from, the GSP activities.

3 355. The IWVGA has not met this burden. Therefore, the Readopted Extraction Fee is a

4 tax that has been imposed in violation of the California Constitution and without voter approval.

5 As such, the IWVGA employed unfair procedures, prejudicially abused its discretion, and failed

6 to proceed in the manner required by law in adopting the Readopted Extraction Fee.

7 356. Further, Plaintiffs allege that the budget for the Readopted Extraction Fee includes

8 improper budget items which constitute projects and management actions in the GSP. These

9 budget items can only be funded through a legally adopted fee that complies with the substantive
'TI XYAHHOS ASEHVA LIVAH NILISNMONA 10 and procedural requirements set forth in Water Code section 10730.2.

22 "IWVGA Support Costs," to the extent these costs are related to GSP

23 implementation; and
"IWVGA Administrative Costs," to the extent these costs are related to 24

25 GSP implementation.

26 358. Because the budget items listed in the above paragraph reflect projects and

27 management actions, IWVGA was required to follow the procedures described in Water Code

28 section 10730.2 to readopt a lawful Readopted Extraction Fee.

98 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR

21886725.5

359. Specifically, fees adopted pursuant to Water Code section 10730.2 "shall be

3 California Constitution." (Wat. Code, § 10730.2(c).)

4 360. Pursuant to Water Code section 10730.2, therefore, IWVGA had a clear duty to

5 comply with the requirements of Section 6 of Article XIII D of the California Constitution before

6 adopting and imposing the Readopted Extraction Fee.

7 361. Plaintiffs allege that IWVGA has failed to proceed in the manner required by law,

the California Constitution, and thus acted arbitrarily and capriciously and prejudicially abused its

BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLE 10 discretion, in adopting the Readopted Extraction Fee.

7 376. As a Basin groundwater user subject to the GSP, and the Sustainable Yield Report

8 adopted on July 16, 2020, as Resolution No. 06-29, Adopting a Report on the Indian Wells Valley

9 Groundwater Basin's Sustainable Yield of 7,650 Acre-feet, Plaintiffs have a beneficial interest

J00LI puz 733.0 T'MOINHOS ENHAVA LIVAH NIMISNMONH 11

I1L7-T0TE6 VO 12 377. SGMA requires that GSPs be developed and implemented that achieve sustainable

13 groundwater management by carrying projects and management actions intended to ensure the 1021 Anacapa s 14 basin is operated within its sustainable yield and avoid or minimize subsidence. (Wat. Code, §

15 10720.1.) Consequently, sustainable yield is a crucial and fundamental element for the

16 development of implementation measures of the GSP. Further, SGMA requires that GSPs be

17 developed with "active involvement" from the diverse population within the groundwater basin.

18 (Id. at § 10727.8(a).)

19 378. Plaintiffs allege that the IWVGA employed unfair procedures, acted arbitrarily and

20 capriciously, failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and thus acted in a prejudicial

21 abuse of its discretion where the draft Sustainable Yield Report was made available to the public

22 mere hours before the public hearing on June 18, 2020, in violation of SGMA's requirement for

23 public participation. Plaintiffs further allege that the IWVGA employed unfair procedures, acted

24 arbitrarily and capriciously, failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and thus acted in a

25 prejudicial abuse of its discretion in failing to address the comments provided by Plaintiffs and

26 others regarding deficiencies in the Sustainable Yield Report prior to adopting it on July 16, 2020.

27 379. Plaintiffs allege that the IWVGA acted arbitrarily and capriciously, and so

28 prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law in adopting

101 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 the Sustainable Yield Report which erroneously purports to "determin[e] the colorable legal

2 claims to the Basin's sustainable yield," in express violation of Water Code sections 10720.5(b),

3 10726.8(b), and 10720.1(b), which prohibit GSAs from issuing water rights determinations.

4 380. Plaintiffs allege that Sustainable Yield Report is premised on factual and legal

5 flaws, all of which were brought to the attention of the IWVGA before its adoption, such that the

6 IWVGA acted arbitrarily and capriciously and tbus prejudicially abused its discretion in adopting

7 the Sustainable Yield Report.

8 381. Plaintiffs allege that the Sustainable Yield Report incorrectly determines that "the

9 Basin's entire sustainable yield is subject to a Federal Reserve interest and is therefore beyond the
d'TI'YOAIHOS HAHAVA LIVAH NIMISNMONg 10 jurisdiction of the Authority to regulate pursuant to Water Code § 10720.3 .." and therefore the

11 IWVGA acted arbitrarily and capriciously and thus prejudicially abused its discretion and failed
TTZZ-10166 VD REQEg : Jo01d puz *ponS edoery IZOl 12 to proceed in the manner required by law in adopting the Sustainable Yield Report.

13 382. Plaintiffs allege that the Sustainable Yield Report incorrectly and without

14 evidentiary support determines that allocations should not be awarded to any pumpers, which

15 determination is arbitrary and capricious and so constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

16 383. Plaintiffs allege that the Sustainable Yield Report incorrectly concludes that all

17 groundwater users in the Basin, except "De Minimis Extractors" as defined in Water Code section

18 10721(e) and "Federal Extractors," including the BLM and the Navy, "are beneficially impacted

19 by IWVGA's overdraft mitigation and augmentation projects and therefore it is not necessary to

20 establish allocations for any extractor," which conclusion is arbitrary and capricious and so

21 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

22 384. Plaintiffs allege that the Sustainable Yield Report incorrectly finds that all

23 groundwater extractors, other than De Minimis Extractors and Federal Extractors "are extracting

24 water beyond the sustainable yield and will be subject to the costs for overdraft mitigation and
an extractor obtains a court order showing they have quantifiable 25 augmentation projects, unless

26 production rights superior to the Navy's" which finding is arbitrary and capricious and SO

27 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

28

102 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 385. Plaintiffs allege that the Sustainable Yield Report incorrectly determines that "all

2 pumping should be treated equally" and such determination is arbitrary, capricious, lacking in

3 evidence, a prejudicial abuse of discretion, and in violation of the law.

4 386. Plaintiffs allege that the Sustainable Yield Report is premised on the faulty GSP

5 Basin recharge analysis and ignores the vast amount of usable groundwater in storage, and

6 therefore lacks an adequate factual basis to support the Basin's Sustainable Yield, and thus is

7 arbitrary and capricious and constitutes prejudicial abuse of discretion.

8 387. Plaintiffs allege there is no factual or legal support for the Sustainable Yield

9 Report's conclusion that the Navy is entitled to the entire 7,650 AFY sustainable yield of the
d'TI 'XOINHOS HITHVA LIVAH NIAISNMOHA 10 Basin where the Sustainable Yield Report itself acknowledges that the Navy's current production

11 is less than 1,500 AFY, and on a declining trend, and where the Navy has disclaimed that it needs
11ZZ-TOTE6 VO emqneg E 1o0ud puz toang edeoeuy 1Z0Y 12 more than 2,041 AFY in the future. Such conclusion is therefore arbitrary and capricious and

13 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

14 388. Plaintiffs allege that there is no basis for granting the Navy the entire sustainable

15 yield of the Basin where the Navy now produces less than 20 percent of the Basin's sustainable

16 yield and admits that an allocation of approximately 27 percent of the sustainable yield will

17 suffice in the future.

18 389. Plaintiffs allege that the Sustainable Yield Report falsely states that "all

19 groundwater extractors in the Basin, with the exclusion of De Minimis Extractors and Federal

20 Extractors, will be subject to the costs for overdraft mitigation and augmentation projects."

21 390. Plaintiffs allege that instead, the IWVGA arbitrarily, capriciously, and in a

22 prejudicial abuse of its discretion selectively placed the entire burden of "overdraft mitigation and

23 augmentation projects" on Plaintiffs and select other water users by exempting the City of

24 Ridgecrest, Kern County, the Indian Wells Valley Water District, Inyokern Community Services

25 District, mutual water companies, domestic users in the town of Trona, and the Navy from

26 payment of the Replenishment Fee.

27 391. Plaintiffs allege that the rationale provided by the IWVGA that these chosen water

28 users are able to use a portion of the Navy's 7,650 AFY "federal reserved water right" through a

103 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 so-called "Navy pronouncement" is an arbitrary and capricious effort to confiscate private

2 property for the benefit of public agencies and the Navy, and therefore constitutes a prejudicial

3 abuse of discretion.

4 392. Plaintiffs allege that the IWVGA established modeling scenarios used to develop

5 the sustainable yield and other program elements through closed session meetings and without

6 public participation, in contravention of Water Code section 10728.8(a). Plaintiffs are informed

7 and believe and thereon allege that the model which provides the technical foundation for the

8 GSP itself is owned by the stakeholder that will obtain the largest groundwater allocation under

9 the GSP, the Navy.

10 393. Plaintiffs allege that the Navy's model has not been peer reviewed and despite I'TT'NOTHHOS HAHaVA LLVAH NIISNMONA 11 repeated requests, it has not been made available to stakeholders. Instead, only summary
LZ-10156 VD anota puz 1oang edeoguy IZOl 12 information regarding various modeling scenarios were presented at meetings of the IWVGA

13 Board, but the underlying assumptions for each scenario have been insufficiently documented and

14 explained. Similarly, the IWVGA has not clearly articulated how the modeling scenarios have

15 informed the GSP and the management actions to be taken thereunder.

16 394. Accordingly, the IWVGA acted arbitrarily and capriciously, employed unfair

17 procedures, prejudicially abused its discretion, and failed to proceed in the manner required by

18 law in adopting the Sustainable Yield Report.

19 395. Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, mandamus can compel public

20 officials to perform an official act required by law. Mandamus may issue to compel an official

21 both to exercise discretion (if required by law to do so) and to exercise such discretion under

22 applicable law. Section 1085 authorizes this court to issue a writ of mandate "to compel the

23 performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins."

24 396. Plaintiffs petition this court for a writ of mandate or peremptory writ to compel

25 IWVGA to perform their legal duties to comply with the Constitution and all applicable laws in

26 adopting an accurate Sustainable Yield Report, and to enjoin or otherwise prevent the

27 implementation of the Sustainable Yield Report as currently adopted.

duties and prohibiting and correcting IWVGA's abuse of discretion by, among other things,
invalidating the Sustainable Yield Report. Plaintiffs have no speedy, plain or adequate remedy of
law but for this remedy.

398.

9 on Plaintiffs and upon other Basin users in violation of SGMA and the California Constitution.

21886725.5 WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 Report adopted on August 20, 2020. Plaintiffs' challenge to the Transient Pool and Fallowing

2 Program incorporates a challenge to the Pumping Verification Report.

3 405. Plaintiffs allege that the IWVGA failed to proceed in the manner required by law

4 in adopting the Transient Pool and Fallowing Program which improperly issues water rights

5 determinations, in express violation of SGMA. (See Wat. Code, §§ 10720.5(b), 10720.1(b),

6 10726.8(b).)

7 406. Plaintiffs allege that the Transient Pool and Fallowing Program is arbitrary and

8 capricious, and the IWVGA employed unfair procedures and prejudicially abused its discretion in

9 adopting it, for the following reasons.

10 407. Plaintiffs allege that the Transient Pool provides some participants with a one-time

11
motd puz "roons edsovry IZol d'TI'XONHOS HIGHVI LIVAH NIAISNMONg allocation sufficient for only a few years of continued production, while Plaintiffs receive no
I1LZ-I0IS6 VD 'ERqIg 12 allocation. A the same time, the IWVGA provides other water users, including the Navy, the City

13 of Ridgecrest, Kern County, Indian Wells Valley Water District, Inyokern CSD, "Small

14 Mutuals," "de minimis" well owners, all or the majority of their current pumping needs on an

15 annual basis. This unequal treatment is arbitrary and capricious, and violates SGMA, common

16 law water rights, and the California Constitution, and is therefore a prejudicial abuse of

17 discretion.

18 408. Plaintiffs allege that the IWVGA employed unfair procedures, acted arbitrarily and

19 capriciously and prejudicially abused its discretion in omitting Plaintiffs from the Transient Pool

20 and Fallowing Program and Pumping Verification Report on the purported basis that Plaintiffs

21 did not timely submit the required Pumping Verification Questionnaire, when Plaintiffs are

22 informed and believe and thereon allege that the IWVGA accepted new information from other

23 pumpers after March 1, 2020 and where the IWVGA failed to give Plaintiffs notice that failure

24 submit the Questionnaire by March 1, 2020 would result in a forfeiture of a right to participate in

25 the Transient Pool and Fallowing Program.

26 409. Plaintiffs allege that the Fallowing Program's assertion that the value of all

27 land located within the Basin is $9 million, is incorrect, arbitrary, capricious, lacking agricultural

28 in evidence or support, and fails to quantify the amount necessary to purchase water rights from

106 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

the agricultural operations so that no water would be pumped.

2 410. Plaintiffs allege that the condition whereby acceptance of a Transient Pool
allotment or participation in the Fallowing Program "include a release of any and all claims

4 against the IWVGA and its members on a form approved by counsel for the IWVGA" is illegal,
arbitrary, capricious, and unconscionable. There is no nexus between participation in the

6 Transient Pool and the release of legal claims against the IWVGA.
411. Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, mandamus can compel public

SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION 7

8 (Writ of Mandate for Violation of SGMA and the California Constitution in Adopting the

9 Replenishment Fee, Code of Civil Procedure, § 1085)

10 (All Plaintiffs Against Defendants IWVGA, IWVGA Board, and Does 1-100) TI NOTNHOS XRHNVI LIVAH NIZISNMONA 11 417. Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and all of the preceding
1IZZ-TOTE6 VO' 1ooL puz yaans edeseuy tZot 12 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

13 418. As a Basin groundwater user subject to the Replenishment Fee, Plaintiffs have a

14 beneficial interest and right in the enforcement of the legal duties required of IWVGA under both

15 6 SGMA and Section 6 of Article XIII D of the California Constitution and all other applicable

16 laws.

17 419. The IWVGA asserts that it adopted the Replenishment Fee pursuant to its

18 authority under Water Code section 10730.2.

19 420. Fees adopted pursuant to Water Code section 10730.2(a) "shall be adopted in

20 accordance with subdivisions (a) and (b) of Section 6 of Article XIII D of the California

21 Constitution." (Wat. Code, § 10730.2(c).) Pursuant to Water Code section 10730.2, therefore,

22 IWVGA has a clear duty to comply with the requirements of Section 6 of Article XIII D of the

23 California Constitution before imposing the Replenishment Fee and the "burden [to establish the

24 fee's validity] shall be on [IWVGA] to demonstrate compliance." (Cal. Const., art. 13D, § 6 .).

25 421. Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereupon allege that the funds derived

26 from the Replenishment Fee will be used for purposes other than that which the fee was imposed,

27 which is a violation of Article XIII D, Section 6, subdivision (b)(2) of the California Constitution.

28 The IWVGA adopted the Replenishment Fee for the stated purpose of purchasing permanent

108 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 water rights outside of the Indian Wells Valley, which would then be sold or leased to landowners

2 outside the Basin until the costly infrastructure needed to bring imported water into the Basin can

3 be approved, financed, and constructed. The IWVGA has not yet identified the source of the

4 imported water to be purchased or its timing. The IWVGA, therefore, has not based the amount of

5 the Replenishment Fee on the cost of the activities for which it is imposed.

6 422. Plaintiffs also allege that the purported transfer of the Navy's federal reserved

7 water rights to certain groundwater users free of charge, while the remaining groundwater users

8 are subject to the Replenishment Fee, violates Article XIII D, Section 6, subdivision (b)(3) of the

9 California Constitution's proportionality requirement in that the fee will be selectively imposed

10
BROWNSTEIN HYATI FARBER SCHRECK, LL on only some Basin groundwater users, yet will fund the acquisition of a water right entitlement
11 that will benefit all Basin groundwater users. As such, Plaintiffs allege that the IWVGA
Jou puz 1aang edeseay 170? TLZ-TOTEG V. *RLIBQIRE HLURS 12 prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law in adopting

13 the Replenishment Fee which is based on an illegal theory that the Navy's federal reserved water

14 right can be "carried over" and transferred off of the Navy base for non-federal purposes by non-

15 federal pumpers. Plaintiffs further allege that Navy has stated that it did "not direct, ask or imply

16 that the IWVGA should transfer" the Navy's water right to any third party.

17 423. Further, certain pumpers are exempt from the Replenishment Fee, including the

18 Navy, BLM, small mutual water companies and de minimis pumpers, even though the

19 Replenishment Fee is intended to pay for groundwater management activities benefiting such

20 exempt pumpers. As a result, in violation of Article XIII D, Section 6, subdivision (b)(3) of the

21 California Constitution, the Replenishment Fee exceeds the proportional share of the cost of

22 groundwater management activities attributable to Plaintiffs because it must also cover the cost of

23 groundwater activities attributable to pumpers exempt from the fee.

24 424. Plaintiffs allege that IWVGA has also failed to follow the explicit procedural

25 requirements set forth in Article XIII D, Section 6, subdivision (a) for the imposition of fees, as

26 follows:

27 a. The Proposition 218 Notice failed to provide an accurate location of the

28 public hearing or directions to access the hearing online, which served to

109 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

chill public comment, participation, and potential objections to adoption of
the Replenishment Fee, in violation of Article XIII D, Section 6, 2

subdivision (a)(1) of the California Constitution. 3

b. The August 21, 2020 public hearing regarding adoption of the 4

Replenishment Fee presented an artificial barrier to public comment by 5

requiring callers to telephone into a phone line that allowed only a few 6

callers at a time, necessitating a caller to try again repeatedly with no 7

guarantee of success if busy tone was reached, which served to chill 8

public comment, participation, and potential objections to adoption of the 9

Replenishment Fee, in violation of Article XIII D, Section 6, subdivision d'YI NONHHOS HNAVA LIVAH NIZISNMONA 10

(a) of the California Constitution. 11
1TLZ-TOTEG VO 'EIRQIO E 3otl puz 7330S edeseay 120t C. The Proposition 218 Notice arbitrarily, capriciously, and without any basis 12

in law, required written protests to include a signed original signature 13

14 statement, and failed to provide instructions in the Proposition 218 Notice

15 as to where original signature statements should be submitted-instead
providing those instructions online a mere two days before the hearing- 16

which served as an unlawful barrier to the submission of written protests, 17

in violation of Article XIII D, Section 6, subdivision (a) of the California 18

Constitution. 19

20 d. The Proposition 218 Notice was mailed to all property owners within the
Basin, however to comply with the procedures mandated by Proposition 21

218 it should have been mailed only to owners within the Basin who would 22

be subject to the Replenishment Fee, thus the IWVGA's faulty procedure 23

impermissibly expanded the number of protests required to form a majority 24

25 by thousands of participants who had no basis upon which to protest the fee

26 because they will not be subject to it, in violation of Article XIII D, Section
6, subdivisions (a) and (a)(2) of the California Constitution. 27

28

110 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

e. The Proposition 218 Notice failed to accurately describe the basis for the
amount of the fee proposed by including vague and conflicting language as 2

to whether the $2,112 per AF component of the Replenishment Fee will be 3

charged until imported water is "brought into the Basin," or for 4

approximately five years until "infrastructure construction" begins. Further, 5

at the August 21, 2020 hearing on the adoption of the Replenishment Fee, 6

IWVGA Board members stated orally that the Fee would be used only to 7

8 fund the acquisition of a water right entitlement and that separate funding
would need to be secured for construction of the facilities necessary to 9

10 actually import water to the Basin. The failure to accurately describe the I'TT YOTHOS ANHEVI LIVXH NILISNMONg 11 basis for the amount of the fee proposed is a violation of Article XIII D, a
Section 6, subdivision (a)(1) of the California Constitution. LLZ-TOTE6 V. RIEQIE EI Ht puz taong edeoeay 1Z0l 12

13 425. Plaintiffs allege the Replenishment Fee was calculated by arbitrary means.

14 426. Plaintiffs allege that the Replenishment Fee constitutes a financial penalty

15 intended to enforce reduction of consumption and is not for a fee for service.

16 427. Plaintiffs allege that the Replenishment Fee which attempts to force reduced

17 consumption has a disproportionate effect on the agricultural users in the Basin.

18 428. Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, mandamus can compel public

19 officials to perform an official act required by law. Mandamus may issue to compel an official

20 both to exercise discretion (if required by law to do so) and to exercise such discretion under

21 applicable law. Section 1085 authorizes this court to issue a writ of mandate "to compel the
22 performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins."

23 429. Accordingly, the IWVGA acted arbitrarily and capriciously, relied on faulty data,

24 failed to proceed in the manner required by law, employed unfair procedures, and prejudicially

25 abused its discretion in adopting the Replenishment Fee.

26 430. Plaintiffs petition this court for a writ of mandate or peremptory writ to compel

27 IWVGA to perform their legal duties to comply with the United States and California

5 invalidating Ordinance No. 03-20, Establishment of a Basin Replenishment Fee, and refunding

8 continue to impose its arbitrary and illegal Replenishment Fee on Plaintiffs and upon other Basin

9 users in violation of SGMA and the United States and California Constitutions.

10 433. Plaintiffs and other Basin users subject to the Replenishment Fee will suffer I'TT'NONHDS TAHAVI LIVAH NIISNMONg 11 irreparable harm as a result of the IWVGA's continued maintenance, application and

21 436. Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference cach and all of the preceding

22 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

23 437. IWVGA's adoption of Resolution No. 07-20 insofar as it authorizes the

24 implementation and enforcement of the Reporting Policy is contrary to law and arbitrary and

25 capricious.

26 438. Water Code section 10726.4(b), does not grant IWVGA or any GSA any well

27 permitting authority, as authorized by Resolution No. 07-20, unless such authority is properly

28 delegated by the counties overlying the Basin.

112 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 439. Furthermore, Water Code section 10726.4(b) does not compel the counties

2 overlying the Basin to provide well permit applications to the IWVGA.

3 440. Plaintiffs allege, on information and belief, that the counties overlying the Basin

4 have not delegated authority to IWVGA to implement and enforce the Reporting Policy described

5 in Resolution No. 07-20. It is therefore inappropriate and contrary to SGMA for IWVGA to

6 mandate that a well permit applicant submit their application to the IWVGA pursuant to

7 Resolution No. 07-20.

8 441. Plaintiffs allege that SGMA does not grant a GSA the authority to determine

9 whether "Material Injury" is occurring or require mitigation of "Material Injury," as defined in

10 Resolution No. 07-20, as a condition of well permit issuance.

11 442. Plaintiffs allege that the definition of "Material Injury" is overly broad and does
10L4 puz, yaans edwoery 1Z01 ITI ONHOS HILAVA LIVAH NIALSNMONI TELZ-IOIS6 VO EqIRg URS 12 not provide a valid standard by which the IWVGA could even attempt to deny an application for

13 a groundwater well or influence a county to deny an application.

14 443. Plaintiffs allege that the definition of "new groundwater extraction wells" is overly

15 broad and thus contrary to law.

16 444. Plaintiffs further allege that Resolution No. 07-20 does not address compliance

17 with SGMA's mandate that any actions to regulate, limit, or suspend extractions from

18 groundwater wells "shall be consistent with the applicable elements of the city or county general

19 plan." (Water Code § 10726.4(a)(2).)

20 445. Plaintiffs allege that the TWVGA acted arbitrarily and capriciously and thus

21 prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner required by law in adopting

23 446. Plaintiffs allege that the IWVGA acted arbitrarily and capriciously, prejudicially

24 abused its discretion, and failed to proceed in the manner required by law in adopting the

25 Reporting Policy which employs standards and a permitting process that are contrary to law.

26 447. Accordingly, the IWVGA acted arbitrarily and capriciously, employed unfair

27 procedures, prejudicially abused its discretion, and failed to proceed in the manner required by

28 law in adopting the Reporting Policy.

448. Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, mandamus can compel public

2 officials to perform an official act required by law. Mandamus may issue to compel an official
both to exercise discretion (if required by law to do so) and to exercise such discretion under

4 applicable law. Section 1085 authorizes this court to issue a writ of mandate "to compel the

5 performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins."

6 449. Plaintiffs petition this court for a writ of mandate or peremptory writ to compel

7 IWVGA to perform their legal duties to comply with the California Constitution, Water Code and

8 all applicable laws, and to enjoin or otherwise prevent the implementation of the Reporting Policy

15 452. Plaintiffs and other Basin users subject to the Reporting Policy will suffer

16 irreparable harm as a result of the IWVGA's continued implementation and enforcement of the

17 Reporting Policy.

18 453. Plaintiffs have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy of law with respect to the

26 455. Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and all of the preceding

28 456. Plaintiffs allege that the Recycled Water Program and the Option Agreement

114 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR

21886725.5

1 arbitrarily exclude Plaintiffs and other agricultural users from participation without support. By

2 allowing select Program Participants-but not Plaintiffs-to avoid paying the full Replenishment

3 Fee, the IWVGA has illegally picked winners and losers in violation of SGMA, the California

4 Constitution, and common law water rights principles.

5 457. Further, as demonstrated in the IWVGA's budget released in December 2020, the

6 Replenishment Fee would be used to fund the Recycled Water Program. Plaintiffs allege that this

7 is problematic because Plaintiffs, through their Replenishment Fee payments, would be required

8 to fund a program from which they were excluded, the sole purpose of which is to benefit other

9 water users. This scheme violates the California Constitution. (See, e.g., Cal. Const., Art. XIII D,

I'TT 'XJASHOS MNIAVA LIVAH NIZISNMONA 10 Sec. 6, subd. (b)(3) ['The amount of fee or charge imposed upon any parcel or person as an

13 1191, 1214.)

14 458. Plaintiffs allege that the IWVGA's adoption of the Recycled Water Program and

15 approval of the Option Agreement failed to comply with CEQA because the IWVGA did not

16 analyze the environmental impacts of these actions prior to their adoption, claiming instead that

17 the actions were exempt from CEQA because they concerned "design feasibility." (See Save Tara

18 V. City of West Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116.)

19 459. For these reasons, the IWVGA's adoption of Resolution No. 08-20 insofar as it

20 authorizes the implementation the Recycled Water Program and the Option Agreement is

21 contrary to law and arbitrary and capricious.

22 460. For these reasons, Plaintiffs also allege that the IWVGA acted arbitrarily and

23 capriciously and thus prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner

24 required by law in adopting the Recycled Water Program and entering into the Option

25 Agreement.

26 461. Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, mandamus can compel public

27 officials to perform an official act required by law. Mandamus may issue to compel an official

13 494. Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and all of the preceding

14 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

15 495. An action for declaratory relief is authorized by Title 28 of the United States Code

16 section 2201(a) and Section 1060 of the California Code of Civil Procedure because an actual

17 controversy exists as to the rights and other legal relations of the parties. An actual controversy

18 has arisen and now exists as to whether IWVGA's adoption of (1) the GSP, (2) the Sustainable

19 Yield Report, (3) the Transient Pool and Fallowing Program, and (4) the Replenishment Fee

20 constitutes an unlawful taking of property for public use without just compensation.

21 496. 42 U.S.C., § 1983 states:

22 Every person, who under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage of any state or territory or the District of Columbia 23 subjects or causes to be subjected any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any 24 rights, privileges or immunities secured by the constitution and law shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, 25 or other appropriate proceeding for redress ...
26 497. All individual Defendants to this claim, at all relevant times, were acting under the
27 color of state law in their capacity as officers of the IWVGA, and their acts or omissions were 28

120 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR

21886725.5

1 conducted in the scope of their employment.

2 498. The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 19

3 of the California Constitution prohibit the taking of private property for public use without just

4 compensation.

5 499. Plaintiffs hold vested overlying rights to Basin groundwater. A groundwater right

6 is an interest in real property that has value independent of any land upon which it is exercised.

7 500. SGMA requires the IWVGA to consider the interests of all beneficial uses and

8 users of groundwater, including holders of overlying and appropriative groundwater rights such

9 Plaintiffs. (Wat. Code, § 10723.2.) The IWVGA's JPA Agreement and Bylaws impose the same
d'TT'XOIHDS EAVA LIVAH NIZISNMONA 10 requirement.

11 501. SGMA also expressly forbids the IWVGA from determining or altering water
1LLZ-IOIE6 VE EIEQET EUES 100L1 puz 7oans addeuy 1Z0I 12 rights. (Wat. Code, §§ 10720.5(b), 10720.1(b), 10726.8(b).) This background legal principle

13 precludes the IWVGA's apparent assertion of authority to determine groundwater rights, enjoin

14 production and order physical measures inconsistent with the objective paramount rights of

15 overlying landowners.

16 502. Despite SGMA's clear direction to consider all beneficial uses and not determine

17 the relative priority of rights to Basin groundwater, which direction is repeated in the IWVGA's

18 JPA Agreement and Bylaws, the IWVGA administratively determined the relative priority of
that is inconsistent with background principles of law and then 19 Plaintiffs' water rights in a way

20 completely invented a presumed (fabricated) transfer of water from the Navy to the Indian Wells

21 Valley Water District, Kern County, City of Ridgecrest, and a handful of others to justify the

22 erroneous allocation. The GSP through implementation of the Annual Pumping Allocation Plan,
Transient Pool, Fallowing Program, and Replenishment Fee is based entirely upon the IWVGA'S 23

24 prioritization among competing uses and shifts the immediate burden of shortage to Plaintiffs.

25 The Replenishment Fee is set at such a level that there is no economically beneficial use of
Plaintiffs' water rights that can generate sufficient revenue to make the payment of $2,130/AF- 26

27 up to $14,910,000 per year at full maturity and approximately $255,600,000 over the next twenty

28 years, based on Plaintiffs' full production needs of 7,000 AFY. Plaintiffs allege, on information

121 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT
21886725.5

and belief, that the fee of $2,130 per AF is roughly equivalent to the wholesale cost of desalinated

2 water in San Diego County and is the highest charge ever adopted on the production of
groundwater, or replenishment thereof, at any time-in any place-in California history.
Accordingly, the IWVGA's actions deprived Plaintiffs of all economically beneficial use of their

5 water rights without just compensation, thereby committing a categorical taking.

6 503. Plaintiffs are entitled to just compensation for the total deprivation of all
economically beneficial use of their water rights, in such amount as shall be determined at trial.

18 506. If the Court finds that the IWVGA's actions did not deprive Plaintiffs of all
19 economically beneficial use of their overlying water rights as alleged in the Eleventh Cause of

20 Action, then Plaintiffs allege in the alternative that IWVGA committed an unlawful regulatory

21 taking by depriving Plaintiffs of any Annual Pumping Allocation and forcing them to pay the

22 Replenishment Fee as a pre-condition to the continued enjoyment and exercise of their overlying

23 water rights. These actions lack a real and substantial relationship to the public welfare as there is

24 no legal or scientific requirement that Plaintiffs' production of groundwater be curtailed for the

25 alleged aim of IWVGA meeting its sustainability objective by the year 2040 pursuant to SGMA.

26 507. The GSP and Implementing Actions do not merely maintain the status quo, but

27 proactively take groundwater resources that would have been extracted by Plaintiffs under their

28 vested common law water rights. The IWVGA conditioned future groundwater pumping by

Plaintiffs on payment of an exorbitant fee to while not placing the same barrier condition on

2 others and re-appropriated Plaintiffs' water rights for public use by the Navy, and to the Indian

3 Wells Valley Water District, Kern County, and City of Ridgecrest, among others, which the

4 IWVGA has arbitrarily deemed to be the recipient of a putative transfer of the alleged federal

5 reserved water rights attributable to the Navy for use on the Navy's land.

6 508. The GSP and Implementing Actions interfere with Plaintiffs' reasonable,

7 investment-backed expectations in their pistachio crops. The effect of the IWVGA's GSP and

8 Implementing Actions will make it economically infeasible to sufficiently irrigate those trees,

9 forcing Plaintiffs to let approximately 215,000 living pistachio trees die.

1 Plaintiffs allege in the alternative that IWVGA committed an unlawful physical taking. Because

2 the Basin groundwater reserved for the Navy and its fabricated transferees (including Kern

3 County, the City of Ridgecrest, and the Indian Wells Valley Water District) will be physically

4 unavailable to Plaintiffs by virtue of the GSP and the Implementing Actions, this constitutes a

5 physical taking.

6 514. As a purported justification for the unlawful physical taking, the IWVGA

7 exceeded the scope of its authority under SGMA and erroneously deemed the entire Basin's safe

8 yield to be reserved by the Navy under a "federal reserved water right" and then claimed that

9 groundwater was subject to public use to the exclusion of Plaintiffs without compensating the
BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 10 Plaintiffs for the immediate curtailment of their groundwater rights unless they paid up to

2 administratively determining the relative priority of Plaintiffs' overlying rights relative to the

3 potential rights in the Basin, without providing notice and opportunity to be heard. The IWVGA's

4 lack of procedure offered no opportunity to test competing claims and evidence, no chance to

5 cross-examine witnesses, and no ability to examine the water use practices of other groundwater

6 users. The IWVGA's actions were plainly inconsistent with the principle that other than domestic

7 use, the highest and best use of water in California is for irrigation of agriculture. (See Abatti v.

8 Imperial Irrigation Dist. (2020) 52 Cal.App.5th 236, 279-80.) IWVGA's actions deprived

9 Plaintiffs of property without due process of law-without considering Plaintiffs' relative priority

10 under common law, and instead allocating priority to persons other than Plaintiffs even though

11 Plaintiffs possess paramount overlying water rights, superior to the appropriators. The IWVGA's
Joot poz q3ans edeseuy 1ZOT IT'MOTHHOS MHHHVA LIVAH NIMISNMOXE ITLZ-101€6 VD MOREE EIURS 12 actions were targeted specifically at Plaintiffs requiring them to bear the financial burden of

13 implementation and excluding them from the Transient Pool and further deprived Plaintiffs of

14 any Annual Pumping Allocation commensurate with their paramount beneficial use under

15 reasonably efficient means and imposing the Replenishment Fee of $2,130 per AF (an

16 approximately $255 million obligation over the next 20 years).
NINETEENTH CAUSE OF ACTION 17

18 (Writ of Mandate for Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act (Public

19 Resources Code, § 21000, et seq.), Code of Civil Procedure, §§ 526, 1085, 1094.5)

20 (All Plaintiffs Against Defendants IWVGA, IWVGA Board and Does 1-100)

21 525. Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and all of the preceding
paragraphs as though fully set forth herein. 22

23 526. This Petition is brought pursuant to sections 526, 1085, and 1094.5 of the Code of

24 Civil Procedure; and Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5, and 21168.9.

25 527. The IWVGA cannot avoid CEQA review on the basis that adoption of the

26 Implementing Actions-the Sustainable Yield Report, Transient Pool and Fallowing Program,

27 and Replenishment Feeor any other discretionary action to implement the GSP-is a

28

126 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

ministerial action or on the basis that it is exempt from CEQA review pursuant to a statutory or

2 categorical exclusion.

3 528. The relied-on exemptions do not apply to the Implementing Actions. Neither the

4 statutory or categorical exemptions were proper to rely on in these circumstances.

5 529. Plaintiffs allege the Implementing Actions are not ministerial projects because
these decisions do not simply require conformance with a fixed standard or objective
measurements. Rather, they require exercise of personal judgment by the IWVGA Board as to
the wisdom and manner of carrying out the interrelated projects.

530. Each of the Implementing Actions are one of a group of connected actions to

BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLI 10 implement the GSP over which the IWVGA has discretionary decision-making authority and

11 that, collectively, will have potentially significant environmental impacts that must be studied
IAT-EOIE6 VD 'RBQIRE RALIES wooLI puz qeong edwseay 170l 12 prior to adoption. The Implementing Actions are individually subject to CEQA and must be

13 analyzed together with each interrelated action. (See Wat. Code, § 10728.6 ["a project that would

14 implement actions taken pursuant to a [GSP]" is subject to CEQA]; 14 Cal. Code Regs., §

15 15378(a) [under CEQA, "project" is defined as "the whole of an action" that has "a potential for

16 resulting" in a direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change to the environment].)

17 Failure to analyze each of the interrelated Implementing Actions together constitutes

18 segmentation, which is prohibited under CEQA.

19 531. CEQA Guidelines section 15378 defines a "project" subject to CEQA as "the

20 whole of an action, which has the potential for resulting in either a direct physical change in the

21 environment, or a reasonably foresceable indirect physical change in the environment, and that

22 is," among other things, "an activity directly undertaken by any public agency including

23 enactment and amendment of zoning ordinances . (See Pub. Res. Code §§ 21065, 21080.)

24 CEQA includes "common sense" exemption "[w]here it can be seen with certainty that there is

25 no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the environment."

26 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15061(b)(3) [emphasis added].) The California Supreme Court recently

27 summarized this standard:

28

127 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 [A] proposed activity is a CEQA project if, by its general nature, the activity is capable of causing a direct or reasonably foreseeable
2 indirect physical change in the environment. This determination is made without considering whether, under the specific
3 circumstances in which the proposed activity will be carried out, these potential effects will actually occur. Consistent with this
4 standard, a "reasonably foreseeable" indirect physical change is one that the activity is capable, at least in theory, of causing.
5 (Guidelines, § 15064, subd. (d)(3).) Conversely, an indirect effect is not reasonably foresecable if there is no causal connection between
6 the proposed activity and the suggested environmental change or if the postulated causal mechanism connecting the activity and the
7 effect is sO attenuated as to be "speculative.'

8 (Union of Medical Marijuana Patients, Inc. v. City of San Diego (2019) 7 Cal.5th 1171, 1197.)

9 532. The IWVGA's determination that its approval of the Implementing Actions is not
BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 10 subject to CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15061(b)(3) is contrary to CEQA's

11 principles. Indeed, CEQA is construed "to afford the fullest possible protection to the
TILZ-TOIC6 VO EmqNgI DoLE puz teang edeseay Izot 12 environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." (Union of Medical

13 Marijuana Patients, supra, 7 Cal.5th at 1184.) The IWVGA's action in adopting the

14 Implementing Actions without environmental review ignores this policy and CEQA's statutory

15 requirements.

16 533. Plaintiffs allege that the Implementing Actions may result in significant

17 environmental effects that must be studied under CEQA. Plaintiffs further allege that

18 individually and collectively, the Implementing Actions will cause the fallowing of agricultural

19 land across the Basin, as acknowledged on several occasions by IWVGA staff and decision-

20 makers.

21 534. Despite the express acknowledgments that the Implementing Actions will cause

22 an exodus of farming from the Basin within a matter of years, the IWVGA nevertheless failed to

23 acknowledge the need for CEQA compliance to assess the numerous potentially significant
24 environmental impacts associated with fallowing thousands of acres of agricultural land-an

25 outcome that IWVGA staff admits is not speculative.

26 535. The fallowing of agricultural lands, particularly in arid environments such as the

27 Indian Wells Valley, creates the potential for significant environmental impacts, including but

28 not limited to impacts on air quality, human health, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, biological

128 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

F resources, aesthetics, land use and local economies. Mitigation measures will be required to

2 address the environmental impacts caused by fallowing. The environmental impacts of these

3 mitigation measures must be studied under CEQA.

4 536. Plaintiffs further allege that the Implementing Actions create the potential for

5 significant land use effects, including conflicts with Kern County land use policies, such as those

6 that promote agriculture. Plaintiffs allege that the IWVGA was therefore required to prepare a

7 land use analysis that examines conflicts with existing policies and the potential for future zoning

8 changes necessitated by the Implementing Actions.

9 537. Despite repeated requests by Plaintiffs, the IWVGA failed to prepare an Initial

10 Study and/or EIR to evaluate the potentially significant impacts of the Implementing Actions, I'TI NOTHOS MHANVA LIVAH NIMISNMOHS 11 including adoption of the Sustainable Yield Report, the Transient Pool and Fallowing Program,
ITEZ-LOTE6 VE PIEORgE Joort puz tpans edeszuy Izot 12 and the Replenishment Fee.

13 538. Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2, subdivision (c), "A categorical

14 exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity

15 will have significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances."

16 539. The significant impacts and unusual circumstances described above make it

17 impossible for IWVGA to rely on a categorical exemption to approve the Implementing Actions.

18 There is more than a reasonable possibility under these circumstances that the Implementing

19 Actions will have a significant effect on the environment. Accordingly, IWVGA improperly

20 determined that the Implementing Actions are categorically exempt from CEQA.

21 540. IWVGA's improper determination that the Implementing Actions are exempt from

22 the provisions of CEQA constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

23 541. Plaintiffs allege it is impossible for the IWVGA to support its findings that the

24 Implementing Actions are not subject to CEQA and is not capable of causing a direct or

25 reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment. Plaintiffs allege, on

26 information and belief, that there is no evidence to support the finding because no analysis was

27 done. The Implementing Actions will have a significant effect on the environment. Accordingly,

28 the IWVGA improperly determined that the Implementing Actions are not subject to CEQA. The

129 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 IWVGA prejudicially abused its discretion; it did not proceed in the manner required by law,

2 failed to make required findings, and failed to support its determination with any evidence.

3 542. Plaintiffs further allege that the IWVGA failed to comply with CEQA in adopting

4 the Recycled Water Program and approving the Option Agreement because the IWVGA did not

5 analyze the environmental impacts of these actions prior to their adoption, wrongfully claiming,

6 without support, that the actions were exempt from CEQA because they concerned "design

7 feasibility." Contrary to the IWVGA's contention, CEQA was triggered because the IWVGA

8 failed to retain sufficient discretion to adopt an alternative, impose mitigation measures, or

9 disapprove the project together, once CEQA review is completed. (See Save Tara V. City of West

10 Hollywood (2008) 45 Cal.4th 116.). TT YOINHOS HAAHVJ LIVAH NIHILSNMORg 11 543. The IWVGA's improper determination that the Implementing Actions, Recycled
1LZZ-TOTE6 VO 'erqreg wot paz tpans edeseuy IZ01 12 Water Policy, and Option Agreement are not subject to the provisions of CEQA constitutes a

13 prejudicial abuse of discretion and, as such, the adoption of the Implementing Actions should be

14 set aside.

15 544. Plaintiffs, other Basin users, and the members of the general public will suffer

16 irreparable harm if the relief requested herein is not granted and the GSP Implementing Actions,

17 Recycled Water Program, and Option Agreement are allowed to go into effect in the absence of a

18 full and adequate CEQA analysis, such as that which is provided in an Initial Study or EIR, and

19 absent compliance with all other applicable provisions of CEQA.

20 545. Plaintiffs have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy of law with respect to the

21 IWVGA's unlawful policies and interpretations or its related patterns and practices.

22 546. Plaintiffs accordingly seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief

23 prohibiting IWVGA from continuing to carry out the Implementing Actions, Recycled Water

24 Program, and Option Agreement until compliance with CEQA is achieved.
TWENTIETH CAUSE OF ACTION 25

26 (Declaratory Relief, Code of Civil Procedure, § 1060)
(All Plaintiffs Against All Defendants) 27

28 547. Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate by reference each and all of the preceding

130 FIRST AMENDED VERIFIED PETITION FOR
WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

21886725.5

1 paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

2 548. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Plaintiffs and IWVGA in

3 that Plaintiffs contend that the GSP, Extraction Fee, Readopted Extraction Fee, Implementing

4 Actions, Well Reporting Policy, Recycled Water Program, and Option Agreement are invalid and

5 illegal, and that IWVGA has failed in multiple respects to comply with SGMA, CEQA, and the

6 United States and California Constitutions.

7 549. Unless and until the Court renders a judgment declaring the rights and

8 responsibilities of the parties under the law, Plaintiffs, other Basin groundwater users, and

9 IWVGA itself will have no certainty as to whether the GSP, Extraction Fee, Readopted

10 Extraction Fee, Implementing Actions, Well Reporting Policy, Recycled Water Program, and

11 Option Agreement are proper, forcing Plaintiffs and other Basin groundwater users to operate
1ow poz yaans edeoery tzot ITI'XONHHOS HNIAVA LIVAH NILISNMONA ILZ-TOIEG VO RIEqIg MuRS 12 under a scheme that violates their common law water rights and pay fees that they contend are

13 illegal. The matter is urgent because of the severe financial burden that the fees impose upon

14 agricultural users particularly. Forcing farmers to choose between paying improper fees (that they

15 can ill afford) and ceasing or reducing irrigation for crops and other valuable agricultural

16 plantings will jeopardize the viability of existing farms-including Plaintiffs' --and whose

17 businesses would otherwise be able to remain in existence if the current illegal scheme, and fees

18 were not applied to them. For most, their farms are their livelihood.

19 550. A speedy judicial determination of the rights and obligations of the parties is

20 necessary and appropriate so the parties may ascertain those rights and act accordingly.

21 551. Plaintiffs have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy at law for the harm that will

22 be caused by IWVGA's continued imposition of the GSP, Extraction Fee, Readopted Extraction

23 Fee, Implementing Actions, Well Reporting Policy, Recycled Water Program, and Option

24 Agreement at issue in this case. By continuing to impose the arbitrary scheme and fees, IWVGA

25 is failing to perform the legal duties required of it by SGMA, CEQA, and the United States and

26 California Constitutions. Judgment from this Court, declaring the rights and responsibilities of the

27 parties pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1060, is therefore necessary and appropriate.
