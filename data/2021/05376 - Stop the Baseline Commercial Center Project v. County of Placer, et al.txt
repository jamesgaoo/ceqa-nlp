-0 m en 1. By this action, Petitioner STOP THE BASELINE COMMERCIAL CENTER
PROJECT challenges Respondents COUNTY OF PLACER and PLACER COUNTY BOARD
OF SUPERVISORS' approval of the Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") for the Baseline
Commercial Center Project (Project"), the required findings under the California
Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code, section 21000 et seq., and the

n co approval of the Project.

2. The Initial Study/Mitigated Negative Declaration (" IS/MND") does not provide
adequate environmental review under CEQA. The IS/MND fails to provide an adequate project
9 description. Additionally, substantial evidence supports a fair argument that the Project may
10 have potentially significant impacts to aesthetics, traffic safety, and land use.
11 3. Petitioner seeks a determination from this Court that Respondents' approval of the
12 Project is invalid and void and that the approval of the MND for the Project fails to satisfy the
13 requirements of CEQA, and the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of Regulations,

14 section 15000 et seq.

PARTIES 15

16 4. Petitioner Stop the Baseline Commercial Center Project is an unincorporated
17 association comprised of residents of the County of Placer. Petitioner and its members have a
18 direct and substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondents comply with CEQA.
19 Petitioner is committed to the environmental values and well-being of the County of Placer and
20 its citizens, and its surroundings. The group is composed of persons whose personal, aesthetic,
21 and property interests will be severely injured if the adoption of the Project is not set aside

22 pending full compliance with CEQA and all other environmental laws. Petitioner's members
23 utilize and enjoy the County and State's natural resources. Petitioner brings this petition on
24 behalf of all others similarly situated who are too numerous to be named and brought before this
25 Court as petitioners. As group composed of residents and property owners, Petitioner is within

26 the class of persons beneficially interested in, and aggrieved by, the acts of Respondents as
27 alleged below. Petitioner participated in the administrative processes herein, and exhausted its
28 remedies. Petitioner submitted numerous written comments on the IS/MND and the Project.

2 VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- Petitioner and its members also participated in the Board of Supervisors' hearings regarding the
N m + Project. Accordingly, Petitioner has standing to sue.

5. Respondent County of Placer is a political subdivision of the State of California and
a body corporate and politic exercising local government power. Placer County is the CEQA
"lead agency" for the Project. As lead agency for the Project, Placer County is responsible for

M0 preparation of an environmental document that describes the Project and its impacts, and, if
necessary evaluates mitigation measures and/or alternatives to lessen or avoid any significant
environmental impacts,

9 6. Respondent Placer County Board of Supervisors is a legislative body duly
10 authorized under the California Constitution and the laws of the State of California to act on

11 behalf of the County of Placer. Respondent Placer County Board of Supervisors are responsible |
12 for regulating and controlling land use within the County including, but not limited to,
13 implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, 14
14 California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15000 et seq. (the "Guidelines").
15 7. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents identified as
16 Does 1-20. Petitioner is informed and believe, and on that basis alleges, that Respondents Does
1'7 1-20, inclusive, are individuals, entities or agencies with material interests affected by the
18 Project with respect to the Project or by the County's actions with respect to the Project. When --
19 the true identities and capacities of these Respondents have been determined, Petitioner will,
20 with leave of Court if necessary, amend this Petition to insert such identities and capacities.
21 8. Real Party in Interest CAL HOLDINGS, LI.C is a California limited liability
22 corporation. Cal Holdings, LLC's address is 400 Northgate Boulevard, #235, Sacramento
23 California, 95835. Cal Holdings, LLC is the party identified in the County of Placer's July 7,
24 2021 Notice of Determination as carrying out the Project.
25 9. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest
26 identified as Does 21-100. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis allege, that

27 Real Parties in Interest Does 21-100, inclusive, are individuals, entities or agencies with

28 material interests affected by the Project or by the County's actions with respect to the Project.

N0 u p BACKGROUND FACTS

10. The Project, located on two parcels, is a on a 6.8-acre site located at the southeast
corner of Baseline Road and Walerga Road in the Dry Creek West Placer area. The 31,200

square foot shopping center includes a 6,500 square foot gas station/convenience store with a
8 drive-through car wash and six-pump (12 nozzle) gas station, a 2,500 square foot oil change
9 facility, a 2,500 square foot fast-food restaurant with drive-through, and four additional retail
10 buildings ranging in size from 3,200 square feet to 6,500 square feet, as well as associated
11 parking, lighting, and landscaping.
12 11. The properties have been used as a telecommunications training, staging and
13 storage facility for Consolidated Communications. This facility contains a large
14 communications tower and associated buildings, parking areas, and gravel staging areas. After
15 completion of the Minor Boundary Line Adjustment Consolidated Communications will retain
16 the tower and building located on a 1.1-acre portion of the property.
17 12. Properties adjacent to the Project include single-family residences in the Sun

18 Valley Oaks subdivision to the south and on the west side of Walerga Road. The Consolidated
19 Communications facility and tower is located to the southeast with single-family residences, a
20 Play Care Learning Center and commercial out-buildings are to the north in the City of
21 Roseville. Large-lot residential properties (2.1 to 2.5 acre parcels) are located to the east.
22 Kitty-corner to the site at the northwest corner of Baseline Road and Walerga Road in
23 Roseville, a 115-acre vacant parcel has been approved for construction of Baseline Marketplace
24 consisting of 745,300 square feet of restaurant and retail space with up to three gas stations.

25 13. The Project site is designated Rural Low Density Residential, 1 to 2.3 acre
26 minimum in the Dry Creek West Placer Community Plan and is zoned RS-AG-B-40 PD = 1
27 (Residential Single Family, combining Agriculture, combining Minimum Building Site of
28 40,000 square feet, combining Planned Residential Development of 1 unit/acre). The Project

VERIFIED PETITIÓN FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

cJauawn includes a rezoning of the Project site to CPD-UP-Dc (Commercial Planned Development, --

combining Use Permit, combining Design Scenic Corridor).

14. The Project includes one entry on Baseline Road, one entry on Walerga Road, and
one entry on Crowder Lane, The Baseline Road and Walerga Road driveways will be restricted
to right turn ingress and egress only. Full access is provided on Crowder Lane with both right
and left turning movements at the Crowder Lane/Baseline Road intersection.

B. APPROVAL OF THE PROJECT

15.

9 On March 3, 2021, Placer County released the IS/MND for public review and
comment. (SCH 2021020058.)

10 16.

11 On March 10, 2021 the West Placer Municipal Advisory Council ("WPMAC")

12 considered the Project at a virtual public meeting. WPMAC members raised numerous issues

13 that included: access and Crowder Lane impacts; plans for nearby gas stations particularly in

14 the proposed Baseline Marketplace project; the amount of planned commercial space in the

15 area; impacts to existing residents; the need for more outreach; the type of tenants and uses

16 anticipated for the project; and whether the building sizes and layout were anticipated to be

17 flexible. In a 4-0 vote, WPMAC recommended that the Planning Commission and Placer
County Board of Supervisors deny the Project.
18 17.

19 On March 25, 2021, the Placer County Planning Commission held a public hearing

20 on the Project. Issues raised included: the noise impacts from the hours of operation for the car

21 wash; noise produced by parking lot sweeping and deliveries; offsite impacts from noise and

22 lighting; traffic generated by the project; perceived dangerous conditions at the -

23 Crowder/Baseline intersection; the potential for cut-through traffic through the Sun Valley

24 Oaks neighborhood to the south; potential for groundwater contamination from leaking tanks

25 and site runoff; neighborhood compatibility and appropriateness of use; water consumption

26 from the car wash facility; the possibility of increased crime; an over-abundance of existing and

27 proposed retail nearby that is not needed or wanted; the future of gas stations in general;

28 creation of strip commercial along Baseline Road; that gas stations and fast food are not

neighborhood-serving; and the number of entitlements requested.

VERIFIED PETITIÓN FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 5

P 0 -Nm vI 18. The Planning Commission voted 5-2 to recommend that the Placer County Board
of Supervisors approve the Project as proposed with three recommended modifications to the
proposed Conditions of Approval:

a. Condition 1: Replace "16-pump gas station" with "six
gas station" to limit the size of the future pump and 12 nozzle

gas station as agreed to by the applicant;

b. Condition 117: Change the permitted hours of truck deliveries from "6:00
a.m. until to 10:00 p.m." to "7:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m."

C.

10 garbage pick-up from "6:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m." to "7:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m."

19.

11 In June 2021, the County released an Erratum to the IS/MND.

20.

12 On July 6, 2021, the Board of Supervisors held a public hearing on the Project. In

13 approving the Project, the Board of Supervisors took the following actions:

a.

14 adopted the Mitigated Negative Declaration and Mitigation Monitoring
Program (SCH #2021020058);
15 b.

16 adopted Resolution to amend the Dry Creek West Placer Community Plan

17 land use designation of the Baseline Commercial Center project site from Rural Low Density

22 unit/acre) to CPD-UP-Dc (Commercial Planned Development, combining Use Permit,
combining Design Scenic Corridor);
23 d.

24 approved a Minor Boundary Line Adjustment to combine 0.8 acres of APN

25 023-221-020-000 with the six-acre APN 023-221-021-000 to create the 6.8-acre project site and

13 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY

14 24.

15 Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant action

16 and bas exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.
25.

28 Notice of Determination as required by Public Resources Code section 21167(c).

VERIFIED PETTTION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

> CC O0AWN 29, STANDING

Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because Petitioner
and its members' aesthetic and environmental interests are directly and adversely affected by
the Respondents' approval of the Project.
CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act,

30. Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)

9 Petitioner realleges and incorporate by reference Paragraphs I through 29,
inclusive, of this Petition, as if fully set forth below.
31.
10

11 Respondents committed prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in

12 a manner required by law by relying on an IS/MND that fails to meet CEQA's requirements -

13 for disclosure, analysis, and/or mitigation of significant project impacts.
32.

14 Respondents' action in adopting the IS/MND violates CEQA in that Respondents
failed to proceed in the manner required by law and their decision not

15 to prepare an

33.
16 environmental impact report ("EIR") is not supported by substantial evidence.

17 Approval of the Project, based on a MND instead of an EIR violates CEQA as

18 substantial evidence supports a fair argument that the Project may have potentially significant

19 impacts. CEQA requires full disclosure of a project's significant environmental effects so that

20 decision makers and the public are informed of consequences before a project is approved, to

21 ensure that government officials are held accountable for these consequences. (Laurel Heights

22 Improvement Ass'n of San Francisco v. Regents of the University of California ("Laurel Heights'
/") (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.)

34.
23

24 An agency must prepare an EIR. instead of a MND whenever a proposed project

25 may have a significant impact on the environment. (Pub. Resources Code. § 21082.2(d) ["If

26 there is substantial evidence, in light of the whole record before the lead agency, that a project

27 may have a significant effect on the environment, an environmental impact report shall be

28 prepared."]) An agency's decision not to prepare an EIR is judged by the "fair argument"
standard of review. Under this standard. an EIR must be prepared "whenever it can be fairly
argued on the basis of substantial evidence that the project may have significant environmental
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 8

-N0 T0Nc impact." (No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75, emphasis added; Laurel
Heights Improvement Assn. V. Regents of University of California (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1123.)
A. THE IS/MND CONTAINS A LEGALLY INADEQUATE PROJECT DESCRIPTION
35, An initial study must accurately describe the proposed project. (Guidelines
§15071(a).) "An accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an

informative and legally sufficient [CEQA document]." (County of Inyo V. City of Los Angeles
(1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 193.) CEQA requires a complete project description to ensure that
all of the project's environmental impacts are considered. (City of Santee V. County of San
9 Diego (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1450, 1454; see also Communities for a Better Environment v.
10 City of Richmond (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 70, 82.) A curtailed, enigmatic or unstable project
11 description draws a red herring across the path of public input." (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue
12 Center v. County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 656; quoting County of Inyo, supra,
13 71 Cal.App.3d at 197-198.)
14 36. The Project Description fails to provide critical information regarding sewer and
15 water.

16 B. SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE SUPPORTS A FAIR ARGUMENT THE PROJECT MAY
17 HAVE SIGNIFICANT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT.
18 37. Substantial evidence in the administrative record supports a "fair argument" that 19 the Project may result in a significant impact to the environment.
20 1. AESTHETICS

21 38. Lay comments by local residents regarding the Project's impacts to aesthetics,
22 including light pollution in an otherwise rural area, constitutes substantial evidence to support a
23 fair argument that the Project may have significant impacts. (Georgetown Preservation Society
24 (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 358, 375-376.)
25 39. Additionally, the expert comments by James Benya regarding the Project's
26 impacts from lighting constitutes a fair argument that the Project may have significant impacts
27 to aesthetics that were not fully mitigated.

28 //

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

OurAwN 2.

40. Traffic Safety
The IS/MND concludes that issues associated with traffic safety are less than
significant. Numerous nearby residents with personal knowledge of existing traffic conditions
submitted comments that the Project will result in unsafe traffic conditions. These comments
are not limited to the concerns about increased traffic, but also about safety. For instance, local
residents have indicated that the Project will increase traffic on Crowder Lane and adjoining -

8

9 surface streets of Springhill Drive and Clouds Hill Drive as a shortcut to and from the new

10 center. Residual traffic can also be expected to also spill over to Muirwood Lane and

11 Blackwood Land in Bianhi Estates, which are narrow, quiet residential roads. Additionally, the

12 grading and landscaping on it Crowder Lane makes it difficult to see oncoming traffic and creates

13 a safety hazard. The increased traffic from the Project will increase the existing unsafe traffic

14 conditions. The record also demonstrates that since the traffic study was prepared 18 months

15 ago, there have been recent developments in the area that impact traffic flow and safety,
resulting in an outdated and inaccurate traffic study.

41.

16

17 These lay comments constitute substantial evidence that support a fair argument

18 that the Project may result in traffic impacts. (See Mejia v. City of Los Angeles, supra, 130

19 Cal.App.4th 322 (traffic); Citizens Association for Sensible Development of Bishop Area V.
County of Inyo, supra, 172 Cal.App.3d at 172 (traffic).)

3.

20 Land Use

42.

21

22 CEQA requires an environmental document to discuss any inconsistencies between

23 the Project and the applicable general plans, specific plans and regional plans. (CEQA

24 Guidelines, § 15125(d).) An applicable plan is a plan that has been adopted and legally applies

25 to the Project. (Chaparral Greens v. City of Chula Vista (1996) 50 Cal.App.4th 1134, 1145, n.

26 2.) By identifying a project's inconsistencies with applicable plans means that a lead agency a

27 may be able to modify the project to avoid the inconsistencies. (See Orinda Ass'n v. Board of

28 Supervisors (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 1145, 1169.) While an inconsistency with policies of harea

applicable plans does not necessarily mean that the project will have a significant environmental |
impact CEQA requires that the environmental document contain the discussion and analysis.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 10

(See Joshua Tree Downtown Business Alliance v. County of San Bernardino (2016)
00 OGAwN Cal.App.5th 677, 695; Pocket Protectors v. City of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 903.)
45. The IS/MND fails to discuss and identify numerous policies of the Dry Creek-West |
Placer Community Plan. The Project is not consistent with the following:

a. Community Design Policy 8: A void the creation of new commercial areas
along Baseline road, west of Brady Lane in order to prevent strip commercial development
conflicting land uses, and areas of additional traffic conflicts, etc.

b. Land Use Policy 3: The retention of important open space features is

9 critical to the future quality of life in the Plan area.

10 C. Land Use Policy 16: Establish conservation and rehabilitation of existing

I1 a areas as a priority.

12 d. Land Use Policy 19: Prevent strip commercial areas.
13 46. The IS/MND needs to discuss these Policy and determine whether the inconsistency

14 results in significant impacts to land use.
