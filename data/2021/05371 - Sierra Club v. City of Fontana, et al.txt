24 INTRODUCTION

25 1. This action challenges the approval by Respondent City of Fontana ("City') on or

26 about June 22, 2021 of a land use project known as the Slover and Oleander Industrial

27 Building Project ("the Project"). The Project will develop a 8.6-acre vacant site with a

28 large industrial building totaling 205,949 square feet. The Project will be operated as

-1-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 "logistics warehouse." The Project is fundamentally incompatible with the

3 surrounding neighborhood as it will subject neighbors and school children to its

4 relentless industrial operations: the Project site is surrounded by existing single-
family residences, the closest being within 128 feet, and it is directly adjacent to

6 Jurupa Hills High School. The approval of the Project goes against the

7 recommendation of the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") that warehouse

8 land uses should not be located within 1,000 feet of sensitive receptors such as
children.

9

10 2. Sierra Club brings this action seeking to vacate the Project approvals because the City

11 failed to conduct appropriate analysis of the Project pursuant to the California

12 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), and the City failed to adopt appropriate

13 mitigation to offset the long-term, adverse harms resulting from the Project.

14 3. The California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code §

15 21000 et seq.) requires an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for any project that

16 may have a significant adverse effect on the environment. Despite reasoned

17 comments in the record regarding the Project's significant environmental effects, the

18 City declined to prepare an EIR for the Project, instead relying upon a lesser level of

19 CEQA review, a Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND"). This was in error where

20 the record contains substantial evidence of a "fair argument" of significant

21 environmental harm. Additionally, the City erred in approving the Project because the

22 record lacks sufficient information, such as facts and analysis, to support the
conclusions of the MND .

23 4.

24 As a result of these CEQA violations, Sierra Club respectfully requests issuance of a

25 peremptory writ of mandate setting aside the approvals of the Project. (Code Civil
Procedure, §§ 1085 and 1094 5.)

26

27 5. By this verified Petition, Petitioner, Sierra Club, alleges the following:

16 STATEMENT OF FACTS
17 The Project

18

19 13. The Project is a proposal for the construction and operation of a 205,949 square foot

20 industrial building at the southwest corner of the Slover and Oleander Avenue

21 intersection in the City of Fontana. The Project is designed to operate as a

22 "warehouse logistics" facility for the receipt, handling, processing, storage, and

23 movement of goods. Heavy-duty diesel trucks, traveling from points unknown, will

24 transport goods to the Project facility, while other diesel trucks will transport those
goods to destinations unknown.
25

26 14. Land uses surrounding the logistics warehouse include existing single-family homes

27 immediately north of the Project site on the northside of Slover Avenue; existing

28 single-family homes east of the Project site on the eastside of Oleander Avenue;
vacant and undeveloped land to the west that is zoned for commercial uses; and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE -4-

-

2 Jurupa Hills High School to the immediate south of the Project site. The high school
shares a physical boundary with the Project site.

3

4 15. The Project site is zoned M-1 under the City's Municipal Code. Per Municipal Code

5 Section 3-522, the M-1 zone allows Light Industrial Uses to include "high

6 cube/warehousing" except "logistics businesses" that "generate high volumes of
truck traffic".

7

8 16. Vehicular access to the Project site will be provided by one driveway on Slover

9 Avenue and two driveways on Oleander Avenue. The Project's southern driveway

10 connects the Project's loading docks, on the west side of the building, with Oleander

11 Avenue, on the east side of the site, and it is designed to serve both passenger vehiclesl

12 and heavy trucks. As such, the site's circulation plan may include trucks traveling

13 along the southern drive-lane to/from the Project's loading docks, along the boundary

14 with the existing high school. Current site plans do not show any fencing or barrier

15 between the Project's southern elevation and the adjacent high school facility. Currentl

16 landscape plans show the planting of single row of trees, 24 inch box size, spaced

17 approximately 20-30 feet apart, along the Project's southern elevation, between the

18 Project's southern drive lane and the high school property.

19 17. Construction of the Project building, associated infrastructure and other

20 improvements is expected to occur over a period of eight months.

21 18. Once operational, the Project building may be used for cold storage, i.e.,

22 refrigerated/freezer warehouse space, and it will be operational 24 hours per day,
seven days per week.
23

24 19. The Project building will have 22 loading docks on the west side of the building. In

25 addition to loading and unloading activity at the loading docks, exterior operations
include truck movements within the

26 site and the operation of forklifts and other on-

27 site equipment (e.g., yard goats/yard hostlers).

28 20. The Project is assumed to generate 272 passenger vehicle trips and 114 truck trips per
day on average. The Project is expected to demand approximately 2,360,116 kilowatt

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE -5-

hours of electricity per year, 2,896,108 units of natural gas per year, and 182,172
gallons of fuel mostly due to off-site diesel truck trips.

L 21. The Project includes the following approvals authorizing the development proposal
which is the subject of this lawsuit:
5 a. Adoption of an Initial Study, Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND")

7 and Mitigation, Monitoring, and Reporting Program (*MMRP"); and

8 b. Resolution PC No. 2021-17 approving Tentative Parcel Map No. 20367

9 (TPM No. 20-018) to consolidate seven (7) parcels into one parcel for the

10 development of the logistics and distribution facility, and approving

11 Design Review No. 20-027 to construct an approximately 205,949 square

12 foot logistics and distribution facility on approximately 8.610-acres of land
including approximately 20,000 square feet of two-story office space.
13 The Project's Administrative Process
14

15 22. On March 31, 2021, the City of Fontana prepared and/or circulated a Notice of Intent

16 to Adopt a Negative Declaration ("NOI'), with a period for public comment from
March 31, 2021 to April 20, 2021.
17

18 23. On April 20, 2021, the final date for public comments on the MND, the City of

19 Moreno Valley Planning Commission held public hearing on the proposed Project

20 and voted to adopt the MND and approve the Project. At this hearing, numerous

21 residents testified in opposition to the proposed Project. Residents testified the Project

22 will increase truck traffic on local roadways, and it will negatively impact students at

23 the high school because of noise and traffic issues.

24 24 On or about April 29, 2021, a resident appeal was timely filed ("Appeal No. 21-002")

25 requesting to overturn the Planning Commission's actions including the adoption of
the MND and MMRP.

26

27 25. On June 22, 2021, the City Council conducted a public hearing concerning Appeal

28 No. 21-002. The Council voted 3-1 in favor of adopting the MND and approving the
Project.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE -6-

26.On June 24, 2021, the City posted and filed the Project's Notice of Determination
("NOD") pursuant to CEQA. This action is timely filed.
co t 27. The maintenance of this action is for the purpose of enforcing important public
policies of the State of California with respect to the protection of the environment
5 under CEQA and conformance with state law. The maintenance and prosecution of
6 this action will confer a substantial benefit upon the public by protecting the public
7 from environmental and other harms alleged in this Petition. Petitioner is acting as a
8 private attorney general to enforce these public policies and prevent such harm.
9 28. The City's approval of the Project will cause Petitioner irreparable injury for which
10 Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law. Petitioner and its members will be
11 irreparably harmed by the City's actions in approving the Project. Petitioner was
12 harmed by, among other things, the failure of the City to require the preparation of a
13 EIR to adequately evaluate the potential impacts of the Project, and by the City's
14 approval of the Project without providing adequate and effective mitigation measures
15 contrary to the requirements of State law.
16 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES AND CEQA LITIGATION
17 REQUIREMENTS
18 29. During the Project's administrative review process, Petitioner commented that the
19 CEQA review was inadequate in that the MND failed to properly disclose and
20 evaluate impacts and/or support its conclusions with evidence; that the record
21 supported a fair argument of significant impacts to/from the following: air quality,
22 land use/planning, noise, among others; and that the City did not adopt adequate
23 mitigation for these potential effects or adopt all feasible mitigation.
24 30. As a result of these comments in the record, Petitioner exhausted administrative
25 remedies pursuant to the requirements of Cal. Public Resources Code, § 21177.
26 31. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing the action by complying
27 with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167. 5, in notifying Respondent
28 of the filing of this action (attached hereto as Exhibit "A"), and by complying with the

-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.6, in notifying Respondent of
2 Petitioner's election to prepare the record of proceedings in connection with this
00 v action (attached hereto as Exhibit "B").
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
Un o 32. This Court has jurisdiction to issue writs of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure
§§ 1085 and 1094.5.

7 33. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §g 393 and 394 as

8 the Project is located in, and the relevant events occurred in, San Bernardino County,
9 and because the City is located in San Bernardino County.
10 CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (WRIT OF MANDATE- VIOLATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL
QUALITY ACT, AS TO ALL PARTIES)
12

13 a. The City wrongly adopted a Mitigated Negative Declaration for the Project when there was substantial evidence of a fair argument of significant
14 environmental impacts as a result of the Project.

15 34 Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 33 above as though

16 set forth in full herein.

17 35. As the lead agency, Respondent City is charged with the duty to fully and accurately

18 consider the environmental consequences of the Project through the preparation of an

19 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"). (Public Resources Code, § 21080 (d).)

20 36. The EIR requirement is the "heart of CEQA" (Cal. Code of Regs., Tit. 14 "State

21 CEQA Guidelines," § 15003(a).) cOp

22 37. An EIR is required for any proposed project that may have a significant effect on the

23 environment. (Public Resources Code, § 21100 (a).)

24 38. If a lead agency is presented with a "fair argument" based on substantial evidence in

25 the record that a proposed project may have a significant effect on the environment,

26 the lead agency shall prepare an EIR even though it may be presented with other

27 substantial evidence that the proposed project will not have a significant effect. (State

28 CEQA Guidelines, § 15064 f)(1).)

-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F

2 39. A lead agency may prepare a mitigated negative declaration for a project only when:

3 (1) revisions in the project would avoid or mitigate the potentially significant project

A effects to a point where clearly no significant effects would occur; and (2) there is no

Un substantial evidence in light of the whole record that the project as revised may have a

6 significant effect on the environment. (State CEQA Guidelines, 15070 (b).)

7 40. The City was presented with substantial evidence of a fair argument that the Project

8 may significantly affect the environment within the meanings of CEQA for impacts

9 to/from, but not limited to, air quality, energy, environmental justice, greenhouse gas

10 emissions, land use/ planning, and noise. Petitioner and others submitted comments to

11 the City based on substantial evidence that the Project may result in significant

12 environmental impacts that were not adequately evaluated and/or mitigated.

13 41. By way of example, Petitioner commented the record supports a "fair argument" of

14 significant environmental impacts, and an EIR is required by law, because the Project

15 a is a new source of greenhouse gas emissions ("GHGs"), and it is not shown that the

16 Project's GHG impacts are mitigated to a level below significance thresholds. The

17 MND relies on vague and ill-defined measures that do not demonstrate that the

18 Project's GHG's impacts are mitigated with any level of certainty. Without certain

19 and effective mitigation, the Project will produce GHGs above the adopted thresholds

20 of significance. An EIR is required under these circumstances.

21 42. By way of further example, the record supports a "fair argument" of significant land

22 use impacts as the Project is not consistent with the City of Fontana General Plan and

23 General Plan EIR's mitigation program, including, but not limited to, the General

24 Plan's Infrastructure and Green Systems Chapter, Goal 7 Policy 1 regarding the

25 City's goal to "promote renewable energy" towards the goal of "becoming a zero net

26 energy city." The Project does not include any renewable energy systems - e.g., solar

27 PV panels - when such measures are patently feasible.

28 43. By adopting the MND for the Project where there is substantial evidence supporting a
fair argument that the Project may result in significant environmental effects, the City

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE -9-

committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and the Project approvals must be set
aside. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5; Public Resources Code, § 21168)
m0 7 4 b. The Initial Study Fails as an Informational Document.
44 Under CEQA, a prejudicial abuse of discretion may occur when relevant information
is not presented to the public agency. "When the informational requirements of
6 CEQA are not complied with, an agency has failed to proceed in 'a manner required
7 by law' and has therefore abused its discretion." (Lighthouse Field Beach Rescue v.

8 City of Santa Cruz (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 1170, 1200.) "The failure to comply with
9 the law subverts the purposes of CEQA if it omits material necessary to informed
10 decisionmaking and informed public participation." (Lighthouse, supra, 131
11 Cal.App.4th at 1201.)
12 45. CEQA requires that the lead agency investigate impacts. "CEQA places the burden
13 of environmental investigation on government rather than the public." (Gentry v. City
14 of Murrieta (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1379.) "Where an agency ... fails to gather
15 information and undertake an adequate environmental analysis in its initial study, a
16 negative declaration is inappropriate. (City of Redlands v. County of San Bernardino
17 (2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 398, 406-408.)
18 46. Petitioner commented that the Initial Study fails to adequately evaluate and disclose
19 impacts and/or substantiate its conclusions, despite comments in the record that
20 information was lacking or that conclusions were not supported by facts or analysis.
21 The Initial Study fails to substantiate its conclusion of "less than significant" or "less
22 than significant with mitigation" with respect to impacts including to/from:
23 cumulative air quality emissions, energy, environmental justice, and land use impacts.
24 47. By way of example: the Initial Study fails to disclose or analyze the Project's
25 cumulative air quality impacts in terms of the numerous other logistics warehouses
26 recently constructed or approved for construction in the City. As many of these
27 warehouse projects are currently operating, or will operate, in the immediate vicinity
28 of the proposed Project, and as many of those projects were found by their respective

-10-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 EIRs to generate cumulatively significant air quality impacts, the absence of these

0 projects from the Initial Study's analysis was in error, and the record fails to contain

4 sufficient information by which the City could reasonably conclude that the Project's

5 individual contribution to air quality emissions is less-than-significant.

6 48. As a result of these and other failures of the City to properly disclose and evaluate

7 potential adverse impacts, the public and decision-makers were deprived of sufficient

8 information to understand the adverse impacts of the proposed Project.
WHEREFORE, Petitioner
9 prays for the following relief on all causes of action:

10 49. For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring Respondent to set aside its

11 decision approving the MND and the land use approvals for the Project. (Public

12 Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.9; Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1094.5, 1085)

13 50. For costs of this suit, including attorney's fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure, §
1021.5 and other provisions of law.
14

15 51. For such other and further relief, including a stay or preliminary and permanent

16 injunctive relief, in the event that the Real Parties in Interest, or their agents or

17 instrumentalities, intend to commence construction on the site during the litigation.
(Code of Civil Procedure $ 526.)

18

19 52. For such other relief as may be just and proper.

1 TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA:

2 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21167.7, that
on July 23, 2021, Petitioner, SIERRA CLUB, filed a Verified Petition for Peremptory Writ of

4 Mandate ("Petition") pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQ A")

6 Oleander Industrial Building project ("the Project'). The Project involves the development of a

7 8.6-acre site with an industrial building totaling 205,949 square feet. The Petition alleges the City

8 failed to comply with CEQ Ain adopting Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") for the

9 Project.

11 residences and a high school, yet the adverse harms associated with the Project have not been

12 properly evaluated and mitigated in violation of CEQ A.F or the reasons alleged in the Petition

13 (transmitted herewith), the decisions approving the Project and adopting the Project's MND
must be overturned.
