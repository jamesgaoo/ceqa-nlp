VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1. In this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and

2 Injunctive Relief, Petitioner/Plaintiff Martinez Refining Company LLC ("MRC" or

3 "Petitioner/Plaintiff") asks this Court to declare as invalid, unenforceable, and ultra vires the July

4 21, 2021 adoption of amendments to "Regulation 6-5: Particulate Emissions from Refinery

5 Fluidized Catalytic Cracking Units 2021 Amendment" (those amendments are referred to herein

6 as the "Rule 6-5 Amendment") by Respondent/ Defendant Bay Area Air Quality Management

7 District (the "District") through the actions of its Board of Directors ("Board"), including the

8 Notice of Determination dated August 6, 2021 ("NOD") and filed on August 9, 2021 in Solano

9 County, and thereafter in other counties.

10 2. Petitioner/Plaintiff further seeks a writ of mandate ordering the District to vacate and

11 rescind the District's adoption of the Rule 6-5 Amendment, as well as appropriate declaratory relief,

12 injunctive relief, and reasonable costs incurred by Petitioner/Plaintiff to bring this action.
13 Petitioner/Plaintiff further alleges as follows:

14 INTRODUCTION

15 3. The Rule 6-5 Amendment is aimed at reducing total particulate matter ("TPM"),

16 sulfur dioxide ("SO2"), and ammonia emissions from Fluidized Catalytic Cracking Units

17 ("FCCUs") operating at refineries in the Bay Area, and will apply to MRC's refinery located in

18 Martinez, California ("Refinery").

19 4. To achieve TPM reductions, the Rule 6-5 Amendment requires Bay Area refineries'

20 FCCUs to meet a 0.01 grains per dry standard cubic foot ("gr/dscf") standard within five years of

21 July 21, 2021.

22 5. Although the Rule 6-5 Amendment does not specify a particular emission control

23 technology to meet the 0.01 gr/dscf TPM standard, during the rulemaking process, the only

24 technology the District determined was capable of meeting this standard is a Wet Gas Scrubber

25 ("WGS"), which the District indicated it considers "Best Available Retrofit Control Technology",

26 referred to herein as "BARCT." (Bay Area Air Quality Management District, Final Staff Report

27 (May 2021), p. 17 ["The proposed total PM10 limit of 0.010 gr/dscfat 5% oxygen represents an

28

2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

achievable level of control that has been demonstrated to be feasible at multiple facilities through

2 the use of wet gas scrubbers"].)

3 6. MRC provided comments throughout the rulemaking process demonstrating the

4 technical infeasibility, cost-prohibitive nature, and significant environmental impacts of the

5 District's BARCT determination. (See MRC Comment Letters dated July 13, 2020, April 29, 2021,

6 April 30, 2021, May 18, 2021, June 1, 2021, and July 20, 2021.)

7 7. In light of the foregoing, MRC proposed a feasible alternative TPM reduction (0.02

8 gr/dscf TPM standard) that would achieve significant TPM reductions while avoiding the

9 significant costs and environmental impacts of the District's BARCT determination.

10 8. However, although MRC's alternative TPM reduction proposal was initially

11 considered by District staff, it was improperly removed from consideration and not presented to the

12 District Board when the Rule 6-5 Amendment was adopted with the 0.01 gr/dscf TPM standard.

13 9. Furthermore, when adopting the Rule 6-5 Amendment, the District flagrantly

14 ignored numerous mandatory requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA")

15 and the California Health and Safety Code ("H&S Code").

16 10. The District's adoption of the Rule 6-5 Amendment also violated California

17 common law.

18 11. These failings render the Rule 6-5 Amendment ultra vires, illegal, and

19 unenforceable.

20 12. When promulgating rules and regulations, the District is required to comply with the

21 requirements of CEQA, Public Resources Code, §§ 21000 et seq. CEQA is further implemented by

22 the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of Regulations, §§ 15000 et seq. (the "CEQA

23 Guidelines").

24 a. CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines impose procedural and substantive

25 requirements on public agencies when they undertake or approve an activity

26 defined by CEQA as a "project."

27 b. Among other things, CEQA requires an initial environmental study to determine

28 if a "project" will have a significant effect on the environment. If so, the lead

3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

agency must prepare an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") evaluating

2 numerous criteria, including cumulative environmental impacts of the action,

3 project alternatives, and mitigation measures.

4 c. The District ignored the requirements of CEQA by relying on the "2018 Final

5 Environmental Impact Report - AB 617 Expedited Best Available Retrofit

6 Technology (BARCT) Implementation Schedule" (the "2018 EIR") which did

7 not consider the impacts of the Rule 6-5 Amendment itself, including without

8 limitation, the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts from the massive

9 consumption of fresh water; the generation of massive amounts of greenhouse
10 gas emissions, wastewater, and hazardous materials; and the significant
11 aesthetics impacts to meet the 0.01 gr/dscf TPM standard of the Rule 6-5

12 Amendment.

13 d. The 2018 EIR also did not evaluate all of the reasonable alternatives for the Rule

14 6-5 Amendment project that were subsequently considered and approved of by

15 the District during its rulemaking process for the Rule 6-5 Amendment-

16 including MRC's alternative TPM reduction proposal. This vital omission

17 deprived the public of a full and complete assessment of the alternatives, their

18 relative impacts, and potential mitigation options.

19 e. These actions plainly violate CEQA and other related requirements of California

20 law.

21 13. In addition to CEQA, the District violated several provisions of the H&S Code when

22 adopting the Rule 6-5 Amendment. The California Legislature adopted these provisions to

23 constrain the District's authority and the District cannot simply choose to ignore those provisions

24 when they prove inconvenient.

25 a. Among other things, the Rule 6-5 Amendment requires FCCU units to meet a

26 0.01 gr/dscf TPM standard. But the WGS technology likely required to meet this

27 standard (and which forms the foundation of the District's BARCT

28 determination) will have significant adverse cost, operational, and business

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

impacts to regulated refineries. And in the case of MRC, installation of a WGS is

2 technically infeasible given the lack of available space at the Refinery.

3 b. The District adopted its 0.01 gr/dscf TPM standard without properly analyzing

4 MRC's proposed alternative TPM emissions limitation-a 0.02 gr/dscf TPM

5 standard. A TPM standard of 0.02 gr/dscf would result in nearly identical

6 reductions in ambient TPM concentrations as the 0.01 gr/dscf standard.

7 Although District staff initially considered this alternative, the District

8 improperly removed it from consideration and adopted the 0.01 gr/dscf TPM

9 standard, which imposes unprecedented costs, was not analyzed for significant
10 environmental impacts, and would produce only marginal incremental reductions
11 compared to the 0.02 gr/dscf TPM alternative.

12 c. The District asserts that it has taken these actions in order to fulfill the

13 requirements of AB 617 and its implementing statutory provisions, including

14 H&S Code § 40920.6, which address planning for and requiring the installation

15 of BARCT at certain stationary sources in California. At the same time, the

16 District has failed to properly reference and comply with the requirements of

17 these underlying laws, including with respect to key considerations of

18 achievability, cost-effectiveness, and incremental cost-effectiveness for its

19 BARCT determination and the related 0.01 gr/dscf TPM standard established by

20 the Rule 6-5 Amendment. The District cannot have it both ways: if it wants to

21 take action under AB 617 and H&S Code $ 40920.6, it must comply with the

22 statutory requirements of those laws.

23 d. The District's actions also run afoul of H&S Code § 40606, which requires that

24 BARCT be "achievable"; H&S Code § 40703, which requires an assessment of

25 cost-effectiveness; H&S Code § 40728.5, which requires the District to "actively

26 consider the socioeconomic impact of regulations"; and H&S Code § 40727,

27 which requires the District to make numerous findings in the record that it

28 simply ignored and skipped.

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

14. The District is not free to ignore the commands of the California Legislature, which

2 has established both substantive and procedural requirements that the District failed to comply with

3 in adopting the Rule 6-5 Amendment.

4 15. These failings are compounded by the District's procedural irregularities and failure

5 to give appropriate consideration to comments submitted by MRC.

6 16. The District also violated core tenets of California common law by, among other

7 things, ignoring valid and real-world data submitted by MRC and other impacted refineries and

8 conducting a sham cost-benefit analysis during the rulemaking process, rendering the Rule 6-5

9 Amendment and the accompanying Resolution 2021-10 adopted by the District's Board arbitrary,

10 capricious, not supported by the record, and a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

11 17. In accordance with the above and as supported by each cause of action below,

12 Petitioner/Plaintiff seeks a determination from this Court that:

13 a. The District's reliance on the 2018 EIR for the Rule 6-5 Amendment as indicated

14 in the Final Staff Report, adopting Resolution, and Notice of Determination

15 ("NOD") filed on August 9, 2021, was unlawful, null, void, and unenforceable.

16 b. The Rule 6-5 Amendment, and the District's promulgation of that amendment,

17 are invalid and void for failing to satisfy the requirements of CEQA.

18 C. The Rule 6-5 Amendment is invalid and void because the District failed to

19 comply with the H&S Code, including without limitation Sections 40606,

20 40920.6, 40703, 40728.5, and 40727.

21 d. The Rule 6-5 Amendment is invalid and void because it is arbitrary, capricious,

22 and lacks adequate basis in the record.

23 18. For the foregoing reasons, Petitioner/Plaintiff ask this Court to issue a writ of

24 mandate requiring the District to vacate and rescind the Rule 6-5 Amendment or grant such other

25 relief as the Court deems just and proper.

26 19. Petitioner/Plaintiff also asks this Court for declaratory relief and judgment against

27 the District (i) declaring that the Rule 6-5 Amendment is arbitrary, capricious, and lacks adequate

28 basis in the record; (ii) declaring that the District's promulgation of the Rule 6-5 Amendment

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

violates H&S Code §§ 40703, 40920.6, 40606, 40728.5, and 40727; (iii) declaring that the

2 District's promulgation of the Rule 6-5 Amendment is ultra vires; and (iv) in the form of any other

3 declaratory relief the Court deems just and proper.

4 20. Petitioner/Plaintiff further seeks injunctive relief and ask this Court to enjoin the

5 District from enforcing any of the requirements contained in the Rule 6-5 Amendment.

6 PARTIES

7 21. Petitioner/Plaintiff MRC operates the Refinery that is regulated by the District and

8 subject to Rule 6-5 and the Rule 6-5 Amendment.

9 22. Respondent/Defendant District is a state Public Agency located in Northern

10 California.

11 23. The District's jurisdiction in regulating air quality for stationary and certain other

12 sources includes Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, Napa, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara

13 Counties, and the southern portions of Solano and Sonoma Counties.

14 24. Petitioner/Plaintiff is unaware of the true names and capacities of

15 Respondents/Defendants identified as Does 1-20, and sue such Respondents/Defendants herein by

16 fictitious names. Petitioner/Plaintiff upon information and belief allege that

17 Respondents/Defendants Does 1-20 are also responsible, in whole or in part, for the invalid and

18 unlawful approval of the Rule 6-5 Amendment and the failure to comply with required rulemaking

19 procedures and applicable state laws. When the true identities and capacities of these
20 Respondents/Defendants have been determined, Petitioner/Plaintiff will, with leave of the Court if

21 necessary, amend this Petition and Complaint to insert such identities and capacities.

22 REGULATORY & PROCEDURAL HISTORY

23 25. The history in this matter is straightforward and telling.

24 26. The District first adopted an earlier version of Rule 6-5 in 2015. The District made

25 limited amendments to that rule in 2018. These initial versions of Rule 6-5 imposed certain
26 requirements on FCCUs related to ammonia emissions but did not contain emissions limitations for

27 sulfur dioxide ("SO2") or TPM.

28 27. In July 2017, California enacted legislation known as "AB 617."

7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

28. Among other things, AB 617 required California air districts in nonattainment areas

2 to "adopt an expedited schedule for the implementation of best available retrofit control

3 technology" (generally referred to as BARCT) for certain equipment and sources to address
4 nonattainment pollutants in that area. (H&S Code § 40920.6(c).) Air districts were required to

5 adopt such schedules on or before January 1, 2019, and to implement the schedule by December 31,

6 2023. (Id.)

7 29. Recognizing the difficulty in requiring retrofits on equipment located at thousands of

8 facilities throughout California to address nonattainment pollutants, and the associated

9 socioeconomic impacts, the California Legislature also required air districts to undertake a series of

10 steps when establishing emission control options constituting BARCT for certain equipment and

11 sources. Districts are required to identify emission control options and to assess both cost-

12 effectiveness (as defined by AB 617) and calculate incremental cost-effectiveness (again as defined

13 by AB 617). (H&S Code § 40920.6(a)).

14 30. In December 2018, the District's Board adopted the District's "AB 617 Expedited

15 Best Available Retrofit Control Technology Implementation Schedule" (referred to hereafter as

16 "AB 617 Expedited BARCT Implementation Schedule").

17 31. Also in December 2018, the District adopted the 2018 EIR in support of the AB 617

18 Expedited BARCT Implementation Schedule.

19 a. The purpose of the 2018 EIR was to "address the potential environmental

20 impacts associated with the Expedited BARCT Implementation Schedule," while

21 the defined CEQA "project" was "to implement [six] rule development projects."

22 b. The 2018 EIR acknowledges that "the degree of specificity required in an EIR

23 corresponds to the degree of specificity involved in the underlying activity

24 described in the EIR.'

25 c. The 2018 EIR did not-and could not have adequately consider all project

26 alternatives and impacts considered and related to the development of BARCT

27 requirements for refineries in the rulemaking process for the Rule 6-5

28 Amendment.

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

d. The District staff expressly acknowledged this issue and promised to the

2 public- -and to the District's Board, prior to its adoption of the 2018 EIR-that

3 there would be a separate CEQA analysis for each individual BARCT rule

4 brought forward for consideration and eventual adoption. The District breached

5 that promise.

6 32. The District first released draft amendments to Rule 6-5 and an Initial Staff Report in

7 May 2020. The District revised these proposals through 2020 pursuant to District meetings,

8 workshops, and the collection of public comments.

9 33. In January 2021, the District released two versions of draft amendments to Rule 6-5

10 and held a workshop reflecting two alternative control options then under consideration by the

11 District: Control Option A (with a 0.02 gr/dscf TPM standard, MRC's alternative proposal) and

12 Control Option B (with a 0.01 gr/dscf TPM standard).

13 34. The District released its proposed Rule 6-5 Amendment and Draft Staff Report on

14 March 30, 2021 and sought public comments through April 30, 2021. But this proposed

15 amendment reflected only Control Option B, with its corresponding 0.01 gr/dscf TPM standard,

16 limiting the options considered for adoption by the District's Board.

17 35. The District issued its Final Staff Report for the Rule 6-5 Amendment in May 2021.

18 That document-in only half a page- relies exclusively on the 2018 EIR for compliance with

19 CEQA and does not purport to conduct any independent or updated CEQA analysis with respect to

20 the Rule 6-5 Amendment. This action is contrary to the District's prior public assurances that each

21 new BARCT rule would be accompanied by a new and individualized CEQA analysis.

22 36. Throughout the rulemaking process, MRC and other refineries submitted numerous

23 written and oral comments to the District documenting points of legal and technical concern,

24 especially the lack of a proper CEQA analysis for the proposed rule amendments. In particular,

25 MRC submitted written comments on July 13, 2020, April 29, 2021, April 30, 2021, May 18, 2021,

26 June 1, 2021, and July 20, 2021.

27 37. On May 25, 2021, the District released a "Summary of Comments and Response on

28 the Regulatory Package for Proposed Amendments to Regulation 6, Rule 5: Particulate Emissions

9

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

from Refinery Fluidized Catalytic Cracking Units." This document purports to respond to

2 comments but does not adequately address the important technical and legal issues raised during the

3 rulemaking process by MRC and others.

4 38. A public hearing on the Rule 6-5 Amendment was held on June 2, 2021. After hours

5 of debate regarding the contents and appropriateness of the Rule 6-5 Amendment, that hearing was

6 continued until July 21, 2021.

7 39. At a public hearing held on July 21, 2021, the District's Board voted to adopt the

8 Rule 6-5 Amendment, relying on the 2018 EIR for CEQA, and approved the District's related

9 Resolution No. 2021-10.

10 40. The District posted a NOD for the Rule 6-5 Amendment in Solano County on

11 August 9, 2021. The NOD expressly relies exclusively on the 2018 EIR for the District's

12 compliance with CEQA when adopting the Rule 6-5 Amendment.

13 41. The District failed to comply with California law when it adopted the Rule 6-5

14 Amendment.

15 42. Petitioner/Plaintiff timely filed this Petition and Complaint on September 7, 2021.

16 43. For the Petitioner/Plaintiff, this Petition is deemed verified. (Code of Civ. Proc.

17 § 446.).

18 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

19 44. This action arises under the following laws:

20 a. CEQA and its implementing regulations, Pub. Resources Code § 21000 et seq.;

21 Cal. Code Regs., title 14, § 15000 et seq. (also referred to herein as the CEQA

22 Guidelines);

23 b. The H&S Code, including without limitation H&S Code § § 40606, 40728.5,

24 40703, 40727, 40920.6, and 40922;

25 c. AB 617 and H&S Code provisions implementing the BARCT provisions of that

26 law, inclusive of H&S Code § 40920.6; and

27 d. California common law.

28

10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

45. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition and Complaint

2 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §§ 1085, 1094.5, and 1060; and Public Resources Code §§

3 21168 and 21168.5.

4 46. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 394(a).

5 47. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure 388, Petitioner/Plaintiff is serving the

6 California Attorney General with a copy of this Petition. Additionally, consistent with Public

7 Resources Code § 21167.5, Petitioner/Plaintiff has served the District with notice of this Petition

8 and Complaint. A true and correct copy of that notice is attached as Exhibit 1.

9 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

10 48. Petitioner/Plaintiff has performed all conditions precedent to filing this action.

11 Petitioner/Plaintiff actively participated in the rulemaking process, submitted numerous and

12 voluminous written comments in a timely manner, and provided oral comments at the District's

13 publicly held meetings.

14 49. Petitioner/Plaintiff will comply with Public Resources Code § 21167.6 by timely

15 filing a request concerning the preparation of the record of administrative proceedings relating to

16 the Rule 6-5 Amendment.

17 50. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of

18 law unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondent/Defendant to set

19 aside the District's approval of the Rule 6-5 Amendment for: (1) failing to comply with CEQA; (2)

20 failing to comply with the H&S Code and other applicable laws; and (3) because the Rule 6-5

21 Amendment is ultra vires, arbitrary, and/or capricious.

22 51. Petitioner/Plaintiff brought this action within 30 days of the District's posting of the

23 NOD. (See Public Resources Code § 21167.)

24 STANDING

25 52. MRC has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition/Complaint because the

26 adopted Rule 6-5 Amendment applies to MRC. MRC owns and operates the Refinery that is within

27 the geographic territory regulated by the District and is subject to the District's rules and

28 regulations, including the Rule 6-5 Amendment.

11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

53. MRC's environmental, economic, and/or beneficial interests are directly and

2 adversely affected by the District's adoption of the Rule 6-5 Amendment.

3 54. MRC will sustain direct harm and injury-in-fact as a result of the District's BARCT
4 determination and the Rule 6-5 Amendment's 0.01 gr/dscf TPM emissions limitation, which will

5 cause a direct, immediate, and significant adverse impact on the Refinery's operations and business.

6 That injury is imminent because the Rule 6-5 Amendment is now final; as a result, refineries

7 subject to the rule will need to begin taking measures immediately to prepare to comply with new

8 emissions requirements contained in the Rule 6-5 Amendment, particularly the 0.01 gr/dscf TPM

9 standard.

10 55. This Court has the power to remedy the harm and injury caused by the District's

11 actions by granting MRC the relief requested herein.

12 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

13 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act)

14 56. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth

15 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1-55, inclusive.

16 57. Petitioner/Plaintiff bring this First Cause of Action pursuant to Public Resources

17 Code § 21168 and § 21168.5, on the grounds that the District failed to act in accordance with the

18 law and committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, in that it considered and approved

19 regulations/rules without undertaking an analysis of the potential environmental impacts as required

20 by CEQA.

21 58. The District is a "Public Agency" within the meaning of CEQA. (Pub. Res. Code

22 21063; CEQA Guidelines § 15383.) CEQA requires public agencies to conduct environmental

23 reviews prior to approving any discretionary project that may have a significant impact on the

24 environment. The District's approval of the Rule 6-5 Amendment is a discretionary approval.

25 59. Under CEQA, "project" means "the whole of an action, which has the potential for

26 resulting in either a direct physical a change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect

27 physical change in the environment." (CEQA Guidelines 15378(a).)

28 60. The District's approval of the Rule 6-5 Amendment constitutes a "project" within

12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

the meaning of CEQA. CEQA requires that all cumulative impacts related to the project must be

2 analyzed together. (CEQA Guidelines § 15130.)

3 61. "Approval" of a project means "the decision by a public agency which commits the

4 agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project intended to be carried out by any person.'

5 (CEQA Guidelines § 15352.) The District's actions related to its adoption of the Rule 6-5

6 Amendment constitute an "approval" within the meaning of CEQA.

7 62. Compliance with the procedural requirements of CEQA informs the public of the

8 proposed project and aids in identifying project alternatives and mitigation measures. These

9 procedural requirements (and the project alternatives and mitigation measures they identify) further

10 CEQA's purpose of reducing the potential for either a direct or a reasonably foreseeable a indirect

11 physical change in the environment.

12 63. Without a proper procedural foundation, a public agency cannot comply with

13 CEQA's mandate to approve projects as proposed only if there are no feasible alternatives or

14 feasible mitigation measures available which would substantially lessen the significant
15  environmental effects of such projects. (Pub. Res. Code § 21002.)

16 64. Whenever there is a fair argument based on substantial evidence that a project may

17 have a significant impact on the environment, the lead agency must prepare an EIR. (Pub. Res.

18 Code, §§ 21100 [state agencies], 21151 [local agencies].)

19 65. The Rule 6-5 Amendment has the potential to result in a direct or reasonably

20 foreseeable indirect significant effect on the environment. Substantial evidence in the record shows

21 that the Rule 6-5 Amendment may result in significant environmental impacts from the District's

22 BARCT determination and the installation and operation of controls likely required to achieve the

23 0.01 gr/dscf TPM standard in the Rule 6-5 Amendment. CEQA requires the District to analyze all

24 direct, indirect and cumulative impacts arising from the whole of a given action. (See CEQA

25 Guidelines § 15126.2(a).) To fulfill this mandate, the District is obligated to consider "all phases of

26 project" including "planning, acquisition, development, and operation.' (CEQA Guidelines §

27 15126.) The District committed prejudicial abuse of discretion and violated CEQA when it failed

28 to conduct an adequate investigation and mitigate the significant environmental impacts of the Rule

13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

6-5 Amendment associated with the District's BARCT determination and the 0.01 gr/dscf TPM

2 standard. If a WGS was installed at MRC's Refinery, as contemplated by the District's action, that

3 WGS alone would result in the following unanalyzed/inadequately analyzed or unmitigated

4 impacts, among others:

5 a. Increased water consumption by 250,000,000 gallons per year (enough to serve

6 7,000 people) in already drought-stricken California;

7 b. A 10,000 metric ton increase in greenhouse gas emissions;

8 C. An increase in electricity (22,000 megawatt hours) consumption;

9 d. An increase in natural gas consumption (200,000,000 standard cubic feet)
10 consumption;
11 e. A 500,000 gallon per year increase in the generation of hazardous materials;

12 f. An 800,000 pound per year increase in the generation of hazardous waste;

13 g. Significant increases in construction and operational air pollutant emissions,

14 including greenhouse gases;

15 h. Wastewater treatment and wastewater discharges into the Carquinez Straits (250

16 gallons per minute of wastewater, which would potentially require upgrades to

17 the Refinery's wastewater treatment plant to ensure adequate wastewater

18 treatment capacity);

19 i. Impacts to visual resources from the generation of plumes; and

20 j. The cumulative impact of all these impacts at MRC's Refinery and every other

21 refinery in the Bay Area Air Basin.

22 66. The District has not prepared an EIR for the Rule 6-5 Amendment project, violating

23 CEQA and depriving the public and decision-makers of critical information regarding the adoption

24 of the Rule 6-5 Amendment. In fact, the District did not engage in any substantive environmental

25 review under CEQA related specifically to the adoption of the Rule 6-5 Amendment, dedicating

26 only half of a page in its Final Staff Report to the topic.
27 67. Instead, despite assurances made in December 2018, the District relies exclusively

28 on the 2018 EIR related to its adoption of the AB 617 Expedited BARCT Implementation Schedule.

14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

The 2018 EIR did not analyze (or did not analyze sufficiently) the impacts of the Rule 6-5

2 Amendment. The District cannot rely solely on the 2018 EIR to comply with CEQA for its

3 adoption of the Rule 6-5 Amendment.

4 68. The 2018 EIR is what CEQA refers to a as a "Program" EIR. A Program EIR is

5 "prepared and certified for a program, plan, policy, or ordinance," and CEQA requires that the lead

6 agency "examine significant effects of the later project upon the environment by using a tiered

7 environmental impact report." (Pub. Res. Code § 21094(a).) In this instance, the 2018 AB 617

8 Expedited BARCT Implementation Schedule is obviously a "program, plan, policy or ordinance" as

9 it was intended to cover six District future rulemakings; the Rule 6-5 Amendment is one of these

10 future rulemakingsa "later project" for CEQA purposes.

11 69. When using a Program EIR for CEQA purposes, the lead agency is required to

12 conduct an initial study to determine whether the later project "may cause significant effects on the

13 environment that were not examined in the prior environmental impact report." (Pub. Res. Code con

14 21094(c).) The District did not conduct an initial study to determine whether the Rule 6-5

15 Amendment may have a significant effect on the environment. The Rule 6-5 Amendment was not

16 analyzed in the 2018 EIR. This alone violates CEQA, and for good reason-the District's failure to

17 conduct the initial study resulted in it ignoring the substantial environmental effects that will result

18 from the Rule 6-5 Amendment.

19 70. In an effort to avoid its regulatory obligations under CEQA to use a Program EIR,

20 the District instead has disingenuously asserted that the 2018 EIR, alone was sufficient to justify the

21 adoption of the Rule 6-5 Amendment, and cited to Public Resources Code § 21166 as support for

22 this justification. But even if that section applied, which it does not, the District's failure to provide

23 any sort of supplemental or subsequent environmental review for the Rule 6-5 Amendment violates

24 CEQA.

25 71. The District is required to prepare a subsequent EIR or supplemental EIR for the

26 same project when substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the

27 project is undertaken that will require major revisions of the previous EIR due to the involvement of

28 new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously

15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

identified significant effects. (Pub. Res. Code § 21166; CEQA Guidelines §§ 15162(a)(2),

2 15162(b), and 15163.)

3 72. As an example of the District's failure to analyze "new significant environmental

4 effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects" related to

5 the Rule 6-5 Amendment, in March 2021, the California Department of Water Resources lowered

6 its forecast of the deliveries it expects to make to cities and farms that belong to the State Water

7 Project to just 5% of contracted deliveries.

8 73. On April 21, 2021, Governor Gavin Newson declared a Regional Drought

9 Emergency that included the portion of Sonoma County that is within the District's jurisdiction, and

10 stated that "California is facing the familiar reality of drought conditions .. .. This 'new normal'

11 gives urgency to building drought resilience in regions across the state and preparing for what may

12 be a prolonged drought at our doorstep." Governor Newsom followed this with Executive Order N-

13 10-21, executed on July 8, 2021, calling on all Californians to reduce their water usage by 15%

14 from 2020 levels to "preserve the State's surface and groundwater supplies and better prepare for

15 the potential for continued dry conditions next year" because, among other things, "severe drought

16 afflicts the American West and increasingly warming temperatures driven by climate change

17 exacerbate harmful drought effects including disruption of drinking water and irrigation supplies,

18 degradation of fish and wildlife habitat, and heightened flammability of wildland vegetation."

19 74. Given the considerable amount of water needed to operate a WGS as BARCT at

20 each of the Bay Area's impacted refineries, the Governor's drought declarations and recent efforts

21 by California and Federal agencies to conserve water show that substantial changes have occurred

22 with respect to the circumstances under which the Rule 6-5 Amendment project is undertaken. This

23 "new normal" drastically increases the severity of any water consumption impacts contemplated by

24 the 2018 EIR and CEQA requires that the District prepare a subsequent EIR to analyze such

25 impacts.

26 75. The District is required to prepare a subsequent EIR for the same project when new

27 information of substantial importance, which was not known and could not have been known with

28 the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the previous EIR was certified as complete, shows

16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

that mitigation measures or alternatives which are considerably different from those analyzed in the

2 previous EIR, would substantially reduce one or more significant effects on the environment, but

3 the project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative. (Pub. Res. Code §

4 21166; CEQA Guidelines § § 15162(a)(3)(D), 15162(b), and 15163.) The 2018 EIR only analyzed

5 two alternatives: either not adopting the AB 617 Expedited BARCT Implementation Schedule or

6 delaying implementation of the schedule. Alternatives with respect to each rule, including the Rule

7 6-5 Amendment, were never analyzed or taken into account in the 2018 EIR. The Rule 6-5

8 Amendment adopts a 0.01 gr/dscf TPM standard but MRC's alternative TPM emission proposal

9 (0.02 gr/dscf TPM standard) initially contemplated by District staff, was not proposed and

10 considered by the District until after the 2018 EIR was certified. MRC's alternative proposal-

11 which would not result in the massive amounts of water consumption, energy use, greenhouse gas

12 and other emissions, wastewater and hazardous waste generation, and visual impairment from

13 plumeswas never considered under CEQA specifically for the Rule 6-5 Amendment. Rather,

14 MRC's alternative proposal was improperly removed from consideration and never analyzed in the

15 District's CEQA analysis for the Draft Rule Amendment. The failure to analyze such a project
16 alternative, particularly if it could be the environmentally superior alternative, violates CEQA and

17 requires that the District prepare a subsequent EIR to the 2018 EIR, or at the very least, a

18 supplemental environmental document. (CEQA Guidelines § § 15162(a)(3)(D), 15163.)

19 76. Major revisions will be required to the 2018 EIR to make its analysis adequate for

20 adoption of the Rule 6-5 Amendment. Nearly every environmental resource area analyzed in the

21 2018 EIR will need to be updated and revised. An analysis of the difference between the 0.01

22 gr/dscf and 0.02 gr/dscf TPM standard alternatives, which were never analyzed or compared in the

23 2018 EIR or in any other CEQA document, will need to be conducted. Absent these analyses, the

24 decision-makers (the District Board) and the public will be deprived of meaningful information

25 regarding the environmental impacts of the Rule 6-5 Amendment, in violation of CEQA.

26 77. For the reasons stated above, the District's adoption of the Rule 6-5 Amendment

27 failed to comply with CEQA. The Rule 6-5 Amendment will have significant adverse

28 environmental, economic, operational, and other impacts on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff

17

has no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for this harm and seek appropriate relief

2 through this Petition and Complaint.

3 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

4 (Violation of California Health and Safety Code 40703)

5 78. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth

6 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1-77, inclusive.

7 79. H&S Code § 40703 requires that, in adopting any regulation, the District must

8 "consider, pursuant to Section 40922, and make available to the public, its findings related to the

9 cost effectiveness of a control measure, as well as the basis for the findings and the considerations

10 involved. A district shall make reasonable efforts, to the extent feasible within existing budget

11 constraints, to make specific reference to the direct costs expected to be incurred by regulated

12 parties, including businesses and individuals."

13 80. The District did not meaningfully consider cost-effectiveness when adopting the

14 Rule 6-5 Amendment.

15 81. The Rule 6-5 Amendment is the costliest rule in the District's history, while

16 targeting a small fraction of Bay Area TPM emissions.

17 82. The District purposefully ignored valid and real-world cost data submitted by MRC

18 and other refineries subject to the rule in order to downplay the actual cost and over-inflate the

19 benefits of the Rule 6-5 Amendment.

20 83. The District dramatically and purposefully underestimates the cost of its BARCT

21 determination in California to meet the 0.01 gr/dscf TPM standard.

22 84. The District's cost estimates are simply wrong, and the District has failed to explain

23 why it disagrees with the valid and real-world cost estimates presented by MRC and other

24 commenters during the rulemaking process.

25 85. The District's own data also show that the Rule 6-5 Amendment is not economically

26 feasible or cost-effective by any rational measure, with cost-effectiveness values dramatically out of

27 line with prior District rulemaking determinations.

28

18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

a. The District fails to identify any comparable rules in terms of cost-effectiveness;

2 the District has not identified any regulatory precedents because there are none.

3 b. The District's assessments of "reasonable" TPM and SO2 control costs for prior

4 rules it has adopted illustrate why the TPM cost-effectiveness for Control

5 Scenario B (0.01 gr/dscf TPM standard) and the Rue 6-5 Amendment as adopted

6 are arbitrary and irrational.

7 86. The District further failed to meaningfully account for the significant costs regarding

8 the Rule 6-5 Amendment as applied to MRC (e.g., lack of physical space at the Refinery associated

9 with the District's BARCT determination).

10 87. The District failed to explain how cost-effectiveness influenced its decision to

11 finalize the Rule 6-5 Amendment based on Control Scenario B (0.01 gr/dscf TPM standard), rather

12 than Control Scenario A (0.02 gr/dscf TPM standard), notwithstanding that Control Scenario A

13 would achieve similar air quality benefits at dramatically lower costs.

14 88. The District did not explain why it believes the control costs of the Rule 6-5

15 Amendment are at all compatible with reasoned decision-making.

16 89. By any reasonable standard, the Rule 6-5 Amendment is not cost-effective.

17 90. By failing to conduct an accurate, thorough, unbiased, and otherwise appropriate
18 cost-effectiveness analysis for the Rule 6-5 Amendment, the District violated H&S Code § 40703.

19 That violation harms Petitioner/Plaintiff because the Rule 6-5 Amendment will have significant

20 adverse environmental, economic, operational, and other impacts on Petitioner/Plaintiff.

21 Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for this harm and seek

22 appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

23 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

24 (Violations of Health & Safety Code § 40920.6)

25 91. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth

26 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1-90, inclusive.

27 92. When adopting AB 617 and H&S Code § 40920.6, the State Legislature required

28 additional cost considerations in order to ensure reasoned decision-making and to constrain BARCT

19
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

to standards that were actually achievable.

2 93. Importantly, the Legislature mandated consideration of both cost-effectiveness, as

3 defined by H&S Code 40920.6 and consideration of "incremental cost-effectiveness for the

4 potential control options" as further efined by H&S Code § 40920.6.

5 94. With respect to cost considerations and cost-effectiveness, the District has violated

6 H&S Code con 40920.6 for the same reasons Plaintiff alleges the District has violated H&S § 40703.

7 95. The District also has violated H&S Code § 40920.6 in numerous additional ways,

8 including:

9 a. The District has not reasonably considered the factors prescribed by H&S Code
10 40920.6;

11 b. The District has not meaningfully assessed or considered the cost-effectiveness

12 of potential emission control options;

13 C. The District has not meaningfully assessed or considered the incremental cost-

14 effectiveness of potential emission control options; and

15 d. The District has failed to make reasoned findings in the record supported by

16 substantial evidence regarding both cost-effectiveness and incremental cost-

17 effectiveness of the control options considered.

18 96. These failures are especially pronounced given the vast difference in costs and the

19 relatively limited difference in environmental benefit when comparing the two emission control

20 options initially considered by the District, with only one option (0.01 gr/dscf TPM standard)

21 presented to the District Board for consideration and eventual adoption.

22 97. The District's failures to meaningfully provide reasoning supported by substantial

23 evidence regarding cost-effectiveness and incremental cost-effectiveness violates the Legislature's

24 express commands to carefully consider cost-effectiveness and incremental cost-effectiveness when

25 imposing BARCT controls pursuant to AB 617 and H&S Code § 40920.6.

26 98. For these and other reasons stated above, the District's adoption of the Rule 6-5

27 Amendment violated H&S Code 40920.6. As amended, Rule 6-5 will have significant adverse

28 environmental, economic, operational, and other impacts on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff

20
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

have no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for this harm and seek appropriate relief

2 through this Petition and Complaint.

3 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

4 (Violations of Health & Safety Code § 40406)

5 99. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth

6 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1-98, inclusive.

7 100. H&S Code § 40406 defines BARCT.

8 101. The District has not reasonably considered the factors prescribed by this statute,

9 including the rule's environmental, energy, and economic impacts.

10 102. These failings are for the same reasons as describe above, most particularly, but not

11 exclusively, with respect to:

12 a. The lack of cost-effectiveness of the Rule 6-5 Amendment and the District's

13 BARCT determination, resulting in significant adverse cost, operational, and

14 business impacts to regulated refineries;

15 b. The massive and unmitigated fresh water use; generation of massive amounts of

16 greenhouse gases, wastewater, and hazardous materials; and significant

17 aesthetics impacts that the District's identified control option for complying with

18 the Rule 6-5 Amendment would require; and

19 C. The lack of "achievability" to meet the 0.01 gr/dscf TPM standard set by the

20 Rule 6-5 Amendment based on the District's BARCT determination.

21 103. In addition, the very definition of BARCT contained in H&S Code § 40406 requires

22 that it is "achievable."

23 104. For MRC, the Rule 6-5 Amendment and the District's purported BARCT
24 determination to meet the 0.01 gr/dscf TPM standard would not be "achievable" given the lack of

25 available space at MRC's Refinery for new the installation of new emissions controls.

26 105. Data submitted by the Western States Petroleum Association and other commenters

27 during the Rule 6-5 Amendment rulemaking process, as well as the District's own documents,

28

21
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

clearly demonstrate that WGSs-the technology the District relied on to establish the 0.01 gr/dscf

2 TPM standarddo not consistently achieve the 0.01 gr/dscfTPM standard (at 5% oxygen).

3 106. This not only undermines the validity of the District's analysis, BARCT

4 determination, and the 0.01 gr/dscf TPM standard of the Rule 6-5 Amendment, but directly

5 contradicts the command of H&S Code § 40406 that BARCT standards must be "achievable."

6 107. These failures have resulted in a standard that is not the "best achievable retrofit

7 control technology," BARCT, as that term is defined in H&S Code 8 40406.

8 108. For these and other reasons stated above, the District's adoption of the Rule 6-5

9 Amendment violated H&S Code § 40406. As amended, Rule 6-5 will have significant adverse

10 environmental, economic, operational, and other impacts on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff

11 has no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for this harm and seeks appropriate relief

12 through this Petition and Complaint.

13 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

14 (The District's Adoption of Rule 6-5 is Arbitrary, Capricious, and Lacking in Adequate Evidentiary Support)

15 109. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth

16 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1-108, inclusive.

17 110. District actions that are arbitrary, capricious, entirely lacking in evidentiary support,

18 unlawful, or procedurally unfair are a prejudicial abuse of discretion, illegal, and void.

19 111. The District's adoption of the Rule 6-5 Amendment itself was demonstrably

20 arbitrary, capricious, entirely lacking in evidentiary support, unlawful, and procedurally unfair.

21 112. Numerous actions and omissions during the rulemaking process highlight the

22 arbitrary and capricious nature of the District Board's decision to adopt the Rule 6-5 Amendment,

23 as well as the lack of evidentiary support in the record on many key issues. These include, without

24 limitation, the following:

25 a. The District pre-determined that it would regulate TPM from FCCUs, despite the

26 costs being "unknown.'

27 b. The District used flawed and inaccurate data in its cost-effectiveness analysis.

28 C. The District failed to meaningfully explain how it considered cost-effectiveness.

22
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

d. The District failed to meaningfully explain how it considered incremental cost-

2 effectiveness.

3 e. The District failed to meaningfully explain the enormous discrepancy in cost-

4 effectiveness between the Rule 6-5 Amendment (under both

5 Petitioner's/Plaintiff's valid and real-world estimates, and the District's own

6 understated estimates), and the cost-effectiveness of any other District rule

7 targeting the same air pollutants.

8 f. Despite SO2 generally being more expensive to control on a per-ton basis, the

9 District failed to meaningfully explain why it is appropriate to require more
10 expensive controls for TPM than for SO2 on a per-ton basis.
11 g. The District's dismissal of the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on

12 the refinery sector is without basis in the record.

13 h. The District fails to adequately explain why it has finalized the Rule 6-5

14 Amendment under Control Scenario B (0.01 grain/dscf TPM standard) versus

15 Control Scenario A (MRC's alternative TPM reduction proposal, a 0.02

16 grain/dscf TPM standard).

17 i. The two standards are similar when it comes to reductions in ambient

18 particulate matter concentrations, but worlds apart when it comes to all

19 measures of achievability, technical feasibility, cost-effectiveness,

20 environmental impacts (i.e., water resource usage), and socioeconomic

21 impacts.

22 ii. The District's distinctions between Control Scenario A (0.02 grain/dscf

23 TPM standard) and Control Scenario B (0.01 grain/dscf TPM standard)

24 are arbitrary and lacking evidentiary support.

25 iii. The District's distinctions between Control Scenario A (0.02 grain/dscf

26 TPM standard) and Control Scenario B (0.01 grain/dscf TPM standard)

27 are not supported by the record.

28

23
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

i. The District has grossly overestimated emission reductions and environmental

2 benefits from the Rule 6-5 Amendment in a manner a not supported by the record.

3 j. The District has exaggerated and misstated the anticipated health benefits of the

4 Rule 6-5 Amendment.

5 k. The Rule 6-5 Amendment would reduce particulate matter by a small fraction in

6 the Bay Area, while at the same time imposing significant costs on impacted

7 refineries, something the District has purposely glossed over in the record.

8 I. The District's health-effects analysis fails to account for the fact that most TPM

9 being controlled by the Rule 6-5 Amendment would be sulfate.

10 113. The District has failed to meaningfully respond to comments from MRC and others

11 with respect to these and the other vital matters raised in this Petition and Complaint during the

12 Rule 6-5 Amendment rulemaking process.

13 114. The District's adoption of the Rule 6-5 Amendment is arbitrary, capricious and not

14 supported by evidence in the record. Those actions harm Petitioner/Plaintiff because Rule 6-5 will

15 have significant adverse environmental, economic, operational, and other impacts on

16 Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for this

17 harm and seeks appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

18 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

19 (The Implementation Timeline for Rule 6-5 Is Arbitrary, Capricious, and Lacking in
Adequate Evidentiary Support)
20 115. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth
21 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1-114, inclusive.
22 116. District actions that are arbitrary, capricious, entirely lacking in evidentiary support,
23 unlawful, or procedurally unfair are a prejudicial abuse of discretion, illegal, and void.
24 117. The District's adoption of an infeasible five-year timeframe for implementation of
25 the Rule 6-5 Amendment is arbitrary, capricious, entirely lacking in evidentiary support, unlawful,
26 and procedurally unfair.
27

28

24
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

118. The District has adopted a timeline for implementation that fails to account for the

2 time necessary for design, engineering, procurement, fabrication, delivery, construction, testing,

3 and other logistics to comply with the Rule 6-5 Amendment's 0.01 gr/dscf TPM standard.

4 119. The District has failed to meaningfully respond to comments from MRC and others

5 regarding the issues in the preceding paragraph, especially MRC's comment that the District's

6 BARCT determination is not physically feasible at MRC's Refinery due to space constraints.

7 120. By failing to adopt a reasonable timeline for implementation, the District has

8 effectively adopted a rule with costs higher than those estimated by the District while imposing

9 requirements that are unachievable in practice.

10 121. The District's adoption of the Rule 6-5 Amendment implementation timeframe is

11 arbitrary, capricious and not supported by evidence in the record. Those actions harm

12 Petitioner/Plaintiff because the Rule 6-5 Amendment will have significant adverse environmental,

13 economic, operational, and other impacts on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other

14 plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for this harm and seeks appropriate relief through this

15 Petition and Complaint.

16 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

17 (The District's Imposition of Requirements That Are Unachievable is Arbitrary, Capricious, and Lacking in Adequate Evidentiary Support)
18 122. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth
19 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1-121, inclusive.
20 123. District actions that are arbitrary, capricious, entirely lacking in evidentiary support,
21 unlawful, or procedurally unfair are a prejudicial abuse of discretion, illegal, and void.
22 124. The District's adoption of the Rule 6-5 Amendment itself was demonstrably
23 arbitrary, capricious, entirely lacking in evidentiary support, unlawful, and procedurally unfair.
24 125. The District also has failed to meaningfully address the space constraints at

25 Petitioner's/Plaintiff's Refinery related to the District's BARCT determination that make meeting

26 the 0.01 gr/dscf TPM standard technically infeasible.
27 126. MRC presented the District with detailed and voluminous comments and other
28 substantive information during the rulemaking process demonstrating that it was impossible to meet

25
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

the 0.01 gr/dscf TPM standard for the District's BARCT determination due to a lack of physical

2 space at MRC's Refinery.

3 127. The District repeatedly brushed these concerns aside, stating merely that it

4 "believes" Petitioner/Plaintiff could rearrange the facility, but without any reasoned analysis or

5 basis in the record to support the District's actions. The District has failed to meaningfully respond

6 to MRC's comments to the contrary.

7 128. The lack of space at the Refinery to accommodate the technology that forms the

8 basis of the District's BARCT determination means that MRC cannot comply with the Rule 6-5

9 Amendment's 0.01 grain/dscf TPM standard in the manner contemplated by the District's analysis.

10 129. The District failed to meaningfully respond to comments regarding infeasibility at
11 Petitioner's/Plaintiff's Refinery and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner when it adopted the

12 0.01 gr/dscf TMP standard that cannot be achieved in the manner contemplated by the District's

13 analysis.

14 130. The District also has arbitrarily ignored comments regarding the efficacy of its

15 BARCT determination, and has failed to provide a meaningful and reasoned analysis and response

16 regarding emission control efficacy and the achievability in practice of the Rule 6-5 Amendment

17 0.01 grain/dscf TPM standard.

18 131. The District's adoption of the Rule 6-5 Amendment with a 0.01 grain/dscf TPM

19 standard is arbitrary, capricious and not supported by evidence in the record. Those actions harm
20 Petitioner/Plaintiff because the Rule 6-5 Amendment will have significant adverse environmental,

21 economic, operational, and other impacts on Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other

22 plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for this harm and seeks appropriate relief through this

23 Petition and Complaint.

24 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

25 (Violation of California Health and Safety Code § 40728.5)

26 132. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-alleges and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth

27 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1-131, inclusive.

28

26
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

133. When adopting or amending air quality rules, H&S Code Section § 40728.5 requires

2 the District to "actively consider the socioeconomic impact of regulations and make a good faith

3 effort to minimize adverse socioeconomic impacts."

4 134. The District must comply with specific statutory factors when undertaking this

5 assessment, as detailed by H&S Code Section § 40728.5.b.

6 135. The District has not made "good faith efforts" to minimize socioeconomic impacts

7 when adopting the Rule 6-5 Amendment.

8 136. The Rule 6-5 Amendment will cause significant financial impacts on Bay Area

9 refineries, severely impacting the local economy and creating significant adverse socioeconomic

10 impacts.

11 137. At the same time, another alternative was available before the District that would

12 achieve similar air quality benefits without creating such dramatic socioeconomic impacts.

13 138. Despite H&S Code Section § 40728.5 requiring the District and its Board to "make a

14 good faith effort to minimize adverse socioeconomic impacts," and the District's acknowledgment

15 made any of the significant socioeconomic impacts of the Rule 6-5 Amendment, the District has not

16 "good faith" efforts to minimize those impacts. In fact, the District's failure to consider alternative

17 emissions standards that would avoid such impacts evidences the District's disregard for its

18 statutory obligation to both "actively consider" and "minimize" socioeconomic impacts.

19 139. The District has ignored the intent of H&S Code Section § 40728.5, as well as the

20 comments from numerous citizens and employees who worry about job losses and other

21 socioeconomic impacts resulting from the Rule 6-5 Amendment.

22 140. The District's adoption of the Rule 6-5 Amendment violates H&S Code Section

23 § 40728.5. This action harms Petitioner/Plaintiff because the Rule 6-5 Amendment will have

24 significant adverse environmental, economic, operational, and other impacts on Petitioner/Plaintiff.

25 Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for this harm and seeks

26 appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.

NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of California Health and Safety Code § 40727)

3 141. Petitioner/Plaintiff re-allege and incorporates by reference, as though fully set forth

4 herein, the allegations contained above in Paragraphs 1-140, inclusive.

5 142. H&S Code § 40727 imposes six specific statutory requirements that must be met

6 before the District can issue new regulations. These six requirements include Necessity, Authority,

7 Clarity, Consistency, Non-Duplication and Reference.

8 143. With respect to the requirement of "Necessity," the H&S Code requires that the

9 "record of the rulemaking" must demonstrate the need for the new regulation with "substantial

10 evidence," which requires that the record of rulemaking contain sufficient objective information and

11 expert opinion based on objective information to support the logical inference of the "need" for the

12 regulation. To demonstrate the "need" for a regulation, the District must make a substantive

13 showing that the regulation is not merely desirable or of potential use, but that the regulation is

14 "necessary" before it can be imposed on the governed.

15 a. The District has not demonstrated a need for the Rule 6-5 Amendment as

16 finalized, nor in comparison to other BARCT control options considered by the

17 District during the Rule 6-5 Amendment rulemaking process, with only one

18 option (0.01 gr/dscf TPM standard) presented to the District Board for adoption.

19 b. The District asserts that the Rule 6-5 Amendment is required by AB 617, but

20 nothing in AB 617 requires the District to impose a certain form of BARCT or a

21 particular level of control. Rather, BARCT selection must comport with

22 statutory factors addressed above, which the District failed to comply with in

23 adopting the Rule 6-5 Amendment.

24 C. The District does not explain in adopting the Rule 6-5 Amendment why it must

25 impose those emission requirements, as opposed to other control options

26 considered.

27

28

28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

144. With respect to the requirement of "Authority," the statute requires that the District

2 identify the provision of law that permits or requires the adoption or amendment of a regulation.

3 The District identified its authority as H&S Code §§ 40000, 40001, 40702, and 40725 40728.5.

4 a. Many of the new regulatory requirements imposed by the Rule 6-5 Amendment,

5 however, are not authorized by the specific provisions that are cited by the

6 District, nor does the District necessarily implement or interpret the cited

7 provisions.

8 b. The District's analyses throughout the Rule 6-5 Amendment rulemaking process

9 are uniformly cursory and do not provide the level of detail required by law.
10 C. The District's assertion of authority fails to mention AB 617 or H&S Code
11 cop 40920.6 as sources of authority for the Rule 6-5 Amendment, despite the

12 District's reliance on its prior BARCT planning process and 2018 CEQA

13 analysis (the 2018 EIR) undertaken in furtherance of those laws.

14 d. This unexplained disconnect-failing to mention AB 617 or H&S Code

15 sop 40920.6 as sources of authority-is problematic and indicates that the District

16 is not aware of its statutory obligations when adopting BARCT requirements.

17 e. The District's failure to identify the statutory provisions it relied on as the legal

18 basis for adopting the Rule 6-5 Amendment deprives Petitioners/Plaintiffs and

19 the public of a full and fair opportunity to evaluate and comment on the District's

20 compliance with the legal requirements of H&S Code § 40727.

21 145. The requirement of "Reference" provides that the District must identify the

22 provision of law that the District implements or interprets when it adopts or amends a regulation.

23 a. The District asserts that the Rule 6-5 Amendment will be implementing,

24 interpreting, or making specific the provisions of H&S Code § § 40000, 40001,

25 40702, and 40727.

26 b. The District's assertion of authority fails to reference that the Rule 6-5

27 Amendment would implement or interpret AB 617 or H&S Code § 40920.6,

28

29
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

despite the District's reliance on its prior BARCT planning process and 2018

2 CEQA analysis (the 2018 EIR) undertaken in furtherance of those laws.

3 146. The District's perfunctory assertions that it has satisfied all six requirements of H&S

4 Code con 40727 in adopting the Rule 6-5 Amendment are arbitrary, capricious and not supported by

5 evidence in the record. Those actions harm Petitioner/Plaintiff because the Rule 6-5 Amendment

6 will have significant adverse environmental, economic, operational, and other impacts on
7 Petitioner/Plaintiff. Petitioner/Plaintiff has no other plain, speedy, or adequate legal remedy for this

8 harm and seeks appropriate relief through this Petition and Complaint.
