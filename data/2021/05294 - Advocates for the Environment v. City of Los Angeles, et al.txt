OONOAWD Petitioner, Advocates for the Environment, alleges:

Introduction

1. By this action, Petitioner challenges the decision of the City of Los Angeles,
made by the City Council of the City of Los Angeles (the City), to approve the
development of, and to certify CEQA Environmental Impact Report for, the
Vesting Tentative Tract No. 67505 Project proposed to be constructed at 22241-

2. 22255 Mulholland Drive in the City of Los Angeles (the Project).

10 The Project, as proposed, is unsuitable for its site, on which 268 trees are

11 growing, including 199 coast live oaks and 10 Southern California black walnuts.

12 The site is sloped, and the proposed construction of 19 homes on the Project Site

13 will require huge amount of destructive grading. The Project would also

14 obstruct important wildlife corridors in the area.

3.
15 The Environmental Impact Report for the Project violates CEQA by failing to

16 adequately analyze and mitigate environmental impacts, including greenhouse-

17 gas emissions and impacts on biological resources.
t 4. The City abused its discretion in approving the Project and related
environmental documentation, as described below.

20
21 Parties

5.
22 Petitioner Advocates for the Environment (Advocates) is a Los Angeles,

23 California, nonprofit public-benefit corporation that litigates in the public

24

25 6. interest to protect the environment, with a strong focus on climate change.
Respondent City of Los Angeles (City), a charter city and municipal

26 corporation, is responsible for regulating and controlling land use in the City's

27
28 territory, including but not limited to implementing and complying with the
provisions of CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, other California laws, and its
General Plan. Respondent City is the lead agency for purposes of Public own

29

30 Resources Code section 21067, with principal responsibility for conducting

31
7. environmental review for and approving the Project.

32

33 Real Party in Interest DS Ventures, LLC is a California LLC with its principal

34 place of business in California at 6363 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 600, Los Angeles,
CA 90048.

35 8. Real Party in Interest Harridge San Feliciano, LLC, is a Delaware LLC with its

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

,

CONOUPWN- principal place of business in California at 6363 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 600, Los
Angeles, CA 90048.
9. On information and belief, DS Ventures, LLC and Harridge San Feliciano , LLC
(collectively, Applicant), are the applicants for the Project entitlements.
10. Petitioner is currently unaware of the true names and capacities of Real Parties
in Interest Does 1 through 10, and therefore sues those parties by such fictitious
names. Does 1 through 10 are agents of Applicant who are responsible in some
manner for the conduct described in this petition, or other persons or entities
10 who claim some legal or equitable interest in the subject matter of this action.

11 Petitioner will amend this petition to show the true names and capacities of
992092098 Does 1 through 10 when such names and capacities become known.

Jurisdiction and Venue
11. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this petition under Code
of Civil Procedure (CCP) S$ 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code
S$ 21167, 21168, and 21168.5.
12. This case is properly classified as an unlimited civil case, and therefore is within
the jurisdiction of this Court, because it is not one of the types of cases listed as
limited civil cases in CCP §$ 86, 86.1, or 87.
21 13. Venue is proper in this Court under CCP $ 394 because Respondent is local
22 agency situated within Los Angeles County, which is where the Project's
23 environmental effects will be felt.

24 14. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this action and have
2.5 exhausted all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.
26
27 General Allegations

28 The Project Site
29 15. The Project is proposed to be built on a 6.2-acre site located at 22241-22255
30 Mulholland Drive, Los Angeles (the Project Site).
31
32 16. The Project Site currently harbors 268 trees, including 199 coast live oaks and 10

33 Southern California black walnuts. Many of these trees will need to be removed

34 to develop the Project. The site is sloped, and the proposed construction of 19

35 homes on the Project Site will require a huge amount of destructive grading.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

H N Important wildlife corridors run through the Project Site.

G. D The Project
17. The Project would demolish an abandoned single-family dwelling and
5 associated structures on the Project Site.

6 18. The Project would subdivide the Project Site into 19 lots and construct 19 single-
7 family residences on those lots. A new private street would provide access to
8 twelve residences; access to the other homes would be provided from Mulholland
9 Drive and San Feliciano Drive.
10 19. Because of the Project Site's uneven slopes and the Project's density, the Project
11 would require a huge amount-tens of thousands of cubic yards--of grading, and
12 extensive retaining walls that would substantially alter the site's conformation.
13 20. The Project would require the removal of 32 trees, including 11 living trees 14 protected under the City's Protected Tree Ordinance. It would also encroach 15 within the driplines of 46 coast live oak trees, potentially harming them. 16
17 21. The Project would block important wildlife corridors running through the

18 Project Site.

19 Environmental Review and Project Approval
20 22. A Draft Environmental Impact Report for the Project (the DEIR) was prepared 21 and circulated in March, 2016. The City's case number for the EIR is ENV-2005- 22 2301-EIR, and its State Clearinghouse Number is 2005111054.
23 23. The Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) was prepared and circulated in 24 August, 2018. 25

26 24. On November 1, 2019, the City's Deputy Advisory Agency (DAA) and Zoning

27 Administrator (ZAD) certified the EIR and approved the entitlements for the

28 Project. The DAA certified the EIR, a Mitigation Monitoring Program (MMP)

29 and Tract Map No. 67505 (Tract Map, collectively DAA Entitlements). The

30 ZAD approved (1) a Zoning Administrator's Determination to allow Lot 13 to

31 include a retaining wall 70 feet in length and up to eight feet in height, in lieu of

32 the 3.5' height limit allowed by the zoning code; and (2) a Zoning

33 Administrator's Determination to alow five retaining walls on one lot with a

34 maximum height of 11'6" in lieu of the maximum one retaining wall per lot

35 permitted by LAMC $ 12.21 C.8 (ZAD Entitlements). This petition shall refer

3-

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

OONOUAWNH to the DAA Entitlements and ZAD Entitlements collectively as the Project
Entitlements.

25. Eight persons appealed the DAA and/or ZAD Determinations to the South
Valley Area Planning Commission (SVAPC), but the SVAPC failed to act
within the statutory deadline, so the appeals were deemed denied by operation
of law. The Los Angeles Department of City Planning (Department) issued a
letter of determination documenting the denial on May 19, 2020.
26. The DAA Approvals were appealed to the City Council, but on June 23, 2020,
10 the City Council, under authority of Charter Section 245, remanded the case

11 back to the SVAPC.

S0200998 27. The Department prepared Erratum No. 1, essentially an addendum to the EIR,
in September 2020. Erratum No. 1 evaluated changes in 1 the Project, including
changes to the retaining walls previously approved by the ZAD, and disclosed
vastly increased grading that would be necessary for the Project.
28. On September 24, 2020, the SVAPC held a public hearing on the ZAD appeals,
took no action, and continued the matter to a date uncertain.
29. The Department prepared Erratum No. 2 in October 2020. Erratum No. 2
evaluated changes in the Project made since the issuance of Erratum No. 1,

21 including changes to the retaining walls previously approved by the ZAD.
30. On December 8, 2020, the City Council's Planning and Land Use Management
22 (PLUM) Committee, after holding a public hearing, voted to recommend that
23
24 the City Council deny the appeals and approve the DAA Entitlements.
25 31. On December 9, 2020, the City Council adopted the recommendation of the
PLUM Committee, denying the appeals and approving the EIR and DAA
26 Entitlements.
27

28 32. The EIR certified by the City consists of the DEIR, FEIR, Erratum No. 1 and
Erratum No. 2.
29
30 33. On December 15, 2020, the City filed a Notice of Determination (NOD) for the

31 Project with the Los Angeles City Clerk.

RNOTDONDOI First Cause of Action
Violation of Planning and Zoning Law
34. Petitioner incorporates 95 1-33 above as though set forth here.

Failure to Approve ZAD Entitlements
35. On November 1, 2019, the Zoning Administrator approved the ZAD
Entitlements, allowing extensive retaining walls to be built on-site, beyond what
the LAMC would normally allow.
10 36. The ZAD Entitlements were appealed by several parties.

11 37. After the appeals, the ZAD Entitlements were substantially changed twice, as
described in Erratum No. 1 and Erratum No. 2.
MycasatEu 38. The modified ZAD Entitlements were never approved by any City agency or
body with authority to approve them, including the SVAPC, PLUM Committee
or City Council.
39. The Court should therefore order the ZAD Entitlements set aside.

Inconsistency with the General Plan
40. The Canoga Park-Winnetka-Woodland Hills-West Hills Community Plan
(Community Plan) is the portion of the City of Los Angeles General Plan
22 containing land-use specifics for the Project Site. The Planning and Zoning Law
23 prohibits the City from approving the Project unless it is consistent with

83 applicable general-plan and specific-plan policies and objectives.
41. The Project is inconsistent with the following Community Plah Objectives and
Policies, so the City abused its discretion in approving the Project:
26 a.
27 Policy 1-3.3: "Preserve existing views in hillside areas." The Project's walls
obstruct existing views from around the Project Site. 28
29 b. Objective 1-5: "To limit the intensity and density of residential

30 development in hillside areas." The Project is in a hillside area, and its

31 density and intensity require a huge amount of grading to fit the dense

32 project on the site.

33 C. Policy 1-5.3: "Consider the steepness of the topography and suitability of

34 the geology in any proposal for development within the Plan area.' The

35 Project Site is too steep for the Project.

. 5 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

ooaupwN d. Policy 1-5.4: "Require that any proposed development be designed to
enhance and be compatible with adjacent development." The Project is
incompatible with the surrounding development.

Inconsistency with the Specific Plan
42. The Planning and Zoning Law requires the City not to approve projects that are inconsistent with the specific plan applicable to the Project Site. The applicable
specific plan in this case is the Mulholland Scenic Parkway Specific Plan
(Specific Plan).
10
11 43. The Specific Plan requires that no permit for the use of land shall be issued until

S92295298588N the project has been reviewed by the Director of City Planning acting on a
recommendation of the Mulholland Scenic Parkway Design Review Board
(DRB).
44. The Tract Map is "permit for the use of land" under the Specific Plan. The
DRB has never reviewed the Project, so the City's approval of the Project violates
the Specific Plan.
45. Specific Plan $ 11.1.3.i specifies a factor that the board should use in considering
whether to approve the project: "whether the site layout is designed so as to
require a minimum of grading and retaining walls and protects prominent
ridges, streams, and environmentally sensitive areas." As a result of the huge
amount of grading and the extensive retaining walls in the Project, the DRB
would need to recommend disapproval of the Project; the Project is inconsistent
with this Specific Plan provision.
25 46. Specific Plan $ 5.B.3 requires that "no project shall be erected and no earth shall
26 be graded within 200 feet of the boundaries of any public parkland without the
27 prior written approval of the Director pursuant to Section 11 [i.e. after a DRB
28 hearing]." 'The Project is within 200 feet of Alizondo Drive Park, so this
29 provision applies to the Project, but the Director has not issued the required
30 approval. Section 5.B.3 lists five findings the Director must make in order to
31 approve a Project, and the Director has made none of those findings. Project
32 approval therefore violated the Specific Plan.
33 47. Under Specific Plan $ 5.B.4, "no oak tree ... shall be removed, cut down or
34 moved without the prior written approval of the Director." The section lists two
35

4.

findings the Director must make in order to give such an approval, and the
2 Director has made neither of the findings, nor issued an approval for the oak-
m v ON 00 0 tree removal for this Project. Project approval therefore violated the Specific
Plan.

Second Cause of Action
Violation of the Subdivision Map Act
48. Petitioner incorporates 9g 1-33 as though set forth here.
49. Gov. Code $$ 66473.5 and 66474(a) require that tract maps be consistent with 10 11 General Plans and Specific Plans. As alleged above, the Tract Map is inconsistent
with the General Plan and the Specific Plan, so the City has violated the
12 Subdivision Map Act (SMA) by approving it.
13
14 50. The City has made findings under Gov. Code $ 66474(c) and (d), finding that
15 is "the site is physically suitable for the proposed type of development," and the
SOMDCDSI is site is physically suitable for the proposed density of development," but the City
abused its discretion in making these findings, because they are not true, and are
not supported by substantial evidence in the record.
51. The City has made findings under Gov. Code $ 66474(e) finding that "the design
of the subdivision and the proposed improvement are not likely to cause
substantial environmental damage or substantially and avoidably injure fish or
wildlife or their habitat," but the City abused its discretion in making this
finding, because it is not true, and is not supported by substantial evidence in
the record.
52. Gov. Code $ 66473.1 requires that the City disapprove a tract-map application
26 unless it finds that the design of the project will provide, to the extent feasible, for

27 future passive or natural heating or cooling opportunities in the subdivision. The

28 City made finding on this issue in this case, but that finding is completely

29 conclusory, just another check-off box for the City in preparing the VTTM

30 findings. There is no evidence in the record showing the developer has made any

31 attempt to adjust the tract-map design to maximize passive and natural heating
or cooling opportunities in the Project. The City's finding that the tract map will 32
33 provide for future passive or natural heating or cooling to the extent feasible is

34 not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

Third Cause of Action
Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
)v 53. Petitioner incorporates 9g 1-33 as though set forth here.

Failure to Recirculate the EIR After Adding the Errata
6 54. The EIR was not effectively certified until the December 9, 2020 City Council
7 meeting. Until the City Council certified the EIR on that date, the EIR was the
8 subject of one or more unresolved administrative appeals.
9 55. When an EIR has not been certified, CEQA Guidelines $ 15088.5 requires the 10
11 EIR to be recirculated whenever significant new information is added to the EIR
after the public review period. The original DEIR public review period ended on 12
13 April 29, 2016.

14 56. Erratum No. 1 and Erratum No. 2, added to the EIR in 2020, constitute

15 "significant new information" that was added to the EIR after the public review
16 period. This new information shows, among other impacts, that grading on the

17 site will be much more extensive than the grading analyzed in the DEIR. The
18 increased grading will increase several types of impacts, including impacts on
19 water quality, hydrology, air quality and oak trees. Erratum No. 1 discloses, for 1
20 the first time, that approximately 26,800 cubic yards of soil would be
21 overexcavated and backfilled as a 15-foot compacted fill cap. And Erratum No. 2
22 states that the Project will require total net import of 7,400 cubic yards of

23 material instead of the 4,200 cubic yards analyzed in the EIR, and other evidence

24 in the record shows this may be a gross underestimate.

25 57. The Tract Map was modified shortly before the City Council hearing to eliminate
26 the prohibition of accessory dwelling units on the Project's lots. This is also
27 "significant new information" under CEQA.

28 58. The City violated CEQA by failing to recirculate the EIR after adding Erratum
29 No. 1 and Erratum No. 2 and modifying conditions of approval of the Tract Map.
30

31 Failure to Adequately Analyze the Project's GHG Impacts
32 59. The EIR's analysis of the Project's greenhouse-gas (GHG) impacts does not
33 comport with CEQA's requirements.
34
35

- 8 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

•

GONOUPWNI 60. The EIR analysis under Threshold 1, which determined that the Project does not
generate GHGs that, directly or indirectly, may have a significant impact on the
environment, compares the Project's projected GHG emissions under a "Business
as Usual" (BAU) regulatory environment with the Project's projected emissions
under the regulatory environment in place at the time the EIR was issued. It
determined that the laws and regulations of the State of California would reduce
the Project's GHG emissions by 32% from BAU and, since this reduction amount
exceeds the 15.3% reduction threshold in the CARB 2014 Scoping Plan, the EIR

10 determined that the Project's GHG emissions are not significant under CEQA.
61. This analysis violates CEQA case law, including Center for Biological Diversity v.
11 Dept. of Fish & Wildlife (2015) 62 Cal.4th 204 [Newhall]. Under this analysis no
12 13 project would have significant GHG emissions, because every project can benefit
from the State's regulations reducing GHG emissions.
14 1222% Failure to Adequately Analyze the Project's Impacts on Groundwater and Oak
Trees

62. The EIR violates CEQA by containing a misleading and incomplete analysis of
19 the Project's impacts on oak trees on and around the Project Site.

20 63. Evidence in the record shows that Project grading will require the placement of a
21 large amount of compacted fill over most of the Project Site, which will
22 significantly change the naturally occurring groundwater flow through the site.

23 The Project will also increase impervious surfaces from zero to seventy percent,
24 decreasing groundwater recharge that waters the oak trees on the site. Adding
25 extensive retaining walls, extending far below ground surface, will exacerbate this

26 impact. And grading of the site will significantly alter the flow of surface water on
the site.
27
28 64. The changes in groundwater and surface water flow resulting from the Project

29 grading, the decrease in impervious surfaces, and the retaining walls are likely to

30 harm the oak trees on the site. These impacts on oak trees were not adequately

31 analyzed in the EIR,

32

33 Failure to Adequately Analyze the Project's Impacts on Wildlife Corridors

34 65, There is substantial expert evidence in the record showing the Project sits at the

35 confluence of local wildlife corridors. There are populations of mountain lions,

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

oœvauewN: bobcats, grey fox and mule deer who traverse corridors near or on the Project
Site.
66. The EIR fails to adequately analyze the Project's impacts on wildlife movement
through and around the site because it deprecates the evidence showing the
existence of local wildlife corridors.

Failure to Adequately Analyze the Project's Impacts on Hydrology and Water
Quality
67. The extensive grading on the Project Site, and the increase in impervious surfaces

11 from zero to approximately seventy percent would result in potentially significant

35 water-quality impacts. Impervious surfaces collect oil and grease, pesticides and
garbage, among other pollutants, before allowing them to discharge during
storms into the storm drains. The discharge of this polluted water harms water

095 quality, and impact that was not properly analyzed in the EIR.

17 68. Extensive grading and paving of the site will substantially alter the existing

18 drainage pattern of the Project Site, resulting in potentially significant impacts.

19 The changes may affect the course of the blue-line stream running through the
Project Site. The hydrological effects of this alteration were not adequately

20 analyzed in the EIR. in

21
22 Failure to Discuss Project's Energy Impacts

23
24 69. CEQA Guidelines, Appendix F, requires an EIR to "include a discussion of the

25 potential energy impacts of proposed projects, with particular emphasis on

26 avoiding or reducing inefficient, wasteful and unnecessary consumption of energy." The EIR in this case includes no such discussion.

27
28 Failure to Analyze Impacts of Allowing Accessory Dwelling Units

29 70. Shortly before the EIR was certified by the City Council, the Tract Map

30

31 Conditions of Approval were modified to delete the requirement that "No second
dwelling units or accessory dwelling units shall be permitted on each lot."

32
33 71. As a result of the late change, it is reasonably foreseeable that many of the

34 eventual owners of the 19 Project residences will construct an accessory dwelling

35 unit (ADU) on their property. Constructing these ADUs will result in more

- 10 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

grading, more interference with groundwater hydrology, and a further reduction
2 in impervious surfaces, among other impacts.
3 72. The EIR violates CEQA by failing to analyze the indirect impacts of constructing
4 these ADUs.
5

6 Failure to Disclose and Analyze Impacts of Grading
N 0 O 73. Erratum No. 2 states that the Project will require total net import of 7,400 cubic
yards of material instead of the 4,200 cubic yards analyzed in the EIR, and other
evidence in the record shows this may be a gross underestimate.
10
11 74. Erratum No. 1 disclosed, for the first time, that construction of the Project would
require 26,800 additional cubic yards of grading, to move unsuitable soil and
m $40 g replace it as a 15-foot compacted fill cap.
75. The EIR fails to analyze the effects of these changes, which may have significant
environmental impacts on oak trees, hydrology, water quality, and air quality
16 (due to extra construction emissions).
17
18 Failure to Analyze Impacts of Inconsistencies with General and Specific Plans

19 76. CEQA requires an EIR to analyze any inconsistencies with applicable general and
20 specific plans.
21 77. The EIR's analysis of consistency with the Specific Plan and General Plan is
22 faulty. As alleged above, the Project is inconsistent with the Specific Plan and
23 General Plan, though the EIR found the Project to be consistent with those plans.
24 78. The EIR's inconsistency with those plans will result in physical impacts on the
25 environment, including impacts caused by the huge amount of grading and
26 modification of site topography, and removal of oak trees. These impacts should
27 have been analyzed in the EIR.
28

29 Improperly Deferred Mitigation Measures
30 79. CEQA allows mitigation measures to be formulated after the approval of the EIR
31 only when it is infeasible to formulate them prior to EIR approval and only when
32 they contain performance standards to ensure a particular level of mitigation.
33 80. There is no showing in the EIR that it would not be feasible to formulate all
34 mitigation measures, including Mitigation Measures D-7 and B-1, before
35

. 11 -

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

approving the EIR. It violates CEQA to defer formulation of a mitigation
2 measure that could feasibly be formulated before EIR approval.
3 81. CEQA requires ascertainable and enforceable performance standards when
4 deferring mitigation measures such as D-7 and B-1, but neither of these measures
5 contain such enforceable performance standards.
6

7 82. Mitigation measure D-7 requires a survey to determine if a rodent problem

8 exists, and unspecified remediation if it does. It violates CEQA by containing no

9 standards for determining when the rodent problem is solved following the

10 unspecified remediation.

11 83. Mitigation Measure B-1 requires a landscape plan to provide for maintenance of

12 the trees and other vegetation on the site. There is no reason the plan couldn't be

13 drafted now, and the plan contains no performance standards to ensure that it

14 will actually result in preservation of the trees and other vegetation. This violates

15 CEQA.

17 Improperly Constrained Alternatives

18 84. CEQA requires the EIR to contain an adequate discussion of project alternatives

19 SO that decision-makers will be provided with adequate information about the

20 range of options available to reduce or avoid environmental impacts.
21 85. Guidelines $ 15126.6(a) requires the EIR to describe a range of reasonable
22 alternatives that would feasibly attain most of the basic objectives of the project
23 but would avoid or substantially lessen any of the significant effects of the project.
24 The EIR here, which analyzes just the No Project alternative, and the Park
25 Alternative, does not comply with $ 15126.6(a) because those two alternatives do

26 not amount to a reasonable range of alternatives.
27 86. The Project Objective specifying 19 homes is an attempt to artificially narrow the
28 range of alternatives to be considered in the EIR. This is an artificially narrow
29 project objective that precludes consideration of reasonable alternatives.
30 87. The EIR violates CEQA by failing to consider a reasonable range of alternatives
31 to the Project, including a lower-density project with less grading that would
32 have far fewer environmental impacts.
