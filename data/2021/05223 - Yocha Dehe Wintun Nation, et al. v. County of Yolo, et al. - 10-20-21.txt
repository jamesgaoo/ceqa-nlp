VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1. By this action, the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation ("Yocha Dehe" or "the Tribe"), the Sierra

2 Club, the Yolo County Farm Bureau ("Farm Bureau"), and Voices for Responsible Leadership (*VRL")

3 (together, "Petitioners") hereby challenge actions by the County of Yolo, the Yolo County Board of

4 Supervisors, and the Yolo County ("Respondents" or "County") to approve the Yolo County Cannabis
5 Land Use Ordinance ("CLUO"), to approve and certify the CLUO Environmental Impact Report

6 ("EIR"), and to make findings in support of the CLUO's approval.
7 2. To be clear, Petitioners do not challenge or dispute that cannabis can be legally
8 cultivated, sold, and used in the State of California. Nor do they take issue with the ability of Yolo

9 County residents or the County itself - to profit from the cannabis industry. But Petitioners must
10 respectfully insist that County regulation of cannabis land uses - no less than its regulation of other land
11 uses - be sound, transparent, and consistent with state laws mandating careful environmental review and
d'TTTHMXDOM  HOSMIN NVWdVN 12
595 PACIFIC AVE., FLOOR 4 EETP6 VO 'OOSIONVAH NYS meaningful government-to-government tribal consultation.
13 3. Unfortunately, Respondents have not even approached compliance with these basic legal
14 requirements. The final version of the CLUO was not subject to public review, conflicts with the
15 California Land Conservation Act (the "Williamson Act"), arbitrarily and capriciously dismisses
16 common-sense options for sensible cannabis land use regulation, and it is not supported by legally
17 required findings. The EIR lacks a stable and finite project description, employs an improper
18
environmental baseline, fails to properly address, analyze and mitigate the CLUO's numerous
19

20 environmental impacts, and ignores reasonable alternatives, all in violation of the California

21 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). The County has compounded these errors by improperly

22 foreclosing potentially feasible alternatives and mitigation, by committing to implement the CLUO

23 before certifying the EIR, and by refusing to recirculate the EIR for public review and comment

24 following introduction of significant new information. And, throughout this flawed process, the County

25 failed to comply with its obligation to meaningfully consult with Yocha Dehe, a federally recognized

26 tribal government, as required by Senate Bill 18 ("SB 18").

27 4. Accordingly, this Court should find and determine that the County's approval of the

28 CLUO is invalid and void; that the CLUO EIR fails to satisfy CEQA and CEQA's implementing

2

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Guidelines; and that the County must fully comply with applicable law before taking any further steps to

2 implement the CLUO.

3

PARTIES 4

5 5. Petitioner YOCHA DEHE WINTUN NATION is a federally recognized, sovereign

6 Indian tribe (85 Fed. Reg. 5462, 5466 [Jan. 30, 2020]) whose ancestors have lived in what is now the

7 County of Yolo for thousands of years. Yocha Dehe's sovereign trust lands are located within the

8 County, and the Tribe also owns in fee simple lands within the County that are subject to fee-to-trust

9 applications. As the historical inhabitants of the Capay Valley, the Yocha Dehe possesses a uniquely

10 sacred connection to the land, which remains its most important link to the Tribe's traditional lifeways.

11 Indeed, the Tribe remains committed to protecting the land as its most sacred resource. Among other

d'TTTIMXDOM  HOSMIN NVTdVN 12 things, it showcases its commitment to land and environmental stewardship through its farming
595 PACIFIC AVE., FLOOR 4 EETP6 VO 'OOSIONVAH NYS 13 operations, cultivating a variety of crops across 2,000 acres. Sustainable farming practices such as drip

14 irrigation, biological controls, and crop rotation help maintain crop health while conserving water and

15 maintaining the quality of the soil. Yocha Dehe is equally committed to community development and

16 infrastructure in its greater Capay Valley homeland, and in recent years it has contributed millions of

17 dollars to community institutions that the County could not or would not properly fund, including

18 Esparto schools, the Esparto community pool and athletic center, the Madison Migrant Center, and

19 Esparto's Capay Valley Health and Community Center, among others. Yocha Dehe and its citizens are
20 adversely affected by the County's failure to comply with the law in approving the CLUO. Yocha Dehe
21 objected to approval of the CLUO and provided written and oral comments on the CLUO EIR
22 6. Petitioner SIERRA CLUB is a California nonprofit membership organization
23 incorporated under the laws of the State of California in 1892. Currently, the Sierra Club has
24 approximately 820,000 members, approximately 180,000 of whom live in California. Approximately
25 20,000 members belong to the Sierra Club's Motherlode Chapter, and Motherlode Chapter members
26 live, work, travel and enjoy recreational activities in Yolo County. The Sierra Club functions to educate 27 and enlist people to protect and restore the natural and human environment, to practice and promote 28

3

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

responsible use of the earth's ecosystems and resources, to explore, enjoy, and protect wild places, and

2 to use all lawful means to achieve these objectives. The Sierra Club has expressed particular concern for

3 the environment in which its members live, including Yolo County. Sierra Club and its members are

4 adversely affected by the County's failure to comply with the law in approving the CLUO. Sierra Club
5 and its members objected to approval of the CLUO and provided written and oral comments on the

6 CLUO EIR.

7 7. Petitioner YOLO COUNTY FARM BUREAU is a non-governmental, non-profit,

8 California voluntary membership corporation whose purpose is to protect and promote agricultural
9 interests in Yolo County and to find solutions to problems of the farm, the farm home, and the rural
10 community. The Farm Bureau counts more than 800 members within Yolo County, and it represents the
11 interests of its members, their families, and many more who are engaged in agricultural businesses and
d'TTTHMXDOM  HOSMIN NVWdVN 12
595 PACIFIC AVE., FLOOR 4 EETP6 VO 'OOSIONVAH NYS occupations in the County. The Farm Bureau and its members are adversely affected by the County's
13 failure to comply with the law when adopting the CLUO. The Farm Bureau and its members objected to
14 approval of the CLUO and provided written and oral comments on the CLUO EIR.
15 8. Petitioner VOICES FOR RESPONSIBLE LEADERSHIP is an unincorporated
16 community group whose members advocate for sound land use, environmental, and community
17 development policies in Yolo County. VRL's members reside in Yolo County, including in rural areas
18 of the County which would bear the brunt of the CLUO's environmental impacts. VRL and its membersl
19 are adversely affected by the County's failure to comply with the law when adopting the CLUO. VRL 20

21 and its members objected to approval of the CLUO and provided timely comments on the CLUO EIR.

9. 22 Respondent COUNTY OF YOLO is a political subdivision of the State of California.

23 The CLUO is memorialized in the County's ordinances and General Plan. The CLUO EIR and other

24 notices and public documents issued in connection with the EIR identify "County of Yolo" as the lead

25 agency responsible for preparing the EIR and determining the EIR's contents.

26 10. Respondent YOLO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS exercises both legislative

27 and executive functions of government, including responsibility for promulgation of County ordinances

28 and amendments to the County General Plan. The Board of Supervisors approved the CLUO.

DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

11.

2 Respondent YOLO COUNTY COMMUNITY SERVICES DEPARTMENT is a

3 department of the County of Yolo that is charged with supporting healthy, safe, and sustainable

4 communities. Certain public notices and documents, including portions of the CLUO EIR, identify

5 "Yolo County Community Services Department" as responsible for preparing the EIR and determining

the EIR's contents.

6 12.

7 Respondents, and each of them, have authority to respond to any order of this Court

8 regarding the CLUO, the CLUO EIR, or the County's obligations to consult with tribal governments.

13.

9 Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate,

10 associate or otherwise, of DOE 1 through DOE 1 50, inclusive, and therefore sues said parties under

11 fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition to show their true names and capacities when the

12 same have been ascertained. Each of these parties is a subdivision or agent of the County and performed

21

22 Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to filing this action and have

6 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

19.

7 This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Article VI, Section 10 of the California

8 Constitution; Code of Civil Procedure sections 410.10, 526, 526a, and 1060; and Code of Civil

9 Procedure section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code section 21168 or, in the alternative, Code of Civil

10 Procedure section 1085 and Public Resources Code section 21168.5.

20. Venue in this Court is
11 proper under California Code of Civil Procedure sections 392(a),

KAPLAN KIRSCH & ROCKWELL LLP 12 393(b), and 394(a) because the County of Yolo's actions impact Petitioners (and their members and

EETP6 VO 'OOSIONVAH NYS 595 PACIFIC AVE., FLOOR 4 13 citizens) within Yolo County and because the CLUO is being implemented within the County.

14 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

15 21.

16 In 2016, the County enacted an "interim" program allowing cultivation of cannabis for

17 medical purposes. The County declined to prepare a Negative Declaration or an EIR on the 2016

18 "interim" program on the ground that the program was intended to be temporary - a short-term initiative
while the County prepared a more comprehensive regulatory scheme.

19 22.

20 In 2017, the County expanded the "interim" program to authorize recreational cannabis

21 cultivation. This time, the County declined to prepare a Negative Declaration or an EIR on the ground

22 that the program was already in existence. But the County continued to assert that the "interim"

23 program was only temporary. Further, the County represented that approvals issued pursuant to the

24 "interim" program could be terminated at any time and for any reason, and that such approvals did not

25 confer any long-term rights or entitlements. From 2017, and at all relevant times thereafter, (a) the

26 County office from which cannabis approvals were issued contained a large sign warning that such

27 approvals were subject to termination and should not be relied upon; and (b) County documents required

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 in connection with application for and issuance of cannabis approvals included language confirming that

3 such approvals could be cancelled and did not provide long-term rights or entitlements.

23.

4 As expanded in 2017, the "interim" program did not include sufficient procedural or

5 substantive safeguards to protect against the environmental, human health, and public safety impacts of

6 cannabis land uses, particularly in rural areas such as the Capay Valley. Moreover, the County was

7 unable or unwilling to take enforcement actions necessary to prevent such impacts. Members of the

8 County Board of Supervisors have expressly acknowledged that the "interim" program, as expended in

9 2017, created substantial environmental and public safety problems.

24.

10 When Petitioners Yocha Dehe and the Farm Bureau informed the County of their

11 environmental, health, and public safety concerns about the "interim" program, each was told that the

12 County would address those concerns through the development of the CLUO. Petitioner Yocha Dehe

595 PACIFIC AVE., FLOOR 4 KAPLAN KIRSCH & ROCKWELL LLP EETP6 VO 'OOSIONVAA NVS 13 was specifically assured that all options for addressing cannabis land use impacts - including reducing

14 or altogether eliminating cultivation licenses - remained on the table.

25.
15 In August of 2018, the County issued a Notice of Preparation ("NOP") notifying the

16 public of the CLUO and stating an intent to prepare the CLUO EIR. Among other things, the NOP

17 described five alternatives that would be addressed in the CLUO EIR. Contrary to the County's prior

18 representations to Petitioners Yocha Dehe and the Farm Bureau, none of the five alternatives identified

19 In the NOP reduced or eliminated cannabis cultivation licenses.

20 26. In September of 2019, staff for Petitioner Yocha Dehe met with County staff to discuss

21 the scope of the forthcoming CLUO Draft EIR. At the meeting, Yocha Dehe staff asked whether the

22 County planned to include in the Draft EIR any alternatives that would meaningfully reduce cannabis

23 cultivation. The County's contract planner stated that the Draft EIR would not contain such an

24

25 alternative. Yocha Dehe staff then explained that cannabis authorizations under the County's "interim"

26 program are temporary, (b) licensees have attested to their understanding of that fact, (c) the County had

27 authority to eliminate cannabis cultivation licenses for any reason or no reason at all, and therefore (d)

28 the scope of potentially reasonable alternatives should include alternatives that would reduce cannabis
land uses. The County's contract planner agreed, but nonetheless maintained that no cannabis reduction

7

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

alternative would be included in the EIR. She then elaborated that such an alternative could be added to

2 the EIR later, as a political decision by the Yolo County Board of Supervisors, and, further, that any

3 Board decision bearing on the County's CEQA analysis could be addressed by recirculating the EIR.

4 27. In October of 2019, the County released for public review and comment the CLUO Draft

5 EIR. The Draft EIR addressed five alternatives in detail, none of which involved any reduction of

6 cannabis land uses. The Draft EIR asserted that the final CLUO might combine elements of more than
7 one alternative, but the document did not specifically identify or evaluate the environmental impacts of

8 any such alternative. The Draft EIR admitted that overconcentration of cannabis land uses significantly
9 impacts the environment, but the document did not identify a specific overconcentration definition or
10 threshold; instead, the Draft EIR characterized overconcentration as a political determination. The Draft
11 EIR assumed an environmental baseline of 78 cannabis cultivation sites; at the time of the document's
12
595 PACIFIC AVE., FLOOR 4 d'TTTHMXDOM  HOSMIN NVWdVN EETP6 VO 'OOSIONVAA NVS release, there were not 78 active cannabis cultivation operations in Yolo County. The Draft EIR stated
13 that consultations with Petitioner Yocha Dehe were "ongoing"; at the time there were no ongoing
14 government-to-government consultations between the County and the Tribe.
15 28. In September of 2020, the County released the CLUO Final EIR. The County did not
16 certify the EIR at that time. Like the Draft EIR, the Final EIR addressed five alternatives in detail, none
17 of which involved any reduction of cannabis land uses. Like the Draft EIR, the Final EIR asserted that
18
the CLUO might combine elements of more than one alternative but did not specifically identify or
19 evaluate the environmental impacts of any such alternative. Like the Draft EIR, the Final EIR admitted 20

21 that overconcentration of cannabis land uses significantly impacts the environment but did not identify a

22 specific overconcentration definition or threshold. Like the Draft EIR, the Final EIR assumed an

23 environmental baseline of 78 cannabis cultivation sites; at the time of the Final EIR's release, there were

24 not 78 active cannabis cultivation operations in Yolo County.

25 29. In September, November, and December of 2020, the Yolo County Planning

26 Commission held "workshops" and other proceedings on the CLUO. During one such proceeding, a

27 Commissioner asked whether the County had addressed Yocha Dehe's concerns regarding the CLUO;

28 the County's contract planner responded, falsely, that all of Yocha Dehe's concerns had been addressed.

8

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 Yolo County's Citizen Advisory Committees ("CACs") were another topic addressed during the

3 Planning Commission proceedings; on that topic, County staff misleadingly represented to the Planning

4 Commission that Yolo County CACs generally favored the CLUO.

30.

5 Concerned about County staff's misrepresentation of CAC positions and other

6 community concerns, on February 26, 2021 Yocha Dehe organized and hosted public forum at which

7 residents, law enforcement, farmers, and policymakers could speak frankly and directly to each other

8 about cannabis land use issues. One Yolo County Supervisor, two Supervisorial deputies, the Yolo

9 County Sheriff, and numerous members of the community attended the form. Among other things,

10 attendees noted that community members are often intimidated by cannabis growers - many of whom

11 are armed and extremely aggressive - and therefore unwilling to report problems for fear of retribution.

KAPLAN KIRSCH & ROCKWELL LLP 12 This fear was compounded by concerns that the County's cannabis "task force" is captive to the

595 PACIFIC AVE., FLOOR 4 EETP6 VO 'OOSIONVAA NVS 13 industry; residents reported being "ratted out" by County employees after lodging complaints, and some

14 members of the task force refer to the cannabis cultivators they are supposed to regulate as "clients." As

15 a result, cannabis land use conflicts are significantly under-reported.

31.
16 In February of 2021, the Yolo County Supervisor elected to represent District 5 proposed

17 to Petitioner Yocha Dehe an alternative designed to address significant environmental and public safety

impacts
18 of cannabis cultivation. In brief, the Supervisor's alternative called for (a) a complete and

19 permanent ban on cannabis cultivation in the Capay Valley coupled with (b) a Tribe-funded buyout (or

20 "soft landing") for cannabis cultivators forced to relocate as a result. At the Supervisor's suggestion, the

21 Tribe formally proposed the "soft landing" alternative to the County. The County neither added the

22 alternative to the EIR nor determined it infeasible.

23 32. On May 13, 2021, the County's map of active cannabis cultivation sites identified 39

24 such sites, countywide.

25 33. In a series of proceedings conducted through the summer of 2021, the Yolo County

26 Board of Supervisors voted on the scope and contents of the final CLUO, including the range of

27

28 cannabis land uses that would be allowed, the locations where cannabis would be allowed, the number

9

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 of cannabis permits that would be allowed, and the buffers between land uses, among other things.
These votes were held prior to the certification of the EIR.

3 34.

4 On July 27, 2021, during one of the aforementioned Board of Supervisors proceedings,

5 County staff improperly invited reconsideration of the overconcentration threshold established by the

6 Board as a result of an earlier vote. County staff made the invitation on the ground that modification

7 was needed to avoid forcing cannabis cultivators to relocate. No environmental analysis was conducted
on either overconcentration threshold.

8 35.

9 On September 14, 2021, the Board of Supervisors approved the final CLUO, certified

10 the CLUO EIR, and adopted a statement of overriding considerations and other findings. The materials

11 presented to the Board on September 14 described the votes taken during the summer of 2021 as

12 "decisions regarding the scope and magnitude of cannabis activities" that would be "in the final CLUO."

595 PACIFIC AVE., FLOOR 4 KAPLAN KIRSCH & ROCKWELL LLP EETP6 VO 'OOSIONVAH NYS 13 The Staff Report for the Board's September 14 meeting states that County staff had "already started

14 working on the regulatory transition process including specific administrative procedures" to implement

the final CLUO.
15

16 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

17 (Violation of SB 18, Gov. Code § 65352.3, et seq.)

18
36. Brought by Yocha Dehe Against All Respondents

19 Paragraphs 1 through 35, inclusive, are realleged and incorporated by reference as if

20 specifically set forth herein.

21 37. SB 18 requires cities and counties to meaningfully consult with Native American tribes

22 impacted by amendments to the city or county's general plan on a government-to-government basis. See

23 Gov. Code 65352.3.

24 38. The CLUO was inconsistent with the County's general plan and required a general plan

25 amendment. In approving the CLUO, the County purported to amend its general plan.

26 39.

27 The Tribe reminded the County of the County's SB 18 obligations on multiple occasions,
including in its December 11, 2019, comments on the Draft EIR.

28

10

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

40. Nevertheless, the County failed to meaningfully consult with the Tribe, pursuant to SB

2 18, before approving the CLUO: the County failed to properly initiate SB 18 consultation with Yocha

3 Dehe; failed to consult with Yocha Dehe, on a government-to-government basis, as the CLUO evolved;

4 and failed to meaningfully consult with respect to feasible means of addressing Yocha Dehe's concerns.

5 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
6 (Violation of CEQA, Pub. Res. Code § 21000, et seq.)
7 Brought by All Petitioners Against All Respondents

8 41. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 40, inclusive, as

9 if specifically set forth herein.
10 42. CEQA mandates that an EIR contain an accurate, stable, and finite project description.
11 An EIR is inadequate when it sends unclear or conflicting signals to the public or to decision-makers
d'TTTHMXDOM  HOSMIN NVWdVN 12
595 PACIFIC AVE., FLOOR 4 about the nature of the project, or when it fails to clearly articulate the lead agency's proposed course of EETP6 VO 'OOSIONVAA NVS 13 action. Rather than identifying a specific project proposal, the CLUO EIR vaguely and impermissibly
14 referred to a range of conceptual scenarios. Further, the EIR indicated that the final CLUO could mix
15 elements from various alternatives - albeit without explaining just what might be included in that mix.
16 As a result, the County presented the interested public with a moving target that lacked clarity on critical
17 components of the CLUO. Indeed, the version of the CLUO ultimately adopted by the County was not
18 among the alternatives presented in the EIR. Due to the County's failure to provide an accurate, stable,
19 and finite project description, interested parties - including, but not limited to, Petitioners and their 20
members and citizens were left unclear about what, exactly, was proposed and how it might impact the 21
environment.
22
43. An EIR that uses an inaccurate baseline is deficient as an informational document and 23

24 inadequate as a matter of law. The CLUO EIR assumed an environmental baseline of 78 cannabis

25 cultivation sites, based on the total number of licenses contemplated under its interim program. The

26 County has never had 78 active, licensed cannabis cultivation sites at any one time. Furthermore,

27 licenses issued through the interim program were temporary, conveyed no long-term rights, and were

28 never subject to environmental review in a Negative Declaration or EIR. Moreover, eligibility for a

11

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

license is not the same as actual cultivation. Therefore, the CLUO EIR used an inaccurate baseline that

2 underestimates environmental impacts.

3 44. CEQA requires that an EIR thoroughly and properly analyze the direct, indirect, and

4 cumulative impacts of a proposed project. Here, the EIR's analysis of the CLUO's environmental

5 impacts is woefully inadequate. Among other things, the EIR fails to properly address, analyze, and

6 mitigate each of the following:
7

8 a. The County intends to increase cannabis activity over time, including through amendment of

9 the CLUO. This anticipated future expansion is not addressed in the EIR, as CEQA
requires. 10
b. The CLUO doubles the amount of cannabis canopy permitted at cultivation sites. This 11 change was made after the close of the EIR process and is nowhere evaluated in the EIR.
d'TTTHAMXDO  HOSMIX NVTdVX 12
595 PACIFIC AVE., FLOOR 4 EETP6 VO 'OOSIONVAA NVS C. The County's environmental analysis and findings assume the CLUO will eliminate illegal
13 cannabis cultivation. But the evidence shows the opposite: illegal grows use "permitted"
14 operations to hide in plain sight. The EIR does not properly account for the significant
15 impacts of illegal cultivation.
16 d. The EIR admits that overconcentration of cannabis cultivation is a significant environmental
17 problem, but it fails to identify a specific threshold of significance. There is no
18 environmental information or analysis supporting the over-concentration "threshold" in the
19 final CLUO, and the County has admitted the "threshold" was a political determination.
20
e. The EIR fails to address the likely relocation of cannabis land uses to the communities of
21 Esparto and Madison.
22 f. The EIR does not properly address the significant incompatibility between cannabis
23 cultivation and the traditional agricultural crops which, for more than a century, have formed
24 the backbone of Yolo County's economy (including both conventional and organic
25 agriculture). This incompatibility creates the potential for a significant loss of traditional
26 agricultural land uses, including those subject to Williamson Act contracts, contrary to state
27 law and County policy and planning documents.
28

12

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

g. The EIR fails to address the significant fire risk associated with cannabis land uses - a major

2 oversight given recent examples of cannabis-caused fires in rural areas of the County, the

3 limited firefighting resources of those same areas, and the changing fire risks associated with

4 climate change.

5 h. The EIR does not properly account for the CLUO's potentially significant impacts on water

6 supply. Although the EIR suggests, in a general way, that cannabis does not use as much

7 water as some other crops, there is no evidence that new cannabis cultivation in Yolo County

8 will replace more water-intensive land uses and generalized comparisons of average water

9 use do not account for localized cultivation clusters which are likely to occur in groundwater-

10 dependent communities like Esparto.

11 i. The EIR underestimates cannabis odor impacts on sensitive receptors by employing

12 inaccurate and unsupported assumptions that fail to properly account for odor levels,

595 PACIFIC AVE., FLOOR 4 d'TTTHMXDOM  HOSMIN NVWdVN EETP6 VO 'OOSIONVAA NVS minimum wind speeds, local terrain, time lag between reporting and inspection, and the 13
sensitivity of human receptors, among other things. 14
j. The EIR does not properly address greenhouse gas emissions and climate change, including 15 (among other things) the CLUO's incompatibility with the carbon neutrality target set forth
16
in County Resolution 20-114.
17 k. The EIR fails to address the CLUO's significant law enforcement impacts, particularly in 18 rural areas of the County.
19
1. The EIR does not address the CLUO's fundamental inconsistency with the Esparto 20
Community Plan. The Plan emphasizes agricultural development based on food crops, food
21 culture and food-based agricultural tourism, and expressly acknowledges Esparto's status as 22

23

24

25

26

27

28

13

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

the "Gateway to the Capay Valley." The EIR fails to confront these core elements of the

2 Plan, and it arbitrarily and capriciously treats Esparto as distinct from the Capay Valley.1

3 m. The EIR recognizes that cannabis land uses may have significant aesthetic impacts,

4 particularly in rural areas like the Capay Valley. The document proposes that this issue could

5 be addressed with screening. But the EIR does not address the impact of extensive screening

6 on the open, agricultural vistas that currently characterize the Capay Valley's scenic

7 environment.

8 n. The EIR fails to properly address the cumulative impact of the CLUO together with other

9 reasonably foreseeable past, present, and reasonably foreseeable future actions.

10 45. CEQA requires agencies to consider and impose feasible alternatives and mitigation

11 measures to avoid or reduce significant environmental impacts. Where commenters have proposed

12 alternatives or mitigation measures, the burden is on the lead agency to explain why those measures and
595 PACIFIC AVE., FLOOR 4 d'TTTHMXDOM  HOSMIN NVWdVN EETP6 VO 'OOSIONVAA NVS 13 alternatives are not potentially feasible. Petitioners identified multiple alternatives and mitigation

14 measures that could help avoid or reduce significant environmental impacts, but Respondents neither

15 determined them infeasible nor included them in the EIR or the CLUO. Furthermore, Respondents

16 improperly analyzed other alternatives, including indoor cultivation alternatives, that were referenced in

17 the EIR; indeed, the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors expressed concern that indoor cultivation

18 options had received little focus. Moreover, purported "mitigation" measures that were adopted by the

19 County are illusory and deficient as a matter of law.

20 46. A project for which an EIR is prepared cannot be approved until the EIR is properly

21 certified. Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 21151(a). In this context, "approval" includes any action "which gives

22 impetus to a planned or foreseeable project in a manner that forecloses alternatives or mitigation."
23 CEQA Guidelines § 15004(b)(2)(B). Ignoring that bedrock requirement, the County impermissibly
24

25 In negotiating Intergovernmental Agreements with Yocha Dehe, the County has always defined the

26 Capay Valley to include all land west of I-505, and pursuant to those Agreements the Tribe funds a

27 variety of Capay Valley services in and around Esparto and Madison. The EIR's failure to address
impacts in this area is particularly troubling given the County's own refusal to invest in appropriate
28 community development and infrastructure.

14

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2 foreclosed available mitigation and alternatives through a series of votes held by the Board of

3 Supervisors several months prior to certification of the EIR. By the County's own admission, these

4 votes were "decisions regarding the scope and magnitude of cannabis activities," including the range of

5 cannabis land uses allowed, the locations where cannabis would be allowed, the number of cannabis

6 permits that would be available, buffers between land uses, and over-concentration thresholds. These

7 decisions were made without a certified EIR and without reference to any CEQA analysis. Indeed, the

8 Staff Report for the Board's September 14, 2021, meeting (at which certification was to be

9 "considered") stated that "Staff has already started working on" implementation of the CLUO. Thus,

10 the County prematurely and improperly committed itself to the CLUO.

47.
11 Introduction of significant new information requires revision and recirculation of an EIR.

12 The final version of the CLUO was never evaluated in the Draft EIR or Final EIR, and it contains

595 PACIFIC AVE., FLOOR 4 KAPLAN KIRSCH & ROCKWELL LLP EETP6 VO 'OOSIONVAH NYS 13 extensive and significant new information - including, among other things, doubling the permissible

acreage
14 of each cultivation site and a new significance threshold for overconcentration not previously

15 evaluated or provided to the public. Furthermore, new and considerably different alternatives and

16 mitigation measures were made available to the County, as was new information regarding community

17 impacts. By failing to address significant new information in a recirculated EIR, the County deprived

18 the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment on substantial adverse environmental effects, as well

19 as feasible mitigation and alternatives that could help address those effects, all in violation of CEQA.

20 48. The County failed to make accurate findings, supported by substantial evidence, that the

21 EIR was completed in compliance with CEQA and that overriding considerations made infeasible

22 mitigation measures or alternatives that would lessen significant environmental effects identified in the

23 EIR as required by CEQA Guidelines sections 15090 and 15091.

24 49. The EIR, the County's certification of the EIR, and the findings in support thereof are

25

26 legally defective and the County committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a
manner required by law.

Re: Notice of Commencement of Action Under the California Environmental Quality Act

Dear Sir or Madam:

Please take notice, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21167.5, that the Yocha Dehe
Wintun Nation, the Sierra Club, the Yolo County Farm Bureau, and Voices for Responsible Leadership intend to commence an action against the County of Yolo, the Yolo County Board of Supervisors, and the Yolo County Community Services Department, for writ of mandate to set aside the decisions to approve the County's cannabis land use ordinance ("CLUO"), certify the final environmental impact report ("EIR") for the CLUO, and take related actions.
The action is based on the failure of the County and the County's Board of Supervisors to comply with California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") and Senate Bill 18. It will allege that the County failed to follow the required procedures and requirements, including by preparing a legally deficient EIR and by failing to meaningfully consult, on a government-to-government basis, with
the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation.

Among other things, the action will seek to invalidate and set aside the CLUO and the CLUO EIR;
to stay and enjoin any action to further implementation of the CLUO; and to secure a declaration that the CLUO and its approvals are of no force or effect.

If you need more information or have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Sincerely,

VeBre ALS
