INTRODUCTION
J A
2 1. This action challenges the December 17, 2020 decision of the County of
f
3 Tuolumne and its Board of Supervisors (collectively, "Respondents") to approve the
•
Yosemite Under Canvas project ("Project") and to certify the associated Environmental 170O0 41000
Impact Report ("EIR"). The County's approval of the Project will allow the construction of
99-unit camping facility to the west of a prime gateway into Yosemite National Park. 04 R DAI 7 The Project, which is located in a Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone, includes 99
canvas tents (each equipped with a propane stove) for a lodging operation intended to draw
9 hundreds of daily visitors to an undeveloped natural site surrounded by National Forest
10 land. The EIR fails to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's myriad environmental
11 effects, including impacts on public safety due to significant wildfire risk, evacuation and
12 emergency response, water quality and water supply, potential impacts to neighbors' wells,

i 13 noise, traffic, and roadway hazards. The impacts of the Project will be made all the worse
14 by the Terra Vi Lodge, a 126-room resort hotel with additional associated facilities, that 1::
15 will be located immediately across Highway 120 from the Project and was approved by
16 Tuolumne County ón December 31, 2020G 8

17 2. This petition challenges the Board of Supervisors' reliance on the EIR
18 prepared for the Project because the County failed to ensure that the EIR disclosed,
19 analyzed, and mitigated the Project's many foresecable impacts as required by the N1O4 4774809828 20 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code section 2100 et. 0TO
21 seq. and the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of Regulations, section 15000 et.
F

: 22 seq. The Project is also inconsistent with the County's General Plan and Zoning
23 Ordinance, designed to limit the impacts of commercial development and protect
1L0S 24 significant natural areas such as the Project site and its environs. For all these reasons and
25 as further detailed in this petition, the County's approval of the Project and certification of
26 the EIR violate CEQA and the Planning and Zoning Law and must be overturned;
27 PARTIES

to set aside their certification of the EIR and approvals for the Project. In the absence of

2 such remedies, Respondents' approvals will remain in effect in violation of state law, and
3 the environment and Petitioners will be irreparably harmed. No money damages or legal
4 remedy could adequately compensate for that harm.
STATEMENT OF FACTS

18. The proposed Project entails construction of a large, permanent luxury
campground facility, including 99 platform tents of 200 to 400 square feet in area per tent,
for a lodging operation that would host over 200 guests daily. Seventy-seven of the tents

9 would have private ensuite bathrooms, and the Project would also include two communal
10 bathroom facilities, a large reception and dining tent, a commercial kitchen, a laundry
11 facility, and housekeeping and maintenance structures. The Project would require
12 construction of two separate wastewater treatment systems, including septic systems and
13 two leach fields, as well as utilities, buried water pipes, driveways, culverts and bridges
14 crossing several drainages on the site, paths, and parking for 130 cars. The project would
15 also require the development of onsite wells sufficient to meet all project water demands
16 since no public water is accessible at this location. All of this infrastructure would be
17 constructed on an environmentally sensitive, currently undeveloped natural site adjacent to
18 National Forest land.

19 19. Some areas of the Project site were severely burned in the 2013 Rim Fire.
20 After that fire in December 2015, Gregory Robert Manley, the agent for Hardin Flat LLC,
21 entered into a grant agreement with CalFire, the state agency responsible for forestry
22 management, that resulted in the property owner receiving grant funding in the amount of
23 $34,000 to manage the property for forestry production and carbon sequestration. In
24 exchange, Manley agreed to keep the property in its status as commercial timberland and
25 not to develop the property for at least 10 years. Although this grant agreement would not
26 expire until 2025, the property owner abandoned any commitment to the agreement when
27 it proposed the Under Canvas project in 2018.
28 20. Notwithstanding the Project's significant environmental impacts, the County
6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

first proposed to approve it on the basis of a mitigated negative declaration--an
2 abbreviated environmental document that may only be employed where a project could not
3 have any significant environmental impacts. Tuolumne County elected to prepare an
4 environmental impact report only after members of Save Sawmill Mountain and CSERC
5 objected to the adequacy of the mitigated negative declaration and the Project's significant
6 impacts.

7 21. The County issued the Notice of Preparation for the EIR on June 18, 2019. In
8  its comments on the NOP, Save Sawmill Mountain expressed concern that the County's

9 list of potentially significant project impacts did not address many impact areas and
10 requested that the County conduct a full review of the Project and alternatives.
11 22. The County released the Notice of Availability for the draft EIR for the
12 Project on June 17, 2020 and provided just over 30 days-until July 20-for the
13 submission of public comments. Although the Notice of Availability purported to show a
14 review period running from June 5, 2020 to July 20th, the draft EIR was not actually
15 released until June 17th.

16 23. On the same day it released the Project draft EIR, the County also released
17 the draft EIR for the Terra Vi project (a resort lodge designed to accommodate over 500
18 guests) which is located immediately across Highway 120 from the Project. Because the
19 time for public comment on the Project EIR overlapped with the review period for the
20 Terra Vi project, many members of the public requested an extension of time so that they
21 would have sufficient time to understand the impacts of both projects and to inform the
22 County of their concerns. Combined, the two EIRs totaled thousands pages of detailed
23 written materials for citizen review. The County denied the many requests for additional
24 time for public review and also denied a request to extend the comment period for the
25 directly adjacent Terra Vi project's EIR.
26 24. Notwithstanding the constraints imposed by the County's overlapping review
27 periods, Petitioners and others diligently participated in the County's administrative
28 process for the Project. Concerned citizens, CSERC and the Tuolumne River Trust,
7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

another well-established, local environmental organization, submitted extensive comments

2 on the draft EIR. In addition to their comments on the NOP, Save Sawmill Mountain
3 submitted a lengthy letter detailing the final EIR's many deficiencies.

4 25. Comments submitted on the draft EIR raised concerns over the failure to
adequately evaluate the Project's significant impacts, in particular, impacts to the
6 surrounding community, guests, and staff from severe wildfire risks as well as impacts
7 related to traffic safety, water quality and water supply, potential impacts to neighbors'
8 wells, and the additional strain the project would pose for already over-stretched and
9 inadequate public services. Commenters criticized the draft EIR's inconsistent project

10 description and its failure to evaluate a reasonable range of project alternatives.
11 Commenters also noted the Project's many inconsistencies with the County General Plan's
12 land use designation of commercial recreation, which prohibits commercial development
13 that is not connected to public water and sewer services.

14 26. The County issued the final EIR on November 4, 2020 and set the Planning
15 Commission hearing for the Project just 2 weeks later, on November 18, 2020. During that
16 time, members of the public hurriedly submitted comments on the final EIR. In particular,
17 CSERC and the Tuolumne River Trust noted that the County not only had failed to
18 respond at all to their comments on the draft EIR, but that in fact, neither organization's
19 comments were contained within the final EIR. The County did not provide responses to
20| these organizations' detailed comments until 9:40 p.m. on November 17, the night before
21 the Planning Commission hearing.

22 27. At its November 18 hearing on the Project, the Planning Commission heard
23 testimony from residents throughout the County in opposition to the Project. An over-

24 whelming majority of commenters expressed concerns about the wildfire impacts of the
25 Project that would affect public safety, its impacts on water supply and quality, potential
26 impacts of the project to neighbors' wells, its traffic safety impacts, the inadequacy of
27 public services, and the need to consider a better range of project alternatives. Members of
28 Save Sawmill Mountain and other members of the public also objected that the Project was
8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

inconsistent with the County's General Plan and Zoning Ordinance. At that meeting, after

2 public testimony, Planning Commissioners collectively discussed concerns about the
3 wildfire impacts and safety of the Project, in particular the concern that the County had not
4 included adequate mitigation for these impacts. Despite discussing these concerns, the
Planning Commission nevertheless approved the Project with only minor modifications to

6 the conditions of approval for the Project.

7 28. On November 25, 2020, Save Sawmill Mountain appealed the Planning

8 Commission's decision to the Board of Supervisors. The County scheduled the Board of

9 Supervisors' hearing on the appeal for December 17, 2020.

10 29. Prior to the Board of Supervisor's hearing on the Project, on December 16,
11 2020, Save Sawmill Mountain submitted a letter elaborating on previous comments on
12 legal inadequacies in the EIR and detailing the final EIR's failure to adequately address
13 these issues.

14 30. At the Board hearing, many members of the public from throughout
15 Tuolumne County objected to the approval of the Project and continued to press their
16 concerns that the EIR had not adequately evaluated or mitigated project impacts and that
17 the Project was inconsistent with the County's General Plan and Zoning Ordinance.
18 Similar to concerns raised by members of the Planning Commission, members of the
19 Board of Supervisors expressed concern about whether the EIR had adequately addressed
20 wildfire threats to public safety, the extensive time delay before any fire suppression crew
21 could reach the remote site, and associated concerns. However, instead of requiring a new
22 analysis and mitigation, the Board simply modified the Project's conditions of approval to
23 require the use of propane, rather than wood-burning stoves in the Project's canvas tents.

24 31. The County filed a Notice of Determination the next day on December 18,
25 2020.

26 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

27 Violation of CEQA (Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq.)
28 32. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs in
0
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

their entirety.

2 33. CEQA is designed to ensure that government agencies incorporate the goal
3 of long-term protection of the environment into their decisions that may affect the

4 environment. CEQA applies to any discretionary action taken by an agency that may cause
5 a reasonably foreseeable change in the environment.

6 34. In furtherance of its goal of environmental protection, CEQA requires that an

7 agency prepare an EIR for a project whenever substantial evidence in the record supports a
8 fair argument that the project may have a significant impact on the environment. As the
9 cornerstone of the CEQA process, the EIR must disclose and analyze a project's
10 potentially significant environmental impacts. In addition, the EIR also must inform
11 decision-makers and the public of feasible mitigation measures and alternative project

12 designs or elements that would lessen or avoid the project's significant adverse
13 environmental impacts.

14 35. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency adopt all feasible mitigation
15 measures that would reduce or avoid any of the project's significant environmental
16 impacts. If any of the project's significant impacts cannot be mitigated to a less-than-
17 significant level, the project can be approved only if the agency finds that the project's
18 benefits would outweigh its unavoidable impacts.
19 36. Under CEQA, all findings required for any agency's approval of a project
20 must be legally adequate and supported by substantial evidence in the administrative
21 record, and CEQA further requires that an agency provide an explanation of how the
22 evidence in the record supports the conclusions that the agency has reached.
23 37. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying an EIR for the Project that is
24 inadequate and fails to comply with the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines.
25 The EIR's deficiencies include, but are not limited to, the following:

26 a. The EIR relies on an inconsistent and inadequate project description
27 that, among other legal deficiencies, omits key elements of the Project, inconsistently
28 describes the Project's development footprint and the amount of vegetation to be removed
10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

as a result of the Project, improperly defines the Project as a temporary use, fails to
2 acknowledge the cancellation of the CalFire grant agreement and the associated conversion

3 of the site from commercial timberland use, and fails to properly describe the number of
4 employees necessary to support the Project. As a result of this inadequate and inconsistent
5 project description the EIR fails to properly identify significant project impacts, mitigation
6 measures, and alternatives. For example, the EIR's project description substantially

7 underestimates the number of employees needed for the Project and therefore
8 underestimates housing impacts, water quality and water supply impacts, traffic impacts,

9 and wildfire safety impact, among others.
10 b. The EIR fails to adequately analyze the Project's significant wildfire
11 and fire safety impacts. Among other legal flaws, the EIR improperly includes mitigation
12 measures and conditions of Project approval as part of its project description in order to
13 find that the Project will have no significant impacts on wildfire and fire safety, even
14 though the Project will bring hundreds of people to an area designated as a severe high fire
15 hazard zone and will increase the risk of fire ignition through fire pits, stoves, smoking by
16 guests, and potential ignitions due to sparking from vehicles and equipment. As a result,
17 the EIR fails in its role as an informational document, and it fails to identify all feasible
18 mitigation measures necessary to address the Project's wildfire and safety impacts. Among
19 mitigation measures that were improperly rejected were sprinklers, fire hydrants, and
20 automatic alarms that could have reduced the Project's internal fire risk impacts, as well as
21 actions that would reduce risk of high severity wildfire sweeping onto the project site (as
22 in the 2013 Rim Fire) that would pose fire threat from external sources.

23 C. The EIR fails to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impacts
24 on emergency access, evacuation, and emergency response. Although evacuation during
25 wildfire events has become a significant factor in the ability to save lives, the EIR provides
26 only a cursory evaluation of this issue. For example, the EIR assumes no impact to
27 | emergency evacuation would occur in part because the Project has access to Highway
28 120 via Forest Service Route 1S09. However, the County has no jurisdiction over roads in
11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

the Forest Service system and federal regulations preclude the use of such roads for

2 commercial development. Even if Route 1S09 were available as a secondary evacuation
route, the EIR still fails to determine whether an adequate evacuation opportunity exists,
including basic questions such as whether the road capacity is sufficient for the number of
5 people evacuating, the amount of time necessary to implement a full evacuation, and

6 whether that time is acceptable to ensure the safety of Project guests, residents in the area,
7 and other users of Highway 120 who will be also be evacuating at the same time in the
event of a wildfire or other emergency.
d. The EIR fails to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impacts

10 on water supply. For example, the EIR's analysis was based on a few weeks of monitoring
11 conducted outside of the monitoring time period established by the State Water Quality
rainfall. As a result, the EIR could not 12 Control Board, and after a year of above average
13 adequately characterize the environmental conditions that prevail in the Project area, nor
14 could it accurately assess the effect that groundwater pumping for the Project will have on
15 existing groundwater supplies and surrounding wells during a critical dry water year or

16 during multiple dry years in a prolonged drought period. No alternative to the use of
17 project wells is ever discussed as an option in planning documents. Because the EIR failed
18 to identify the Project's potentially significant impacts on water supply, it failed to propose
19 mitigation necessary to address those impacts.

20 e. The EIR fails to adequately analyze or mitigate significant noise
21 impacts, including the failure to adequately characterize the existing noise environment
22 and the failure to identify sensitive receptors and to measure how noise levels from the

23 Project would affect these receptors, as well as the Project's impact on the exceptionally
24 quiet ambient conditions that currently exist at the Project site. The Project in combination
25 with the Terra Vi Lodge project directly across the street does pose a highly significant
26 increase in noise that was not a considered as a cumulative impact.

27 f. The EIR fails to adequately analyze or mitigate significant traffic and
28 traffic safety impacts. Among other deficiencies, the EIR failed to conduct any traffic
12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

1 study for the Project. Instead, the EIR relied on extremely limited, cherry-picked data from
2 a smaller, different project located in another state to claim Project traffic would not be
3 enough to require a study. As a result, the EIR included no analysis of traffic from the
4 Project; it failed to determine how the Project would affect traffic on Highway 120 and the
5 need for a left turn lane to accommodate Project traffic; it failed to properly account for
6 vehicle miles traveled and greenhouse gas emissions that would result from Project traffic,
7 it failed to assess traffic safety impacts; and it undermined the ability to properly evaluate
8 wildfire evacuation needs and impacts.

9 g. The EIR fails to adequately analyze or mitigate significant air quality
10 and climate change impacts, including the failure to account for the impacts from Project
11 traffic, construction and operations, the harvesting of timber and the cancellation of the
12 CalFire reforestation and GHG reduction grant agreement.
13 h. The EIR fails to adequately analyze or mitigate water quality impacts,
14 in particular impacts from the onsite treatment of millions of gallons of Project wastewater
15 each year and the impacts of Project runoff on wetlands and other surface water resources.

16 i. The EIR fails to adequately analyze housing impacts and impacts to
17 public services, including emergency response services. In addition to underestimating the
18 number of Project employees, the EIR fails to adequately assess impacts from the
19 employees it claims will be needed for the Project; and it improperly dismisses impacts to
20 further adding to the already significant delays in emergency response times and how
21 stressing over-stretched public services will affect the physical environment.

22 j. The EIR fails to adequately analyze or mitigate the Project's impacts
23 on biological resources, including impacts to sensitive species and wetlands.

24 k. The EIR fails to adequately analyze or mitigate significant cumulative
25 impacts, including but not limited to water quality and water supply, fire and fire safety, air
26 quality and greenhouse gas emissions, traffic and traffic safety, and noise. The Project is
27 just one of a number of new or expanded developments along the Highway 120 corridor,
28 yet the EIR dismisses the significance of the Project's cumulative impacts both by
13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

1 | underestimating impacts from the Project itself and by failing to evaluate how these
2  impacts will combine with those from other projects to impact the environment.

3 1. The EIR improperly defers analysis and mitigation of Project impacts,

4 including:

5 i. a reliance on a future emergency operations plan that fails to
6 include enforceable performance standards or to ensure safe evacuation in the event of an

7 emergency;

8 ii. reliance on an inadequate and uncertain plan for addressing

9 emergency response times;

10 iii. reliance a on a "Fire Prevention Plan" consisting of vague and

11 otherwise unenforceable measures: and

12 iv. reliance on the claim that the Project will comply with state
13 and local regulatory standards without providing any evidence that compliance with such
14 standards is feasible.

15 38. Respondents violated CEQA by failing to analyze a reasonable range of
16 project alternatives and by improperly rejecting feasible alternatives that would reduce the
17 Project's significant environmental impacts.

18 39. Respondents violated CEQA by failing to adequately respond to comments
19 on the EIR, including, but not limited to, failing to respond entirely to comments of two
20 well-established environmental organizations until the night before the Planning
21 Commission hearing, and by the County ignoring or rotely dismissing comments by
22 concerned citizens that identified laws in the County's analysis, requests for additional
23 information, and suggestions of feasible mitigation measures and alternatives.
24 40. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting inadequate findings. The County's
25 findings do not provide adequate reasoning or the analytic route from facts to conclusions,
26 as required by law. The County also failed to adopt findings regarding reliance on 1S09,
27 which is under the jurisdiction of another agency.

28 41. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
CASE NO.

discretion by certifying an EIR that does not comply with the requirements of CEQA and
2 precluded informed decision-making. As such, Respondents' certification of the EIR and
approval of the Project must be set aside.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

5 Violation of State Planning and Zoning Law

6 42. Petitioners reallege and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs

7 in their entirety.

43. Government Code section 65300 et. seq. requires the legislative body of each

9 county to adopt a general plan for the physical development of the unincorporated areas of
10 the county. The general plan must contain a statement of development policies, one or
11 more diagrams, and text setting forth objectives, principles, standards, and plan proposals
12 and must include mandatory elements. The general plan serves as a charter for future
13 development to which all other land use decisions must conform.
14 44. A conditional use permit and/or a site development permit must be consistent
15 with the County's General Plan.
16 45. The Project is inconsistent with the policies in the County General Plan
17 designed to minimize fire hazards, limit noise impacts, and require that commercial
18 development be connected to public utilities. For example, General Plan Policy 3.A.2
19 requires "new commercial development to be served by public water systems, except for
20 development in areas designated as Special Commercial on the General Plan land use
21 diagrams." The Project is indisputably a commercial development, but the Project site is
22 not designated as Special Commercial, and so the development is required to be served by
23 a public water system. The water system proposed for the Project does not meet the
24 definition of a public water system as defined by the County Code.

25 46. Respondents' approval of the Project therefore violates the requirements of
26 state law and is thus arbitrary and capricious and a prejudicial abuse of discretion. Because
27 Respondents did not proceed in the manner required by law and their decision was not
28 supported by substantial evidence, the approval of the Project should be set aside.

F THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of County Code)

3 47. Petitioners reallege and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs
4 in their entirety.

5 48. Tuolumne County Code section 17.72.220 provides that "[m]onitoring
6 and/or reporting plans for projects for which an EIR is prepared shall be included in the
7 draft EIR. The plan shall be subject to the same public review and comment afforded to all
8 other portions of the EIR.» (emphasis added).

9 49. The draft EIR for the Project failed to include a Mitigation Monitoring and
10 Reporting Program ("MMRP") as required by County code section 17.72.220.
11 50. By failing to include an MMRP in the DEIR, the County violated its own
12 code and deprived the public of a full opportunity to review and comment on the MMRP
13 along with the rest of the DEIR.
14 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

15 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:

16 1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to
17 vacate and set aside their certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

18 2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the Respondents
19  to comply with the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines and take any other
20 action as required by Public Resources Code section 21168.9, State Planning and Zoning

21 Law, and the County Code;
22 3. a For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and
23 permanent injunctions restraining Respondents, Real Parties in Interest, and their
24 representative agents, servants, and employees, and all others acting in concert with
25 Respondents or Real Parties in Interest or on their behalf, from taking any action to
26| implement the Project pending full compliance with the requirements of CEQA and the
27 CEQA Guidelines, State Planning and Zoning Law, and the County Code;

28 4. For costs of the suit;

Re: Notice of Commencement of CEQA and Planning and Zoning Law Litigation Challenging Approval of the Under Canvas Project
Dear Ms. Ryan:
This letter is to notify you that Save Sawmill Mountain and the Central Sierra Environmental Resource Center will file suit against the County of Tuolumne ("County") and its Board of Supervisors for failure to observe the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq., the CEQA Guidelines, California Code of Regulations section 15000 et seq., and
state law in connection with its December 17, 2020 approval of the Yosemite Under Canvas Project, Development Permit SDP18-002, Conditional Use Permit CUP20-018 and certification of an environmental impact report for the Project. This notice is given pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5.
Please note that, pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6, the
record of proceedings for County's actions includes, among other items, all "internal agency communications, including staff notes and memoranda related to the project or to compliance with [CEQA]." Because all e-mails, text messages, recordings, and other internal communications related to the Plan are part of the administrative record for the lawsuit to be filed by Petitioners, the County may not destroy or delete such documents prior to preparation of the record in this case.
Very truly yours,

SHUTE, MIHALY & WEINBERGER LLP
