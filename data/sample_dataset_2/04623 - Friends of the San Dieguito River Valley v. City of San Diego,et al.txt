SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS
2 1. FSDRV is a California Non-Profit Public Benefit Corporation. Established in 1986 as a
3 non-profit, and supported by a network of members and affiliates, FSDRV promotes and supports
4 conservation, restoration, preservation and enhancement of the natural scenic, ecological and open-
5 space resources of the San Dieguito River Valley through advocacy, study, monitoring,
6 and education. The members of FSDRV reside in or visit the San Dieguito River Valley in City of
7 San Diego and County of San Diego, State of California.
8 2. FSDRV believes in preserving and ensuring a quality of life by protecting the
9 environment, through wise planning, lawful stewardship of lands, and following the policies,
10 ordinances, and laws which apply to the San Dieguito River Valley in the City of San Diego. As
11 residents, community members, and visitors to the San Dieguito River Valley, members of FSDRV are
12 directly affected by the July 25, 2016, decision of Respondent to authorize an approximate 28 year
13 Ground Lease with Surf Cup Sports, LLC (*Surf Cup"), for the 114 acres of City-owned property
14 located at 14555 El Camino Real/14955 Via de la Valle known as the "Polo Fields" ("Project").
15 Respondent based this decision on its determination that the Project is covered by the General Rule,
16 California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Section 15061(b)(2) and (3), and is categorically
17 exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Sections 15323, 15301, 15304 and 15311, and that
18 an exception to the exemptions as set forth in CEQA Guidelines Section 15300.2 does not apply.
19 3. Subsequent to Respondent's approval of the Ground Lease and categorical exemptions, 20 Surf Cup has demolished temporary corrals and tack rooms, graded the road and other areas of the site, 21 disposed of stall bedding in native habitat, increased use of the site, removed trees, installed new chain
22 link fencing, added road bed material, constructed a new entrance off Via de la Valle, constructed a
23 new arena and trenched along the access road. There is no evidence the City has required or
24 considered any permits for this work.
25 4. FSDRV and its members are directly affected by the failure of the City of San Diego to 26 require permits for the ongoing activities on the Polo Fields. As the landowner the City is the 27

5 approving the Project and failing to require or consider permits for the ongoing activities.

6 Respondent's actions adversely affect the aesthetic, environmental, health, and safety interests of

7 FSDRV's members. The interests of FSDRV's members have been and will continue to be adversely

8 affected by Respondent's unlawful actions in violation of the Fairbanks Ranch Country Club Specific

9 Plan, San Diego Municipal Code, California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") and the Code of

15 the role of the governmental agency charged by law with administering the provisions of the San

16 Diego Mupicipal Code and the Public Resources Code Section 21000 et seq.
7.
17 FSDRV does not know the true names or capacity of the persons or entities sued herein

18 as Does 1 through 5, and therefore sues these Respondents by fictitious names. FSDRV will amend

19 the Petition to set forth names and capacity of said Respondents along with appropriate charging

20 allegations when the same have been ascertained.
8.
21 Real Party in Interest SURF CUP SPORTS, LLC ("Surf Cup") is California limited

22 liability company. SURF CUP SPORTS, LLC is identified as the intended lessee for the Polo Fields.
9.
23 At the time the Petition was filed OCEAN INDUSTRIES, INC. was the successor in

24 interest to the original developer Watt Industries of San Diego ("WISD") and had a beneficial interest

25 in the provisions of the deed granting the land to Respondent City of San Diego.
10.
26 Subsequent to the filing of the Petition for Writ of Mandate; OCEAN INDUSTRIES,

27 INC. transferred its interest in the grant deed to FAIRBANKS POLO CLUB HOMES ("HOA"), a

28 California Common Interest Developer. FAIRBANKS POLO CLUB HOMES has a beneficial

2 interest in the operation and management of the subject property and is now named as a Real Party-in- a

Interest.

7 amends the complaint to substitute FAIRBANKS POLO CLUB HOMES for DOE 6. FSDRV does

8 not know the true names or capacity of the persons or entities sued herein as Does 7 through 10, and

9 therefore sues these Real Parties in Interest by such fictitious names. FSDRV will amend the Petition

10 to set forth the names and capacity of said Real Parties in Interest along with appropriate charging

11 allegations when the same have been ascertained.

10 set forth herein in full.

11 35. City has committed to a definite course of action regarding the proposed Project and

14 cumulative impact of all components of the lease described above.

15 37. The City then failed to consider the environmental consequences of the Project at the

2 significant impact on biology, traffic, noise and water quality.
3 43. There is a reasonable possibility that the Project may have a significant effect on the
4 environment due to unusual circumstances. The Project site is located next to and includes habitat

14 the facility as cited above.

15 47. The Project does not meet the criteria of CEQA Guidelines section 15301 because Surf

16 Cup proposes to significantly increase the intensity of use on the project site and Surf Cup's use of the

21 components of the lease include the removal and/or replacement of every structure on the site and the

22 placement of new structures with no information regarding the size, location and design of these new

23 structures. The Project does not contemplate minor accessory structures; the Project allows significant

13 project site.

24 67. Under San Diego Municipal code section 121.0312(b), the City Manager shall order the
25 restoration of grading undertaken without a permit, unless technically infeasible. The restoration shall

11
SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

9 BMP's" adopted under San Diego Municipal Code section 43.0307(a).
10 71. The Percentage Ground Lease was approved by a resolution of the City Council. It is the
11 legal duty of the City to implement all resolutions passed by the City Council. The City's function is
12 now purely ministerial to require that Surf Cup implement and comply with the applicable BMPs
13 required by the San Diego Municipal Code.
14 72. Surf Cup has failed to implement and comply with the applicable BMPs required by the
15 San Diego Municipal Code and the City has failed to implement the requirements of the Percentage
16 Lease and hence the resolution adopted by the City Council. This failure to perform a ministerial duty
17 IS an abuse of discretion.
