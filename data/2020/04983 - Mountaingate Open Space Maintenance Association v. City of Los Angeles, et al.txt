Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 INTRODUCTION.

2 Petitioner Mountaingate Open Space Maintenance Association ("MOSMA" or
3 "Petitioner") alleges as follows:

4 1. In violation of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), and

5 Petitioner's right to notice and hearing, the City of Los Angeles ("City") and CalRecycle's

6 Local Enforcement Agency (the "LEA") failed to require the performance of all of the

7 environmental mitigation measures required prior to the issuance of construction permits for the

8 development approved pursuant to Tentative Tract 53072 in order to protect against fire danger

9 and hazardous methane emissions from Mission Canyon 8 Landfill (the "Landfill").

10 2. Specifically, the City and the LEA approved the issuance of grading permits for

11 Tentative Tract 53072 without ensuring the subdivider's compliance with Condition 113 of

12 Tentative Tract 53072, which requires that a Post Closure Plan for the Landfill be approved in

13 accordance Title 27 of the California Code of Regulations, Section 21190 by the LEA and

14 CalRecycle prior to the issuance of grading permits to mitigate public health and safety risks.

15 3. The Landfill is municipal solid waste landfill within the boundaries of Tentative

16 Tract 53072, which is located within a designated Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone

17 Condition. Solid waste landfilling operations were conducted at the Landfill until 1982.

18 Municipal solid waste landfills produce large quantities of landfill gas as the organic matter

19 undergoes anaerobic decomposition. The primary component of landfill gas is methane and

20 carbon dioxide. According to the LEA's own admissions, methane is a flammable gas with a

21 lower explosive level of 5 percent by volume in air and can also act as a simple asphyxiant. The

22 LEA also acknowledges that uncontrolled landfill gas can travel up to 1,000 feet from a landfill a

23 and can carry other trace compounds which can be hazardous at certain concentrations.

24 4. The Landfill is located adjacent to the Mountaingate community, which is

25 comprised of 300 single-family homes and recreational facilities ("Mountaingate"). In

26 December 2017, the Skirball Fire ravaged land around Mountaingate and the Landfill, burning

27 422 acres of land on the slopes of the Sepulveda Pass on its east side and causing the closure of

28 Interstate 405.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

5. On October 28, 2019, the Getty Fire erupted adjacent to Mountaingate and the
2 Landfill. The Getty Fire burned through the Landfill damaging a large section of the landfill gas
3 collection system.

4 6. The failure of the City and the LEA to require compliance with Condition 113
5 presents an imminent and continuing fire and health danger to Mountaingate and the nearby

6 community.

7 7. On December 5, 2019, Petitioner wrote to the City and LEA demanding that they
8 revoke the grading permits issued for Tentative Tract 53072 and that they enforce Condition

9 113, but they have failed to do so.

10 PARTIES TO THIS PROCEEDING.

11 8. Plaintiff Mountaingate Open Space Maintenance Association ("MOSMA" or
12 "Plaintiff*) is a California Nonprofit Mutual Benefit Corporation, located in Los Angeles
13 County, California. MOSMA is responsible for, among other things, oversight and management
14 of the common and open space areas of Mountaingate. Its members and beneficiaries include
15 the homeowners, homeowner associations and condominium associations annexed to
16 Mountaingate under its Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions. MOSMA is authorized to
17 pursue this action on behalf of its members.
18 9. Petitioner is informed, believes and thereon alleges that Real Party in Interest

20 53072, and is a subdivider of Tentative Tract 53072.
21 10. Petitioner is informed, believes and thereon alleges that Real Party in Interest
22 C&C Mountaingate, Inc. is the owner of all, or a portion of, the land that is subject to Tentative

24 11. At all times material thereto, Respondent City of Los Angeles ("City") was and is
25 a chartered city organized and existing under the laws of the State of California.
26 12. At all times material thereto, Respondent Local Enforcement Authority of Los
27 Angeles is the entity charged with carrying out the State function of ensuring the proper

1 permitting, operation and closure of solid waste facilities within the City of Los Angeles.

2 13. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Respondents sued herein

3 as DOES 1-50, inclusive, and therefore sues these Respondents by such fictitious names.

4 Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of fictitiously named
5 Respondents when ascertained. Petitioner is informed, believes and based thereon alleges that at

6 all times herein mentioned, Respondents, including Does 1-50, and each of them, were the

7 agents and employees of the City, and the acts complained of herein were done within the

8 course and scope of said agency, and employment.

9 14. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest

10 sued herein as DOES 50-100, inclusive, and therefore sues these Real Parties in Interest by such

11 fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of

12 fictitiously named Real Parties in Interest when ascertained. Petitioner is informed, believes and

13 based thereon alleges that at all times herein mentioned, Real Parties, including Does 50-100,

14 and each, of them were the owners of commercial condominium units at the Subject Property

16 course and scope of said agency.

17 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

18 15. This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to California Code of

19 Civil Procedure section 1085 and 1094.5 and Public Resource Code sections 21168 and
20 21168.5.

21 16. Venue in this Court is proper pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394, in
22 that Respondents are located within the County of Los Angeles.
23

24 CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT

25 17. The California Environmental Quality Act, found at Public Resources Code
26 Section 21000 et seq., is based on the principle that "the maintenance of a quality environment
27 for the people of this state now and in the future is a matter a of statewide concern." (Pub.
28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Resources Code, § 21000, subd. (a).)'

2 18. In CEQA, the Legislature has established procedures designed to achieve these
3 goals. These procedures provide both for the determination of and for full public disclosure of

4 the potential adverse effects on the environment of discretionary projects that governmental

5 agencies propose to approve. CEQA requires a description of feasible alternatives to such

6 proposed projects and feasible mitigation measures to lessen their environmental harm. (Pub.

7 Resources Code § 21002.)

8 19. The Guidelines require "all phases of project planning, implementation, and
9 operation" to be considered in the Initial Study for a project. (Guidelines §15063, subd. (a)(1).)
10 CEQA defines project as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a
11 direct physical change to the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change
12 in the environment." (Guidelines § 15378, subd. (a).)
13 20. CEQA is not merely a procedural statute. CEQA imposes clear and substantive
14 responsibilities on agencies that propose to approve projects, requiring that public agencies not
15 approve projects that harm the environment unless and until all feasible mitigation measures are

16 employed to minimize that harm. (Pub. Resources CodeS§ 21002, 21002.1, subd. (b).)
17 21. CEQA's procedural requirements include the requirements that mitigation
18 measures imposed on a project be fully enforceable and that they actually be enforced. (Pub.
19 Resources Code § 21081.6(b); Lincoln Place Tenants Ass'n v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 155
20 Cal.App.4th 425, 445 ["mitigation measures must be feasible and enforceable"]; Lincoln Place

21 Tenants Ass'n v. City of Los Angeles (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th 1491, 1508 ['"[m]itigating
22 conditions [were] not mere expressions of hope"]; Sierra Club v. County of San Diego (2014)
23 231 Cal.App.4th 1152, 1173; Federation of Hillside & Canyon v. City of Los Angeles (2000) 83
24 Cal.App.4th 1252, 126 ["'The purpose of these requirements is to ensure that feasible mitigation
25

26 CEQA authorizes and directs the State Office of Planning and Research to adopt guidelines for
27 the implementation of CEQA by public agencies. (Pub. Resources Code §21083.) These

28 guidelines are found at title 14, California Code of Regulations, Section 15000 et seq. ("Guidelines") and are binding on all state and local agencies, including Respondents.

measures will actually be implemented as a condition of development, and not merely adopted

2 and then neglected or disregarded"].)

3 22. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 by filing a

4 copy of this petition with the California Attorney General. A copy of that notice is attached as

5 Exhibit A. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by providing

6 the City with notice of intention to commence the action. A copy of that notice is attached as

7 Exhibit B. Petitioner elects to prepare the administrative record. A copy of that election is

8 attached as Exhibit C.

9 STATEMENT OF FACTS.

10 A. Background.

11 23. In or about May 2000, C&C filed applications with the City of Los Angeles

12 ("City") for the development of a residential project containing 29 residences on the Property

13 (the "Housing Project"), including applications for the approval of Tentative Tract 53072,
14 Major Plan Review, a General Plan Amendment and Vesting Zone Change (CPC 2000-2276-

15 GPA-VZC). An Environmental Impact Report (EIR 1999-3251-SUB) and Addendum thereto

16 were processed in connection with C&C's application for such approvals.

17 24. In the course of the City's review of C&C's applications, various parties

18 including but not limited to the LEA - submitted objections to the Environmental Impact Report

19 (EIR) based on concerns about potential risks to public health and safety arising from potential
20 development in and around Mission Canyon 8 Landfill, including without limitation, fire-safety

21 risks and risks from methane releases.

22 25. The LEA's concerns were specified in the LEA's September 17, 2003 letter

23 regarding the Draft EIR for Tentative Tract 53072:

24 "Methane [] is a flammable gas with a lower explosive level of 5 percent by volume in
25 air and can act as simple asphyxiant. Landfill gas naturally migrates away from the
26 landfill due to internal pressure created within the fill area. It has been documented that
uncontrolled landfill gas can travel up to 1,000 feet from a landfill and can carry other
27 trace compounds which can be hazardous at certain concentrations." (Comment 1.1,

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
6

P emphasis added)

2 "Many of the proposed homes on Stoney Hill Road are within a 1,000 feet of the closed
3 landfills and can be impacted by landfill gas if mitigation measures are not established. Of special concern are parcels 9-11 that are in the vicinity of landfill gas migration 4 probes, in which the LEA has, in the past, detected landfill gas over regulatory limits."
5 (Comment 1.1, emphasis added)

6 "The EIR is deficient in that it needs additional technical analysis of the potential impact
7 of landfill gas on the project."

8 "The EIR indicates that Mission Canyon Landfills #7 and #8 will be developed as an

9 emergency fire/secondary access road and that top deck of Mission Canyon Landfill #8 will be used for soil stockpile. This will require the landfill owner to revise the site's post-
10 closure maintenance and land use plan to incorporate the changes. The landfill security

11 must be designed to discourage unauthorized access by persons and vehicles." (Comment 1.3, emphasis added).
12 (LEA Letter re DEIR No. EIR-99-325 1-Sub.) 13

14 26. In response to such concerns and objections, the City Planning Commission added

15 Condition 113 as an environmental mitigation measure to Tentative Tract 53072.

16 27. Condition 113 provided in full that:

17 Prior to recordation of the final map, the subdivider shall submit a Post Closure Plan for 18 Mission Canyon 8 Landfill (Lot 32) for review and approval by the Responsible
19 Agencies, including the Local Enforcement Agency (Environmental Affairs Department), as the Post Closure Plan may be revised by approval of VTT 53072 and CPC 2000-2276- 20 VZC-GPA. A copy of the approved Post Closure Plan shall be submitted to the Advisory|
21 Agency.

22 28. As an environmental mitigation measure, recordation of the final map is required
23 prior to the issuance of grading permits by Condition 14 of Tentative Tract 53072. Thus, by
24 application of Conditions 14 and 113 prior to the issuance of grading permits a Post Closure
25 Plan is required to be approved.
26

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

C. Monteverdi Failed to Submit a Final Post Closure Land Use Plan that

2 Complied with Condition 113.

3 29. In November 2018, Monteverdi submitted a proposed Post Closure Land Use

4 obtained in preparation of a "Post Closure Land Use Plan."

5 30. On May 28, 2019, Monteverdi wrote the City Planning Department requesting

6 clearance of Condition 113 so that Monteverdi could obtain grading permits for the Housing
7 Project. (Email, Jonathan Lonner to Sarah Molina-Pearson, May 28, 2019 ['The LEA

8 Condition is the last Planning Condition required on the map, and will allow for our grading

9 permits to be signed-off. Which will in-turn allow the final grading conditions of the map to be

10 signed-off].)

11 31, On May 28, 2019, the LEA wrote Monteverdi, rejecting Monteverdi's proposed

12 Post Closure plan as not meeting the fundamental requirements for a Post Closure Plan. The

13 LEA expressly stated that its May 28th letter "should not be construed to be an authorization

14 from the LEA that the proposed use can or will be approved upon later submission of an actual

15 final Post Closure Land Use Plan (PCLU)." (Emphasis added.) The LEA stated that

16 CalRecycle would also need to concur in the LEA's approval of a Post Closure Plan prior to the

17 start of construction. The LEA stated "[t]his letter should not be construed as an approval in any

18 way of the conceptual plan."
19 32. "Finally," the LEA added, "please note that the PCLUP is required to be approved
20 by the LEA with concurrence of CalRecycle prior to the start of construction." (Emphasis

21 added)

22 D. The City Improperly Issued, and the LEA Improperly Allowed Issuance of,

23 Grading and Building Permits.

24 33. Notwithstanding the LEA's rejection of Monteverdi's proposed Post Closure Plan,

25 the Planning Department allowed grading permits to be issued and the final map to be recorded

26 and failed to enforce Condition 113. Such action constituted a violation of CEQA because it

27 was a modification of a mitigation measure without public notice, environmental review and

28

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE
8

1 opportunity to be heard, as well as an abrogation of the City's and LEA's responsibilities to

2 protect public health and safety.

3 34. On information and belief, the LEA improperly cooperated, or at least acquiesced,

4 in the issuance of grading permits and the approval of the final map in derogation of its clear
5 responsibility to protect public health and safety.

6 35. In June 2019, the City issued Building/Grading Permit Nos. 18030-10000-04949

7 and 18020-10000-02780 within Tentative Tract 50372 (APNs 4490-024-014; 4493-035-001;

8 4493-014-016, -022, -024, -029) without requiring prior compliance with Condition 113.

9 36. Petitioner was not notified of the issuance of the grading permits or the lack of
10 enforcement of Condition 113, and was not afforded an opportunity to be heard regarding the

11 City's actions.

12 37. As discussed earlier, on October 28, 2019, the Getty Fire erupted and burned
13 Mission Canyon Landfill 8. LEA Program manager David Thompson confirmed in a November
14 4, 2019 email that the fire burned through Mission Canyon Landfill 8, damaging "a large section
15 of the landfill gas collection system on this landfill." a As a result of the fire, 49 collection wells

16 were damaged or destroyed.

17 38. The absence of an approved Post Closure Plan - as a required environmental

18 mitigation measure condition precedent to the issuance of construction permits increased the risk

19 of fire damage and methane exposure to Mountaingate and the surrounding community from the
20 Getty Fire, and continues to increase such risks.

21 39. On December 5, 2019, Petitioner sent a letter to the City and to the LEA
22 requesting revocation of Building and Grading Permits for the Housing Project. On December

23 18, 2019, Petitioner discussed its request with representatives of the City. However, the City did
24 not revoke the Building and Grading Permits.

1 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 CEQA VIOLATION

3 (Against Respondents and Real Parties and DOES 1-100)

4 40. Petitioner refers to, re-alleges and incorporates herein each and every allegation

5 contained in prior paragraphs, as though set forth in full herein.

6 41. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy at law except to request the

7 Court require the City and Real Parties to comply with Condition 113 of Tentative Tract 53072.

8 42. The City, has a clear and present ministerial duty to comply with, and require Real

9 Parties to comply with, Condition 113 of the Vesting Tract Map.

10 43. The City has a clear and present duty to comply with the California Environmental

11 Quality Act (CEQA) prior to its failure to enforce Condition 113. CEQA requires that

12 mitigation measures imposed as a result of environmental review a be enforced in subsequent

13 proceedings.

14 44. Condition 113 was imposed as an environmental mitigation measure.

15 It is therefore mandatory. Compliance with CEQA was required to modify Condition 113

16 pursuant to Sierra Club v. County of San Diego (2015) 231 Cal.App.4th 1152 and similar cases

17 requiring enforcement of mitigation measures imposed pursuant to CEQA.

18 45. Therefore, the City violated CEQA by approving grading permits for Tentative

19 Tract 53072 without requiring adherence to Condition 113.
20 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:

21 a. For an alternative and permanent writ of mandate to compel the City to comply

22 with Condition 113 of Tract Map 53072;

23 b. For a Temporary Restraining Order, Preliminary Injunction and Permanent

24 Injunction restraining and enjoining the City and all officials and employees thereof, and Real

25 Parties in Interest from allowing any construction activities within Tentative Tract 50372 prior

26 to compliance with Condition 113;
