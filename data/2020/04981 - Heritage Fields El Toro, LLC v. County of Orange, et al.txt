Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Petitioner HERITAGE FIELDS EL TORO, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company

2 (hereafter "Heritage Fields"), brings this action on its own behalf, on behalf of the general public, and

3 in the public interest, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code

4 section 21168 or, in the alternative, pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085 and Public

5 Resources Code section 21168.5. Heritage Fields alleges as follows:

6 INTRODUCTION

7 1. Once again, the County of Orange (the "County") has taken actions that threaten the

8 successful completion of the master-planned Orange County Great Park (the "Great Park"), and is in

9 clear violation of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Res. Code Sections 21000 et seq.

10 ("CEQA").

11 2. On June 5, 2018, the Orange County Board of Supervisors approved the West Alton

12 Parcel Development Plan ("West Alton Plan" or "Project"), certified Environmental Impact Report

13 No. 621 (the "EIR") for the West Alton Plan, adopted related findings, a Statement of Overriding

14 Considerations, and a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program, and authorized County staff to

15 take necessary actions toward implementation of the West Alton Plan.

16 3. As Heritage Fields and others raised throughout the public comment period prior to its

17 certification, the EIR is incomplete, misleading, and inaccurate, and fails to fully and accurately

18 describe applicable regulations and standards and the West Alton Plan's consistency with those

19 regulations.

20 4. The West Alton Plan purports to be a development plan for the "West Alton Parcel", a

21 site consisting of approximately 44.16 acres of land in the City of Irvine ("City"). This property is

22 located ón the former Marine Corps Air Station El Toro Property ("MCAS El Toro Property"), a

23 4,700-acre former Marine base. The West Alton Plan contains development standards and design

24 guidelines, a and a "Conceptual Site Plan." The West Alton Plan authorizes Eight Hundred Three

25 (803) multi-family residential units and ancillary private uses across two development areas: the

26 21.98-acre northern piece, and the 10.34-acre southern piece. These development areas are separated

27 by a protected 11.84-acre Wildlife Corridor.

28

Gibson, Dunn 8 2
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

5. This lawsuit is a companion suit to Heritage Fields' existing Petition and Complaint

2 challenging the EI Toro 100-Acre Development Plan ("100-Acre Plan"), its inadequate

3 Environmental Impact Report No. 620, and the County's Disposition and Development Agreement

4 and Master Ground Lease with Lowe Enterprises Real Estate Group ("Lowe") covering the 100-Acre

5 Parcel.' Like the West Alton Parcel, the 100-Acre Parcel is land predominantly owned by the County

6 in the City of Irvine on the MCAS El Toro Property. The County has approved developing both

7 parcels for extensive private uses, with Lowe as the explicitly designated "Developer."

8 6. After its closure, Heritage Fields purchased the vast majority of the MCAS El Toro

9 Property from the United States Department of the Navy as part of the "Orange County Great Park"

10 (also referred to as "OC Great Park") transaction, which is transforming the former base into

11 commercial and residential development and more than a thousand acres of public park, with

12 Heritage Fields as the landowner and master developer of the residential development as well as most

13 of the planned commercial development. As part of this transaction, Heritage Fields conveyed

14 approximately 1,100 acres of the former MCAS EI Toro Property to the City and, in turn, the City

15 conveyed (or is in the process of conveying)---at no cost-land to the County, including the West
16 Alton Parcel and 100-Acre Parcel. The property set aside for the County was intended to be utilized

17 for County-related uses, as a public benefit, and has been so designated in the City-approved plans

18 and CEQA documents prepared with respect to the OC Great Park. In contrast to this intended

19 purpose, the 100-Acre Plan and now the West Alton Plan a would allow a private real estate developer

20 to develop the land for entirely private uses.

21 7. Like the EIR for the 100-Acre Plan, the County determined--in total disregard for

22 established principles of California lawthat the West Alton Plan was exempt from both the City

23 and County's General Plans, the City and County's Zoning Codes, review and approval by any

24 planning commission, and all other public hearing and notice provisions of the City and County.

25 Accordingly, the West Alton Plan was analyzed and approved without any consideration by any

26

27 1 The case was originally filed in Orange County Superior Court as Heritage Fields El Toro, LLC

28 V. County of Orange, et al., Case No. 30-2017-00960230-CU-TT-CXC, and was transferred to and is now pending in Sacramento County Superior Court as Heritage Fields El Toro, LLC v. County of Orange, et al., Case No. 34-2018-80002879-CU-WM-GDS.
Gibson, Dunn &
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

planning commission and without even so much as single noticed public hearing for City or County

2 planning review.

3 8. In other words, the County contends that the West Alton Plan and 100-Acre Plan stand

4 alone, are exempt from all standards and procedures applicable to every other development in the

5 State of California. In making this erroneous determination, the County compounded the error by

6 failing to analyze in the EIR the significant land use incompatibilities created by allowing the West

7 Alton Plan's private residential development, to replace the originally approved public and

8 agricultural/preservation uses for the property. Not only is the West Alton Plan inconsistent with the

9 current zoning in the City of Irvine, it is also inconsistent with the requirements of "Measure W" (a

10 citizen's initiative approved by the voters of the County in 2002, which reserved the subject property

11 for open space and public/educational uses). None of these land use inconsistencies was disclosed or

12 analyzed in the EIR as required by CEQA.

13 9. Moreover, the EIR failed to respond to comments raised by Heritage Fields and other

14 concerned members of the public, failed to make a good-faith effort at disclosure as required by

15 CEQA, ignored applicable City and County parkland standards, improperly segmented environmental

16 review, improperly deferred mitigation measures, and misrepresented the true provisions of the West

17 Alton Plan. Additionally, the County failed to recirculate the EIR as required by CEQA despite

18 revealing a complete reversal of the EIR's analysis of greenhouse gas emissions shortly before the

19 County Board of Supervisors approved the Project.

20 10. Beyond these myriad violations of CEQA, the unequivocally private uses approved by

21 the County violate the express language and clear intent of the 2003 City and County Pre-Annexation

22 Agreement ("Pre-Annexation Agreement"), which reserved the subject property for government uses,

23 such as a Youth and Family Resource Center, an animal shelter, childcare facilities, law enforcement

24 training facilities, and an emergency shelter. The County has also violated the Pre-Annexation

25 it Agreement because it has approved the Project without a current, enforceable, binding commitment

26 obligating the County to pay its fair share of infrastructure expenses, as required by a provision of the
27 agreement intended to benefit future users of the area such as Heritage Fields, the landowner and

2 master developer of the nearby Great Park Neighborhoods. Attached hereto as Exhibit
correct copy of the Pre-Annexation Agreement. is a true and

3 11. The Project is in the City's Great Park area, which is carefully governed by multiple
4 lagreements, including the City's Amended and Restated Development Agreement ("ARDA"), with,
5 inter alia, Heritage Fields. In the context of the ARDA, the City and Heritage Fields have allocated
6 responsibility for the funding and completion of the infrastructure and park improvements required to
7 bring the vision of the Orange County voters, to have a world-class public park, to fruition. The
8 ARDA balances many interests. Among other things, it requires the City to construct a large-scale
9 |public park in compliance with the Great Park Master Plan. The ARDA is premised on the recognition
10 that there is a finite amount of traffic capacity to accommodate future development, and a finite number
11 of infrastructure improvements to create that capacity. The available traffic capacity must
12 accommodate both the buildout of the oC Great Park, and the private development that was approved
13 as part of the OC Great Park planning process, in order to fund the dedication and contribution of $200
14 million towards the construction of the OC Great Park. As memorialized in Exhibit L of the ARDA,
15  and Exhibits B and C of the original Development Agreement dated July 12, 2005 between Heritage
16| Fields' direct predecessor in interest and the City ("DA"), the County's West Alton Parcel was
17 designated for agricultural and open space, and therefore expected to utilize only the traffic capacity
18 needed to accommodate these uses provided for in the Pre-Annexation Agreement between the County
19 and the City. The ARDA Overlay Plan provided that the West Alton Parcel was for agricultural uses;
20 land Section 3.8.1 of the ARDA states City ordinances, resolutions, regulations and official policies
21 adopted or approved after July 12, 2005 pursuant to procedures provided by law which do not conflict
22 with the Existing Land Use Regulations, the ARDA Overlay Plan, and this Amended and Restated
23 Agreement shall apply to and govern development of the Property[.]" Pursuant to the Definitions in
24 Section of the ARDA, the term "Property" includes the West Alton Parcel. The County never
25 disputed the substance of Exhibit L of the ARDA or Exhibits B and C of the DA or the assumptions in
26  the 2003 EIR prepared in connection with the OC Great Park. The amount of development associated
27 with the Project requires far more traffic capacity than was assumed in the 2003 EIR for the OC Great
28 Park, or in the ARDA. If the County improperly utilizes the traffic capacity needed for completion of

Crutcher LLP 5

|the OC Great Park by building the Project, the City will not be able to fulfill its contractual
2 commitment to Heritage Fields to complete the OC Great Park. By approving the Project, which is
3 inconsistent with the West Alton Parcel's permitted uses set out in Exhibit L to the ARDA and Exhibits
4 B and C of the DA, the County has committed acts of governance that intentionally interfere with the
5 ARDA such that the City will be unable to construct the OC Great Park as required by the ARDA, or

6 meet its other obligations with respect to Heritage Fields. Attached hereto as Exhibit 2 is a true and
7 Icorrect copy of the ARDA. Attached hereto as Exhibit 3 is a true and correct copy of the DA.

8 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

a 12. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1094.5 of the Code of

10 Civil Procedure and section 21168 of the Public Resources Code.

11 13. This Court also has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1085 of the Code of

12 Civil Procedure, and section 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

13 14. Venue for this action properly lies in the Orange County Superior Court because the

14 property on which the West Alton Plan is located is in the County of Orange.
15 15. This petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167

16 and CEQA Guidelines section 15112.

17 PARTIES

18 16. Petitioner and Plaintiff HERITAGE FIELDS is the owner of land within the MCAS EI

19 Toro Property, which is immediately adjacent to the West Alton Parcel on which the new

20 development would take place. Heritage Fields is the master developer of the entirety of the MCAS

21 El Toro Property, including the 100-Acre Parcel and the Great Park Neighborhoods, which are both

22 within the boundaries of the former MCAS El Toro Property. Heritage Fields' direct predecessor in
23 interest purchased the MCAS El Toro Property from the United States Department of the Navy, and

24 as part of the original entitlement process, Heritage Fields conveyed more than 1,100 acres of former

25 MCAS El Toro Property to the City and contributed substantial financial resources toward the

26 coordinated development of a great metropolitan park, now known as the "Orange County Great

27 Park" that is intended to provide cultural, athletic, recreational, agricultural and aesthetic amenities to

28 residents throughout Southern California. Heritage Fields, which is an intended beneficiary of the

6 Gibson, Dunn &
Crutcher LL VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Pre-Annexation Agreement, is directly and adversely affected by development that does not

2 contribute its fair share toward parkland, roadway, infrastructure, and other public improvements, and
3 that would be incompatible with the significant investments Heritage Fields has made to building the

4 Orange County Great Park and Great Park Neighborhoods.

5 17. On information and belief, Respondent and Defendant COUNTY OF ORANGE is a
political subdivision of the State of California, and is the lead agency under CEQA for the West

7 Alton Plan.

8 18. On information and belief, Real Party in Interest LOWE ENTERPRISES REAL

9 ESTATE GROUP ("Lowe"), a California corporation, is the "Developer for the County's El Toro

10 parcels," including the West Alton Parcel.

11 19. The names and capacities, whether corporate, individual, or otherwise, of Defendants

12 Does through 100, inclusive, are unknown to Heritage Fields at this time. Heritage Fields therefore

13 sues these Defendants, and each of them, by such fictitious names. Heritage Fields will seek leave of

14 court to amend this complaint to show the true names and capacities of the Doe Defendants when

15 they are fully ascertained. Heritage Fields is informed and believes that the Doe Defendants are

16 responsible and liable to Heritage Fields for the events, happenings and occurrences set forth herein.

17 STATEMENT OF FACTS

18 20. Following thè decision by the Department of the Navy in 1993 to close the nearly

19 4,700-acre Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, the County sought to pursue a large-scale commercial

20 airport on the MCAS EI Toro Property. Instead, to ensure that Orange County would receive a

21 regional park, the voters of Orange County decisively halted the County's plan by approving Measure
22 W on March 5, 2002. Measure W changed the allowed reuse of the MCAS El Toro Property to a

23 plan consisting exclusively of educational, recreational, open space, cultural and other public uses as
24 long as the land remained unincorporated. To guarantee that the Board of Supervisors would honor

25 those plans, Measure W enshrined those protections in the County General Plan and required that any

26 change of that designation while the land remained unincorporated must be submitted to a vote of the

27 people.

28

Gibson, Dunn & 7
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

21. In 2003, the City, former Irvine Redevelopment Agency, and County entered into a

2 Pre-Annexation Agreement, which was intended to facilitate the City's annexation of the vast
majority of the former MCAS El Toro Property, and the ultimate transfer of the land to future owners

4 and developers of the MCAS El Toro Property (the role ultimately secured by Heritage Fields' direct

5 predecessor in interest after it purchased the MCAS El Toro Property). To achieve that end, the Pre-

6 Annexation Agreement provided that:

7 The County agrees to pay its fair share of costs as part of the funding

8 mechanism [City] was to set up to fund the costs of building "necessary infrastructure and related improvements.* (Section 2.2.5.)

9 [City] will provide "through a Development Agreement between Irvine and

10 the purchaser(s) of El Toro property" (now Heritage Fields) for the conveyance of certain parcels to the County in the manner prescribed in the
11 Pre-Annexation Agreement. (Section 2.2.3.4.)

12 The City and County would "agree to cooperate and work together with the Navy to cause the expeditious transfer of the El Toro property." (Section 4.)
13 22. In exchange for the County's agreement to allow the City to annex the vast majority of
14 the former MCAS El Toro Property, the City agreed to zone the County's parcels, including the West

:15 Alton Parcel, for the "exclusive use of the County or its designees, lessees, or concessionaires ... to

16 construct and operate permitted uses and facilities." (Section 2.2.3.1.) The "permitted uses and

17 facilities" are defined in the Pre-Annexation Agreement by reference to "the attached Exhibit titled

18 MCAS EI Toro: Proposed County Acquisitions," which identifies the uses permitted on the West

19 Alton Parcel as "County Facilities." (Section 2.2.3 ; Exhibit.) The Pre-Annexation Agreement also

20 describes these uses as the "County's regional facilities," whereby "[t]he City will . .. provide for

21 land use designations that will allow for the intended uses indicated on the attached Exhibit."

22 (Section 2.2.3; Exhibit.)

23 23. Section 2.2.4 of the Pre-Annexation Agreement further provides that "Irvine will zone

24 County's parcels and designate them in Irvine's General Plan, in accordance with County direction."

25 In addition, the "County shall retain exclusive land use control over [its parcels within the MCAS EI

26 Toro Property], and shall be entitled to place any development upon said parcels that County shall

27 determine to be desirable for County's needs, as though said property remained unincorporated,

28 without the obligations for payment to Irvine of any permit fees or other mitigation/impact fees, other

Gibson, Dunn & 8
Grutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

than in Section 2.2.5, including but not limited to the following uses, all of which Irvine agrees with:

2 Animal shelter; Environmental health facilities; Automotive / equipment repair facilities; childcare

3 facilities; youth and family resource center; Law enforcement training facilities; emergency shelter;

4 Transitional shelter care facility; Children & Family Services Center; Business offices; Warehouses;

5 Storage facilities; Vehicle parking and storage facilities; Heavy equipment and storage; Field

6 operations and maintenance facility."

7 24. Consistent with the process first established by the Pre-Annexation Agreement, the

f City and the purchaser of the MCAS El Toro Property (Heritage Fields' direct predecessor in interest)

9 entered into the DA governing the future development of the MCAS EI Toro Property. The DA was

10 subsequently amended and restated in December 2010 in the Amended and Restated Development

11 Agreement ("ARDA"). Both the DA and the ARDA were adopted pursuant to Section 65864 et seq.

12 of the California Government Code (the "Development Agreement Statute"), which authorizes local

13 agency to vest a property owner's development rights on its property in accordance with the land use

14 regulations and zoning/land use designations applicable at the time the development agreement was

15 entered into. At the time the DA and the ARDA were entered into, the zoning designations

16 applicable to the West Alton Parcel were Preservation and Exclusive Agriculture. The DA was

17 recorded on July 12, 2005 by Heritage Fields against that portion of the West Alton Parcel that was

18 conveyed by the Navy to Heritage Fields before that property was conveyed by Heritage Fields to the

19 City prior to recordation of the ARDA. Heritage Fields' conveyance of the property to the City was

20 made subject to the land use restrictions of the DA. The ARDA was recorded on December 27, 2010

21 by Heritage Fields against that remaining portion of the West Alton Parcel that was conveyed by the

22 Navy to Heritage Fields before that property was conveyed by Heritage Fields to the City. The City

23 also recorded the ARDA over that portion of the former MCAS El Toro Property depicted in Exhibit

24 A to the ARDA, which portion includes all the West Alton Parcel. Heritage Fields' conveyance of

25 the remaining portion of the West Alton Parcel to the City was made subject to the land use

26 restrictions in the ARDA. The City subsequently conveyed that portion of the West Alton Parcel to

27 the County subject to the land use restrictions set forth in the ARDA.

28

Gibson, Dunn & 9
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

25. Section 7.9 of the ARDA further acknowledged the County's obligation set forth in

2 the Pre-Annexation Agreement to pay for its fair share of infrastructure improvements, required the

3 City to actively enforce these provisions of the Pre-Annexation Agreement, and recognized the fact

4 that nothing in the Development Agreement should be deemed as a "waiver by Heritage Fields of any

5 rights Heritage Fields" has against the County with respect to enforcing the Pre-Annexation

6 Agreement. This acknowledgment was confirmed in a letter agreement from the City to Heritage

7 Fields executed December 27, 2019, which clarified section 7.9 of the ARDA recognized the

8 County's fair-share payment obligations under the Pre-Annexation Agreement, the City's obligation

9 to ensure compliance with the Pre-Annexation Agreement and implementing agreements, and that
10 Heritage Fields had not reduced any of its rights thereunder.

11 26. In 2006, the County acknowledged the limited uses to which the West Alton Parcel

12 may be put, writing to the Orange County Grand Jury that:

13 Irvine agreed to the County sharing in a certain percentage of the
14 property taxes as well as receipt of certain parcels of property, totaling approximately 240 acres to be used for certain County purposes such as
15 Youth and Family Resource Center, an animal shelter, childcare facilities, law enforcement training facilities, and an emergency shelter.
16 27. Eight years after this admission and more than ten years after the Pre-Annexation

17 Agreement was enacted, on January 28, 2014, the County Board of Supervisors approved a

18 Disposition and Development Agreement with Lowe as the Developer of both the County's West

19 Alton Parcel and a parcel of land also conveyed to the County pursuant to the Pre-Annexation

20 Agreement, the "100-Acre Parcel," that is immediately adjacent to Heritage Fields' property On

21 information and belief, Lowe proceeded to create development plans that would allow for the

22 development of private dwellings on the West Alton Parcel and a combination of private offices,
23 private dwellings, private retail, and private hotel uses on the 100-Acre Parcel.

24 28. A Notice of Preparation of a Draft EIR was released by the County and was filed with

25 the State Clearinghouse on December 19, 2014. The Draft EIR was released for a 60-day review a

26 period on December 9, 2016. Sixteen governmental agencies and corporate or organizational

27 entities-including Heritage Fields---submitted comment letters during the review period raising a

•28 myriad of defects with the EIR, including but not limited to a failure to (i) accurately identify the

Gibson, Dunn & 10
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 proper land use jurisdiction over the West Alton Parcel, (ii) adequately mitigate significant impacts to

2 parks and recreational uses in neighboring jurisdictions, (iii) accurately disclose inconsistencies with

3 applicable land use and air quality regulations, (iv) properly mitigate traffic impacts, (v) properly

4 analyze, disclose and mitigate air quality and greenhouse gas emission impacts, and (vi) properly

5 mitigate against impacts to the wildlife corridor.

6 29. On May 23, 2018, the County released a Notice of Completion of the Final EIR, but

7 did not mail a copy of the Notice to Heritage Fields. Heritage Fields learned of the completion of the

8 Final EIR and its scheduled June 5, 2018 approval date before the Board of Supervisors just shortly

9 before June 5. By failing to provide the legally required notice, the County deprived Heritage Fields

10 of a full opportunity to review the EIR and provide additional comments to the Board of Supervisors.
11 30. Buried in the responses and revisions to the Draft EIR is a complete reversal of the

12 EIR's conclusions with respect to greenhouse gas emissions. The EIR does not fully explain this

13 conclusory reversal of position, and the cursory analysis contains substantive errors that the public

14 was never afforded the opportunity to comment on.

15 31. Omitted from these documents was any substantive County response to the objection

16 raised repeatedly by numerous commenters-including Heritage Fields-that the EIR's assumption

17 that the County, and not the City, has land use jurisdiction over the West Alton Parcel is incorrect as

18 a matter of law. Therefore, the County has not proceeded in a manner according to law, in violation

19 of CEQA.

20 32. On June 5, 2018, the Board of Supervisors heard objections to the West Alton Plan

21 from public speakers and received additional comment letters reiterating previous objections and

22 identifying new failures to comply with CEQA arising from the Final EIR's responses to comments.
23 The County Board of Supervisors nevertheless certified the EIR, adopted the Statement of Overriding
24 Considerations, and approved the West Alton Plan.

25 33. A Notice of Determination was filed by the County on June 5, 2018.

Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

2 34. Heritage Fields objected to the West Alton Plan in the administrative proceedings, and

3 fully exhausted its administrative remedies, including the submission of at least two letters raising

4 issues with the adequacy of the EIR and objections to the legally flawed process.

5 35. Either Heritage Fields or other commenters in the CEQA administrative process raised

6 all factual and legal issues asserted under CEQA in this Petition. Heritage Fields has thus exhausted

7 all administrative remedies available to it, or such exhaustion is otherwise futile.

8 36. Heritage Fields has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by

9 providing the County with notice of its intention to commence the action. Proof of service of the

10 notice is attached as Exhibit 4. A copy of this Petition is being sent by registered mail to the Attorney

11 General of the State of California.

12 37. Heritage Fields elects to prepare the administrative record. A copy of that election is
13 attached as Exhibit 5.

14 38. On August 31, 2018, Heritage Fields submitted a Claim for Money or Damages
15 Against the County of Orange (pursuant to Government Code section 910 et seq) (the "Claim

16 Form"). The County did not respond to the Claim Form within 45 days. A copy of the Claim Form

17 is attached hereto as Exhibit 6.

18 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

19 (Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act Against Respondent and Real

20 Party in Interest)

21 39. Heritage Fields incorporates paragraphs 1 through 38 of this Petition as though fully

22 set forth herein.

23 County's Failure to Provide Adequate Notice of the EIR's Notice of Completion

24 40. California Public Resources Code section 21092.2 requires a lead agency to mail

25 notices to persons who make a written request to the appropriate person at the agency for such

26 notices.

2 Estate/Land Development, Heritage Fields requested a copy of the Notice of Completion prepared for

3 the West Alton Plan EIR by reference to Section 21092.2 of the Public Resources Code.

4 42. The County issued the Notice of Completion on May 23, 2018, but did not provide the
required Notice to Heritage Fields or otherwise substantially comply with the requirements of section

6 21092.2.

7 43. As a result, Heritage Fields only learned of the Notice of Completion by happenstance

8 close to June 5, 2018, the date that the County Board of Supervisors was scheduled to consider
certification of the EIR. By failing to provide the legally required notice, the County deprived

10 Heritage Fields of a full opportunity to review and provide additional comments on the EIR to the

11 Board of Supervisors.

12 44. Because there was no compliance with section 21092.2, the County should not have

13 certified the EIR on June 5, 2018, and should have allotted more time for Heritage Fields' review and

14 comment on the Final EIR. The EIR's certification should be invalidated for this reason.

15 The EIR Impermissibly Piecemealed Analysis: The West Alton Plan and 100-Acre Plan

16 Are One Project

17 45. CEQA Guidelines Section 15378 defines a project to mean the "whole of an action."

18 CEQA prohibits the segmenting of a project into smaller components to avoid the risk that

19 environmental impacts from each project segment will be "submerged," potentially leading to

20 cumulatively "disastrous consequences.'

21 46. The County impermissibly splits the West Alton and 100-Acre portions of the Lowe

22 Development Project into two separate EIRs, released just weeks apart, despite the fact that Lowe has

23 the exclusive right to engage in a comprehensive development scheme for both the 100-Acre Parcel

24 and the West Alton Parcel pursuant to the same Disposition and Development Agreement ("DDA")

25 with the County. The DDA expressly defines the Lowe development scheme covering the 100-Acre

26 Property and the West Alton Parcel as a single "Project." Indeed, page 1 of the DDA defines the

27 "project" as Entitlements which "will permit the development of an economically viable, mixed-used

28 development for the Property." The definition of the term "Project" unambiguously refers to a single

Gibson, Dunn & 13
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- mixed-use development project. And "Property" is depicted and described in Exhibit A of the DDA

2 as including both the 100-Acre Parcel and the West Alton Parcel. Moreover, the development plans

3 for both portions of the project were prepared by Lowe.

4 47. The two property components not only share the same developer, they are both located

5 on the former MCAS El Toro Property, utilize the same roadways, require similar amendments to the

6 same City Planning Area 51 zoning regulations, and are governed by the same ARDA. They also

7 share the same architect/planner and contain largely parallel Development Plans. Lowe's

8 development timeline (Exhibit F to F the DDA) treats the development of the West Alton Parcel and

9 100-Acre Parcel as a single component and even appears to anticipate a single CEQA review process:

10 Lowe's Task is to conduct a Site Assessment for both the 100-Acre and
West Alton Parcel concurrently; 11
Lowe's Task 2 is to create a (singular) "Master Plan/Specific Plan" for both 12 the 100-Acre and West Alton Parcel concurrently;
13 Lowe's Task 3 is to evaluate infrastructure and financing for both the 100- Acre and West Alton Parcel concurrently; 14
Lowe's Task 4 is to conduct research and technical studies for both the 100- 15 Acre and West Alton Parcel concurrently;
16 Lowe's Task 5 is to comply with CEQA for both the 100-Acre and West Alton Parcel concurrently; and 17
Lowe's Task 6 is to gain entitlements for both the 100-Acre and West Alton 18 Parcel concurrently.

19 48. Given the integrated nature of the development plan for the two properties, one EIR

20 should have analyzed both projects, and the County's failure to do SO represents impermissible

21 segmentation of a unified project.

22 The Project Description Inaccurately Describes the County's Role in the West Alton

23 Plan

24 49. The EIR wrongly asserts that the County Board of Supervisors is the decision-making

25 body and effectively the CEQA applicant for the West Alton Plan. However, a private developer is

26 the real-party-in-interest and proponent of the development plans for the West Alton and 100-Acre

27 parcels.

28

14 Gibson, Dunn &
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

50. The County uses this sleight of hand in an attempt to evade both City and County land

2 use regulations. California law does not a allow a private developer to override local land use

3 jurisdiction simply because that private developer is building on land owned by the County. Nor

4 could the County, when acting in a proprietary capacity as the owner of the land, and separate from

5 its core governmental mission, act in a manner contrary to the regulations of the applicable municipal

6 government.

7 51. Here, a private developer's plan was the basis for the West Alton Plan, and the uses

8 are similar to other private development. Lowe is the formally approved author of the West Alton

9 Plan, and the development plan consistently anticipates that private applicants will implement the

10 West Alton Plan.

11 52. By characterizing the West Alton Plan as a County a project, the EIR misrepresented the

12 project and misled the public.

13 The EIR Fails to Accurately Describe the Land Use Jurisdiction Applicable to the West

14 Alton Plan and Fails to Make : Good-Faith Effort to Disclose Conflicts with Applicable

15 General Plan and Zoning Ordinances

16 53. CEQA requires that a lead agency conduct an adequate environmental review prior to
17 approving a discretionary project. This duty includes an obligation to make a good-faith effort at full

18 disclosure to the public of all significant environmental effects that may occur as a result of the

19 Project.

20 54. The EIR identifies Land Use/Planning as an appropriate environmental topic for
21 impacts analysis, and purports that the West Alton Plan's first objective is to build a project that is
22 compatible with the surrounding existing and planned land uses in the area.

23 55. But the EIR fails to make a good-faith effort to evaluate potential "conflicts with any
24 applicable land use plan, policy or regulation of an agency with jurisdiction over the project," as

25 required by CEQA and the EIR's Threshold 4.10-1. The EIR's failure to accurately describe this

26 impact renders the EIR inadequate and in violation of CEQA.

27 56. Any sufficient analysis of the West Alton Plan's consistency with applicable land use

28 controls requires the EIR to identify which land use controls apply. The EIR took the unsupportable

Gibson, Dunn : 15
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 position that the Project is exempt from any land use requirements, including but not limited to City

2 and County General Plan and zoning requirements. All analysis in the EIR that flows from this

3 erroneous conclusion is necessarily flawed.

4 57. Due to this extraordinary position that the West Alton Plan is exempt from all

5 planning, zoning, and land use regulations, the EIR fails to accurately disclose which plans are

6 applicable to the Project site. The EIR never provides an answer as to how land use impacts are to be

7 measured given that the EIR does not even disclose the policies and standards applicable to the

8 project.

9 58. Moreover, this position is contradicted elsewhere in the EIR. For example, the EIR

10 rejected Caltrans' comment that different thresholds of significance should be used by responding

11 that the West Alton Parcel is within the City and so City thresholds of significance should govern.

12 But elsewhere, the EIR rejects the use of City thresholds as inapplicable by arguing that the City has

13 no jurisdiction over the site. This position is also directly contradicted by the DDA (Exhibit F),

14 which requires Lowe to (among other tasks) (a) submit applications to the City of Irvine for a General

15 Plan Amendment, Zone Change(s), and Master Plan; (b) process through approval, a Tentative Tract

16 Map for the 100 Acre Parcel and Alton Parcels; and (c) negotiate a Development Agreement between

17 the County and City, if required.

18 59. Identification of the jurisdictions having land use authority over the Project is directly

19 relevant to CEQA analysis generally and to this EIR in particular, and the County's position that no

20 authority applies is contrary to law.

21 60. There is no immunity for private parties with respect to their own private pursuits

22 merely because a County happens to be the private party's landlord. Accordingly, the West Alton

23 Parcel, like all of its similarly situated neighboring properties, should be subject to City oversight and

24 regulation, and City standards and thresholds of significance should be utilized in all the EIR

25 analyses, and they were not. The EIR also did not fully or accurately identify the Project's

26 inconsistency with the City's TTOD Zoning, and thus failed to make the good-faith effort at

27 disclosure required by CEQA.

28

Gibson, Dunn ì 16
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

61. Alternatively, if the language of the Pre-Annexation Agreement stating that the West

2 Alton Parcel is to be treated as though it is unincorporated is correct, County's regulations, plans, and

3 standards must apply. And, as noted in the recitals to the Pre-Annexation Agreement, the County's

4 Measure W applied open space and public use land use designations to the Property. The West Alton

5 Plan complies with none of these use restrictions and none of these development standards.

6 The EIR Inaccurately Analyzes the Project's Provision of Parkland

7 62. The EIR is required to evaluate significant impacts to existing park facilities that will

8 be caused by, for example, increased use of existing park facilities due to an insufficient supply of

9 parks provided by a new development.

10 63. The EIR fails to accurately or consistently evaluate the Project's provision of parkland

11 under this standard. First, Topical Response 3.1.5 (Parks) makes internally contradictory

12 interpretations of CEQA thresholds and obfuscates which standard the EIR is using to measure

13 impacts: just before it cites to the County zoning standards as the measure of determining a

14 significant impact under CEQA, the Response states that "neither the City's nor the County's typical
15 parkland standards apply to the proposed Project."

16 64. The Project is plainly inconsistent with the City's park standards, which are the

17 standards that should apply because the West Alton Parcel is located within the City. While the

18 County standard only requires 2.5 acres of parkland per 1,000 people, the City standards require

19 minimum of five acres per 1,000 people (consisting of two acres of community parks and three acres

20 of neighborhood parks).

21 65. Additionally, the Final EIR's parkland analysis incorrectly identifies Beacon Park and

22 Pavilion Park as "public," and both are private parks. This is not a technical error. Failing to identify

23 these parks as private means the EIR wrongly assumes and informs the public that these parks will be

24 available to serve residents of the West Alton plan, and they will not. Therefore, the EIR does not

25 properly analyze and disclose the impacts of the potential new residents on existing park facilities.

Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

The EIR' Public Services Analysis Is Deficient Because Impacts on Schools Are Greater

2 Than Disclosed and Inadequately Mitigated

3 66. The EIR assumes that the current capacity in the three Irvine Unified School District

4 schools assigned to the Project site is available to accommodate students that would be generated by

5 the Project, and hence that the students generated "would not exceed the available capacity of the

6 schools that would serve the Project." The analysis ignores the fact that attendance in these schools,

7 or any of the other new schools built by Heritage Fields, will be taken up by students from existing,

8 previously approved and fully vested projects within the boundaries of the School District, so the

9 analysis is flawed.

10 67. Further, the failure of Lowe and the County to enter into a mitigation agreement with

11 the School District means that (1) students from the West Alton Plan may lack access to the schools

12 identified in the EIR, and (2) the School District will have to construct additional school facilities

13 and/or redirect Project students to schools farther from the Project. The impacts of these reasonably
14 foreseeable consequences of the Project were not adequately analyzed in the EIR.

15 68. The Project makes no commitment to provide necessary school facilities, and

16 impermissibly defers analysis to a later date.

17 The EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze or Mitigate Traffic Impacts

18 69. As pointed out in Heritage Fields' comment letter, the EIR does not depict the most

19 recently approved vested tentative tract maps for the Great Park Neighborhoods; therefore, it does not-

20 disclose-let alone analyze-the insufficient intersection spacing that the Project would create along
21 Irvine Boulevard between the primary and secondary entrances into the Project site.

22 70. The EIR acknowledges that the Project will contribute to significant traffic impacts,
23 and So mitigation is required. CEQA requires that mitigation measures be feasible and enforceable,

24 including with respect to legal impediments.
25 71. The Pre-Annexation Agreement provided that the West Alton Parcel should be zoned

26 to allow use as a "Sheriff Agriculture & Habitat Mitigation Area," and the land is presently zoned as

27 Preservation and Exclusive Agriculture. Because of this agricultural/preservation designation, none

28 of the regional infrastructure studies, including those prepared for the North Irvine Transportation

Gibson, Dunn & 18
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES,
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Mitigation Program ("NITM") and the Southern California Association of Governments' RTP/SCS,

2 accounted for traffic or other impacts that would be generated by the proposed residential

3 development on this Project site. And neither the County nor Lowe are members of NITM.

4 72. Rather than mitigating the significant traffic impacts, the Draft EIR provided that the

5 County will either requést that it become a member of NITM or enter into a separate agreement with

6 the City. Recognizing this deficiency, the County dramatically re-worked the transportation

7 mitigation measures in the Final EIR to provide that the County would conduct a vaguely defined fee

8 reallocation study to establish the Project's fair share traffic mitigation fees. However, the Final EIR
establishes no standards for this fee reallocation study, and thus decision makers and members of the

10 public--including Heritage Fields--that rely on the NITM program are left wondering what (if.

11 anything) this fee reallocation study will accomplish.

12 73. Revised mitigation measure MM TRAN-3 fails to meet CEQA's standards and fails to

13 resolve the fundamental flaw of the mitigation measure's original iteration because it continues to

14 require a future agreement to be reached between the City of Irvine and the County, but fails to

15 provide how fair share payments will be made if no such agreement is reached. The evidence does

16 not demonstrate that this measure will actually require Lowe and the County to mitigate the Project's

17 significant traffic impacts.

18 74. Moreover, CEQA Guidelines Section 15088.5 requires an environmental impact report
19 to be recirculated when "significant new information is added to the EIR" after it is released for
20 public comment but before it is certified. By dramatically altering the mitigation measure without

21 providing a meaningful opportunity for the public to review the new information, the County failed to

22 proceed in the manner required by law.
23 75. This mitigation measure is wholly inadequate because it does not address what
24 happens if the County and/or Lowe are unable to reach the contemplated agreements, and the EIR
25 does not adequately specify the contents of the agreement. This leaves the adequacy and actual terms
26 of the mitigation obligation entirely uncertain and renders the assurances of mitigation illusory.

-'

2 The EIR Improperly Defers Mitigation and Analysis to Subsequent Environmental
Reviews That May Never Occur

76.

4 Topical Response 3.1.3 asserts that future development applications will be subject to
CEQA. However, as explained in that Topical Response, the West Alton Plan provides that

6 "decisions made by the Chief Real Estate Officer or the El Toro Review Board on such appeals are
final."

77:

8 Further, only the applicant, property owner, or ground lessee who submitted a written

9 comment during the courtesy review period may file an appeal. Thus, the subsequent public review

10 right is not meaningful, and does not make up for the failure to adequately disclose the known or

11 reasonably foreseeable impacts of the Project at this stage of the environmental review process.

12 The Greenhouse Gas Impact Conclusion Is Unsupported By Substantial Evidence and

13 the EIR Must Be Recirculated Due to the Addition of Significant New Information
78.

14 CEQA Guidelines Section 15088.5 requires an environmental impact report to be

15 recirculated when "significant new information is added to the EIR" after it is released for public
comment but before it is certified.

16 79.

17 The Final EIR reversed the conclusion of the Draft EIR with respect to whether the

18 a West Alton Plan would cause a significant impact on greenhouse gas emissions. The Draft EIR had

19 concluded that there would be significant and unavoidable impacts, but the Final EIR reversed this

20 conclusion. The Final EIR fails to fully explain this reversal of position, thus depriving members of

21 the public with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on this significant change.

80.

22 Although the sudden change and brand-new analysis is not fully explained by the EIR,

23 it appears that this sudden change is based (at least in part) on the addition of mitigation measures
that are not adequately quantified.

24 81.

25 The EIR also fails to provide the analysis necessary to explain how the added GHG

26 mitigation measures resolve the impact under Significance Threshold 4.7-2, particularly given that

27 Topical Responses to other issues continue to indicate that the West Alton Plan conflicts with

28 applicable regional growth plans adopted, in part, to meet the State's greenhouse gas emission
reduction goals.

Gibson, Dunn &
Crutcher LLP. 20
VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

82. The reversal of position is particularly confusing in light of the fact that Topical

2 Response 3.1.8 of the Final EIR continues to state that, although the Draft EIR explains why "the

3 Project would not conflict with the RTP/SCS goals, strategies, and policies" which were adopted to

4 achieve the State's greenhouse gas emission reduction goals, the "[Orange County Projections] data
set did not reflect the Project." On this basis Topical Response 3.1.8 concludes that the planning
level impacts of the Project remain significant and unavoidable. In other words, the Final EIR's

7 conclusory reversal of position on greenhouse gas emissions is internally contradicted by other

8 sections of the Final EIR, and thus unsupported by substantial evidence.

9 83. The EIR's sudden reversal of its analysis requires further analysis, revisions to ensure

10 consistency, and recirculation so that the public and decision makers will not be deprived of a

11 meaningful opportunity to review and comment on the EIR.

12 The Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations Are Unsupported by

13 Substantial Evidence

14 84. CEQA requires that a project with significant adverse impacts be approved only if the

15 lead agency makes findings-supported by substantial evidence-that the project's benefits will

16 outweigh its adverse impacts and that there are not feasible mitigation measures or less damaging

17 alternatives available.

18 85. Because the EIR fails to accurately identify all of the Project's significant impacts, the

19 County never adopted findings to justify the Project's impacts in these areas. Thus, the Statement of

20 Overriding Considerations fails to meet CEQA requirements.

21 86. For all of the reasons set forth above, the Court should decertify the EIR and enjoin

22 the County and Lowe from taking any further action with respect to the Project, until a timely writ of

23 mandate is returned to this Court in compliance with CEQA, and the other applicable land use

24 regulations violated by Respondent's and Real Party's actions.

25 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

26 (Petition for Writ of Traditional Mandamus Under Code of Civil Procedure

27 Section 1085 or Alternatively Under Section 1094.5 Against Respondents)

28

Gibson, Dunn & 21
Crulcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 87. Heritage Fields incorporates paragraphs 1 through 86 of this Petition and Complaint as

2 though fully set forth herein.

3 88. Heritage Fields seeks a writ of traditional mandamus pursuant to Code of Civil

4 Procedure Section 1085, or alternatively an administrative mandamus pursuant to Section 1094.5.

5 The County's approval of the West Alton Plan is contrary to law and is a prejudicial abuse of

6 discretion.

7 89. Review is appropriate under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1085 or Section 1094.5

8 because the County has failed to act in the manner required by law, committed an abuse of discretion,

9 and thus the repeal of the West Alton Plan is specifically required by the law.

10 90. Heritage Fields has exhausted its administrative remedies through its participation in

11 the public processes preceding the approval.

12 91. Heritage Fields has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of

13 law to challenge the County's actions.

14 92. As a result, Heritage Fields is entitled to, and requests that this Court issue, a

15 peremptory writ of mandate compelling the County to repeal its approval of the West Alton Plan,

16 The City-and Only the City--Has the Authority to Approve a Private Development

17 Project Within Its Jurisdictional Boundaries.

18 93. The County asserts that the City's zoning and land use jurisdiction is inapplicable to

19 the Project due to California Government Code Sections 53090-53091, which the Draft EIR

20 incorrectly says "exempts [cities and counties] from zoning regulations when one entity owns

21 territory within the jurisdiction of another entity." However, the County fails to note that the

22 exemption from intergovernmental immunity cited by the County applies only to actions taken in a

23 governmental capacity; for actions which involve private or commercial projects, the jurisdiction in

24 which the property is located retains land use control. Thus, a state or local agency may not "extend

25 its immunity to private entrepreneurs who are involved in the local commercial market where their

26 competitors are subject to local regulation." (Board of Trustees v. City of Los Angeles (1975) 49
27 Cal.App.3d 45, 50.) Following Board of Trustees, the California Attorney General reconsidered an
28 earlier opinion (that it coincidentally had issued to the County of Orange) originally indicating :

Gibson, Dunn & 22
Crutchor LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES,
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

] relatively broad degree of immunity when one jurisdiction owned land within the boundaries of

2. another jurisdiction. Instead, the Attorney General opined that the proper view of Government Code

3 Sections 53090-91 is that these is statutes do not extend immunity to "private parties with respect to
their own private pursuits merely because the state" (or by parity of reasoning, the County) "happens

5 to be their landlord." 68 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 114, 121. Accordingly, the Project is subject to the land

6 use jurisdiction of the City-not the County-and the County's approval of the West Alton Plan was

7 taken without legal authority. (Xavier Becerra, Opinion of the Attorney General, No. 14-403 (Dec. 6,

8 2018)

9 94. Here, the Project is being proposed by Lowe pursuant to a disposition and

10 development agreement ("DDA") in which Lowe will be the "applicant" and "face" of the Project,

11 and is obligated to secure entitlements from relevant public agencies, minimize risks to the County,

12 and maximize potential for an extremely favorable financial return for the County.

13 95. Lowe's role as the "applicant" and "face" of the Project is further demonstrated by the

14 fact that the West Alton Plan appended to the Draft EIR was prepared for Lowe and the County (and,

15 indeed, has Lowe's logo on the front cover).

16 96. The County's Master Ground Lease with Lowe (the "Master Lease") on the

17 corresponding 100-Acre Parcel contemplates a term of 99 years, a term which connotes long-term

18 private use and ownership. It is contemplated that Lowe or some other private developer will pursue

19 a similar lease for the West Alton Project.

20 97. That Master Lease for the 100-Acre Parcel makes plain the fact that the County is not

21 a partner nor in a joint venture with Lowe. This West Alton parcel will be developed as a private a

22 development project and it is therefore subject to full City regulatory and land use authority, even

23 though the County is the landlord. Section 24 of the Master Lease makes clear that "it is expressly

24 understood and agreed that [the] County does not in any way or for any purpose become partner of

25 or a joint venturer with [Lowe] in the conduct of [Lowe's] business or otherwise." Indeed, Section

26 12.5 of the Master Lease would allow Lowe to make recommendations for the sale of all or a portion

27 of the property to third parties in furtherance of Lowe's obligation to undertake "the master planning,

28 entitlement, and infrastructure development for the Property, entitling and developing the Property

Gibson, Dunn & 23
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES,
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

for its highest, best and most economically viable use." It is anticipated that a similar master lease

2 will be approved by the County for the West Alton parcel.

3 98. In other words, and further supported by the above, the West Alton Plan is an approval

4 for an unequivocally private development project undertaken by Lowe or some other private

5 developer a on a property located within the incorporated City. The County, although it owns the

6 Property, has no immunity from City jurisdiction for private projects and therefore lacks the

7 jurisdiction to authorize this development, and the City has not approved the development.

8 Moreover, even if Lowe is not the ultimate developer of the Project, the same restrictions and

9 limitations that presently apply to Lowe would also apply to any private developer selected for the

10 Project.

11 99. To the extent the County were to possess jurisdiction to approve a private

12 development project within the City of Irvine (which it does not), the Project nonetheless fails to

13 comply with the County's General Plan.

14 100. It would be a complete violation of state planning laws to have a project that need not

15 conform to any General Plan. (E.g., East Sacramento Partnership for a Livable City v. City of

16 Sacramento (2016) S Cal.App.5th 281 [*local. land use and development decisions must be consistent

17 with the applicable general plan"]; Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of Supervisors, 52 Cal.3d 553,

18 570 (1990) [*the propriety of virtually any local decision affecting land use and development

19 depends upon consistency with the applicable general plan and its elements"'] (quoting Resource

20 Defense Fund v. County of Santa Cruz (1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 800, 806.))

21 101. Moreover, even accepting the County's demonstrably incorrect position that the

22 private West Alton Plan is a "public project," County development and infrastructure improvements

23 still must be consistent with adopted General Plans. (See, e.g., Friends of "B" Street v. City of

24 Hayward (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988, 998 [citing Government Code section 65302's requirement

25 that a local agency must comply with specified mandatory elements of an adopted general plan and

26 noting that the "Legislature did not limit this policy to decisions regarding proposed private
27 developments; it encompasses all decisions involving the future growth of the state, which

28

Gibson, Dunn 24
Crutcher LI VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

] necessarily includes decisions by a city to proceed with public works projects. All such decisions are

2 to be guided by an effective planning process that includes the local general plan"].)

3 102. Further, to the extent the County had planning jurisdiction, the County failed to submit

4 the West Alton Plan for a review by and recommendation from the County's Planning Commission,

5 even though this procedural requirement is imposed on both public and private projects. Section 7-9-

6 5(a) of the Orange County Code vests the County Planning Commission with the power to

7 "recommend to the officers of the County adoption of plans and regulations for the future growth,

8 development and beautification of the County in respect to public and private development."

9 (Emphasis added.)

10 103. The Board of Supervisors' adoption of the West Alton Plan without any noticed

11 hearing or review by the Planning Commission violates Section 65453 of the California Government

12 Code, which requires specific plans (the closest analogy to the West Alton Plan) to be subject to

13 review by the Planning Commission. No such review occurred for the Project.

14 104. Moreover, each of the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors (the

15 legislative body for the County) must hold at least one public hearing for which public notice is given

16 through publishing in a newspaper of general circulation not less than ten days prior to the hearing.

17 (See Sections 65353-54 of the Government Code.) On information and belief, the County held no

18 public hearings and provided no notice in the form required by the Government Code.

19 105. Similarly, even if the County were to claim that the West Alton Plan constitutes a

20 zoning enactment other than specific plan, Section 65853 et seq. requires the Planning Commission

21 to review other proposed land use ordinances at noticed public hearing. Thus, regardless of

22 whether the County characterizes the "West Alton Plan" as specific plan or other zoning enactment,

23 the County failed to proceed in the manner required by law.

24 106. Beyond these procedural defects, the West Alton Plan violates the foundational

25 requirement that all zoning enactments and development projects be compatible with the objectives,

26 policies, general land uses, and programs specified in a General Plan. (Cal. Gov. Code

27 § 65860(a)(ii).) As emphasized by the California Supreme Court, a zoning ordinance that is

28

Gibson, Dunn & 25
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

inconsistent with the general plan is void ab initio. (Lesher Communications, Inc. V. City of Walnut

2 Creek (1989) 262 Cal.Rptr. 337.)

3 107. For example, the West Alton Plan is inconsistent with the provisions of Measure W, a

4 voter initiative approved in 2002 that enacted County General Plan amendments that changed "the

5 allowed reuse of MCAS EI Toro to a non-aviation plan, consisting of educational, recreational, open

6 space cultural and other public uses" for so long as the area remained unincorporated.

7 108. The Measure W General Plan designation restricting the use to "educational,

8 recreational, open space cultural and other public uses" could not be modified by an action of the
a Board of Supervisors because Section 9 of Measure W provides that "[t]he Initiative may be amended

10 only by a vote of the people at a regular election held in accordance with the requirements of the

11 California Elections Code." And, as acknowledged in the Pre-Annexation Agreement, Measure W

12 applied open space designations to the Property. The one land use designation other than an "open
13 space" designation (which still does not allow the current Lowe proposal) was an "Education/Park
14 Compatible" designation, which called for long-term uses focused on educational facilities and
15 related research and development uses. That designation provided for 80% of the area to remain as

16 open space, maximum Floor to Area Ratio of 0.4, and a maximum of 45 employees per acre. The

17 one of these standards. West Alton Plan violates every

18 109. In short, the County's approval of the West Alton Plan violates Measure W by

19 enacting a land use plan wholly inconsistent with the General Plan provisions adopted by voters,

20 despite the requirement that the land use plan enacted by Measure W could only be amended by a

21 vote of the people for so long as the land remains "unincorporated."

22 110. The West Alton Plan is further inconsistent with the numeric, objective standards for

23 the provision of park land contained in the County's General Plan.

24 111. In addition to the fact that the West Alton Plan was never approved by the City, it

25 violates numerous City standards, including the existing City General Plan designation of the site.

26 112. The West Alton Plan thus followed none of the (even potentially) applicable rules:

27 it was not adopted by the City (which is the only jurisdiction with land use authority over this private development project); 28

26 Gibson, Ounn &
Crutcher LI.P . VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES,
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

it was not adopted following the required County procedures for review of private development projects;
2

3 it violates numerous substantive provisions of the County General Plan applicable to both public and private developments;

4
113. Thus, Heritage Fields is entitled to, and requests that this Court issue, a peremptory
writ of mandate compelling the County to repeal its approval of the West Alton Plan.

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
7
(Intentional Interference with Contractual Relations Against Defendant County) 8
114. Heritage Fields incorporates paragraphs 1 through 113 of this Complaint as though
fully set forth herein.
10
115. On or about July 12, 2005, Heritage Fields' direct predecessor in interest executed the 11 DA with the City and the Irvine Redevelopment Agency ("RDA"). The DA was recorded the same
12 day. On or about December 27, 2010, Heritage Fields executed the ARDA with the City and the Irvine
13 Redevelopment Agency ("RDA"). The ARDA was recorded on the same day. The ARDA is a valid
14 land enforceable contract that remains in effect between Heritage Fields, the City, and the Successor
15 Agency to the RDA.
16
116. The County is not and has never been a party to the DA or the ARDA; however, the
17 ARDA and the DA are existing encumbrances on the County property that were recorded against title
18 as part of the original Great Park transaction. Furthermore, the County is bound and subject to the
19 DA and the ARDA as a successor in interest to ownership of property transferred by both Heritage
20 Fields and the City pursuant to the DA and the ARDA. Section 19.1 of the DA states that "the 21 burdens and benefits hereof shall bind and inure to the benefit of each of the Parties hereto and all
22 successors in interest to the Parties hereto." Section 20.1 of the ARDA contains identical language.
23
117. Defendant County had knowledge of the DA and ARDA at the time that they were
24 entered into, because they were adopted as part of a public process and subsequently recorded. The
25 County also had knowledge of the DA and ARDA throughout the CEQA environmental review
26 process for the West Alton Plan, because the EIR for the Project references the ARDA throughout its
27 analysis. Exhibit L of the ARDA contains the Overlay Plan for the Heritage Fields development and
28 expressly provides that the West Alton Parcel would be developed with "agricultural" uses. Exhibits

Gibson, Dunn & 27
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES,
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 B and C of the DA also contain an Overlay Plan for the Heritage Fields development that expressly

2 provides that the County's property shall be developed for agricultural and open space uses. On

3 information and belief, Lowe also had similar knowledge as the County as to the ARDA's Exhibit L

4 and the DA's Exhibits B and C containing the Overlay Plan. Heritage Fields believes that Lowe

5 understood that the ARDA is an existing encumbrance on the County property and, despite this,

6 agreed to create the West Alton Plan, which is inconsistent with the use restrictions.

7 118. By approving the West Alton Plan and entering into contracts such as the Master

8 Ground Lease with Lowe, the County committed acts of governance intentionally designed to induce

9 a breach or disruption of the ARDA: Defendant County knew or was at minimum substantially

10 certain that such breach or disruption was a necessary consequence of its actions.
11 119. As a result of Defendant County's above-described actions, there has been a breach or

12 disruption of the ARDA. Section 3.9.4 of the ARDA requires the City to construct a park on the

13 Great Park Property substantially in compliance with the Great Park-Master Plan. The construction
14 of such a park requires a certain amount of allocated traffic capacity. With the County contracting

15 with Lowe to pursue the West Alton Plan-an unanticipated and unlawful dense private development

16 which uses substantially more traffic capacity than assumed under the ARDA-in the OC Great Park

17 area, the County proposes to utilize traffic capacity reserved for other ARDA uses, such as the City's

18 construction of the large-scale park pursuant to Section 3.9.4. The County has not made adequate
19 arrangements to ensure that the Project will in fact implement all necessary traffic mitigation, and
20 there will be reduced traffic capacity to accommodate future traffic from as yet to be implemented

21 uses in the OC Great Park. As result of the reduction in available traffic capacity, the City will be

22 unable to construct a park on the Great Park Property substantially in compliance with the Great Park

23 Master Plan, in breach of the ARDA.

24 120. But for Defendant County's actions regarding the West Alton Plan, the ARDA would

25 have been performed by the City and Heritage Fields.

26 121. Heritage Fields has been damaged due to Defendants County and Lowe's interference
27 with the ARDA, because (1) Heritage Fields' development has been and will be de-valued because the
28 City cannot build the Great Park as required by the ARDA, or meet its other obligations with respect to

Gibson, Dunn & 28
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES,
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

|Heritage Fields; (2) the County and Lowe's development now directly competes with Heritage Fields'
2 development; and (3) the County and Lowe's development will use up the traffic capacity that was
3 entitled to Heritage Fields in the ARDA, which will diminish the maximum possible density of
4 | Heritage Fields' development promised by the City in the ARDA.

122. Heritage Fields has developed and is developing properties in the OC Great Park area

6 in reliance on the City's promise to construct a park on the Great Park Property substantially in
7 compliance with the Great Park Master Plan. The Great Park has enhanced the value of Heritage
8 |Fields' properties and will enhance that value when completed as planned because the Great Park
Neighborhoods' proximity to the park increases the attractiveness of the development and raises the
10 value of the real estate. Heritage Fields has invested hundreds millions of dollars to obtain the property
11 subject to the ARDA and to entitle that property for specific uses articulated in the ARDA, and
12 previously approved by the City of Irvine. This includes completion of the OC Great Park by the City
13 and planned residential and commercial development. Due to the County's intentional interference
14 with Heritage Fields' contract with the City (namely the ARDA), the City is prevented from
15 constructing the Great Park in compliance with the Great Park Master Plan required by the ARDA, or
16 meet its other obligations with respect to Heritage Fields, thereby devaluing Heritage Fields'
17 development.

18 123. The County and Lowe's development will directly compete with Heritage Fields'
19 development because it will also develop residential units, rather than developing the parcel for
20 lagricultural uses. The two developments are close in proximity, and the presence of the County's and
21 |Lowe's development will de-value Heritage Fields' Great Park Neighborhoods by, among other
22 laspects, reducing the quality and breadth of the Great Park by decreasing its size and usage due to the
23 traffic that will be generated by the development of the West Alton Parcel.

24 124. The County's intentional interference also damages Heritage Fields by interfering
25 with its entitlements and by limiting the density of its development based on the planned infrastructure.
26 /Under Section 3.12 of the ARDA, the City granted Heritage Fields entitlements related to the traffic for
27 the area covered by the ARDA Overlay Plan, which includes the West Alton Parcel. As part of the

28 |grant of entitlements, Heritage Fields agreed to undertake certain traffic mitigation measures in line

Gibson, Dunn & 29
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

with the ARDA Overlay Plan. The entitlements granted in the ARDA establish the maximum amount
2 lof traffic capacity that will be permitted for the development, based on the capacity of the
3 development's infrastructure and the mitigation undertaken by Heritage Fields. The ARDA explicitly
4. contemplated that the West Alton Parcel would be used for agricultural and open space uses, and made
5 lassumptions about the traffic required for those uses. The County and Lowe's development will use
6 significantly more traffic than the traffic required to service an agricultural or open space use. The

7 |County and Lowe are therefore diverting traffic and infrastructure capacity (paid for by Heritage
8 Fields) that would otherwise service the Orange County Great Park (as well as Heritage Fields'
9 development of the Great Park Neighborhoods). By diverting this traffic capacity, the County and
10 Lowe are preventing the City from implementing its full vision for a robust scope of public park and
11 recreational improvements, as it has less traffic capacity available to it. This reduction in available
12 capacity will limit the types and ranges of potential Great Park uses, and Plaintiff will be precluded
13 from maximizing the full value of its investments. The County and Lowe were aware that damage will
14 be caused to Plaintiff as result of its actions, but chose to act in total disregard of Heritage Fields'
15 rights under the ARDA-thereby damaging Plaintiff in an amount to be established at trial.

16 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

17 (Breach of Contract Against Defendant County)

18 125. Heritage Fields incorporates paragraphs through 124 of this Complaint as though

19 fully set forth herein.

20 126. The Pre-Annexation Agreement between the County and the City is a valid and

21 enforçeable contract that is currently still in effect.

22 127. Heritage Fields is an intended third-party beneficiary under the Pre-Annexation
23 Agreement. The City and County's motivating purpose of entering into the Pre-Annexation Agreement
24 was to provide a benefit to the developer that would purchase the MCAS EI Toro Property to develop
25 it, the role that Heritage Fields now fills. The City and County contracted to provide a benefit to the
26 developer because both public entities would receive a financial benefit-in the form of tax a revenue-

27 from the developer's success in developing the property. The tax revenue generated by the future
28 development is tied directly to the value of that development; so the more attractive and valuable the

Gibson, Dunn & 30
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 future development by Heritage Fields, the more tax revenue will be paid to the County and the City.
2 Thus, the County and City were motivated to provide benefits to the future developer (including
3 enhancing the value of the developer's future projects) when they consummated the Pre-Annexation
4 Agreement. The future developer benefits from the land use restrictions in the Pre-Annexation
5 Agreement to the extent they limit the County's future uses of the West Alton site and prevent
6 competing uses and unplanned traffic demands. Section 2.2.6 of the Pre-Annexation provides that the
7 City and County would share the tax benefits from the developer's success. Section 2.2.6 states in its
8 entirety: "That Irvine and county will share property taxes from the annexed area in the same ratio as
9 is specified in that Master Property Tax Transfer Agreement 80-2035 dated October 28, 1980, to wit:
10 0.18123825104% to the City of Irvine, and 0.81876184896% to the County of Orange."

11 128. In order to maximize the tax benefits, the City and County entered into the Pre-
12 Annexation Agreement with the motivating purpose to provide certain benefits to the future developer,
13 including (1) a funding mechanism for infrastructure costs; (2) a limitation on the uses permitted on
14 property to be conveyed to the County; (3) an obligation to transfer the property expeditiously; and (4)

15 a requirement that a Development Agreement be established to govern the manner in which the parcels
16 would be conveyed by the future developer to the County.

17 129. Section 2.2.5 of the Pre-Annexation creates a "funding mechanism" to provide for
18 development and infrastructure costs, which benefits any developer or "Base user," as the term is used
19 in the Pre-Annexation Agreement. Section 2.2.5 states in its entirety: "The parties acknowledge that
20 the City seeks to create a funding mechanism whereby all Base users pay their fair share of the costs of

21 developing the necessary infrastructure and related improvements. The County agrees to participate in
22 such a funding mechanism and pay its fair share of costs that are limited to infrastructure improvements
23 directly related to servicing the properties County is to receive referenced in 2.2.3 above. Infrastructure
24 improvements shall refer to utilities, roadways, sewer lines, and other types of infrastructure needs that

25 lare necessary to service each County parcel, if any. The County will not be required to contribute,
26 through assessments or other funding or financing methods, to the development or maintenance costs
27 or expenses for any park or open space that will be developed and maintained on the Base under the
28 Irvine "Great Park Plan". Furthermore, to the extent they qualify, County shall have the option to pay

Gibson, Dunn & 31
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 any portion of its share of infrastructure costs and expenses with Road Funds or other non-General
2 Fund revenues." This provision was intended to benefit future "Base users," such as Heritage Fields,
3 so that Heritage Fields was not made to pay a disproportionate share of infrastructure costs or the
4 County's share of infrastructure costs.

5 130. Section 2.2.4 of the Pre-Annexation Agreement provides another benefit to the future

6 developer (Heritage Fields) by establishing use limitations for the property that is annexed to the is

7 County. Section 2.2.4 states in its entirety: "Irvine agrees that while the parcels of Base property that

8 County is to receive will be annexed to Irvine, that notwithstanding said fact, Irvine will zone
9 County's parcels and designate them in Irvine's General Plan, in accordance with County's direction.

10 In addition, County shall retain exclusive land use control over said parcels, and shall be entitled to

11 place any development upon said parcels that County shall determine to be desirable for County's

12 needs, as though said property remained unincorporated, without the obligation for payment to Irvine

13 of any permit fees or other mitigation/impact fees, other than in Section 2.2.5, including but not

14 limited to the following uses, all of which Irvine agrees with:
15 2.2.4.1 Animal shelter

16 2.2.4.2 Environmental Health facilities

17 2.2.4.3 Automotive/equipment repair facilities

18 2.2.4.4 Childcare facilities

19 2.2.4.5 Youth and Family Resource Center

20 2.2.4.6 Law Enforcement training facilities

21 2.2.4.7 Emergency Shelter

22 2.2.4.8 Transitional Shelter Care Facility

23 2.2.4.9 Children & Family Services Center

24 2.2.4.10 Business offices

25 2.2.4.11 Warehouses

26 2.2.4.12 Storage facilities

27 2.2.4.13 Vehicle parking and storage facilities

28 2.2.4.14 Heavy equipment maintenance and storage

Gibson, Dunn & 32
Crutcher L.LP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES,
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

2.2.4.15 Field operations and maintenance facility"

2 The "permitted uses and facilities" are defined in the Pre-Annexation Agreement by reference to "the

3 attached Exhibit titled MCAS El Toro: Proposed County Acquisitions," which identifies the uses

4 permitted on the West Alton Parcel as "County Facilities." (Section 2.2.3; Exhibit.) The Pre-

5 Annexation Agreement also describes these uses as the "County's regional facilities," whereby "[t]he

6 City will . . provide for land use designations that will allow for the intended uses indicated on the

7 attached Exhibit." (Section 2.2.3; Exhibit.) By limiting the uses permitted on the property annexed to

8 the County, the parties agreed to confer a benefit to the future developer (Heritage Fields) to remove
the possibility of any competition with the future development.

10 131. Section 4 of the Pre-Annexation confers a benefit to the future developer by providing
11 that the parties agree to transfer the property expeditiously. Section 4 states in its entirety: "County and
12 Irvine agree to cooperate and work together with the Navy to cause the expeditious transfer of the El
13 | Toro property."

14 132. Section 2.2.3.4 of the Pre-Annexation Agreement also intended to confer a benefit to
15 the future developer by requiring that a Development Agreement be established to govern the manner
16 in which the parcels would be conveyed by the future developer to the County (Section 2.2.3.4).
17 |Section 2.2.3.4 states in its entirety: "Be free of liens, leases, easements and restrictions inconsistent
18 with the County's proposed uses. The City shall include, in its Development Agreement, with the
19 purchaser(s) of the Base property a requirement that the purchaser(s) shall deliver to the County the
20 real property identified in Section 2.2.3 above, free and clear of any liens, financial encumbrances, and
21 non-utility easements."

22 133. The City's intent to benefit Heritage Fields by certain provisions of the Pre-

23 Annexation Agreement was later evidenced by the terms of the development agreement that the City

24 executed with Heritage Fields, the ARDA. Section 7.9 of the ARDA quotes Section 2.2.5 of the Pre-

25 Annexation Agreement (regarding the County's promise to pay its fair share of infrastructure costs,

26 for the benefit of future Base users) in full and the City covenants to request the County to honor this

27 obligation, and covenants to actively pursue enforcement of this provision, again for the benefit of

28 Heritage Fields as a Base user. In ARDA Section 7.9, the City also expressly acknowledged Heritage

Gibson, Dunn & 33
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Fields' existing ability to enforce its third-party rights under the Pre-Annexation Agreement:
N cn "[NJothing contained herein shall be deemed a waiver by Heritage Fields of any rights Heritage
Fields may have as against the County with respect to the County Agreement [Pre-Annexation

4 Agreement]." This intention was confirmed in a letter agreement from the City to Heritage Fields

5 executed December 27, 2019, which clarified the City's obligation to ensure compliance with the

6 Pre-Annexation Agreement and implementing agreements and that Heritage Fields had not waived

7 any of its rights thereunder.

8 134. On information and belief, the City has fully performed all conditions, covenants and

9 obligations required on its part to be performed in accordance with the terms of the Pre-Annexation

10 Agreement.

11 135. Under the Pre-Annexation Agreement, the County contractually committed to request

12 City zoning in accordance with government uses, such as the fifteen government uses enumerated in

13 Section 2.2.4 of the Pre-Annexation Agreement. In the alternative, pursuant to the requirement that

14 the land be treated as though it is "unincorporated," the County Board of Supervisors was obligated

15 to follow the land use plan enacted by Measure W, requiring its "unincorporated" land to be

16 maintained in accordance with the Open Space or Educational land use designations imposed on the

17 property by Measure W.

18 136. The County has breached the Pre-Annexation Agreement by:

19 failing to comply with this obligation to maintain uses in accordance with

20 Measure W;

588 approving a Development Plan that will introduce uses not authorized by the Pre-
Annexation Agreement;
refusing to recognize the City's land use jurisdiction and review process;
24 setting a up a mechanism by which Lowe may receive building permits without
25 paying its fair share of transportation improvements (thus increasing the burden

26 on Heritage Fields); and

27 creating impacts on the Orange County Great Park and other recreation facilities

28 not contemplated by the Pre-Annexation Agreement.

34 Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES,
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

P 137. Heritage Fields has been damaged by the County's breach of the Pre-Annexation
2 Agreement because (1) Heritage Fields' development has been and will be de-valued because the City
3 Icannot build the Great Park as required by the ARDA; (2) the County and Lowe's development, instead
4 of consisting of agricultural or institutional uses, now directly competes with Heritage Fields'
5 I development; and (3) the County is using up more than its allotted share of a finite amount of traffic
6 capacity for the area, which will diminish the maximum possible density of Heritage Fields'
7 |development.

8 138. Heritage Fields has developed and is developing properties in the Orange County
Great Park area in reliance on the City's promise to construct a park on the Great Park Property

10 . substantially in compliance with the Great Park Master Plan as required by the ARDA. The Great

11 Park has enhanced the value of Heritage Fields' properties already and will enhance that value when

12 completed as planned because the development's proximity to the Great Park increases the

13 attractiveness of the property and raises the value of the real estate. Heritage Fields has invested

14 hundreds of millions of dollars to obtain the West Alton Parcel subject to the ARDA and to entitle

15 that property for specific uses articulated in the ARDA and the DA, and previously approved by the

16 City of Irvine. This includes completion of the Orange County Great Park by the City and Heritage

17 Fields' planned residential and commercial development. As alleged, the City will not be able to

18 complete the Great Park in compliance with the Great Park Master Plan required by the ARDA

19 because the County has breached its obligation to develop the West Alton Parcel with agricultural or

20 open space uses, thereby devaluing Heritage Fields' development.
21 139. The County and Lowe's development will directly compete with Heritage Fields'
22 development beçause it will also contain residential units, rather than only agricultural or open space

23 uses. The two developments are close in proximity and the presence of the County's and Lowe's
24 development will de-value Heritage Fields' development.

25 140. The County's breach of the Pre-Annexation Agreement also damages Heritage Fields

26 by interfering with its entitlements and by limiting the density of its development based on the

27 planned infrastructure. Under Section 3.12 of the ARDA, the City granted Heritage Fields

28 entitlements related to the traffic for the area covered by the ARDA Overlay Plan, which includes the

35 Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES,
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

West Alton Parcel. As part of the grant of entitlements, Heritage Fields agreed to undertake certain

2 traffic mitigation measures in line with the ARDA Overlay Plan. The entitlements granted in the

3 ARDA establish the maximum number of traffic trips that will be permitted for the Great Park
Neighborhoods, based on the capacity of the development's infrastructure and the mitigation

5 undertaken by Heritage Fields. The ARDA explicitly contemplated that the West Alton Parcel would

6 be used for agricultural uses and made assumptions about the traffic required for those uses. The

7 County and Lowe's development will use significantly more traffic than that required to service an

8 agricultural use. The County and Lowe are therefore diverting traffic and infrastructure capacity

9 (paid for by Heritage Fields) that would otherwise service the Orange County Great Park. By

10 diverting this traffic, the County and Lowe are preventing the City from implementing its full vision

11 for a robust public park and recreational improvements, as it has less traffic capacity available to it.

12 This reduction in available capacity will limit the types and ranges of potential Orange County Great

13 Park uses, and Plaintiff will be precluded from maximizing the full value of its investments. The

14 County and Lowe were aware that damage would be caused to Plaintiff as result of their actions,

15 but chose to act in total disregard of Heritage Fields' rights under the ARDA and the DA-thereby

16 damaging Plaintiff in an amount to be established at trial.

17 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Declaratory Relief)

19 141. Heritage Fields incorporates paragraphs 1 through 140 of this Complaint as though
20 fully set forth herein.

21 142. Heritage Fields alleges and declares, and seeks a declaration of this Court às provided
22 below, as follows:

23 A. The Pre-Annexation Agreement, and specifically Sections 2.2.3 and 2.2.4

24 thereof, requires that the West Alton Parcel, and uses thereupon, are subject to, and remain subject to,

25 the City's General Plan, the City's Zoning Code, the California subdivision Law, and all other

26 procedures applicable to all public or private developments in the City, provided, however, permitted

27 uses (i.e. institutional uses only), as defined and set forth in Section 2.2.4 of the Pre-Annexation

28 Agreement, shall be allowed on, and constitute permitted uses of, the West Alton Parcel, and

Gibson, Dunn & 36
Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES. DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF•

2 therefore, Lowe cannot presently develop the West Alton Parcel for private residential uses as
contemplated in the West Alton Plan.

3 B.

4 In the alternative, the Pre-Annexation Agreement, and specifically Sections

5 2.2.3 and 2.2.4 thereof, requires that the West Alton Parcel, and uses thereupon, are subject to, and

6 remain subject to, the County's General Plan (including Measure W), the County's Zoning Code, the

7 California subdivision Law, and all other procedures applicable to all public or private developments

8 in the County, provided, however, permitted uses, as defined and set forth in Section 2.2.4 of the Pre-

9 Annexation Agreement (i.e. institutional uses only), shall be allowed on, and constitute permitted

10 uses of, the West Alton Parcel, and therefore, the County cannot approve a development of the West

11 Alton Parcel for private residential uses as currently contemplated in the West Alton Plan.

C.

12 The City has zoned the West Alton Parcel as Preservation and Exclusive

13 Agriculture, and as such, the County cannot lawfully approve the development of the Property for

14 private residential uses due to the zoning restriction. Section 2.2.4 of the Pre-Annexation Agreement,

15 which provides that the County may demand that the City change its zoning and planning restrictions,

16 constitutes an unlawful delegation and abdication of the City's police power, a violation of public

17 hearing, public participation, and transparency requirements. Section 2.2.4 of the Pre-Annexation

18 Agreement also is an unlawful attempt to bind future City Councils in relation to its exercise(s) of

19 police power and land use authority, should the County make such a demand. Should the City refuse

20 to comply with the County's demand (as the City has said it will do), then the City will fail to comply
with Section 2.2.4 of the Pre-Annexation Agreement. In that

21 case, Section 5 of the Pre-Annexation

22 Agreement, which provides that "failure of any party to comply with any provision of this [Pre-

23 Annexation] Agreement shall render the entire Agreement void[,]" must be enforced. In that case,

24 the Pre-Annexation Agreement is void, no future transfer of the remaining portions of the 100-Acre

25 Parcel is required, and the Property may only be developed consistent with the limitations that
presently exist.

26 D.

27 In the alternative, if, and to the extent the Pre-Annexation Agreement is not

28 unlawful, void, and unenforceable, the only permitted use of the West Alton Parcel shall be those

I permitted uses, as defined and set forth in Section 2.2.4 of the Pre-Annexation Agreement (i.e.

2 "public facilities" only).

3 E. The ARDA strictly prohibits the uses of the West Alton Parcel contemplated
by the West Alton Plan; and limits development to agricultural and open space uses. On December
27, 2010, after the Navy conveyed portions of the Property to Heritage Fields, the ARDA was
recorded against those properties transferred by the Navy. Prior to that, on July 12, 2005, the DA

7 was recorded against those properties transferred by the Navy, including the 100-Acre Parcel and the

8 West Alton Parcel. Thereafter, Heritage Fields conveyed the West Alton Parcel of the MCAS EI

9 Toro Property to the City subject to the covenants and conditions already recorded against the title,

10 including the land use limitations set forth in the ARDA and the DA. The City thereafter conveyed

11 that portion of the Property to the County subject to the covenants and conditions already recorded

12 against the title, including the limitations set forth in the ARDA and the DA. Therefore, the West

13 Alton Parcel cannot be used for any purposes other than the uses permitted by the ARDA and the

14 DA, which were recorded prior to the property transfers to the City, and then later to the County. The

15 County took title to those portions of the MCAS El Toro Property subject to the land use restrictions

16 specifically articulated in the ARDA.

17 143. Heritage Fields is informed and believes, and alleges thereon, that the County disputes

18 each and every one of the allegations and declarations set forth in paragraph 142 above, and that an

19 actual controversy exists as to each and every allegation and declaration therein.

20 134 In each of the items enumerated above, the County has violated its duty under the law,

21 abused its discretion, failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and decided to take the actions

22 objected to without the support of substantial evidence. Accordingly, certification of the EIR and

23 approval of the West Alton Plan must be set aside

24 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

25 THEREFORE, Heritage Fields prays for a declaration and entry of judgment against the County

26 and Real Party in Interest Lowe as follows:

27 A. For an alternative and peremptory writ of mandate, commanding the County to set aside

28 and vacate the certification of the EIR, Findings and Statement of Overriding

DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Considerations supporting the approval of the West Alton Plan; and to set aside and

2 vacate approval of the West Alton Plan based upon the EIR, Findings and Statement of

3 Overriding Considerations;

4 B. For an order precluding the County and Lowe from taking any action to construct

5 facilities or infrastructure, or undertaking site preparation until an adequate EIR is

6 prepared and timely resubmitted to this Court;

7 C. a For a declaration of the following:

8 1. That neither the County, nor Lowe, nor any other private party can develop the

9 West Alton Parcel for private residential uses as contemplated in the West

10 Alton Plan due to the County's failure to fulfill its statutory and contractual
11 obligations by approving a private land use plan within the jurisdictional

12 boundaries of the City;

13 2. That by approving the West Alton Plan the County has failed to comply with

14 the various City planning and zoning restrictions, applicable to all public or

15 private developments in the City;

16 3. That in the event the City's planning and zoning restrictions are found

17 inapplicable to the West Alton Parcel, that the West Alton Plan fails to comply

18 with the County's general plan and zoning codes (including Measure W), and

19 other applicable laws and measures;

20 4. That Lowe as a private developer, or any other private developer, is also.

21 subject to the same County and/or City restrictions as enumerated above;

22 5. That the only permitted use on the West Alton Parcel shall be the permitted

23 uses (i.e. institutional uses), as defined and set forth in Section 2.2.4 of the Pre-

24 Annexation Agreement; or in the alternative, that the Pre-Annexation

25 Agreement is unlawful, void, and unenforceable as an abdication of the City's

26 police power; and

Crutcher LLP VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR DAMAGES, DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

6. That the ARDA is an existing encumbrance on title to the West Alton Parcel

2 such that neither the County, Lowe nor any other private party can develop the

3 Property for private residential uses as contemplated in the West Alton Plan.

4 D. For damages, including but not limited to those for breach of contract, lost profits,
expenses, diminution in value of property and business, and prospective profits;

6 E. For punitive damages for inflicting an intentional tort against the Plaintiff, with the intent

7 to harm Plaintiff as more specifically pled above;

8 F. For injunctive relief precluding County or Lowe from taking any action to advance the

9 Project;

10 G. For specific performance under the terms of the contract;
11 H. For costs of the suit;

12 I, For reasonable attorney's fees; and

13 J. For such other relief as the Court deems just and proper.
