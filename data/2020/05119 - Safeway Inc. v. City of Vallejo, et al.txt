3 known as the "Fairview at Northgate" project located at a vacant site at southeast corner of

4 Admiral Callaghan Lane and Turner Parkway (APN: 0081-490-010), consisting of
approximately 51.3 acres and including the following specific land use approvals: Planned

6 Development (PD) 17-0007, Tentative Map (TM) 17-0002 Major Use Permit (UP) 18-0007,

7 Zoning Map Amendment (ZMA) 17-0001 collectively the "Land Use Approvals" or "Project"),

8 (b) revoke the Planning Commission recommendation as illegal under the Ralph M. Brown Act

9 ("Brown Act")(c) vacate the City Council decision for being rendered without first receiving a
legal planning commission recommendation, and (d) vacate the City Council hearing for
10 unfairness, a lack of due process and depriving Petitioner of a non-discriminatory right to
11

12 instruct its public officials. The City's actions violate State and local land use and environmental

13 laws, the Brown Act, the Public Records Act, the Appearance to Conduct a Fair Hearing,
Petitioner's right to instruct government in a non-discriminatory manner, and amounts to a
14 prejudicial abuse of discretion. A writ of mandate and preliminary and permanent injunctions
15 are necessary to remedy the City's failure to adequately address the Project's environmental
16 impacts; to ensure that the City complies with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws, and to
17

18 ensure proper review and disclosure, mitigation of the potential environmental impacts resulting

19 from the approval and development of the Project pursuant to the California Environmental

20 Quality Act ("CEQA") and conduct public hearing in conformity with Constitutional statutory
requirements. By this verified Petition, Petitioner presents:

21 PARTIES

22 1.

23 Petitioner is, and at all times mentioned herein was, a Delaware corporation.

24 Petitioner operates three Safeway grocery stores and one gas station in the city of Vallejo. More

25 specifically, Petitioner leases and operates Store #989 at 774 Admiral Callahan Lane in the

26 Redwood Plaza Shopping Center (Redwood Plaza), owns and operates store and gas station #968

27 at 709 Lincoln Road W. and leases and operates store #1631 at 122 Robles Drive. Store #989 is

1 respectively), BCTGM Local 24 (Bakery) and Teamsters Local 439 (Distribution Center). The
2 three Safeway locations in Vallejo employ approximately 450 employees, of whom an estimated

3 sixty-five percent are Vallejo residents. Petitioner is vitally and beneficially interested in the land

4 use decisions made by the City. Petitioner and Petitioner's representative, together with other

5 members of the public and various public agencies, participated in the public hearing process and

6 public comment process regarding the Land Use Approvals and the associated EIR by submitting

7 written comments on the EIR, submitting written comments and appearing at the Vallejo

8 Planning Commission ("Planning Commission") hearing, and submitting written comments and

Q appearing at the Vallejo City Council ("City Council") hearing. Petitioner also timely submitted
10 written objections to the Planning Commission and City's violation of the Brown Act
11 requirements in connection with conducting its Planning Commission hearing. Petitioner also
12 filed a California Public Record Act ("CPRA") request to obtain public documents concerning
13 the processing and analysis of the Project and asking for this information to be disclosed before

14 the City Council acted on the Project.

15 2. The City is, and all times mentioned herein was, a charter law city existing under
16 the laws of the State of California. The City has a duty under state law to comply with state law
17 requirements, including CEQA, State Planning and Zoning Law, the CPRA and the Brown Act
18 when considering land use requests.

19 3. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that Real Party in Interest,
20 Vallejo Fairview Developers, LLC ("Developer"), is a Delaware limited liability corporation

21 located in Upland, California and authorized to do business in California.

22 4. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities, whether individual,

23 corporate, or otherwise, of those Respondents and Real Parties in Interest sued herein as Does I

25 and Real Parties in Interest are in some manner responsible for the adoption of, imposition of, of
26 administration of those laws, ordinances, regulations of which Petitioner complains herein.

27 Petitioner will amend this Petition to set forth the true names and capacities of the fictitiously

28 named Respondents and Real Parties in Interest when such information has been ascertained.

4 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

5 6. Developer submitted applications to the City for the Land Use Approvals in or

6 about 2017.

7 7. The Land Use Approvals propose (i) the closure of an operating, approximately

8 125,437 square foot Costco store ("Existing Costco") and 16 pump Costco gas station ("Existing

9 Costco Gas") located at 198 Plaza Drive in the city of Vallejo (the "Existing Costco Site"), and

10 (ii) the ground up development of an approximately 51.3-acre vacant site (APN: 0081-490-010)

11 at the southeast corner of Admiral Callaghan Lane and Turner Parkway, to include a new,

12 approximately 152,138 square foot Costco store, 30 pump Costco gas station, 23,000 square feet
13 of additional non-Costco retail space including drive-thru facilities, 178 single family homes, and

14 associated parking and landscaping. The Project Site is situated on a frontage road to Interstate

15 80, Admiral Callaghan Lane, and is just under one mile west of the Existing Costco Site.

16 8. On or about June 19, 2019 Defendant determined the Project applications were

17 complete for processing.

18 9. On or about January 15, 2020 Real Party in Interest submitted an amendment to

19 the Project applications. Two days later the City released a Draft Environmental Impact Report
20| (sometimes referred to as "DEIR") and commenced a 45-day public comment period ending on

21 March 2, 2020.

22 10. On or about April 10, 2020 the City released a final EIR (sometimes referred to as

23 "FEIR" or "Final EIR", being the same as the EIR), including responses to public comments
24 submitted on the DEIR.

25 11. On or about April 20, 2020 the Planning Commission conducted a public hearing

26 about the Final EIR and the Project ("PC Hearing"). The PC Hearing was conducted remotely

27 and members of the public were prohibited from attending the meeting in person. Members of

28 the public were limited to observing and participating in the PC Hearing through a Zoom internet

P vehicle. Petitioner and Petitioner's counsel submitted letters to the Planning Commission

2 expressing detailed opposition to the EIR and Project.

3 A. In order to participate in the PC Hearing, a citizen was required to register

4 as a participant at the City's bsite. The website required certain personal information,

5 including the citizen's name, address, age, gender, and email address. Without completing this

6 form and agreeing to an 8 page Terms of Service, a citizen could not access the live video of the
7 PC Hearing and could not address the Planning Commission. After completing the registration

8 the City website added the personal information of a citizen registered to observe the

9 proceedings to a map depicting a the neighborhood where each registrant lived and a bar graph
10 depicting the demographics of the registrants, including how many times each person had

11 participated in prior hearings. The map and bar graph were visible to the public. Each registrant

12 also received a message asking for additional personal information for "marketing purposes".

13 B. The Vallejo Planning Commission agenda was not posted on the primary

14 internet website homepage of the City nor was it posted a as a direct link to the integrated agenda
15 management platform on the primary website homepage. It was posted in a contextual menu

16 within the City website.

17 C. The Planning Commission discriminated between members of the public.

18 Some public members were permitted to participate by telephonic video while other members of

19 the public were allowed to only participate electronically. Representatives of Real Party in

20 Interest, as well as tenant Costco, were permitted to participate by telephonic video, spoke

21 directly to the Planning Commission members, answered questions posed by Planning

22 Commissioners and were afforded over thirty minutes to present their case. Petitioner, on the
23 other hand, was strictly limited to submitting a three-minute written statement read aloud to the

24 Planning Commissioners by its clerk in a monotone voice and had no opportunity to dialogue
25 with Planning Commissioners.

26 D. The Vallejo Community Development Department prepared supplemental
27 documents in response to some but not all of the written communications submitted to the

28 Planning Commission. However, these documents were buried in the City website, no

- notification was afforded to the public about the existence of these documents and it was

2 virtually impossible to locate these documents before the PC Hearing.
E. As reported by the New York Times and other news agencies, the PC

4 Hearing was chaotic. Various Planning Commissioners had repeated technical difficulties in
participating in the meeting, repeatedly left their seats for undisclosed reasons leaving a vacant

6 Zoom square, appeared to be drinking alcohol, introduced household pets by name, and threw at

7 least one cat against a hard object. Thereafter, one Planning Commissioner, Chris Platzer,

8 resigned from the Planning Commission citing his conduct at the PC Hearing as reported in the

9 New York Times and other news agencies.

10 12. At the conclusion of the hearing the PC Hearing recommended to the City

11 Council that it certify the EIR and approve the Project.

12 13. On or about May 5, 2020, Petitioner's counsel, pursuant to the CPRA, submitted

13 written correspondence to the City requesting a copy of all public documents related to the EIR,
14 land use applications for the Land Use Approvals, or otherwise relating to the Project. The

15 purpose of the request was to assure Petitioner it had all relevant information and data the City
16 was relying on in evaluating the EIR and Project. Thereafter the City sent information in large

17 batches, disclosing documents in a manner that did not follow logic or sequential order. On or

18 about May 15, 2020, the City announced it would follow a new disclosure method: documents

19 would be periodically released to Petitioner in batches between June 12, 2020 and December 18,

20 2020. These dates fell after the City Council hearing on the Project which was conducted on

21 June 9, 2020 ("Council Hearing").

22 14. On or about May 15, 2020, Petitioner's counsel filed a demand letter with the City

23 to cure or correct violations of the Brown Act committed at the PC Hearing.

24 15. On or about May 18, 2020 Petitioner's counsel filed a demand letter with the City

25 to produce documents responsive to Petitioner's CPRA.

26 16. On or about June 9, 2020, Petitioner and Petitioner's counsel submitted written
27 correspondence to the Vallejo City Council opposing certification of the EIR and approval of the
28 Project. The letters stated:

A. For at least nine separate reasons the EIR's analysis of the Urban Decay

2 Impact was legally insufficient.

3 B. The EIR's analysis of traffic impacts was legally insufficient.

4 C. The EIR's analysis of energy impacts was legally insufficient.

D. Due to Brown Act violations committed during the Planning Commission

6 process the City Council did not receive a lawful recommendation from the Planning
7 Commission and therefore lacked authority to act on the EIR and/or Project.

8 B. For multiple reasons the Council Hearing was conducted in an unfair

9 manner, violated Due Process and otherwise deprived Petitioner of its Constitutional right to
10 instruct its elected representatives.

11 17. On or about June 9, 2020, the City Council after a remotely conducted public
12 hearing denied the existence of a Brown Act violation, certified the EIR and approved the

13 Project. Petitioner and Petitioner's representative participated in the Council Hearing by

14 providing written correspondence to the City Council. Petitioner's counsel's three-minute

15 statement to the City Council was read at the Council Hearing by the City Clerk; however,

16 without explanation and despite Petitioner's notification to City staff during the hearing of the

17 omission, Petitioner's three-minute statement to the City Council was omitted from the public

18 hearing. In contrast, and similar to as occurred at the PC Hearing, the Project's representatives

19 were provided unlimited time through video conferencing to present its case to the City Council.

20 18. No member of the City Council asked a question or uttered a comment about the

21 letters and statements submitted by Petitioner or Petitioner's counsel, or otherwise acknowledged

22 the submission of these letters and statements.

23 19. On or about June 16, 2020, a Notice of Determination was posted by the County

24 Clerk. However, on or about May 22, 2020, the Judicial Council of California amended

25 emergency rule 9 to extend statutes of limitations for matters such as this current dispute until

26 September 2, 2020. The parties through a tolling agreement subsequently extended the period of

27 time to file this action to November 2, 2.020.

1 20. The Land Use Approvals were discretionary in nature, requiring mandatory

2 substantive findings. The decision-makers were required to exercise judgment and deliberation

3 in determining whether and how to approve the Project.

4 21. The City Council was presented with substantial evidence that the Project would

5 result in significant environmental effects that had not been adequately studied or mitigated in

6 the EIR.

22. Petitioner has exhausted all administrative remedies concerning the Project.

8 Petitioner's representatives and other members of the public objected orally and in writing at the

9 PC Hearing and Council Hearing, and presented evidence that the Project has the potential to

10 cause significant environmental impacts, and that the environmental review considered for the

11 Project does not satisfy the minimum requirements of CEQA.

12 23. Petitioner has a direct and beneficial interest in the City's full compliance with

13 CEQA, State Planning and Zoning Law, the Brown Act, the CPRA and all other applicable laws
14 when approving the Project.

15 24. The City has a mandatory and public duty to comply with CEQA, State Planning

16 and Zoning Law, the Brown Act, the CPRA and all other applicable laws when approving the
17 || Project.

18 25. Petitioner's claim is ripe for review.

19 26. Petitioner will be directly and substantially affected by the adverse environmental
20  impacts that may result from the Project.

21 27. Petitioner has standing to bring this action and seek to compel a public duty in the
22 form of Respondent complying with State and local land use and environmental laws.

23 28. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Pub. Res. Code $21167.5 by
24 mailing written notice of this action to the City.

25 29. Petitioner has complied with Pub. Res. Code §21167.7 and Code of Civ. Proc.

26 §388 by notifying the Attorney General of California of the commencement of this action.
27 30. Petitioner has a right to enforce the City's mandatory duties under State and local

4 A clear and significant benefit will be conferred upon the general public and

5 Petitioner by Respondent fully satisfying the requirements of State and local law prior to

6 certifying the EIR and approving the Land Use Approvals. A clear and significant benefit will

7 be independently conferred upon the general public by the Respondent fully satisfying the

8 requirements of CEQA, State Planning and Zoning Law, the. Brown Act, the CPRA, and

9 applicable City zoning ordinances and planning documents. In instituting this action, Petitioner

10 seeks to procure enforcement of a mandatory duty. The public, of which Petitioner is a member

11 is vitally and beneficially interested in assuring the mandate of law is fully satisfied and fulfilled.

12 Granting the relief requested by Petitioner would confer a significant benefit on a large class of
persons, in that fundamental rules of law would be affected.

13 33.

14 By the authority of Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public

15 Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5, and 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a Writ

16 of Mandate and other appropriate equitable and injunctive relief to set aside the City's approval
of the Project and certification of the EIR.

17 34.

18 Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of action alleged in this Petition

19 arose in Solano County where both the Project Site and the City that approved the Project are

located.

22 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Violation of CEQA: The City Committed a Prejudicial Abuse of Discretion by Failing to

24 35. Evaluate and Mitigate Urban Decay Impacts)

25 Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained
in Paragraphs 1 through 34, above.

26 36.

27 Urban decay is an indirect physical change caused by a direct economic effect and

28 is a recognized environmental effect to be considered in an EIR. Economic effects create a chain a

HEAUM CRABTRE SUNTAG of events leading to the physical environmental effect known as urban decay.

AITORMEYS 9
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (Code of Civ.Proc. Sections 1085 and 1094.5; California Environmental Quality Act); violation of Ralph M. Brown Act AND Public Resources Codes sections 21168, 21168.5 and 21168,9

37. City did not adequately evaluate or mitigate the Project's potential to cause urban

2 decay in the city of Vallejo and surrounding communities.

3 38. The Final EIR identified an urban decay report ("Urban Decay Report")
4 commissioned by the City to support a conclusion that the urban decay environmental impact is

5 less than significant. Yet this Urban Decay Report fails to provide sufficient information and

6 data to support this conclusion and, indeed, omits relevant information and data.

7 39. As a result, the Urban Decay Report fails to analyze the potential urban decay

8 impact in a manner required by law resulting in omitting relevant data and information. For

9 instance:

10 A. The City's Urban Decay Report (also known as the Taussig Report)

11 assumes the Project's retail market element, and more specifically the Project Costco, affects a

12 seven mile retail market area and concludes sufficient retail demand exists within this seven mile

13 market area to accommodate existing retail plus the Project Costco. However, the threatened

14 existing retail operations have a much smaller market area; therefore, the seven mile Project

15 Costco market area dilutes the intensity of the impact by adding retail demand outside the

16 threatened retail users' market area and irrelevant to their economic success. Petitioner

17 commissioned professional review of the Taussig Report by Gran Goehring and thereafter

18 submitted to the City the Goehring Report which concluded the Urban Decay Report:
19 "oversimplifies the problem and consequently does not accurately address whether the Fairview

20 Project may induce a chain of events leading to urban decay." Thus, a seven mile market area

21 may indicate whether the Project Costco will be successful but impedes disclosing whether
22 nearby existing retailers will fail as a result of the Project Costco's location, causing a chain of

23 events leading to an urban decay environmental effect. This is a failure to proceed in a manner
24 required by law.

25 B. The Urban Decay Report overstated the amount of "Total Residential

26 Spending" (a term used in the Urban Decay Report) in the market area by omitting e-commerce

27 sales. The Urban Decay Report does not calculate the amount of e-commerce transactions

28 within the market area and therefore did not deduct the amount of e-commerce sales from
IRUM CRABTIRE SUNTAG ATTORNEYE 10 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE (Code of Civ.Proc. Sections 1085 and 1094.5; California Environmental Quality Act); violation of Ralph M. Brown Act AND Public Resources Codes sections 21168, 21168.5 and 21168.9

P estimated total retail sales demand within the market area. Yet e-commerce sales represent

2 eleven percent of retail sales nationally and are probably higher in the San Francisco Bay area.

3 By not deducting e-commerce sales from the "Total Residential Spending", the amount of retail

4 demand in the market area is overstated when evaluating the first link in the chain of events

5 leading to urban decay. This is a failure to proceed in a manner required by law.

6 C. The Urban Decay Report underestimated the Project's retail demand.

7 Responding to comments, the City asserts the Project Costco should be analyzed as an expansion
of the existing 125,437 square foot Costco store and 16 pump gas station rather than the
construction and operation of a new 152,138 square foot Costco store and 30 pump gas station at
a different site. The Urban Decay Report follows that the Project creates only 26,701 square feet 10

11 of additional display area of which one-half would be used for groceries. This applies an
12 unlawful baseline and results in underestimating the Project's retail demand. CEQA requires an
13 evaluation of environmental impacts to consider physical conditions on the land before and after
14 project approval. Here the physical conditions of the land are vacant real property and the

15 physical conditions after Project approval are a new Costco warehouse Costco gas station, retail
16 shops and single family homes. By evaluating only the added display area at the Project Costco

17 which exceeds the retail area found in an existing Costco located elsewhere, the Urban Decay
18 Report underestimates Project retail demand. This is a failure to proceed in a manner required
19 by law.

20 D. The Urban Decay Report presented a truncated market area that was

21 inconsistent with the proposed ten-mile deed restriction that would be placed on the Existing
22 Costco Site after the Project Costco opened. By using the smaller seven-mile area, particularly

23 without any express or implied justification for a smaller area, the Urban Decay Report omitted
24 existing retail users located in the area between the seven- and ten-mile radius. Examples of
25 existing retailers located between seven- and ten-miles from the Project who compete for retail

26 customers within the seven-mile market area, include among others, Whole Foods, Trader Joe's,
27 a Costco located in Fairfield and a proposed Costco in Napa. The ten-mile area proposed for the
28 Existing Costco deed restriction is consistent with academic research concluding that a Costco

T1 store generally serves a population of about 300,000 people, and this same area should have been

2 applied to determine the impacts of the Project Costco. If the market area in the Urban Decay

3 Report was consistent with the deed restriction, then the Fairfield Costco would be included in

4 the same market as the Project Costco, with two Costco stores drawing on retail dollars from the

5 approximately 200,000 people living within this ten-mile market area. An artificially shrunken

6 market area of seven-miles omits relevant outlets for retail dollars and overstates the amount of

7 retail dollars for existing retailers and the Project Costco. This is a failure to proceed in a

8 manner required by law.

9 E. The Urban Decay Report underestimated the existing demand for retail
10 dollars within the market area by omitting the existing Fairfield Costco. Each Costco generally
11 serves approximately 300,000 people and the Fairfield and Project Costco stores are within a
12 common ten mile area that includes approximately 200,000 people. Alternatively, if the Fairfield
13 Costco is assigned a seven mile area and this area is applied in relationship to the Project

14 Costco's seven mile area, then five of the Fairfield Costco's seven mile area overlaps with the
15 Project Costco's seven mile area. Failing to proceed in a manner required by law distorts the
16 number of retail outlets competing for the limited demand for retail goods.

17 F. The Urban Decay Report did not comply with the Vallejo Municipal
18 Code. Vallejo Municipal Code section 16.76.040 requires a survey and analysis of existing and
19 proposed stores, calculating their current average retail sales for the cities of Vallejo, Benicia and

20 American Canyon. Specifically, the Municipal Code requires the survey to incorporate and

21 comprehensively study eight elements:

22 1. a survey of existing stores;

23 2. a survey of existing, proposed and/or pending superstores;
24 3. a survey of the number of persons employed at each existing store;

25 4. an analysis of the short and long term potential effects to existing retail as
26 specified by subsection 1 and 2;

27 5. an analysis of short and long term potential effects on retail, food and

28 beverage sales;

violation of Ralph M. Brown Act AND Public Resources Codes sections 21168, 21168.5 and 21168.9

1 6. a fiscal impact analysis;

2 7. an analysis of the proposed superstore's long and short term net effect on

3 the ability of consumers to obtain a variety of food, beverage and other retail products;

4 8. an analysis of the savings to consumers.
The City's response to comments about the DEIR confirms the Urban Decay Report did

6 not comply with the mandatory elements of the Municipal Code requirements. The response

7 stated the Urban Decay Report only investigated whether there were new proposed or pending

8 superstores in American Canyon or Benicia. Petitioner offered substantial evidence that

9 American Canyon suffers from urban decay in the form of the October 24, 2004 memorandum

10 from Dr. Phillip King to Brett Jolley, as well as Vallejo in the form of written comments and

11 testimony.

12 G. The Urban Decay Report omitted the potential for urban decay caused by
13 a vacancy at the Existing Costco store. An EIR must analyze the potential for urban decay when
14 an existing building becomes vacant:

15 (T)he retail analysis fails to meaningfully address the question whether the
16 building on White Lane that currently houses a Wal-Mart store will experience a long-term vacancy when this store is closed. No facts are offered in support
17 of the retail analysis's conclusion that the building can be leased to another tenant. "Can" is not equivalent to "will" and the difference in the two
18 words is crucial when assessing whether the store closure will result in an
19 adverse environmental impact. The retail analysis characterizes vacancies as
normal parts of a dynamic and evolving retail environment without considering
20 whether those vacancies are clustered in one area or are likely to be long term.

PETITION FOR. WRIT OF MANDATE (Code of Civ.Proc. Sections 1085 and 1094.5; California Environmental Quality Act); violation of Ralph M. Brown Act AND Public Resources Codes sections 21168, 21168.5 and 21168.9

Petitioner submitted a report from Mr. Larry Mansbach. Mr. Mansbach concluded a
2 l confluence of identified factors will result in the vacated Existing Costco premises remaining
closed for an extended period of time. Mr. Mansbach explained the CC&Rs recorded against the

4 real property severely limit the potential for a single user to occupy the premises and the

5 configuration of the building makes it practically impossible to divide the space for multiple

6 tenants. Dispensing with an analysis of the potential that the vacant existing building (i.e. the

7 Existing Costco) may be the first chain in events leading to urban decay is a failure to proceed in

8 a manner required by law.

9 H. The Urban Decay Report disguised obvious stress factors to certain

10 segments of the retail market. The Urban Decay Report collapsed all retail supply and demand,
11 created a general and monolithic category called "retail", and failed to distinguish between

12 different types of retail such as a carton of eggs from a grocery store versus chicken fertilizer
13 from a home improvement store. The Goehring Report submitted by Petitioner pointed out:

14 "[c]rucially, the two categories in which the supply exceeds demand are in food and automotive

15 retail. These are both categories in which the Fairview Project will increase supply….the

16 Fairview Project will be increasing supply in two categories-food and automotive retailin
17 which consumers are currently not underserved by their estimates." The neighboring Redwood
18 Plaza, where Safeway store #989 is located, is dominated by food and automobile retail. It is a

19 failure to proceed in a manner required by law to treat all retail goods and retail demand as is the
20 same when the Project Costco specifically stresses specific retailers such as grocery stores and

21 automotive retail. This flawed approach results in the failure to disclose relevant information and.

22 data about the significance of the urban decay impact.

23 40. The EIR's conclusion that the Project will not cause urban decay is not supported

24 by substantial evidence in the record of proceedings. Consequently, the City's decision to

25 approve the Project is not supported by substantial evidence and the City prejudicially abused its

26 discretion and acted in excess of its jurisdiction by approving the Project without first complying
27 with CEQA in adequately addressing the individual and cumulative urban decay impacts from
28 the Project.

1 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of CEQA: Failure to Adequately Evaluate and Mitigate Traffic Impacts)

3 41. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained

4 in Paragraphs 1 through 40, above.

5 42. The EIR's evaluation of traffic impacts and proposed mitigation measures are

6 legally insufficient. More specifically:

7 A. The traffic study performed by the City in connection with the Project

8 ("Traffic Study") and the Urban Decay Report are inherently inconsistent. The Urban Decay

9 Report assumes the Project Costco will draw consumers from a seven mile area. However, the

10 Traffic Study does not rely on a seven mile area to conduct a traffic analysis. Instead potential
11 traffic impacts are subject to a more restricted geographic area. This constricted geographic area
12 for studying traffic omits intersections in the Urban Decay Report's secondary area that may be
13 impacted by the Project Costco traffic. Therefore, either the seven mile market area is the

14 correct geographic measurement in which case traffic impacts were omitted from the secondary
15 market area or the Traffic Study's smaller geographic area is correct in which case there is less
16 surplus retail demand and the greater potential for urban decay from the Project Costco than
17 estimated by the Urban Decay Report.

18 B. Traffic Study treated the Project as an expansion of the Existing Costco
19 and Existing Costco Gas rather than a new Costco warehouse and new Costco gas station, and

20 therefore underestimated the size of the Project by using only the delta between the Existing

21 Costco Site and Project. By not utilizing the full square footage of the Project Costco and
22 Project Costco Gas, the Traffic Study underprojected traffic impacts to adjoining streets, most

23 notably to Redwood Plaza and Store #989 and therefore underprojected the Project's need to

24 contribute to traffic improvements.

25 C. The EIR wrongly relies on future CalTrans improvements at Redwood

26 Parkway and I-80 interchange, as partial mitigation of the significance of the Project's traffic
27 impact. An EIR cannot assume that major road and interstate improvements, with no method of
28 financing or known timing for design and construction, will occur sometime in the future and

P therefore qualify as mitigation for the project's significant traffic impacts. To constitute

2 mitigation, it must be "part of a reasonable plan of actual mitigation that the relevant agency

3 commits itself to implement." Anderson First Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130

4 Cal.App.4th 1173, 1188. Akin to the situation in Anderson First Coalition, the City erroneously

5 relies upon future construction projects (i.e. CalTrans improvements at Redwood Parkway and I-

6 80 interchange) that are not part of a reasonable mitigation plan that the City has committed itself

7 to implement. Without satisfying these elements of enforceable mitigation, the City's reliance

8 a on this step as a mitigation measure is unlawful.

D. Traffic Study used traffic assumptions from an earlier In N Out Burger
10 ("Burger") traffic study rather than taking actual traffic counts after Burger opened in Redwood
11 Plaza in January 2019. By applying an unlawful baseline of the Project, the Traffic Study did

12 not lawfully evaluate the traffic impact and provide relevant data and information about the

13 significance of the traffic impact.

14 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Violation of CEQA: Failure to Adequately Evaluate and Mitigate Energy Impacts)
16 43. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained
17 in Paragraphs 1 through 42, above.

18 44. CEQA Guidelines Appendix F states that CEQA "requires that EIRs include a
19  discussion of the potential energy impacts of proposed projects." Appendix F contains detailed
20 specific items that must be included in a legally sufficient analysis of energy impacts by an
21  environmental impact report.

22 45. The City received substantial evidence in the form of written comments and
23 testimony that the EIR failed to perform the requisite analysis of the Project's potential energy
24  impacts.

25 46. The EIR does not disclose the extent to which the Project will create energy
26 impacts. The environmental analysis in this section is patterned after the Initial Study Checklist
27 recommended by the CEQA Guidelines. The issues presented in the Initial Study Checklist have

1  been utilized as thresholds of significance in this section. According to the EIR, a project may
a 2 create a significant environmental impact if it causes one or more of the following to occur:

3 Result in potentially significant environmental impact due to wasteful,

4 inefficient, or unnecessary consumption of energy resources, during project construction or operation.
5 Conflict with or obstruct State or local plan for renewable energy or 6 energy efficiency.

7 DEIR. at 4.11-9. While the emphasis may be to avoid inefficient, wasteful or unnecessary energy
8 consumption, the threshold for determining an energy impact to be significant is substantially
broader and cannot be dispensed with. Thus this narrow definition of a threshold of significance
10 operates to truncate a full analysis of energy impacts.
11 47. The DEIR conceded the legal adequacy of its energy section should be measured
12 against Appendix F of the CEQA Guidelines. At page 4.11-1 the DEIR revealed: "According to
13 State CEQA Guidelines Section 15126.2(b), Section 15126.4 (a)(1)(C), and Appendix F, the goal
14 of conserving energy implies the wise and efficient use of energy including decreasing reliance
15 on natural gas and oil and increasing reliance on renewable energy sources". Yet measuring
16 energy use as adopted by Appendix F is substantially more expansive than the DEIR. language
17 herein.
18 48. The EIR did not discuss any means or methods of avoiding or reducing
19 inefficient, wasteful and unnecessary consumption of energy from this Project as required by
20 Appendix F.
21 49. Evidence obtained through Petitioner's CPRA request, but not otherwise
22 disclosed to the public, illustrates how a lawful energy analysis was omitted from the Project's
23 EIR. The City asked the Real Party in Interest to provide baseline energy data so an Appendix F
24 type analysis could be performed and included in the DEIR. The Real Party in Interest refused tol
25 provide this information and the City, instead of insisting on the data or otherwise gathering the
26 data by some other means, simply dispensed with the obligation to conducting an energy
27 analysis. No controlling decisional law has excused a public agency from producing a legally

sufficient EIR based on the excuse that developer refused to provide the baseline information

2 to conduct the required analysis.

3 50. The EIR failed to satisfy the minimum requirements of CEQA Guidelines
4 Appendix F, CEQA Guidelines §15126.4(a)(1), and Pub.Res.C. $21100(b)(3).

5 51. An environmental impact report cannot dispense with needed analysis by
6 concluding a project complies with Title 24 or other general standards. "Although the Building

7 Code addresses energy savings for components of new commercial construction, it does not

8 address many of the considerations required under appendix F of the CEQA Guidelines. These

9 considerations include whether a building should be constructed at all, how large it should be,

10 where it should be located, whether it should incorporate renewable energy resources, or

11 anything else external to the building's envelope. Here, a requirement that Gateway II at
12 Northgate comply with the Building Code does not, by itself, constitute an adequate assessment

13 of mitigation measures that can be taken to address the energy impacts during construction and

14 operation of the project." California Clean Energy Committee v. City of Woodland (2014) 225
15 Cal. App. 4th 173 211. Thus applying Title 24 is insufficient to assess the effect and mitigation

16 measures.

17 52. This DEIR does exactly what California Clean Energy Committee tells Vallejo it

18 cannot do. The DEIR nakedly concedes:

19 With the incorporation of energy efficiency requirements in the California

20 Building Code and project design features, the project would not result in the
inefficient, wasteful, or unnecessary consumption of energy.
21 DEIR at page 2.0-52. Instead CEQA requires the DEIR to evaluate, assess and quantify the
22 energy impact. The DEIR's truncated method of analysis by-passes an essential aspect of the
23 CEQA process.
24 53. The DEIR incorporated this rejected method of analyzing energy impacts. It
25 offered an improper and truncated analysis pivoting on a failed hypothesis that if a project
26 complies with energy requirements it is therefore unnecessary to evaluate and assess in detail the
27 proposal's potential energy impacts.

54. The Appendix F CEQA mandate is implemented by instructing public agencies:

2 "[p]otentially significant energy implications of a project should be considered in an EIR," and

3 describing several energy-related issues to be evaluated such as energy efficiency, effects to

4 energy supplies, effects on peak and base period demands, compliance with existing energy

5 standards, and transportation energy consumption. Id. at (II)(C). Appendix F explains that

6 compliance starts with the EIR's project description. To produce a legally sufficient analysis, the

7 Guidelines direct an EIR's project description to include a discussion of:

8 09 energy consuming equipment to be used by the project (App. F II.A.1.);
9 energy requirements of the project by fuel type (App. F II.A.2.);
@ energy conservation equipment (App. F II.A.3.);
10 6 energy costs (App F. Il.A.4.); and
e energy consumption per vehicle trip (App F. II.A.5.). 11 Likewise, Appendix F suggests an EIR's "environmental setting" section "include existing

12 energy supplies and energy use patterns in the region and locality."
13 55. The DEIR omits any discussion of energy consuming equipment to be used by the

14 Project, energy requirements of the Project by fuel type, energy conservation equipment, energy
15 costs, or energy consumption per vehicle trip in the "Project Description" section as required by

16 the Guidelines. Further, the environmental setting fails to disclose existing energy supply and
17 use patterns in Vallejo or the surrounding region. Rather, the "Project Description" includes a
18 list of service providers the Project will use for gas and electric service. Moreover, the DEIR

19 omits the baseline information listed in Appendix F.
20 56. The City prejudicially abused its discretion and acted in excess of its jurisdiction
21 by certifying the EIR without first analyzing and/or mitigating the energy impacts of the Project
22 as required by CEQA.

1 57. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained

2 in Paragraphs 1 through 56, above.

3 58. Government Code section 65855 requires a planning commission to "render its

4 decision in the form of a written recommendation to the legislative body." Similarly, companion

5 Government Code section 65856 prohibits a legislative body from holding a public hearing until

6 and unless it receives "the recommendation of the planning commission." These two minimum

7 statutory standards implicitly require a legislative body to receive a valid and lawfully rendered

8 planning commission recommendation before conducting a public hearing to consider a land use
matter. Accordingly, if a planning commission recommendation was produced by an unlawful
10 process or is otherwise defective, then a legislative body lacks sufficient statutory authority to act

11 on the underlying land use application.

12 59. During the PC Hearing, the City committed multiple violations of the Ralph M.
13 Brown Act. Petitioner identified the Brown Act violations in its timely written correspondence
14 to the City dated April 28, 2020 and again in its June 9, 2020 letter to the City Council.

15 60. The City opted not to cure the Brown Act violations by vacating the unlawful PC
16 Hearing and conducting a new hearing consistent with Brown Act requirements. Instead the City
17 conducted a Council Hearing based on a Planning Commission recommendation produced by a
18 process that violated the Brown Act in multiple ways.

19 61. Without receiving a legally valid planning commission recommendation the City

20 failed to act in a manner required by law and violated Government Code sections 65855 and

21 65866 by conducting a public hearing, certifying the EIR and approving the Project.

6 of t hearing necessarily contemplates decision in light of the evidence there introduced. .. ."

7 Clark at 1171-1172 citing with approval English v. City of Long Beach (1950) 35 Cal.2d 155,

158-159.

8 64. Here Petitioner filed a timely CPRA request with the City to receive all relevant
9 public documents concerning the EIR and land use applications related to the Project so that
10

11 Petitioner could prepare for the Council Hearing. City contracted with an outside law firm, Best,

12 Best & Krieger, to process CPRA requests in order to promptly review and disclose requested
public documents.

13 65.

14 Vallejo functionally rejected Petitioner's valid CPRA request by determining it

15 would disclose outstanding public documents related to the Project after but not before the

16 Council Hearing concerning the Project. This violated Petitioner's right to instruct its elected

17 officials and the duty of Vallejo to promptly release public documents.

66.

18 California Constitution Article 1 Section 3(a) gives 1 every citizen the right to

19 "instruct" their government and government representatives.

3 68.

4 By not providing the public documents "promptly" but rather refraining from

5 disclosing the public documents until after a Council Hearing certified the EIR. and approved the

6 Project, the City violated the CPRA, Petitioner's Constitutional Right to instruct its government,

7 and violated Petitioner's Due Process right to confront the evidence relied upon by Vallejo.
69.

8 Vallejo also violated Petitioner's rights by employing a prohibited content biased
time limit at the PC Hearing and Council Hearing: "To permit one side of a debatable public

10 question to have a monopoly in expressing its views to the government is the antithesis of

11 constitutional guarantees. Whatever its duties are as an employer, when the board sits in public
meetings to conduct public business and hear the views of citizens, it may not be required to
12 discriminate between speakers on the basis of their employment, or the content of their speech."

15 70.

16 This rule expressly applies to city council public hearings: "[A]s we intimated in
City of Norwalk, the important thing is not whether we call the meetings highly regulated limited
17 public fora or nonpublic fora. The fact remains that limitations on speech at those meetings must

18

19 be reasonable and viewpoint neutral." Kindt v. Santa Monica Rent Control Bd. (1995) 67 F.3d

20 266, 270-71. Thus, "viewpoint-based restrictions violate the First Amendment regardless of

21 whether they also serve some valid time, place, manner interest. See, e.g., Good News V. Milford

INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO COMPLETE THE COVER SHEET CM-010
To Plaintiffs and Others Filing First Papers. If you are filing a first paper (for example, a complaint) in civil case, you must complete and file, along with your first paper, the Civil Case Cover Sheot contained on page 1. This information will be used to compile statistics about the types and numbers of cases filed. You must complete items through 6 on the sheet. In item 1, you must check one box for the case type that best describes the case. If the case a fits both a general and a more specific type of case listed in item 1, check the more specific one. If the case has multiple causes of action, check the box that best indicates the primary cause of action. To assist you in completing the sheet, examples of the cases that belong under each case type in item 1 are provided below. A cover sheet must be filed only with your initial paper, Failure to file a cover sheet with the first paper filed in a civil case may subject a party, its counsel, or both to sanctions under rules 2.30 and 3.220 of the California Rules of Court.
To Parties in Rule 3.740 Collections Cases. A "collections case" under rule 3.740 is defined as an action for recovery of money owed in a sum stated to be certain that is not more than $25,000, exclusive of interest and attorney's fees, arising from a transaction in which property, services, or money was acquired on credit. A collections case does not include an action seeking the following: (1) tort damages, (2) punitive damages; (3) recovery of real property, (4) recovery of personal property, or (5) a prejudgment writ of attachment. The identification of a case as a rule 3.740 collections case on this form means that it will be exempt from the general time-for-service requirements and case management rules, unless a defendant files a responsive pleading. A rule 3.740 collections case will be subject to the requirements for service and obtaining a judgment in rule 3.740. To Parties in Complex Cases. In complex cases only, parties must also use the Civil Case Cover Sheet to designate whether the is case is complex. If a plaintiff believes the case is complex under rule 3.400 of the California Rules of Court, this must be indicated by completing the appropriate boxes in items 1 and 2. If a plaintiff designates a case as complex, the cover sheet must be served with the complaint on all parties to the action. A defendant may file and serve no later than the time of its first appearance a joinder in the plaintiff's designation, a counter-designation that the case is not complex, or, if the plaintiff has made no designation, a designation that the case is complex.
