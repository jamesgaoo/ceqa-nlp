NOTICE TO CALIFORNIA STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL

1 Planning Commission and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors (each a "Respondent,"

2 and, collectively, the "Respondents") in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The Petition

3 alleges that the Respondents violated the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") by

4 approving a project in such a manner to allow changes to the land use and zoning designations to

5 accommodate the residential components of the Project. The City Council's approval operates in

6 stark contravention of CEQA, Public Resources Code 8 21000 et seq., the CEQA Guidelines,

7 Title 14 California Code of Regulations, § 15000 et seq., and the State Planning and Zoning Law,
Government Code § 65300 et seq. Additionally, Respondents prepared and relied on an initial
study and a mitigated negative declaration that fall well below CEQA's minimum standards.
2. A copy of the petition is attached to this notice.

11 Respectfully, submitted this 3rd day of February 2020. FINNEY ARNOLD LLP
