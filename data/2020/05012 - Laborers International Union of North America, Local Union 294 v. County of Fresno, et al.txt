Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

INTRODUCTION

2 Petitioner and Plaintiff Laborers International Union of North America, Local Union 294
("Petitioner" or "Local 294") petitions this court for a Writ of Mandate ("Petition"*), directed to
3 Respondents and Defendants County of Fresno and Fresno County Board of Supervisors
4 (*Respondents" or the "County") and Real Parties in Interest We Be Jammin, LP and John B. Brelsford
5 ("Real Parties" or "Applicant"), and by this verified petition and complaint, alleges as follows:

6 1. Petitioner brings this action to challenge the unlawful actions of Respondents in

7 approving Initial Study Application No. 7449 and Amendment Application No. 3829 ("Project")

8 because the Initial Study and Mitigated Negative Declaration ("IS/MND") prepared for the Project
failed to satisfy the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public 9 Resources Code ("PRC") § 21000 et seq., and the CEQA Guidelines, title 14, California Code of
10 Regulations, § 15000 et seq. The specific actions challenged are: (1) the County's adoption of the
11 IS/MND prepared for the Project, including the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program; (2) the
12 County's finding that the proposed rezone of 42.6 acres with split zoning [40.1 acres from the AL-20

13 (Limited Agricultural, 20-acre minimum parcel size) Zone District and 2.5 acres from the M-3(c)

14 (Heavy Industrial, Conditional) Zone District, limited to a parking lot] to the M-3(c) (Heavy Industrial,

15 Conditional) Zone District is consistent with the County's General Plan and County-adopted Roosevelt
Community Plan; and (3) the County's approval of an Ordinance pertaining to Amendment Application
16 No. 3829 rezoning the subject 42.6-acre parcel of land to the M-3(c) Zone District to allow limited
17 heavy industrial, general industrial, and light manufacturing uses (collectively, the "Approvals").
18 2. The Project site is located on the southeast corner of E. Central Avenue and S. Willow

19 Avenue, approximately 3,002 feet east of the nearest city limits of City of Fresno. The Project proposes

20 to rezone the entire 42.6-acre Project site parcel to M-3(c) to allow limited heavy industrial, general

21 industrial, and light manufacturing uses. Currently, the Project parcel has split zoning. 2.5-acres of the
site is zoned M-3(c) (Heavy Industrial, Conditional) and the remaining 40.1-acres are zoned AL-20
22 (Limited Agriculture, 20-acre minimum parcel size).
23 3. Petitioner submitted evidence from experts explaining that the proposed Project may
24 have significant environmental effects on air quality, human health, greenhouse gas emissions, and

25 biological resources and that the County failed to disclose, analyze, and mitigate these potentially

26 significant effects. Respondents violated CEQA by failing to prepare an EIR for the Project despite

27 substantial evidence in the record of a fair argument that the Project may have significant environmental
effects.
28 4. Because the IS/MND violates several of CEQA's requirements, the approvals that are

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 reliant upon it must be overturned. Therefore, Petitioner respectfully requests that the Court direct

2 Respondents to set aside the IS/MND and Project Approvals.
PARTIES
3 5. Petitioner and Plaintiff Laborers International Union of North America, Local Union 294
4 ("Local 294") is a labor organization with members who live and work in Fresno County. Local 294's
5 purposes include advocating on behalf of its members to ensure safe workplace environments; working

6 to protect recreational opportunities for its members to improve its members' quality of life when off the

7 job; advocating to assure its members access to safe, healthful, productive, and aesthetically and

8 culturally pleasing surroundings on and off the job; promoting environmentally sustainable businesses
and development projects on behalf of its members, including providing comments raising
9 environmental concerns and benefits on proposed development projects; advocating for changes to
10 proposed development projects that will help to achieve a balance between employment, the human
11 population, and resource use to permit high standards of living and a wide sharing of life's amenities by
12 its members as well as the general public; advocating for steps to preserve important historic, cultural,

13 and natural aspects of our national heritage, and maintain, wherever possible, an environment that

14 supports diversity and variety of individual choice; advocating on behalf of its members for programs,

15 policies, and development projects that promote not only good jobs but also a healthy natural
environment and working environment, including advocating for changes to proposed projects and
16 policies that, if adopted, would reduce air, soil, and water pollution, minimize harm to wildlife, conserve
17 wild places, reduce traffic congestion, reduce global warming impacts, and assure compliance with
18 applicable land use ordinances; and working to attain the widest range of beneficial uses of the

19 environment without degradation, risk to health or safety, or other undesirable or unintended

20 I consequences.
6.
21 Local 294 and its members have a direct and beneficial interest in Respondents'
compliance with laws bearing upon approval of the Project. These interests will be directly and
22 adversely affected by the Project, which violates the law as set forth in this Petition. The maintenance
23 and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on the public by protecting the public
24 from the environmental and other harms alleged below and others that may exist but are unknown due to

25 the lack of a full environmental analysis. Local 294 and its members submitted comments to the

26 County's Department of Public Works and Planning, Development Services and Capital Proejcts and the

27 Board of Supervisors objecting to and commenting on the Project and its unsupported and inadequate

28 environmental review pursuant to CEOA.
7. Respondent and Defendant County of Fresno is the "lead agency" for the Project for

2
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

purposes of Public Resources Code § 21067, and has principal responsibility for conducting

2 environmental review for the Project and taking other actions necessary to comply with CEQA.
8. Respondent and Defendant the Fresno County Board of Supervisors (*Board of
3 Supervisors") serves as the elected governing body of the County of Fresno. The Board of Supervisors
4 is vested with all the powers of the County including reviewing and approving certain development
5 plans and complying with the requirements of state laws. Respondent Board of Supervisors is

6 ultimately responsible for reviewing and approving or denying the Project. The Board of Supervisors

7 voted on February 4, 2020 to approve the Project, including adopting the IS/MND.
9. 8 Real Party in Interest We Be Jammin, LP is a limited partnership organized under the
laws of the State of California. "We Be Jammin, LP" is identified in the Notice of Determination as the
9 Project Sponsor. Specifically, the Project Sponsor is listed as "John B. Brelsford on behalf of We Be
10 Jammin, LP, a California Limited Partnership." Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereupon
11 alleges that We Be Jammin, LP is Project applicant.

12 10. Real Party in Interest John B. Brelsford is an individual. On information and belief, Mr.

13 Brelsford principal place of residence is in Fresno, California. Mr. Brelsford is identified in the Notice

14 of Determination as the Project Sponsor. Specifically, the Project Sponsor is listed as "John B.

15 Brelsford on behalf of We Be Jammin, LP, a California Limited Partnership." Petitioner is informed
and believes, and thereupon alleges that John B. Brelsford is a Project applicant.
16 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
17 11. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of
18 Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21167, 21168 and

19 21168.5.

20 12. Venue is proper in Fresno County Superior Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

21 section 395 because the Project at issue is located in the County of Fresno, and pursuant to
13. Venue is proper in Fresno County Superior Court pursuant California Code of Civil
22 Procedure sections 394 (actions against a city, county, or local agency) and 395 (actions generally)
23 because Respondents' main offices are located in the County of Fresno, the activities authorized by
24 Respondents will occur in the County of Fresno, and the causes of action alleged in this Petition arose in

25 the County of Fresno.

26 14. Petitioner will comply with the requirements of Public Resources Code section 21167.7

27 by sending a copy of this Petition and Complaint to the California Attorney General.
EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
28 15. Petitioner has performed or will perform all conditions precedent to the filing of this

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 Petition. Petitioner has actively participated in the administrative and environmental review process

2 prior to the close of the public hearings on the Project and before the issuance of the notice of
determination. Petitioner has fully exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law.
3 (Pub. Res. Code, § 21177(a).)
4 16. Respondents have taken final agency actions adopting the IS/MND and adopting the
5 Approvals. Respondents had a mandatory duty to comply with all applicable laws, including, but not

6 limited to CEQA prior to undertaking the discretionary approvals at issue in this lawsuit. Petitioner

7 possesses no effective remedy to challenge the Approvals at issue in this action other than by means of
this lawsuit.
8
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
9 17. On February 4, 2020, the Board of Supervisors approved the Project and adopted the
10 IS/MND for the Project.
11 18. On February 5, 2020, Respondents posted Notice of Determination ("NOD") for the
12 approvals of the Project.

13 19. The statute of limitations for a CEQA challenge to Respondent's decision to approve a

14 Project and certify the Project EIR expires 30 days from the filing and posting of the NOD. (Guidelines,

15 §§ 15094, subd. (g), 15112, subd. (c)(1).) The 30th day after the February 5, 2020 NOD is March 6,
2020.
16 20. Petitioner has filed this Petition prior to the expiration of any applicable statute of
17 limitations.

18 NOTICE OF CEQA SUIT

19 21. On March 5, 2020, Petitioner served a notice of their intent to file this lawsuit, in

20 accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5. (See Exhibit 1: Notice of Intent to File
Petition Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act.) 21 PREPARATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD
22 22. Pursuant to Public Resources Code, section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), Petitioner elects
23 to prepare the record of proceedings in this action. (See Exhibit 2: Petitioner's Notice of Intent to
24 Prepare Record.)

25 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

26 23. Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil

27 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights affecting
the public interest.
28 24. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit on the

4
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 general public by requiring Respondents to carry out their duties under CEQA and other applicable

2 laws before approving the Project.
25. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will also result in the enforcement of
3 important rights affecting the public interest by compelling Respondents to engage in a legally adequate
4 analysis of the Project, and to ensure that the public has a meaningful opportunity to review and
5 comment on the impacts and mitigation measures for the Project.

6 26. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement make an award of attorneys' fees

7 appropriate in this case. Without this Petition, Respondents and Real Parties will proceed with a plan

8 and development that will cause significant, unmitigated environmental impacts that might otherwise
have been reduced or avoided through legally adequate environmental review and the adoption of
feasible mitigation measures.
10 IRREPARABLE HARM
11 27. Petitioner and its members live and/or work near the Project site and in the County of
12 Fresno. They have been and will continue to be harmed by Respondents' failure to provide

13 environmental documents that accurately and fully inform interested persons of the Project's true

14 impacts, and mitigate those impacts. Such documents would lead to better environmental decision-

15 making regarding the Project, and would enable all residents, land owners, and business owners in the
affected region to better understand the true environmental impacts of the Project.
16 28. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless
17 this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their approval of the
18 Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' decisions will remain in effect in violation of

19 State law and Petitioner will be irreparably harmed. No monetary damages or legal remedy could fully

20 and adequately compensate Petitioner for that harm.
LEGAL BACKGROUND
21 29. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision makers and
22 the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. (14 Cal. Code Regs.
23 ("CEQA Guidelines") § 15002(a)(1).) Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce
24 | environmental damage when "feasible" by requiring "environmentally superior" alternatives and all

25 feasible mitigation measures. (CEQA Guidelines § 15002(a)(2) and (3).)

26 30. CEQA requires that a lead agency analyze the potential environmental impacts of its

27 proposed actions in an EIR except in certain limited circumstances. (See Pub. Resources Code, §
21100.) The EIR is the very heart of CEQA. (Bakersfield Citizens for Local Control v. City of
28 Bakersfield (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1184, 1214; Pocket Protectors v. City of Sacramento (2004) 124

5
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

- Cal.App.4th 903, 927.) The EIR is an "environmental "alarm bell' whose purpose is to alert the public

2 and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached the ecological points of

3 no return." (Bakersfield Citizens, 124 Cal.App.4th at 1220.) The EIR also functions as a "document of

4 accountability," intended to "demonstrate to an apprehensive citizenry that the agency has, in fact,

5 analyzed and considered the ecological implications of its action." (Laurel Heights Improvements Assn.

6 V. Regents of University of California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.) The EIR process "protects not only
the environment but also informed self-government." (Pocket Protectors, 124 Cal.App.4th at 927.)

7 31. CEQA requires that an agency analyze the potential environmental effects of its proposed

8 actions in an EIR if "there is substantial evidence, in light of the whole record before the lead agency,

9 that the project may have a significant effect on the environment." (Pub. Res. Code §21080(d).) A

10 "project" is the whole of an action" directly undertaken or supported by a public agency "which may

11 cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical

12 change in the environment." (PRC §21065; CCR §15378(a).) The project description must be accurate,
stable, and finite. (County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 192.)

13 32.

14 A lead agency may not limit environmental disclosure by ignoring the development that
will ultimately result from an initial approval. (City of Antioch v. City Council (1986) 187 Cal.App.3d

15 1325.) Under CEQA's definition of a project, although a project may go through several approval

16 stages, the environmental review accompanying the first discretionary approval must evaluate the

17 impacts of the ultimate development authorized by that approval." (Kostka & Zischke, Practice Under

18 the California Environmental Quality Act (CEB 2017), § 6.31, p. 6-26. (citing 14 CCR § 15003(h);

19 Bozung v. LAFCO (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 283.) CEQA does not permit piecemeal environmental review
that ignores the environmental impact of the end result. (See, City of Carmel-by-the-Sea v. Bd. of

20 Supervisors (1986) 183 Cal.App.3d 229, 251.)

21 33. "CEQA requires the preparation of an EIR "whenever it can be fairly argued on the basis

22 of substantial evidence that the project may have significant environmental impact. Quail Botanical

23 Gardens Found., Inc. V. City of Encinitas (1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1597, 1602 (quoting No Oil, Inc. V.

24 City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75). The point is to "impose a low threshold requirement for

25 preparation of an EIR." No Oil, 13 Cal.3d at 84. By definition, "expert opinion supported by fact"
constitutes substantial evidence. PRC §21080(e)(1); 14 CCR §15064(f)(5).

26 34. CEQA Guidelines demand that where experts have presented conflicting evidence on the

27 extent of the environmental effects of a project, the agency must consider the environmental effects to

28 be significant and prepare an EIR. (CEQA Guidelines § 15064(f)(5); Pub. Res. Code § 21080(e)(1);
Pocket Protectors,124 Cal.App.4th at 935.)

6
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 35. A project may have a significant effect on the environment if "possible effects of a

2 project are individually limited but cumulatively considerable," meaning "that the incremental effects of
an individual project are considerable when viewed in connection with the effects of past projects, the
3 effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable future projects." (Pub. Res. Code
4 §21083(b)(2).) The definition of "cumulative impacts" is "two or more individual effects which, when
5 considered together, are considerable or which compound or increase other environmental impacts."

6 (CEQA Guidelines §15355.)

7 36. "[U]nder CEQA, the lead agency bears a burden to investigate potential environmental

8 impacts. "If the local agency has failed to study an area of possible environmental impact, a fair
argument may be based on the limited facts in the record. Deficiencies in the record may actually
9 enlarge the scope of fair argument by lending a logical plausibility to a wider range of inferences.'
10 (Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296, 311. County Sanitation Dist. No. 2 v.
11 County of Kern (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 1544.)
12 37. If a project may have a significant effect on the environment, the agency may approve the

13 project only if it has "[e]liminated or substantially lessened all significant effects on the environment

14 where feasible" and finds that any unavoidable significant effects on the environment are "acceptable
due to overriding concerns." (14 CCR §15092(b)(2).) 15 38. If a proposed project "would not have a significant effect on the environment," then the
16 "lead agency" prepares "negative declaration" or a "mitigated negative declaration" instead of an EIR.
17 (Pub. Res. Code §§21064, 21064.5, 21080(c).)
18 39. A mitigated negative declaration is proper only if project revisions would avoid or

19 mitigate the potentially significant effects identified in an initial study "to a point where clearly no

20 significant effect on the environment would occur, and ... there is no substantial evidence in light of the

21 whole record before the public agency that the project, as revised, may have a significant effect on the
environment." (Pub. Res. Code $$21064.5, 21080(c)(2).) But "if a lead agency is presented with a fair a
22 argument that a project may have a significant effect on the environment, the lead agency shall prepare
23 an EIR even though it may also be presented with other substantial evidence that the project will not
24 have significant effect." (Arviv Enterprise v. South Valley Area Planning Com. (2002) 101

25 Cal.App.4th 1333, 1345-46.)

26 STATEMENT OF FACTS
40.
27 On November 1, 2019 the County released the IS/MND for public review and comment
on the Project.
28 41. On December 9, 2019, Petitioner submitted written comments to the County stating that

7
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 IS/MND failed to comply with CEQA. Petitioner's comments included comments prepared by expert

2 consultants. Petitioners also provided oral comments to the Fresno County Planning Commission at its
December 12, 2019 mecting, and to the Board of Supervisors at its February 4, 2020 meeting.
3 The IS/MND Piecemeals the Project and Fails to Analyze the Whole of the Action
4 42. The entire IS/MND violates CEQA because the County did not analyze the "whole of
5 the action," which includes the reasonably foreseeable construction and operation of an industrial

6 building at the Project site. By rezoning the Project site from agricultural uses to heavy industrial uses,

7 it is reasonably foresecable that an industrial project will be developed at the Project site. The County's

8 environmental review was required to extend to the development envisioned by the initial approvals,
even though further discretionary approvals may be required before development can occur. Instead,
9 the IS/MND analyzes only the direct environmental impact from the zone change on the environment,
10 failing to analyze the indirect the impacts from the development that will follow. The County
11 improperly limited the IS/MND's disclosure of environmental impacts by ignoring the development

12 that will ultimately result from approval of the Project.

13 43. By considering only the environmental impacts of the zone change now, and considering

14 the environmental impacts of the industrial development that will occur at the Project site at some

15 future time, the County has also violated CEQA by piecemealing the Project.
Incomplete and Inconsistent Project Deseription
16 44. In addition to being improperly narrow, the IS/MND's description of the Project also
17 violates CEQA because it is inconsistent and incomplete. The Project description is incomplete
18 because it fails to disclose the whole of the action sought to ultimately be approved.

19 45. Further, the IS/MND's description of the Project is internally inconsistent and fluctuates

20 based on which environmental impact is being analyzed. The IS/MND begins by describing the Project

21 as rezoning all 42.6 acres of the Project site to "M-3(c) Zone District to allow limited heavy industrial,
general industrial, and light manufacturing uses as requested by the Applicant." (Initial Study, p. 1.)
22 Yet in the Air Quality and Greenhouse Gas Analysis, the Project is described and is analyzed as "a
23 conditional zoning that would limit the site to construction of 700,000-square feet of warehousing and
24 other similar uses." (Air Quality and Greenhouse Gas Analysis, p. 5.) Similarly, the Traffic Impact

25 Study analyzes "a conditional zoning that would limit the site to construction of 700,000 square feet of

26 warehousing and other similar uses." (Traffic Impact Study, p. 1.)
46.
27 Making matters worse, the Fresno Planning Commission Staff Report for the Project
stated that the Project would rezone the land to "M-3(c) Zone District to allow limited industrial uses as
28 listed in Zoning Ordinance Section 845.1, 844.1, 843.1 and Exhibit 6.3 Staff Report, pp. 2, 7, and 11.

8
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 Fresno Zoning Ordinance Sections 845.1, 844.1, 843.1 list all uses permitted in an M-3 zone, while

2 Exhibit 6 lists a subset of those uses. Page 3 of the Staff Report then states that "[f]uture site
development will be limited to uses listed in Exhibit 6." Not only are these statements inconsistent
3 within the Staff Report, but the MND makes no mention of Exhibit 6 to the Staff Report or the
4 limitation of land uses to some subset of what is permitted in an M-3(c) zone under the Zoning
5 Ordinance. These inconsistencies in the Project description violates CEQA's requirement that project

6 descriptions must be accurate, stable, and finite.

7 The Project's Biological Impacts
47. Petitioner submitted the
8 expert comments of wildlife biologist Dr. Shawn Smallwood,
Ph.D. Dr. Smallwood noted that the IS/MND failed to address the Project's potential significant
9 impacts on wildlife at and in the vicinity of the Project site. The IS/MND was informed by only a single
10 site visit by an unidentified biologist(s) who started at an unreported time and continued for an
11 unreported amount of time. Morcover, Dr. Smallwood noted that the IS/MND improperly dismisses or
12 understates the potential for impacts to certain special-status species to occur at the Project site without

13 proper justification.

14 48. Dr. Smallwood's comments indicate that, because of the absence of sufficient surveys of
wildlife at the site, the IS/MND overlooked numerous species actually or likely frequenting the Project 15. site, including Cooper's hawk, red-tailed hawk, and 39 other special-status species of birds that have
16 been observed near the Project site. As a result, the baseline for wildlife impacts relied upon by the
17 IS/MND is insufficient as a matter of law and not supported by substantial evidence.
18 49. Dr. Smallwood concluded that the Project may have significant impacts on Cooper's

19 hawk, red-tailed hawk, 39 other special-status species of birds, and bats. The IS/MND for the Project

20 violates CEQA by failing to analyze these potentially significant impacts in an EIR.
50.
21 Dr. Smallwood identified the IS/MND's failure to address wildlife impacts from vehicle
collisions due to increased traffic from the Project. Dr. Smallwood's comments explain that vehicle
22 collisions have accounted for the deaths of millions of reptile, amphibian, mammal, bird, and arthropod
23 fauna each year, and the impacts have often been found to be significant at the population level.
24 Increased use of existing roads will increase wildlife fatalities. Dr. Smallwood conducted wildlife

25 fatality counts along routes that will be travelled by trucks and other vehicles associated with the

26 Project. Based on the reported number and location of trips from the Project and Dr. Smallwood's

27 research, he expects the fatality rates he has observed to increase from the Project's traffic levels. Dr.
Smallwood's expert comments constitute substantial evidence that the Project may have a significant 28 impact on biological resources, requiring preparation of an EIR. The IS/MND fails to analyze this

9
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

P potentially significant impact.
51. Dr. Smallwood also determined that the Project may have significant impact on 2 wildlife movement. Without any analysis of the Project's potential interference with wildlife
3 movement in the area, and stating only that no migratory movement corridor exists in south Fresno, the
4 IS/MND concludes that the Project will have no impact on wildlife movement. But Dr. Smallwood
5 points out that Fresno is in fact located right in the middle of the Pacific Flyway - a world famous

6 corridor trafficked by millions of birds every year. Even if this were not the case, the IS/MND's

7 analysis of impacts on wildlife movement still violates CEQA because it relies on an inaccurate CEQA

8 analysis that implies that a migratory movement corridor must exist for interference of wildlife
movement to quality as significant. The CEQA standard goes to wildlife movement regardless of
9 whether the movement is channeled by a wildlife corridor. According to Dr. Smallwood, the Project
10 site is "critically important for wildlife movement because it composes an increasingly diminishing
11 patch of open space within a growing expanse of residential and industrial uses." Dr. Smallwood

12 concluded that the "project would cut wildlife off from stopover and staging habitat, and would

13 therefore interfere with wildlife movement in the region."
52. Dr. Smallwood notes the IS/MND contains no analysis of potential cumulative impacts 14

15 on biological resources. The County was required to analyze the Project's biological impacts
individual and cumulatively. Failing to do so violated CEQA.
16 The Project's Potentially Contaminated Soil
17 53. The existence of toxic soil contamination at a project site is a significant impact
18 requiring review and mitigation in an EIR. (McQueen v. Bd. of Dirs. (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136,

19 1149; Assoc. For A Cleaner Env't v. Yosemite Comm. College Dist. ("ACE v. Yosemite") (2004) 116

20 Cal.App.4th 629.) Sensitive residential receptors are located less than 100-feet from the Project

21 boundaries. Both construction workers and nearby residents can be exposed to pesticide-containing dust
when the Project site is developed and earth-moving activities begin.
22 54. Petitioner submitted the expert comments of environmental consulting firm,
23 Soil/Water/Air Protection Enterprise ("SWAPE"). SWAPE noted that, for decades, the Project site was
24 used for agricultural purposes and as an automobile wrecking yard. According to SWAPE, residual

25 pesticides from agriculture or leaked chemicals from the wrecking yard may exist at the Project site that

26 would pose a risk to construction workers and nearby residents. Despite this risk, a Phase ]

27 Environmental Site Assessment ("ESA") was never prepared for the Project site. According to
SWAPE, Phase I ESA's are conducted to identify conditions indicative of releases of hazardous
28 substances. They identify hazardous waste issues that may pose a risk to the public, workers, or the

10
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

environment, and that may require further investigation, including environmental sampling and

2 cleanup. Without a Phase I ESA, or any other evidence regarding potentially hazardous soil conditions
at the Project site, the IS/MND has not established an environmental baseline against which to measure
3 environmental impacts. Moreover, without knowing the presence and levels of these chemicals, the
4 IS/MND cannot justify its conclusion that human exposure impacts are unlikely, and that the Project
5 poses no significant risks from the release of hazardous materials into the environment.

6 Insufficient Air Quality Analysis

7 55. SWAPE also commented that the County underestimated air pollution from the Project.

8 The reasons for this conclusion include that: (a) the air modeling was based on an unsubstantiated

9 reduction in carbon intensity factor; (b) the air modeling was based on an unsubstantiated change to
operational off-road equipment fuel types; (c) the air modeling was based on an unsubstantiated change
10 to solid waste generation rate; (d) the air modeling was based on an unsubstantiated change to water-
11 related electricity intensity factors, water use rate, and energy intensity values; and (e) the air modeling

12 was based on an unsubstantiated changes to fleet mix.

13 56. SWAPE also concluded that IS/MND improperly concluded that the Project will not

14 have an adverse impact on human health from diesel particulate matter for the following reasons: (a)

15 the County did not conduct a quantified Health Risk Assessment ("HRA") for the Project's
construction emissions; (b) the operational HRA that was conducted was improperly limited to onsite
16 equipment, composting, and roadway traffic, and failed to include diesel emissions from other
17 operational activities like product use, architectural coatings, space and water heating, refrigeration,
18 office uses, and lighting, among others; (c) the IS/MND did not contain an analysis of the cumulative

19 health risk impacts of project construction and operation; (d) the IS/MND does not contain an analysis

20 of cumulative lifetime cancer risks to nearby sensitive receptors; and (e) the HRA that is included in the
IS/MND relies on emissions estimates from an air model that contains incorrect and unsubstantiated
21 input parameters, as discussed above.
22 57. SWAPE prepared screening-level HRA to evaluate potential impacts from the
23 construction and operation of the Project. SWAPE found that the excess cancer risk for children at a
24 sensitive receptor located approximately 25 meters away over the course of Project operation is

25 approximately 21 in one million, which exceeds the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District

26 (*SJVAPCD") threshold of significance of 20 in one million. Moreover, the excess lifetime cancer risk

27 over the course of a Project operation is approximately 33 in one million, which again exceeds the
SJAPCD threshold of significance of 20 in one million. This establishes a fair argument that the Project
28 will a have a significant impact on human health and an EIR is required.

11
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 The Project's Greenhouse Gas Impact
58.
2 SWAPE concluded that the IS/MND failed to adequately analyze and mitigate the
potential adverse impacts of the Project from greenhouse gases ("GHG"). SWAPE found that the
3 IS/MND used an incorrect CalEEMod model and failed to correctly compare the Project's annual GHG
4 emissions to a business-as-usual ("BAU") scenario. In addition, SWAPE determined that the IS/MND

5 improperly relies on consistency with the CARB scoping plan to make a project-level significance

6 determination despite the fact that the CARB scoping plan is not an approved climate action plan

7 ("CAP"). Based on these errors, the IS/MND conclusion that the Project will not have a significant

8 greenhouse gas impact is not supported by substantial evidence.
59. SWAPE also concluded that the Project will have a significant GHG impact because the
9 Project exceeds the SJVAPCD significance threshold for GHG emissions, which requires:
10 I demonstration of at least a 29% reduction in project-specific GHG emissions from BAU GHG
11 emissions. SWAPE's greenhouse gas model demonstrates that even after mitigation, the Project's

12 operational GHG emissions will be 8,102.74 MT CO2e/year. Id. When compared to the BAU GHG

:13 emissions of 9,756 MT C02e/year, this is only a 16.95% reduction in emissions compared to the BAU

14 scenario. Since the Project's GHG emissions, compared to BAU, fail to meet the threshold of at least a

a
15. 29% reduction from BAU, SWAPE's analysis is substantial evidence that the Project may have
significant GHG impact.
16 The Project's Impact on Agricultural Resources
17 60. is There is no evidence to support the IS/MND's conclusion that the Project will not have a
18 significant impact on agricultural land. Changing the zoning for the Project site from agricultural to

19 industrial is itself evidence that the Project will conflict with existing agricultural zoning on the

20 property, which constitutes a potentially significant impact. Moreover, the County's conclusion that

21 the Project will not "involve other changes in the existing environment which, due to their location or
nature, could result in conversion of Farmland to non-agricultural uses..." is not supported by evidence.
22 The Project's only purpose is to allow for development permitted under heavy industrial zoning
23 category M-3 rather than the current agricultural uses. The failure of the IS/MND to acknowledge and
24 analyze these potential impacts, including the cumulative impacts from the ongoing reduction of

25 farmland in the area, violates CEQA.

26 Insufficient Traffic Analysis
61.
27 Traffic engineer Daniel Smith, P.E., commented on traffic issues surrounding the
Project. Mr. Smith concluded that the IS/MND underestimated the Project's potential traffic impacts.
28 To determine the Project's impact on traffic, the IS/MND evaluates the Project as ITE Land Use

12
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 Category 154, High-Cube Transload and Short Term Storage Warehouse. According to Mr. Smith, of

2 the broad array of industrial uses allowed on property zoned M3-(c), "ITE Land Use Category 154,
High-Cube Transload and Short Term Storage Warehouse" is the lightest trip generating use. The
3 traffic study attempts to justify this choice on the grounds that "the applicant proposes a conditional
4 zoning that would limit the site to construction of 700,000 square feet of warehousing and other similar
5 uses," but the IS/MND does not actually limit the use of the Project site to "construction of 700,000

6 square feet of warehousing and other similar uses." Morcover, no explanation is given as to what

7 "other similar uses" may entail in the IS/MND. Mr. Smith found that if one of the many other

8 industrial uses permitted on M3-(c)-zoned land are constructed, such as a manufacturing or an
industrial park, the Project's traffic impact would be much greater. As analyzed, the IS/MND
9 concludes that the Project would generate 56 AM and 70 PM peak trips. (Traffic Impact Study, p. 5.)
10 According to Mr. Smith, if the land is used for manufacturing instead, the Project would instead
11 generate 434 AM and 469 PM. The IS/MND was required to analyze and disclose the Project's full
12  potential traffic impact if the property is developed with one of the more intense industrial uses
13 permitted in the M3-(c) zone.

14 Inadequate Analysis of Cumulative Impacts
62.
15. The IS/MND's cumulative impacts analysis does not comply with CEQA's requirements
for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, the following: (a) the IS/MND is internally
16 inconsistent finding at various points that the Project both will and will not have significant cumulative
17 impacts on air quality, cultural resources, and transportation; (b) the IS/MND never analyzes
18 cumulative impacts for any environmental impact other than air quality; (c) the IS/MND does not

19 mention any past, present, or reasonably foreseeable future projects that were analyzed cumulatively

20 with the Project; and (d) the IS/MND improperly dismissed the potential for cumulative impacts if a

21 project-level impact is less than significant.
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
22 Violation of CEQA
63.
23 Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs, in their
entirety, as if fully set forth herein.
24 64. The County violated CEQA when it approved the Project by failing to adequately
25 analyze and mitigate the Project's impacts for the following reasons:
26 A. The IS/MND fails to establish baseline or environmental setting against which to

27 compare the Project's environmental impacts;

28 B. The IS/MND fails to adequately analyze and mitigate impacts on biological
resources, including impacts to the movement of biological resources;

13
Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

1 C. The IS/MND fails to adequately analyze and mitigate impacts the Project's impacts
on human health from potentially contaminated soil at the Project site; 2 D. The IS/MND fails to adequately analyze and mitigate impacts on human health from
m 74n the Project's emissions of diesel particulate matter;
E. The IS/MND fails to adequately analyze and mitigate impacts to agricultural

resources;

6 F. The IS/MND fails to adequately analyze and mitigate the Project's GHG impacts.

7 G. The IS/MND's traffic analysis failed to analyze the full potential scope of the
Project; 8
H. The IS/MND fails to adequately analyze and mitigate any of the Project's
9 cumulative impacts, and there is no evidence to support the conclusion that the
10 Project will have no significant cumulative impacts;
11 65. The County violated CEQA by failing to prepare an EIR for the Project despite the

12 substantial evidence in the record of a fair argument that the Project may have one or more significant

13 environmental impacts, including but not limited to the following:

14 A. There is substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that the Project will have a

15. significant impact on biological resources;

16 B. There is substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that the Project's emissions
17 of diesel particulate matter will significantly impact human health.

18 C. There is substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that the Project will have a

19 significant greenhouse gas impact.

20 is D. There is substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that the Project will have a

21 significant impact on agricultural resources;
66.
22 The County violated CEQA by approving an IS/MND that failed to adequately describe
the Project consistently, and did not analyze the whole of the action being approved, thereby 23 piecemealing the Project.
24 67. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by
25 a approving the Project in a manner that does not comply with the requirements of CEQA and Petitioner
26 is entitled to issuance of a writ of mandate setting aside all approvals that were issued in reliance on the

27 | Addendum.

Among other issues, Petitioner will allege that Respondent failed to proceed in the manner required by law and without substantial evidence by adopting an MND rather than
requiring an EIR despite substantial evidence of potentially significant environmental impacts; by approving an MND that is not supported by substantial evidence and fails to adequately describe the project, and fails to properly disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's potential
significant individual and cumulative impacts. and fails to support proper findings required by
CEQA. The petition being filed will seek the following relief:

1. 2. For a stay pending trial of Respondents' decisions approving the Project.
For a peremptory writ of mandate ordering:
a. Respondents to vacate and set aside adoption of the MND for the Project
and decisions approving the project;
b. Respondents and Real Parties in Interest to suspend all activity under the MND and approval of the Project that could result in any change or alternation to the physical environment until Respondents have taken all
actions necessary to bring the certification and Project approvals into
compliance with CEQA; and
C. Respondents to prepare, circulate, and consider an MND or EIR in
compliance with CEQA prior to any subsequent action to approve the
Project.
3. For the costs of suit.
4. For an award of attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5 and

5. any other applicable provisions of law or equity. other equitable or legal relief that the Court considers just and proper. For any
Petitioner urges Respondents to rescind their approval of the MND and the approvals for the Project, to conduct the appropriate environmental review, and to prepare the appropriate CEQA document for the Project as required by law.
