Moranville v. City of San Diego Page 1 Writ Petition

1 INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the approvals by Respondent City of San Diego ("City" or

3 "Respondent") of the Pearl Street Mixed Use project ("Project"), related Coastal Development Permit

4 No. 2356322, and the related failure to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act

5 ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code § 21000, et seq.

6 2. Among other things, the City failed to comply with the La Jolla Community Plan and Local

7 Coastal Program Land Use Plan and the San Diego Municipal Code. The City violated San Diego

8 Municipal Code requirements concerning Coastal Development Permits, density bonuses, and the La

9 Jolla Planned District. It also failed to consider the environmental impacts associated with the Project,

10 failed to prepare and circulate required environmental analysis, and failed to consider feasible

11 alternatives and mitigation.

12 3. Among other things, Petitioners seek alternative and peremptory writs of mandate declaring
13 the City's approvals invalid, and enjoining the City from taking steps to implement the approvals.

14 Petitioners also seek a temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction and/or permanent injunction

15 enjoining the City from taking any steps to implement the approvals.

0 PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY

10 9. The approximately 0.48-acre Project Site ("Site") is located at 801 Pearl Street in the La

11 Jolla Community Plan and Local Coastal Program Land Use Plan ("Community Plan") area of San

12 Diego, California.

13 10. The Site is bordered by Pearl Street to the north, Bishop Lane to the east, Eads Avenue to

14 the west, and two one-story, single-family homes, including Petitioners' home, to the south.

15 11. The Site is within both the La Jolla Planned District Zone 4 and the RM-1-1 Zone.

16 12. The Site's location in the La Jolla Planned District 4 Zone 4 along the Pearl Street corridor is
17 characterized by neighborhood serving commercial uses with small retail shops. The neighborhood
18| immediately south of the Site is characterized by low-scale residential uses.

19 13. The Site was formerly used as an automobile service station.

20 14. In August 2016, the City's Planning Commission issued several approvals for the Site

21 permitting the demolition and removal of the then existing automobile service station and construction

22 of mixed-use project with four commercial units and 12 residential condominium units with an

23 underground parking garage ("2016 Approval"). Along with the 2016 Approval, the City adopted

24 Negative Declaration No. 294307.

25 15. The 2016 Approval expired on August 30, 2019 because no work had been commenced.

26 16. On September 25, 2019, Real Parties submitted an application seeking approvals for the

27 Project at the Site.

28 ///

Moranville v. City of San Diego Page 3
Writ Petition

1 17. The Project proposes to clear the Site of the automobile service station and to construct a

2 20,606 square-foot, multi-level mixed use development with two commercial units, 26 residential

3 a units, and a 22 stall street-level parking garage. The Project proposes to construct six ground-floor,

4 multi-level residential units with sub-grade basements. The Project also proposes 20 second-floor

5 residential units with what the Project plans depict as elevated "attic" areas accessible by stairs and

6 open to the main floor of each respective residential unit.

7 18. In October 2019, Community members contacted City staff to raise concerns about the

8 proposed Project and its potential impacts. Community members contacted City staff to raise concerns

9 about the Project including, among other things, impacts to traffic and public safety. Community

10 members also noted several concerns, including concerns about the Project's handling of parking

11 spaces, fulfillment of handicapped requirements, proposed density, bulk and scale, transition to

12 neighboring structures, inconsistency with the Community Plan, and impacts to parking, safety, and

13 community character.

14 19. On November 12, 2019, the La Jolla Development Permit Review Committee of the La

15 Jolla Community Planning Association held a public meeting concerning the Project. During the

16 meeting, community members raised several concerns, including concerns about the Project's density

17 and impacts to traffic, parking, pedestrian and bicyclist safety, soil contaminants at the Site, and the

18 Project's proposed changes from the prior 2016 Approval. Commenters also raised concerns about,

19 among other things, the potential use of the Project for short-term rentals rather than the proposed

20 residential use.

21 20. On November 19, 2019, the La Jolla Development Permit Review Committee held another

22 meeting concerning the Project. During the meeting, concerns were raised about the Project's close

23 proximity to the residences south of the Site. In addition, commenters noted concerns about, among

24 other things, the Project's impacts to traffic and safety due to the location of the proposed parking lot,

25 and concerns about management of parking and impacts to the surrounding neighborhood.

26 Community members also raised concerns about the use of the Project for transient or short-term

27 rentals, and the Project's aesthetic impacts to the surrounding area. Additionally, concerns were raised

28 about the unavailability of environmental review documents for the Project.

Moranville v. City of San Diego Writ Petition Page 4

1 21. At the November 19, 2019 meeting, the La Jolla Development Permit Review Committee

2 first voted 2-4-1 against a motion that the required findings could be made for the Project. At the same

3 meeting, the La Jolla Development Permit Review Committee then voted 4-2-1 to approve a motion

4 resolving: "Findings CANNOT be made because intensification of density above the base zoning

5 density is not appropriate to the level of affordable housing provided and does not achieve[] the desired

6 benefit per the community plan. [Two] units is not enough. Additionally the transition to lower density

7 residential directly to the South is not adequate."

8 22. On November 25, 2019, concerned with the Project's potential impacts, Petitioners

9 submitted a request for public records to the City seeking, among other things, any report or analysis of
10 the Project and its potential impacts.

11 23. On December 5, 2019 the La Jolla Community Planning Association held a hearing

12 regarding the Project. During the meeting, community members noted multiple concerns about the

13 Project including, among other things, the Project's parking, handicap requirements, proposed density,

14 impacts on community character, and inconsistency with the Community Plan. Additional concerns

15 were raised about the Project's proposed height and violations of the San Diego Municipal Code.

16 Community members also raised concerns about the Project's impacts to parking, traffic, and safety

17 concerns related to ingress and egress from the Project. In addition, concerns were also raised about

18 the Project's location on the Site and close proximity to the residences to the south of the Site.

19 24. At the December 5, 2019 meeting, the La Jolla Community Planning Association voted 10-

20 3-1 to recommend approval of the Project.

21 25. On February 27, 2020, Petitioners inquired with City staff concerning what analysis of the

22 Project's environmental impacts the City may be conducting. City staff informed Petitioners that the

23 City was relying on environmental documents for the 2016 Approval to approve the Project.

24 26. On February 28, 2020, Petitioners inquired with City staff whether the documents the City

25 staff was relying on were available to the public on the City's website.

26 27. On March 2, 2020, City staff informed Petitioner that they were unaware if copies of the

27 documents City staff was relying on were available on the City's website. City staff informed

28 ///

Moranville v. City of San Diego Writ Petition Page 5

1 Petitioners that Petitioners would have to obtain the documents through a request for public records.

2 Petitioners' November 25, 2019 request for public records sought, among other things, any report or

3 analysis of the Project and its potential impacts; yet, the City did not produce the documents on which

4 City staff relied.

5 28. On March 2, 2020, Petitioners received notice that on February 25, 2020 City staff

6 approved the Project and Coastal Development Permit No. 2356322.

7 29. The City did not issue any Notice of Right to Appeal the Environmental Determination.

8 30. On March 9, 2020, Petitioners filed an appeal to the Planning Commission of the City's

9 February 25, 2020 approvals of the Project including Coastal Development Permit No. 2356322. In
10 their appeal Petitioners raised concerns with the Project's violation of the City's General Plan and the

13. Community Plan. Petitioners objected to the Project's inconsistency with the existing community, its
12 bulk and scale, setbacks, aesthetic and visual impacts, and transitions in scale. Petitioners also raised

13 concerns about the Project's violations of the San Diego Municipal Code including, among other

14 things, provisions concerning Coastal Development Permit requirements, density bonus requirements,

15 and development regulations for the La Jolla Planned District. Petitioners raised concerns about the

16 City's failure to provide adequate notice and information including, among other things, the City's

17 failure to adequately notify the public of the Project's environmental review, and failure to make such

18 information available. Petitioners also raised concerns with the Project's violation of CEQA and the

19 City's failure to adopt adequate findings. Among other things, Petitioners raised concerns that the

20 Project was inconsistent with the development considered by the 2016 Approval and reviewed by

21 Negative Declaration No. 294307. In addition, Petitioners raised concerns about the Project's

22 environmental impacts including hazardous materials and compounds in the soils at the Site, and
23 impacts to transportation, circulation, and parking.

24 31. On March 9, 2020, Petitioners also filed an appeal to City Council of the City's February
25 25, 2020 Environmental Determination for the Project and the City's reliance on Negative Declaration
26 No. 294307 to conduct environmental review for the Project. In their appeal Petitioners raised

27 concerns with the Project's violation of the City's General Plan and the Community Plan. Petitioners

28 objected to the Project's inconsistency with the existing community, its bulk and scale, setbacks,

Moranville v. City of San Diego Page 6
Writ Petition

1 aesthetic and visual impacts, and transitions in scale. Petitioners also raised concerns about the

2 Project's violations of the San Diego Municipal Code including, among other things, provisions

3 concerning Coastal Development Permit requirements, density bonus requirements, and development

4 regulations for the La Jolla Planned District. Petitioners raised concerns about the City's failure to

5 provide adequate notice and information including, among other things, the City's failure to adequately

6 notify the public of the Project's environmental review, and failure to make such information available.

7 Petitioners also raised concerns with the Project's violation of CEQA and the City's failure to adopt

8 adequate findings. Among other things, Petitioners raised concerns that the Project was inconsistent

9 with the development considered by the 2016 Approval and reviewed by Negative Declaration No.

10 294307. In addition, Petitioners raised concerns about the Project's environmental impacts including

11 hazardous materials and compounds in the soils at the Site, and impacts to transportation, circulation,

12 and parking. The City rejected Petitioners' application for the appeal of the City's Environmental

13 Determination claiming the appeal application was "invalid as an environmental determination was not

14 made..."

15 32. On May 6, 2020, Petitioners raised additional concerns about the Project's violation of the

16 Community Plan including the Project's failure to implement Community Plan requirements for

17 surface parking, development design, and community character.

18 33. On May 7, 2020, the Planning Commission held a hearing regarding Petitioners' appeal of

19 the City's February 25, 2020 approval of the Project and CDP. During the May 7, 2020 hearing,

20 Petitioners again raised concerns about the Project's inconsistency with the Community Plan.

21 Additional concerns were raised about the Project's violation of Municipal Code provisions concerning

22 maximum numbers of stories within the La Jolla Planned District.

23 34. At the May 7, 2020 hearing, the Planning Commission voted to deny Petitioners' appeal

24 and uphold the approval for the Project and CDP No. 2356322.

25 35. City staff informed Petitioners that the City did not intend to issue a Notice of

26 Determination following the Planning Commission's Decision.
