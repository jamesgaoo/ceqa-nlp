INTRODUCTION 1

2
1. Petitioner Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis, Inc. ("Petitioner" or
m "SBCRC") challenges the County of Santa Barbara and Board of Supervisors of the County of t Santa Barbara's (collectively "the County" or "Respondents") approval of the Santa Barbara
5 Westcoast Farms, LLC Cannabis Cultivation Project (Project" or "Westcoast Project"), on
cO grounds that it violates the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), California
Planning & Zoning Law, and the California Land Conservation Act (otherwise known as the
"Williamson Act").

2. The Board of Supervisors adopted an ordinance regulating commercial cannabis land
10 uses ("Cannabis Ordinance") in the inland areas of the County, including cultivation,
11 processing, distribution, manufacturing, testing, and sales on February 6, 2018. (Santa Barbara
12 County Land Use and Development Code ("LUDC"') § 35.42.075.) A Program Environmental
13 Impact Report (*PEIR") for the Cannabis Ordinance was prepared in 2017 and certified also on
14 February 6, 2018. At that time, the legal cannabis industry was in its infancy, and the range and
15 severity of environmental impacts resulting from commercial cannabis activities was not well
16 understood. Since the PEIR's certification, County residents and businesses have experienced
17 first-hand just how impactful commercial cannabis cultivation is, and have testified at numerous
18 public hearings identifying specific and substantial evidence documenting changed
19 circumstances, and information of new and substantially more severe impacts than disclosed
20 and analyzed in the PEIR. These impacts include new and substantially increased impacts to
21 agriculture including wine grape production in the Sta. Rita Hills American Viticultural Area
22 ("AVA") where a large concentration of cannabis cultivation projects, including Westcoast, are
23 proposed or already operating.
24
3. As part of its approval of the Westcoast Project, the Board of Supervisors found that the
25 Project was within the scope of the PEIR for the County's Cannabis Ordinance and that its
26 environmental effects were examined in the PEIR. Because the Board was presented with
27 substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that changed circumstances and new
28 information arising after the PEIR's certification may result in new and substantially more

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 1
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Westcoast)

1 severe environmental impacts, the Board's finding was in error and subsequent environmental

2 review is required. (See Sierra Club v. County of Sonoma (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1307.)

3 4. The Board of Supervisors also found that the Project complies with all applicable

4 County's rules and requirements of the Land Use and Development Code and the County's

5 General Plan. The Planning Commission previously found that the Project failed to comply

6 with the County's General Plan, including the Agriculture Element and Santa Ynez Valley
Community Plan (SYVCP). The Board's approval violated state Planning and Zoning law

8 requiring that land use approvals be consistent with the General Plan, and the Board's findings
contained inadequate evidence and analysis to support the approval consistent with State law

10 and the County's LUDC, and failed to reveal the analytic route from evidence to conclusion.

11 5. The County's approval also violated the Williamson Act because it allows cannabis

12 cultivation as the primary agricultural use on a parcel under an Agricultural Preserve Contract,

13 when State law limits Counties to allowing cannabis as a compatible use on Williamson Act

14 contracted land. As a result of this violation, the Project's incompatibility with neighboring

15 agricultural operations under Williamson Act contract was not considered or addressed,

16 compromising the viability of traditional agriculture in the immediate arca, including

17 Petitioner's members' lands and agricultural operations, and undermining the integrity of the

18 County's Agricultural Preserve Program.

19 6. Petitioner brings this Petition for Writ of Mandamus on their own behalf, and on behalf

20 of its members, and on behalf of the general public under California Code of Civil Procedure

21 §1094.5 alleges as follows:

22

23 PARTIES

24
7. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 6 as if fully set forth
25 herein.
26 8. Petitioner Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis, Inc. is a California Public
27 Benefit Corporation whose purposes include protecting the interests of neighborhoods,
28 communities and others affected by the County's inadequate regulation of commercial cannabis

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 2
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Westcoast)

1 activities, upholding the County's General Plan and zoning ordinances and enforcing CEQA
and the Williamson Act when actions adversely affect other land users including residential

3 uses and agriculture. Petitioner, through its members and representatives, participated in the

4 proceedings below, including by providing oral comments to Respondent Board of Supervisors.

5 Petitioner is interested in preserving the integrity of the environment in the County of Santa

6 Barbara including its viewsheds, community character, agricultural viability, and compatibility

7 between land uses. Petitioner possesses beneficial interests in this proceeding, on its own stead

8 and on behalf of its members, that will be adversely affected by the violations of CEQA,

9 Planning & Zoning Law, the Williamson Act and by approval of the Project. Petitioner, as a

10 government watchdog organization, has public interest and taxpayer standing as it seeks
11 enforcement of Respondent's public duty to comply with CEQA, uphold the General Plan, to

12 prevent the illegal and wasteful expenditure of public funds under the Williamson Act, and to

13 prevent nuisance and deleterious impacts to residents and long-established businesses. These

14 claims and the relief sought are broad-based such that the participation of individual members is

15 not required.

16 9. Petitioner's members work, own businesses and reside throughout the County, including

17 in the Sta. Rita Hills AVA. Petitioner's members include individuals and businesses that grow

18 grapes for wine production purposes. The Project is located across Highway 246 and
19 approximately 500 feet east of one member's ranch and winery, and is one of nearly 50
20 cannabis cultivation and processing operations currently proposed or approved in the Santa Rita
21 Valley between Buellton and Lompoc. Petitioner's members and their tenants and employees

22 have medical conditions that increase their susceptibility and physiological reaction to exposure

23 to air pollutants. Terpene and odor neutralizing chemical emissions from the Project have the

24 potential to migrate from the Project and adversely affect the quality and characteristics of

25 wines produced from grapes grown on Petitioner's members' vineyards and elsewhere. One of
26 Petitioner's members appealed the Project's closed door approval by the Planning and

27 Development Department to the Planning Commission, and, following the Planning
28 Commission's denial of the Project and the Applicant's appeal of that denial to the Board of

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 3
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Westcoast)

Supervisors, participated in the proceedings below including by submitting written and oral

2 comments to Respondent Board of Supervisors.. Petitioner's members are beneficially .

3 interested in the outcome of this proceeding.

4 10. Respondent County of Santa Barbara is organized under the laws and Constitution of the

5 State of California. The County is empowered, among other duties, to provide for the orderly

6 planning and management of land use within its borders, including amendment of County land

7 use ordinances, subject to the obligations and limitations of all applicable state, federal and

8 other laws, including CEQA and the Williamson Act. The County is the lead agency under
CEQA. The County is also empowered under the Williamson Act to implement its Agricultural

10 Preserve Program, enrolling land including the Project site in Agricultural Preserve contracts

11 whereby land uses are restricted to agricultural uses over a long period of time in exchange for

12 reduced property tax assessments, and otherwise implementing the Williamson Act's

13 preferential property tax assessments and protections for the long term viability of agriculture.

14 11. Respondent Board of Supervisors of the County of Santa Barbara is the highest

15 governing authority of the County of Santa Barbara, exercising review authority over County

16 land use appeals and controlling, through the Chair of the Board, the conduct of the Board of

17 Supervisors' hearings generally and specifically the hearing which led to the approval of the

18 Project.

19 12. DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, are officers, agents or employees of Respondent Santa

20 Barbara County, or other unknown persons, entities or agencies with an interest in the subject

21 matter of this dispute. The identities and capacities of such DOES are unknown to Petitioner at

22 this time. Petitioner will seek leave to amend this Petition to identify the true name and

23 capacity of each such person when identified.

24 13. Real Party in Interest Santa Barbara Westcoast Farms, LLC is a California Limited

25 Liability Company, and applicant for the Santa Barbara Westcoast Farms, LLC Cannabis

26 Cultivation Project. Scott Rudolph, Santa Barbara Westcoast Farms LLC's principal and

27 managing member, is also named as a Real Party in Interest because he is listed as Project

28 Applicant on the Notice of Determination.

5 when identified.

6

STANDING

15. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully set forth

herein.

10 16. Approval of the Project will adversely affect the interests of Petitioner SBCRC and

11 SBCRC's members and supporters. SBCRC's members and supporters reside, visit, operate

12 businesses, and own property in the area affected by the Project, including agricultural land
13 subject to Agricultural Preserve contracts pursuant to the Williamson Act and in production

14 with traditional crops including wine grapes, and would be adversely impacted by the Project.

15 Petitioner's members own lands in the proximity of the Project site, where wine grapes have
16 been cultivated for over a decade and winemaking, processing and outdoor public wine tasting

17 activities are conducted onsite. Petitioner's members, supporters and representatives, and other

18 members of the public, have submitted comments on and objections to the lack of CEQA

19 compliance, violations of the County's General Plan, the LUDC, and Williamson Act, and have

20 participated at public hearings before the Board of Supervisors and Planning Commission.

21 Petitioner pays taxes in Santa Barbara County and is a taxpayer under CCP § 526a.

22 Accordingly, Petitioner, including members and supporters of SBCRC, are "aggrieved persons"

23 within the meaning of Public Resources Code Section 21177.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

9 20. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 19 as if fully set forth
10 herein.

11 21. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to the California Constitution, Article
12 VI, Section 10, because this case is not a cause given by statute to other trial courts.
13 Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section
14 1094.5; California Public Resources Code Section 21167; CEQA Guidelines Section 15112;
15 and applicable law.
16 22. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure §$393, 394 because
17 Petitioner SBCRC, through its principal place of business and through the residences and
18 business operations of its members, directors, and officers, and Respondents' principal place of
19 business and County seat are located within the Southern portion of the County of Santa
20 Barbara.
21 23. This Court has jurisdiction over the County of Santa Barbara and the Board of
22 Supervisors of the County of Santa Barbara because the County is an agency established by the
23 legislature of the State of California with its principal place of business located in the City and
24 County of Santa Barbara.
25 24. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless
26 this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their
27 approval of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, the County's approval will remain in
28 effect in violation of state law.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 6
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Westcoast)

STATEMENT OF FACTS

2
25. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 24 as if fully set forth
3 herein.

26. The State of California established the first statewide regulatory system for medical
cannabis businesses, the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act (MMRSA), in
4D September 2015. The County adopted Article X, Medical Marijuana Regulations, on January
19, 2016 which established that then-existing medical marijuana cultivations operations that
were legal under California law were legal nonconforming uses. In November 2016, California
voters approved Proposition 64 for the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (AUMA), which legalized
10 adult personal non-medical use and cultivation of cannabis under a strict system of control and
11 authorized additional local requirements. The California Legislature then passed the Medicinal
12 and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA), a hybrid regulatory structure
13 for both medical and recreational cannabis activities.
14
27. The County of Santa Barbara advanced and ultimately approved ? package of ordinance
15 amendments including amendments to the County's LUDC regulating commercial cannabis
16 operations in the inland areas of the County ("Cannabis Ordinance"). The Cannabis Ordinance
17 amendments included: regulations that specify how and where, by zone, cannabis activities may
18 occur; general development standards that would apply to all commercial cannabis activities
19 and specific development standards would also apply to allowed commercial cannabis
20 cultivation, manufacturing, and microbusinesses: and new regulations governing cannabis
21 activities, including cultivation, manufacturing, distribution, testing, and retail sales.
22
28. The County prepared a Program Environmental Impact Report ("PEIR") for the Cannabis
23 Ordinance, which the Board of Supervisors certified on February 6, 2018. The PEIR identifies
24 12 significant and unavoidable adverse "Class I" environmental impacts associated with
25 implementation of the Cannabis Ordinance for which the Board of Supervisors approved a
26 Statement of Overriding Considerations, including the finding of specific significant impacts in
27 the areas of agricultural resources, air quality and greenhouse gases, noise, and transportation.
28 Although the PEIR concluded that most of the significant impacts identified in the PEIR were

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 7
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Westcoast)

1 unavoidable and could not be mitigated, several mitigation measures were identified.

2 Mitigation measures proposed to address, but not eliminate these Class I impacts largely consist

3 of conditions that would apply to individual cannabis permits to reduce the impact "to the extenti

4 feasible".

5 29. When the PEIR was certified, the County's Uniform Rules for Agricultural Preserves and

6 Farmland Security Zones (referred to as "Uniform Rules") did not allow cannabis activities on

7 parcels subject to an Agricultural Preserve contract. While the PEIR assumed that the Uniform

8 Rules would be amended to allow cannabis activities in some form, the PEIR's analysis was

9 based on the options being considered at the time, all of which assumed that cannabis would be

10 considered a "compatible" use and not a use that qualifies as commercial production of an

11 agricultural commodity. The PEIR's analysis relied on the expectation on this classification of

12 cannabis cultivation as a "compatible use" that would trigger the County's Agricultural Preserve

13 Advisory Committee ("APAC')' review of cannabis applications to ensure their compatibility

14 with adjacent agricultural crops, and expressly relied on this compatibility review to address

15 potentially significant impacts to agriculture. At the February 6, 2018 hearing in which the

16 Board certified the PEIR and adopted the Cannabis Ordinance, County staff presented a

17 summary of the Cannabis Ordinance amendments and related amendments in a Board Letter.

18 That same Board Letter included a detailed list of APAC's recommendations for Uniform Rules

19 amendments regarding cannabis. The Board Letter identified the following in a list of the

20 proposed amendments to the Uniform Rules from APAC: "Specify that cannabis cultivation and

21 ancillary facilities in support of cannabis cultivation are compatible uses on contracted land."

22 As Attachment 5, County staff also included : draft resolution to exclude cannabis cultivation

23

24

25

26 The County's Agricultural Preserve Advisory Committee ("APAC") is responsible for administering the County's Agricultural Preserve Program and the Uniform Rules. Its duties include reviewing applications and making
27 recommendations for creating agricultural preserves, entering new contracts, making revisions to existing preserves contracts, termination of contracts and disestablishing preserves. In conjunction with these duties, the APAC is
28 responsible for monitoring and enforcement of the Agricultural Preserve Program, including by conducting the foregoing compatibility review for proposed projects where the proposed use is deemed "compatible" under the Uniform Rules.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 8
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Westcoast)

1 from the Uniform Rules' definition of "agricultural use" and "agricultural commodity", per

2 APAC's recommendation after numerous public hearings on the topic.

3 30. On March 20, 2018, the County Board of Supervisors amended the County's Uniform
Rules to allow cannabis activities on Williamson Act contracted lands and define cannabis

5 cultivation as commercial production of an agricultural commodity on lands subject to

6 Agricultural Preserve contracts. The Board's decision to amend the Uniform Rules to define

7 cannabis cultivation as commercial production of an agricultural commodity on lands subject to

8 Agricultural Preserve contracts was at odds with the recommendation of the APAC, defied the

9 recommendation of County staff that cannabis be considered a "compatible" use, conflicted

10 with the Board Letter and then-proposed draft Uniform Rules amendments presented in the

11 February 6, 2018 hearing during which the PEIR was certified, and was not analyzed in the

12 PEIR, as expressly stated by County staff at the March 2018 hearing. The Board's March 2018
13 decision to define cannabis as commercial production of an agricultural commodity on

14 Williamson Act contracted lands conflicted with and eviscerated the PEIR's reliance on APAC

15 review to ensure cannabis' compatibility with non-cannabis agricultural uses on the parcel, and
16 eliminated the process of APAC review that was relied on in the PEIR to separately ensure that

17 cannabis activities would not conflict with other adjacent and nearby properties and farming

18 operations subject to Williamson Act contracts. At the time the PEIR was certified, APAC's

19 recommendation was to classify cannabis as a "compatible use" and allow cannabis cultivation
20 within or outside the designated development envelope of a premises, but the land dedicated to

21 cannabis cultivation outside of the development envelope could not exceed 5% of the premises
22 or 5 acres, whichever is less. The PEIR's analysis of the Cannabis Ordinance impacts on

23 Williamson Act contracted land also assumed the Uniform Rules would be amended to allow

24 certain cannabis activities as "compatible uses" on lands that are subject Agricultural Preserve

25 contracts, but that cannabis cultivation would not be subject to acreage limitations, provided
26 that the property owner complies with the minimum cultivation of non-cannabis crops and/or

27 grazing requirements of the Uniform Rules. The only alternative analysis in the PEIR is

28 "Alternative 2 - Preclusion of Cannabis Activities from Williamson Act Land Alternative",

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 9
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Westcoast)

1 which (like APAC's recommendation and the PEIR's project analysis) also analyzed a scenario

2 where cannabis is classified as a "compatible use", but the canopy is limited to one outdoor is

3 cannabis cultivation license of 22,000 square feet from the California Department of Food &

4 Agriculture. Both the PEIR's Proposed Project Description and Alternative 2 assumed cannabis

5 would be treated as a "compatible use" by the Uniform Rules.

6 31. The Project site is a 73-acre agriculturally zoned parcel located on Highway 246, west of
the City of Buellton. The property has historically been farmed, and is subject to Williamson

8 Act Agricultural Preserve Contract No. 69AP055. The property is bounded by Highway 246 to

9 the north, a 39-acre agricultural property to the west, a 233-acre agricultural property to the

10 south and a 30-acre agricultural property to the east. These surrounding agricultural properties

11 are also under Williamson Act contracts.

12 32. An Existing Developed Residential Neighborhood ("EDRN") is located approximately

13 0.87 miles from the Project site. The Project site is located within the boundaries of the Santa

14 Ynez Valley Community Plan ("SYVCP") area and is therefore subject to the goals and policies

15 of this Community Plan. The SYVCP identifies the Highway 246 corridor and the "inner-rural

16 region to the west of the City of Buellton", which includes the Project site, as meriting special

17 consideration and heightened review to ensure that development is compatible with the existing

18 setting and does not detract from the rural aesthetic of the Santa Ynez Valley. As the

19 westernmost parcel in the SYVCP along Highway 246, the Project is the "Gateway" parcel for

20 eastbound travelers on Highway 246 as they enter the visually-sensitive Community Plan area.
21 33. In addition to the Project, currently, there are nineteen (19) pending outdoor cannabis

22 cultivation projects in the Santa Rita Valley area that are pending approval or that have been
23 approved (and appealed), averaging 30 acres each, totaling approximately 605 acres. For

24 context, Sonoma County has capped cannabis cultivation at 1 acre per parcel, with 88 growers

25 currently operating, totaling 88 acres countywide. These nineteen projects total 605 acres of

26 outdoor cannabis cultivation, or 39% of Santa Barbara County's 1,575 acres cannabis

27 production cap. Cannabis cultivation projects proposed in the Santa Rita area represent 55% of

28 the total 1,100 acres of cannabis estimated as needed to supply the demand of the entire State of

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 10. Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Westcoast)

1 California. Due to its status under federal law, interstate transportation and sale of cannabis is

2 prohibited.

3 34. On February 15, 2019 Santa Barbara Westcoast Farms, LLC submitted an application

4 requesting a County Land Use Permit ("LUP") to allow approximately 50 acres of outdoor

5 cannabis cultivation (45-acres of outdoor cannabis cultivation, 5-acre outdoor nursery), and two

6 3,000 square foot agricultural accessary structures for processing activities. Over the course of

7 the County's review and during and between hearings of the Planning Commission and Board

8 of Supervisors, the Project Description changed in material ways, increasing the number of area
lights, increasing the number of employees, revising processing and adjusting back and forth the

10 acreage of the cultivation areas. This unstable Project Description impaired the public's ability

11 to understand the Project and its impacts.

12 35. On March 15, 2019, APAC reviewed the proposed project and the Williamson Act
13 contract for consistency with the Uniform Rules. On April 19, 2019 APAC completed its
14 review and voted 3-0 to find the project consistent with Uniform Rule 2-2.1 D. Despite
15 comment from counsel regarding the Project's potential adverse impacts to and incompatibility

16 with adjacent agricultural uses (including odor impacts to tasting rooms, and vineyard crops),

17 APAC did not evaluate the proposed cultivation under the principles of compatibility as

18 envisioned by and relied on in the PEIR as the sole means by which the County would ensure

19 cannabis cultivation does not impact adjacent agricultural uses.

20 36. The County Planning and Development Director approved the LUP application (Case No.
21 19LUP-00000-00064) on April 26, 2019. On May 6, 2019 - ten days after the LUP was

22 approved - Planning and Development staff prepared the State CEQA Guidelines Section

23 15168(c)(4) Checklist for Commercial Cannabis Land Use Entitlement and Licensing

24 Applications, and determined that all of the environmental impacts of Westcoast's proposed
25 cannabis operation would be within the scope of the PEIR.

26 37. One of Petitioner's members timely appealed the Director's approval of 19LUP-00000-

27 00064 to the Planning Commission. Hearings were held on August 8, 2019, November 6, 2019
28 and December 4, 2019. Over the course of these hearings, the Planning Commission considered

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 11
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Westcoast)

evidence in the record, statements given by the Appellant and the Applicant, and public

2 testimony with regard to the proposed project. The Planning Commission denied the project

3 based on findings for denial that were adopted at the December 4, 2019 hearing. The Planning

4 Commission's denial findings included determinations that the Project did not conform to the

5 applicable provisions of the County's Comprehensive Plan, including the Agricultural Element,

6 SYVCP, and LUDC concerning visual and aesthetic resources, incompatibility with adjacent

7 agricultural operations, inadequate odor control, and inconsistency with the intent of the AG-II-

8 100 zone district, and accordingly, concluded that the necessary findings for approval of the

9 LUP application could not be made. Notably the Planning Commission found that the Project

10 could result in the cessation of agricultural operations on neighboring properties, and create

11 significant unmitigable malodors that could constitute a continuous public nuisance.

12 38. Both in its appeal to the Planning Commission and in its opposition to the Applicant's

13 appeal, Petitioner and its members raised and presented substantial evidence supporting

14 arguments that Project approval would violate CEQA and the Williamson Act, and challenging

15 the adequacy of LUP approval findings based on inconsistencies with the County's LUDC and

16 Comprehensive Plan including the Agricultural Element and SYVCP visual resource

17 protections, agricultural compatibility and odors.

18 39. The Board of Supervisors heard the Applicant's appeal of the Planning Commission's

19 denial on April 21, 2020. County Staff articulated two options for the Board, to deny the appeal

20 and deny the Project or uphold the appeal and grant de novo approval of a revised project (the

21 Applicant revised the Project Description after the Planning Commission's denial to, among

22 other things, increase the area of outdoor cannabis cultivation, and decrease the nursery area and

23 proposed lighting). After hearing from representatives for the Applicant, and from numerous

24 concerned members of the public including Petitioner and Petitioner's members, and taking

25 direction from County staff and referencing guidance from County Counsel in considering but

26 rejecting a smaller project deemed feasible by the applicant at the hearing that would have had

27 less impacts and present less severe land use incompatibilities, the Board voted 3-2 to uphold

28 the appeal and approved the revised Project.

1 40. Respondents have abused their discretion and have failed to comply with the law in the

2 following ways:

3

4 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (Violations of CEQA: Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000, et seq.)

6 41. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 40 as if fully set forth

7 herein.

3 42. Respondents abused their discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by CEQA

9 by approving the Westcoast Cannabis Cultivation Project relying on the PEIR for the County's

10 Cannabis Ordinance, when subsequent environmental review pursuant to Public Resources

11 Code section 21166 and section 21094 is required.

12 43. After a Program EIR has been prepared, subsequent activities in the program like this

13 Project must be examined in light of the Program EIR to determine whether additional

14 environmental review is necessary. (Pub. Res. Code § 21094; CEQA Guidelines? § 15168 (c).)

15 If the Project would have effects that were not examined in the PEIR, a new Initial Study would
16 need to be prepared specifically for this Project, leading to either an EIR or a Negative

17 Declaration. (Id.).

18 44. Subsequent environmental review is required where "substantial changes occur with

19 respect to the circumstances under which the project is undertaken, which will require major

20 revisions of the previous EIR due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects

21 or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects." (CEQA

22 Guidelines 15162 (a)(1-2); Pub. Res. Code § 21166 (a-b).) Subsequent environmental review
23 is also required if new information of substantial importance, which was not known and could

24 not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the previous EIR was
25 certified (here the PEIR on February 6, 2018), shows that: a) the project will have one or more

26 significant effects not discussed in the previous EIR or negative declaration; b) significant

27

28

2 14 CCR 15000 et seq.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 13
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Westcoast)

1 effects previously examined will be substantially more severe than shown in the previous EIR;

2 c) mitigation measures or alternatives previously found not to be feasible would in fact be

3 feasible, and would substantially reduce one or more significant effects of the project, but the

4 project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative; or d) mitigation

5 measures or alternatives which are considerably different from those analyzed in the previous

6 EIR would substantially reduce one or more significant effects on the environment, but the

7 project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative. (CEQA Guidelines

8 15162 (a)(3); Pub. Res. Code § 21166 (c).)

9 45. An agency's determination regarding whether a subsequent activity is covered by a

10 Program EIR is subject to the "fair argument" test. Specifically, "if there is substantial evidence

11 in the record that the later project may arguably have a significant adverse effect on the

12 environment which was not examined in the prior program EIR, doubts must be resolved in

13 favor of environmental review and the agency must prepare a new tiered EIR, notwithstanding

14 the existence of contrary evidence."(Sierra Club v. County of Sonoma (1992) 6 Cal.App.4th

15 1307, 1319.)

16 46. In written and oral testimony before the Planning Commission and the Board of

17 Supervisors, Petitioner and others presented substantial evidence of new and substantially

18 increased significant environmental effects, resulting from post-PEIR certification changes to

19 the County's Uniform Rules for Agricultural Preserves, and new information regarding

20 pesticide migration, terpene taint, the effect of odor on tasting rooms and the cumulative effect

21 of concentrated cannabis cultivation in the Project area including to the agricultural and

22 economic viability of the wine industry within the Sta. Rita Hills AVA. Under these

23 circumstances, CEQA requires project-specific environmental review prior to the Board's

24 approval of the Project.

25 Lack of Williamson Act Compatibility Analysis

26 47. To address potential adverse effects of incompatibility between cannabis and adjacent

27 agricultural crops, the PEIR relied on APAC review under the Uniform Rules to ensure

28 compatibility with agricultural uses, and to ensure that "cannabis activities would not conflict

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 14 Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Westcoast)

1 with properties that are subject to Williamson Act contract." Subsequent revisions to the

2 Uniform Rules after PEIR certification classified cannabis cultivation as commercial production

3 of an agricultural commodity, eliminating the compatibility review relied on in the PEIR to

4 protect neighboring agricultural operations and to mitigate significant impacts to agriculture

5 resulting from conflicts with existing zoning for agricultural use, Agricultural Preserve contracts

6 pursuant to the Williamson Act, or the conversion of farmland to non-agricultural use. The

7 provision for APAC compatibility review is the only means identified in the PEIR that purports

8 to address conflicts between neighboring agricultural operations including the effects of

9 pesticide migration from legacy farming operations onto cannabis, which has a zero tolerance

10 for pesticides, including most pesticides approved for organic use. The PEIR did not anticipate,
11 and thus evaluate in its principal analysis or Alternative 2, the impacts if cannabis would be
12 defined as commercial production of an agricultural commodity and thus included in the
13 minimum production requirements in the Uniform Rules for commercial production of

14 "agricultural commodities." The PEIR could not and did not analyze the impacts of this new

15 classification either to existing agriculture generally or to Williamson Act contracted lands
16 specifically. Lastly, the PEIR could not and did not analyze the effect of the changed definition

17 on the County's ability to mitigate the impacts of individual cannabis cultivation projects. In
18 short, the Uniform Rules revisions eliminated a critical procedural and substantive element of
19 ensuring compatibility between cannabis cultivation projects and adjacent conventional
20 agricultural uses, rendering that portion of the PEIR and Alternative 2 moot, and thus
21 unavailable to serve as permit-level environmental review for this issue.

22 48. Due to this change in circumstances, Westcoast's proposed cannabis cultivation was not

23 reviewed by APAC for compatibility with the Agricultural Preserve contracts held by adjacent
24 landowners (many contracts in place for 50+ years) including properties to the North of the
25 Project site (70AP006, 69A1055 and 69AP056), and adjacent properties south of the Project site
26 (83AP013 and 03AP027). The introduction of vapor-phase odor abatement plan reagents,
27 which are intended to neutralize cannabis odors but can also affect the smell and taste of

28 agricultural crops exposed to the vapors, was not addressed.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 15
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Westcoast)

49. Substantial evidence of new and substantially increased impacts to agriculture resulting

2 from the post-PEIR certification Uniform Rules amendment was presented to County

3 decisionmakers. This substantial evidence includes testimony of the Grower-Shipper
Association of Santa Barbara-San Luis Obispo Counties regarding conflicts with neighboring

5 agricultural properties under Agricultural Preserve, including a documented conflict that

6 occurred between another nearby cannabis cultivator and adjacent agricultural operation (one of

7 the Grower Shipper Association members) regarding pesticide application (discussed further

8 below). Further, the California Farm Bureau Federation provided testimony to APAC on

9 February 7, 2020 and the County confirming January 1, 2020 amendments to the Williamson

10 Act are declaratory statements of the State's rejection of cannabis as an "agricultural
11 commodity." The Planning Commission's findings that the project has the potential to conflict

12 with agricultural operations on neighboring properties, based on facts and their expertise,

13 constitutes additional substantial evidence.

14 New Information on Pesticide Migration

15 50. New information of substantial importance, which was not known and could not have

16 been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the PEIR was certified, has

17 become available showing that the Project will have substantially increased impacts to

18 agriculture as a consequence of pesticide migration. Specifically, the occurrence of migration

19 of pesticide waft that can occur after lawful applications of pesticides, in conjunction with the

20 prohibition on pesticides or insecticides in cannabis, including most commonly used
21 organically-certified pesticides, will likely result in the conversion of farmland to non-

22 agricultural uses when conventional agriculture becomes impossible or uneconomical.

23 51. After the PEIR's certification, substantial evidence has come forward showing that

24 commercial, third-party pesticide applicators (used for decades and necessary for much of the

25 County's economically productive avocado, grape and citrus production) have refused to apply

26 materials to either conventional or organic avocado and citrus crops due to incompatibility with

27 nearby cannabis cultivation operations. Thresholds for cannabis are as little as one microgram

28 per gram, or 0.1 part per million. Other farmers in Santa Barbara County, in at least two

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 16
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Westcoast)

1 instances, have lost crops after switching to other less effective pest management products to

2 reduce potential liability from the legal application of pesticides after threats of legal action by

3 cannabis operators. The conflict has manifested already between a cannabis cultivation

4 operation in the Project's immediate vicinity and one of its farming neighbors, who had their

5 pest control applicator threatened for using materials essential to their agricultural production.

6 Furthermore, the County received testimony of the now-known severity of this impact from the

7 Grower-Shipper Association (reporting the experience of their members reflecting cannabis'

8 incompatibility with organic and conventional Central Coast agriculture) and Santa Barbara

9 County Agricultural Advisory Committee ("AAC", asking for delay in Board action pending

10 ordinance revisions and if not, imposition of additional Project conditions "to address

11 predictable conflicts that have arisen in many situations in the County"). New evidence was

12 presented that conventional farms nearby existing and proposed cannabis cultivation sites are

13 unable to produce economically viable crops due to cannabis cultivators' threats, which have

14 chilled pest control applicators from providing pest control services to sites near cannabis

15 cultivations. The project will cause these farms to cease production and potentially go out of

16 business, creating blight and facilitating the collapse of the wine industry and food production in

17 the vicinity of the Project and elsewhere in Santa Barbara County, with secondary impacts to

18 hospitality facilities in wine country. The Planning Commission's findings, based on facts and

19 their expertise, constitutes additional substantial evidence that the potential for pesticide

20 migration may significantly impact the long-term viability of agriculture in the Project area.

21 New Information on Terpene Taint and Odor Neutralizing Chemicals

22 52. New information of substantial importance, which was not known and could not have

23 been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the PEIR was certified, has
24 become available showing that the Project will have substantially increased impacts to

25 agriculture from terpene taint. Terpene taint results when concentrated airborne terpenes

26 released by cannabis plants in low wind conditions and during inversions (that are common in

27 the Project vicinity) are transported to and absorbed by nearby grapes on the vine. This taint is

28 conveyed to wine produced from these grapes, creating imperfections and different flavors in

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 17
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Westcoast)

1 wines that are meticulously produced to present the subtle terroir of the soils and land where the

2 grapes are raised. The threat of taint impugns the reputation of wines, wineries, and entire

3 appellations, including the coveted Sta. Rita Hills AVA, where delicate and refined flavor

4 profiles are adversely affected by even subtle changes in flavor. A number of Santa Barbara

5 vintners have delayed plans for constructing new visitor-serving wine tasting facilities and

6 wineries because of the threat that Santa Barbara County wines will be labelled as inferior

7 within the premium wine market due to terpene taint, and due to concerns that widespread odors

8 from the Project and other cannabis projects will conflict with wine tasting, which is 80%

9 olfactory. The Project's Byers odor ontrol system will introduce fragrances in the vicinity of

10 tasting rooms and wine grapes. Wine tasting is an important element of fiscal viability for

11 smaller premium wineries where direct sales to consumer, typically after tasting, are crucial to

12 winery profitability. The secondary economic inputs of wine tasting and wine-related events in

13 the Santa Y nez Valley is substantial, and terpene taint threatens to undermine or eliminate

14 significant portions of the local economy that are founded on the success of the wine industry,

15 with potentially significant impacts from the abandonment and conversion of idled lands, loss of

16 agricultural services and infrastructure making agriculture more expensive, difficult and

17 unprofitable, ultimately causing significant losses of open and productive agricultural lands.

18 53. The potential for cannabis terpenes and odor neutralizing chemicals to impact wine

19 grapes was not an identifiable issue at the time the PEIR was certified. In 2019, Food and Wine

20 magazine reported that an Oregon vineyard has been allowed to move forward with a lawsuit

21 against a nearby marijuana business, claiming their operation caused at least one customer to
22 fear their grapes would have unwanted notes of cannabis. Since then, experts including Dr.

23 Anita Oberholster of the Department of Viticulture and Enology at UC Davis, Dr. William

24 Vizuete of Pacific Environmental Analytics, LLC, and others have testified and presented

25 evidence to the County of terpene taint in comparable situations.

26 54. While research necessary to thoroughly understand this impact is presently underway,

27 there is substantial evidence in the record that wine quality can be affected by exposure to

28 airborne terpenes from cannabis cultivation, including the fact-based expert opinion of Dr.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 18
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Westcoast)

1 Oberholster, peer reviewed scientific studies and testing results in Santa Barbara County, each

2 of which establish that terpene migration from cannabis is occurring and that terpenes can causel

3 wine taint. This substantial evidence supports a fair argument that the Project may result in

4 terpene taint to nearby wine grapes, leading to a significant incompatibility between these two

5 land uses. Evidence of this impact is far from speculation, and is being taken seriously by the

6 Agricultural Commissioner, who is currently investigating funding sources for, and researchers

7 who are qualified to conduct, a study to further address wine grape absorption and taint from

8 cannabis terpenes. Additionally, Petitioner and the public submitted chemical testing results as

9 evidence of terpene taint of wine from cannabis terpene migration at a comparable vineyard in

10 Santa Barbara County. Further, a letter submitted by the County's appointed Agricultural

11 Advisory Committee urges the Board of Supervisors to continue the appeal of the Westcoast

12 Project specifically until the Planning Commission and Board resolves amendments to the

13 Cannabis Ordinance, including amendments intended to address this very issue of terpene taint.

14 These expert and industry opinions constitute substantial evidence supporting a fair argument of
15 potentially significant impact that necessitates project-specific environmental review.

16 Il Cumulative Impacts

17 55. The PEIR does not analyze or examine the severity of the cumulative impact of the

18 proliferation of cannabis cultivation projects in AG-II zones between Buellton and Lompoc
19 along Highway 246, a scenic corridor that is considered the gateway to the Santa Ynez Valley.

20 The PEIR does not analyze the severity of the cumulative effect of the Project and other
21 proposed and approved cannabis cultivation projects on the wineries and tasting rooms in the

22 Sta. Rita Hills AVA. Further, the majority of the land in the Sta. Rita Hills AVA and other

23 areas where cannabis projects are proposed are subject to Williamson Act contracts, implicating

24 cumulative CEQA issues discussed previously with regard to the Uniform Rules and conflicts
25 with State law, discussed below. Specifically, the PEIR failed to identify or examine the
26 potential cumulative impact to agriculture including from agricultural incompatibility, pesticide

27 migration, terpene taint, or odor-based preclusion of wine tasting associated with this intensity

28 of cannabis cultivation in this important wine producing region. Similarly the CEQA Checklist

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 19
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Westcoast)

for the Project does not examine these potentially significant cumulative impacts. Discussed

2 above, new information revealed substantial evidence of these impacts. Additionally, the

3 Planning Commission's findings, including that "the proposed project, in conjunction with

4 nearby cannabis operations, would result in significant malodors that would not be mitigable by

5 the proposed OAP [Odor Abatement Plan]" constitutes additional substantial evidence of a
significant cumulative impact. Accordingly additional environmental review is required.

56. For all the above reasons, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion and failed to

8 proceed in accordance with CEQA.

10 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (Violations of State Planning and Zoning Laws: Gov. Code § 65000, et seq.)

12 57. Petitioner hereby re-alleges and incorporates the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1

13 through 56, inclusive.

14 Inconsistency with the General Plan Including Santa Ynez Valley Community Plan

15 Policies

16 58. Government Code section 65300 requires the legislative body of each county to adopt a

17 general plan for the physical development of the unincorporated areas of the county. The
18 general plan serves as a charter for future development to which all other land use decisions

19 must conform. Land use decisions must also be consistent with the general plan. (Resource
20 Defense Fund v. County of Santa Cruz (1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 800, 806; Neighborhood Action

21 Group v. County of Calaveras (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 1176, 1182-86.) The County's General

22 Plan is referred to as the "Comprehensive Plan" and includes a number of issue-specific

23 elements, such as the Agricultural Element, as well as the Santa Ynez Valley Community Plan
24 which applies to the Project area. In order to approve a Land Use Permit, the County
25 decisionmaker must specifically find that the Project conforms to the applicable provisions of

26 the Comprehensive Plan including any applicable community or arca plan. (LUDC §

27 35.82.110.a.l.)

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 20
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis County of Santa Barbara (Westcoast)

1 59. The Westcoast Cannabis Cultivation Project fails to conform to several applicable

2 provisions of the Comprehensive Plan and Santa Ynez Valley Community Plan (SYVCP), as

3 follows:

4 a. SYVCP Visual Resource Protections. The SYVCP identifies areas for special

5 consideration and heightened review to ensure that development is compatible

6 with the existing setting and does not detract from the rural aesthetic of the Valley

7 including the Highway 246 corridor and the "inner-rural region to the west of the

8 City of Buellton", which includes the Project site. To ensure special protection of

9 these aesthetic resources, including this inner-rural region, there is a Design

10 Control Overlay applied to certain sections of the planning area, including the
11 Project site. The intent of the Design Control Overlay is to "foster well designed
12 and sited developments that protect scenic qualities, property values, and

13 neighborhood character." The County relies on the various Boards of

14 Architectural Review to ensure consistency with the Design Control Overlay's

15 goals, policies, and standards, nevertheless Respondents approved the Project

16 before even Preliminary Design Approval has been granted by the Board of

17 Architectural Review, and redesigns are ongoing. The Project is located directly

18 on Highway 246, an identified scenic roadway, and thus the various elements of
19 the Project (i.e. fencing, landscaping, and lighting) are also located along

20 Highway 246. This results in impacts to this scenic corridor and merits heightened

21 design consideration by the County. The Planning Commission determined that

22 the project's landscaping, in conjunction with adjacent operations with similar

23 landscape plans, would establish a nearly 5,000-foot long continuous vegetation

24 screen along the south side of Highway 246. The Planning Commission found

25 that the project would obstruct views of scenic areas and, as a result, the proposed |

26 project would alter the character of the agricultural expanse along Highway 246

27 located near the western gateway to the Santa Ynez Valley. Moreover, one-time

28 vegetative screening is not effective or generally accepted to permanently mitigate

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 21
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Westcoast)

2 visual impacts to sensitive visual environments, therefore any reliance on

4 vegetative screening must include a duty to maintain such screening for So long as
the Project is operational, supported by a performance bond, which is not a part of

5 the Project or its conditions. Due to these features the Project fails to conform to

6 applicable provisions protecting visual resources in the SYVCP plan area,
including the following:

7

8 i. SYVCP Goal VIS-SYV-1: Protect the Rural/Agricultural Character and
Natural Features of the Planning Area, Including Mountain Views, Scenic
Corridors and Buffers, Prominent Valley Viewsheds, and the Quality of
the Nighttime Sky.

10

11 ii. Policy VIS-SYV-1: Development of property should minimize impacts to open space views as seen from public roads and viewpoints and avoid

12 destruction of significant visual resources.

13 ili. DevStd VIS-SYV-1.1: Development and grading shall be sited and

14 designed to avoid or minimize scarring of the landscape and minimize the bulk of structures visible from public viewing areas. Mitigation measures

15 may be required, including but not limited to increased setbacks, reduced

16 structure size and height, reductions in grading, extensive landscaping and proper siting of driveways, unless those measures would preclude

17 reasonable use of the property or pose adverse public safety issues.

18 iv. DevStd VIS-SYV-1.9: The design of future discretionary development

19 shall, at minimum, include the components listed below. The project's
architectural guidelines shall be included as notes on the project plans.

20 Roofing and Feature Color and Material. Development shall include

21 darker, earth tone colors on structure roofing and other onsite features lessen potential visual contrast between the structures and the natural o

22 visual backdrop of the area, as applicable. Natural-appearing building

23 materials and colors compatible with surrounding terrain (earth tones
and non-reflective paints) shall be used on exterior surfaces of all

24 structures, including fences.

25 Compatibility with Adjacent Uses. The design, scale, and character of the

26 project architecture shall be compatible with the scale of existing
development adjacent to the site, as applicable.

27 V.

28 DevStd LUA-SYV-3.1: New non-agricultural development adjacent to
agriculturally zoned property shall include appropriate buffers, such as trees, shrubs, walls, and fences, to protect adjacent agricultural operations from potential conflicts and claims of nuisance. The size and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 22
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Westcoast)

1 character of the buffers shall be determined through parcel-specific

2 review on a case-by-case basis.

3 b. SYVCP Flood Protections. Most of the Project is located within the SYVCP's

4 designated Flood Hazard Area, and development, including the parking arca and

5 well facilities are at risk. SYVCP DevStd FLD-SYV-1.1 prohibits development

6 in floodplains, including designated flood Hazard Areas, unless certain findings of

7 necessity are made. No such findings are included nor is there publicly available

8 evidence that a flood control analysis was performed. The need for this policy

9 and findings on this particular site are evident upon review of the impacts of the

10 1969 floods, during which a majority of the site was swept clean and debris that

11 was carried downstream forced the emergency demolition of a bridge to avoid

12 further flood risk to Lompoc.

13 c. Environmental Resource Management Element. The Environmental Resource

14 Management Element (ERME) identifies "Drum Canyon Road: Los Alamos-

15 Lompoc-Buellton link" as a scenic corridor where development should be subject

16 to project plan review and imposition of specific conditions to preserve the

17 integrity of the land and environment. The Project's mandatory traffic routing

18 map identifies Drum Canyon Road as primary route for Project traffic. The

19 effect of a large volume of Project traffic and its aesthetic and visual impacts were

20 not reviewed by the County in light of it being located in a scenic corridor

21 pursuant to the ERME.

22 d. Comprehensive Plan Agricultural Element. The Agricultural Element provides as

23 its first goal:

24 i "Santa Barbara County shall assure and enhance the continuation of
agriculture as a major viable production industry in Santa Barbara 25 Country. Agriculture shall be encouraged. Where conditions allow,

26 (taking into account environmental impacts) expansion and intensification shall be supported."
27

28 The Project's impacts on adjacent agriculture (for the reasons discussed above)
clearly conflict with the primary goal of the County's Agricultural Element to

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 23 Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Westcoast)

ensure the viability of agriculture in the County. The effect of these conflicts will
be to undermine the viability of the wine industry as a production industry in
Santa Barbara County. Wine grapes can require a decade or more before they
reach optimal production, representing a considerable and long term investment
that is jeopardized, individually and throughout the region, by the careless

6 introduction of cannabis cultivation on sites adjacent to wine grape production.
60. The Board's finding required by LUDC § 35.82.110.a.1. that the Project conforms to the
applicable provisions of the Comprehensive Plan including any applicable community or area
plan is not supported by substantial evidence in the record. The Board's findings are not

10 supported by substantial evidence in the record, and fail to reveal the analytic route from

11 evidence to conclusions. In addition the reasons articulated above, the evidence relied on is

12 insufficient as to the Project's consistency with visual resource protections is inadequate

13 because the standard mitigation measures for the visual and aesthetic impacts of the Project are

14 inadequate in this special area, and do not provide a basis for the various findings and

15 requirements of the SYVCP for gateway parcels, particularly in light of the multiple projects

16 sited for cannabis cultivation along Highway 246. The proliferation of the landscaping required

17 to screen cannabis cultivation clustered along Highway 246 will impair lines of sight of

18 landscapes on this scenic route and significantly change the visual character of this important

19 gateway to the Santa Ynez Valley. Importantly, Highway 246 is also elevated above the

20 surrounding parcels, so any development or visual changes along Highway 246 are visible to

21 drivers, including tourists who visit the Santa Ynez Valley for its viewsheds. The Project is

22 located directly on Highway 246, an identified scenic roadway, and thus the various elements of

23 the Project (i.e. fencing, landscaping, and lighting) are also located along Highway 246. This

24 results in impacts to this scenic corridor and merits heightened design consideration by the

25 County. The evidence relied on is also insufficient as to the Project's consistency with the

26 Agricultural Element, as the Project's conflicts with traditional agriculture including viticulture

27 in the Sta. Rita Hills AVA (discussed above) that threaten the viability of the County's

28 agricultural industry are not addressed or mitigated. The Project's consistency with the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 24
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis County of Santa Barbara (Westcoast)

1 SYVCP's prohibition on development in floodplains is not addressed and there is no publicly

2 available evidence that a flood control analysis was performed. With respect to these and other
issues the Board's findings are vague and fail to reveal the analytic route from evidence to
conclusion.

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violations of the California Land Conservation Act (Williamson Act) Cal. Govt. Code
§§51200 et seq.)

61. Petitioner hereby re-alleges and incorporates the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1
10 through 60, inclusive.
11 62. Through the Williamson Act, the County contracts with landowners to restrict their land

12 to agricultural uses for long periods of time. In return, County and State taxpayers subsidize a
13 portion of the landowner's property taxes. The Williamson Act defines which uses qualify for
14 the tax subsidy and requires that qualifying uses must be commercial production of "agricultural
15 commodities". Any use that is not production of an "agricultural commodity" is either

1.6 prohibited or regulated as a compatible use - considered allowed as supportive and secondary,
17 but it cannot be the primary use of the parcel. Cannabis is not defined as an "agricultural
18 commodity" under the Williamson Act's statutory definition of which "agricultural
19 commodities" qualify for Williamson Act subsidies. •
20 63. Discussed in paragraphs 29 and 30, above, the County amended its Uniform Rules to
21 allow cannabis activities on Williamson Act contracted lands and define commercial cannabis

22 cultivation as an "agricultural use" on lands subject to Agricultural Preserve contracts, instead

23 of as a supportive, compatible use. As a consequence, the County's APAC does not review

24 cannabis cultivation proposals on lands enrolled in the County's Agricultural Preserve program

25 for compatibility with adjacent agricultural uses, and applies the minimum production

26 requirements to the proposed cannabis crop. This approach is directly contrary to State law.
27 64. State law makes clear that Cannabis is not defined as an "agricultural commodity" except

28 in one limited context: The Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 25
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Westcoast)

("MAUCRSA") at Business & Professions Code Section 26069(a) specifies that cannabis is an is

2 "agricultural commodity" only for the purposes of MAUCRSA and not under any other State

3 laws, including the Government Code. The Williamson Act is in the Government Code.

4 65. On January 1, 2020, Senate Bill 527 was enacted by amending Sections 51201 and 51231

5 of the Government Code, relating to local government and the Williamson Act. SB 527

6 addressed whether Hemp and cannabis are "agricultural commodities" specifically under the

7 Williamson Act after the adoption of the federal 2018 Farm Bill which classified Hemp as an

8 "agricultural commodity". To conform with federal law, SB 527 added Hemp as an

9 "agricultural commodity" under the Williamson Act and expressly rejected a proposal to do the

10 same with cannabis. SB 527 and enacting legislation provides that commercial cultivation of

11 cannabis may constitute a "compatible use" on contracted or noncontracted lands within an

12 Agricultural Preserve. By express omission of cannabis to the definition of an "agricultural

13 commodity" in January 1, 2020 amendments to the Williamson Act and the narrow treatment of

14 cannabis as an "agricultural commodity" for the purposes of the Medicinal and Adult-Use

15 Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act only, the State's rejection of cannabis as an "agricultural

16 commodity" and attendant protections is clear. Further, SB 527 expressly stated that the enacted

17 provisions are declaratory statements of existing law. With this clarification of State law, the

18 adopted language in the County's Uniform Rules to treat cannabis as "agricultural production"

19 is plainly impermissible and jeopardizes the County's Williamson Act Program.

20 66. This is consistent with how cannabis is treated pursuant to existing State law. For

21 example, cannabis is not an agricultural commodity under the Food and Agricultural Code and

22 Government Code. If cannabis were treated as an agricultural commodity under any

23 circumstances other than in Business & Professions Code Section 26069(a) referenced above,

24 including Food and Agricultural Code or Government Code, all of the existing requirements for

25 agricultural commodities would apply to cannabis, which they do not. Most notably, cannabis

26 has a State licensing structure that operates on an annual basis - no other agricultural

27 commodity has annual licensing requirements. This is a similar legal framework that is applied

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 26
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Westcoast)

1 is to timber, which also is not an agricultural commodity under State law and is subject to its own

2 statutory framework pursuant to the California Timberland Productivity Act of 1982.
67. The definition of "agricultural use" under the Williamson Act is predicated on the use
furthering the production of an "agricultural commodity'. As discussed, infra, cannabis is not

5 an agricultural commodity under State law and thus it cannot be included as "agricultural

6 production" under the Williamson Act. SB 527 makes this designation clear. Local jurisdictions

7 do not have discretion to the deviate from the determination of which crops are agricultural

8 commodities and which are not.

9 68. Based on the foregoing, State law requires cannabis be treated as a "compatible" use

10 subject to the compatibility principles described above. The County's Uniform Rules are

11 inconsistent with the Williamson Act and the Board of Supervisors abused its discretion in

12 relying upon them in approving the Westcoast Project.

13 69. The APAC's review of the project included a finding under Uniform Rules 2-2.1D that

14 the accessory uses of the property are compatible with surrounding agriculture, but lacked any

15 analysis or finding concerning whether the cannabis cultivation was compatible with

16 surrounding agriculture, which it is not. The absence of APAC's analysis prevented a

17 conclusion whether the Project's nnabis cultivation could be found compatible with

18 surrounding agricultural uses on other nearby and adjacent Williamson Act contracted lands.

19 70. For all the above reasons, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion and failed to

20 proceed in accordance with law.
