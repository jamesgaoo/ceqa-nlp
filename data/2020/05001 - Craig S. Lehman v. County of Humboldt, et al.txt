P PLN-12733-SP and PLN-12747-SP (*Applications") which involve a "0.12 acre site located

2 on Redwood Drive, the main thoroughfare of the town of Garberville, with zoning designation of

3 Community Commercial and a Design Review combining zone (C-2-D), and land use

4 designation of Commercial General". See Agenda Item Transmittal ("AIT') at p. 3. This appeal

5 was not responded to by the County of Humboldt ("County") within the time period prescribed

6 by the Humboldt County Code ("HCC") (the Board is required by HCC section 312-13.5 to hold

7 the first hearing before Board of Supervisors to consider the appeal within thirty (30) working

8 days after the date of filing the appeal). The Planning Commission approved the Humboldt

9 County Planning Department's ("Planning Department") assertion that these Applications "were

10 exempt from environmental review per Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, sections 15201 (Existing

11 Facilities) and 15303 (New Construction or Conversion of Small Structures) of the California

12 Environmental Quality Act (CEAQ) Guidelines." AIT at p. 3.

13 This appeal, which appears to have been abandoned by the County, is being prosecuted in

14 compliance with HCC section 312-13.2 ("the appellant shall state specifically why the decision

15 of the Hearing Officer is not in accord with the standards and regulations of the zoning

16 ordinances, or why it is believed that there was an error or an abuse of discretion by the Hearing

17 Officer."), and appeal fees of $1,548 were paid to the County of Humboldt ("County")
18 contemporaneously to the filling of the appeal.

19 What is hereinafter referred to as the "Project" underlying this action is described by the
20 Humboldt County Planning Department as follows:

21 "This project consists of two applications requesting permits pursuant to the Commercial Medical Marijuana Land Use Ordinance (CMMLUO). A special 22 Permit (SP) is requested for a cannabis distribution facility (App #12733), and a SP is requested for a commercial cannabis manufacturing facility(App #12747). 23 Manufacturing involves the use of mechanical machinery and ethanol to extract products such as kief, hash and rosin. No flammable solvent materials are used.
24 The site is currently developed with a three-story commercial building, a two-

25

26 1 The Agenda Item Transmittal submitted by John Ford, Planning Director ("Planning Director"), to the Planning Commission for its December 5, 2019, meeting, at page 2 describes
27 the location of the two applications as "located in the Garberville area, on the East side of Redwood Drive, approximately 80 feet north from the intersection of Sprowel Creek Road and Redwood Drive, on the property known as 829 Redwood Drive," with a Humboldt County 28 Assessor's Parcel Number of 032-051-032.

-4 story concrete building, and two-story storage facility. Extraction operations

2 will occur on the first floor of the three-story building in the existing retail space. The use of the 2nd floor office space and 3rd floor residence will not change as a result of this project. In addition, flower and pre-rolls will be packaged for
3 distribution. The project proposes to demolish the existing concrete building and

4 construct in its place a 180-square foot metal building to house a closed loop ethanol extraction unit. The storage building will be retrofitted with a walk-in refrigeration unit to store cannabis products for the distribution operation. The
5 subject parcel is served by public water and sewer service from the Garberville Sanitation District (GSD). Electrical power to the building is supplied by Pacific
6 Gas & Electric Company (PGE). The applicant is requesting a Special Permit for

7 an exception to the size of the loading space requirements described by HCC Section 109.1. The Zoning Administrator will also consider approval of the design

8 review study as prepared by the applicant per HCC. 314-19-1.3."

26 3 The Califorpia Environmental Quality Act is found at Public Resources Code section 21000, et seq., and is hereinafter referred to as "CEQA."
27 4 The California Environmental Quality Act Guidelines are found at Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15000, et seq., and are hereinafter referred to as "CEQA 28 Guidelines."

WRIT OF MANDATE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF (n)

23003.

2 4. Respondent Humboldt County Board of Supervisors ("the Board") is the duly
3 constituted governing body for the County. Harris v. Gibbins, 114 Cal. 418 (1896). As such, the
Board is ultimately responsible for seeing that the County's mandated legal duties and
compliance with applicable law are carried out, including without limitation compliance with the

6 2017 General Plan; compliance with CEQA, compliance with the CEQA Guidelines, and

7 compliance with California zoning laws, as well as its own Humboldt County Code. In addition,

8 the Board is the appointing authority for the Planning Director and endows the Planning Director

9 with all legal and other authority possessed by the Planning Director.

10 5. The Planning Commission is a permanent committee made up of five or more
11. individuals who have been appointed by the Board to review and act on matters related to
12 planning and development. Government Code $65100.

13 6. Respondents are the "lead agency" for the Project for purposes of Public

14 Resources Code section 21067, and has principal responsibility for conducting environmental

15 review for the Project and taking other actions necessary to comply with CEQA.

16 7. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereupon alleges that Respondent
17 Humboldt County Planning Director is the appointing authority for the Staff of the Humboldt

18 County Planning Department ("Planning Department"), who perform the work coming before the
19 Planning Department. When the Planning Director is the assigned decision-making body on a

20 project within the Planning Department's purview, he is responsible for ensuring that an

21 adequate environmental process occurs for a project. Petitioner is informed and believes and
22 thereupon alleges that the Planning Department develops the staff reports or AITs for the

23 meetings at which the Planning Commission and Board conduct their hearings regarding the
24 Planning Department matters, and in conjunction with this, is tasked with recording public

25 comment and obtaining comments from other agencies on the expected environmental effects of

26 a project; identifying appropriate measures to reduce the potentially significant effects of a

27 project to non-significant levels; preparing, assessing, and processing all environmental

28 documents for Respondents; preparing, distributing, and filing applicable notices, including,

VERIFIED PETITION FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
WRIT OF MANDATE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 4

1 without limitation, any Notices of Determination for the implementation measures approved by

2 the Planning Commission and/or the Board; coordinating and implementing Respondents'

3 environmental review procedures consistent with policy direction provided by the Board;

4 establishing informal and working thresholds of significance and proposing formal thresholds.

5 8. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereupon alleges that, at all times herein

6 mentioned, each of the Respondents herein were the agents and employees of the County of

7 Humboldt and were at all times acting within the purpose and scope of such agency and

8 employment.

9 9. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereupon alleges that Respondents will

10 continue to fail to act, allowing Real Parties in Interest to continue their unlawful practices unless

11 directed and/or restrained and enjoined by this Court.

12 Real Parties in Interest

13 10. Petitioner is informed and believes that a real party in a interest in this matter is a

14 California limited liability company with the number 201514710030, and entitled as the

15 Emerald Triangle Group, LLC ( hereinafter "Emerald Triangle" or "Applicant").

16 11. As of the filing of this action, the California Secretary of State web page lists
17 Emerald Triangle as an limited liability company which has been suspended (*FTB Suspended").

18 12. When a California business entity is suspended, it may lose many of its powers,

19 rights and privilege within the State of California (Rev. & Tax Code § 23301), and "Every
20 contract made in this state by taxpayer during the time that the taxpayer's powers, rights, and

21 privileges are suspended or forfeited pursuant to Section 23301, 23301.5, or 23775 shall, subject

22 to Section 23304.5, be voidable at the request of any party to the contract other than the

23 taxpayer." Rev & Tax Code § 23304.1.(a).

24 13. As of July 16, 2019 (the date of the filling with the California Secretary of State

25 form LLC-12, document number 19-C69470), Joseph Bilandzija is listed as a manager or

26 member of Emerald Triangle Group LLC, with his address shown as 827 Redwood Drive,
27 Garberville, which is next to 829 Redwood Drive, the location of the Project.

28 14. Petitioner is informed and believes that Joseph Bilandzija ("Bilandzija"), who is

VERIFIED PETITION FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
WRIT OF MANDATE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- listed as the applicant/owner/agent at page of the AIT submitted to the Planning Commission

2 for its December 5, 2019, meeting is a real party in interest. Another basis for Petitioner's

3 information and belief as to Bilandzija's status as a real party in interest is due to the fact that

4 when there exists a lack of a functioning legal entity as a result of a suspension, the suspended

5 business entity's owners may be subjected to personal liability based on the debts, obligations

6 and/or liabilities of the business entity.5

7 15. Emerald Triangle and Bilandzija are collectively referred to herein as "Real

8 Parties in Interests."

9 16.

10 Petitioner is informed and believes and thereupon alleges that, at all times herein.

11 mentioned, each of the Real Parties in Interest herein were the agents and employees of each of

12 the remaining Real Parties in Interest and were at all times acting within the purpose and scope of
such agency and employment.

13 DOES 1 through 50

14 17.

15 Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties in Interest
sued herein as DOES 1 through 50, and therefore sues these Does by such fictitious names.

16 Petitioner will amend this complaint to allege their true names and capacities when ascertained.

17 Petitioner is informed and believes and thereupon alleges that each of these fictitiously named

18 Does claim to be affected by Respondents' actions regarding the Project.

19 III. JURISDICTION, RIPENESS, AND VENUE

20 Jurisdiction

21 18. This court has jurisdiction of this proceeding pursuant to either Code of Civil

22 Procedure, section 1060; Code of Civil Procedure, section 525, et seq. (injunctive relief), Public

23

24 Resources Code, sections 21100, et seq.; Code of Civil Procedure, section 1094.5 (administrative
mandate); and/or Article VI, Section 10 of the California Constitution.

25 19. Respondents have the legal duty in making their decisions comply with the

26

27 applicable law and regulations governing such acts, including Respondents' ministerial duties,

28 5 Casiopea Bovet, LLC v. Chiang, 12 Cal. App. 5th 656, 662 (2017).

VERIFIED PETITION FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
WRIT OF MANDATE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 6

including without limitation the processing of Petitioner's appeal to the Board in timely

2 fashion. Respondents acted arbitrarily, capriciously, irrationally, and unreasonably, and without

3 any or an adequate evidentiary basis in failing or refusing to comply with the requirements of

4 CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and the Humboldt County Code, including Respondents'

5 ministerial duties mandated therewith.

6 20. At all times material herein, Respondents have, and continue to have, the ability to

7 comply with their legal duties and obligations, including Respondents' ministerial duties.

8 Respondents have failed and refused to perform those duties, and such failures and refusals are

9 contrary to law and regulations and will have adverse consequences on Petitioner.

10 21. The violations by Respondents as alleged herein have affected the beneficial

11 interests of Petitioner. The relief sought by way of this Petition will redress this beneficial
12 interest and the likelihood of further injury and interference with Petitioner' interests, and those

13 of its support members.

14 22. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
15 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside its

16 approval of the Project and supporting documents. In the absence of such remedies,

17 Respondents' decisions will remain in effect in violation of state law and injurious to Petitioner.

18 Ripeness Via Humboldt County Code Appellate Procedures

19 23. Humboldt County Code section 312-13 outlines the procedures for appeals to the

20 Board.

21 24. Code section 312-13.1 (Appeals to the Board of Supervisors) states:

22 "Except as otherwise stated in this Code, any person, as defined in this Code,

23 aggrieved by àn action taken by the Hearing Öfficer on any completed application, may appeal such action to the Board of Supervisors by filing a notice of appeal with the Department within ten (10) working days of said action. Appeals on 24 Coastal Development Permits for subdivisions shall be filed within 10 calendar days of the decision of the Hearing Officer. Upon receipt of the notice of appeal,
25 the Department shall transmit to the Clerk of the Board a copy of the notice of

26 appeal. An appeal fee as set by resolution of the Board of Supervisors shall be paid when the appeal is filed. This section does not apply to a rezoning or an amendment to this division. (Note: For subdivision appeals see Subdivision
27 Regulations.) (Former Section INL#317-51; CZ#A315-26(A); Ord. 946, Sec. 4, 10/2/73; Amended by Ord. 1206, Sec. 2, 3/21/73; Amended by Ord. 1351, Sec. 1,
28 8/28/79; Amended by Ord. 1889, Sec. 1, 3/6/90; Amended by Ord. 2214, 6/6/00)."

VERIFIED PETITION FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
WRIT OF MANDATE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 25. Petitioner complied with Code section 312-13.2 and filled out the standard form

2 provided by Respondents, on which Petitioner stated specifically why the decision of the

3 Planning Commission is not in accord with the standards and regulations of the law and why

4 Petitioner believes that there was an error or an abuse of discretion by the Planning Commission.

5 26. Pursuant to Code section 312-13.1, Petitioner's timely appeal has stayed the
6 proceedings and the effective date of the action of the Planning Commission, until the appeal has

7 been acted upon by the Board or withdrawn by Petitioner.

8 27. The Board is required by Code section 312-13.5 to hold its first hearing to

9 consider the appeal within thirty (30) working days after the date of filing the appeal. The Board

10 failed to do so.

11 28. By appealing the decision of the Planning Commission, complete with depositing

12 with the County $1,548 in appeal fees, Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent

13 to filing this action and has exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law

14 under Public Resources Code section 21177. Petitioner has no method of forcing the Board to

15 hear this appeal, and this Board hearing has not been set withing the time period mandated by

16 law. Petitioner and/or other entities and/or individuals raised the legal deficiencies asserted in

17 this Petition orally and in writing during Respondents' decision-making process.

18 Venue

19 29. Venue for this action properly lies in the Humboldt County Superior Court
20 because Petitioner, the subject matter of this litigation, and the Project, lie entirely within the

21 unincorporated areas of Humboldt County, California, and the environmental impacts of the

22 Project will be acutely felt in this County. The causes alleged in this Petition arose and are

23 located in this County. Code of Civil Procedure §§ 393 (actions against public officers), 394

24 (action against a county), and 395 (actions generally). See also Cal. State Parks Foundation v.

25 Superior Court, 150 Cal. App. 4th 826, 833, et seq. (2007).

26 Statutory Notice Reguirements Have Been Met

27 30. Petitioner has provided written notice of his intention to file this petition to

28 Respondents in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5, and is including this

VERIFIED PETITION FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
WRIT OF MANDATE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

p notice as Exhibit A, attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

2 31.

3 Petitioner has concurrently filed a notice of his election to prepare the record of
administrative proceedings relating to this action, in compliance with Public Resources Code

4 Section 21167.6 or other applicable laws, and include this notice of election as Exhibit B,

5 attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

6 32. Petitioner will provide notice of this action to the California Attorney General by
7 serving a copy of this Petition along with a notice of its filing. Publ. Res. Code § 21167.7; Code

8 Civ. Proc. § 388.

9 IV. STANDARD OF REVIEW

10 Declaratory Relief

11 33. To qualify for declaratory relief, it must be demonstrated that the action "presents

12 two essential elements: 1) a proper subject of declaratory relief; and 2) an actual controversy

13 involving justiciable questions relating to [Petitioner's] rights or obligations ... . [Citation.]"
14 Brownfield v. Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital, 208 Cal. App. 3d 405, 410 (1989). A
15 | declaration of rights or duties with respect to property may be a proper subject of declaratory

16

17 relief. (Code Civ. Proc., § 1060; Stonehouse Homes, supra, 167 Cal. App. 4th at 539.)." Wilson
& Wilson v. City Council of Redwood City, 191 Cal. App. 4th 1559, 1582 (2011).

18 CEQA

19 34. Under Public Resources Code section 21168.5, a prejudicial abuse of discretion
20 may be shown if the agency "has not proceeded in a manner required by law." Western States

21 Petroleum Assn. v. Superior Court, 9 Cal. 4th 559, beginning at 568 (1995).

22 35. "Where the challenge is that the agency

23 did not proceed in the manner required by

24 law, a court must decide de novo whether the agency has employed the correct procedures,
'scrupulously enforc[ing] all legislatively mandated CEQA requirements. .." Vineyard Area

25 Citizens for Responsible Growth Inc. V. City of Rancho Cordova, 40 Cal. 4th 412, 435 (2007),

26 cited to by Sierra Club v. County of San Diego, 231 Cal App. 4th 1152, 1164 (2014).

27 36. Under Public Resources Code section 21168.5, a prejudicial abuse of discretion

28 may be shown if the agency's finding, determination, or decision is not supported by substantial

VERIFIED PETITION FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
WRIT OF MANDATE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 9

1 evidence. Western States Petroleum Ass 'n V. Superior Court, supra, beginning at 568.

2 37. "Substantial evidence for CEQA purposes is 'enough relevant information and

3 reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a

4 conclusion, even though other conclusions might also be reached." CEQA Guidelines § 15384.

5 38. Substantial evidence includes "facts, reasonable assumptions predicated upon

6 facts, and expert opinion supported by facts." [Citation.] It does not include "argument, It

7 speculation, unsubstantiated opinion or narrative, clearly erroneous or inaccurate evidence, or

8 evidence of social or economic impacts which do not contribute to or are not caused by physical

9 impacts on the environment. [Citation.]" Preserve Wild Santee v. City of Santee, 210 Cal. App.

10 4th 260, 275-276 (2012).

11 39. "Only those projects having no significant effect on the environment are

12 categorically exempt from CEQA review. [Citations.] If a project may have a significant effect a

13 on the environment, CEQA review must occur and only then are mitigation measures

14 relevant. [Citation.] Mitigation measures may support a negative declaration [or a

15 mitigated negative declaration] but not a categorical exemption." San Francisco Beautiful v.

16 City and County oj San Francisco, 226 Cal. App. 4th 1012, 1032 (2014).

17 40. The Fair Argument test is derived from Cal. Pub. Res. Code § 21151, which
18 requires an EIR on any project that may have a significant effect on the environment. That

19 section mandates preparation of an EIR in the first instance whenever it can be fairly argued on

20 the basis of substantial evidence that the project may have significant environmental impact. If

21 there is substantial evidence of such impact, contrary evidence is not adequate to support a

22 decision to dispense with an EIR. CEQA Guidelines § 15064(g), (h). Section 21151 creates a low a

23 threshold requirement for initial preparation of an EIR and reflects preference for resolving

24 doubts in favor of environmental review when the question is whether any such review is

25 warranted. Sierra Club v. County of Sonoma, supra, at 1312.

26 41. CEQA Guidelines section 15064(f)(1) provides: A direct physical change in the

27 environment is a physical change in the environment which is caused by and immediately related

28 to the project. Examples of direct physical changes in the environment are the dust, noise, and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
WRIT OF MANDATE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 10

traffic. It includes such things as odor, fire risks, parking, and lighting.

2 42. CEQA Guidelines section 15064, subdivision (f)(1), "If the lead agency
determines there is substantial evidence in the record that the project may have a significant

4 effect on the environment, the lead agency shall prepare an EIR (Friends ofB Street v. City of
Hayward, 106 Cal. App. 3d 988 (1980). Said another way, if a lead agency is presented with
a fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the environment, the lead
agency shall prepare an EIR even though it may also it be presented with other substantial

8 evidence that the project will not have a significant effect (No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles,

9 13 Cal. 3d 68 (1974).' If, however, an agency's "initial study" for a nonexempt project "shows

10 that there is no substantial evidence that the project may have a significant effect" on the

11 environment, the agency "prepares a negative declaration" (Guidelines, § 15002, subd. (k)(2))

12 describing "the reasons" why no EIR is required (§ 21064). (Berkeley Hillside Preservation v.

13 City of Berkeley, 60 Cal.4th 1086, 1111-1112 (2015).)

14 43. The court must set aside the decision if the administrative record contains

15 substantial evidence that a proposed project may have a significant environmental impact; in

16 a such a case, the agency has not proceeded as required by law. Sierra Club v. County of Sonoma,

17 supra, at 1317, cited by Sierra Club v. County of San Diego, supra, at 1164.

18 V. STATUTORY FRAMEWORK

19 California Environmental Quality Act

20 44. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereupon alleges, that in order to bring

21 themselves in compliance with the law, a CEQA process, including without limitation, an

22 environmental impact report ("EIR") would be required because Respondents will be unable to

23 find with certainty that the activity associated with the Project will not have a significant effect a

24 on the environment. See CEQA Guidelines § 15061(b)(3).

25 45. Passed in 1970 as a state counterpart to the National Environmental Policy Act

26 (NEPA), CEQA requires state and local agencies to identify the potentially significant

27 environmental impacts of their actions, and then to avoid or mitigate those impacts if feasible.

28 46. CEQA has two primary purposes. First, CEQA is designed to inform decision

VERIFIED PETITION FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
WRIT OF MANDATE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 11

makers and the public about the potential, significant environmental effects of a project. CEQA
Guidelines § 15002(a)(1). " The fundamental goals of environmental review under CEQA are
information, participation, mitigation and accountability. Lincoln Place Tenants Ass'n v. City of

4 Los Angeles, 155 Cal. App. 4th 425, 444-445 (2007), cited by Sierra Club v. County of San
Diego, 231 Cal App. 4th 1152, 1164 (2019). 'It's purpose is to inform the public and its

6 responsible officials of the environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made.

7 Thus, the EIR *protects not only environment but also informed self-government." [Emphasis
added.] Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors, 52 Cal. 3d. 553, 564 (1990), quoting

9 Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. V. Regents of University of California, 47 Cal.3d 376, 392

10 (1988).

11 47. Second, CEQA requires public agencies to avoid or reduce environmental damage

12 when feasible by requiring environmentally superior alternatives and all feasible mitigation

13 measures. CEQA Guidelines § 15002(a)(2) and (3); Citizens of Goleta Valley, supra, at 564-

14 566.

15 48. An agency is not permitted to evade standards governing the preparation of a
16 mitigated negative declaration by evaluating proposed mitigation measures in connection with

17 the significant effect exception to a categorical exemption. a Citizens for Environmental
18 Responsibility v. State ex rel. 14th Dist. Ag. Assn., 242 Cal. App. 4th 555, 557, (2015).

19 49. The required CEQA environmental review involves both substantive and
20 procedural steps. Public participation plays an important and protected role in the CEQA

21 process. Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n, supra, at 392 (*The EIR process protects not only

22 the environment but also informed self-government."); Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa, Inc. V.

23 32nd Dist. Ag. Assoc., 42 Cal. 3d 929, 936 (1986) (members of the public have privileged
24 position in the CEQA process). "Each public agency should include provisions in its CEQA

25 procedures for wide public involvement, formal and informal, consistent with its existing

26 activities and procedures, in order to receive and evaluate public reactions to environmental

27 issues related to the agency's activities." CEQA Guidelines § 15201. [Emphasis added.]

28 50. Procedurally, a lead agency may not approve a project until the public has been

VERIFIED PETITION FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
WRIT OF MANDATE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 12

given a full and adequate opportunity to participate and comment on the project. (Discussion

2 following CEQA Guidelines § 15082. See also CEQA Guidelines §§ 15201 and 15200.

3 51. CEQA also disallows approval of project that fails to comply with other laws. A

4 lead agency may not approve a project with significant unavoidable impacts unless it is

5 "otherwise permissible under applicable laws and regulation." Pub. Resources Code §21002.1(c).

52. "Only those projects having no significant effect on the environment are
categorically exempt from CEQA review. [Citations.] If project may have a significant effect

8 on the environment, CEQA review must occur and only then are mitigation measures relevant.
[Citation.] Mitigation measures may support a negative declaration [or a mitigated negative

10 declaration] but not a categorical exemption." San Francisco Beautiful v. City and County of San

11 Francisco, 226 Cal. App. 4th 1012, 1032 (2014).

12 53. Reliance upon mitigation measures (whether included in the application or later

13 adopted during the permitting process) involves an evaluative process of assessing those
14 mitigation measures and weighing them against potential environmental impacts. That process
15 must be conducted under established CEQA standards and procedures for EIRs (environmental

16 impact reports) or negative declarations.

17 54. Absent a notice of determination having been issued, an action alleging that a

18 public agency is "carrying out or has approved a project that may have a significant effect on the
19  environment" without having followed CEQA procedures with a legitimate approval of the

20 project must be commenced within "180 days from the date of the public agency's decision to

21 carry out or approve the project, or, if a project is undertaken without formal decision by the

22 public agency, within 180 days from the date of the commencement of the project." Pub. Res.

23 Code § 21167(a).

24 55. CEQA contains a strong preference in favor of preparation of an EIR whenever

25 there is a Fair Argument that a proposed project "may have significant adverse environmental

26 impacts." County Sanitation Dist. No. 2 v. County of Kern, 127 Cal. App. 4th 1544, 1559 (2005).

27 56. CEQA Guidelines section 15064, subdivision (f)(1) states: "If the lead agency
28 determines there is substantial evidence in the record that the project may have a significant a

VERIFIED PETITION FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
WRIT OF MANDATE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 13

effect on the environment, the lead agency shall prepare an EIR. If an agency's "initial study" for

2 a nonexempt project "shows that there is no substantial evidence that the project may have a

3 significant effect" on the environment, the agency "prepares a negative declaration" CEQA

4 Guidelines § 15002(k)(2) describing "the reasons" why no EIR is required (Pub. Res. Code 0p

5 21064); Berkeley Hillside Preservation v. City of Berkeley, 60 Cal.4th 1086, 1111-1112 (2015).

6 Requirements of an EIR

7 57. To ensure that governmental agencies and the public are adequately informed

8 about the environmental impact of public decisions, CEQA requires a lead agency to prepare an

9 EIR before approving a new project that "may have a significant effect on the environment." Pub.

10 Res. Code § 21067; Pub. Res. Code 21151(a); Friends of College of San Mateo Gardens V. San

11 Mateo County Community College Dist., Cal. 5th 937, 944 (2016).

12 58. The EIR has been described as "an environmental 'alarm bell' whose purpose is to

13 alert the public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached

14 ecological points of no return." Laurel Heights, supra, at 392.

15 59. The purpose of the EIR is "to provide public agencies and the public in general

16 with detailed information about the effect which proposed project is likely to have on the

17 environment; to list ways in which the significant effects of such a project might be minimized;

18 and to indicate alternatives to such a project." Pub. Res. Code § 21061. §

19 60. Without accurate and complete information pertaining to the setting of the project

20 and surrounding uses, it cannot be found that any EIR or Project EIR ("PEIR") adequately

21 investigated and discussed the environmental impacts of the project. See San Joaquin

22 Raptor/Wildlife Rescue Center v. County of Stanislaus, 27 Cal. App. 4th 713, 729 (1994). Thus,

23 "[i]f the description of the environmental setting of the project site and surrounding area is

24 inaccurate, incomplete or misleading, the EIR does not comply with CEQA." Cadiz Land Co. v.

25 Jail Cycle, 83 Cal. App. 4th 74, 87 (2000). A stable and accurate description of the surrounding

26 area is no less crucial than a stable and accurate description of the project. City of Irvine v.

27 County of Orange, 238 Cal. App. 4th 526, 542, fn. 8 (2015).

28 61. The data in an EIR must not only be sufficient in quantity, it must be presented in

VERIFIED PETITION FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
WRIT OF MANDATE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 14

a manner calculated to adequately inform the public and decision makers, who may not be

2 previously familiar with the details of the project and references in appendices is insufficient to
adequately inform the public or decision makers. Vineyard Area Citizens, supra, at 442, citing
CEQA Guidelines § § 15150 and 15153.

62. "A prejudicial abuse of discretion occurs if the failure to include relevant
information precludes informed decision making and informed public participation, thereby
thwarting the statutory goals of the EIR process. [Citations Omitted]." Banning Ranch

8 Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach, 2 Cal. 5th 918, 942 (2017).

9 VI. GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

10 The Neighborhood Containing the Project

11 63. Petitioner incorporates paragraphs 1-63 above and adds:

12 64. The Project is located in C2 light commercial zone in downtown Garberville,

13 and has been light retail for decades. It was formerly "Miranda's Rescue Thrift Shop" and was a

14 small clothing store before that.

15 65. The building and the surrounding buildings are very old wood-frame construction

16 and were built in the early-to-mid 1900s.

17 66. All of the surrounding businesses are small, commercial light retail businesses.

18 67. The block upon which these small retail business are located has no setbacks

19 between buildings.

20 68. There is a Residential zone behind the project site with homes all within three

21 hundred (300) feet of the project site and would be thereby affected by noise from a twenty-four

22 hours per day, seven days per week ("24/7") operation, odor, parking, lighting, etc.

23 (Residences/homes are in back of the Project site on the other side of a very narrow alley).

24 69. There are three churches and a preschool all within six-hundred (600) feet. One

25 church and preschool is about one hundred fifty (150) feet from the site, and the other two

26 churches about four hundred feet of the site. While one church (along with its preschool) was
27 damaged by fire, it is in the process of being rebuilt.

28

70. is There is limited parking for employees" in the narrow alley behind the site, which

2 is used by all of the other business owners, making it likely difficult or impossible to maneuver

3 fire trucks during the day when businesses use the alley. There is likely no other parking other

4 than for two cars off the alley.

5 71. The alley's ingress and egress is limited. There is an easement for the project

6 applicant to use the alley in one direction only up to the project site but not past that site as there

7 is a locked gate. As such, delivery trucks have little-to-no turn around ability during the day, and

8 the delivery trucks would have to block the alley stopping ingress and egress of the property

9 owners who occupy businesses past the project site. Also, it is likely delivery trucks will not only

10 block the alley from ingress and egress for users located past this project site, but the delivery

11 trucks may have to back in reverse down the driveway after delivery.

12 72. A business is operated on the second floor of the Project area.

13 73. A residential unit(s) occupies the third floor of the Project area.

14 The Project and the Claimed Categorical Exemptions

15 74. This Project is described as a Manufacturing Site for "kief, hash, rosin, steam

16 distilled terpenes and pre-rolls."

17 75. The manufacturing process uses ethanol described as a non-volatile process, but

18 ethanol itself is volatile.

19 76. The Project is also for a mass distribution a center, wherein product will be

20 packaged on site at this off site processing facility and sent out. Cannabis will be delivered from

21 all over the area and then packaged on site and distributed, or manufactured into hash, packaged

22 and then distributed.

23 77. The Project is described as taking/buying cannabis, packaging it, and also

24 manufacturing it on site, then distributing raw and packaged cannabis goods.

25 78. Hours of activity are up to twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week.

26 79. This Project is for two Special Permits to operate (1) a cannabis manufacturing

27
6
28 The narrow alley iS used by the existing businesses' employees to keep the few parking spaces (13) in front open for customers.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
WRIT OF MANDATE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 16

and (2) distribution business; the Project is not for building permits for existing structures of the
same size or for new construction. The Special Permits are required in order to allow an
industrial use in a light retail area.

4 80. The CEQA Exemptions listed in by the Project Applicant and Planning
Department are inapplicable to the Project since this Project expands the existing use from light
retail to industrial.

7 81. The Department has claimed that there is a categorical exemption for the Project,

8 exempting it from any and all CEQA environmental analysis.

82. The exemption claimed is not applicable to the Project because it expands the use
10 from light retail to industrial. Only in the event that the use is not expanded or changed may this

11 categorical exemption be claimed. Since the use is expanded, such an exemption cannot be

12 lawfully used.

13 83. Because there are facts presenting a fair argument of impacts to the environment,

14 contained in the administrative record, a CEQA analysis is mandated as a matter of law, and the

15 categorical exemption cannot be claimed to evade formal environmental review.

16 84. Petitioner formally objected to the approval of the Project based upon the fact that
17 there is a fair argument of significant impacts to the environment.

18 85. The Project is for Special Permit for installation of a manufacturing and mass

19 distribution (industrial) facility that allows 24/7 operations in a light retail area deemed CG

20 where industrial is neither principally permitted nor an existing use.

21 86. Approval of industrial manufacturing and distribution is an expansion of the

22 existing use for the site.

23 87. While the neighboring businesses and residents think the Project itself is good for

24 Southern Humboldt, they are adamant that the site is not appropriate for the Project due to the
25 limitations of the light retail area, the location of the preschool and churches, and the location of

26 homes. They also objected to expansion of use to a 24/7 mass distribution and manufacturing

27 enterprise which is industrial. They objected to the fire dangers from the proposed project given

28 the fact that the block upon which it will be located is currently that of 100 year old wooden

VERIFIED PETITION FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
WRIT OF MANDATE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 17

1 structures with zero setbacks between the buildings. They objected to the limited parking spaces
2 being used for the employees of the business. They objected to both lighting and noise from the

3 proposed 24/7 manufacturing and distribution center.

4 88. This project consists of two special permits in a CG zone; this is not a C3 zone

5 where this project would be principally permitted.. While it is in a C2 zone, there are no existing

6 industrial uses anywhere else in this C2 zone and certainly not within site of the project location

89. The Planning Departments' conditions of approval inserted into the finding of the

8 exemption measures to mitigate some of the impacts from this project. The categorical

9 exemption cannot be applied to this project because the public has provided facts which support

10 fair argument that there are impacts to the environment which are unique to this proposed

11 industrial/distribution facility and which are very different from anything presented by the

12 operation of the light retail establishments that currently exist in the area.

13 90. During the Planning Commission hearing, numerous members of the public

14 spoke and presented the Commission with facts that fair argument exists that the Project may

15 have direct impacts to the environment because of the expansion from the currently permitted

16 use, which is light retail, to industrial manufacturing and distribution.

17 91. The fire department, neighboring businesses, and even pastor submitted written
18 comments regarding the potential direct impacts from the expansion of use from light retail to a

19 24/7 industrial/distribution/manufacturing enterprise. The impacts they discussed are quite

20 different than any impacts from the existing light retail businesses, including but not limited to:

21 noise, odor, and lighting from a 24/7 operation; fire protection from the operation of the hash

22 manufacturing and storage of ethanol on site; lack of parking for an expanded 24/7
23 industrial/distribution facility with three different shifts of employees; marginal access in the

24 alley for delivery trucks when the alley is used by other business owners for parking.

25 92. The impacts of the Project also include the existence of at least three "Sensitive

26 Receptors" located very close to the Project site as defined pursuant to HCC ordinance 314-
27 55.4.6.4.4.1.3, seemingly making any grant of a special permit impossible.

28 93. Community members have objected and object to how this Project is proceeding

VERIFIED PETITION FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
WRIT OF MANDATE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 18

under categorical exemption because proceeding in this manner avoids the CEQA

2 EIR/Negative Declaration process where the discussion of appropriate mitigation measures

3 lawfully belong.

94. Respondents dismissed facts that establish that a fair argument exists that the

5 Project may have environmental impacts that are not present from the operation of the existing

6 small retail establishments.

95. The facts establishing a fair argument were submitted to the Planning Department
as well as to the Planning Commission and belie the Planning Department's recommendation

9 that the Project is exempt from CEQA, since fair argument based upon those facts has been

10 expressed by neighbors that the Project may have direct environmental impacts.

11 96. Once the concerns of direct impacts became part of the official record,

12 Respondents are duty bound to conduct either an EIR or Negátive Declaration.

13 97. The Project cannot proceed in this manner avoiding formal environmental review.

14 The Department claims the categorical exemption by inserting conditions of approval into the

15 project and claiming these conditions qualify the Project for the categorical exemption; actually

16 because of the Department's imposition of certain conditions of approval this matter must

17 proceed with formal environmental review (EIR/Negative Declaration).

18 98. All mitigation measures must be imposed through the CEQA process and not by

19 "conditions of approval" from the Department.

20 Project Alternatives Listed in the AIT

21 99. The alternatives to the Project not recommended by the Department and listed in

22 the AIT for the hearing of December 5, 2019, at pages 9-10 are:

23 1) The Commission could elect not to approve the project; 2) The Commission could approve only portions of the Project that do not
24 involve the use of ethanol extraction;

25 3) The Commission could require the Real Party(s) in Interest to submit further evidence, or modify the Project; or 4) The Commission could decide the Project may have environmental impacts
26 that would require further environmental review pursuant to CEQA.

27 The Writtten Record

28 100. The written record before the Pianning Commission, which consists of the AIT

VERIFIED PETITION FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
WRIT OF MANDATE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 19

1 and letters submitted to the County, become part of the record on appeal and includes, but is not

2 limited to:

3 Page 102 - Recommendation to deny special permit by the chief of the Garberville Fire

4 Protection District due to fire concerns;

5 Page 105-110 - Letter to the Commission from by Harland Law Firm, LLP;

6 Page 111 - Fax cover sheet from Pastor Craig Parkenson to Supervisor Fennel;

7 Page 112-113 - Letter from Paster Parkenson discussing the existence of the church and

8 school, the age of the building, the fact that the alley cannot handle the traffic for a

9 manufacturing and distribution center, the restrictive parking for the existing retail

10 businesses being unable to handle the 24/7 manufacturing operation; fire concerns for a

11 100 year old building;
12 Page 114-115 - Letter from Brian Winterberg (property owner, three addresses

13 neighboring the Project site) regarding the risk of fire from ethanol storage anywhere on

14 site as it presents a severe threat to the other retail businesses on the whole block

15 (especially due to the age of the buildings on the block and lack of setbacks);
16 Pages 118-119, Letter from Karen Miclette - regarding the fact that Garberville's main

17 street is not an industrial park and that she objects to the odors and traffic associated with

18 a mass distribution and manufacturing facility on behalf of herself, her staff and her

19 clients. She expressed her concerns of the very limited space in the alley which is already

20 full and that the alley is so narrow that the Recology trash truck must come at 7:00 A.M.

21 before working people get to the existing businesses because there is no room to pull in

22 afterwards. She stated there was an inability to store a delivery truck in the alley, and a

23 there was no ability to have a loading area in the alley due to the fact that there is only one

24 way in and out (since the alley is fenced off directly adjacent to the Project site. She

25 stated that the parking restrictions cannot support a 24/7 industrial manufacturing and

26 distribution center either in the alley or in the thirteen spaces in front that provide the only

27 parking for customers for the existing six retail businesses. She expressed concerns

28 regarding the fact that there is little wastewater capacity on site for the manufacturing

process and that, while the ethanol extraction process may be a non-volatile process,

2 ethanol is volatile and has no place in a small retail district composed of 100-year-old

3 wooden structures.

The Oral Record

101. The oral record is captured on the DVD of the Planning Commission proceedings

6 and includes but is not limited to the oral testimony presented by:

7 I. Brooke Epperly - Opposed to the use of ethanol in an area not zoned for it; shared alley is
inadequate for the proposed use;

9 2. Kent Sawatzky - Location chosen for project is not consistent with its current zoning;

10 Project has potential for unsightliness ("boarded-up appearance"); concerned with staff's

11 assertion that ethanol process is not a potential problem;
12 3. Shawn Studebaker - Concerned about odor; says the location is one of the worst possible

13 choices for the project, with the possible exception of locating the Project in the high

14 school gym; the concrete building is 100 years old, the 180 sq. ft. building in back was

15 not a septic tank but was an old ice house; he expressed concerns that ethanol extraction

16 will not be properly performed or could be switched to a more volatile medium after

17 approval;

18 4. Female Owner of house nearby - opposed to locating the project in downtown

19 Garberville; joined comments of Shawn Studebaker.

20 Testimony in the Record Establishes a Fair Argument

21 102. Even if the Department maintains its position that there is no expansion of use
22 from the issuance of the two (2) Special Permits allowing an industrial manufacturing and

23 distribution center in a small, mom-and-pop, light retail area, the record sets forth facts which

24 present a fair argument that there will be direct physical impacts to the environment from the

25 expansion of use from light retail to industrial manufacturing and distribution, and from a

26 traditional nine-to-five working day operation to a three-shift 24/7 operation.

27 103. Because a fair argument based on facts is in the record, as a matter of law, the

28 comments establish that there are "unusual circumstances" not associated with the existing uses

VERIFIED PETITION FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
WRIT OF MANDATE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 21

-

2 but with the expansion of the existing uses requested by the two (2) special permit applications,

3 and so the claimed categorical exemption cannot be used to avoid environmental review; either

4 an EIR or Negative Declaration must be conducted. See California Supreme Court and the First

5 District Court of Appeal decisions in Berkeley Hillside Preservation v. City of Berkeley, 60 Cal.

6 4th 1086 (2015) and San Francisco Beautiful v. City and County of San Francisco, 226 Cal.
App. 4th 1012 (2014).

7 Cumulative Impacts

8 104.

9 The Project proposes a 24/7 industrial manufacturing and distribution operation.

10 Given the proximity to the business above on the second floor, the residence on the third floor,

11 the zero setbacks to the adjacent businesses, together with the lack of being able to use the alley

12 past the Project site for ingress and egress, the proximity to three churches and a preschool, as

13 well as the location of residences clearly within three hundred (300) feet of the proposed Project,

14 there is fair argument that there may be direct and indirect physical impacts to the environment.

15 For instance, in the oral and written comments before the Planning Commission, neighboring

16 businesses and homeowners are concerned about: lighting and noise from a 24/7 enterprise and

17 parking restrictions both in the front of the building (only thirteen spaces for all businesses, for

18 which this proposed Project would take at least five) and the restricted parking in the alley in

19 back from the use of other property owners. Other direct physical impacts are the odors from this

20 major cannabis distribution center and manufacturing facility. There are fire and security

21 concerns: the fire department has urged denial due to dangers regarding the use and storage of

22 ethanol. There is no plan for how a fire truck could maneuver in the alley with parked cars from

23 other businesses especially during working days when vehicles are parked in the alley.
Testimony in the Record Establishes a Fair Argument

24 105. The record for the Project, both by the speakers at the Planning Commission
25 hearing and by those who submitted written comments, establishes that there are facts in this

26

27 record that present a fair argument that there may be direct impacts to the environment from the
project.

28 106. Because of this record, Respondents are required to conduct the formal

VERIFIED PETITION FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
WRIT OF MANDATE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 22

1 EIR/Negative Declaration process and not impose mitigation measures as conditions of approval.

2 Respondents' Mitigation Measures Establish Existence of a Fair Argument

3 107. The AIT and its use of conditions of approval to mitigate some of the direct

4 impacts from the a Project establish facts that a fair argument exists that there may be direct

5 impacts from the expansion of the existing use from light retail to add industrial manufacturing

6 and distribution.

7 108. When conditions of approval are imposed to mitigate environmental concerns of a

8 project, those conditions of approval, alone, negate the exemption. Only general conditions, e.g.,

9 follow all codes, or of conditions made after the exemption hearing to lessen the impact of
10 construction, are allowable.

11 109. If there are mitigation measures imposed as "conditions of approval" in

12 connection with the exemption process, then, as a matter of law, those mitigation measures must

13 proceed within the environmental review process of an EIR or Negative Declaration.

14 110. "Mitigation" includes the following:

15 (a) Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking a certain action or parts of an action.
16 (b) Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the action and its implementation.
17 (c) Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring the impacted environment.
18 (d) Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and

19 maintenance operations during the life of the action. (e) Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute resources or environments, including through permanent protection of such resources in the
20 form of conservation easements.

21 CEQA Guidelines § 15370.

22 111. There are sound reasons for precluding reliance upon mitigation measures at the

23 preliminary stage of determining eligibility for a categorical exemption. Regulatory guidelines

24 dealing with the environmental review process under CEQA contain elaborate standards-as

25 well as significant procedural requirements-for determining whether proposed mitigation will

26 adequately protect the environment and hence make an EIR unnecessary; in sharp contrast, the

27 guidelines governing preliminary review do not contain any requirements that expressly deal with

28 the evaluation of mitigation measures.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
WRIT OF MANDATE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 23

112. The Planning Department has imposed conditions of approval on this project.

2 Some are general and not connected to the exemption process, but some are absolutely site-

3 specific to offset concerns about the inappropriateness of the project site (e.g., installing odor
control mechanisms, moving the ethanol processing to a shed in the back of the building, and

5 approval of deliveries only during "normal business hours" without, however, a definition of
what "normal business hours" are.

113. The AIT alluded to an informal agreement by the Applicant, which is totally non-

8 enforceable, that the Applicant could possibly use smaller delivery trucks due to the size
limitations of the alley and lack of turn-around ability and loading.

10 114. The concerns raised by neighboring businesses and homeowners present facts that

11 a there is a fair argument that there may be direct impacts from the project. Those assertions of

12 facts by the neighboring businesses, home owners, the pastor, and the fire department voicing

13 specific environmental concerns of expanding the existing light retail use to industrial

14 manufacturing and distribution, especially when coupled with the Planning Departments'

15 "Conditions of Approval" imposed in connection with finding the "exemption", mandates that

16 this process stop now and that the Negative Declaration process be used. Ignoring the facts
17 presented by oral and written comments, coupled with the conditions of approval planning staff

18 has set in connection with finding an "exemption," and issuing the two special permits expanding

19 the use on site will only delay the inevitable.

20 Humboldt County Code Compliance Issues

21 115. The Planning Department has stated that, because the Project Applicant submitted

22 applications for the two special permits on December 28, 2016 (or prior to December 31, 2016),

23 that none of the current codified cannabis ordinance requirements apply.

24 116. The Department has stated that none of the requirements from what is referred to

25 as "Cannabis Ordinance 2.0" applies and that only what is in the now defunct "Cannabis

26 Ordinance 1.0" applies. A simple reading of the express wording of these ordinances contradicts

27 this assertion.

28 117. HCC section 314-55.4.3.1 states:

19 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

20 (Violation of CEQA - Failure to Adequately Evaluate and Adopt Feasible Alternatives)

21 148. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the paragraphs set forth above.

22 149. Respondents are required to consider and adopt feasible alternatives to

23 substantially lessen significant adverse effects on the environment. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002,
24 21002.1(a), 21100(b)(4); CEQA Guidelines § 15126(a). CEQA requires government agencies "to

25 consider alternatives to proposed actions affecting the environment." Pub. Res. Code § 21001(g).

26 150. "CEQA establishes a duty for public agencies to avoid or minimize environmental

27 damage where feasible." CEQA Guidelines § 15021(a); Pub. Res. Code §§ 21001, 21002.1.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
WRIT OF MANDATE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 29

manner required by law and did not support their approval of the Project with substantial

2 evidence because, not only did Respondents fail to identify potential impacts and fail to point out
where each of these potential impacts had been studied, Respondents also completely failed to
4 incorporate any and all feasible and prudent alternative or mitigation measures to substantially
reduce all significant adverse impacts on the environment. This resulted in a lack of any adequate
written analysis of feasible alternatives and any and all mitigation measures designed to reduce

7 the significant adverse environmental effects of the Project.

8 152. As a result of the defects discussed herein, Respondents prejudicially abused their

9 discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by law and did not support its approval of

10 the Applications by, among other things, not performing an adequate analysis, in violation of

VERIFIED PETITION FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
WRIT OF MANDATE AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF 30

157. As a result of the defects discussed herein, Respondents prejudicially abused their

2 discretion by making determinations and/or adopting findings that do not comply with the

3 requirements of CEQA and approving the Project in reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondents'
approval of the Project must be set aside.

5 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (Violation of CEQA - Failure to Adopt Adequate Mitigation Measures)

158. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the paragraphs set forth above.-

8 159. Public Resources Code § 21002 prohibits agencies to approve projects that have
significant impacts on the environment when feasible mitigation measures can substantially
10 lessen or avoid such impacts.

11 160. "A 'mitigation measure' is a suggestion or change that would reduce or minimize

12 significant adverse impacts on the enjoinment caused by the project as proposed." Sierra Club v.

13 County of San Diego, supra, at 1165, citing Lincoln Place Tenants Assn, supra, at 445.

14 161. An adequate EIR must describe mitigation measures that could feasibly
15| substantially reduce or avoid each identified significant effect. "If a mitigation measure would
16 cause one or more significant effects in addition that would be caused by the project as proposed,

17 the effects of the mitigation measure shall be discussed by in less detail than the significant

18 effects of the project as proposed." CEQA Guidelines 15126( c).

19 162. Relying on conclusory statements that there were no adverse environmental
20 impacts to mitigate, Respondents abused their discretion and failed to proceed in a manner

21 required by law in that it failed to adopt any adequate and/or effective mitigation measures for

NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of CEQA - Failure to Adopt Adequate Findings)

3 164. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the paragraphs set forth above.
4 165. To ensure that mitigation measures are considered and adopted, Public Resources
5 Code § 21081 and CEQA Guidelines §§ 15091, 15092 and 15093 require agencies to make
6 specific findings before they can approve projects with significant environmental effects.
7 Agencies cannot approve projects with significant environmental effects unless they find either
8 that such effects can be avoided or substantially lessened by adoption of mitigation measures or
9 |project alternatives; that other agencies with jurisdiction over the projects have adopted such
10 lalternatives or mitigation measures; or that mitigation measurers or alternative are infeasible due
11 to specific economic, social or other considerations.

12 166. "[T]he board of supervisors must make findings. . to permit a reviewing court to
13 bridge the analytic gap between the evidence and the ultimate decision."" (Citations omitted).

17 Council, 229 Cal. App. 3d 1011, 1037, fn. 17 (1991).

18 168. Respondents are required to determine that the Project has a significant impact
19 upon the environment if the project has the potential to achieve short-term environmental goals to
20 |the disadvantage of long-term environmental goals, or cause environmental effects which are
21 individually limited but cumulatively considerable. CEQA Guidelines § 15065(a)-(c).

22 169. If a project modification would not eliminate all significant impacts, Respondents
23 were required to issue a statement of overriding considerations regarding the Project if they could
24 not approve the Project or an alternative to the Project is not viable. CEQA Guidelines $ 15093.

25 170. Public comments submitted to Respondents, as set forth above, identify significant
26 adverse environmental impacts, which Respondents either ignored or glossed over the substance
27 of, with only conclusory responses that lack any factual support. These public comments identify
28 potential adverse environmental impacts related to the Project which are significant, and for which

VERIFIED PETITION FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE,
WRIT OF MANDATE AND INJUNCTIVE RFI IFF 20

1 there have not been any finding(s) of any overriding considerations with respect to the Project.

2 171. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion and failed to proceed in a manner
3 required by law. Respondents have not supported their decisions by substantial evidence or
4 otherwise, under CEQA Guidelines §§ 15091-15093, in that, among other things:

5 a. Respondents have failed to identify the significant environmental effects of the
6 Project and have approved the Project without making written findings for each of these
7 significant effects as required by CEQA Guidelines section 15091;

8 b. Respondents approved the Project without eliminating or substantially lessening all
9 significant effects on the environment where feasible, nor determining that remaining significant
10 effects on the environment are acceptable due to overriding concerns as required by CEQA
11 Guidelines section 15092; and

12 C. Respondents have failed to issue a statement of overriding considerations with its
13 approval of the Project as required by CEQA Guidelines section 15093.

14 172. Because of the numerous, significant, or presumptively significant impacts
15 enumerated herein, Respondents were required to devise specific, concrete mitigation measures or
16 alternatives which would substantially reduce or avoid those impacts. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002,
17 21081; CEQA Guidelines § 15091.

18 173. Respondents have breached their duties and prejudicially abused their discretion
19 land failed to proceed according to law in its failure to devise and require mitigation measures,
20 alternatives, and adopt findings and a statement of overriding considerations.

23 Hearing Before Planning Commission)

24 174. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the paragraphs set forth above.

2 lofficials thus allowing for appropriate action come election day should a majority of the voters
3 disagree." CEQA Guidelines § 15003(e).

4 176. Because of Respondents' actions, the Project's potential environmental impacts
5 identified by the Public, as well as its cumulative impacts, must therefore be considered
6 "*significant" due to the fact that Respondents have failed to adequately address them. Nor have
7 /Respondents successfully mitigated the impacts of the Project in the manner or to the extent
8 required by law.

177. Respondents did not proceed according to law and have not supported their
10 decisions by substantial evidence. As such, Respondents have prejudicially abused their
11 discretion.

13 manner required by law because Respondents did not issue adequate evaluations and responses to
14 environmental concerns raised by public comment that provided, among other things, a response
15 to significant environmental concerns raised by the public comment. These concerns include but
16 lare not limited to the environmental impacts set forth herein.

17 ELEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

19 179. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the paragraphs set forth above.

20 180. CEQA requires that whenever an agency finds that potential adverse impacts exist
21 which can be mitigated, it is required to adopt a mitigation monitoring program "designed to
22 ensure 'compliance during project implementation™" to ensure that the mitigation measures are
23 followed. Pub. Res. Code § 21081.6; see also Sierra Club v. County of San Diego, supra, at 1165.

24 181. Respondents have prejudicially abused their discretion because, in addition to
25 failing to identify adequate mitigation measures to the Project, Respondents failed to adopt legally

Re: Notice of Intent to File Suit Under the California Environmental Quality

Director John Ford:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE THAT, under Public Resources Code § 21167.5, that
petitioner, Craig Lehman ("Petitioner"), intends a to file a petition' under the provision of
the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code sections 21000 et
seq. ("CEQA")) against the County of Humboldt; Humboldt County Board of

1 Harland Law Firm, LLP has been retained to, and will, file a Verified Petition for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, or in the alternative a Writ of Mandate and Injunctive Relief
(*Petition").

Supervisors; Humboldt County Planning Commission ("Planning Commission");
Humboldt County Planning Department (*Planning Department"); and Humboldt
County Planning Director, John Ford (*Planning Director"),? challenging the action of
the Humboldt County Planning Commission's ("Planning Commission") in its
December 5, 2019, approval of Special Permit Application Numbers PLN-12733-SP and
PLN-12747-SP' (the "Applications").

Among other issues, Petitioner will allege that Respondents failed to proceed in a
manner required by law, including without limitation, the approval of the Applications
based on the Planning Department's assertion that these Applications "were exempt from environmental review per Cal. Code Regs., tit 14, section 15201 (Existing
Facilities) and 15303 (New Construction or Conversion of Small Structures) of the
California Environmental Quality (CEQA) Guidelines," and, in addition, on what
appears to be an abandonment by the County of Petitioner's appeal to the Board under Humboldt County Code section 312-13, et seq., of the Planning Commission's approval
of the Applications.

In order for Respondents to bring themselves in compliance with the law, a
CEQA process, including without limitation, an environmental impact report ("EIR") would be required because of the inability to find with certainty that activities
associated with the Applications will not have a significant effect on the environment.
See CEQA Guidelines § 15061(b)(3).

The petition being filed will seek the following relief:
1. For a stay pending trial of Respondents' decisions approving the Project;
2. For a declaration of Respondents' duties in regard to Petitioner's appeal of
the Project to the Board and/or the Project.
3. For a declaration that said actions by the Planning Commission approving
the Project are null and void due to the fact that they are an non-elected

2 These parties are hereinafter collectively referred to as "Respondents."

3 The Agenda Item Transmittal submitted by the Planning Director to the Planning Commission for its December 5, 2019, meeting ("AIT"), at page 2 describes the location of the two applications as "located in the Garberville area, on the East side of Redwood Drive, approximately 80 feet north from the intersection of Sprowel Creek Road and Redwood Drive, on the property known as 829 Redwood Drive," with a Humboldt County Assessor's Parcel Number of 032-051-
032.

4. For a declaration that the Commercial Cannabis Ordinance does apply to
the Project.
5. For a declaration that the record shows substantial evidence that a Fair
Argument exists that the Project may have a significant effect on the
environment.
6. In addition to declaratory relief, that this court issue a peremptory writ of
mandate ordering:
a. Respondents to vacate and set aside its decisions approving the
Project;
b. Respondents to suspend all activity for the Project using a
Categorical Exemption since the approval expands the existing use of the facility from light retail to industrial/distribution.
C That if Respondents wish to go forward with the Project that
Respondents prepare and circulate an Initial Study pursuant to
CEQA studying the impacts which could result in a change or alteration to the physical environment; and
7. For an interlocutory and permanent injunction directing Respondents and
all Real Parties in Interest to cease and refrain from engaging in any and
all activities in furtherance of the Project unless and until Respondents
and all Real Parties in Interest take all necessary steps to bring their
actions into compliance with CEQA.
8. For costs of suit herein incurred;
9. As to all Causes of Action, for attorney fees incurred by Petitioner in
prosecuting the instant action as allowed by California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1021.5 and/or any other applicable provision(s) of law;
and
9. For such other and further relief as the court may deem proper.
A copy of the petition to be filed by the Petitioner is attached to this notice.
