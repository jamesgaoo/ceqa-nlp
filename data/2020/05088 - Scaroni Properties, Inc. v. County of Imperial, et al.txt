VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 Petitioner Scaroni Properties, Inc. (*Petitioner") files this Verified Petition for Writ of
Mandate and Alleges as follows:

3 INTRODUCTION

4

5 1. This action challenges the August 11, 2020 decision of the COUNTY OF IMPERIAL by

6 and through the IMPERIAL COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS ("County," "Board" or

ã 7 "Respondent") to approve the EI Toro Export expansion/Zone Change #18-0006 and certify the

Imperial Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 09-11-2020 at 08:42:30 * 8 Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") (*Project"). The Project allows the expansion of the cattle

9 facility from 17,000 to 34,000 cattle in the immediate vicinity of farmland and within the immediate

10 vicinity of the City of Heber and the Project relocates the compost areas to an unknown location.

11 Respondents' approval was in violation of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"),
Public Resources Code § 21000 et seq., the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14 California Code of
12| Regulations, § 15000 et seq., and the State Planning and Zoning Law, Government Code § 65300 et
13 seq. and Imperial County Ordinances.

14

15 2. Respondents prepared and relied on an MND that falls well below CEQA's minimum

standards.

16

17 3. The MND also failed to adequately analyze the significant impacts to the environment

18 including the impacts to surrounding agricultural land, cumulative impacts, increased impacts from

19 composting operations, impacts to change in compost site, impacts of odor to human health, failure

20 to analyze or adopt mitigation measures to reduce air quality odor and greenhouse gas emissions,

21 failure to address environmental justice impacts and failure to include numeric thresholds to
greenhouse gas emissions.

22

23 4. The Project violated state law and local ordinances by not providing notice of the MND to

24 the surrounding landowners, not posting the notice at the courthouse, failing to include relevant

25 backup documents including a comment letter and the text of the Conditional Zone Change being

26 changed at the hearing, failing to provide adequate background regarding the "No Growth Allowed"

27 condition (based on statements that the County lost the entire audio/video), failing to analyze or

28 comply with the "No Growth Allowed" condition, failing to adopt adequate findings and failing to
comply with the County's Specific Plan and General Plan.

2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 5. The Project eliminates a 2007 Conditional Zone Change that had 34 separate
2 conditions/limitations required of the cattle yard to a statutory Zone A3 with no conditions. The
3

4 Board of Supervisors eliminated those 34 conditions without having access to and without reviewing
those 34 2007 conditions as required by

5 CEQA, State laws and local County Ordinances. Those

6 conditions were not provided to the public, the Environmental Evaluation Committee, the Planning

& 7 Commission or the Board of Supervisors. In fact, only part of one condition was included in the

Imperial Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 09-11-2020 0E 7t:80 8 backup, leaving out critical restrictions placed on the 2007 cattle yard.
6. Petitioner

9 request that this Court vacate and set aside the Project and related approvals and

* the certification of the MND because Respondents failed to comply with CEQA, applicable State
10 Planning and Zoning Laws and Imperial County Ordinances.
11

12 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
7. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure
13 sections 1085, 1094.5, 187, and 526 and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5. This
14 Court has the authority to issue a writ of mandate

15 directing the County to vacate and set aside its

16 approval of the Project and certification of the MND for the Project under the Code of Civil
Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5.

17

18 8. Venue for this action properly lies in the Imperial County Superior Court because
Respondents and the Project are located in Imperial County.

19 THE PARTIES

20

21 9. Petitioner, SCARONI PROPERTIES, INC. ("Scaroni" or "Petitioner"), is a California
corporation that is owned by Linda Rossi and Steve Scaroni. Scaroni owns and manages land
22 immediately abutting the Project. Scaroni has approximately 250 acres and a residence in the

13 18. Petitioner submitted comments on the Project which identified the legal inadequacies of

14 the material and pointed to the MND's inadequate analysis of the Project's impacts and the failure to
adopt feasible mitigation measures to reduce Project's impacts. Such comments include, but are not
15 limited to:

16

17 a) Failure to analyze cumulative impacts from related projects, such as the project site's

18 current 18,000-head cattle operation with composting operations approved in 2007;

19 b) Failure to analyze impacts from increase composting operations resulting from the 17,000-
head increase;

20

3 environmental impacts suffered by the surrounding community;
4 h) Failure to translate human health effects from project impacts to air quality, odors, and
5 GHG emissions, such as to those near the Project Site; and

6 i) Failure to apply numeric thresholds to GHG emissions.
ã 7 19. On August 11, 2020, the Board held a public hearing to consider the Project. During this
0E 7+:80 8 hearing numerous members of the public including the owners of Petitioner and Petitioner's counsel
9 addressed the legal inadequacies set forth herein. At this August 11, 2020 meeting, the Project was
* 10 approved. This hearing was conducted during the California Governor's COVID-19 Stay at Home unoo Jouedns jeuedwj Accepted through eDelivery submitted 09-11-2020 11 Order.

2 attached as Exhibit C.

3 24. This petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167 and

4 CEQA Guideline section 15112.

5 25. Respondents have abused their discretion and failed to act as required by law in the

6 following ways:
& 7 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
Imperial Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 09-11-2020 08:42:30 8 (VIOLATION OF CEQA; MND Does Not Comply With CEQA)
9 26. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth above.
* 10 27. CEQA requires a lead agency for a project to prepare an environmental review document
11 that complies with the requirements of the statute. The lead agency must also provide for public
12 review and comment on the project and associated environmental documentation. The environmental
13 document must provide sufficient environmental analysis such that decision-makers can intelligently
14 consider environmental consequences when acting on proposed projects.
15 28. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying an MND for the Project that is inadequate and
16 fails to comply with CEQA. Among other things, Respondents:

17 a) Failed to analyze cumulative impacts from related projects, such as the project site's
18 current 18,000-head cattle operation with composting activities approved in 2007'
19 b) Failed to analyze impacts from increase composting operations resulting from the 17,000-

20 head increase;

21 c) Failed to analyze impacts from increase composting operations at the Project Site prior to

22 start of Phase 2 when the composting yard is to be relocated;

23 d) Failed to analyze impacts upon relocation of the composting yard, which will have
24 additional mobile emissions and localized impacts;

25 e) Failed to translate human health effects of odor impacts;

26 f) Failed to incorporate feasible mitigation measures to further reduce air quality, odor, and
27 GHG emission impacts;

28

7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 g) Failed to consider the unique environmental setting of this environmental justice

3 community, which would demand more stringent thresholds to avoid further exacerbation of

4 environmental impacts suffered by the surrounding community;

5 h) Failed to translate human health effects from project impacts to air quality, odors, and
GHG emissions, such as to those near the Project Site;

6

ã 7 i) Failed to apply numeric thresholds to GHG emissions; and

Imperial Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 08:7+:80 1e OZOZ-LL-60 8 j) Failed to analyze the increased traffic, impacts to the roads, impact of the daily trips and
increased need for employees or services.
9 29. The Agriculture and Forest Resources section is marked in the Initial Study as "Less
10 Than Significant Impact." The reason given is that the land is in agriculture and is remaining in
11

12 agriculture. This is misleading and fails analyze the significant difference between a grass crop and a

13 cattle feedlot. The County's land use designation is different between grass crops and a cattle feedlot. a

14 Simply stating that the land will be in the general category of agriculture is insufficient. Further,
there is no analysis on the surrounding uses which will be removing the ability to utilize the land for
15 organic crops or fruit and vegetable crops. It has been proven that the recent E.coli outbreaks that
16

17 have sickened thousands and in some cases caused deaths, were caused by animals. Major buyers

18 such as McDonalds, Yum Brands and many other buyers of leafy greens who supply grocery,

19 foodservice and schools, all require a minimum 1-mile buffer radius of any cattle feedlot operation.

20 Some retail and food service retailers have created internal protocols that call for a 2-mile buffer as

21 an added precaution. Expanding a feedlot, given these limitations on fruit and vegetable production,

22 significantly impacts neighboring agriculture by limiting not only the crops that can be grown, but

23 the value of land for local owners as a result. This impact on agriculture and health was not analyzed
by the Board.

24 29. The appropriate environmental analysis should have been an Environmental Impact
25 Report ("EIR") rather than an MND.

26

27 30. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by

28 certifying an MND that does not comply with CEQA and by approving the Project in reliance

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 thereon. Accordingly, Respondents' certification of the MDN and approval of the Project must be set
aside.

3

4 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (VIOLATIONS OF CEQA; Inadequate Findings)

6 31. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth above.

ã 32. CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be supported by

Imperial Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 09-11-2020 at 08:42:30 7 substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA further requires that a lead agency provide
8

9 an explanation of how evidence in the record supports the conclusions it has reached.
33. The entire resolution is less than two pages. It simply states that "The [sic] finds and
10 determines that the Mitigated Negative Declaration is adequate and was prepared in accordance with
11 the requirements of the Imperial County General Plan, Land Use Ordinance and the California
12 Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), with analyses [sic] environmental effects, based upon the
13 following findings and determinations:

14

15 1. That the recital set forth herein are true, correct and valid; and

16 2. That the Board of Supervisors has reviewed the attached Mitigated Negative Declaration

17 for Zone Change #18-0006 and considered the information contained in the Mitigated

18 Negative Declaration together with all comments received during the public review period

19 and prior to approving the Zone Change #18-006; and

20 3. That the mitigated Negative Declaration reflects the Board of Supervisors independent
judgment and analysis."

21

22 34. Despite a request by Petitioner that the Board make findings (even orally) and provide

23 reasoning or address the matters raised by Petitioner and the public, the Board adopted the findings

24 above that fail to address numerous issues raised during the public hearing and that contain no

25 analysis or relevant conclusions. Significantly, the findings do not address the numerous conditions

26 that were eliminated in the approval because those were not reviewed or analyzed by the Board. The

27 findings do not address the 2007 condition language that states "This will be based on the current

28 number of corrals, size of corrals and footprint of the operation, being 148 corrals." The limitation
on corrals should have been addressed in the findings.

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-.

1

2 35. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter of law
in that they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including, but not limited to, the
3 determination that an MND is appropriate because it was determined that mitigation measures

4 are

5 available to reduce these significant effects to insignificant levels.

6

ã 7 36. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by

Jouedns jeuedwj Court Accepted 08:7t:80 1e 0ZOZ-LL-60 pegjugns fuesjjege ybnouup 8 adopting findings that do not comply with the requirements of CEQA and approving the Project in

9 reliance thereon. Accordingly, Respondents' certification of the MND and approval of the Project
must be set aside.

10 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (VIOLATION OF CEQA; Deferred Mitigation or Piecemealing)

12 37. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth above.
38. Respondents failed to analyze the impacts of the entire Project. The Project approvals
13 given on August 11, 2020 authorize a compost yard to be placed at an unknown location. This is
14

15

16 either an approval without any environmental analysis or mitigation. Alternatively, this is breaking a
project approval into two parts which is "piecemealing" and a violation of CEQA.

17 39. By failing to either analyze the future compost yard, or to break up the compost yard
from the current Project approval, Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law.
18 Accordingly, Respondents' certification of the MND and approval of the Project must be set aside.

19

20 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (VIOLATION OF CEQA; Inadequate Response to Comments)

22 40. Petitioner hereby incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth above.

23

24 41. Respondents failed to respond adequately to comments submitted by the Petitioner, other
members of the public, and other agencies. Instead, very brief responses were given on the record
that failed to address the agricultural impacts, air quality, odor, greenhouse gases, environmental
25 justice and other impacts of the Project.

26

27

28 42. By failing to provide adequate responses to public comments and proposed alternatives,
Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law.
FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

(Violations of State Planning and Zoning Law)

2 43. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth above.

3 44. Government Code section 65300 requires the legislative body of each county to adopt a
4 general plan for the physical development of the area. The general plan is a guidance document for

5 future development to which all other land use decisions must conform. Accordingly, any decision of
6 the County affecting land use and development, including issuance of a zone change, must be
& 7 consistent with the general plan, Neighborhood Action Group v. County of Calaveras (1984) 156
08:Z7:80 le 0ZOZ-LL-60 pamiwqns uenjege Imperial Superior Court Accepted through 8 Cal.App.3d 1176, 1182-86.

9 45. The Project is inconsistent with the Imperial County General Plan and the Heber Urban
10 Area Plan because the proposed feedlot will conflict with numerous Imperial County General Plan
11 Agricultural Element objectives, including but not limited to:
12 a) Maintain existing agricultural land uses outside of urbanizing areas and allow only those
13 land uses in agricultural areas that are compatible with agricultural activities;
14 b) Discourage the location of development adjacent to productive agricultural lands;
15 c) Recognize and preserve unincorporated areas of the County outside of city sphere of
16 influence areas, for irrigation agriculture, livestock production, aquaculture, and other special
17 uses;

18 d) Provide policies and/or incentives for continued use of farmland located just beyond the
19 urban boundaries to ensure the stability that enables farmers to invest and reinvest in

20 agricultural production on their land;

21 e) Provide policies and/or incentives for continued use of farmland located just beyond the

22 urban boundaries to ensure the stability that enables farmers to invest and reinvest in

23 agricultural production on their land; and

24 f) Encourage the production of labor intensive crops such as vegetables.

25 46. The second finding related to the zone change states "The Zone Change is consistent with
26 the General Plan's underlying land use designation of the SPA Heber. The Zone Change will allow
27 for the expansion of an existing feed-lot operation." This is an inadequate finding. In fact, the current
28

11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 zone states "No Additional Growth." If the underlying zoning has a provision that does not allow

3 this, with findings supporting the prohibition of growth, this finding cannot be made.

4 47. The Project is also inconsistent with the Imperial County General Plan because the

5 proposed feedlot will conflict with the following, including but not limited to: requiring the

6 mitigation of significant impacts to air quality, odor, greenhouse gas, environmental justice impacts
and human health effects.

& 7

Imperial Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 09-11-2020 at 08:42:30 8 48. The 2007 Conditional Zone Change states that "Permitee will not operate or allow any
type of use other than specified herein and within the Application. . Permitee understands and will
9 abide by each and every one of the conditions set forth in this Agreement in exchange for the
10

11 County's approval of the requested zone change from 'A2' Medium Agriculture to Heavy

12 Agriculture 'A3.' The document also states that "the composting facility absent special conditions

13 and restrictions could be incompatible in some respects with surrounding uses" (emphasis added).

14 The findings adopted on the August 11, 2020 approval do not address how this incompatibility is
resolved without special conditions.

15

16 49. The Project was not properly noticed in the public notice which was mailed to the

17 neighboring properties because the notices failed to reference the approval of the MND. There were

18 only two actions being considered by the Board and one of the two was left out of the notice.

19 Consistent with the requirement to include the MND in Board agendas, the notification to the public
must also include notification of consideration of the MND approval. San Joaquin Raptor Rescue
20 Center v. County of Merced (2013) 216 Cal. App. 4th 1167, 1177-1178. This case states that "The
21

22 adoption of the MND was plainly a distinct item of business, and not a mere component of project

23 approval, since it (1) involved a separate action or determination by the Commission and (2)

24 concerned discrete, significant issues of CEQA compliance and the project's environmental impact.

25 As an individual item of business, it had to be expressly disclosed on the agenda; it was not

26 sufficient for the agenda to merely reference the project in general." California Government Code

27 section 65094 requires that the zone change notice include "a general explanation of the matter to be

28 considered." The MND is one of two matters being considered and was excluded from the mailed
public notice. Further, failure to properly inform the public is violation of the policy set forth in

12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 California Government Code section 65033 which states "The Legislature recognizes the importance

2 of public participation at every level of the planning process. It is therefore the policy of the state
3 and the intent of the Legislature that each state, regional, and local agency concerned in the planning
4 process involve the public through public hearings, informative meetings, publicity and other means
5 available to them, and that at such hearings and other public forums, the public be afforded the

6 opportunity to respond to clearly defined alternative objectives, policies, and actions."
& 7 50. The first finding states that "The proposed Zone Change has been analyzed relative to its
submitted 09-11-2020 at 08:42:30 Imperial Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery 8 potential to be detrimental to the health, safety, comfort and welfare of the persons residing or
9 working within the neighborhood of the proposed Zone Change. Staff concluded that the project
10 does not propose land uses, densities, or development patterns that will jeopardize the health and
11 safety of the persons residing or working within the neighborhood of the property. Health, safety,
12 and welfare will not be degraded as a result of this project." This statement is not accurate. There is
13 no analysis presented. The original, Conditional Zone Change made an opposite finding, that the
14 only way it could be compatible was with a "No Additional Growth" provision. The immediate
15 surrounding land use has remained the same. The land use in Heber has become more dense and

16 more populated since 2007. Further, the sphere of influence, general plan and other County

17 documents do not support this conclusion.

18 51. The second finding states "The Zone Change is consistent with the General Plan's
19 underlying land use designation of the SPA Heber. The Zone Change will allow for the expansion of
20 an existing feed-lot operation." This is an inadequate finding. In fact, the current zone states "No
21 Additional Growth." If the underlying zoning has a provision that does not allow this, with findings
22 supporting the prohibition of growth, this finding cannot be made.

23 52. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents did not proceed in the manner required
24 by law, and their decision to approve the Project was not supported by substantial evidence.
25 Accordingly, approval of the Project must be set aside.

26 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

27 (Violations of County of Imperial Ordinances and Agreements)
28 53. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth above.

13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

r 54. The Project is subject to the notice provisions of the Imperial County Ordinances. Section

2 90204.07 requires notice of an Imperial County Board of Supervisors' zoning hearing. The notice of

3 the zoning hearing must be consistent with Section 90104.03(c). Section 90104.03 states that "[t]he

4 department shall strictly adhere to the following noticing requirement: ... Posting the commission

5 agenda at both the Courthouse and Administration Center at least ten (10) days prior to hearing." The
6 Courthouse posting was not done for this Project.
ã 7 55. The backup given to the Board and the public did not include the 2007 Conditional Zone
unoo Jouedns jeuedwi 08:77:80 1e ozOZ-l1-60 pomlugns ueajege ußnouu paideooy % 8 Change that had 34 separate conditions placed on the Project to a statutory Zone A3. The Board of
9 Supervisors eliminated those 34 conditions without having access to and without reviewing those
10 conditions as required by CEQA, State laws and local County Ordinances. Those conditions were
11 not provided to the public, the Environmental Evaluation Committee, the Planning Commission or
12 the Board. Further, the conditional zone change is not available to the public either in the ordinance
13 or online for review. Petitioner requested that the 2007 tape be provided for review, but the County
14 lost the audio or video recording. Petitioner submitted a letter from a former Board member

15 outlining the background of the 2007 meeting, but failed to provide any paperwork, minute orders or
16 other references to the 2007 meeting which was critical to the hearing.

17 56. County Ordinance 90204.02 states that "Any change of zone shall only be considered if it
18 can be found consistent with the county's general plan." As set forth above, this zone change is not

19 consistent with the County's general plan.

20 57. County Ordinance 90204.07 states that "The board of supervisors shall not consider,
21 approve or deny a change of zone unless proper notice has been provided and a public hearing is

22 conducted." The County failed to include the MND in the notice, the County failed to post at the
23 Courthouse and the County failed to include the current zone in the backup and therefore
24 Respondents should not have even heard the matter.

25 58. County Ordinance 90204.10 authorizes a conditional zone change to include an

26 agreement to implement conditions or restrictions, limitation of use(s) beyond those established, or
27 permitted in the zone, limitation to specific project; mitigation measures. The 2007 condition of "No
28 Growth Allowed" is a restriction, limitation or mitigation measure which cannot be changed in the

14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1

2 current hearing. The public had no notification or explanation of the 2007 restrictiona and their
meaning based on what Respondents' published or voted upon.

3

4 59. The Project was bound by the 2007 "No Growth Allowed" provision which authorized

5 the compost yard only in exchange a for a legal agreement not to expand. The approval was an attempt

6 to circumvent the conditions set forth in the Conditional A3 zone. The County's own document has

ã 7 already found an expansion will "be incompatible in some respects with surrounding uses." The

Imperial Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 09-11-2020 at 08:42:30 surrounding uses have not changed since 2007 and by the County's own 2007 admission, the use is
8| incompatible. In fact, the surrounding uses in Heber include more homes and therefore have more

9 impacts and are even more clearly incompatible now.

10 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

11 WHEREFORE, the Petitioner prays for relief as follows:

12

13 1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate, commanding Respondents:

14 (A) to vacate and set aside approval of the Project;

15 (B) to vacate and set aside certification of the MND for the Project;

16 (C) to prepare and certify a legally adequate EIR for the Project; and

17 (D) to suspend any and all activity pursuant to Respondents' approval of the Project

18 that could result in an adverse charge or alteration to the physical environment until

19 Respondents have complied with all requirements of CEQA and all other applicable

20 state and local laws, policies, ordinances and regulations as directed by this Court
pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21168.9.

21

22 2. For a stay, temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent injunction

23 prohibiting any actions by Respondents pursuant to Respondents' approval of the Project and

24 certification of the MND for the Project until Respondents have fully complied with all requirements

25 of CEQA. Planning and Zoning Laws and all other applicable state and local laws, policies,
ordinances, and regulations;

26 3. For costs of the suit;

27

28 4. For attorney's fee pursuant to the Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5; and

§ Imperial Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 09-11-2020 at 08:42:30 P 940 W. Main Street, Suite 209 El Centro, CA 92243-2839
Board Tel: (442) 265-1030
Clerk Tel: (442) 265-1020 Fax: (442) 265-1027

Dear Board of Supervisors,

I vigorously oppose the El Toro Cattle & Feed expansion that is scheduled to be heard by*
your Board of Supervisors ("Board") on August 11,2020. This is a project that doubles the head
of cattle:- from 17,000 to 34,000 - and has devastating impacts to neighboring farms and the
Heber and El Centro communities. These communities are already suffering from substandard
air quality (as recognized by this Board in its AB 617 materials) and this project adds
significantly to the poor air quality. I have heard this Board talk for years about the importance
of improving air quality at thé Salton Sea and the air quality and pollution at the Now River, yet, ::
with approval of this project, you are voluntarily adding to that problem in direct opposition to .: : E:
the positions you have taken to help your citizens. As set forth more fully below, the County of
Imperial has failed to provide backup, has failed to honestly represent the project, has failed to
do a full environmental review and has pushed this illegal expansion through the approval
process during a time that your Board has issued a. Stay at Home Order due to COVID. In. i ::
addition to the impact on surrounding farmers like myself, I hope you will not approve this
project as it will halt growth of the Heber and El Centro communities

101 East Main St., Heber, CA 92249
95001 P.O. Box 96, Aptos, CA

To be clear, I am formally requesting that the Board grant a continuance of this project to
a later date. Alternatively, I am requesting that the Board send this matter back to the Planning
Commission for further review consistent with Board direction to address the matters set forth-
below.

ã Imperial Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 09-11-2020 at 08:42:30 F = g 1. There Are Numerous Procedural Errors that Legally Mandate this Matter be
Continued or Remanded to the Planning Commission for Further Review.

a. The County of Imperial Failed to Post Notice of the Project at the Courthouse, Imperial
County Code section 90104.03 states "The department shall strictly adhere to-the
following noticing requirement: Posting the commission agenda at both the
Courthouse and Administration Center at least ten (10) days prior to hearing."* Section D
also says the same noticing shall be used for Board of Supervisors hearings. There was no
posting at the Courthouse which was raised with the County CEO, Clerk of the Board and
County Counsel. last week. Despite providing this information to your staff, the County
Counsel states he is unaware of this provision and did not respond timely to my counsel
related to this matter. The strict adherence to your own ordinance should necessitate
temand or continuance.

b. Failure to Include the Environmental Approval in the Mailed Notice. The County of
Imperial sent notices to landowners without any mention of the fact that there would be
no Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"), but instead, would be a Mitigated Negative
Declaration ("MND"). While your Board did send notice to the newspaper and your
Boärd of Supervisors" agenda mentions the MND; the notice to the most important, and
most vulnerable citizens had no mention of the MND. This is a violation of the law which
exists to help landowners and the public know what actions the Board is taking. San
Joaquin Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced, 216 Cal. App. 4th 1167, 1177-1178
states the following:

We are further persuaded of the correctness of this conclusion by the fact that a
public agency's decision whether to adopt or certify a CEQA document (such as a

# negative declaration, MND or an BIR) is always a matter of at least potential

08:42:30 public interest since it would concern the local environmental effects of a
proposed project. Such issues often motivate members of the public to participate

§ in the process and have their voices heard. Of course, that is exactly what the

Imperial Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 09-11-2020 Brown Act seeks to facilitate. Its purposes include ensuring that the public is
adequately notified of what will be addressed at a meeting in order to facilitate
public participation and avoid secret legislation or decision making. (§ 54950; Los
Augeles Times Communications v. Los Angeles County Bd. of Supervisors,
supra, 112 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1321-1322.) Those purposes would be impaired if
a public agency could refuse to disclose in its meeting agenda that it will be
considering approval of a CEQA document. Such an approach would allow a
potentially controversial issue to be quietly proposed and decided without having
to open the discussion to meaningful public input. That is one of the evils the
Brown Act was designed to prevent. (§ 54950; see Epstein, supra, 87 Cal.App.4th
at p. 869 [the Brown Act is construed liberally to accomplish its remedial
•purposes].)

C. Failure to include the Conditional Zone Change (the 2007 document) in the Backup. The
County is changing : •2007 Conditional A-3 Zone to a regular A-3 Zone tomorrow. The
County did not include the 2007 Conditional A-3 Zone change in the backup of the EEC,
the Planning Commission or the Board of Supervisors. Further, the County of Imperial
Ordinance incorrectly states that this zone is A-3. The public cannot address this issue
without the A-3 Conditional Zone paperwork,

d. Failure to Properly Address the 2007 "No Growth Allowed" Condition. The County
backup summarizes the 2007 "No Growth Allowed" provision, but leaves out the most
important sentence. The backup states:

NO GROWTH ALLOWED: This zone change does not in any way allow the: :
existing feedlot operation to expand from its current size."

There is no mention by the County of the most critical sentence which states. "This will

É Imperial Superiör Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 09-11-2020 at 08:42:30 P be based on the current number of corrals, size of corrals and footprint of the operation,
being 148 corrals." The limitation on corrals is absolutely relevant, necessary and critical
to have in the backup for the community to review and this line was omitted.
e. The Lost 2007 Audio Recording. The zone change is absolutely, 100% dependent on
what took place during the 2007 zone change and the "No Growth Allowed" conditions
placed on that change. My legal counsel, Katherine Turner häs requested the recording of
the 2007 hearing and has been told the County lost the recording. My legal counsel,
Katherine Turner has reached out to the förmer Clerk of the Board of Supervisors and
have learned that there should be an audio recording and a backup of that recording. The.
County has clearly stated that the recording no longer exists. My legal counsel,
Katherine Turner has volunteered to pay for an IT expert to assist in retrieving the
recording, in an effort to help the Board hear this critical evidence, and have been denied.
In order to provide perspective, my legal counsel Katherine Turner is submitting into the
record an email from former Supervisor Gary Wyatt which has been submitted to the
County to assist in information in light of the fact that the 2007 hearing evidence has
been spoiled. As you can see, the "No Growth Allowed" provision was a significant
factor in the approval.

f The Missing Heber Public Utility District (HPUD") Letter. HPUD submitted a letter
dated March 19, 2020 which should have been considered by the Environmental
Evaluation Commission ("EEC) and the Planning Commission ("PC"). Planning
Commissioner Max Castillo asked about this letter at the Plänning Commission and there
was still no mention of this critical letter. No one read the letter into the record. No one
provided details regarding the concerns raised in the letter. Your Board packet is dated
received by the CEO's office on July 24, 2020, yet this letter was added only after the

Planning Department stamped the document received on July 29, 2020. Without
stamping the backup as "Revised," this letter was added at the last minute. Failure to
include the most important agency's comments in EEC and PC review is reason enough
to send this matter back to the Planning Commission or continue the matter:

Imperial Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 09-11-2020 at 08:42:30 PN g. This Project was Environmentally Analyzed. Approved by the Planning Commission and
is Scheduled for Board Approval in Violation of the Governor's Stay at Home Order and
Should be Delaved. The County of Imperial has had some of the highest and
non-compliant COVID-19 numbers in the State of California. Since March, except for a
few weeks, the County of Imperial has been required to comply with strict stay at homé
orders. Yet, during this lockdown, the BEC met and approved a MND, the Planning
Commission iet and approved the same and the County Board of Supervisors is
scheduled to approve this project as well. This project in 2007 was extremely
controversial and had significant citizen involvement. This project approval should be:
delayed based solely upon the stay at home order to allow adequate time and opportunity
for those in Heber to participate. The elderly in this area do not have access to internet.
The notice and backup is not available online to even analyze. It is unfair to request
citizens show up at the County building to risk their health in order to participate. In fact,
the County of Imperial web site states that the Planninig Department is closed to the
public and only open with an appointment. There is almost no waÿ to access these
documents and meaningfully participate. Additionally, only County essential workers are
working. It is hard to understand, without adequate reasons provided, how this approval,
which has been planned for several years is an essential project that requires County stäff
to turn away from emergency work to complete.

I The Failure to Properly Analyze the 2007 "No Growth Allowed" Restriction is a
Violation of CEQA and a Violation of the Imperial County Title 9 Ordinances
In 2007, the County of Imperial approved the El Toro Land & Cattle Agreement for
Conditional Zone Change #06-001 Ifor APNs 054-250-014-001 and 054-250-012-001. This
document clearly states that "Permitee will not operate or allow any type of use other than

specified herein and within the Application. Permitee understands and will abide by each and
every one of the conditions set forth in this Agreement in exchange for the County's approval of
the requested zone change from 'A2' Medium Agriculture to Heavy Agriculture 'A3.' The
document even admits that "the composting facility absent special conditions and restrictions

È could be incompatible in some respects with surrounding uses." Condition S17 states the
following:

Imperial Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 09-11-2020 at 08:42:30 | "NO GROWTH ALLOWED:
This zone change does not in anyway allow the existing feedlot operation to
expand from its current size. This will be based on the current number of corrals,
size of corrals and footprint of the operation, being 148 corrals."
The approval being presented is in direct contradiction to the binding document. The only
reason the compost project was authorized in 2007 was with a binding, legal agreement to not
expand. El Toro Land & Cattle Co. exccuted this agreement as did the County of Imperial in
July of 2007,
El Toro Land & Cattle Co. has a current, conditional zone of A3. This conditional zone
requires no more expansion. The entire application is an attempt to circumvent the conditions set
forth in the Conditional A3 zone. The County's own document has already found an expansion
will "be incompatible in some respects with surrounding uses." The surrounding uses have not
changed since 2007 and by the County's own admission, the use is incompatible. In fact, the
surrounding uses in Heber include more homes and therefore have more impacts and are even
more clearly incompatible now..
"This is exactly what is being done here: El Toro Land & Cattle agreed to abide by
conditional zoning which prohibits growth. El Toro Land & Cattle is now applying for a zone
change that will eliminate the restrictions. The entire purpose of this application is to throw the
Conditional Zone Change Agreement away which is illegal.

II. The Findings Presented by the Planning Department Are Insufficient to
Recommend Approval.

6

In order to approve the General Plan zone change, certain findings must be made by the
Board of Supervisors as required by state and local ordinances. These findings are drafted and
put forth by the Planning & Development Services Department. These findings are inadequate
and the Project cannot be approved with the facts presented herein, The first finding in the

E County's resolution states "The proposed Zone Change has been analyzed relative to its potential

Imperial Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 09-11-2020 at 08:42:30 to be detrimental to the health, safety, comfort and welfare of the persons residing or working
within the neighborhood of the proposed Zone Change. Staff concluded that the project does, not
propose land uses, densities, or development patterns that will jeopardize the health and safety of
the persons residing or working within the neighborhood of the property. Health, safety, and
welfare will not be degraded as result of this project." This statement is absolutely false: There
is no analysis-presented. In fact, the original, Conditional Zone Change made an opposite
finding, that the only way it could be compatible was with No Additional Growth provision.
There is no legal basis to analyze this project diffcrently. The immediate surrounding land use
has remained the same: The land use in Heber has become more dense and more populated since
2007. Further, the sphere of influence, general plan and other County documents do not support
this conclusion. This finding cannot be made.
The second finding states "The Zone Change is consistent with the General Plan's
underlying land use designation of the SPA Heber. The Zone Change will allow for the
expansion of an existing feed-lot operation." This is an inadequate finding. In fact, the current
zone states "No Additional Growth.' If the underlying zoning has a provision that does not allow
this, with findings supporting the prohibition of growth, this finding cannot be made.
The findings provided to the public is half of a page. The facts do not in any way support
the analysis. Under California law, the Courts may overturn findings that do not support the
record as a whole. Findings require facts, analysis and conclusions. The California Supreme
Court made clear that when findings are required by law, those findings must explain the
decision-making body's analysis. Topanga Association for a Scenic Community v. County of Los
Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506. In Topanga, the California Supreme Court held that an agency
must set forth findings to "bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and the ultimate
decision or order."(Id. at 515). Furthermore, the findings set forth by the agency must be

supported by substantial evidence in the record. (Id. at 514.) The findings presented are
inadequate.

II. A Mitigated Negative Declaration is Inadequate and an Environmental Impact

ã Report Should be Prepared for the Project Pursuant to the California

Imperial Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 09-11-2020 at 08:42:30 F * Environmental Quality Act.
The MND fails CEQA for the multiple reasons, including but not limited to: F: Failure to analyze cumulative impacts from related projects, such as the project
site's current 18,000-head cattle operation with composting activities approved in
2007.
b •Failure to analyze impacts from increase composting operations resulting from the
17,000-head increase.
Failure to analyze impacts from increase composting operations at the Project Site
prior to start of phase 2 when the composting yard is: to be relocated.
d, Failure to analyze impacts upon relocation of the composting yard, which will

€. have additional mobile emissions and localized impacts.
Failure to translate human health effects of odor impacts.
f. Failure to incorporate feasible mitigation measures to further reduce air quality,
odor, and GHG emission impacts.
Failure to consider the unique environmental setting of this environmental justice
community, which would demand more stringent thresholds to avoid further
exacerbation of environmental impacts suffered by the surrounding community.
h. Failure to translate human health effects from project impacts to air quality, odors,
and GHG emissions, such as-to those near the Project Site:
Failure to apply numeric thresholds to GHG emissions.

a. The MND Fails to Adequately Evaluate Greenhouse Gas Emissions. The Greenhouse
Gas Emission section is marked in the Initial Study as "Less Than Significant
Impact." The reason for this mark is that a future Emissions Mitigation Plan "would

S

appear to be less than significant when addressed through the ICAPCD permitting
is process." This is an illegal, future mitigation measure with inadequate mitigation. A
statement that a future plan will address greenhouse gas emissions is insufficient. The
air quality permit operations must be analyzed and updated at this time, not at a future
date.
This project is doubling the cattle at this location and livestock is responsible for .Nd 08-Zt:8010 0ZOT-LL-60 pemwgns fuenjjege ußnouu perdeoov unoo ouedns jeuedup approximately 10-14 percent of all greenhouse gases (methane, carbon dioxide,
nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases) released in the environment. This is not adequate
mitigation to address the impacts of the increased cattle.

b. The MND Fails to Adequately Evaluate Air Quality Impacts.. The entire air quality
section relies upon a future plan and reliance on laws in place in the County. This is
inadequate analysis and future mitigation measures that do not allow the public
meaningful analysis.
To address odor, there will be accelerated removal of manure from the pens.
Instead of being in the locatioi for 18 months, the doubled amount of manure will
remain for 9-12 months. This does not address the increased odor for the 9-12 months
that it will remain. The second significant mitigation measure is relocation of the
Compost Yard, There is a general reference that the Compost Yard will not be within
two miles of a populated arca, yet there is no analysis of that site. The failure to
analyze that Compost Yard is a violation of CEQA. The Compost Yard is part of the
required analysis and is a direot impact of this current project. This is an attempt.to
separate the full project in order to avoid an-EIR.:

c. The MND Fails to Adequately Evaluate the Impacts on Agriculture. The Agriculture
and Forest Resources section is marked in the Initial Study as "Less Than Signiticant
Impaot." The reason given is that the land is in agriculture and is remaining in
agriculture. This is misleading and fails to properly identify the significant difference
between a grass crop and a cattle feedlot. The County's land use designation is

different between grass crops and a cattle feedlot. Simply stating that the land will be:
in the general category of agriculture is insufficient. Fürther, there is no analysis on
the surrounding uses which will be removing the ability to utilize the land for organic
crops or fruit and vegetable crops. It has been proven that the recent E.coli outbreaks
that have sickened thousands and in some cases caused deaths, were caused by
animals: All major buyers such as McDonalds, Yum Brands and many other buyers. 2 of leafy greens who supply grocery, foodservice and schools, all require minimum 0E:Zt.80 18 OZOZ-1L-60 pemjigns Aienlega uBnoiui paideo y unoo jouedns (usdur 1-mile buffer radius of any cattle feedlot operation. Some retail and food service
......: R .
retailers have created internal protocols that call for a 2-mile buffer as an added
precaution. Expanding a feedlot, given these limitations on fruit and vegetable
production, DOES significantly impact neighboring agriculture by limiting not only
the erops that can be grown, but the value of land for local owners as à result.

d. The MND. Fails to Adequately Evaluate the Impacts from Additional Cattle and
On-going Operation. While the Initial Study points to the increased noise and
increased on-going operation (sèe XiiI(b)), the ongoing operation is not properly
analyzed. There is no meaningful analysis of the increased traffic, no description of .....

i: the impacts to the roads, tio description of the daily trips and increased need for
employees or services. Failure to identify these matters and analyze is an additional
.:...
reäson an EIR is necessary.

IV.* The Impact on Surrounding Farmland is Devastating and Prohibits Approval.
As presented in 2007, the County and El Toro Land & Cattle are aware that increased cattle
at this location devastates the surrounding farmland. The farmland cannot be used for any
organic or conventional leafy green crop production and in the future, likely will not allow any
type of organio or conventional fruit or vegetable crops. Hundreds of surrounding acres are
losing thousands of dollars in value and rents are fifty percent less if you cannot farm fresh fruits
and vegetables. In addition to the failure to analyze this impact under CEQA, this fact must be
analyzed under the compatibility findings and must be addressed in order to grant this approval.

10

Further, for the last thirteen (13) years, the surrounding farmers were assured there would be "No
Additional Growth." Had the farmers known this property was going to be changed in such a
significant way, there might have been an opportunity to change the use of their lands over time.

Imperial Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 09-11-2020 at 08:42:30 Pl § The County boasts that it is supportive of agriculture and the right to farm. The County sets forth
a process where the Agricultural Commissioner takes a role in resolving dispütes related to:
disputes in the agricultural community. In addition to the failure to analyze this matter, it is being
done in direct contradiction to the documentation approved by the County. In this matter, the
Agricultural Commissioner member on the Environmental Evaluation Committee ("EEC") votes
that there would not be significant impacts on agriculture. The statements presented to the EEC
are inaccurate. The wrong zoning is cited in the Initial Study. There is no citation to the "No
Additional Growth" and no citation to the Conditional Zone Change" in the agricultural section
under section II. Although the "No Additional Growth" is cited in Project Summary B, the
information is misleading and inaccurate.

Imperial Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 09-11-2020 at 08:42:30 PM Impact of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) on Leafy Green Production
The combination of crop and animal agriculture can have injurious consequences.
Contamination of produce with human pathogens like E. coli 0157:H7 has been documented to
be associated with proximity to: fecal matter and livestock and presented as a contributing .:;:

factor for foodborne illness outbreaks by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Cattle
are a significant reservoir of Shiga toxin-producing E. coli that have been linked to numéroùs
multistate foodborne illness outbreaks in leafy greens since 2006.
The leafy green industry in California and Arizona have implemented programs that established
food safety metrics for the production of leafy greens to minimize the risk of contamination and
thereby foodborne iliness outbreaks. Industry and scientific experts have always noted the lack of science to define "safe" distances from CAFOs and utilized limited studles to establish minimum requirements. In 2018, the LGMA increased their buffer requirement from a
minimum of 400 feet to 1200 feet from CAFOs with over 1000 head of cattle and a minimum.of
1 mile from CAFOs with over 80,000 head of cattle. This action was taken based on a scientific study published by Berry et al., 2015 and in response to growing concerns regarding the safety
of leafy greens grown in close proximity to CAFOs given the known risk of pathogens like STEC
that cause human illness.
.. :* The retail and food service sectors of the food Industry have long been concerned with the
safety of leafy greens and other fresh produce and established their own company specific good agricultural practices (GAPs) requirements that include buffer requirements for proximity to CAFOs. Fresh cut processors have also created their own requirements: Most entities require
a minimum of 1 mile from CAFOs and composting operations with the option to increase the required distance based on any additional risk factors like topography,
: More recently, in response to the recurring foodborne illness outbreaks associated with leafy
greens, multiple coalitions and industry-government-academia partnerships have been formed
to address the concerns more aggressively regarding contamination of leafy greens growing
environments. The Leafy Greens- Safety Coalition was formed by Wegmans, Walmart, Kroger,
Costco, and Yum Brands has identified CAFO distances as a key risk under consideration. Many
of the members do not have faith in the LGMA minimum requirements given the numerous
factors that must be considered beyond just distance (e.g. climate, weather events, etc.). As,a
result, most of the members of the coalition require a minimum of 1 mile; however, several are

production near CAFOs altogether, starting to consider increasing the minimum buffer to 2 miles or prohibiting leafy greens

strategies with regard to managing risk from nearby CAFOs and will suffer further disruption if CAFOS are expanded in and around their production given the increasing expectations of the buying community and regulatory agencies. Growers will have to leave more land fallow as increased buffer requirements are put into place.

Subject: Statement

Katie,

In 2007, I heard and voted on the El Toro compost yard project in my role as an Imperial County Supervisor. I voted in favor of the project because the footprint of the current yard was there for decades and was there before the houses were built and El Toro had been operating in that area for years. But, I did vote in 2007 with the condition to not expand that current footprint because adding more cattle would have impacted those homes. I feel that if you move to a location and know what businesses exists when you buy your home, that business should be allowed to continue to exist. But, an expansion would not be contemplated by the new homeowners and an expansion should not be allowed.
