GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

4 Local Agency General Plans

5 7.

6 A local agency such as the County is required to have a general plan. (Gov. Code,

7 65300 et seq.) A general plan is "comprehensive, long-term" "plan for the physical development
of the county or city, and of any land outside its boundaries which in the planning agency's
8 I judgment bears relation to its planning.' (Gov. Code, § 65300.)

9 8. State law requires a general plan to include certain chapters, or "elements.» These
10 "mandatory" elements include those relating to land use, housing, safety, and others. (Gov. Code,
11 § 65302.) A general plan may include other "optional" elements that "relate to the physical
12 development of the county or city." (Gov. Code, § 65303.) A general plan and its elements should

13 "comprise an integrated, internally consistent and compatible statement of policies for the adopting
14 agency." (Gov. Code, § 65300.5.) Additionally, § an agency's subsequent land use actions must be

15 consistent with its general plan. (See, e.g., Gov. Code, §§ 65359 [specific plans], 66473.5
16 [subdivision maps], 65860 [zoning ordinances].)

17 9.

18 State law provides for procedures, including public notice and hearing, for adopting
or amending a general plan. (Gov. Code, § 65350 et seq.)

19 The 2040 General Plan

20 10. In

21 or about 2015, the County began preparing the 2040 General Plan, a

22 comprehensive update of its general plan. In 2015, the Board selected a consultant team to prepare

23 the 2040 General Plan in conjunction with County staff. Also in 2015, the Board directed that the
2040 General Plan "should be completed before summer of 2020.3

24 11.

25 The 2040 General Plan includes two documents: a Background Report and the plan
itself, often referred to as the Policy Document.

26 12.

27 In March 2017, the County published a draft Background Report that "provides a

28 *snapshot' in time of the County's existing conditions. It presents the physical, social, and economic
resource information required to support the preparation of the General Plan. The data and

3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- information in the Report have a baseline date of June 2016. The Background Report serves as the
2 foundation document from which subsequent planning policies and programs will be formulated.

3

4 The document is also used as the 'environmental setting' section of the General Plan EIR." The
County published revised Background Reports in October 2017 and January 2018.

13. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that on January 14,
6 2019, the County issued a Notice of Preparation of a Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR)

7

8 and Scoping Meeting for the Ventura County 2040 General Plan Update (*Notice of Preparation").

14.

9 The Notice of Preparation described the 2040 General Plan as "a comprehensive

10 update of its General Plan. The County's current General Plan was most recently updated in 2005

11 and has not been comprehensively updated since 1988. The 2040 General Plan Update is anticipated
to be adopted in 2020 and will set forth the County's vision of its future and express the goals,
12 policies, and implementation programs that will guide future decisions concerning a variety of

13

14 issues, including land use, health and safety, and resource conservation out to the year 2040."

15. The Notice of Preparation characterized the Background Report as "describe[ing]
15 existing conditions as of 2016 and potential future trends in Ventura County. It is divided into 12

16

17 chapters that cover a wide range of topics, such as demographics, economic conditions, land use,
public facilities, and environmental resources."

18 16. The Notice of Preparation characterized the second component of the 2040 General
19 Plan, the Policy Document, as "the essence of the 2040 General Plan Update. It will set forth the

20

21 goals and policies that guide future decisions within the unincorporated areas and will identify the

22 implementation programs required to carry out the goals and policies of the General Plan. The

23 Policy Document will also include land use designations and a land use diagram that specifies the

24 allowable uses of land, (e.g., residential, commercial, etc.) throughout the unincorporated area." The
Notice of Preparation also indicated, "The General Plan will address the state's mandatory elements
25 including Land Use, Circulation, Housing, Conservation, Open Space, Noise, and Safety, plus the

26

27 new requirements for Air Quality and Environmental Justice, and three new optional elements:
Water, Agriculture, and Economic Development."

28 17. The Notice of Preparation also discussed the General Plan's existing and proposed

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

land use designations. According to the Notice of Preparation, "The Proposed 2040 General Plan

2 Update Land Use Designations would refine the Existing Community and Urban land use

3 designations of the existing General Plan to more clearly distinguish among land uses allowed

4 within each designation and set forth maximum development density and intensity standards."

5 18. The Notice of Preparation also indicated that the "2040 General Plan Update will

6 also include updates to seven of the ten Area Plans that are part of the existing General Plan: 1) EI
7 Rio/Del Norte; 2) Thousand Oaks; 3) Lake Sherwood/Hidden Valley; 4) Ojai Valley; 5) Oak Park;
8 6) Piru; [and] 7) North Ventura Avenue.3

9 19. In May 2019, the County released a "preliminary public review draft" of the 2040
10 General Plan Policy Document. According to this draft, the "Ventura County 2040 General Plan

11 Policy Document is organized into 11 chapters," including one for an introduction, nine for each of

12 the 2040 General Plan's elements, and one for the County's Area Plans.

13 20. In June 2019, the County Planning Commission ("Planning Commission") held work
14 sessions to consider and revise the draft 2040 General Plan.

15 21. In August 2019, the Board held a work session to consider the draft 2040 General

16 Plan. At that work session, the Board made revisions to the draft General Plan. On September 10,

17 2019, the Board again considered, reviewed the prior revisions to, and made further revisions to the

18 2040 General Plan.

19 22. In January 2020, the County released for public review a revised draft Background

20 Report. The 1,034-page draft Background Report included chapters on Demographics and
21 Economics; Land Use; Health and Well-Being; Housing; Transportation and Mobility; Public

22 Facilities, Services, and Infrastructure; Natural Resources; Agriculture; Water Resources; Hazards

23 and Safety; and Climate Change. The January 2020 Background Report states, "The data and
24 information in the Background Report have a baseline date of June 2016." The January 2020

25 Background Report further states, "The document is also used as the 'environmental setting' section

26 of the General Plan EIR."

27 23. In January 2020, the County also released for public review a "public review draft"

28 of the 2040 General Plan Policy Document. This draft document identified the nine General Plan

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 elements as:

2

3 a. the Land Use and Community Character Element, which "establishes the pattern and

4 intensity of land use in the county and sets forth policies and standards to guide
future development";
b. the Housing Element, which "ensures that there is adequate land to appropriately
accommodate the County's fair share of population growth and housing needs." The

300 2040 General Plan's Housing Element was not revised from the existing County
general plan. The County will be subsequently update its Housing Element separate
from the 2040 General Plan;

C.

11 the Circulation, Transportation, and Mobility Element, which "focuses on providing

12 a balanced, multimodal transportation network that meets the needs of all users of

13 streets, roads, and highways for safe and convenient travel in a manner that is
suitable to the rural, suburban, or urban context";

14

15 d. the Public Facilities, Services, and Infrastructure Element, which "provides goals,

16 policies, and programs to guide essential public facilities and services, energy

17 efficiency, infrastructure funding, wastewater treatment and disposal, solid and

18 hazardous waste, flood control and drainage, public utilities, community facilities,

19 library facilities and services, parks and recreation facilities, law enforcement and
emergency services, and fire protection";

20 e.

21 the Conservation and Open Space Element, which "focuses on the long-term

22 preservation and conservation of both the county's natural and developed open space
environment";

23 f.

24 the Hazards and Safety Element, which "provides for the protection of the

25 community from any unreasonable risks associated with the effects of the following:

26 wildfire hazards, flood hazards, sea level rise and coastal flooding, geologic and

27 seismic hazards, hazardous materials, transportation related hazards, oil and gas

28 production and transportation incidents, military compatibility, noise, air quality, and
increasing temperatures";

6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

g, the Agriculture Element, which "focuses on the protection, preservation, and

2 expansion of productive agriculture";
h. the Water Resources Element, which discusses how "[a]dequate water supply is a

4 current and ongoing concern in Ventura County"; and

5 i the Economic Vitality Element, which "focuses on supporting a resilient economy a
that promotes economic health of the county, sustainable funding for public services,
a thriving business environment, and job retention and growth."

8 24. The draft of the 2040 General Plan Policy Document also included County Area

9 Plans and several appendices.
10 The 2040 General Plan Draft EIR

11 25. Also in January 2020, the County released the 2040 General Plan's Draft

12 Environmental Impact Report ("Draft EIR") for public review. Petitioners are informed and believe,

13 and on that basis allege, that the County sent a Notice of Availability of a Draft EIR for Public
14 Review ("Notice of Availability") for the 2040 General Plan to the County Clerk and Recorder for
15 posting. The Notice of Availability indicated that the public review and comment period for the
16 Draft EIR would begin on Monday, January 13, 2020 and end on Thursday, February 27, 2020.

17 26. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that the County sent a

18 Notice of Completion and Environmental Document Transmittal ("Notice of Completion") to the
19 State Clearinghouse of the Governor's Office of Planning and Research. Petitioners are informed

20 and believe, and on that basis allege, that the State Clearinghouse received the Notice of

21 Completion from the County on January 10, 2020. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that

22 basis allege, that the State Clearinghouse distributed the Draft EIR to State agencies on January 14,

23 2020. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that the State Clearinghouse

24 indicated to those State agencies that the review period for the Draft EIR ended on February 26,

25 2020.

26 27. According to the Notice of Availability, the Draft EIR "identified significant and

27 unavoidable environmental impacts in the following resource areas": Agriculture and Forestry

28 Resources; Air Quality; Biological Resources; Cultural, Tribal Cultural, and Paleontological

7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Resources; Greenhouse Gas Emissions; Hazards, Hazardous Materials, and Wildfire; Mineral and

2 Petroleum Resources; Noise and Vibration; Public Services and Recreation; Transportation and

3 Traffic; and Utilities.

4 28. The Draft EIR for the 2040 General Plan included an executive summary and a

5 project description section for the 2040 General Plan. This section identified the "geographic extent

6 of the plan area." This same section discussed the 2040 General Plan's "proposed organizational
structure, land use designations, and updated set of land use density and intensity standards." The
8 project description identifies the development standards for certain proposed land use designations.

9 The Draft EIR did not discuss the effect of such land use designations on existing properties,

10 including whether the designations would decrease property development intensities within the

11 2040 General Plan area.

12 29. The Draft EIR's project description also included a land use diagram "to guide the

13 general distribution, location, and extent of the various land use designations throughout the
14 county."

15 30. The Draft EIR's project description also provided "a brief summary of cach element

16 of the 2040 General Plan." The project description section of the Draft EIR did not identify specific

17 goals, policies, or programs of any element of the 2040 General Plan.

18 31. The Draft EIR's project description included general population, employment, and
19| household "growth forecast[s]" for the entire unincorporated portion of the County through 2040.

20 32. The Draft EIR also included a section regarding the 2040 General Plan's

21 "Environmental Impact Analysis." This section of the Draft EIR provided the "environmental
22 setting" for the 2040 General Plan by reference to the Background Report: "The existing conditions

23 against which potential impacts are evaluated are based on the environmental and regulatory setting

24 information published in the January 2020 Background Report, which is included in this draft EIR

25 as Appendix B."

26 33. The Draft EIR's Environmental Impact Analysis section included a discussion of the
27 2040 General Plan's potentially significant environmental impacts relating to the following topics:

28 Aesthetics, Scenic Resources, and Light Pollution; Agricultural and Forestry Resources; Air

8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Quality; Biological Resources; Cultural, Tribal Cultural, and Paleontological Resources; Energy;

2 Geologic Hazards; Greenhouse Gas Emissions; Hazards, Hazardous Materials, and Wildfire;

3 Hydrology and Water Quality; Land Use and Planning; Mineral and Petroleum Resources; Noise

4 and Vibration; Population and Housing; Public Services and Recreation; Transportation and Traffic;

5 and Utilities.

6 34. The Draft EIR also contained a discussion of alternatives to the 2040 General Plan,

7 including four alternatives "selected for detailed analysis."

8 35. The Draft EIR also included appendices, including the January 2020 Background

9 Report.

10 36. On February 26, 2020, Petitioners submitted to the County through legal counsel a

11 comment letter on the Draft EIR. Petitioners commented that the Draft EIR: was not properly

12 circulated for review to State agencies; failed to adequately discuss the 2040 General Plan's
13 environmental setting; failed to adequately discuss or analyze the effect of the 2040 General Plan's

14 new land use designations; failed to provide an adequate level of detail regarding 2040 General Plan
15 build-out; provides misleading information regarding the distribution of 2040 General Plan build-

16 out; improperly limited the geographic scope of the 2040 General Plan's direct and indirect impacts;

17 inadequately analyzed the 2040 General Plan's direct and indirect impacts on mineral resources;
18 and failed to analyze the 2040 General Plan's consistency with applicable regulatory and land use
19 plans.
20 The 2040 General Plan Final EIR

21 37. On or about July 2, 2020, the County made available for public review the Final

22 Environmental Impact Report ("Final EIR") for the 2040 General Plan. The Final EIR includes the

23 numerous written comments on the Draft EIR from public agencies, private organizations, and

24 individuals. The Final EIR includes "master responses" to the Draft EIR comments. According to

25 the Final EIR, "Master responses are provided for the following topics: greenhouse gas emissions;

26 2040 General Plan land use, population projections and buildout assumptions; the 2020 Regional
27 Housing Needs Allocation and 2021-2029 Housing Element Update; 2040 General Plan oil and gas
28 policies; draft EIR Mitigation Measure AG-2 for loss of important farmland; the 2040 General Plan

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Background Report; and recirculation of the draft EIR." The Final EIR also provided responses to

2 invidual comments, including those from Petitioners. These responses frequently referred to the

3 master responses.

4 38. As a result of comments on the Draft EIR, the County revised the Draft EIR, as
indicated in section of the Final EIR. The County also provided new information. The Final BIR
6 attaches a new report entitled "Revised Draft EIR Appendix D GHG Calculations." This report
contains a "discussion of revisions to the GHG emission calculations in the Draft EIR" "pursuant to

8 comments made on the draft EIR." The Final EIR noted, "In response to these comments, two major

9 changes were made to the emissions inventory and forecast estimates."

10 The 2040 General Plan and Final EIR Public Hearings

11 39. On July 16, 2020, the Planning Commission conducted a public hearing "to consider

12 and provide recommendation to the Board of Supervisors regarding" the 2040 General Plan, the

13 Final EIR, and related items. At that public hearing, the Planning Commission voted 3-1 to

14 recommend that the Board: certify the Final EIR; adopt, with revisions, CEQA-related findings, a

15 Statement of Overriding Considerations, and a Mitigation Monitoring Program; repeal the existing
16 General Plan; and approve and adopt the 2040 General Plan and 2040 General Plan Background

17 Report, with revisions.

18 40. The Planning Commission's recommended revisions included the deletion of
19 Mitigation Measures PR-1, PR-2, and PR-3, the only mitigation measures in the Draft EIR designed

20 to mitigate the 2040 General Plan's significant impacts on mineral resources.

21 41. On August 4, 2020, Petitioner's counsel emailed County staff a letter regarding the

22 inadequate circulation of the Draft EIR to State agencies.

23 42. On September 1, 2020, Petitioner's counsel emailed County staff a letter regarding

24 the 2040 General Plan and its Final EIR. That letter stated in part:

25 a. that the Draft EIR was not properly circulated to State agencies under Public

26 Resources Code section 21091 and that the Final EIR's response to Petitioners'

27 previous comment on the issue was inadequate;

28 b. that the Final EIR continued to fail to provide adequate information regarding

10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 forecasted development build-out under the 2040 General Plan and that the Final

2 EIR's response to Petitioners' previous comment on the issue was inadequate. The

UJ letter include examples from other counties in Southern California that provided
V adequate general plan build-out information in EIRs;

cn C. that the Draft EIR required recirculation under CEQA Guidelines section 15088.5

6 because it was "so fundamentally and basically inadequate and conclusory in nature
that meaningful public review and comment were precluded";
8 d. that the absence of adequate 2040 General Plan build-out information precluded
O C adequate analysis in the Draft EIR of the 2040 General Plan's environmental
10 impacts, including those related to utilities such wastewater capacity and water
11 supply;

12 e that the Final EIR did not adequately clarify whether the 2040 General Plan's
13 proposed land use designations would reduce the maximum density/intensity,
14 minimum lot size, and maximum lot coverage requirements for any properties within
15 the 2040 General Plan area;

16 f. that the Final EIR inadequately considered whether the 2040 General Plan would

17 constrain future housing opportunities within the 2040 General Plan area, a

18 particularly problematic issue given that the County separated the update to its
19 Housing Element from the 2040 General Plan;

20 g. that the Final EIR inadequately analyzed the 2040 General Plan's impacts on mineral
21 resources, which are themselves part of the "environment" under CEQA. (Pub.
22 Resources Code, § 21060.5.) The letter further noted that the Draft EIR required
23 recirculation after the County improperly and without substantial evidence deleted,
24 purportedly for being infeasible, the only proposed mitigation measures (Mitigation
25 Measures PR-1, PR-2, and PR-3) that addressed the 2040 General Plan's significant
26 impacts on mineral resources; and

27 h. that the Final EIR continued to fail to properly analyze, mitigate for, of avoid the
28 2040 General Plan's foreseeable indirect impacts arising from the 2040 General

11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Plan's limitations on oil and gas production. The letter attached an August 28, 2020,

2 report from Sespe Consulting, Inc. that confirmed that the 2040 General Plan would

UJ have a significant adverse impact regarding greenhouse gas emissions arising from
V the 2040 General Plan's limitations on oil and gas production.

5 43. On September 1, 2020, the Board conducted a public hearing to "Consider

6 Certification of the 2040 General Plan Final Environmental Impact Report, Including Adoption of

7 Related Findings and Documents Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act, Repeal of

8 Existing General Plan Except for the 2014-2021 Housing Element, and Approval and Adoption of

9 the 2040 General Plan and 2040 General Plan Background Report (Planning Division Case Number
10 PL17-0141)."

11 44. On September 1, 2020, the Board voted 3-2 to approve a motion (the "Board
12 Motion") to:

13 a. "Close the public testimony, tentatively approve the recommended actions on the

14 2040 General Plan, FEIR and related documents, and direct staff to revise these

15 documents as stated below in this motion."

16 b. "Continue Public Hearing to September 15th at 3:00 p.m. for sole purpose of
17 considering final documents."

18 C. "Staff to provide the final form of the 2040 General Plan, EIR and related documents
19 at continued September 15th Public Hearing."

20 d. "In addition, direct staff to return on September 15th with all information needed for

21 Board to consider approval of the creation of a Spanish language translation of the

22 policy portion (Chapters 1 through 10, 12, and Appendix B) of the 2040 General

23 Plan.3

24 45. The Board Motion directed County staff to make the following revisions to the 2040

25 General Plan, the Final EIR, or related documents:

26 a. Update 2040 General Plan Land Use Maps to depict the Naval Base Ventura County

27 boundaries.

28 b. Insert a "Program COS-CC: Climate Emergency Council" into the "appropriate"

12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 CEQA documents. This program provides in part, "The County shall establish a
2 Climate Emergency Council (CEC) a by a resolution of the Board of Supervisors to
w advise the Board of Supervisors on climate action planning and implementation of
the Climate Action Plan (CAP) goals, policies, and programs." The Board Motion
details further aspects of this program regarding the establishment of the Climate
Emergency Council as well as the Council's duties and composition. The Board

7 Motion noted that information regarding the Climate Emergency Council was

8 "inadvertently not included" in the 2040 General Plan's Final EIR, Mitigation
a Monitoring Program, or Final CEQA Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding
10 Considerations.

11 C. Revise the 2040 General Plan to include a new policy, Policy PFS-10.8, regarding
12 "Discretionary Development Near Trails."

13 d. Revise the 2040 General Plan to add a new program, Program PFS-X, regarding
14 "Development and Inclusion of Los Padres National Forest and Santa Monica

15 Mountains National Recreation Area Trails and Map."

16 e. Revise the 2040 General Plan to add a new policy, Policy EV-X, regarding "Future
17 Job Opportunities."

18 f. Revise the 2040 General Plan's Ojai Valley Area Plan to add a new policy, Policy
19 OV-22.1, regarding "Level of Service (LOS) Standards" for road segments and

20 intersections.

21 g. Revise the 2040 General Plan to add a new program, Program COS-M, regarding
22 "Oil and Gas Tax."

23 h. Revise the Final EIR to revise a mitigation measure and General Plan program,
24 Mitigation Measure PS-1 (2040 General Plan Program PFS-X), regarding "Review

25 Future Projects for Incorporation of Law Enforcement Security Measures."

26 i. Update and revise the 2040 General Plan and its maps for the County's area plans.

27 j. Revise the 2040 General Plan and its Ojai Valley Area Plan's Policy OJ-22.5:

28 Highway 33.

13

1 k. Revise the 2040 General Plan to add a new policy, Policy X, regarding "Consultation

2 with California State University Channel Islands."

3 1. Revise the 2040 General Plan to add a new program, Program COS X, regarding

4 "Oil and Gas Setbacks."

46. The Board did not direct the Planning Commission to review the revisions directed

6 by the Board Motion. The Planning Commission did not subsequently review or consider the Board

7 Motion or the revisions contained therein.

8 47. On September 15, 2020, Petitioners' legal counsel emailed County staff a letter

9 regarding the 2040 General Plan and its Final EIR.

10 48. On September 15, 2020, the Board conducted a "Continued Public Hearing for the

11 Sole Purpose of Considering Certification of the 2040 General Plan Final Environmental Impact

12 Report, Including Adoption of Related Findings and Documents Pursuant to the California
13 Environmental Quality Act, Repeal of Existing General Plan Except for the 2014-2021 Housing

18 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

19

20 (Violations of CEQA; Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)

59.

21 Paragraphs 1 through 58 are incorporated here as if fully set forth herein.

60.

22 CEQA is set forth in the Public Resources Code, section 21000 et seq. Additionally,

23 the Governor's Office of Planning and Research and the California Natural Resources Agency

24 together prepare, develop, certify, and adopt the "CEQA Guidelines" (14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15000

25 et seq.) and amendments thereto. The CEQA Guidelines are regulations that clarify, interpret, and
implement CEQA.

26 61.

27 Broadly speaking, CEQA directs certain local agencies such as the County to

28 identify and analyze the potentially significant environmental impacts of certain actions, or
"projects," so as to inform agency decision-makers and the public of the environmental

1ARr 15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- consequences of a project. An agency undertaking the initial CEQA review of a project, referred to

2 as the "lead" agency, will usually engage in a three-step process. First, the lead agency determines if

3 the action being considered is a "project" subject to CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15060.) Second,

4 the lead agency determines if the project is exempt from CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15061.)

5 Third, the lead agency determines whether the project could result in potentially significant

6 environmental impacts. Depending on whether or not there are significant impacts and whether
those impacts can be mitigated to a level below significance, a lead agency will prepare a negative

8 declaration, a mitigated negative declaration, or a full EIR for a project. (CEQA Guidelines,

9 con 15063, subd. (b).)

10 62. CEQA directs public agencies to prepare an EIR "as early as feasible in the planning

11 process to enable environmental considerations to influence project program and design and yet late

12 enough to provide meaningful information for environmental assessment." (CEQA Guidelines,

13 § 15004, subd. (b).) Particularly for public projects sponsored by the lead agency itself, CEQA
14 notes that "public agencies shall not undertake actions concerning the proposed public project that

15 would have a significant adverse effect or limit the choice of alternatives or mitigation measures,

16 before completion of CEQA compliance." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15004, subd. (b)(2).)

17 63. CEQA imposes substantive and procedural requirements on agencies such as the

18 County regarding the preparation, contents, adequacy, public review, and certification of an EIR.

19 64. A lead agency preparing an EIR will start with a draft EIR. (CEQA Guidelines,

20 s0p 15084.) A draft EIR must include, among other items:
5888 0 a. a brief summary of the project, its consequences, and its significant impacts (CEQA
Guidelines, § 15123);
b. a project description that includes sufficient information for evaluation and review of
the environmental impacts of the project, including the location of the project, a
statement of the project objectives, a description of the project's characteristics, a
26 statement briefly describing the intended uses of the EIR, a list of agencies that are
27 expected to use the EIR, and a list of environmental review and consultation

28 requirements (CEQA Guidelines, § 15124);

16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

C. a description of the project's "environmental setting," a "description of the physical

2 environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project," typically at the time they
3 exist at the time of the issuance of the project's notice of preparation. The
4 environmental setting "will normally constitute the baseline physical conditions by

5 which a lead agency determines whether an impact is significant. The description of

6 the environmental setting shall be no longer than is necessary to provide an

7 understanding of the significant effects of the proposed project and its alternatives."

8 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15125);

9 d. a discussion of the significant environmental impacts of the project, including those

10 that cannot be avoided and those that are irreversible (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15126,

11 15126.2);

12 e, the mitigation measures proposed to minimize the project's significant impacts

13 (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15126, 15126.4); and

14 f. a reasonable range of project alternatives that meet the project's objectives while

15 avoiding or reducing its significant environmental impacts (CEQA Guidelines,

16 §§ 15126, 15126.6).

17 65. Once a lead agency has completed the draft EIR, it must file a "notice of
18 completion" of the draft EIR with the Office of Planning and Research. (CEQA Guidelines,

19 15085.) The lead agency must consult with and request comments on the draft EIR from various
20 public agencies. (CEQA Guidelines, § 156086.) A lead agency must also prepare a "notice of the

21 availability" of the draft EIR to provide the public with notice of the draft EIR as well as the

22 opportunity to provide comments on it. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15087.) The public review period for

23 a project submitted for review by State agencies, such as the 2040 General Plan, shall be no less

24 than 45 days. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15105, subd. (a).)

25 66. After a public review and comment on a draft EIR, an agency must prepare a final a EIR
26 before approving a project. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15089.) Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section

27 15132, a final EIR must include:

28 a. the draft EIR or the revised draft EIR;

17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 b. the comments received on the draft EIR;

2 C. a list of persons, organizations, and public agencies commenting on the draft EIR;

3 d. the responses to comments prepared by the lead agency; and
e. any information added by the lead agency.

5 67. CEQA requires a lead agency to adequately respond to comments from other
6 agencies and the public on a draft EIR. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21092.5; CEQA Guidelines,

7 § 15088.)

8 68. Also before approving a project, a lead agency must certify the final EIR. (CEQA

9 Guidelines, § 15090.) If a project will result in one or more significant environmental impacts, a

10 lead agency must also make certain findings supported by substantial evidence. (CEQA Guidelines,

11 § 15091.) If a project will result in one or more significant environmental impacts that will not be
12 mitigated or avoided, a lead agency may only approve the project if it determines that the project's
13 benefits "outweigh the unavoidable adverse environmental effects" of the project. Such a "statement

14 of overriding considerations shall be supported by substantial evidence in the record." (CEQA

15 Guidelines, § 15093.)

16 69. Respondents have violated CEQA by failing to proceed in a manner required by law

17 and by failing to support their determinations or decisions with substantial evidence. (Pub.
18 Resources Code, § 21168.5.) Alternatively, Respondents have violated CEQA by proceeding in
19 excess of their jurisdiction and by prejudicially abusing their discretion by failing to proceed in the

20 manner required by law, by failing to support their decisions with findings, and by failing to support

21 their findings with substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168; Code Civ. Proc.,

22 § 1094.5.)

23 70. Respondents failed to proceed in a manner required by law and violated CEQA by
24 failing to properly circulate the Draft EIR, including in accordance with Public Resources Code

25 section 21091 and CEQA Guidelines section 15087.

26 71. Respondents failed to proceed in a manner a required by law and violated CEQA by

27 certifying the Final EIR, which is inadequate and fails to comply with the requirements of CEQA

28 and the CEQA Guidelines. Respondents violated CEQA by, among other items:

18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 a. undertaking "actions concerning the proposed public project that would have a

2 significant adverse effect or limit the choice of alternatives or mitigation measures,

3 before completion of CEQA compliance" in contravention of CEQA Guidelines
; section 15004;

5 b. failing to provide in the Final EIR an accurate, complete, and stable description of
the 2040 General Plan, which resulted in a failure of the Final EIR to adequately

7 analyze the 2040 General Plan's environmental impacts;

8 C. failing to adequately describe in the Final EIR the environmental setting of the 2040
O General Plan;
10 d failing to adequately analyze in the Final EIR the 2040 General Plan's impacts
11 regarding agricultural and forestry resources, air quality, biological resources,
12 energy, greenhouse gas emissions, hydrology and water quality, land use and
13 planning, mineral and petroleum resources, population and housing, transportation
14 and traffic, and utilities;

15 e. failing to identify, consider, and adopt mitigation measures or project alternatives to

16 mitigate, lessen, or avoid the 2040 General Plan's significant environmental impacts,

17 including mitigation measures and project alternatives suggested by Petitioners and

18 others;

19 f. failing to adequately support the rejection of feasible mitigation measures or project

20 alternatives;

21 g. failing to adequately respond to comments on the Draft EIR;

22 h. failing to recirculate the Draft EIR, including as required by CEQA Guidelines

23 section 15088.5; and

24 i. failing to support with substantial evidence the project-related CEQA findings and

25 the 2040 General Plan's Statement of Overriding Considerations, including the

26 conclusory statements therein regarding both the infeasibility of certain mitigation

27 measures regarding impacts to mineral resources as well as the purported benefits of

28 the 2040 General Plan.

19
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 72.

2 As a result of the foregoing CEQA violations, including the deficiencies in and

U associated with the Final EIR, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by certifying the

4 Final EIR which does not comply with CEQA, by failing to proceed in the manner required by law,
and by failing to act on the basis of substantial evidence.

5 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

6

7 (Violation of Planning and Zoning Law; Gov. Code, § 65000 et seq.)
73.

8 74. Paragraphs through 72 are incorporated here as if fully set forth herein.

9 California's Planning and Zoning Law (Gov. Code, § 65000 et seq.) includes
provisions regarding the authority for and scope of general plans (§ 65300 et seq.) as well as
10 provisions regarding the preparation, adoption, and amendment of general plans (§ 65350 et seq.).

11 75.

12 Government Code section 65353, subdivision (a) provides in part, "When the city or

13 county has a planning commission authorized by local ordinance or resolution to review and

14 recommend action on a proposed general plan or proposed amendments to the general plan, the

15 commission shall hold at least one public hearing before approving a recommendation on the
adoption or amendment of a general plan."

16 76.

17 Government Code section 65354 provides, "The planning commission shall make a

18 written recommendation on the adoption or amendment of a general plan. A recommendation for
approval shall be made by the affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the total membership of
19 the commission. The planning commission shall send its recommendation to the legislative body."

20 77.

21 Government Code section 65355 provides in part, "Prior to adopting or amending a
general plan, the legislative body shall hold at least one public hearing."

22 78.

23 Government Code section 65356, subdivision (a) provides in part, "The legislative

24 body may approve, modify, or disapprove the recommendation of the planning commission, if any.

25 However, any substantial modification proposed by the legislative body not previously considered
by the commission during its hearings, shall first be referred to the planning commission for its

26 Il recommendation."

27 79. The Board substantially modified the 2040 General Plan after the Planning
28 Il Commission's July 16, 2020, hearing regarding the 2040 General Plan. The Board did not refer

20
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 such modifications to the Planning Commission for its recommendation before approving and

2 adopting the 2040 General Plan. Respondents violated Government Code section 65356.

3 80. The adoption or amendment of a general plan "is a legislative act which shall be

4 reviewable pursuant to Section 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure." (Gov. Code, § 65301.5.)

5 Pursuant to Government Code section 65301.5 and Code of Civil Procedure section 1085,

6 Petitioners are entitled to the issuance of a writ of mandate compelling Respondents to vacate the

7 approval and adoption of the 2040 General Plan,

8 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

9 In each of the respects enumerated above, Respondents have violated their duties under the
10 law, abused their discretion, failed to proceed in a manner required by law, and made

11 determinations that are not supported by substantial evidence.

12 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for relief as follows:

13 1. for a peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to vacate and set aside the
14 Board's certification of the Final EIR and approval and adoption of the 2040 General Plan;

15 2. for a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary or permanent
16 injunctive relief or other order, including under Code of Civil Procedure section 526, enjoining

17 Respondents from taking any action in furtherance of, or to implement, the 2040 General Plan
18 during the pendency of this action;
19 3. for costs of the suit;

20 4. for reasonable attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5; and

21 5. for such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.
