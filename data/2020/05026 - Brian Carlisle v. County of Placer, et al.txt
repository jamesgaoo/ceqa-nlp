26 COUNTY OF PLACER ("County") and BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF THE COUNTY OF

28 the Defendant Auburn Trapshooting Club's ("ATC") appeal ("Appeal") from a County Zoning

1141616.04/SI RELIEF

1 Administrator's January 2, 2020 ruling revoking a variance ("Variance") granted to the ATC ("Board
2 Action"). The Variance had authorized the ATC to construct a 68-foot high noise-reducing sound
3 curtain at its property ("Shot Screen") which was necessary to protect Placer County residents living
4 "downrange" from the ATC, including Petitioner, from noise, lead-shot scatter, and other significant
5 adverse environmental impacts caused by the increased days and extended hours of shotgun use at
6 the ATC.

7 In denying the Appeal, the Board abused its discretion, and violated the California

8 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") by failing to require any environmental review of the
9 substantial and significant adverse environmental impacts the revocation and impending removal of
10 the Shot Screen will undoubtedly cause on Petitioner, other downrange residents, and the
11 community as a whole. The Board also abused its discretion by making findings not supported by
12 substantial evidence in the record, and ignoring substantial evidence in the record supporting
13 approval of the Appeal. These abuses of discretion directly prejudice Petitioner.
14 Petitioner seeks injunctive and declaratory relief to prevent Respondents from revoking the
15 Variance and/or enforcing any order to remove the Shot Screen without first complying with
16 controlling law, including without limitation CEQA and its own County Code provisions regarding
17 intensified/expanded gun range use beyond those present in 2005.

18 Concurrently, Petitioner brings this action against the ATC seeking damages as well as
19 injunctive and declaratory relief based on the ATC's creation of both a public a and private nuisance
20 stemming from excessive noise levels, lead-shot scatter, and other environmental and physical
21 impacts emanating from its property in violation of controlling law.

22 Petitioner alleges as follows:

23 INTRODUCTION

24 1. Historically, the ATC, a shooting range in Auburn, California, was open
25 approximately 2.5 days per week (Thursday 2 p.m. to 8 p.m., Saturday 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., and 3 Sunday
26 10 a.m. to 3 p.m.) ("ATC's Historic Use"). As a result, noise and other pollution due to shooting at
27 the ATC was annoying to downrange residents, but may have been lawful under controlling law. In
28 or around 2011, however, the ATC attracted new shooters and substantially extended its days and

Mallory & Natsis LLP VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; REQUEST FOR INJUNCTIVE
1141616.04/SF RELIEF

F hours of operation. By 2017, as usage continued to intensify, the noise levels at neighboring
2 properties downrange from the ATC had become intolerable, and, according to scientific research,
3 hazardous to human physical and mental health.

4 2. Placer County law provides that shooting ranges may not operate in excess of historic
5 levels without a County-issued use permit. Despite the substantial increase and intensification of
6 hours, users, and shooting volume at the ATC, far in excess of ATC's Historic Use, the ATC has
7 continued to operate without obtaining such a use permit, over the growing objections of downrange
8 residents, including Petitioner, who filed an administrative complaint with the County about the
9 intensification in May 2017.

10 3. In May 2017, as a result of the County's failure to enforce its regulations, Petitioner
11 took it upon himself to resolve the issue with then-ATC President Chris Slane. At Slane's
12 encouragement, Petitioner arrived at a potential solution to the problem in the form of the sound-
13 muffling Shot Screen. Ultimately, Petitioner and the ATC reached an agreement based on
14 Petitioner's "Good Neighbor Proposal" under which the ATC would seek approval from the County
15 to build the Shot Screen, and Petitioner would sponsor and fund eighty percent (approximately
16 $600,000 cost to Petitioner) of that Shot Screen noise attenuation measure.

17 4. In the fall of 2018, the County granted the variance application filed by the ATC, and
18 authorized the ATC to build the Shot Screen. The primary purpose of the Shot Screen was
19 downrange noise reduction, but it was also to provide additional public benefits, including, among
20 other things, reducing lead contamination from lead shot pellets and reducing downrange light
21  pollution caused by floodlights at the ATC.

22 5. By February 2019, the Shot Screen was complete. But the project had an
23 unanticipated effect: While the downrange residents saw an immediate and substantial
24| improvement - noise levels dropped by roughly 15-20 decibels uprange residents began to
25 complain of a modest increase in noise due to reflections (rebounds) of the shotgun noise off of the

26 Shot Screen.

27 6. In light of the complaints, in June 2019, Petitioner presented a potential solution to
28 the County to resolve the uprange noise issues: slant portion of the Shot Screen, thereby deflecting

LAW OFFICES -3- .Ilen Matkins Leck Gamble Mallory & Natsis VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; REQUEST FOR INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF 1141616.04/SF

the rebounded noise straight upward and not toward the uprange residents. After a delay of nearly
2 three months, the County responded negatively to Petitioner's proposal, citing a vague report
3 prepared by its own noise consultant stating that while Carlisle's proposal "could reduce noise to
4 pre-Shot-Shield levels," the Shot Screen should nonetheless be entirely removed in order to ensure
5 with absolute certainty that uprange noise was restored to its pre-Shot Screen levels.

6 7. Petitioner, with the support of the ATC, submitted a detailed rebuttal, but the County,
7 despite agreeing to have its expert respond to the rebuttal during a meeting in August 2019, ignored
8 the rebuttal, as well as follow up emails from Petitioner on September 9, 2019, September 25, 2019
9 and October 8, 2019 about the County's promised response. Instead, the County scheduled a public
10 hearing on the Shot Screen for December 19, 2019, and recommended its removal. On January 2,
11 2020, consistent with that recommendation, Zoning Administrator Steve Pedretti issued a Notice of
12 Decision revoking the Variance and ordering removal of the Shot Screen within 90 days. The ATC
13 appealed the Zoning Administrator's decision to the Board, and Carlisle notified Respondents and
14 the ATC of the facts and law set forth in this pleading, as well as his intent to file suit against
15 Respondents and the ATC if the Appeal was denied. On March 9, 2020, the Board denied the ATC's
16 Appeal.

17 8. Carlisle now files this action to set aside and vacate the Board's denial of the ATC's
18 Appeal, compel the Board to issue a new decision granting the Appeal, and direct Defendant to
19 return to ATC's Historic Use. If the Board Action is allowed to stand, and the Variance is revoked,
20 the Shot Screen will be removed, and the ATC will continue its unlawful intensified use, only now
21 with no noise attenuation whatsoever, causing immediate and long-term harm to Petitioner and other
22 downrange residents, as well as to the environment.

23 9. The Board Action was improper in several respects. First, the Board failed to
24 proceed in the manner required by applicable Placer County Code provisions governing the
25 revocation of a variance and failed to make adequate findings, as required by Section 17.62.170 of
26 the Placer County Code, that the Variance "was obtained through misrepresentation" or that the Shot
27 Screen was "established or is conducted in a manner that violates or fails to comply with the
28 provisions of this code or a condition of approval." In addition, the Board Action was not supported

LAW OFFICES
llen Matkins Leck Gamble -4-
Mallory & Natsis LLP VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; REQUEST FOR INJUNCTIVE
1141616.04/SF RELIEF

by substantial evidence in the record, which instead showed that the unanticipated effects of the
2 Shot Screen on uprange residents would likely be eliminated under Petitioner's proposal, and that
3  the Variance was therefore not in violation of any County Code provision or condition of approval.

4 10. Second, the Board Action was unlawful for the separate reason that it improperly
5 exempted the Variance revocation from mandatory environmental review under CEQA. The
6 County adopted the Categorical Exemption based on CEQA Guidelines section 15061(b)(4).
7 However, pursuant to Section 15061(b)(4), a project is only categorically exempt from CEQA if it
8 will be "rejected or disapproved." Here, however, the Shot Screen was approved and has already
9 been constructed. Thus, revoking the Variance cannot reasonably be construed as the rejection of a
10 project. To the contrary, the removal of the 68-foot Shot Screen is a discretionary "project" under
11 CEQA and is therefore subject to mandatory environmental review. The Board subsequently
12 adopted several supplemental Categorical Exemptions to bolster the County's effort to exempt the
13 Variance revocation from CEQA, but none of those exemptions apply either. Among other things,
14 use at the ATC has intensified since the Shot Screen's construction. Consequently, if the Shot Screen
15 is removed, significant adverse environmental impacts beyond those which pre-dated its
16 construction, including increased noise and lead pollution, will occur. A project cannot be
17 categorically exempt from CEQA when substantial evidence in the record reveals the presence of
18 an actual, adverse, significant environmental impact. That is the case here. The evidence submitted
19 by Petitioners shows that removal of the Shot Screen would cause immediate and significant adverse
20 environmental impacts on downrange property owners. Thus, to the extent the Board relied on any
21 additional Categorical Exemptions, it did so improperly. In short, the Board abused its discretion
22 by failing to require any environmental review under CEQA of the Variance revocation and order
23 to remove the Shot Screen.

24 11. In light of the Board's erroneous denial of the Appeal without any concomitant Board
25 mandate that the ATC return to its Historic Use, Petitioner hereby seeks: writ of mandate directing
26 the Board to set aside its denial of the Appeal and maintain the pre-denial status quo, until such time
27 as the Board either orders the ATC to return to its Historic Use, or alternatively, refrains from
28 enforcing the revocation of the Variance (and removal of the Shot Screen) to any extent until full

1141616.04/SF RELIEF

1 compliance with CEQA is obtained, with resulting sound attenuation solutions (including
2 maintaining the Shot Screen, modifying the Shot Screen, removing the Shot Screen and imposing
3 new sound attenuation measures, etc.). Petitioner further seeks a stay, a temporary restraining order

4 and/or preliminary injunction prohibiting any enforcement of the Variance revocation by
5 Respondents pending final judgment in this action.

6 12. In addition to the Board's unlawful denial of the Appeal, Petitioner brings claims
7 against the ATC for public and private nuisance, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief, based

8 on the excessive noise, light, and other pollution caused by intensified use at the ATC. Placer
9 County Zoning Ordinance 5459-B prohibits commercial shooting ranges from operating at levels in
10 excess of those which existed prior to January 1, 2006 (again, "Historic Use") without obtaining
11 use permit. The ATC's Historic Use has increased substantially since 2006 - but the ATC has not -
12 obtained a use permit allowing that increase. Accordingly, Petitioner seeks damages from the ATC,
13 as well as declaratory and injunctive relief limiting the ATC to its Historic Use.
14 THE PARTIES

15 13. PETITIONER BRIAN CARLISLE is an individual who owns real property and
16 resides at 5665 Oak Knoll Lane in Auburn, which is "downrange" from the ATC. Carlisle is directly
17 and beneficially interested in the Board's denial of the Appeal and resulting order to remove the
18 Shot Screen. In addition, Carlisle sponsored and paid for eighty percent of the Shot Screen
19 constructed on the ATC's property, and is directly and beneficially interested for that reason as well.
20 Further, Carlisle opposes Respondent County's revocation of the Variance on behalf of himself and
21 members of the public whose property interests will be significantly adversely affected by the
22 revocation of the Variance and removal of the Shot Screen, and the Board's failure to discharge its
23 legal duties prior to affirming the revocation.

24 14. RESPONDENT COUNTY OF PLACER is a political subdivision of the State of
25 California, the lead agency charged with administering the provisions of CEQA, and controlling
26 State and County law as they pertain to matters within its jurisdiction.

27 15. RESPONDENT BOARD OF SUPERVISORS is, and was at all times relevant to this
28 action, the governing body that has final decision-making authority for Respondent County.

3 17. Petitioner does not know the true names and capacities of Respondents and/or Real
4 Parties In Interest fictitiously named herein as DOES through 50, inclusive, whether individual,
5 corporate, governmental, or otherwise, and therefore sue these Respondents by these fictitious
6 names. Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege, that such fictitiously named
7 Respondents and/or Real Parties In Interest are responsible in some manner for the acts or omissions
8 complained of or pending herein. Petitioners will amend this petition to allege the fictitiously named
9 Respondents' and/or Real Parties In Interests' true names and capacities when ascertained by
10 Petitioners.

11 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

18. Petitioners bring this action as a Petition for Writ of Mandate pursuant to 12

13 Sections 1085 and/or 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, and Sections 21167, 21168 and/or
14 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

15 19. Venue is proper in this Court because Respondents and the subject properties are
16 located in Placer County, and because the Board Action place in Placer County.
17 TIMELY FILING OF CEOA CLAIM

18 20. The Notice of Exemption from CEQA was filed with the County Clerk, at the
19 earliest, on March 9, 2020.

20 21. On April 6, 2020, the Judicial Council adopted Emergency Rule 9, which provides:
21 "Notwithstanding any other law, the statutes of limitations for civil causes of action are tolled from
22 April 6, 2020, until 90 days after the Governor declares that the state of emergency related to the
23 COVID-19 pandemic is lifted."

24 22. On April 15, 2020, Petitioner's attorney provided Respondents with notice of
25 Petitioner's intent to file this lawsuit, including the challenge under CEQA.

26 EXHAUSTION OF A STRATIVE REMEDIES/STANDING

27 23. Petitioner has exhausted his administrative remedies because the Board Action was
28 a final decision and reconsideration is not available.

LAW OFFICES -7- llon Matkins Leck Gamble Mallory & Natsis LLP VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; REQUEST FOR INJUNCTIVE
1141616.04/SF RELIEF

24. Petitioner raised factual and legal arguments to Respondents, both verbally and in
2 writing, prior to the Board Action on March 9,

3 25. The claims raised in this Petition were presented by Petitioner and/or other members
4 of the public prior to the Board Action, including by March 5, 2020 correspondence.

5 26. Petitioner has a direct and beneficial interest in the Board's full and complete
6 compliance with the legal requirements for revocation of the Variance and resulting removal of the
7 Shot Screen, CEQA, and any and all other applicable laws implicated by its denial of the Appeal.

8 27. Petitioner is also a member of the public who has the right to enforce the County's
9 duties under CEQA and any and all other applicable laws imposed on implicated by their
10 consideration and denial of the Appeal.

11 28. Petitioner is an owner of certain real property in Placer County whose property rights
12 have been harmed, are currently being harmed, and will be further harmed should the requested
13 relief be denied.

14 29. Petitioner has no other plain, speedy, and adequate remedy, in the ordinary course,
15 to set aside or reverse the Board's abuse of discretion, or violation of the mandatory standard of
16 substantial evidence, in denying the Appeal and revoking the Variance, and will suffer irreparable
17 injury unless this Court issues the writ and injunctive relief requested in this Petition. Moreover,
18  unless the Court issues the writ and injunctive relief requested herein, Petitioner is informed and
19 believes, and thereon alleges, that the environment will be adversely impacted by the County's
20 failure to conduct environmental review of the adverse environmental impacts which will result

21 from its revocation.

22 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL

23 30. Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil
24 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights
25 affecting the public interest.

26 31. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit on the
27  general public by ensuring compliance with CEQA, Placer County rules requiring Minor Use
28 Permits for intensification of use at a commercial shooting range, and/or other laws which are

LAW OFFICES

necessary to protect the use and enjoyment of private property.

2 32. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make an award of
3 attorney's fees to Petitioner and against Respondents appropriate in this case.

4 LEGAL BACKGROUND

5 Revocation of Variance

6 33. Placer County Code section 17.62.170 governs the procedural and legal requirements
7 to revoke a land use permit such as a variance. "The code official may initiate proceedings as
8 provided by this section to revoke the approval of any land use permit ... in any case where it is
9 determined that the permit was obtained through misrepresentation, or where a use of land has been
10 established or is conducted in a manner that violates or fails to comply with the provisions of this
11 code or a condition of approval, or where the use of land is undertaken in violation of any local,
12 state or federal law which affects the health, safety, peace, morals or general welfare of the public."
13 On appeal, the Board "may affirm, modify, or reverse the decision to revoke the permit."

14 34. On appeal, section 17.61.110(D)(4)(a)(i) provides that the Board "may affirm, affirm
15| in part, or reverse the action, decision or determination that is the subject of the appeal, based upon
16 findings of fact about the particular case. The findings shall identify the reasons for the action on
17 the appeal, and verify the compliance or noncompliance of the subject of the appeal with the
18 provisions of this chapter."

19 35. Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5(b), the Board Action is reviewed for
20 prejudicial abuse of discretion, which "is established if the respondent has not proceeded in the

21 manner required by law, the order or decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are
22 not supported by the evidence."

23 36. In reviewing the Board Action, the court reviews the entire record and the fact-
24 finding process to determine whether the decision should be set aside as an abuse of discretion
25 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. Here, the Board abused its discretion because
26 it did not make the required findings, the decision was not supported by its findings, and the findings
27 are not supported by the evidence.

1 CEQA

2 37. In general, CEQA requires that a public agency prepare and certify an Environmental
3 Impact Report ("EIR") whenever it proposes to approve or implement a project that may have a
4 significant effect on the environment. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000 et seq.; 14 Cal. Admin. Code
5 §§ 15000 et seq. ("CEQA Guidelines").

6 38. CEQA provides exemptions from and limits on environmental review under certain
7 circumstances, including whether a project is rejected or disapproved. However, all discretionary
8 projects must comply with CEQA before action on the project can occur.

9 39. The revocation of a variance - which in this case will result in the removal of 68-
10 foot Shot Screen - is a discretionary action subject to CEQA. Revoking the Shot Screen Variance
11 at this stage is not analogous to rejecting or disapproving the variance application in the first
12 instance. To the contrary, the project here was approved and constructed, and revoking the Variance
13 will now lead to its demolition, along with any attendant environmental impacts, including those
14 caused by the loss of its sound attenuation and lead-shot gathering qualities.
15 40. Further, section 15300.2 of the CEQA Guidelines provides that no Categorical
16 Exemption may be relied upon when the substantial evidence in the record reveals the presence of
17 an actual, adverse, significant environmental impact, as is the case here.

18 41. Accordingly, compliance with CEQA requires environmental review of the Variance
19 revocation, which the County failed to undertake.
20| Minor Use Permit

21 42. Placer County Code section 17.60.120, which regulates nonconforming uses of land
22 in Placer County, provides: "Commercial shooting ranges that were in use during the twelve (12)
23 months prior to January 1, 2006 may be continued, transferred or sold provided that no such use
24 shall be enlarged or increased without first obtaining approval of a minor use permit." The ATC
25 was in use prior to January 1, 2006, and to the extent uses were "enlarged or increased" since that
26 time -as they in fact were - the ATC was obligated to seek and secure a minor use permit to permit
27 that "enlarged or increased" use. Pursuant to the plain language of the Code, absent a minor use
28 permit, the ATC may not continue to operate.

Mallory & Natsis VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; REQUEST FOR INJUNCTIVE
1141616.04/SF RELIEF

43. State law, and specifically, California Civil Code section 3482.1, confirms that
2 nuisance suits may be brought against shooting ranges provided there has been a "substantial change
3 in the nature or use of the range."

4 44. Section 17.040.030 of the County Code defines "Nuisance" to mean: "(1) any
5 conditions declared by a statute of the state of California or by an ordinance of Placer County to be

6 a nuisance; (2) any public nuisance known at common law or equity; (3) any conditions dangerous
7 to human life, unsafe, or detrimental to the public health or safety; (4) any use of land, buildings, or
8 premises established, operated, or maintained contrary to or in violation of any of the provisions of
9 Chapters 5, 8, 12, 15, 16, 17 or 18 of the Placer County Code."

10 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

11 45. Founded in 1949, the ATC had limited hours of operation since at least the 1970s:
12 2:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. on Thursdays, 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. on Saturdays, and 10:00 a.m. to
13 3:00 p.m. on Sundays. Beginning in around 2011, however, the ATC's usage and hours began to
14 | increase substantially, in part due to the growth of high school shooting clubs that the ATC allowed
15 to use its facilities. By 2017, the club was open for at least four hours a day, seven days a week, a
16 between January and July, with shooting until 8:00 p.m. on weekdays. Noise levels for downrange
17 residents spanning five miles from the ATC, including Carlisle, had become intolerable. For
18 example, Placer County Code section 9.36.060 limits noise for sensitive receptors to 70 decibels
19 from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. At the Carlisle residence, however, shooting reached 94 decibels - sixteen

20 times the sound pressure permitted by the Code, in excess of the OSHA level at which hearing
21 protection is required, and loud enough to cause serious health consequences, including hearing

22 loss. On the street next to the ATC, Lorenson Road, Petitioner measured noise at 114 decibels,
23 which is 158 times the sound pressure level permitted by the Code and controlling law.
24 46. Intensified use at the ATC also caused a substantial increase in lead contamination.

25 For years, the ATC used a Texas company called "The Lead Guys" to clean lead from topsoil over
26 the ten-acre range roughly every four years. The Lead Guys' de-contamination process creates
27 tremendous quantities of fugitive dust containing an unknown amount of lead. In 2014, the Lead
28 Guys removed ninety tons of lead from the ATC, and the Placer County Air Pollution Control

F District cited them for four violations, fined them $7,750, and instructed them not to return to Placer
2 without a permit and approved dust control method. Based on the current increased shooting level,
3 it is estimated that twenty five to thirty five tons of lead are deposited each year on the drainage.

4 47. In April of 2020, Petitioner collected a water sample from the drainage pond across
5 Lorenson Road from the ATC. The lead concentration was 1.370 milligrams per liter with a water
6 hardness of 108 milligrams per liter. The EPA 2015 Multi Sector Permit Level for lead in freshwater
7 receiving waters for this hardness level is .095 milligrams per liter. So, the lead in this adjacent
a 8 pond exceeds the EPA limit by a factor of 14.4. Under the EPA Lead and Copper Rule for Drinking
9 Water, the "action level" for lead is 0.015 milligrams per liter and the target level is 0. Thus, the
10 lead in the drainage pond exceeds the drinking water action level by factor of 91.

11 48. Although Placer County had rules in place to limit noise, including from the ATC,
12 those rules were not enforced. Specifically, in 2007, Placer County amended its Code to
13 state: "Commercial shooting ranges that were in use during the twelve (12) months prior to
14 January 1, 2006 may be continued, transferred or sold provided that no such use shall be enlarged
15 or increased without first obtaining approval of a minor use permit." Although multiple complaints
16 were lodged with the County between 2008 and the present regarding expanded and disruptive uses
17 at the ATC - including complaints based on noise, light and environmental pollution, as well as
18 unpermitted construction and use of the property for residential purposes - no enforcement actions
19 were taken, and the ATC did not obtain a minor use permit.

20 49. In May 2017, Carlisle reached out to both Placer County officials and ATC President
21 Chris Slane in an effort to address the growing nuisance. The County officials invited Carlisle to
22 file a complaint with the Code Compliance Division, which he did; Carlisle never received a
23 substantive response. Slane, for his part, refused to limit youth shooting, but encouraged Carlisle

24 to research the possible installation of a "shot screen" to reduce downrange noise. Slane further
25 introduced Carlisle to an architect named Dave Tanner, who had been working on developing shot
26 screens. Carlisle and Tanner subsequently began working together on a proposal.

RELIEF 1141616.04/SF

1 - 50. In January 2018, Carlisle presented a "Good Neighbor Proposal" to the ATC under
2 which Carlisle would fund eighty percent of the construction of a shot screen. The ATC agreed to
3 Carlisle's proposal.

4 51. In May 2018, Carlisle and Slane, as well as ATC executive Jerry Haverkamp, met
5 with Placer County Planning officials Alex Fisch and Patrick Dobbs to advise them of their plans
6 and obtain their feedback. The Planning officials explained that a variance and CEQA review would
7 likely be required, and suggested that Carlisle and the ATC engage Paul Bollard, sound engineering
8 consultant, to review the design to ensure that shooting reflections would not be louder than existing
9 backscatter. Carlisle hired Bollard, who prepared a ten-page report stating that the shot screen
10 "would provide a clearly noticeable decrease in shotgun noise in the downrange direction and that
11 reflected sound would" likely "not be an issue" at the [uprange] residences due to a three degree tilt
12 in the screen.

13 52. On June 20, 2018, the ATC submitted an application to the County seeking a
14 variance to exceed the 36-foot maximum height limit for which the area was zoned and construct a
15 sixty-eight foot shot screen. The application explained that the primary objective for the shot screen
16 was to reduce downrange noise and resulting adverse health and nuisance effects, and that the shot
17 screen would also reduce lead pollution and light pollution from flood lights at the ATC, among
18 other things.

19 53. An initial environmental study concluded that the Shot Screen would not have
20 significant environmental effects. On October 3, 2018, the Development Review Committee made
21 a formal recommendation to the Zoning Administrator to grant the Variance (PLN18-00258/VAA-
22 3968). On October 18, 2018, the Zoning Administrator held a public hearing, and ultimately
23 adopted the Development Review Committee's recommendation to grant the Variance. In support
24 of his decision, the Zoning Administration found, among other things, that the Shot Screen would
25 "substantially improve compatibility with the surrounding neighborhood," that "[i]n addition to
26 reducing downrange gun noise, the shot screen will facilitate enhanced lead collection as it will
27 concentrate the lead shot at the base of the screen and will have the co-benefit of reducing the
28 visibility of nighttime lighting from offsite locations," that granting the Variance would not

RELIEF 1141616.04/SF

"adversely affect public health or safety, is not materially detrimental to the public welfare, nor
2 injurious to the nearby property or improvements" and "will have no negative impact and in fact
3 would result in positive environmental and neighborhood compatibility benefits," and that the Shot
4 Screen would "protect downrange residents from exposure to excessive noise and help preserve the
5 rural noise environment of the surrounding areas."

6 54. The Zoning Administrator also adopted several "conditions of approval." The first
7 such condition stated: "This Variance (PLN18-00258) is approved to allow construction of a noise
8| reducing shot screen (i.e. sound curtain) with a maximum height of sixty-eight (68) feet above grade,
9 a and a length of 650 feet, at the Auburn Trap Club. The shot screen shall a be a forest green color,
10 installed at a distance of 70-80 yards from the shooters and will be tilted 3 degrees away from the
11 shooting stations to reflect noise upward. The shot screen shall be located a minimum of 10 feet in
12 front of the intermittent drainage ditch running east to west across the project site. Fourteen posts
13 ranging in height from 42 feet to 68 feet will be fastened with guy wires anchored by 8 foot deep
14 concrete piers to support the shot screen."

15 55. On October 29, 2018, the County issued a building permit to the ATC to build the
16 Shot Screen. Construction commenced shortly thereafter, and was completed by February 2019.
17 The County inspected the project and approved the construction as compliant with the building
18 permit.

19 56. While residents downrange from the ATC saw an immediate improvement noise
20 levels dropped by roughly 15-20 decibels - uprange residents began to complain of increased noise
21 due to sounds reflections of shotgun fire off of the Shot Screen. Subsequent measurements
22 confirmed that backscatter noise had increased at the nearest uprange residence.
23 57. In March 2019, Carlisle informed Patrick Dobbs, a Placer County Planning official,
24 that he would research and fund a solution to the unexpected uprange noise increase. Paul Bollard,
25 the sound engineer who had previously provided a report stating that no uprange noise impacts were
26 anticipated, declined to participate. Instead, on April 12, 2019, Carlisle retained a new engineer,
27 Mike Carr of Extant Acoustical Consulting, to develop a full 3-D model of reflections and mitigation
28 approaches. In late April, Carlisle and Carr collected substantial sound data, including from at least

LAW OFFICES

1141616.04/SF RELIEF

1 six uprange residents. By late May 2019, Carr had devised several potential solutions which, in
2 addition to eliminating the reflections, would further reduce lead contamination.

58. On June 12, 2019, Carlisle and Chris Slane from the ATC presented to several Placer

4 County Supervisors Carr's plan to reduce reflections to less than historical backscatter by modifying
the Shot Screen with "shot funnels." Supervisor George Rosasco stated that he wanted to engage

6 another sound consultant to review Carr's proposal. Carlisle noted that time was of the essence if
the proposed modifications were going to be made before the rainy season, which would delay
8 I construction.

9 59. Much to Carlisle's surprise, the County did not respond to the proposal for eleven
10 full weeks. Then, on August 16, 2019, the County provided the ATC with a three-page letter from a
11 Luke Saxelby. The letter acknowledged that the modifications "could reduce noise to pre-Shot-
12 Shield levels at these receptors," but noted that several vague issues might affect performance of the
13 modification. Saxelby provided no analysis or calculations of these issues. Nonetheless, he
14 concluded that it "is unlikely that the fix would have satisfactory results at all locations which are
15 experiencing sound reflections" and therefore concluded that "[r]emoval of the barrier is the only
16 practical solution to eliminate the reflected noise issues caused by the barrier." Later, on October 28,
17 2019, Saxelby submitted an additional report stating that pre-Shot Screen noise levels do "not pose
18 a risk to public health...." This is disputed by a paper titled "Adverse Impacts of Acoustic Startle
19 Response" submitted by Petitioner to the County as part of the Variance application. The County
20 did not respond to this evidence.

21 60. Carlisle quickly provided a detailed rebuttal to Saxelby's letter and, along with ATC
22 representatives, subsequently met with County Planning officials to further discuss the proposed
23 solution. However, the County did not respond to Carlisle's rebuttal. Instead, on December 12,
24 2019, the Development Review Committee recommended that the Zoning Administrator revoke the
25 Variance "due to misrepresentation and/or failure to comply with Placer County Code
26 Section 17.60.100(D)(1) and Condition of Approval #1," and scheduled a public hearing on the issue

27 for December 19, 2019.

- 61. At the hearing, which was chaired by Zoning Administrator Steve Pedretti, Carlisle
2 gave a detailed presentation regarding the plan to fix the reflection issues, including by sloping the

3

4 Shot Screen at 50 degrees, and provided a detailed refutation of Saxelby's report.

62. On January 2, 2020, Pedretti issued a Notice of Decision to revoke the Variance. The
5 Notice of Decision stated that the Variance "shall be revoked due to failure by [the ATC] to use
6 appropriate material for construction, failure to comply with Placer County Code

7 Section 17.60.100(D)(1), and failure to comply with Condition of Approval #1 of the Variance,"

8 based on the "increase of noise to neighboring properties." It also stated that the revocation was
9 exempt from CEQA under section 15061(b)(4) of the CEQA Guidelines. The Decision ordered the
10 removal of the Shot Screen within ninety days from the January 21 effective date.

11 63. On January 8, 2020, the ATC filed an appeal of the revocation ruling with the Board.
12 The ATC pointed out, among other things, that there was a lack of evidence in the administrative
13 record to show that the proposed modifications to the Shot Screen would not be effective to address
14 the noise impacting uprange residents. Specifically, the County's consultant Luke Saxelby failed to
15 provide any analysis or calculations supporting his rejection of the modifications proposed by Carr.
16 On February 7, 2020, Carlisle filed supplemental arguments in support of the appeal. On March 5,
17 2020, Carlisle sent a letter to the Board stating his intent to file this Petition if the
18 rejected. appeal was

19 64. On March 9, 2020, following a public hearing, the Board denied the Appeal. In so
20 doing, the Board found that (a) the Variance "constitutes a grant of privileges inconsistent with the
21 limitations upon other properties in the vicinity and in the same zone district"; and (b) the Variance
22 "resulted in a use of land that fails to comply with the provisions of Placer County Code II
23 Section 17.60.100(D), and Condition of Approval number 1, since it results in the increase of noise
24 to the neighboring properties, and as a result under the circumstances and conditions applied to this
25 particular case, adversely affected public health or safety, is materially detrimental to the public

t P the reflection of acoustic energy off the shot screen." The Board further found that revoking the
2 Variance was categorically exempt from CEQA.

3 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

A (Writ of Mandate - CCP §§ 1085 and/or 1094.5)

5 (Against Respondent Board)
6 65. Petitioner hereby incorporates all paragraphs of this Petition.
7 66. Pursuant to Placer County Code section 17.62.170, the Zoning Administrator "may
8 initiate proceedings to revoke the approval of any land use permit ... in any case where it is
9 determined that the permit was obtained through misrepresentation, or where a use of land has been
10 established or is conducted in a manner that violates or fails to comply with the provisions of this
11 code or a condition of approval, or where the use of land is undertaken in violation of any local,
12 state Or federal law which affects the health, safety, peace, morals or general welfare of the public."
13 On appeal, section 17.61.110(D)(4)(a)(i) provides that the Board "may affirm, affirm in part, or
14 reverse the action, decision or determination that is the subject of the appeal, based upon findings
15  of fact about the particular case. The findings shall identify the reasons for the action on the appeal,
16  and verify the compliance or noncompliance of the subject of the appeal with the provisions of this
17 chapter." Under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5(b), the Board's decision is reviewed for
18 prejudicial abuse of discretion, which "is established if the respondent has not proceeded in the
19 manner required by law, the order or decision is not supported by the findings, or the findings are
20 not supported by the evidence." The Board Action was an abuse of discretion in each respect.

21 67. The Board abused its discretion by failing to proceed in the manner required by law.
22 Specifically, the Board did not comply with Placer County Code provisions governing variance
23  revocation or CEQA provisions requiring environmental review of the County's revocation decision
24 and the ultimate removal of the Shot Screen.

25 68. The Board further abused its discretion because the Board Action was not supported
26 by the Board's findings, which were vague, conclusory and inadequate under controlling law. The

27 Board failed to identify or present evidence sufficient to meet the applicable revocation standards,
28 instead making only a conclusory finding that the Variance "constitutes a grant of privileges

Mallory & Natsis VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; REQUEST FOR INJUNCTIVE
1141616.04/SF RELIEF

inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the vicinity…." and does not comply with
2 section 17.60.100(D) of the Placer County Code, which identifies the conditions under which a
3 variance may be granted, and also did not comply with Condition of Approval #1. The Board did
4 not "identify the reasons for the action on the appeal," nor did it provide "findings of fact about the
5 particular case" to show how the Variance did not comply with section 17.60.100(D) or Condition
6 of Approval #1.

7 a. The Board did not identify the reasons for its action because it did not explain
8 how the Variance "constitutes a grant of privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other

9 properties in the vicinity...' or "verify the compliance or noncompliance of the subject of the appeal
10 with the provisions of this chapter."

11 b. The Board Action was based on increased uprange noise levels. However,
12 Condition of Approval # 1 does not prohibit such increases. It provides: "This Variance (PLN1 8-
13 00258) is approved to allow construction of a noise reducing shot screen (i.e. sound curtain) with
14 maximum height of sixty-eight (68) feet above grade, and a length a of 650 feet, at the Auburn Trap
15 Club. The shot screen shall a be a forest green color, installed at a distance of 70-80 yards from the
16 shooters and will be tilted 3 degrees away from the shooting stations to reflect noise upward. The

17 shot screen shall be located a minimum of 10 feet in front of the intermittent drainage ditch running
18 east to west across the project site. Fourteen posts ranging in height from 42 fect to 68 feet will be
19 fastened with guy wires anchored by 8 foot deep concrete piers to support the shot screen." The
20 Board's findings with respect to Condition of Approval #1 therefore do not support the Board
21 Action.

22 C. Similarly, with respect to 17.60.100(D), the Board stated in conclusory
23 fashion that the Shot Screen "results in the increase of noise to the neighboring properties, and as a

24 result under the circumstances and conditions applied in this particular case, adversely affected
25 public health or safety, is materially detrimental to the public welfare, and injurious to nearby
26 properties and improvements." Nothing in that section, however, provides that uprange noise levels
27 must perfectly conform to pre-Shot Screen levels. Further, despite the Board's apparent concern
28 about increased noise, it refused to allow the it ATC to modify the screen to mitigate the increased

LAW OFFICES

Mallory & Natsis LLP VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; REQUEST FOR INJUNCTIVE
1141616.04/SF RELIEF

1 noise. The Board therefore failed to make findings sufficient to support its decision to revoke the
2 Variance.

3 69. In addition, the Board abused its discretion because its findings were not supported

4 by the evidence in the record. The evidence in the record shows that the Variance was not "obtained

5 through misrepresentation" and was not "established or [] conducted in a manner that violates or
6 fails to comply with the provisions of this code or a condition of approval...." As such, the evidence
7 provided no basis under the applicable zoning laws to revoke the Variance, and the Board therefore
8  abused its discretion when it denied the Appeal.
9 a. The only basis for the Board's conclusion that the uprange noise problems
10 could not be remediated within the contours of the Variance was Luke Saxelby's cursory three-page
11 report dated July 31, 2019, which, without offering any actual analysis, raised some hypothetical
12 questions as to whether the proposed Shot Screen modifications would fully and necessarily return
13 uprange noise to pre-Shot Screen levels. The Board relied on Saxelby's conclusion that it "is

14 unlikely that the [proposed] fix would have satisfactory results at all locations which are
15 experiencing sound reflections." The evidence did not support that decision. As the Board
16 acknowledged in its denial of the Appeal, Saxelby's report merely confirmed that it was not possible
17 to know with absolute certainty whether the modifications would "restore the pre-project
18 I soundscape." The mere lack of absolute certainty does not support a finding that the Variance
19 "constitutes a grant of privileges inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties in the
20 vicinity...." or that it does not comply with section 17.60.100(D) or Condition of Approval #1. The
21 County itself acknowledged as much when it granted the Variance by relying on Mr. Bollard's
22 analysis, which stated only that "reflected sound is not predicted to be significant." In fact, once
23 | Respondents allowed the Shot Screen to be constructed, in great reliance by, and expense to,
24 Petitioner, the Board was legally prohibited from undoing the Variance without evidence and
25 findings clearly supporting the need for its removal. No such evidence was present, nor were such
26 findings made by the Board.

27 b. Further, contrary to the Board's finding, the evidence in the record
28 demonstrates that to the extent the Shot Screen does not already comply, it will likely comply as

LAW OFFICES
lien Matkins Leck Gamble -19-
Mallory & Natsis LLP VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; REQUEST FOR INJUNCTIVE
1141616.04/SF RELIEF

modified with section 17.60.100(D) and Condition of Approval #1. First, Mr. Carr's detailed
2 analysis of June 14, 2019, which includes data regarding numerous specific uprange properties and
3 involved sophisticated modeling, states that the proposed solution would result "in a significant
4 reduction in the reflected noise levels in the surrounding community" and would "potentially
5 reduc[e] noise levels to pre-Shot-Shield levels." Moreover, the County's expert, Mr. Saxelby, agreed
6 that the proposed solution "could reduce noise levels to pre-Shot-Shield levels at these receptors."

7 The evidence, therefore, did not support the Board's finding.

8 70. In sum, the Board Action constituted an abuse of discretion because the Board failed
9 to proceed in the manner required by law, made inadequate, vague and conclusory findings which
10 did not support its decision to deny the Appeal, and made findings not supported by substantial
11 evidence in the record, all to the prejudice of Carlisle and other downrange neighbors. Again, once
12 Respondents allowed the Shot Screen to be constructed, in great reliance by, and expense to,
13 Petitioner, the Board was legally prohibited from undoing that Variance without evidence and
14 findings clearly supporting the need for its removal. No such evidence was present, nor such
15 findings made by the Board.

16 71. The Board Action has significantly harmed and damaged Petitioner, and will
17 continue to do so.

18 72. Petitioner has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law, other than the relief
19 sought in this Petition.

20 73. Accordingly, the Court should set aside the Board Action and direct the Board to
21 enter a new and different decision granting the Appeal.

22 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Writ of Mandate - Failure to Comply with CEQA)
24 (Against Respondents)

25 74. Petitioner hereby incorporates all paragraphs of this Petition.

26 75. Initially, the Zoning Administrator found that the County's decision to revoke the
27 Variance was categorically exempt from CEQA under CEQA Guideline section 15061(b)(4), which
28 creates an exemption where "[t]he project will be rejected or disapproved by a public agency." The

LAW OFFICES
.lien Matkins Leck Gamble -20-
Mallory & Natsis L.I.P VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; REQUEST FOR INJUNCTIVE
1141616.04/SF RELIEF

1 Zoning Administrator misinterpreted and misapplied section 15061(b)(4).

2 76. If the County had denied the ATC's initial application for a variance such that no
3 Shot Screen had been built, that would have constituted the rejection of a project under CEQA

4 Guidelines section 15061(b)(4). But that is not what happened. Instead, the County approved the
Variance and the 68-foot Shot Screen was built. Now, the County has revoked the Variance and
6 ordered the removal of the Shot Screen. By definition, that is not the "rejection of a project."
77. Public Resources Code section 21065 defines a "project" for purposes of CEQA as a
8 (1) discretionary action by a governmental agency that (2) will either have a direct or reasonably
9 foreseeable indirect impact on the environment. CEQA "projects" must undergo environmental
10 review. The County's revocation of the Variance and order requiring the removal of the Shot Screen
11 falls squarely within CEQA's definition of a "project" and therefore requires preparation of an EIR. N
12 To the extent the County assumed that revocation of the Variance would automatically restore

13 conditions to their pre-Shot Screen state, and that revocation of the Variance would therefore be
14 analogous to rejecting the Variance application in the first instance, the County is mistaken, both as
15 a matter of law, and because the conditions have changed since the Shot Screen was built. Among
16 other things, use, including noise and lead pollution, has continued to intensify at the ATC since the
17 Shot Screen was installed. In addition, section 15300.2 of the CEQA Guidelines makes clear that
18 no Categorical Exemption applies when the substantial evidence in the record reveals the presence
19 of an actual, adverse, significant environmental impact, as is the case here. Evidence in the record,
20 and specifically, Carlisle's presentation to the County, shows the increase in intensity that followed

21 the construction of the Shot Screen, and the significant adverse environmental impacts, including
22 noise, light, and lead pollution, that would result if the Shot Screen was removed. The Variance
23 revocation is therefore not categorically exempt from CEQA under CEQA Guideline
24 section 15061(b)(4).

25 78. The Board abused its discretion by misinterpreting and misapplying CEQA in several
26 ways. First, the Board abused its discretion by adopting the Zoning Administrator's erroneous
27 finding that the Variance revocation was exempt under CEQA Guideline section 15061(b)(4). As
28 cxplained above, the Board failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and that finding was

LAW OFFICES
Jlon Matkins Leck Gamble -21-
Mallory & Natsis LLP VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; REQUEST FOR INJUNCTIVE
1141616.04/SF RELIEF

F not supported by the evidence.

2 79. The Board also abused its discretion when it attempted to bolster the Zoning
3 Administrator's finding by layering additional categorical exemptions on top of CEQA Guideline
4 section 15061(b)(4). Even if the Board did not exceed its jurisdiction by adopting supplemental
5 categorical exemption findings, the Board nonetheless abused its discretion in making these findings

6 because they, too, were not made in accordance with the law, and were not supported by the
7 evidence.

8 80. Specifically, the Board found that the Variance revocation was exempt from

9 environmental review under CEQA Guidelines sections 15321(l), which exempts certain
10 enforcement actions by regulatory agencies, and sections 15301 and 15303, which exempt
11 demolition of specified "small structures" and "minor alterations" to or "conversions" of certain
12 existing structures.

13 81. CEQA Guidelines section 15321 does not support the decision because the Variance
14 revocation involves more than a mere regulatory action revoking a permit, and instead requires
15 physical removal of a 68-foot high wall. As such, the exemption does not apply on its face, and
16 there is no evidence in record to support its adoption.
17 82. Nor do CEQA Guidelines sections 15301 or 15303 support the Board's finding that
18 the Variance revocation is exempt from CEQA because the removal of the Shot Screen is not
19 "minor." The Board found that "revocation of the variance and removal of the nonconforming
20 portion of the Shot Screen is demolition of a structure in accordance with Guidelines section 15301
a 21 and constitutes a minor alteration to the land in accordance with Guidelines Section 15303." The
22 "key consideration" in assessing whether a demolition is "minor" under section 15301 "is whether
23 the project involves negligible or no expansion of use." In addition, subsection (1), which discusses
24 demolitions, permits "[d]emolition and removal of individual small structures listed in this
25 subdivision" such "small commercial structure[s] if designed for an occupant load of 30 persons or
26 less," and certain accessory structures such as "garages, carports, patios, swimming pools, and
27 fences." A 68-foot Shot Screen does not fall into any of these categories, and its removal will lead
28  to a substantial "expansion" of use in the form of increased noise, light, and environmental pollution.

-22- LAW OFFICES
Ilen Matkins Leck Gamble Mallory & Natsis LLP VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; REQUEST FOR INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF 1141616.04/SF

Similarly, CEQA Guidelines section 15303 does not exempt "minor alteration[s]" to land. Rather,
2 it exempts "the conversion of existing small structures from one use to another where only minor
3 modifications are made in the exterior of the structure." On its face, that exemption does not apply
4 to the wholesale removal of the Shot Screen. Consequently, the Board abused its discretion when
5 it found that the Variance revocation was exempt from CEQA under CEQA Guidelines
6 sections 15301 and 15303.

7 83. Further, even if revocation of the Variance was otherwise exempt under CEQA
8 Guidelines sections 15321, 15301 or 15303, which it is not, section 15300.2 of the CEQA
9 Guidelines makes clear that no Categorical Exemption applies when the substantial evidence in the
10 record reveals the presence of an actual, adverse, significant environmental impact. As with
11 section 15061(b)(4), that is the case here. Evidence in the record, and specifically, Carlisle's
12 presentation to the County, shows the increase in intensity that followed the construction of the Shot
13 Screen, and the significant adverse environmental impacts, including noise, light, and lead pollution,
14 that would result if the Shot Screen was removed.

15 84. No evidence in the record shows that the environmental impacts of removing the
16 Shot Screen would be restored to their pre-Shot Screen state. Consequently, the substantial evidence
17 in the record precludes the application of any Categorical Exemption in this case.

18 85. In sum, the Board's denial of the Appeal violated fundamentally important provisions
19 of CEQA by erroneously relying on categorical exemptions that do not apply to this project. The
20 denial of the Appeal was therefore an abuse of the Board's discretion.

21 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

22 (Public Nuisance)

23 (Against the ATC)

24 86. Petitioner hereby incorporates all paragraphs of this Petition.

25 87. Placer County Code section 17.040.030 defines "Nuisance" to mean: "(1) any
26 conditions declared by a statute of the state of California or by an ordinance of Placer County to be
27 a nuisance; (2) any public nuisance known at common law or equity; (3) any conditions dangerous
28  to human life, unsafe, or detrimental to the public health or safety; (4) any use of land, buildings, or

1 premises established, operated, or maintained contrary to or in violation of any of the provisions of
2 Chapters 5, 8, 12, 15, 16, 17 or 18 of the Placer County Code."

3 88. The ATC, by failing to limit use at its facilities to pre-2006 levels, by failing to obtain
4 a minor use permit as required by Placer County Code section 17.60.120(A), and by creating
5 intolerable levels of noise, light, and other environmental pollution, created conditions that were

6 harmful to health, indecent and offensive to senses, and obstructed the free use of property so as to
7 interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property. In addition, the ATC's operation
without a minor use as required by section 17.60.120(A), alone, constitutes a nuisance per se under
9 Placer County law.

10 89. The harmful conditions created by the ATC affected a substantial number of people
11 at the same time, including Carlisle as well as other Placer County residents living downrange from
12 the ATC.

13 90. An ordinary person would be reasonably annoyed or disturbed by the conditions
14 created by the ATC.

15 91. The seriousness of the harm caused by the conditions outweighs the social utility of
16 the ATC's conduct.

17 92. Carlisle did not consent to the ATC's conduct.

18 93. Carlisle suffered and continues to suffer harm that was different from the type of
19 harm suffered by the general public. Special injury is not required, however, with respect to a per
20 se public nuisance based on violation of a County ordinance.

21 94. The ATC's conduct was a substantial factor in causing Carlisle's harm.

22 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Private Nuisance)

24 (Against the ATC)

25 95. Petitioner hereby incorporates all paragraphs of this Petition.
26 96. Carlisle owns certain real property located downrange of the ATC.

27 97. The ATC, by failing to limit use at its facilities to pre-2006 levels, by failing to obtain
28 a minor use permit as required by Placer County Code section 17.60.120(A), and by creating

intolerable levels of noise, light, and other environmental pollution, created conditions that were
2 harmful to health, indecent and offensive to senses, and obstructed the free use of property so as to
3 interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life or property.

4 98. The conditions created by the ATC interfered with and continue to interfere with
5 Carlisle's use and enjoyment of his property.

6 99. An ordinary person would be reasonably annoyed or disturbed by the conditions.

7 100. Carlisle did not consent to the ATC's conduct.

8 101. Carlisle suffered and continues to suffer harm.

9 102. The ATC's conduct was a substantial factor in causing Carlisle's harm.
10 103. The seriousness of the harm caused to Carlisle by the condition outweighs the public
11 benefit of the ATC's conduct.

12 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

13 (Declaratory Relief)

14 (Against Respondents and the ATC)

15 104. Petitioner hereby incorporates all paragraphs of this Petition.

16 105. Real and actual controversies have arisen and now exist between Petitioner and
17 Respondents, and the ATC, regarding each party's respective rights, duties, and obligations in
18 connection with the continued operation of the ATC.

19 106. Declaratory relief would promote the public interest, vindicate Petitioner's rights, and
20 clarify the rights and obligations of each party in light of the ongoing dispute.

21 107. Petitions has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law other than the relief sought
22 in this action.

23 108. Accordingly, Petitioner seeks declaratory relief as follows: (a) A declaration that
24 that the Board erroneously denied the ATC's appeal and must instead grant the Appeal so as to
25 permit modification of the Shot Screen as proposed by Carlisle; (b) A declaration that Respondents
26 may not enforce the order to remove the Shot Screen pending resolution of this action; (c) a
27 declaration that the ATC may not remove the Shot Screen pending resolution of this action; and (d)

2 and private nuisance and must be abated by restoring use to its level prior to January 1, 2006.
3 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

4 (Injunctive Relief)

5 (Against Respondents)

6 109. Petitioner hereby incorporates all paragraphs of this Petition.

7 110. Unless Respondents are preliminarily and permanently restrained by this Court from
8 enforcing the Variance revocation and order to remove the Shot Screen, Petitioner will suffer
9 irreparable harm.

10 111. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law, and injunctive relief is
11 expressly authorized by Sections 526 and 731 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

12 112. Petitioner is more likely than not to prevail on the underlying causes of action
13 asserted in this Petition and Complaint for Damages.

14 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Injunctive Relief)

16 (Against the ATC)

17 113. Petitioner hereby incorporates all paragraphs of this Petition.

18 114. Unless the ATC is preliminarily and permanently restrained by this Court from
19 complying with the Variance revocation order and from removing the Shot Screen, and unless the
20 ATC is further preliminarily and permanently restrained from continuing to operate at a use level
21 exceeding that which existed prior to January 1, 2006, Petitioner will suffer irreparable harm.

22 115. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law, and injunctive relief is
23 expressly authorized by Sections 526 and 731 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

24 116. Petitioner is more likely than not to prevail on the underlying causes of action
25 asserted in this Petition and Complaint for Damages.
