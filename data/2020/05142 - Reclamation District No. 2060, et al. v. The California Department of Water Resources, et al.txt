PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

INTRODUCTION 1

2 1. This action challenges the November 2, 2020 certification of the Environmental
Impact Report ("EIR") and associated approvals by the California Department of Water Resources

4 (hereinafter "DWR" or "Respondent") for the Lookout Slough Tidal Habitat Restoration and
Flood Improvement Project ("Project"). DWR prepared and certified an EIR for the Project that
6 fails to comport with the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public

7 Resources Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), and CEQA's implementing guideline
8 regulations, 14 California Code of Regulations section 15000 et seq. ("Guidelines").

9 2. The certification of the EIR and associated approvals of the Project violated CEQA.
10 The CEQA violations include, but are not limited to, DWR failing to revise and recirculate the
11 EIR; improperly piecemealing environmental review of a larger coordinated project; failing to

ITI (NVIE AENMOI 12 adequately discuss consistency with applicable general and regional plans; relying on an
13 inadequate project description; failing to adequately identify, analyze, and mitigate significant
14 impacts to the environment; failing to adequately consider alternatives; and failing to adequately
15 respond to comments.

16 3. By this action, Reclamation District No. 2060 (RD 2060") and Reclamation
17 District No. 2068 ("RD 2068") (hereinafter collectively referred to as "Petitioners"), seek a
18 I peremptory writ of mandate to set aside DWR's certification of the EIR and the associated
19 decisions, findings, and approvals for the Project. Petitioners also seck to enjoin any further
20 approvals, funding, permits, construction, and any other action in furtherance of the Project
21 pending full compliance with CEQA.

PARTIES 22

23 4. Petitioner Reclamation District No. 2060 ("RD 2060") is a reclamation district
24 formed under the laws of the State of California pursuant to Division 15, section 50000 et seq., of
25 the California Water Code. RD 2060 was formed in 1922 to provide flood control, and it does so
26 by constructing and maintaining levees, drainage canals, pumping plants, and other infrastructure.
27 RD 2060 serves landowners adjacent to the Project, and consists of approximately 6,900 acres
28 within the Delta Lowlands in Solano County, located on Hastings Tract, along Cache Slough, and

2 1668147v16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1. immediately opposite of the proposed Project site. RD 2060 holds an appropriative water right
2 license to divert water from Barker Slough, Cache Slough, Lindsay Slough, Ulatis Creek, and
3 Hastings Cut, and also acts to protect the diversion of water by its landowners under their own
4 rights.

5 5. Petitioner Reclamation District No. 2068 ("RD 2068") is reclamation district
6 formed under the laws of the State of California pursuant to Division 15, section 50000 et seq., of
7 the California Water Code. RD 2060 was first organized in 1924, and provides irrigation,
8 drainage, and flood control to approximately 13,200 acres in Solano and Yolo Counties. The
9 District is adjacent to the northern boundary of the proposed Project, and the proposed Project is
10 fully within Reclamation District No. 2098 ("RD 2098"). RD 2068 and RD 2098 make up U.S.
11 Army Corps of Engineer (USACE) Levee Unit 109 (West Levee of Yolo Bypass and East Levee
d'TT INVIE AHNMOC 12 of Cache Slough) of the Sacramento River Flood Control Project, and are therefore hydrologically
13 connected.

14 6. Respondent is, and at all times mentioned herein was, a governmental agency and
15 political subdivision of the State of California, formed and existing under the California Water
16 Code, with its principal place of business in the County of Sacramento. DWR is the lead agency
17 under CEQA for the preparation of the EIR and for approval of the Project.
18 7. Petitioners are informed and believe that Real Party in Interest Ecosystem
19 Investment Partners, LLC ("EIP" or "Real Party in Interest"), is a Delaware limited-liability
20 company doing business in California. EIP was identified as the Project Applicant in the draft
proposed Project property in the final EIR 21 EIR ("Draft EIR"), and as the current owner of the
22 ("Final EIR").

23 8. Does through 50 are persons or entities unknown to Petitioners at this time who
24 may be necessary parties to this action. Petitioners are informed and believe, and based thereon
25 allege, that each of the Does may have a legal interest in the outcome of these proceedings.
26 Petitioners will amend this Petition specifically to identify each such person or entity, if and when
27 their identities become known.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

2 Flood Control and Development in the North Delta

3 9. Beginning approximately 160 years ago, farmers within the area now comprising
the north Delta' began reclaiming lands from seasonal flooding, appropriating water to beneficial
use, and establishing vibrant agricultural communities. To accomplish that feat, levees and
drainage systems were constructed across the region, both by private individuals and by
7 reclamation districts formed pursuant to the State Flood Control Act and Reclamation District Act,

8 enacted in 1861.

9 10. Reclamation districts are some of the oldest forms of local government in
10 California. They were established initially for the purpose of reclaiming swamp and overflowed
11 lands for farming and other economic activities after the State accepted title from the federal

d'II INVHE AINMOG 12 government to more than 2 million acres under the Swamp Lands Act of 1850 on the condition
13 that the lands would be reclaimed (drained) so that they could be utilized for economically
14 productive purposes. Without continued drainage services performed by reclamation districts and
15 the repair of levee breaches and the dewatering of flooded lands, many of the lands in the north
16 Delta would revert to swamp and marshland, which would prevent economic activity and create
17 human health hazards from exposure to illnesses resulting from establishment of permanent and
18 pervasive mosquito breeding grounds.

19 11. The material used to build levees in the north Delta was largely dredged from local
20 channels and placed as new levees or placed on existing levees, resulting in highly yariable strata

21 within individual levees. Many of the levees in the area in and around the Project were
22 constructed to USACE standards, as a part of the Sacramento River Flood Control Project and San
23 Joaquin River Flood Control Project (now collectively known as the State Plan of Flood Control),

24 and have not been improved since then.

25

26

27 As used in this Petition, the term "Delta" means the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta as defined in 28 California Water Code section 12220

4 1668147v16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 12, The State has long recognized that the Delta is an agricultural region of great value

2 to the State and Nation, and that the continued cultivation of Delta lands is of significant value.

3 (See Pub. Resources Code § 29703.) The continued dedication and retention of Delta land in
4 agricultural production contributes to the preservation and enhancement of open space and habitat
5 values. (Ibid.) Approximately two-thirds of the acreage in the Delta is designated as a primary

6 zone identified for protection from the intrusion of nonagricultural uses under Public Resources
7 Code section 29703.

8 13. In enacting the Delta Reform Act, the Legislature recognized that the leveed islands

9 and tracts of the Delta are "floodprone areas of critical statewide significance due to the public
10 safety risks and the costs of public emergency responses to floods," and that the improvement and
11 ongoing maintenance of that levee system "is a matter of continuing urgency to protect farmlands,
d'TIONVJE AHNMOC 12 population centers, the state's water quality, and significant natural resource and habitat areas of
13 the delta." (Pub. Resources Code § 29704.)

14 14. Out of the 1,100 miles of levees in the Delta, there are approximately 370 miles of
15 State Plan of Flood Control (SPFC) project levees. DWR's Flood Management Division is
16 charged with protecting the public from dangerous flooding and administers an integrated flood
17 management and emergency response system throughout California, including flood forecasting
18 and emergency response operations center as well as responsibility for annual inspection and
19 reporting on all 1,600 miles of SPFC project levees. DWR also administers the Delta Levees
20 Maintenance Subventions funding program for the Central Valley Flood Protection Board
21 (CVFPB), which reimburses reclamation districts in the Delta for maintenance of all non-project
22 levees in the Delta and project levees located in the Primary Zone boundaries of the legal Delta.
23 15. RD 2068 and RD 2060 are local agencies providing flood control, levee
24 maintenance, drainage service, and irrigation service in the Project area. Petitioners each hold
25 appropriative water rights, either individually or on behalf of landowners, to divert water for the
26 use and benefit of lands within their boundaries. There are a variety of critical agricultural and
27 municipal diversion points within and immediately adjacent to RD 2060. RD 2068 has the largest
28 agricultural diversion in the immediately surrounding Project area, with a maximum capacity of

5 1668147v16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

300 cubic feet per second, diverting water less than 1.5 miles northwest of the Project area and
2 drawing from Haas Slough.
The Proposed Project

4 16. The proposed Project is located in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, and involves
three properties totaling 3,400 acres in unincorporated southeastern Solano County, California,

6 with a small portion of work extending into Yolo County.

7 17. The CVFPB adopted the Central Valley Flood Protection Plan in 2012, and the

8 Central Valley Flood Protection Plan 2017 Update proposed options for increasing flood capacity
through multi-benefit projects.

10 18. The proposed Project is intended to help fulfill objectives in the Central Valley
11 Flood Protection Plan and would widen a portion of the Yolo Bypass, including by constructing a

JTT ONVHE AINMOC 12 new setback levee along Duck Slough and Liberty Island Road, breaching and partially degrading
13 the existing levee at Shag Slough to provide tidal and flood connectivity with Duck Slough, and
14 enhancing the existing Cache/Hass Slough Levee to prevent increased water-surface elevations in
15 the Cache Slough Complex.

16 19. The levee surrounding the Project site consists of three levee segments that are
17 components of the USACE Levee Unit 109/RD 2098 systems: Hass Slough, located within and
18 along the western edge of the proposed Project site; Cache Slough, located along the western and
19 southern edges of the proposed Project site; and Shag Slough, within and along the eastern edge of
20 the proposed Project site. As recognized by the Draft EIR, "[l]ands within and adjacent to the
21 Proposed Project Site are presently protected by levees maintained by RDs 2098, 2068, 2060, and
22 2104."

23 20. The Final EIR identified a EIP as a contractor to DWR that owns the proposed
24 Project property and that will implement certain mitigation measures for the Project. Petitioners

25 are informed and believe that EIP has a "pay-for-success" contract with DWR, by which DWR
26 | will make payments to EIP only when EIP completes certain contract requirements, and that the
27 contract is potentially worth more than $100 million.

28

6 1668147vI6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

21. RD 2068 and RD 2098 are interconnected and, as further recognized by the Draft

2 EIR, "[f]lood control systems in the vicinity of the Proposed Project Site are mostly managed by

3 RD 2098 and RD 2068. These entities are charged with maintenance and operation of levees,

4 sloughs, canals, pumps, and other flood protection structures within their area of jurisdiction."

5 CEQA PROCESS AND PROJECT APPROVAL

6 22. On or about March 21, 2019, DWR filed a Notice of Preparation (NOP) and Initial
7 Study (IS) with the State Clearinghouse (State Clearinghouse Number (SCH No.) 2019039136).

8 The NOP stated that DWR planned to prepare a draft EIR, and indicated that the IS had found no
potential for significant impacts to the following environmental issue areas: Aesthetics; Energy;
10 Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHGs); Land Use/Planning; Noise; Population/Housing; Recreation;

11 Transportation; Utilities/Service Systems; Wildfire; and Mandatory Findings of Significance.

12 23. d'TT (NVIE AINMOC On April 19, 2019, Petitioners submitted separate comment letters to DWR
13 regarding the NOP.

14 24. On or about December 16, 2019, the Draft EIR was filed with the State
15 Clearinghouse, commencing the 60-day public comment period.

16 25. On January 22, 2020, at the public meeting DWR held to receive comments on the
17 Draft EIR, the Petitioners made separate comments.

18 26. On February 14, 2020, Petitioners submitted separate comment letters to DWR
19 regarding the Draft EIR, as had a number of other persons, entities, and public agencies.

20 27. DWR released the Final EIR for the Project in or about October 2020. The Final

21 EIR failed to adequately address Petitioners' concerns, or the concerns raised in comments made by

22 other members of the public, and failed to comply with CEQA in a variety of respects.

23 28. On or about November 2, 2020, DWR certified the EIR and approved the Project.

24 29. On or about November 3, 2020, DWR filed a Notice of Determination (NOD) for

25 the Project. The NOD states that the Project will a not have a significant effect on the environment,
a 26 that mitigation measures were included as a condition of approval of the Project, that a mitigation
27 reporting or monitoring plan was adopted, that findings were made pursuant to CEQA, and that a
28 statement of overriding considerations was not adopted.

1668147v16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

30. This Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set aside DWR's
approvals of the Project under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5 and Public

4 Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5, 21168.7, and 21168.9.

31. This Court also has jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 527,

6 and 1094.5(g) to enjoin and stay DWR and Real Party in Interest from proceeding with any further
7 approvals, disbursement of funding, or commencement of construction activities related to the
Project.

32. Venue is proper in Solano County Superior Court under section 393 of the Code of
10 Civil Procedure, because some part of the Project will be constructed in Solano County and will
11  have a direct and substantial effect on the environment and persons in that county.

12 PROCEDURAL ALLEGATIONS dTT INVAE AINMOC 13 33. This Petition is timely filed and served in accordance with Public Resources Code

14 section 21167.

15 34. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
16 (21167.5 by serving a written notice of Petitioners' intention to commence this action on DWR
17 | prior to filing this action. A copy of the written notice and proof of service is attached hereto as

18 Exhibit A.

19 35. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
20 21167.6 by concurrently filing their election to prepare the record of proceedings relating to this
21 action.

22 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

23 36. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to this filing and have
24 I exhausted the available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

25 37. Petitioners actively participated in the administrative process leading up to DWR's
26 approval of the Project and issuance of the NOD, and Petitioners stated their objections to DWR's
27 actions before the close of the public hearing on the Project before DWR's filing of the NOD.

28

8 1668147v16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

A 38. All issues raised in this Petition were directly raised orally or in writing by

2 Petitioners or other members of the public, including public agencies, during the administrative
3 process before the close of the public hearing on the Project before DWR's issuance of the NOD.

39. Any further requests by Petitioners to DWR for relief, having been previously

5 made, would be futile.

40. Petitioners have fully exhausted all administrative remedies in that the
7 determination by DWR is final and no further administrative appeal procedures are provided by

8 State and local law.

9 STANDING

10 41. Petitioners have standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because they
11 hold a beneficial interest in the action. Specifically, the Project may adversely affect the

J'TI INVIE AHNMOI 12 Petitioners' ability to provide flood control, maintain flood-control infrastructure, provide
13 irrigation and drainage, and exercise and protect water rights and water diversions by Petitioners
14 and others within their districts. Petitioners and the entities they serve will be directly injured by
15 DWR's failure to comply with CEQA in connection with the Project, as their operations will be
16 impacted by significant environmental effects that have not been adequately analyzed or disclosed.

17 42. By certifying an EIR and approving the Project in violation of CEQA, DWR has
18 placed the Project area, the area surrounding the Project, and the water resources relied upon by
19 Petitioners at significant risk of flood damage and impairment. Thus, Petitioners have standing to
20 assert the claims raised in this Petition.

21 43. Further, Petitioners have standing in the public interest because this case involves
22 public rights and the enforcement of public duties. Specifically, DWR owed a mandatory duty to
23 comply with the procedural and substantive requirements of CEQA.

24 STAY AND INJUNCTION

25 44. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth
26 above.

27 45. Project construction has already begun. Irreparable harm to Petitioners, the general
28 public, and the environment will occur due to the environmental impacts resulting from the Project

1668147v16 0
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F and DWR's illegal actions in violation of CEQA. Continuance of the Project during litigation

2 would also produce waste and great or irreparable injury.

3 46. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
4  unless this Court grants the requested stay or temporary and permanent injunctions as well as a
5 writ of mandate to require DWR to set aside its approval of the Project.

6 47. A stay or injunction of DWR actions relating to the Project would not be against
7 the public interest because DWR is required by CEQA to conduct an adequate environmental
8 review of the Project before taking any actions to approve it, because construction and operation

9 of the Project would likely have significant impacts on the environment, and because neither
10 | DWR nor Real Party in Interest will be harmed by a stay or injunction.

ATTORNEYS' FEES 11

12 48. Petitioners are bringing this action in the public interest, and are not seeking any ITI UNVHE AHNMOC 13 relief greater than or different from the relief sought for the general public. If successful, this
14 action would enforce the mandates of CEQA and thus enforce the public's right to adequate
15 environmental review under that statute.

16 49. Petitioners are entitled to receive attorneys' fees from DWR pursuant to Code of
17 Civil Procedure section 1021.5 because this action involves the enforcement of important rights
18 affecting the public interest. This action will, among other things, confer a significant benefit on
19 the general public and a large class of persons, and the necessity and financial burden of

20 enforcement against another public entity makes an award of fees appropriate.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 21

22 (Violation of CEQA - Failure to Recirculate EIR)

23 50. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth
24  above.

25 51. CEQA requires the lead agency to recirculate an EIR when significant new
26 information is added to the EIR after public notice is given of the availability of the draft EIR for
27 public review but before certification of the final EIR.

28

10 1668147v16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

,

1 52. DWR was required to recirculate the EIR after adding significant new information

2 to the EIR after public notice had been given of the availability of the Draft EIR for public review,
3 and that significant new information includes, but is not limited to, significant revisions to the
4 project description, impacts analysis, and mitigation measures, as well as new and different
5 hydrodynamic and electrical conductivity modeling to analyze salinity impacts.

6 53. DWR failed to recirculate the EIR after public notice was given of the availability
7 of the Draft BIR for public review and thus deprived the public of a meaningful opportunity to

8 comment on those aspects of the Final EIR, including substantial adverse environmental effects of
9 the Project and feasible mitigation or alternatives that DWR declined to implement.

10 54. For all of the reasons stated above, DWR's failure to comply with CEQA
11 constitutes prejudicial abuse of discretion and Petitioners pray for the relief requested below.

12 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION dTI ONVHE AHNMOC 13 (Violation of CEQA - Piecemealing)

14 55. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth
15 above.

16 56. CEQA forbids piecemeal review of the significant environmental impacts of a
17 Project and declares that it is improper to segment a single project into multiple small projects for
18 the purpose of analyzing environmental impacts. Separate activities are considered a single

19 CEQA project and required to be reviewed together where, for example, both activities are integral

20 parts of the satne project.

21 57. The Project defined in the Project Description and reviewed in the EIR is part of a
22 || larger project that includes a series of restoration projects proposed by DWR in the Delta that are
23 geographically near to one another and ecologically and hydrologically connected. These projects
24 are part of a single coordinated undertaking, and CEQA requires that they be reviewed together
25 through a single EIR.

26 58. For all of the reasons stated above, DWR's failure to comply with CEQA
27 constitutes prejudicial abuse of discretion and Petitioners pray for the relief requested below.

28

11 1668147v16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of CEQA - Consistency with Applicable General and Regional Plans)

3 59. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth
4 above.

5 60. CEQA requires that an EIR discuss any inconsistencies between a proposed project
6 and applicable general plans, specific plans, and regional plans.

7 61. The EIR fails to adequately discuss inconsistencies with such plans including, but

8 not limited to, the Delta Plan, the Solano County General Plan, and the Solano County Climate
9 Action Plan.

10 62. For all of the reasons stated above, DWR's failure to comply with CEQA
11 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and Petitioners pray for the relief requested below.
12 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION d'TT UNVHE AINMOG 13 (Violation of CEQA - Inadequate Project Description)
14 63. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth
15 above.

16 64. CEQA requires an EIR to have an accurate, stable, and finite project description
17 that includes the entire project and foresecable expansions of the project. Such a project
18 description is necessary for adequate consideration of a project's environmental impacts,
19 mitigation measures, and alternatives.

20 65. The EIR's project description fails to comply with CEQA. These failures include,
21 but are not limited to:

22 a. Failure to clearly explain whether the Project is a public project that will be
23 carried out by DWR or a private project that will be carried out by EIP. Failure to clearly explain
24 | the relationship between DWR and EIP with regard to the Project creates uncertainties as to many
25 components of the Project, including which entity will be responsible for implementing mitigation
26 measures and how the mitigation monitoring and reporting plan will be enforced;

27 b. Failure to address the reasonably foreseeable need to relocate water-
28 diversion infrastructure;

12 1658147v16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 C. Failure to address impacts to surrounding levees, bridges, and other

2 structures due to increased areas of inundation and the effects of wind;

3 d. Failure to address how and where the Project will dispose of huge volumes
4  of excavated material; and

e. Long-term Project impacts on RD 2098, including potential economic

6 effects that would render RD 2098 unable to properly maintain district infrastructure, which would
7 have significant physical impacts on neighboring districts, including RD 2060 and RD 2068.

8 66. The EIR's project description also substantially shifted after the Draft EIR was

9 circulated for public comment. This fundamental shift in the project description, as well as
10 addition of and substantial revisions to mitigation measures, violates CEQA's requirement that a
11 project description be stable and finite and constitutes a failure to proceed in the manner required

JTI INVHE AINMOI 12 by law.

13 67. The defects and omissions above render the project description inadequate and
14 infect the EIR's analysis of environmental impacts, mitigation measures, and alternatives.

15 68. For all of the reasons stated above, DWR's failure to comply with CEQA
16 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and Petitioners pray for the relief requested below.

17 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Violation of CEQA - Inadequate Identification and Analysis of Impacts)

19 69. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth

20 above.

21 Agriculture

22 70. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's
23 significant impacts to agriculture. The EIR's failures include, but are not limited to, the following.

24 71. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's
25 significant impacts to the salinity and water quality of water used by surrounding agricultural uses.
26 Changes in salinity and bromide will impact operation of agricultural users and the drinking water
27 supply of municipal water suppliers in the vicinity of the Project. The EIR's conclusion that
28 impacts to municipal and agricultural water suppliers are less than significant is not supported by

13 1668147v16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 data, modeling, and/or analysis. Water diversions have the potential to impact neighboring

2 agricultural uses due to potential increases in populations of protected species and restrictions on
3 the use of pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, and other agricultural chemicals, and CEQA requires
4 those impacts to be analyzed and mitigated.

5 72. The Project converts agricuitural land currently in production to non-agricultural
6 uses. This conversion constitutes a significant impact to the environment that is not adequately

7 mitigated.

8 73. Mitigation measures for agricultural impacts are inadequate. For example, AG-la
9 is inadequate because it does not include specific criteria or a standard of performance. Mitigation
10 Measure AG-la states that DWR will install irrigation infrastructure to convert "all or part" of a
11 specific property to Prime Farmland. This mitigation measure is vague and does not commit

ITI UNVYE AINMOŒ 12 DWR to a measurable criteria or performance standard.

13 74. The EIR is also inadequate for failure to disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the
14 impacts associated with conversion of privately-owned farmland to habitat uses.

15 Biological Resources

16 75. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's
17 significant impacts to biological resources. The EIR's failures include, but are not limited to, the
18 following.

19 76. The EIR conclusions and predictions regarding habitat restoration timelines are not
20 supported by substantial evidence.

21 77. The mitigation measures, including BIO-1, BIO-4, and BIO5G are inadequate to
22 mitigate the Project's significant impacts to biological resources.

23 78. The EIR fails to consider operational impacts where there are entrainment hazards
24  to endangered fish species.

25 79. The EIR fails to impose feasible mitigation for existing water diversion facilities.

26 80. The EIR's disclosure, analysis, and/or mitigation of permanent impacts to Western
27 Pond Turtle nesting habitat is inadequate.

28

14 1658147v1
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Flooding and Hazards

2 81. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's

3 significant impacts on flooding, flood storage, and emergency access. The EIR's failures include,

4 but are not limited to, the failure to disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the impacts of the

5 conversion of a county road into a full-height levee and its potential to result in inadequate

6 emergency access and/or impede or redirect flood flows and the impacts of the significant
7 modifications to the flood storage capacity of USACE Levee Unit 109, which could result in the
8 l permanent loss of 40,000 acre-feet of storage and the loss of a pre-determined levee cut location
9| identified in the Emergency Response Plan.

10 Hydrology and Water Quality

11 82. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's

JTI UNVHE AINMOC 12 significant water quality and hydrology impacts. The EIR's failures include, but are not limited
13 to, the following.

14 83. The EIR fails to disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the impacts to water quality and
15 water levels and the potential to reduce the ability for local agricultural entities to meet their water
16 | needs, and potentially reduce agricultural productivity in the area.

17 84. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's
18 significant impacts to methylmercury concentrations, which already exceeds total maximum daily

19 load at the Project site.

20 85. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's water
21 quality impacts associated with invasive aquatic plants, which negatively impact fish species such
22 as Delta Smelt and Chinook salmon.

23 86. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's
24 significant impacts to salinity, bromide, dissolved organic carbon, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and
25 water temperature.

26 87. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's impacts
27  to the local and regional flood plains as well as to the FEMA 100-year flood plain (i.e. increase
28 base flood elevations).

15 1668147vt6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

88. EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's impacts of
2 additional stress on flood-control infrastructure, such as hydraulic-sheer stresses that have
3 potential to cause erosion.

89. The EIR's description of existing hydrology is inadequate and/or inaccurate.

5 Water Supply

90. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's
7 significant impacts on water supply. The EIR's failures include, but are not limited to, the
8  following.

9 91. The EIR improperly fails to discuss the reasonably foresecable consequences with
10 regard to critical infrastructure used for agricultural and municipal water suppliers, and the
11 likelihood that indirect Project effects will impair rights of other water users in the vicinity due to

JTI (NVAE AHNMOI 12 physical or legal limitations on pumping.

13 92. The EIR is unclear on what water will be used to inundate the land within Project
14 boundaries and whether the diversion of that water will impact the supply available to other users
15 in the Project vicinity.

Recreation 16

17 93. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's
18 significant impacts to recreation. The EIR's failures include, but are not limited to, the failure to
19 adequately address loss of access to informal bank fishing on Shag Slough along Liberty Island
20 Road, and impacts to recreation from limiting public access and vacating the right of way.
21 Transportation

22 94. The EIR. fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's
23 significant impacts to transportation. The EIR's failures include, but are not limited to, the failure
24 to properly disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate impacts on emergency ingress/egress from
25 construction and abandonment of Liberty Island Road, the sole access to RD 2068 pumping
26 plant.

Utilities 27

28 95. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's

16 1658147v16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 significant impacts regarding utilities. The EIR's failures include, but are not limited to, the
2 failure to address the potential need to relocate existing water-diversion facilities, the failure to
3 adequately address impacts to buried gas lines and above-ground power lines, and the failure to
4 adequately address impacts from relocating power lines.

5 Cumulative Impacts

6 96. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's
7 cumulative impacts. The EIR's failures include, but are not limited to, the failure to adequately
8 analyze the impacts of numerous reasonably foresecable regional water supply and restoration
9 projects.

10 97. For all of the reasons stated above, DWR's failure to comply with CEQA
11 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and Petitioners pray for the relief requested below.
12 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION d'TT UNVHE AHNMOO 13 (Violation of CEQA - Inadequate Consideration of Alternatives)
14 98. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth
15 above.

16 99. CEQA requires an EIR to describe a reasonable range of alternatives to a project,
17 which would feasibly attain most of the basic project objectives but avoid or substantially lessen
18 any of the significant effects of the project, and evaluate the comparable merits of the alternatives.
19 The EIR should describe the rationale for selecting the alternatives to be discussed, and the EIR
20 must include sufficient information about each alternative to allow meaningful evaluation,
21 analysis, and comparison with the proposed project.
22 100. The EIR fails to identify a reasonable range of alternatives, including off-site
23 alternatives and alternatives reducing environmental impacts, such as those to agriculture, and fails
24  to include sufficient information about each alternative, including regarding the environmental
25 impacts of the No Channel Alternative, which is identified as the environmentally superior
26 alternative.

27 101. For all of the reasons stated above, DWR's failure to comply with CEQA
28 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and Petitioners pray for the relief requested below.

17 1668147v16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of CEQA - Inadequate Responses to Comments)

102. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth

4 above.

103. CEQA requires a lead agency to provide a written response to all public comments
received on a draft EIR during the public-comment period and raising significant environmental
issues. A lead agency must provide good-faith, reasoned responses, and cannot simply provide
conclusory statements that are unsupported by factual information.

104. The Final EIR's responses to comments fail to satisfy CEQA's requirements, and
10 fail to provide good-faith and reasoned responses to comments.

11 105. For all of the reasons stated above, DWR's failure to comply with CEQA

d'TI INVHE AINMOC 12 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and Petitioners pray for the relief requested below

13 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

14 WHEREFORE, Petitioners respectfully pray for the following relief:

15 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing DWR to:

16 a. Vacate and set aside its approval of the Project and all related approvals;

17 b. Vacate and set aside certification of the Final EIR for the Project;

18 c. Comply with CEQA and the Guidelines and to take any other action as

19 required by Public Resources Code section 21168.9; and

20 d. Suspend any and all activity pursuant to DWR's approval of the Project,
21 including disbursement of funding for the Project, until DWR has complied

22 with all requirements of CEQA and all other applicable laws, policies,

23 ordinances, and regulations as are directed by this Court pursuant to Public

24 Resources Code section 211689;

25 2. For a stay, temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent
26 injunction restraining DWR and Real Parties in Interest, and all persons working on their behalf,
27 from issuing any permits or approvals, permitting or undertaking any construction, or taking any

28

18 I668147v16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 other action in furtherance of the Project that may result in a change or alteration in the physical
2 environment pending completion of this litigation and full compliance with CEQA;
3 3. For Petitioners' costs of suit;

4 4. For Petitioners' reasonable attorneys' fees as authorized by Code of Civil
