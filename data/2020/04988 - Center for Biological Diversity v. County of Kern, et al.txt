Printed on Recycled Paper PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the decision of Kern County and its Board of Supervisors
("Respondents") to approve the Supplemental Recirculated Environmental Impact Report

4 ("SREIR") for the Grapevine Specific and Community Plan (the "Project"). The Project will

5 include 12,000 dwelling units, up to 5.1 million square feet of commercial land uses, and a

6 development footprint of 4,643 acres.

7 2. Petitioner CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY ("Petitioner" or "Center")

8 demonstrated throughout the administrative process that the Project will have significant

9 impacts on air quality, public health, greenhouse gases ("GHGs"), special status species, and

10 traffic, among other impacts. Nonetheless, the SREIR fails to disclose or adequately evaluate

11 these environmental impacts or identify effective mitigation measures, rendering the document
12 inadequate under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code
13 sections 21000 et seq.

14 3. The SREIR underestimates the air quality and public health impacts of the Project

15 by misapplying the CalEEMod model, and inputting assumptions into the model that are
16 incorrect or inconsistent with the Project or its mitigation measures. This leads the SREIR to

17 paint a misleading picture of the air quality and public health impacts of the Project for the

18 development scenarios considered in the SREIR.

19 4. The SREIR is also deficient because it does not include analysis of impacts to

20 special status species such as the San Joaquin kit fox and blunt-nosed leopard lizard based upon

21 the current studies and data. The SREIR likewise fails to consider alternatives or mitigation

22 strategies to these species based upon the best available science and data.

23 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

24 5. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1094.5 of the Code

25 of Civil Procedure.

26 6. This Court also has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1085 of the

27 Code of Civil Procedure, and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.

28 7. Venue for this action properly lies in the Kern County Superior Court because

Printed on Recycled Paper 2 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Respondents and the proposed site of the Project are located in the County. Many of the

2 significant environmental impacts of the Project that are the subject of this lawsuit would occur

3 in Kern County, and the Project would impact the interests of Kern County residents

4 PARTIES

5 8. Petitioner Center for Biological Diversity is a non-profit, public interest

6 environmental organization dedicated to the preservation of native species and their habitats

7 through science, policy, and environmental law. The Center has approximately 68,000

8 members worldwide, including residents of Kern County and within the local communities in

9 the vicinity of Tejon Ranch. The Center has worked for many years to protect imperiled plants

10 and wildlife, open space, air and water quality, and the overall quality of life for people in the
11 south end of the San Joaquin Valley where the Project is proposed. Members of the Center

12 objected to the approval and construction of the Project and will be directly and adversely

13 affected by the Project.

14 9. Respondent KERN COUNTY a (the "County"), a political subdivision of the State

15 of California, is responsible for regulating and controlling land use in the unincorporated

16 territory of the County, including implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA.

17 The County is the "lead agency" for the purposes of Public Resources Code Section 21067,

18 with primary responsibility for conducting environmental review of the proposed actions.

19 10. Respondent KERN COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS (the "Board") is the
20 duly elected decisionmaking body of the County. As the decisionmaking body, the Board is

21 charged with the responsibilities under CEQA for conducting a proper review of the proposed
22 action's environmental impacts and granting the various approvals necessary for the Project.

23 11. Petitioner is informed and believes Real Party in Interest TEJON RANCHCORP
24 ("Tejon") is the Project applicant and developer, is incorporated in the State of California and

25 does business in the State of California, and is an applicant for approval of the Project.
26 12. Petitioner is informed and believes Real Party in Interest TEJON RANCH
27 COMPANY wholly owns and controls Tejon Ranchcorp, is incorporated in the State of

28 Delaware, and does business in California.

Printed on Recycled Paper 3 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

13. Petitioner does not know the true names and capacities, whether individual,

2 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of respondents DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, and 1 therefore

3 sues said respondents under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition to show their

4 true names and capacities when the same have been ascertained. Each of the respondents is the
agent and/or employee of Respondents, and each performed acts on which this action is based

6 within the course and scope of such Respondents' agency and/or employment.

7 14. Petitioner does not know the true names and capacities, whether individual,

8 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of real parties in interest DOES 21 through 40, inclusive, and
therefore sues said real parties in interest under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this

10 Petition to show their true names and capacities when the same have been ascertained.

11 STATEMENT OF FACTS

12 The Grapevine Project and Location

13 15. The Project is located on 8,010 acres of land at the south end of the San Joaquin

14 Valley. The area is bounded by the Tehachapi Mountains and Tejon Ranch conservation lands

15 to the south, east, and west, the Tejon Ranch Tecuya Creek Conservation Easement and Wind
16 Wolves Preserve to the west, and the Tejon Ranch Commerce Center ("TRCC") to the north.

17 The Project area is 40 miles south of employment centers in Bakersfield and 80 miles north of
18 Downtown Los Angeles.

19 16. The Project location is currently set aside as a protected Agricultural Reserve and is

20 biologically sensitive area, which is home to numerous threatened and endangered wildlife

21 species, including, but not limited to, the federally and state-protected San Joaquin kit fox,

22 blunt-nosed leopard lizard, California condor, golden eagle, bald cagle, white-tailed kite,

23 ringtail, badger, San Joaquin coachwhip, burrowing owl, Northern harrier, tricolored blackbird,

24 and loggerhead shrike, calico monkeyflower, Piute Mountains navarettia, and Tejon poppy.

25 17. The Project is a master-planned, mixed-used residential and commercial

26 development which would create a new town of 12,000 dwelling units, up to 5.1 million square

27 feet of commercial development, and over 44,000 people. The Project's residential and

28 commercial development footprint would cover 4,643 acres.

Printed on Recycled Paper 4 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

18. The Project comprises multiple components including a specific plan, a general plan
2 amendments, zoning changes, tentative tract a maps, and a development agreement.

3 Project Review and Approval

4 19. On or about April 1, 2014, Respondents issued a Notice of Preparation for a

5 previous version of the project, in which they notified public agencies and interested individuals

6 that, as a lead agency, they would be preparing a Draft EIR to analyze the project's potentially

7 significant environmental impacts.

8 20. On December 6, 2016, Respondents certified the Final EIR (the "2016 EIR") and

9 approved the previous version of the project (the "2016 Project").

10 21. On January 5, 2017, Petitioner Center for Biological Diversity along with the

11 Center for Food Safety challenged Respondents' decision to approve the 2016 Project based

12 upon a legally inadequate EIR.

13 22. On February 15, 2019, the Honorable Kenneth C. Twisselman II issued a
14 Judgment Granting Peremptory Writ of Mandate (the "Judgment"). The Judgment determined

15 that the 2016 EIR failed to review or assess the reasonably foreseeable consequences of the
16 actual internal capture rate for automobiles falling below projected levels, which had the
17 potential to cause significant adverse effects to the environment. The Judgment concluded that

18 the 2016 EIR did not comply with CEQA because it did not consider whether such reasonably

19 foresecable consequences could cause significant adverse effects on traffic, air pollution,
20 GHGs, public health, noise, and growth inducing impacts. The Judgment ordered Respondents

21 to set aside the 2016 EIR and approvals for the 2016 Project.

22 23. On March 12, 2019, Respondents set aside the 2016 EIR and approvals for the

23 2016 Project.

24 24. On April 12, 2019, Respondents issued a Notice of Preparation of Draft
25 Supplemental Recirculated Environmental Impact Report for the Project.

26 25. On December 10, 2019, Respondents approved the SREIR and the Project.
27 26. On December 13, 2019, Respondents filed a Notice of Determination for the

28 Project.

Printed on Recycled Paper 5 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

27. On January 9, 2020, Respondents filed a Motion for Order Discharging Writ of

2 Mandate.

3 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

4 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

5 28. Petitioner objected to the Project in the administrative process and fully exhausted

6 its administrative remedies. Petitioner submitted multiple letters during and after the comment
7 period raising the issues set forth herein.

8 29. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

9 unless this Court grants the requested writs of mandate and injunctive relief. In the absence of

10 such remedies, Respondent's approval of the Project would form the basis for a development

11 project that would proceed in violation of state law.
12 30. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 by filing a

13 copy of this petition with the California Attorney General. A copy of that notice is attached as

14 Exhibit A.

15 31. Petitioner has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by providing

16 the County and the Board with notice of its intention to commence the action. Copies of these
17 notices are attached as Exhibit B.

18 32. Petitioner elected to prepare the administrative record. A copy of that election is
19| attached as Exhibit C.

20 CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (VIOLATIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT)

22 33. Petitioner incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

23 a, Inadequate Analysis and Mitigation of Impacts.

24 34. CEQA requires Respondents to conduct an adequate environmental review prior to

25 making any formal decision regarding projects subject to CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, 14 Cal.

26 Code Regs. § 15004). §

27 35. CEQA imposes upon Respondents a clear, present and mandatory duty to certify
28 an EIR only if the EIR fully discloses to the public the significant environmental effects that

Printed on Recycled Paper 6 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

may occur. The SREIR for the Project lacks the necessary analysis.

2 36. Further, CEQA requires adoption of all feasible mitigation measures that will

3 reduce adverse environmental impacts. Many feasible mitigation measures were ignored in the

4 SREIR.

5 b. The SREIR Fails to Adequately Analyze and Mitigate Biological Impacts.

6 37. CEQA requires that environmental review assess a project's potential for adverse

7 impacts on biological resources, including special status species and wildlife connectivity.

8 38. The SREIR fails to disclose and analyze information necessary for decisionmakers

9 and the public to evaluate the Project's impacts on special status species and wildlife

10 connectivity, nor does it take into account new information and studies on these topics.

11 39. The SRBIR fails to adequately assess existing conditions, disclose project impacts,

12 or propose adequate mitigation for impacts to the San Joaquin kit fox, nor does it take into

13 account new information and studies on these topics.

14 40. The SREIR fails to adequately assess existing conditions, disclose project impacts,

15 or propose adequate mitigation for impacts to the blunt-nosed leopard lizard, nor does it take

16 into account new information and studies on these topics.

17 41. The SREIR fails to adequately assess existing conditions, disclose project impacts,

18 or propose adequate mitigation for impacts to mountain lions as well as connectivity for other

19 wide-ranging species, nor does it take into account new information and studies on these topics.

20 C. The SREIR Fails to Adequately Analyze and Mitigate Air Quality Impacts.

21 42. The U.S. government estimates that 10 to 12 percent of the country's total health

22 costs are attributable to air pollution. Air pollution adversely affects wildlife, plants, and

23 agricultural crops.

24 43. The adverse impacts of air pollution are felt most heavily by young children, the

25 elderly, pregnant women, people with existing heart and lung disease, and environmental

26 justice communities.

27 44. Southern California is one of the most polluted regions in the country. Much of

28 the pollution in Southern California is caused by transportation. The South Coast Air Basin,

Printed on Recycled Paper 7 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 San Joaquin Valley Air Basin, and Mojave Desert Air Basins currently fail to satisfy health-

2 based standards of the Clean Air Act.

3 45, Construction and operation of the Project will result in large air emissions arising

4 from operational and mobile sources associated with the Project. However, the SREIR fails to

5 fully analyze how the Project's emissions will affect the San Joaquin, South Coast, and Mojave

6 Desert air basins and whether it will prevent the state from meeting California's State

7 Implementation Plans.

8 46. The SREIR's air quality analysis fails to accurately disclose the Project's impacts

9 from PM10 and PM2.5 emissions for each of the development scenarios set forth in the SREIR.

10 47. The SREIR's estimates of emissions for each development scenario rely upon

11 | unsubstantiated inputs from the CalEEMod model. For instance, the SREIR's CalEEMod inputs

12 were manually changed to assume the use of Tier 4 Equipment even while the SREIR failed to

13 assess the feasibility of obtaining or using such equipment. Likewise, the SREIR's CalEEMod
14 inputs were manually changed to reflect a lower carbon dioxide intensity for emissions even

15 while the SREIR failed to justify this manual change in the model. The SREIR's CalEEMod
16 inputs were also manually changed to reflect lower daily trip rates for the analyzed

17 development scenarios.

18 48. The SREIR's CalEEMod inputs were manually changed to include energy-related
19 mitigation measures that are not actually required in the SREIR, thus underestimating the
20 Project's emissions.

21 49. The SREIR's CalEEMod inputs were manually changed to include mobile-related

22 operational mitigation measures that are not actually required by the SREIR, thus
23 underestimating the Project's emissions.

24 50. The SREIR's CalEEMod analysis and inputs were manually changed to include

25 waste-related operational mitigation measures that are not actually required by the SREIR, thus
26| underestimating the Project's emissions.

27 51. The SREIR fails to accurately disclose the Project's impacts from carbon

28 monoxide emissions for each development scenario set forth in the SREIR.

Printed on Recycled Paper 8 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

52. Air quality impacts are further underestimated because the SREIR underestimates

2 trip lengths and overestimates trip capture within the Project for each analyzed development
3 scenario.

4 53. The SREIR fails to discuss or analyze feasible mitigation measures submitted by

5 Petitioner to Respondents. As CEQA requires the adoption of all feasible mitigation measures

6 for impacts found to be significant and unavoidable, the failure of Respondents to adopt these
7 measures violates CEQA.

8 54. The SREIR fails to sure that mitigation measures including a Developer

9 Mitigation Contract are enforceable and effectively able to reduce emissions to less than

10 significant levels for each of the analyzed development scenarios.

11 d. The SREIR Fails to Adequately Analyze or Mitigate Greenhouse Gas
12 Impacts.

13 55. The SREIR fails to provide an adequate analysis of the Project's GHG impacts for
14 each of the analyzed development scenarios.

15 56. The SREIR fails to require all feasible mitigation measures to reduce the Project's
16 significant GHG impacts for all analyzed development scenarios.

17 57. The SREIR fails to require the Project be fully "zero net energy." Zero net energy
18 developments are feasible and being implemented currently in the region, most recently at
19 Newhall Ranch. A development that reduces onsite GHGs to the maximum extent practicable
20 and offsets all other emissions through local emissions projects is feasible and should have been
21 required.

22 58. The SREIR fails to require distributed or rooftop solar installations, required by
23 the California Energy Commission for all new homes as of 2020.

24 e. The SREIR Fails to Adequately Analyze or Mitigate Public Health Impacts.
25 59. The SREIR's public health impacts analysis is inadequate because it relies upon
26 inaccurate and unsupported estimates of emissions as described above.

27 60. The SREIR's public health impacts analysis is deficient under Sierra Club v.

28 County of Fresno (2018) 6 Cal.5th 502 because it does not inform the public how bare numbers

Printed on Recycled Paper 9 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 in the SREIR translate into potential adverse impacts or explain what Respondents do know and

2 why, given existing scientific constraints, they cannot translate potential health impacts further.

3 f. The SREIR Fails to Adequately Analyze or Mitigate Traffic Impacts.
61. The SREIR fails to contain an accurate analysis of the Project's traffic impacts for
each development scenario because, inter alia, the SREIR's CalEEMod analysis and inputs

6 were manually adjusted to reflect lower daily trip rates. The SREIR nonetheless fails to

7 substantiate or justify such changes to the model.

8 62. The SREIR underestimates the Project's traffic impacts for each development

9 scenario because the SREIR's CalEEMod analysis and inputs were manually changed to

10 include reductions in the amount of trips based upon mitigation measures that are not actually

11 required by the SREIR. The SREIR's traffic mitigation measures are also deferred, illusory, or

12 unenforceable.

13 g. The SREIR Fails to Adequately Analyze or Mitigate Fire Impacts.

14 63. The Project is located in an area designated by Respondents and CalFire as a

15 Moderate and Very High Fire Hazard Severity Zone, includes steep terrain, and is subject to

16 high winds.

17 64. In addition to endangering the residents and workers of the Project, the placement

18 of 44,000 people and their vehicles in a fire prone area increases the likelihood of fire in and

19 around the Project site.

20 65. The SREIR nonetheless relies on mitigation measures that do not take into account

21 new information and studies on the dangers of building new facilities and installing a

22 permanent population in a fire prone area. The SREIR's mitigation measures are inadequate to

23 account for the increased risk of human ignitions caused by the Project.

24 66. The SREIR fails to include sufficient specificity about the Project's fuel

25 modification plan and the extent to which it will have impacts on the Project area's important

26 biological resources, nor does it take into account new information and studies on this topic.

27 67. While much of California's native species are adapted to fire, the recent megafires

28 experienced in California burned hotter and further than previous fires, resulting in greater and

Printed on Recycled Paper 10 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 sometimes permanent damage to plant communities. The SREIR fails to analyze the impacts to
2 | biological resources that will occur if more frequent or severe fires impact the area, nor does it
3 take into account new information and studies on the nature on this topic.

4 h. The Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations Are Unsupported.
5 68. CEQA permits project with significant adverse environmental impacts to be
6 approved if the lead agency makes findings, supported by substantial evidence, that the
7 project's benefits will outweigh its adverse impacts and that there are not feasible mitigation
8 measures or less damaging alternatives available.

9 69. The SREIR admits the Project will have significant and unavoidable impacts on air
10 quality, biological resources, climate change, among other areas.

11 70. Respondents improperly rejected feasible mitigation to reduce the Project's many
12 adverse impacts. Thus, the findings are not supported by substantial evidence

13 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

14 In each of the respects enumerated above, Respondents have violated their duties under
15 law, abused their discretion, failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and decided the
16 | matters complained of without the support of substantial evidence. Accordingly, the
17 certification of the SREIR and the approval of the Project must be set aside.
18 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as follows:

19 1. For an alternative and peremptory writ of mandate, commanding Respondents:
20 A. To set aside and vacate their certification of the SREIR, Findings of Fact,
21 and Statement of Overriding Considerations supporting the approval of the Project; and
22 B. To set aside and vacate any approvals for the Project based upon the
23 SREIR, Findings of Fact, and Statement of Overriding Considerations supporting the Project,
24 including, but not limited to, the specific plan, zone change, general plan amendment, vesting
25 tentative parcel map, conditional use permit, and development agreement; and
26 2. For an order enjoining Respondents and Real Parties in Interest from taking any
27 action to construct any portion of the Project or to develop or alter the Project site in any way
28 that could result in a significant adverse impact on the environment unless and until a lawful

Printed on Recycled Paper 11 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 approval is obtained from Respondents after the preparation and consideration of an adequate

2 EIR and adoption of all feasible alternatives and mitigation measures;

3 3. For costs of the suit;

4 4. For reasonable attorneys' fees; and

5 5. For such other and further relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Re: Challenge under the California Environmental Quality Act to certification
of Supplemental Recirculated Environmental Impact Report for Grapevine
Specific and Community Plan

Dear Ms. Krause,

Please take notice that the Center for Biological Diversity plans to file a Petition
for Writ of Mandate challenging the County's certification of a Supplemental
Recirculated Environmental Impact Report ("SREIR") for the Grapevine Specific and
Community Plan (the "Project"). The Project will include 12,000 dwelling units, up to
5.1 million square feet of commercial land uses, and a development footprint of 4,643
acres. The Center believes the SREIR fails to satisfy the mandates of the California
Environmental Quality Act to fully disclose, analyze, and mitigate the Project's
numerous environmental impacts.

Sincerely,
molPa

Michelle Black
