Re: Notice of Intent to File CEQA and CESA Petition

To Whom it May Concern:

Pursuant to California Public Resources Code $ 21167.7 and California Code of Civil
Procedure § 388, please take notice that San Francisco Baykeeper, The Bay Institute, Natural
Resources Defense Council, Inc., Golden State Salmon Association, and Defenders of Wildlife
intend to commence an action in the Superior Court of California for the County of Alameda under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") against the Department of Water Resources ("DWR") and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("DFW"), and under the
California Endangered Species Act ("CESA") against DFW, concerning DWR's and DFW's approvals of the project known as the Long-Term Operation of the State Water Project ("Project") and DFW's Incidental Take Permit No. 2081-2019-066-00 ("ITP') for the Project. DWR certified the Final Environmental Impact Report for the Project on March 27, 2020, and filed a Notice of Determination with the Office of Planning and Research on March 30, 2020.
The petition for writ of mandate filed in this action, a copy of which is enclosed with this
letter, will allege, among other things, that DWR and DFW failed to properly follow CEQA's procedures and requirements including, but not limited to: failure to maintain a consistent and adequate Project description, failure to analyze a reasonable range of alternatives, failure to a analyze and disclose significant environmental impacts, failure to identify feasible mitigation
measures to avoid or substantially lessen the Project's significant adverse environmental impacts, failure to adequately analyze and consider the whole of the action, failure to adequately analyze and disclose the Project's cumulative impacts, failure to support the "no significance" conclusion with substantial evidence, and, as to DWR only, failure to recirculate the Final Environmental Impact Report for additional public review and comment.
The petition will also allege, among other things, that, under CESA, DFW's "no jeopardy" conclusion, as well as its conclusion that conditions in the ITP will fully mitigate impacts to CESA-listed fish species, are not supported by the evidence.

The petition will seek, among other things, a peremptory writ of mandate declaring that
DWR and DFW have violated CEQA and CESA and vacating and setting aside the Project's
approvals, including the findings that the Project satisfies CEQA's and CESA's requirements,
until the Project is brought into full compliance with CEQA and CESA.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

6 INTRODUCTION

2 1. The San Francisco Bay-Delta ("Delta") is formed by the confluence of California's

3 two longest rivers, the San Joaquin and the Sacramento. Fresh water from these rivers and their
4 tributaries mixes with the salt water from the Pacific Ocean to form an estuary. This estuary supports

5 hundreds of plant and animal species, including the four critically imperiled fish species at the center
6 of this case: Delta Smelt, Longfin Smelt, Spring-run Chinook Salmon and Winter-run Chinook

7 Salmon.

2. Over the last 31 years, Longfin Smelt, Delta Smelt, Spring-run and Winter-run
9 Chinook Salmon have been listed as threatened or endangered under the California Endangered
10| Species Act ("CESA"), Fish & Game Code § 2050 et seq. The California State Legislature has
11 declared that the "conservation, protection, and enhancement" of these and other fish species facing
12 extinction is a matter of statewide concern. Scientists and policymakers alike agree that protections
13 for threatened and endangered fish species must be strengthened to ensure their continued survival.

14 3. Since being listed under CESA, populations of Longfin Smelt, Delta Smelt, Spring-
15 run and Winter-run Chinook Salmon ("CESA-Listed Fish Species") have continued to decline toward

16 extinction.

17 4. A major driver of the CESA-Listed Fish Species' decline is the operation of the State
18 Water Project ("SWP"), a massive water delivery system in California operated by the California
19 Department of Water Resources ("DWR"). On average, the SWP exports approximately 2.5 million
20 | acre-feet of water from the Delta and upstream tributaries per year for use by water contractors,
21  including for the agricultural industry, and towns and cities.

22 5. The SWP is operated in conjunction with the federally managed Central Valley

23 Project ("CVP"), one of the largest water delivery systems in the country. The CVP is operated by
24 United States Bureau of Reclamation (*Reclamation") and delivers an average of approximately

25 seven million acre-feet of water per year to agricultural, municipal, and industrial consumers. The

26 CVP is comprised of approximately 20 dams and reservoirs spanning some 400 miles within

27 California. The operations of the SWP and CVP are coordinated pursuant to a Coordinated

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Operation Agreement, and their operations overlap at particular freshwater sources and water-

2 management facilities within the State, including the pumping facilities in the Delta.

3 6. The SWP and CVP harm the CESA-Listed Fish Species by storing, diverting, and
exporting water, which alters the timing and volume of river flows, entrains and kills these Species
5 by drawing them into pumping infrastructure, damages their habitat, and disrupts fish-migration

patterns.

7. Against a backdrop of persistent population declines and scientific evidence showing
the need to increase protections for the CESA-Listed Fish Species, DWR decided to modify its
ongoing, long-term SWP operations. In November, 2019, DWR notified the public of its proposed
10 plan to modify the SWP's long-term operations (the "Long-Term Operations Project" or "Project").
11 Instead of protecting the CESA-Listed Fish Species, the proposed changes threaten to facilitate and
12 accelerate their ongoing decline by continuing to dramatically alter the hydrologic landscape of the
13 Delta without adequate environmental safeguards.

14 8. The California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code § 21000 et seq.,
15 required DWR to thoroughly analyze the impacts of the Project on the environment in an
16 Environmental Impact Report, and to ensure that any significant adverse impacts were either avoided
17 | or mitigated.

18 9. On March 27, 2020, DWR issued its Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") and
19 Notice of Determination for the Long-Term Operations Project. The FEIR found that the Long-Term
20| Operations Project would not have significant environmental impact upon the CESA-Listed Fish
21 Species, and certified Refined Alternative 2b as the environmentally superior alternative.

22 10. The FEIR is inadequate under CEQA. Among other deficiencies, it fails to maintain a
23 consistent project description; omits crucial analyses of foresecable impacts on the CESA-Listed Fish
24 Species; fails to analyze any alternatives that would strengthen protections for the CESA-Listed Fish
25 || Species; and relies on vague, unenforceable, and, in some cases, irrelevant mitigation measures to
26 wrongly conclude that the Long-Term Operations Project will not have significant adverse impacts

27 on the CESA-Listed Fish Species.

28

2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 11. DWR prepared the FEIR and reached these conclusions despite concerns raised by
2 Petitioners San Francisco Baykeeper, The Bay Institute, Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,
3 Golden State Salmon Association, and Defenders of Wildlife, and other stakeholders.

4 12. DWR's failure to conduct adequate environmental review will lead to calamitous
5 outcomes for the CESA-Listed Fish Species. The risk of extinction for these Species will continue to

6 increase, and their populations will continue to decline, as a result of operations described in the

7 Long-Term Operations Project.

8 13. As the agency charged with managing California's fish and wildlife, the California
9 Department of Fish and Wildlife ("DFW") has primary responsibility for ensuring that the CESA-
10 Listed Fish Species do not go extinct. DFW served as a responsible agency in the Long-Term
11 Operations Project CEQA review process.

12 14. DFW's legal violations compound those that DWR made. As a responsible agency,
13 DFW was required to independently analyze the Long-Term Operations Project's environmental
14 impacts on the CESA-Listed Fish Species, and withhold its approval until it was certain that DWR
15 had complied with CEQA's requirements. Instead, DFW issued CEQA Findings that rubber-stamped
16 DWR'S conclusions in the FEIR, likely resulting in catastrophic consequences for the wildlife,
17 including the CESA-Listed Fish Species, that DFW is charged to conserve.

18 15. As the state agency charged with administering and enforcing CESA, DFW had an
19 additional obligation to ensure that "[n]o person or public agency . . . take" an endangered or
20 threatened species unless authorized by law. Fish & Game Code $ 2080. CESA provides that DFW
21 may issue an Incidental Take Permit ("ITP") to authorize the catch, capture, or killing of endangered

22 or threatened species only where specific conditions are met, including that the impacts of the take
23 are minimized and fully mitigated, and where such issuance will not jeopardize the continued
24 existence of the listed species.

25 16. DFW's issuance of the ITP violated CESA. For instance, CDFW failed to adequately
26 demonstrate that the Project will minimize and fully mitigate take of CESA-Listed Fish Species, and
27 that issuance of the permit would not jeopardize their continued existence.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

17. Accordingly, Petitioners seek a peremptory writ of mandate:

2 a. Declaring that Respondents DWR and DWR have violated CEQA in certifying

3 an inadequate and unlawful FEIR;

4 b. Ordering DWR and DFW to vacate and set aside their Long-Term Operations
uo Project approvals, including their CEQA Findings, certification of the FEIR,
and Notice of Determination, until the Project is brought into full compliance
A 0 with CEQA and CESA; and

C. Enjoining all activity in reliance on the FEIR until Respondents fully comply
with CEQA.

10 18. Petitioners also seek a peremptory writ of mandate:

11 a. Declaring that Respondent DFW has violated CESA;

12 b. Ordering DFW to set aside its Long-Term Operations Project approvals,

13 including its ITP, until the Project is brought into full compliance with CEQA

14 and CESA; and

15 C. Enjoining all activity in reliance on the ITP until Respondent DFW fully

16 complies with CESA.

2 DWR, jointly with the other Petitioners herein, relating to DWR's issuance of the DEIR, and also

3 submitted comments to DFW regarding inadequacies of DWR's application for an ITP under CESA.

4 24. Respondent CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES is a
Department of the State of California headquartered in Sacramento. DWR operates the SWP. DWR
is the lead agency for the approval of the Long-Term Operations Project under CEQA; it certified the
7 FEIR for the Project and issued a Notice of Determination approving the Project.

25. Respondent CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE is a state

9 agency headquartered in Sacramento charged with conserving, protecting, and managing California's
10 fish, wildlife, and native plant resources for their intrinsic value and their use and enjoyment by the
11 public. DFW's duties include administering and enforcing CESA, including issuing ITPs pursuant to
12 section 2081 of the Fish and Game Code. As CEQA responsible agency, DFW certified CEQA
13 Findings and filed a Notice of Determination approving the Long-Term Operations Project. DFW
14 also issued findings under CESA and approved the ITP for the Project.

15 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

16 26. This Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
17 sections 1085 and/or 1094.5, Public Resources Code section 21168 and/or 21168.5, and Government
18 Code sections 11342.2 and 11350.

19 27. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 393, 395 and 401, venue for this action
20 properly lies in the Alameda County Superior Court because a substantial part of the events or
21 omissions giving rise to the causes of action asserted herein occurred within this judicial district. In
22 addition, the Attorney General maintains an office in Alameda County. Further, the SWP's Harvey
23 O. Banks Delta Pumping Plant is located in Alameda County. The operation of this pumping plant,
24  which is used to pump and export water out of the Delta, creates many of the harmful conditions that
25  give rise to this action. These pumps entrain and kill fish, including the CESA-Listed Fish Species.
26 The pumps also reduce the total amount of water flowing out of the Delta and into San Francisco
27 Bay, part of which lies within Alameda County, which in turn alters the basic water quality

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

conditions and biological productivity of the habitat for these and other species in both the Delta and
2 San Francisco Bay. Finally, as set forth above, Petitioners maintain offices and/or have many

3 members who reside within this judicial district.

4 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

5 28. Petitioners have exhausted all administrative remedies, as required by Public

6 Resources Code section 21177, by submitting written comments to DWR on the DEIR prior to
7 project approval requesting compliance with CEQA, CESA, and other laws, including adequate
8 environmental review. All CEQA issues raised in this petition were raised in a timely manner before

9 DWR by Petitioners, other members of the public, or public agencies within the public comment
10 period.

11 29. CESA does not provide a formal opportunity for public comment on a draft ITP.
12 Nonetheless, Petitioners provided DFW with extensive comments relating to deficiencies in DWR's
13 application for the Long-Term Operations Project ITP before DFW issued the ITP. Thus, to the
14 extent applicable, Petitioners have exhausted all administrative remedies under CESA prior to filing

15 this action.

16 30. On June 5, 2020, Petitioners' counsel transmitted to DWR and DFW a Notice of Intent
17 to File CEQA Petition as required by Public Resources Code section 21167.5, providing notice of
18 Petitioners' intent to file this Petition. See Exhibit A hereto.

19 31. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of
20 Civil Procedure section 388 by serving, on June 5, 2020, a copy of this Petition on the Attorney
21 General and providing notice of the Petition. See Exhibit B hereto.

22 32. This Petition is timely filed pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167 and
23 California Code of Regulations, title 14, section 15112(c)(1) ("CEQA Guidelines"). On March 30,
24 2020, DWR filed the Notice of Determination with the Office of Planning and Research. On April 6,
25 2020, the Judicial Council of California issued Emergency Rule 9 of the California Rules of Court 9
26| ("Emergency Rule 9"), which provides that, "[n]otwithstanding any other law, the statutes of
27 limitation for civil causes of action are tolled from April 6, 2020, until 90 days after the Governor

28

9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 declares that the state of emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic is lifted." On April 29, 2020,

2 DWR, DFW, and Petitioners entered into a tolling agreement in which the parties agreed that

3 Emergency Rule 9 applies to Petitioners' causes of actions under CEQA and CESA. As of the date

4 of filing this Petition, DWR and DFW have not terminated the tolling agreement, nor has the
5 Governor lifted the state of emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

6 STATUTORY FRAMEWORK

7 I. The California Environmental Quality Act

8 33. A lead agency under CEQA must prepare an EIR to gather and disclose to public

9 agencies and the public detailed information about a proposed project's potential impacts on the
10 environment and measures to reduce or avoid significant impacts to the environment from the
11 proposed project.

12 34. The EIR must contain a clear description of a proposed project, and that description
13 must remain consistent and accurate throughout the CEQA process. A "project" under CEQA
14 includes the whole of an action that may result in either a direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect
15| physical change in the environment.

16 35. The EIR must consider a reasonable range of alternatives to the proposed project,
17 including a no action alternative.

18 36. In preparing the EIR, the lead agency must consider whether a proposed project's
19 adverse impacts are significant, and the agency must make specific written findings for each
20 significant impact identified in an EIR. Specifically, the agency must make one of three findings:

21 a. That changes or alterations have been required or incorporated in the project

22 that avoid or substantially lessen the project's significant environmental

23 impact(s);

24 b. That such changes or alterations are within the responsibility and jurisdiction

25 of another public agency, and that such changes have been adopted or can and

26 should be adopted by that agency; or

27

28

10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

C. Specific economic, legal, social, technological, or other considerations make

2 the mitigation measures or project alternatives identified in the EIR infeasible.

37. These findings must be supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record.

4 38. Regulations implementing CEQA mandate that the lead agency find that an impact is

5 significant if certain conditions are met, including if it would "cause a fish or wildlife population to

6 drop below self-sustaining levels" or if it would "substantially reduce the number or restrict the range
7 of an endangered, rare, or threatened species."

8 39. An EIR must describe feasible measures that could minimize the adverse impacts of a
9 project on the environment to a less than significant level.
10 40. Further, the EIR must consider the project's cumulative impacts.

11 41. Besides lead agencies, CEQA requires responsible agencies to review proposed
12 projects and issue findings. Responsible agencies include any public agency other than the lead
13 agency that has discretionary approval authority over the project.

14 42. Every responsible agency must independently consider the information in the EIR and
15 | make its own findings regarding whether and how to approve the project. The responsible agency's
16 findings must be supported by substantial evidence in the record.

17 43. A lead or responsible agency's failure to proceed in accordance with CEQA's
18 mandates or to support its CEQA findings with substantial evidence is a reversible abuse of

19 discretion.

20 II. The California Endangered Species Act

21 44. CESA prohibits the "take" of endangered or threatened species unless otherwise
22 authorized by law. The Fish and Game Code defines "take" to mean to "hunt, pursue, catch, capture,

23 or kill, or to attempt to hunt, pursue, catch, capture, or kill" any species listed under CESA as
24 threatened or endangered.

25 45. CESA's take prohibition applies to state agencies, including DWR.

26 46. CESA authorizes DFW to permit the incidental take of species listed as threatened or
27 endangered under CESA by issuing an ITP where certain conditions are met, including:

28

11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

a. The impacts of the take must be minimized and fully mitigated; and

b. Issuance of the ITP must and does not jeopardize the continued existence of
the species. DFW must make this jeopardy determination based on the best
scientific and other information that is reasonably available, including a
4n consideration of the species' capability to survive and reproduce, and any
adverse impacts of the taking on those abilities in light of known population
trends; known threats to the species; and reasonably foreseeable impacts on the
species from other related projects and activities.

9 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

10 I. The Continued Decline of Endangered and Threatened Fish Species in the San
11 Francisco Bay-Delta

12 47. The populations of the CESA-Listed Fish Species in the San Francisco Bay-Delta
13 have declined precipitously over the past decades. Due to insufficient flows, entrainment, and other
14| impacts attributable to the SWP and CVP, Longfin Smelt abundance has declined by 99.9 percent
15 since 1967, and Delta Smelt abundance has declined to the point where they are nearly undetectable
16 in sampling programs in which they were once common. Historically, annual returns of Winter-run

17 Chinook Salmon and Spring-run Chinook Salmon numbered in the tens of thousands and hundreds of
18 thousands, respectively, but recent returns of both runs have numbered in the hundreds or low

19 thousands.

20 48. State and federal agencies have concluded that it is necessary to increase protections
21 for the CESA-Listed Fish Species, including increasing Delta outflows, to halt the decline of the
22 native fish species, including the CESA-Listed Fish Species, in the Delta and its watershed.

23 49. In 2010, DFW reported to the state legislature that changes in Delta flows resulting
24 from upstream diversions and operations of the State and federal water projects upstream of and in
25| the Delta had modified the Delta ecosystem so severely that current Delta water flows for
26 environmental resources are not adequate to maintain, recover, or restore the functions and processes

27 that support native Delta fish, including the CESA-Listed Fish Species.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

50. In 2017, the California State Water Resources Control Board affirmed DFW's

2 conclusions, finding in its Scientific Basis Report in Support of New and Modified Requirements for
3 Inflows from the Sacramento River and its Tributaries and Eastside Tributaries to the Delta, Delta

4 Outflows, Cold Water Habitat, and Interior Delta Flows that significant scientific information
5  indicates that restoration of more natural flow function throughout the watershed from natal streams
6 to the nearshore ocean is needed now to reverse the native fish species' declines.

7 51. In 2018, pursuant to its scientific findings that current Delta outflow levels are
8 inadequate to protect the Bay-Delta ecosystem, the State Water Resources Control Board released its
9 Framework for the Sacramento/Delta Update to the Bay-Delta Plan, which proposed significantly
10 increasing Delta outflows and strengthening other environmental protections.

11 52. Reclamation, which operates the CVP, is authorized to take fish species listed under
12 the federal Endangered Species Act ("ESA") pursuant to federal Biological Opinions issued by the
13 National Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ("2008 and 2009 Biological
14 Opinions"). Reclamation does not have an ITP authorizing the take of fish species listed under
15 CESA by the CVP.

16 53. In 2016, due in significant part to the continued decline of ESA-listed fish populations

17 in the Delta, including most of the CESA-Listed Fish Species, Reclamation asked the National
18 Marine Fisheries Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to reinitiate consultation regarding
19 the 2008 and 2009 Biological Opinions. In August, 2016, all three agencies agreed to reinitiate
20 consultation, in part due to new science indicating the need to strengthen protections under the 2008

21 and 2009 Biological Opinions.

22 54. That same month, the Secretary of the United States Department of the Interior issued
23 a memorandum stating that the protections in the 2008 and 2009 Biological Opinions should be
24 increased to avoid causing the extinction of Delta Smelt and Winter-run Chinook Salmon, and that
25 increased protections for these endangered and threatened species would likely require the CVP and
26 SWP to reduce water diversions from the Delta.

1 55. Yet, in 2019, Reclamation issued a biological assessment outlining a proposed water-
2 operations plan for the CVP that would substantially increase diversions from the Sacramento and

3 San Joaquin River watersheds, increase exports of water from the Delta to the Central Valley and
4 southern California, and weaken or eliminate safeguards for endangered species that were included in

5 the 2008 and 2009 Biological Opinions.

6 56. On July 1, 2019, biologists at the National Marine Fisheries Service finalized a
7 Biological Opinion that concluded that Reclamation's proposed plan was likely to jeopardize several
8 listed species, including Winter-run Chinook Salmon and Spring-run Chinook Salmon. Nonetheless,

9 the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Fish and Wildlife Service issued new Biological
10 Opinions on October 1, 2019 (*2019 Biological Opinions"), concluding that Reclamation's proposed
11 plan was not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of Winter-run Chinook Salmon, Spring-run
12 Chinook Salmon, or Delta Smelt. This conclusion was an about-face from both the 2008 and 2009
13 Biological Opinions and the National Marine Fisheries Service's July 1,2019, Biological Opinion.

14 57. On February 20, 2020, the California Natural Resources Agency, the California
15 Environmental Protection Agency, and the California Attorney General filed suit in federal court
16 challenging the federal ESA process. The lawsuit contends that Reclamation's new CVP operations

17 and the 2019 Biological Opinions are unlawful under the ESA, the Administrative Procedure Act,
18 and the National Environmental Policy Act. The State issued a press release announcing that the
19 2019 Biological Opinions would cause imminent and irreparable harm to protected species. On April
20 21, 2020, the State of California amended its complaint to contend that Reclamation's operations

21 were also unlawful under CESA. The State sought a preliminary injunction, asserting that operations
22 of the CVP were causing irreparable harm to Delta Smelt and Longfin Smelt, two of the species listed
23 under CESA and permitted to be taken pursuant to DFW's ITP for the Long-Term Operations
24 Project. On May 12, 2020, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California
25 granted the State's motion for a preliminary injunction on federal-law grounds.

IT. The Joint Operations of the SWP and CVP

2 58. The SWP is a major water-storage and -diversion project operated by DWR. It stores
water upstream of, and diverts water from, the Delta through its network of dams, reservoirs, canals,

4 and pumping facilities for agricultural and municipal uses. Two of the SWP's primary components

5 are the Banks Pumping Plant in the south Delta, which pumps water from Clifton Court Forebay into

6 the California Aqueduct, and Oroville Dam on the Feather River.

59. The CVP, meanwhile, is a federal water-storage and -diversion project operated by

8 Reclamation. The CVP is comprised of approximately 20 dams and reservoirs, including some of the
storage and diversion facilities in California, such as Shasta and Keswick Dams on the largest water
10 Sacramento River and the Trinity Dam on the Trinity River. The CVP's C.W. Bill Jones Pumping

11 Plant is in the south Delta, along with the SWP's Banks Pumping Plant.

12 60. The operations of the SWP and CVP are closely coordinated. For example, the SWP
13 and CVP divert water together pursuant to the Agreement between the United States of America and
14 the State of California for Coordinated Operation of the Central Valley Project and State Water
15| Project ("Coordinated Operation Agreement"), which was most recently amended in 2018 with the
16  execution of an Addendum. As amended, the Coordinated Operation Agreement specifies how the
17 CVP and SWP will share responsibility for meeting water-quality standards in the Delta and specifies
18 how the CVP and SWP will share export capacity in the Delta when pumping is limited. In addition,
19 the Coordinated Operation Agreement as amended specifies how the SWP and CVP will meet
20 |l demand for water in the Sacramento Valley, which includes requirements for the CVP to deliver
21 water to certain settlement contractors of the SWP. As a result, the CVP and SWP coordinate the
22 operation of upstream reservoirs, including the CVP's Shasta Dam and Folsom Dam, and the SWP's
23 Lake Oroville, in order to ensure that the coordinated operations release adequate water from
24 upstream reservoirs to meet water-quality standards in the Delta and water diversions in the

25 Sacramento Valley.

26 61. The SWP and CVP share some facilities and water. Both the SWP and CVP use the

27 San Luis Reservoir and the San Luis Complex, a section of the California Aqueduct. In addition, a

28

15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 pipeline, known as the Delta-Mendota Canal/California Aqueduct Intertie, connects the Delta-
2 Mendota Canal, a CVP facility, and the California Aqueduct, a SWP facility, allowing water to be
3 pumped between CVP and SWP operations as needed. At times, each project relies on the other to

4 deliver its water. For example, in some months, when the CVP Jones Pumping Plant diversion is

5 pumping at maximum capacity, the SWP exports CVP water through its own Banks Pumping Plant.

6 The Intertie allows the SWP to provide as much as 35,000 acre-feet of water annually to the CVP.

7 III. The SWP, Alone and in Conjunction with the CVP, Causes Significant Harm to
8 CESA-listed Fish Species.

62. The coordinated operations of the SWP and CVP likely jeopardize the continued
10 existence of the critically imperiled CESA-Listed Fish Species, including by damaging their habitats

11 in rivers downstream of major SWP and CVP dams and altering the Delta's hydrologic landscape.

12 63. The SWP and CVP operate a system of dams that block certain CESA-Listed Fish
13 Species from accessing cool water habitat upstream and contribute to lethal warming of downstream

14 habitat.

15 64. The coordinated operations of the SWP and CVP alter river flow above, into, and
16 through the Delta by impounding water in upstream reservoirs like Shasta and Oroville Dams
17 (thereby altering the quality, quantity, and timing of downstream flows) and by reducing stream
18 flows via diversions. San Joaquin River flows are often entirely drawn into the SWP and CVP export
19 pumps, meaning that almost no water from the San Joaquin River and its tributaries reaches the San
20 Francisco Bay.

21 65. In addition, the coordinated operations of the SWP and CVP reduce Delta outflow--
22 water that would normally flow through the Delta into San Francisco Bay- as a result of upstream
23 impoundments and diversions as well as by drawing this water into massive pumping machinery in
24 || the Delta. Substantial peer-reviewed science and agency research has concluded that the volume of

25 Delta outflows is positively correlated with the survival and abundance of several of the CESA-
26 Listed Fish Species. In short, increased flows improve the likelihood that these fish will survive and
27 recover, while decreased flows increase the likelihood of their extinction.

28

16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 66. These massive pumping operations reverse the natural flow in the Old and Middle
2 Rivers, which are distributary channels of the San Joaquin River in the Delta, causing them to flow

3 uphill towards the pumps to the south- a "reverse" or "negative" flowinstead of towards the ocean

4 to the west.

5 67. By drastically altering the Delta's natural flow patterns, the SWP and CVP interfere

6 with the rearing and migration of the CESA-Listed Fish Species, causing indirect mortality.
7 Furthermore, the alteration of Delta flow patterns draws these fish into the canals leading to the

8 export pump machinery ("entrainment"), which results in direct mortality.

9 68. Evidence shows that fish entrainment increases dramatically as the magnitude of
10 reverse flows in Old and Middle River increases. Although some fish are "salvaged" from pump
11 facilities and later trucked and released, that number is only a small portion of the total number of
12  entrained fish; the vast majority of entrained fish die.

13 69. As a result of coordinated operations of the SWP and CVP, the CESA-Listed Fish

14 Species, once abundant in the Bay-Delta, are now approaching extinction.

15 A. Longfin Smelt

16 70. Longfin Smelt were listed as threatened under CESA in 2009.

17 71. The Bay-Delta supports the largest remaining Longfin Smelt population in California.
18 Longfin Smelt were once abundant in the Bay-Delta, even contributing to a commercial fishery. Due

19 to insufficient Delta outflow to the Bay, direct and indirect mortality of fish entrained by the CVP
20 and SWP water pumps, and other stressors, Longfin Smelt abundance has declined by more than 99.9

21 percent since DFW began its Fall Midwater Trawl survey in 1967.

22 72. The volume of fresh water flowing from Central Valley rivers through the Delta in the
23 winter and spring is, by far, the most important factor in determining juvenile Longfin Smelt

24 abundance. Longfin Smelt population levels increase as Delta outflows increase, and population

25 levels decrease as Delta outflows decrease.

26

27

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 B. Delta Smelt

2 73. The Delta is home to the only Delta Smelt population on Earth. Delta Smelt were
3 listed as threatened under the ESA and CESA in 1993; DFW elevated their status to endangered

4 under CESA in 2009.

5 74. Delta Smelt spend most of their life in the Delta's low-salinity zone where saline and

6 fresh waters mix, although they migrate upstream into freshwater to spawn. Because Delta Smelt

7 rely on freshwater and low-salinity habitats for spawning and rearing, they are particularly vulnerable
8  to the SWP and CVP's water storage, diversion, and export operations, which affect Delta Smelt
9 habitat quantity and quality. In particular, as fresh water is stored, diverted, or exported, Delta Smelt
10  habitat shifts upstream from the Suisun Bay to less hospitable river channels in the Delta. The
11 distribution of Delta Smelt tracks the low-salinity zone; as Delta outflow declines Delta Smelt move
12 into areas where they are unlikely to survive.

13 75. The scientific community broadly agrees that CVP and SWP water exports and the
14 corresponding reductions in Delta outflows significantly and adversely affect Delta Smelt abundance

15 and survival from one life stage to the next. The California Natural Resources Agency's 2016 Delta

16 Smelt Resiliency Strategy called for increased summer Delta outflows to help protect and restore the
17 Delta Smelt population.

18 76. In 2018 and 2019, the Fall Midwater Trawl index, which reflects Delta Smelt

19 abundance, registered zero for the first time in history, meaning that the population has declined to
20 the extent that the species is undetectable by DFW's Fall Midwater Trawl aquatic sampling program.

21 C. Winter-run Chinook Salmon

22 77. Winter-run Chinook Salmon were listed as threatened under the federal ESA in 1989;
23 their status was elevated to endangered in 1994. Winter-run Chinook Salmon have been listed as

24 endangered under CESA since 1989.

25 78. Until the 1960s, Winter-run Chinook Salmon populations approached 120,000 fish. In
26 recent years, only several hundred to a few thousand Winter-run Chinook Salmon returned to spawn

27 in the Upper Sacramento River.

28

18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

79. Adult Winter-run Chinook Salmon typically migrate upstream from the ocean through
2 the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta from November through July, spawning in late spring and through

3 the summer in the upper Sacramento River.

4 80. Winter-run Chinook Salmon used to spawn in perennial cold-water sources that these
5 fish need to reproduce successfully, but Reclamation's Shasta and Keswick dams have blocked their
6 historic spawning grounds. As a result, Winter-run Chinook Salmon have been reduced to single,
7  small population that relies exclusively on a small stretch of the a upper Sacramento River below
8 Keswick Dam to spawn.

9 81. The operations of the CVP's Shasta and Keswick dams pursuant to the Coordinated
10 Operation Agreement pose a particular threat to the Winter-run Chinook Salmon population. When
11 dam operators maintain an inadequate supply of cold water, warm water released from the dams
12 flows through Chinook Salmon nests located downstream, causing their eggs to die.

13 82. In 2014 and 2015, endangered Winter-run Chinook salmon were nearly completely
14 wiped out by lethal water temperatures below Shasta and Keswick Dams, with estimated
15 temperature-dependent mortality of 77 percent in 2014 and 85 percent in 2015.

16 83. SWP operations harm Chinook Salmon by, for example, reducing Delta inflows and
17 outflows and contributing to reverse flows in the Old and Middle Rivers. These changes disrupt
18 salmon migration patterns and reduce the survival of juvenile salmon migrating down the Sacramento
19 River, through the Delta, and into San Francisco Bay.
20 D. Spring-run Chinook Salmon

21 84. Spring-run Chinook Salmon were listed as threatened under both the ESA and CESA
22 in 1999.

23 85. Historically, the Central Valley supported as many as 600,000 Spring-run Chinook
24 Salmon each year between the late 1880s and 1940s. In recent years, spawning Spring-run Chinook
25 Salmon returns have numbered between several hundred to just over 20,000 fish.

26 86. Adult Spring-run Chinook Salmon typically begin migrating into fresh water from
27 March through September. They spawn in the Sacramento River and its tributaries, including the

28

19
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Feather River, from August through October.

2 87. Similarly to Winter-run Chinook Salmon, operations of the CVP's Shasta and

3 Keswick dams and the SWP's Oroville Dam harm Spring-run Chinook Salmon by disrupting Spring-

4 Run Chinook Salmon migration patterns and providing too little cool water from dams, in turn
5 causing significant temperature-related mortality to Spring-run Chinook Salmon eggs.

6 88. The State Water Resources Control Board concluded that high water temperatures

7 below these dams caused significant, and potentially complete, mortality of Spring-run Chinook

8 Salmon eggs in the Sacramento River during 2014.

9 IV. DWR's Process for Modifying the SWP's Long-Term Operations

10 A. The Draft Environmental Impact Report

11 89. DWR issued a Notice of Preparation under CEQA for the Long-Term Operations
12 Project on April 19, 2019. DWR issued the DEIR on November 21, 2019, and formally accepted
13  public comments on the DEIR until January 6, 2020.

14 90. The Notice of Preparation asserted that the DEIR would analyze the potential impacts
15 associated with long-term SWP facility operations, as well as the addendum to the Coordinated
16 Operation Agreement executed on December 12, 2018. The Notice of Preparation stated that "[t]he
17 | CEQA project encompasses SWP water diversion, storage, and conveyance facilities and SWP
18 service areas throughout the state, as shown in Figure 1." SWP facilities shown on "Figure 1"
19 include the SWP's Oroville Dam complex on the Feather River.

20 91. The DEIR considered five alternatives: the No Project Alternative, Alternative 2a,

21 Alternative 2b, Alternative 3, and Alternative 4. None of these alternatives proposed reducing
22 exports and increasing Delta inflows and outflows, which would have strengthened protections for
23 the CESA-Listed Fish Species.

24 92. Although the DEIR recognized that Oroville Reservoir is one of the principal SWP

25 facilities, the DEIR generally only considered the environmental effects of SWP operations in the
26 Delta, and the DEIR generally excluded consideration of environmental impacts from the coordinated

27 operations of the CVP and SWP upstream of the Delta.

28

20
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

93. DWR identified Alternative 2b as its preferred alternative in the DEIR. That

2 alternative would increase overall water exports from the SWP and decrease overall flows into and

3 through the Delta in some years.

4 94. The DEIR asserted that none of the alternatives, including Alternative 2b, would cause
5 significant environmental impacts to any of the CESA-Listed Fish Species.

95. DWR failed to adequately analyze the environmental impacts that would result from
the coordinated operations of the CVP and SWP under Alternative 2b, despite the DEIR repeatedly
describing the Long-Term Operations Project as the coordinated operations of the SWP and CVP.

96. Petitioners and other stakeholders submitted detailed, similar comments on the DEIR
10 expressing serious concern about, among other things, the DEIR's failure to consider an alternative
11 that would increase protections for the CESA-Listed Fish Species, failure to provide a consistent
12 project description, failure to analyze Alternative 2b's cumulative impacts, failure to adequately
13 analyze the impacts from the coordinated operations of the CVP and SWP, failure to consider
14 impacts from upstream operations of the SWP and/or CVP, and failure to use credible scientific
15 analysis of impacts to the CESA-Listed Fish Species and other fish species.

16 97. Petitioners requested that DWR revise the DEIR to address and correct these and other
17 deficiencies and circulate it for public review.

18 B. The Final Environmental Impact Report

19 98. DWR did not recirculate a revised DEIR or address the numerous legal deficiencies
20 identified by Petitioners and other parties during the comment period. Instead, DWR revised
21 Alternative 2b and created a new alternative called "Refined Alternative 2b." Refined Alternative 2b
22 combined selected elements from the alternatives analyzed in the DEIR to create a new project

23  alternative not considered in the DEIR.

24 99. DWR certified Refined Alternative 2b as the environmentally superior alternative

25 without allowing for public review or comment.

26 100. Refined Alternative 2b authorized Delta inflow, Delta outflow, and Old and Middle
27 River flow levels that are likely to continue to imperil the CESA-Listed Fish Species. Further,

28

21
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 ll Refined Alternative 2b allowed for water export operations that would significantly harm the CESA-
2 Listed Fish Species.

3 101. On March 27, 2020, DWR adopted Refined Alternative 26 as its preferred alternative
4 for the Long-Term Operations Project and certified its FEIR. On March 30, 2020, DWR filed a
5 Notice of Determination for the Long-Term Operations Project with the State Clearinghouse.

6 102. Because DWR chose not to correct the deficiencies in the DEIR raised by Petitioners
and others during the public comment period before certifying the FEIR, the FEIR does not

8 adequately analyze and account for the significant adverse impacts of the Long-Term Operations
9 Project on the CESA-Listed Fish Species and other fish species.

10 103. Despite concerns raised by Petitioners and other parties that Project operations

11 upstream of the Delta do and will adversely alter the quality, quantity, and timing of Delta flows
12 | downstream, the FEIR does not analyze impacts from the Long-Term Operations Project at Lake

13 Oroville.

14 104. The FEIR does not analyze the environmental impacts of the coordinated operations of
15 | the SWP and CVP upstream of the Delta.

16 105. The FEIR does not account for the fact that DWR and Reclamation have concluded

is 17 that it is reasonably foreseeable that they will request, and that the State Water Resources Control
18 Board will likely grant, waivers of protective measures for fish species, including the CESA-Listed
19  Fish Species, during droughts in the near term.

20 106. The FEIR does not analyze projected changes in climate over the long term.

21 107. The FEIR does not model the Old and Middle River reverse flows that are included in

22 the Project description and that the Project authorizes, and as a result the analysis in the FEIR
23 understates the Project's likely harm to the CESA-Listed Fish Species.

24 108. Although the Notice of Preparation asserted that the EIR would analyze the effects of
25 implementation of the 2018 Addendum to the Coordinated Operation Agreement, instead the FEIR
26 included the effects of implementation of the 2018 Addendum to the Coordinated Operation
27 Agreement in the environmental baseline used in the FEIR. As a result, the FEIR fails to analyze the

28

22
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

effects from implementing the 2018 Addendum to the Coordinated Operation Agreement, including
2  increased temperature in the Feather River resulting in reduced survival of Chinook Salmon eggs and
3 Ijuveniles.

4 109. The FEIR uses faulty statistical analysis to analyze changes to Longfin Smelt
5 abundance as a result of the Long-Term Operations Project, thereby underestimating negative
6 impacts on Longfin Smelt. For example, DWR finds the reductions in Delta outflow caused by the
7 Project will lead to a four- to 11-percent reduction in the median abundance of Longfin Smelt. By

8 dividing the difference in median values by an inappropriate variability metric, DWR. used a
9 statistically invalid approach to reduce its projected declines in Longfin Smelt abundance to zero to
10 two percent.

11 110. Despite the FEIR's flawed modeling of effects on the Longfin Smelt population, those
12 estimated declines in abundance do not account for all of the Project's impacts to this species,
13 including anticipated increases in entrainment of larval and juvenile Longfin Smelt.

14 111. Furthermore, the FEIR does not estimate entrainment of larval Longfin Smelt during
15 April and May at all, despite the fact that (a) larvae Longfin Smelt are abundant in April and May and
16 are present in the Delta many months of the year, particularly from January through June, and (b)
17 water exports by the CVP and SWP are expected to increase in these months. This omission allowed

18 DWR to inaccurately conclude that the Project would not cause a significant increase in Longfin

19 Smelt larvae entrainment.

20 112. The FEIR assumes Reclamation's cooperation to ensure that operations of the SWP
21  and CVP maintain the Old and Middle River flow levels required by the Project. The FEIR's
22 operational modeling and impact analyses unreasonably assume that Reclamation meets 100 percent
23 | of its proportional share of Old and Middle River requirements. At the same time, DWR disclaims
24 responsibility for ensuring that Reclamation's proportional share of these requirements is actually
25 met.

26 113. The FEIR repeatedly fails to define measures that are intended to prevent or mitigate
27 impacts to fish species, including the CESA-Listed Fish Species, leaving them to DWR's discretion

28

23
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

. 1 | to implement on an as-needed, real-time basis.

2 114. For example, DWR relies on a "collaborative real-time risk assessment decision-
3 making process" to minimize impacts on state and federally listed fish species, but the FEIR does not
4 specify what circumstances would warrant a "risk assessment," which agency has the authority to call

5 for an assessment, or which factors will be considered in the assessment.

6 115. Similarly, the FEIR touts an "adaptive management" plan to allow DWR to provide

7 "spring maintenance flows to better understand how the management of water and habitat across
8 various hydrologic conditions would benefit listed fish species." However, this plan does not require

9 DWR to provide spring maintenance flows to benefit fish species in a given year.

10 116. The FEIR erroneously concludes that neither the Long-Term Operations Project nor
11 any of the other alternatives will cause significant impacts to the CESA-Listed Fish Species or other
12 fish species.

13 V. DFW's CEQA Process and Approval of the Long-Term Operations Project

14 117. As a responsible agency under CEQA for the Long-Term Operations Project, DFW
15 submitted comments to DWR in response to the Notice of Preparation issued in May, 2019, and
16| submitted comments in response to the DEIR issued in November, 2019.

17 118. Once DWR published the FEIR, CEQA required DFW, as a responsible agency for the
18 Long-Term Operations Project, to independently consider the FEIR and issue its own findings under
19 CEQA.

20 119. On March 31, 2020, DFW adopted DWR's Findings that the Long-Term Operations

21 Project would not have a significant impact on the environment and filed a Notice of Determination
22 with the State Clearinghouse approving the Project.

23 VI. DFW's CESA Process and Issuance of the ITP

24 120. On December 13, 2019, while the comment period for the FEIR remained open, DWR
25 applied to DFW for an ITP for the Long-Term Operations Project. This permit would allow DWR to
26 incidentally "take," or catch, capture, or kill, the CESA-Listed Fish Species, all of which are listed as
27 threatened or endangered under CESA.

28

24
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

121. To comply with CESA, DFW needed to make certain findings, including that:

2 a. Allowing DWR to catch, capture, or kill the CESA-Listed Fish Species

3 through its implementation of the Long-Term Operations Project would not

4 jeopardize the continued existence of those Species; and

5 b. All adverse impacts from the authorized taking would be minimized and fully

6 mitigated.

7 122. On March 31, 2020, DFW issued DWR ITP 2081-2019-066-00 in connection with the
8 Long-Term Operations Project, authorizing the incidental take of the CESA-Listed Fish Species for

9 ten years.

10 123. Also on March 31, 2020, and in reliance on the FEIR and the ITP, DFW adopted
11 Findings under CESA, including findings that all authorized impacts associated with issuance of the
12 ITP to DWR were minimized and fully mitigated and that issuance of the ITP would not jeopardize
13 the continued existence of any CESA-Listed Fish Species.

14 124. Contrary to DFW's CESA Findings, the ITP allows DWR to maintain or decrease
15 Delta inflow to levels that do not protect, and will harm, the CESA-Listed Fish Species. For
16 example, the ITP allows flows in the Sacramento River and tributaries that will reduce survival of
17 juvenile Winter-run Chinook Salmon and Spring-run Chinook Salmon migrating downstream.

18 125. The ITP does not require DWR to ensure Delta outflows sufficient to fully mitigate
19 impacts to certain CESA-Listed Fish Species and avoid jeopardizing these Species. For example, the
20 levels of Delta outflow anticipated under the Project place Longfin Smelt and Delta Smelt at great
21 risk of extinction.

22 126. The ITP allows DWR to operate to reverse flows in Old and Middle River that are
23 more negative than levels that were previously authorized, causing additional harm to CESA-Listed
24 Fish Species. For instance, allowing these Old and Middle River reverse flows is likely to is increase
25 | entrainment and mortality of Longfin Smelt, Delta Smelt, Spring-run Chinook Salmon, and Winter-
26 run Chinook Salmon, and to reduce the survival of juvenile Winter-run Chinook Salmon and Spring-
27 run Chinook salmon migrating through the Delta.

28

25
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

127. The ITP fails to sufficiently limit water exports, which will likely worsen entrainment-

2 related impacts for Delta Smelt, Longfin Smelt, Winter-run Chinook Salmon, and Spring-run

3| Chinook Salmon.

4 128. For instance, the ITP allows the Project to increase Delta exports during April and
5 May and allow DWR to operate to reverse Old and Middle River flows greater than any that have

6 previously been deemed protective of the CESA-Listed Fish Species. These exports and reverse flow
7 will increase the proportion of the Delta Smelt and Longfin Smelt populations that are entrained each

8 year during the larval and juvenile life stages. The FEIR estimates, for example, that salvage of
9  Longfin Smelt juveniles and sub-adults will increase by 62 percent, 105 percent, and 195 percent in
10  below-normal, above-normal, and wet years, respectively.

11 129. The Project as authorized by the ITP also will entrain more juvenile Spring-run
12 Chinook Salmon and Winter-run Chinook Salmon. For example, the FEIR estimates that Juvenile
13 Spring-run Chinook Salmon loss will increase by 19 percent and 56 percent in above-normal and wet
14 years, respectively.

15 130. The ITP fails to ensure that impacts to the CESA-Listed Fish Species are minimized
16 | and fully mitigated. For instance, the ITP's Conditions of Approval that purportedly restrict water

17 exports and increase Delta outflow are too weak and allow too much discretion to fully mitigate the
18  impacts from the increased exports that the ITP authorizes. For example, the "collaborative real-time

19 risk assessment" decision-making processes do not describe how the assessments will inform real-
20 time decision-making, or how that real-time decision-making process will actually avoid or lessen the
21 Project's impacts on the CESA-Listed Fish Species.

22 131. In some places, the ITP allows for replacing required conditions of approval with

23 undefined voluntary agreements.

24 132. Further, as in the FEIR, the ITP assumes Reclamation's cooperation to meet Old and
25 Middle River flow requirements, but acknowledges that DWR is responsible only for ensuring its

26

27

28

26
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 proportional share of these requirements. Consequently, the ITP does not ensure that the Conditions
2 of Approval related to Old and Middle River flow requirements will be successfully implemented.

133. The ITP relies on preexisting mitigation obligations that have not been implemented,
4| including the completion of 8,800 acres of habitat restoration required by prior permits. The ITP

5 requires an additional 396.3 acres of new habitat restoration as a mitigation measure for impacts to
6 Longfin Smelt. However, the evidence does not demonstrate that such habitat restoration will
7 mitigate impacts to Longfin Smelt, and the method used to calculate the amount of habitat restoration
8 required is not supported by the best available science.

134. DFW failed to comply with its duties under CESA because it fails to explain how the
10 ITP's mitigation measures will fully mitigate the Project's significant adverse impacts on the CESA-
11 Listed Fish Species.

12 135. DFW fails to comply with its duties under CESA because it fails to explain how the
13 Project will not jeopardize the continued existence of the CESA-Listed Fish Species in light of
14 known population trends and other reasonably foreseeable projects, which includes the operations of
15 the CVP that the State has already found are not scientifically adequate and fall short of protecting
16 the CESA-Listed Fish Species and the State's interests.

17 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Violations of CEQA Against DWR and DFW)

19 136. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference each and every allegation set forth
20 above.

21 137. DWR and DFW failed to comply with law and prejudicially abused their discretion in
22 certifying the FEIR and approving the Project in violation of CEQA, including but not limited to the
23 following violations:

24 I. Failure to Maintain a Consistent and Accurate Project Description

25 138. CEQA requires agencies to maintain a consistent and accurate project description
26 throughout the CEQA process.

27

28

27
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

139. The FEIR fails to provide a stable project description for the Long-Term Operations
2 Project. For example, the FEIR inconsistently describes whether Reclamation's operations of the
3 CVP are part of the Project. The FEIR simultaneously assumes that DWR and Reclamation will

4 jointly achieve Old and Middle River flow requirements and disclaims responsibility for ensuring that
5 Reclamation's "proportional share" of these requirements are met.

6 140. The FEIR fails to maintain a consistent and accurate project description by authorizing
7 DWR to operate to the following Old and Middle River reverse-flow scenarios, then omitting
8 modeling and analysis of these same flow scenarios:
O a. Old and Middle River flow levels of negative ("-") 6,250 cfs;
10 b. Old and Middle River flow levels of -6,000 cfs lasting for longer than 7 days;

11 C. Old and Middle River flow levels of -6,000 cfs in a wet or critically dry water

12 year type;

13 d Old and Middle River flow levels of -6,000 cfs occurring more frequently than

14 once per month in January or February of an above-normal or below-normal
15 water-year type, or more frequently than once in either January or February in

16 a dry year; and

17 e. Monthly average Old and Middle River flow levels more negative than -3,500

18 cfs in March or April, more negative than -4,061 cfs in May, or more negative

19 than -5,000 cfs in June.

20 141. As a result of its inconsistent project description, the FEIR denies the public and
21 decision-makers an accurate assessment of the Project's environmental impacts.

22 II. Failure to Consider and Analyze a Reasonable Range of Alternatives

23 142. The FEIR fails to consider and analyze a reasonable range of alternatives. For
24 example, the FEIR fails to analyze an alternative that would increase protections for the CESA-Listed
25 Fish Species, despite scientific consensus that increased protections, including increased Delta
26| inflow, increased Delta outflow, and reduced export-pumping in the Delta at certain times of year, are
27  necessary to ensure the continued viability of these Species.

28

28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

143. The FEIR violates CEQA's mandate to describe a reasonable range of project
2  alternatives that could feasibly attain most of the Project's basic objectives while avoiding or
3 substantially lessening any significant impacts.

4 III. Failure to Adequately Analyze and Disclose Significant Environmental Impacts

5 144. CEQA requires an EIR to contain sufficient information, analysis, and disclosure to
6 inform the public and the decisionmakers of a project's direct and indirect impacts on the

7 environment.

8 145. The FEIR for the Long-Term Operations Project fails as an informational document

9 for the following reasons, among others:

10 a. The FEIR's climate-change analysis is inadequate because it considers only

11 projected climate changes centered around the year 2035, thereby ignoring the
12 fact that the SWP will operate for many decades to come. Because the FEIR
13 limits its climate-change analysis to 2035, it does not adequately capture

14 cumulative and reasonably foreseeable impacts to the CESA-Listed Fish

15 Species.

16 b. The FEIR fails to adequately disclose the Project's likely environmental

17 impacts on endangered and threatened fish species, including the CESA-Listed

18 Fish Species, during droughts. Through Temporary Urgency Change petitions

19 to the State Water Resources Control Board, DWR and Reclamation have

20 consistently secured changes to waive or weaken protective measures for these

21 and other species during California's recent drought, and will likely do so
22 again during future droughts. By omitting the impacts of similar waivers in the

23 future on the CESA-Listed Fish Species, the FEIR fails to disclose the
24 Project's true environmental impacts.

25 C. The FEIR improperly defines the Project's environmental baseline by, for

26 example, including the 2018 Addendum to the Coordinated Operation

27 Agreement in the baseline. The new baseline thereby obscures the Project's

28

29
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

true impact on endangered and threatened species, including the CESA-Listed
N m + Ut Fish Species, living in the Delta from implementation of the 2018 Addendum
to the Coordinated Operation Agreement, which was defined as part of the
Project in the Notice of Preparation.

d. The FEIR uses flawed and incomplete scientific modeling and analysis. For

6 instance, it fails to use credible scientific methods to analyze the impacts of

7 reduced Delta outflow on Longfin Smelt abundance and fails to adequately
co analyze the Project's entrainment-related impacts on Longfin Smelt population

abundance.
10 e. The FEIR fails to model all reverse Old and Middle River flow scenarios

11 authorized by the Project. These errors produced an FEIR that underestimates

12 the Project's impact on the CESA-Listed Fish Species.

13 146. These and other analytical flaws cause the FEIR to obscure the Project's true,
14 significant impacts.

15 IV. Failure to Identify Feasible Mitigation Measures to Avoid or Substantially Lessen
16 the Project's Significant Adverse Environmental Impacts

17 147. An EIR must describe feasible measures that could minimize project's significant
18 adverse impacts on the environment, and a public agency may not approve a project as proposed if it
19  excludes feasible mitigation measures that would substantially lessen the adverse environmental

20 impacts of a project.

21 148. Because DWR erroneously concludes that the Project and all of the alternatives will
22 cause no significant impacts across each and every fish species in the Delta, the FEIR fails to identify
23 any feasible or credible mitigation measures that would avoid or substantially lessen the Project's
24  significant adverse environmental impacts.

25 149. Because both DWR and DFW approved the Project in reliance on the FEIR, both
26 agencies violated CEQA by failing to identify feasible mitigation measures to lessen the Project's
27 significant impacts to the CESA-Listed Fish Species.

28

30
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

V. Failure to Adequately Analyze and Consider the Whole of the Action

2 150. CEQA requires that an EIR analyze the impacts of the whole of a project on the

3 environment.

4 151. The FEIR fails to adequately analyze and consider environmental impacts arising from
5 the whole of the Long-Term Operations Project for the following reasons, among others:

6 a. Failure to analyze the Project's upstream impacts, including with coordinated

7 CVP operations;

8 b. Failure to adequately analyze and consider the effects of implementing the
2018 Addendum to the Coordinated Operation Agreement; and

10 C. Failure to analyze the CVP's and SWP's coordinated operations.

11 VI. Failure to Accurately Analyze and Disclose the Project's Cumulative Impacts

12 152. An FEIR must fully consider a proposed project's cumulative impacts.

13 153. The FEIR fails to fully analyze and disclose the SWP's cumulative impacts by, for
14 example, failing to adequately account for impacts to the CESA-Listed Fish Species from the Project

15 in conjunction with the operation of the CVP.

16 154. The FEIR erroneously concludes that the Project's contributions to cumulative

17 impacts are not cumulatively significant. The FEIR admits that SWP operations and other past and
18 present projects have caused significant cumulative impacts on aquatic resources, including the
19 CESA-Listed Fish Species.

20 155. Coordinated operations of the SWP and CVP account for more than half of the total

21 water diversions in the Bay-Delta watershed in some years, and the decline of the CESA-Listed Fish
22 Species has accelerated as combined diversions of the CVP and SWP have increased over the past
23 several decades. Operations of the two projects adversely impact the CESA-Listed Fish Species, for
24 example, because they:

25 d. Reduce flow volume to San Francisco Bay;

26 b. Disrupt migration and rearing habitat in the Delta;

27 C. Cause significant direct mortality as a result of entrainment; and

28

31
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

d Release warm water into fish habitat below dams, killing juvenile fish and

eggs.

156. By failing to acknowledge that the SWP's long-term operations contribute
4 substantially to these adverse impacts, the FEIR fails to adequately analyze and fully disclose the
5 Long-Term Operations Project's cumulative impacts.

VII. Failure to Support "No Significance" Conclusion with Substantial Evidence

157. An agency abuses its discretion where it issues findings under CEQA that are not
supported by substantial evidence.

158. The best available science demonstrates that the CESA-Listed Fish Species in the
10 Delta and its watershed need increased protections. By (a) failing to account for the Project's effects
11 on reservoir storage, temperature, and release patterns upstream, (b) authorizing inadequate Delta
12 inflows and outflows, and (c) allowing increased water exports, the Project fails to improve, and in
13 some cases would worsen, existing conditions for fish species, including the CESA-Listed Fish
14 Species, that were already declining under the status quo.

15 159. DWR abused its discretion by concluding that the Long-Term Operations Project will
16 have no significant environmental impacts, since the FEIR's protective measures are inadequate to
17 render the Project's adverse impacts insignificant.

18 160. DFW abused its discretion by concluding that the Project will have no significant
19 impacts by relying on DWR's deficient FEIR and the inadequate mitigation measures in the ITP.
20 These measures may never occur and are insufficient by themselves to prevent further declines and
21 potential extinction of the CESA-Listed Fish Species.

22 161. DWR's and DFW's findings that the Project will not have significant impacts on the
23 CESA-Listed Fish Species are not supported by substantial evidence and are therefore an abuse of
24 discretion.

25 VII. Failure to Re-Circulate the FEIR for Additional Public Review and Comment

26 (DWR only)

27 162. An agency must recirculate an FEIR for additional public review and comment where

28

32
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 the FEIR contains significant new information or changes and/or is so fundamentally inadequate and

2 conclusory that meaningful public review and comment were precluded.

3 163. In the FEIR, DWR adopts and approves a newly created alternative, Refined
4 Alternative 2b, as the final Long-Term Operations Project. DWR never gave the public the
5 opportunity to review or comment on this alternative or its underlying analysis. DWR's failure to do
6 so violated CEQA.

7 164. DWR and DFW's failure to satisfy CEQA's environmental-review requirements
8 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and is actionable under California Public Resources Code

9 section 21168 and/or 21168.5 and California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and/or 1085.

10 165. Petitioners have a clear, present, and beneficial right to the proper performance by
11 DWR and DFW of their duties as alleged herein. Petitioners are beneficially interested in the

12 issuance of a writ of mandate by virtue of the facts set forth above, in that Petitioners and the general
13 public will otherwise be adversely affected by DWR and DFW's actions.

14 166. Because DWR and DFW believe their CEQA review was adequate, Petitioners have
15 no other plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law. Petitioners are entitled to seek a preemptory writ
16 of mandate declaring that Respondents have not satisfied the requirements of CEQA and to seek an
17 order vacating their approvals in furtherance of the Long-Term Operations Project.

18 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

19 (Violations of CESA Against DFW)
20 167. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference every allegation set forth above.

21 168. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by (1) issuing an ITP to DWR for
22 the Project without complying with the requirements of CESA; (2) by issuing a decision unsupported
23 by DFW's factual findings; and (3) by making factual findings not supported by the evidence.
24 Respondent's prejudicial abuses of discretion include the following:

25

26

27

28

33
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 I. DFW's "No Jeopardy" Conclusion Is Not Supported by the Evidence.

2 169. CESA forbids DFW from issuing an ITP where doing so would jeopardize the
3 continued existence of a species listed as threatened or endangered under CESA. In making this

4 determination, DFW must support its decision with substantial evidence.

170. DFW failed to support its determination that the ITP, which weakens protections for

6 the CESA-Listed Fish Species, will not jeopardize the continued existence of these Species.

7 171. Populations of the CESA-Listed Fish Species have continued to decline under the
8 previous set of CESA protections, including those tied to the 2008 and 2009 Biological Opinions.

172. Under adopted Refined Alternative 2b and the ITP, the Long-Term Operations Project

10 will only hasten the continuing decline of the CESA-Listed Fish Species. The ITP authorizes Delta
11 inflow, Delta outflow, and reverse Old and Middle River flow levels that will adversely impact
12 CESA-Listed Fish Species.

13 173. The Project's effects on temperatures and flows downstream of the CVP and SWP
14 reservoirs have not been analyzed, but they are likely to be highly detrimental to the incubating eggs
15 of CESA-listed Chinook Salmon.

16 174. The mitigation measures in the ITP fail to ensure that the Project's adverse impacts on

17 CESA-Listed Fish Species are fully mitigated.

18 175. The best available scientific information shows that the sharp declines of the CESA-
19 Listed Fish Species will not be arrested, and their extinction prevented, without increased protections.
20 Such protections include, among other things, improved temperature and flow conditions downstream
21 of CVP and SWP reservoirs, increased Delta outflows and Delta inflows, and measures such as
22 reduced export pumping to reduce entrainment (direct mortality) and indirect mortality of CESA-

23 Listed Fish Species from coordinated pumping by the SWP and CVP in the Delta.

24 176. The evidence shows that the ITP will not only fail to provide these protections, but in
25 fact will weaken protections for the CESA-Listed Fish Species that have been in place for the last
26 decade.

27 177. The State has already concluded that operations of the CVP under the federal

28

34
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Biological Opinions "are not scientifically adequate and fall short of protecting species and the state's
2 interests."

3 178. Accordingly, in light of the expected continuous adverse impacts on the CESA-Listed
4  Fish Species and other species from the coordinated operations of the CVP and SWP, and the State's

5 recent findings that Reclamation's operations of the CVP are not scientifically adequate and fall short

6 of protecting those species and the State's interests, the evidence does not support DFW's no-
7  jeopardy determination or its decision, in issuing the ITP. to allow DWR to catch, capture, and kill

8 these threatened and endangered species as part of the Long-Term Operations Project.

II. DFW's Finding that Conditions in the ITP Will Fully Mitigate Impacts to CESA-
10 Listed Fish Species Is Not Supported by the Evidence.

11 179. CESA requires DFW to find that mitigation measures fully mitigate and offset the
12 impacts to CESA-protected species, including the CESA-Listed Fish Species, caused by the Long-
13 Term Operations Project.

14 180. The best available scientific information shows that the declines in the CESA-Listed
15 Fish Species as a result of the CVP and SWP operations will not be arrested, and their extinction
16 prevented, without increased protections. Such protections include improved temperature and flow
17 controls in Chinook Salmon spawning and rearing habitats below SWP and CVP reservoirs,
18 increased Delta outflows and Delta inflows, and measures, such as reduced export pumping, to
19 reduce entrainment in the CVP and SWP export pumping infrastructure (direct mortality) and indirect
20 mortality for CESA-Listed Fish Species.

21 181. The FEIR finds that the incremental impacts of the Long-Term Operations Project
22 would worsen conditions for CESA-Listed Fish Species as compared to the environmental baseline.
23 This finding demonstrates that the ITP's protective measures will fail to fully mitigate adverse
24 impacts to CESA-Listed Fish Species from the incremental impacts of the Project.

25 182. The ITP fails to ensure that the Project's adverse impacts to the CESA-Listed Fish
26 Species, including reduced water flows into the Delta, higher upstream water temperatures,

27

28

35
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

entrainment and indirect mortality of CESA-Listed Fish Species related to water exports by the SWP
2 pumping facilities, and other impacts are fully mitigated.

183. The ITP authorizes Delta inflow, outflow, and Old and Middle River flow levels that

are insufficient to mitigate the impacts to the CESA-Listed Fish Species. Among other flaws, the ITP
5  determines that DWR is responsible only for mitigating its "proportional share" of the impacts of the
6 Project, which fails to meet CESA's obligation for state agencies "to conserve, protect, restore, and

7 enhance any endangered species or any threatened species and its habitat."

8 184. In addition to failing to fully mitigate the incremental impacts of the Project on CESA-

9 Listed Fish Species as compared to the environmental baseline, the ITP also fails to fully mitigate the
10| impacts that result from the operations of the State Water Project as a whole.

11 185. The mitigation measures described in the ITP are inadequate, vague, and
12 unenforceable, and therefore fail to ensure that the Project's adverse impacts on CESA-Listed Fish
13 Species are fully mitigated. For example, as in the FEIR, DFW relies on Reclamation to voluntarily
14 meet its proportional share of requirements. However, because Reclamation will operate under the
15 parameters set by the 2019 Biological Opinions, which impose no limit on the magnitude of reverse
16 Old and Middle River flows, there is no evidence that Reclamation will meet its proportional share of
17  these ITP requirements.

18 186. Accordingly, the evidence does not support DFW's findings that the Conditions of
19 Approval in the ITP are sufficient to minimize and fully mitigate the Project's impacts to CESA-
20 Listed Fish Species pursuant to Fish and Game Code section 2081(b)(2).

21 187. DFW's failure to satisfy its CESA obligations constitutes a prejudicial abuse of

22 discretion and is actionable under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 and/or 1085.

23 188. a Petitioners have a clear, present, and beneficial right to the proper performance by
24 DFW of its duties as alleged herein. Petitioners are beneficially interested in the issuance of a writ of
25 mandate by virtue of the facts set forth previously, in that Petitioners and the general public will
26 otherwise be adversely affected by DFW's actions.

27

28

36
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 189. Because DFW believes its actions under CESA were sufficient, Petitioners have no
2 other plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law. Petitioners are entitled to seek a preemptory writ of
3 mandate declaring that DFW has not satisfied the requirements of CESA and to seek an order

4 vacating its approval in furtherance of the Long-Term Operations Project, including the Project's

5 ITP.

Re: Notice of Intent to File CEQA and CESA Petition

Dear Director Nemeth and Director Bonham:

Pursuant to California Public Resources Code § 21167.5, please take notice that San Francisco Baykeeper, The Bay Institute, Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., Golden State Salmon Association, and Defenders of Wildlife intend to commence an action in the Superior
Court of California for the County of Alameda under the California Environmental Quality Act
("CEQA") against the Department of Water Resources ("DWR") and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("DFW"), and under the California Endangered Species Act ("CESA") against DFW, concerning DWR's and DFW's approvals of the project known as the Long-Term Operation of the State Water Project (*Project") and DFW's Incidental Take Permit No. 2081-
2019-066-00 ("ITP") for the Project. DWR certified the Final Environmental Impact Report for the Project on March 27, 2020, and filed a Notice of Determination with the Office of Planning
and Research on March 30, 2020.

The petition for writ of mandate filed in this action will allege, among other things, that DWR and DFW failed to properly follow CEQA's procedures and requirements including, but
not limited to: failure to maintain a consistent and adequate Project description, failure to analyze

Project's significant adverse environmental impacts, failure to adequately analyze and consider a reasonable range of alternatives, failure to analyze and disclose significant environmental
impacts, failure to identify feasible mitigation measures to avoid or substantially lessen the

the whole of the action, failure to adequately analyze and disclose the Project's cumulative
impacts, failure to support the "no significance" conclusion with substantial evidence, and, as to DWR only, failure to recirculate the Final Environmental Impact Report for additional public
review and comment.

The petition will also allege, among other things, that, under CESA, DFW's "no jcopardy" conclusion, as well as its conclusion that conditions in the ITP will fully mitigate impacts to CESA-listed fish species, are not supported by the evidence.

The petition will seek, among other things, a peremptory writ of mandate declaring that DWR and DFW have violated CEQA and CESA and vacating and setting aside the Project's
approvals, including the findings that the Project satisfies CEQA's and CESA's requirements,
until the Project is brought into full compliance with CEQA and CESA.

Please contact us if you require further information.

Re: Notice of Intent to File CEQA and CESA Petition

To Whom it May Concern:

Pursuant to California Public Resources Code 8 21167.7 and California Code of Civil
Procedure § 388, please take notice that San Francisco Baykeeper, The Bay Institute, Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., Golden State Salmon Association, and Defenders of Wildlife intend to commence an action in the Superior Court of California for the County of Alameda
under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") against the Department of Water Resources ("DWR") and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife ("DFW"), and under the California Endangered Species Act ("CESA") against DFW, concerning DWR's and DFW's approvals of the project known as the Long-Term Operation of the State Water Project
("Project") and DFW's Incidental Take Permit No. 2081-2019-066-00 ("ITP") for the Project.
DWR certified the Final Environmental Impact Report for the Project on March 27, 2020, and
filed a Notice of Determination with the Office of Planning and Research on March 30, 2020.

The petition for writ of mandate filed in this action, a copy of which is enclosed with this letter, will allege, among other things, that DWR and DFW failed to properly follow CEQA's procedures and requirements including, but not limited to: failure to maintain a consistent and adequate Project description, failure to analyze a reasonable range of alternatives, failure to analyze and disclose significant environmental impacts, failure to identify feasible mitigation
measures to avoid or substantially lessen the Project's significant adverse environmental impacts, failure to adequately analyze and consider the whole of the action, failure to adequately analyze and disclose the Project's cumulative impacts, failure to support the "no significance" conclusion
with substantial evidence, and, as to DWR only, failure to recirculate the Final Environmental Impact Report for additional public review and comment.
The petition will also allege, among other things, that, under CESA, DFW's "no jeopardy" conclusion, as well as its conclusion that conditions in the ITP will fully mitigate impacts to CESA-listed fish species, are not supported by the evidence.
The petition will seek, among other things, a peremptory writ of mandate declaring that DWR and DFW have violated CEQA and CESA and vacating and setting aside the Project's
approvals, including the findings that the Project satisfies CEQA's and CESA's requirements, until the Project is brought into full compliance with CEQA and CESA.
