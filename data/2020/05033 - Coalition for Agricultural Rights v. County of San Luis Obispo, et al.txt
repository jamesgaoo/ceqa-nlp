5 Respondents and Defendants County of San Luis Obispo and the Board of Supervisors of the
County of San Luis Obispo (collectively, "County"), alleging as follows:

I. INTRODUCTION

6 1.

7

8 The Coalition files this Petition to protect the rights of its members, the

9 agriculture community throughout the County and the State, and the general public to ensure the

BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 10 longstanding agricultural tradition of the State through lawful, reasoned public policy.
2.

1021 Anacapa Street, 2nd Floor Santa Barbara, CA 93101-2711 11 The Coalition includes members who have invested significantly in the hemp and

12 agricultural industry in the County of San Luis Obispo. In doing so, these members relied on the

13 County's stated policies and goals aimed at encouraging and fostering the development and

14 sustainability of the agriculture industry. The Petition seeks to rectify the County's failure to
uphold these policies and goals, and its violation of numerous laws.

3.

15

16 The Petition challenges the County's adoption of Ordinance No. 3414, an

17 Ordinance Amending Title 22 of the San Luis Obispo County Code, the Land Use Ordinance, By

18 Amending Various Sections Regarding Industrial Hemp Activities, Ordinance No. 3415, an

19 Ordinance Amending Title 23 of the San Luis Obispo County Code, the Coastal Zone Land Use
Ordinance, By Amending Various Sections Regarding Industrial Hemp Activities, and
Ordinance No. 3416, an Ordinance Amending Title 1 of the San Luis Obispo County Code By
20 Amending Section 1.05.080 Regarding Industrial Hemp Related Violations. These ordinances

21

22

23 impose regulatory requirements that will functionally eliminate the industrial hemp industry

24 within the County, unduly restrict the cultivation of a legal agricultural crop, and are the product

25 of unlawful decision-making by the Board of Supervisors ("Board"). As such, these ordinances

26 are referred to collectively as the "Hemp Prohibition." Attached hereto as Exhibits A, B, and C

4.

27 are true and correct copies of the ordinances comprising the Hemp Prohibition.

28 The Hemp Prohibition imposes undue and unnecessary restrictions on an already
severely constrained agriculture industry in the County and sets a disturbing precedent for
regulatory oversight of farmers' crop choice and business decisions. These actions threaten the
2

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

ongoing viability of the agriculture industry within the County, which has served as a

2 cornerstone of the County's economy and community for decades. Undermining the viability of

3 agricultural operations leads to the conversion of agricultural lands into residential and

4 commercial development, further stressing remaining nearby agricultural operations and leading

5 to increased agriculture, water, traffic, air quality, land use, and greenhouse gas impacts, among

6 others.

7 5. The hemp crop is a lifeline for the agricultural industry within the County. Hemp

8 requires minimal pesticide and herbicide use, and prevents the invasion of noxious weeds. Hemp

9 also is a powerful tool in carbon capture, soil remediation, and reducing air quality emissions.
10

Street, 2nd Floor 1021 Anacapa BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP (See Exhibit D, A Review on the Current State of Knowledge of Growing Conditions,

11 Agronomic Soil Health Practices and Utilities of Hemp in the United States (April 2020) MDPI, IILZ-LOTE6 VO 'MIRQIRE BIURS 12 Agriculture 2020.) These benefits are critical to the farmers and communities in the County who

13 deal with high costs for land, a limited water supply, and pesticide, soil remediation, and air

14 quality issues.

15 6. Furthermore, in 2019, the County acknowledged that its agricultural industry is

16 too reliant on two crops (wine and strawberries), creating unnecessary risks to the industry if

17 these crops are rendered unviable due to market fluctuations or the casualty of a pest or natural

18 disaster. Hemp offers a solution to these issues--permitting an opportunity for farmers to

19 diversify their crops, while reducing their water demand and improving the quality of their soil.
20 7. Hemp farmers in the County spent significant resources developing their

21 businesses over the past several years. They made necessary arrangements and signed contracts

22 for the delivery of expensive and scarce industrial hemp seeds and/or plant clones; obtained

23 financing on this new high-risk crop through investors, banks, and financial institutions; secured
24 off-take agreements between the farmers and their buyers to purchase future crops of industrial

25 hemp; developed marketing plans for their product; prepared their lands for cultivation with

26 activities such as tilling, watering, and amending the soil, installing weed mat and irrigation
27 infrastructure, and building hoop houses and other cultivation facilities; and invested in drying

28 and extraction facilities for harvesting and processing of this agricultural crop. The County's
3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Hemp Prohibition undermines the vast majority of this work, as it prohibits the cultivation of

2 hemp on the vast majority of parcels in the County, and makes cultivation on the remaining

3 parcels economically infeasible. It also discourages investment in hemp cultivation as it creates

4 regulatory uncertainty.

5 8. Additionally, the Hemp Prohibition will lead to innumerable significant

6 environmental impacts. Farmers will be forced to shift to different crops, making hemp's

7 potential benefits to the County's agricultural industry, water supply, greenhouse gas emissions,

8 hazards, and air quality unattainable. Further, the increased regulation on the County's

0 agriculture industry will lead to the conversion of agricultural land to urban development, which,
in itself, is a significant environmental impact, but may also lead to further agricultural, water

11 1001A puz 43975 edessay IZol d'TT 'MJTHHOS HUGAVA LIVAH NIAISNMONA 10

supply, greenhouse gas, hazards, air quality, land use, urban sprawl, growth inducement, energy, 93101-2711 12 and transportation impacts.
S 13 9. Unsurprisingly, the Hemp Prohibition runs afoul of State law and local land use EIEqIeE TICES 14 regulations, including, but not limited to, the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA")

15 (Pub. Res. Code, § 21000, et seq.), the State Planning and Zoning Law (Gov. Code, § 65000, et

16 seq.), the Right to Farm Act (Civ. Code, § 3482.5), the County's Right to Farm Ordinance

17 (County Code, §§ 5.16), the County's General Plan, and the County's zoning ordinance.

18 Similarly, the County acted without any evidentiary support or rationale in adopting the Hemp

19 Prohibition.

20 10. In sum, agricultural operations are businesses that by definition generally create

21 impacts on their neighbors, and yet the County has never adopted the regulations imposed on

22 hemp for any other crop. The County was arbitrary and capricious in singling out hemp

23 cultivation in the Hemp Prohibition.

24 11. For these reasons, the Coalition respectfully seeks a writ of mandate requiring the
County to rescind, void, and vacate the Hemp Prohibition. The Coalition also prays for 25

26 appropriate injunctive relief to maintain the status quo and allow farmers to plant crops they have

27 invested in and planned to plant this year. Thus, the Coalition seeks to prevent the County from

28
4

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

taking further actions to implement or proceed with the Hemp Prohibition during the pendency
2 of this litigation and prior to complying with all applicable laws.

3 II. PARTIES AND STANDING

4 12. Plaintiff and Petitioner Coalition for Agricultural Rights is a Wyoming nonprofit

5 mutual benefit corporation, with its principal place of business located at 1191 4th St., Los Osos,

6 California 93402. The Coalition was formed to support the hemp industry within the County,
7 and more immediately challenge the County's arbitrary and illegal actions in adopting the Hemp

8 Prohibition. The Coalition is in support of reasonable regulation of hemp, but the Hemp

9 Prohibition goes too far, violates numerous laws, and ignores public input from residents
BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 10 throughout the County. The Coalition was required to organize under short timelines, given the
11 County's failure to notice its intent to adopt the Hemp Prohibition. Due to the California LILZ-IOTE6 VO 'RIRBQIUE BIUES 1001Z puz 9301S Anacapa 17OI 12 Secretary of State's limited operations as a result of the ongoing covid-19 pandemic, the

13 Coalition was forced to organize under Wyoming law, which offered online business formation

14 services. The Coalition has submitted registration information and paid the applicable fee to the

15 California Secretary of State to conduct business within California.

16 13. The Coalition's members include hemp farmers, researchers, and businesses

17 throughout the County, some of which have been engaged in the hemp industry for nearly the

18 past decade. Generally, these members are farming operations and businesses that have been

19 working the County's lands for years, cultivating crops, engaging in commerce, and helping to
20 drive the County's economy. In recent years, these members have farmed industrial hemp in
21 accordance with applicable laws and regulations for both research and commercial purposes, and
22 have greatly contributed to the developing hemp business throughout the State and the continued

23 success of agriculture within the County.

24 14. The Hemp Prohibition has drastically injured the Coalition's members through its

25 arbitrary, unlawful restrictions. When applied, the Hemp Prohibition's restrictions prevent

26 outdoor hemp cultivation on any parcel less than 400 acres in sizea significant number of the

27 parcels within the County do not meet this threshold. The vast majority of outdoor cultivation
28 sites in the County are immediately rendered unusable due to the Hemp Prohibition's egregious
5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

property line setbacks and one-mile buffer around Urban Reserve Lines

2 ("URL") and Village

3 Reserve Lines ("VRL"). The Hemp Prohibition bans flowering hemp from being cultivated in
all greenhouses that lie on

4 Rural Residential land, and immediately eliminates all hemp

5 cultivation within the Edna Valley, as well as any cultivation in hoop houses. These are only a

6 few examples of the Hemp Prohibition's impact on the Coalition's members and the agriculture

7 industry within the county. In total, the restrictions operate as a de facto prohibition on hemp
cultivation within the County.

8 15. As a

9 result of the Hemp Prohibition, the Coalition's members are immediately

LLVAH NITISNMONg dTT 'XOTINOS HHHäVA 10 and irreparably damaged. Expensive property, materials, and services purchased to cultivate

11 hemp this year will be worthless. Hemp seedlings purchased and grown for the 2020 growing

10012 puz q30nS edaozuy RIRQIRH HURS TILZ-IOTE6 VO 12 season will not be planted. Hemp plants currently in the ground risk being eliminated. Brands

13 developed to sell the farmer' crop will be without a product. Time and money spent developing

14 and pursuing research partnerships for hemp crop will be wasted. Members, including

15 researchers conducting critical scientific studies on hemp, will lose this growing season, missing

16 out on important discoveries and opportunities to establish themselves and their brand at a
critical time in a burgeoning industry.

17 16.

18 Furthermore, the public, including the Coalition's members, is negatively

19 impacted by the Hemp Prohibition. The agriculture industry within the County will experience

increased

20 pressures to convert to more economically viable uses. The residents of the County

21 will experience the unanalyzed environmental impacts from the Board's action. The consumers,

22 including those that rely on hemp's medicinal uses, are left without their product. And the
agriculture industry across the County and the State will face an unlawful precedent for
23 discrimination against legal agriculture practices, the violation of the law, and the undue

24 regulation of farming practices.

25 17.

26 In sum, the Coalition's members have been, are being, and will continue to be

27 adversely affected and irreparably injured by the Hemp Prohibition. The Coalition's

28 organizational missions have been, are being, and will continue to be frustrated by the Hemp
Prohibition, which is damaging agriculture and business within the County. The Coalition has
6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1

2 been, is being, and will continue to be required to divert organizational resources to oppose the

3 Hemp Prohibition and to ensure the Hemp Prohibition is not allowed to proceed.

18.

4 The Coalition's members' interests are germane to the Coalition's stated purposes

5 and goals, and will be directly affected by the Hemp Prohibition. The members and the

6 Coalition further have a direct and beneficial interest in the County's compliance with all

7 applicable laws, including, but not limited to, CEQA, the State Planning and Zoning Law, the

8 Right to Farm Act, the County's Right to Farm Ordinance, the County's General Plan, and the

9 County's zoning ordinance. Indeed, the Coalition and their members, agents, employees and

BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 10 families will be directly affected by the lack of environmental review of the Hemp Prohibition.

11 They will suffer the unanalyzed environmental impacts of the Hemp Prohibition, such as the

Barbara, CA 93101-2711 4001z puz soans edeaeny 1021 12 impacts to water quality and quantity, agriculture, hazards, land use, air quality, greenbouse

13 gasses, and growth inducement. As members of the general public, moreover, the Coalition's

14 members possess an interest in protecting public resources present in the area, and ensuring

15 compliance with State and local land use law. The Coalition is suing on its behalf, and on behalf

16 of others who will be affected by the Hemp Prohibition, as well as for all citizens more broadly,

17 including those who seek to maintain the integrity and fairness of the environmental review and
land use entitlement process.

18 19.

19 Defendant County of Santa Luis a Obispo is a political subdivision of the State of

20 California. The County is responsible for regulating and controlling land use within the County,

21 including ensuring compliance with the State Planning and Zoning Law, the Right to Farm Act,

22 and the County's Right to Farm Ordinance, General Plan, and zoning ordinance. The County is

23 also charged with ensuring compliance with CEQA as the lead agency for the Hemp Prohibition.

24 The County owed a mandatory duty to act within the boundaries of its legal authorities under

25 applicable laws, including CEQA, the State Planning and Zoning Law, the Right to Farm Act,

26 and the County's Right to Farm Ordinance, General Plan, and zoning ordinance in exercising its
discretion to approve the Hemp Prohibition.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 20. Defendant Board of Supervisors of the County of San Luis Obispo is the elected
2 governing body of the County of San Luis Obispo and is the body responsible for the decision at

3 issue herein,

4 21, The Coalition is currently unaware of the true names and capacities of

5 Respondents and Defendants DOES 1 through 10, inclusive, and therefore sues those parties by

6 fictitious names. The Coalition will amend this Petition to allege their true names and capacities
7 when the same has been ascertained.

8 III. JURISDICTION AND VENUE

9 22. This Petition is brought pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 1060,
BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 10 1085, and 1094.5, Government Code section 65000, et seq. and Public Resources Code section

11
1TLZ-10LE6 VO RrEqIBEr NHURS J0014 puz 1907S Anacapa IZOL 21000, et seq. This Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the above provisions and

12 because the County is a local agency operating within the jurisdictional limits of the County of

13 San Luis Obispo.

14 23. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 394

15 and 395 because the Hemp Prohibition was adopted in, and impacts the residents of, the County,

16 and because all of the acts and omissions complained of took place within the County. The

17 Coalition conducts business in the County of San Luis Obispo, and its members either conduct

18 business and/or reside within the County. Venue is also proper in this Court because the County

19 is a local agency situated in the County of San Luis Obispo.

20 IV. EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

21 24. The Coalition's members have consistently participated in the County's public

22 processes relating to the regulation of hemp. They objected to the County's adoption of urgency

23 ordinances in the summer of 2019 prohibiting the cultivation of hemp within the County; they
24 participated in the County staff's development of a draft permanent ordinance and the Planning

25 Commission's hearing regarding that draft permanent ordinance; and they objected to the

26 Board's adoption of the Hemp Prohibition, including, but not limited to, prior to and at the

27 Board's May 5, 2020 meeting.

28
8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 25. The grounds for noncompliance with all applicable laws alleged herein are

2 consistent with the objections raised by the Coalition prior to the adoption of the Hemp

3 Prohibition.

4 26. If any grounds for overturning and invalidating the Hemp Prohibition alleged

5 herein were, for some reason, not raised prior to adoption of the Hemp Prohibition it was because

6 there was no meaningful opportunity for members of the public to raise those objections prior to
7 the approval of the Hemp Prohibition, or because the County failed to give notice required by

8 law.

9 27. The Coalition has exhausted its administrative remedies.

10 V. GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

10012 puz yoong edereay 1021 LIVAH NITISNMONA 'ARBER SCHRECK, LLP 11 A. Agriculture Is Vital Component to the County Economy and Community 11AZ-L01E6 VD 'UIEQIUE BIUTS 12 28. The agricultural industry has been a cornerstone of the County's economy and

13 community for more than a century. The industry provides jobs to the community, feeds

14 residents across the State, and provides important tax dollars to local regulatory agencies.

15 29. In November 2019, the County released its Economic Contributions of San Luis

16 Obispo County Agriculture, Crop Report Plus ("Report"), which estimated the County's

17 agriculture industry contributes $2.54 billion to the local economy and supports nearly 14,000

18 jobs.

19 30. However, the Report found that this industry faces many risks, including

20 "droughts, floods, disease outbreaks, new regulations, new competitors, labor availability and

21 cost, price drops, and rising costs for fuel, equipment, and other inputs." (Report, p. 12.) The

22 Report concludes that these risks are particularly troubling given the County's "growing

23 dependence on strawberries and wine grapes," which account for more than 50% of the crop

24 value in the County. (Id. at 14.)

25 31. The Executive Director of the County's Farm Bureau commented on the
26 importance of the Report:

27 The report equips decisionmakers and community leaders to better
28 understand how agriculture is interconnected with our entire economy. When we make policies about water infrastructure, land
9

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

use, or other regulations, impacts to agriculture must be considered a in a broader, economy-wide perspective. This county's prosperity 2 depends on keeping our farmers and ranchers in business.
32. Despite its productivity, the County acknowledges that there "is continuing and

4 increasing pressure to convert" agricultural lands to residential and domestic uses. (County

5 General Plan, Agriculture Element, p. 2-9.) The California Legislature and the County have

6 taken numerous actions to preserve this vital industry within the County.

7 33. For example, the Legislature adopted the Right to Farm Act, which provides:
(a)(1) No agricultural activity, operation, or facility, or
thereof, conducted or maintained for appurtenances commercial purposes, and in a manner consistent with proper and accepted customs and standards, as established and followed by J'TT 'NOIHHOS NARAVA BROWNSTEIN HYATT 10 similar agricultural operations in the same locality, shall be or become a nuisance, private or public, due to any changed 11 condition in or about the locality, after it has been in operation for ITLZ-LOTE6 VO BIRQIEA BIUES 100TA puz 90ang edeavuy 1201 more than three years if it was not a nuisance at the time it began . 12

13 (d) This section shall prevail over any contrary provision of any ordinance or regulation of any city, county, city and county, or 14 other political subdivision of the state. However, nothing in this section shall preclude a city, county, city and county, or other 15 political subdivision of this state, acting within its constitutional or statutory authority and not in conflict with other provisions of state
16 law, from adopting an ordinance that allows notification to a prospective homeowner that the dwelling is in close proximity to an 17 agricultural activity, operation, facility, or appurtenances thereof and is subject to the provisions of this section consistent with 18 Section 1102.6a.

19 (Civ. Code, § 3482.5 [emphasis added].)

20 34. Consistent with the Right to Farm Act, the County has enacted its own Right to

21 Farm Ordinance, which includes the following policy and regulation:

22 Where non-agricultural land uses occur near agricultural areas, Agricultural Operations frequently become the subjects of nuisance 23 complaints due to lack of information about such operations. As a result, agricultural operators may be forced to cease or curtail their
farm 24 operations. Such actions discourage investments in improvements to the detriment of agricultural uses and the viability 25 of the County's agricultural industry as a whole. It is the purpose and intent of this ordinance to reduce the loss to the County of 26 its agricultural resources by clarifying the circumstances under which Agricultural Operations may be considered a nuisance.
27 (County Code, § 5.16.020(2) [emphasis added.)

28 No agricultural activity, operation, or facility, or appurtenances
10

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- thereof, conducted or maintained for commercial purposes, and
2 in a manner consistent with proper and accepted customs and standards, as established and followed by similar Agricultural

3 operations in the same locality, shall be or become a nuisance, private or public, due to any changed condition in or about the

4 locality, after it has been in operation for more than three years if it was not a nuisance at the time it began. 5.16.031(1) [emphasis added].) (County Code, §

5
35.
6 The County's General Plan also includes numerous provisions protecting the
agriculture industry. For example, the Mission Statement of the County General Plan
7 Agriculture Element is to identify "those areas of the county with productive farms, ranches and
8
soils, and establish goals, policies and implementation measures that will enable their long-term
0

10 stability and productivity." (County General Plan, Agriculture Element, p. 1-1.) The Agriculture

11 Element states that a "strong commitment to agriculture" is required to "to reduce the pressure to
1001x puz q3ang edaoeay Izot d'TIXJIIHOS HIHAVA LLVAH NIMISNMOHA Santa Barbara, CA 93101-2711 convert productive lands to urban uses," while warning that once "agricultural land is converted
12

13 to non-agricultural use, it is virtually impossible to remove the non-agricultural use and convert

14 the land back to agricultural production." (Id. at 2-9.) Further, given the changing agricultural
uses within the County, the Agriculture Element acknowledges "the need to establish policies
15

16 governing agricultural land use which are flexible and can respond to changing needs and

17 opportunities." (Id. at 2-10.) Finally, the Agriculture Element warns that, given the growing

18 population, it is "important to maintain a strong agricultural 'right-to-farm' ordinance, as well as
strong policies that will ensure appropriate buffers between new development and ongoing
19 agricultural operations." (Id. at 2-11.)
20
36. In light of these statements, the County General Plan Agriculture Element
21
provides, among other things, the following goals, policies, and implementation measures:
22

23 Facilitate agricultural production by allowing a broad range of uses and agricultural support services to be consistently and accessible
24 ocated in areas of prime agricultural activity. (Agricultural Goal 1.b.)

25 Establish land-use policies in this element that support the

26 needs of agriculture without impeding its long-term viability. (Agricultural Goal 2.c.)

27 Maintain and protect agricultural lands from inappropriate

B. Hemp Cultivation Is a Blossoming Sector of the County Agricultural Industry
24
38. "Industrial hemp" or "hemp" is defined as "an agricultural product, whether 25 growing or not, that is limited to types of the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, 26 including the seeds of the plant and all derivatives, extracts, the resin extracted from any part of

2 Ag. Code, § 8100(a)(6).)

3 39. The entirety of hemp plant is a useable product, from its seeds, stems and roots

4 to its leaves and flowers. Hemp is most commonly known for its versatility and sustainability, as

5 it can be used to create paper, building material, fabric, plastic composites and beauty products,

6 which typically require more environmentally-imposing materials and processes. However, the

7 mere practice of hemp cultivation also benefits the soil and the environment-it serves as great

8 cover crop, preventing weeds from inhabiting soil; it captures carbon dioxide from the

9 atmosphere, reducing greenhouse gas emissions; it is cultivated with minimal pesticides and
aTT'XOHAHOS HUHaVA LIVAH NIZISNMONg 10 herbicides; and, it requires very little water to grow. (See Exhibit D.) In a state like California,

11 where agriculture rides the drought and deluge weather cycle, hemp's benefits make it a critical ITAZ-I0166 VD 'EIRQIBE BIOBS 10011 puz to3ng 2deseny 1ZOl 12 opportunity for the industry,

13 40. In addition to all of these economic and environmental benefits, hemp is well

14 suited for the agriculture industry in the County. Hemp's low water use will prove a particularly

15 advantageous trait as County growers- dependent on local groundwater for crop irrigation-face

16 potential restrictions on extraction triggered by implementation of the state's Sustainable

17 Groundwater Management Act (Wat. Code, § 10720, et seq.), which took effect in 2015 and will
18 be implemented over the next 20 years.

19 41. On January 1, 2019, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (*2018 Farm Bill")

20 became law and removed "hemp" from the definition of marijuana in the Controlled Substances

21 Act. (21 U.S.C., § 812.) The Bill created a binary regulatory scheme for hemp cultivation. The

22 Bill permits states to be the primary regulatory authority over the production of hemp by

23 submitting a regulatory plan to the Department of Agriculture for review and approval. (7

24 U.S.C., § 1639(p).) The state plan must include testing procedures, disposal measures, and

25 enforcement actions, among other things. (Ibid.) In the absence of a state plan and if the
26 production of hemp is not otherwise prohibited by the state, hemp production is regulated by a

27 plan adopted by the Department of Agriculture. (Ibid.)

1 42. In California, the Food & Agriculture Code allows the growing of hemp SO long

2 as the grower "register[s] with the commissioner of the county in which the grower intends to

3 engage in industrial hemp cultivation" and the "commissioner determines that the requirements

4 for registration" are met. (Food & Ag. Code, § 81003.) The Food & Agriculture Code § also

5 requires the Secretary of Agriculture to submit a state hemp plan to the United State Secretary of

6 Agriculture by May 1, 2020 for review and approval pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill. (Food &

7 Ag. Code, § 81015.) On information and belief, California has met its deadline to submit a state

8 plan to the Secretary of Agriculture and the final plan should be approved shortly.

9 43. In November 2017, the County adopted its cannabis ordinances. The ordinances
J'TT'XOTHHOS HUAHYA LIVAH NIMISNMOHg 10 defined industrial hemp cultivation in the same manner as State law, and included hemp

11 cultivation within the "Crop Production and Grazing" land use. (See County Code, § 22.80.030.) IILZ-IOIE6 VD 'ErBqIEE TIUES 3001d puz tyeans adeoeuy 1Z0l 12 Crop Production and Grazing is primarily a use by right, meaning the County left the regulation

significant development for the 14 44. The County's cannabis ordinances were a

15 County's agricultural industry. It permitted farmers the opportunity to diversify their crops

16 through hemp cultivation, while reducing water demand and pesticide use and improving soil

17 quality.

18 45. Accordingly, in 2018, the Coalition's members started considering hemp

19 cultivation given its significant economic, agricultural, and environmental benefits and the

20 anticipated decriminalization of the crop by the 2018 Farm Bill. Some of these members even

21 planted hemp in 2018 for research purposes, as permitted by State and County regulations.

22 46. After the 2018 Farm Bill became law and after the State authorized the issuances

23 of hemp registrations on May 1, 2019, several of the Coalition's members planted their hemp

24 crop in the spring of 2019 pursuant to existing ordinances, either by obtaining commercial

25 registration or by being affiliated with a research institution. On information and belief, the vast

26 majority of hemp cultivation within the County coexisted with neighboring uses, including

27 adjacent residential, commercial, and agricultural uses.

1 47. Despite this coexistence, during the public comment period at its May 21, 2019

2 meeting, Supervisor Peschong made a motion to direct staff to bring forward an urgency

3 ordinance "in relation to setbacks" for hemp cultivation. The item was not agendized and the

4 only reason given for the motion was that Supervisor Peschong had received comments over the

5 past 48-hours concerning hemp. This was the first step leading to the County's arbitrary,

6 unlawful adoption of the Hemp Prohibition.

7 C. The County Arbitrarily Adopted the Hemp Prohibition

8 48. After its May 21, 2019 meeting, the Board undertook actions over the course of a

any 9 year to prohibit hemp cultivation within the County. These actions were not based on
BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 10 evidence, violate multiple laws and the County's own General Plan and zoning ordinance,

10014 puz 4aans 1021 Anacapa 11 unduly restrict agriculture in the County, and ignore significant opposition from the Supervisors' 1TLT-10T€6 VO 'EIEQIEg BIUBS 12 constituents. These actions are detailed below.

49. At its June 18, 2019 meeting, County staff presented an urgency ordinance 13

14 generally prohibiting hemp cultivation within the County to the Board. The draft ordinance

15 ignored the Board's May 21, 2019 motion to develop a setback ordinance, and cited
16 unsubstantiated odor, nuisance, and public safety concerns as the grounds for the ordinance. The

17 ordinance provides:

18 Notwithstanding anything in the County Code to the contrary,
19 during the term of this Ordinance, including any extensions hereto, except as allowed in Section 5, no industrial hemp, as defined in

20 County Code, shall be grown for any purposes within the unincorporated areas of San Luis Obispo County. Cultivation of
21 industrial hemp in violation of this Ordinance constitutes a public nuisance.

22 The draft urgency ordinance, however, exempted sixteen commercial hemp growers who had
23 already been issued a registration by the Agricultural Commissioner's office and several research

24 cultivators.

25 50. The staff report for the urgency ordinance warned the Board that: "If adopted,

26 this ordinance would establish the first agricultural commodity regulated by San Luis Obispo
27 County in this manner . . [T]he agricultural industry in San Luis Obispo County is concerned
28 over the precedent that this action would set for future regulation of other agricultural
15

1 commodities." The staff report further commented that: (1) the ordinance may have an impact

2 on businesses that have based all or part of their business plan on production of industrial hemp;

3 and, (2) the value of hemp is approximately $60,000 per acre. Attached hereto as Exhibit E is a

4 true and correct copy of County staff report on the urgency ordinance.

5 51. Disregarding the significant opposition to the urgency ordinance, the lack of any

6 evidence supporting the ordinance, and numerous violations of the law, the Board adopted

7 Ordinance No. 3393, an Urgency Ordinance of the County of San Luis Obispo Declaring a

8 Temporary Moratorium on the Cultivation of Industrial Hemp Within the Unincorporated Areas

9 of San Luis Obispo County ("Urgency Moratorium"), which became effective on June 18, 2019
d'TI 'XJTHHOS MUTHVA LIVAH NITLSNMOHH 10 for 45 days. The Board further directed staff to establish an industrial hemp advisory group, and
11
ELZZ-IOLE6 VO 'RIZQIEA BIUES develop a permanent hemp ordinance. 1021 Anacapa Street, 2nd Floor 12 52. On July 2, 2019, the Agricultural Liaison Advisory Board ("ALAB") submitted a
13 letter to the Board expressing its concerns with the Urgency Moratorium. The ALAB is a local

14 agriculture and land use advisory board, comprised of a variety of stakeholders within the

15 County (c.g., farmers, environmental representatives, vineyard owners, etc.). The letter

16 emphasized that hemp is a legal crop and should not be regulated in a manner different than

17 other legal crops. The letter warned that such treatment could create precedent for future

18 regulation of other legal agricultural commodities. Attached hereto as Exhibit F is a true and

19 correct copy of ALAB's letter.

20 53. At its July 16, 2019 regular meeting, County staff presented an ordinance
21 extending the Urgency Moratorium for a period of 12 months. The staff report on the extension

22 of the Urgency Ordinance noted that currently there were sixteen registered commercial growers

23 cultivating hemp on 427 acres in the County, and another eight entities cultivating hemp for

24 research purposes. The staff report also informed the Board that development of the permanent

25 hemp ordinance would require input from an industry advisory group, research from staff in

26 multiple departments, ordinance preparation, environmental review, and a Planning Commission

27 and Board hearing. The staff report estimated that this work could be completed by June 2020.

1 54. Again, despite the significant opposition and the lack of any evidence supporting

2 its decision, the Board adopted Ordinance No. 3394, an Ordinance of the County of San Luis

3 Obispo Extending Urgency Ordinance No. 3393, Which Establishes a Temporary Moratorium on

4 the Cultivation of Industrial Hemp Within the Unincorporated Areas of San Luis Obispo County,

5 which extended the Urgency Moratorium for 12 months, until and through June 18, 2020. The

6 Board further directed staff to develop a permanent hemp ordinance based upon land use, parcel

7 size, and setbacks in cooperation with ALAB. The Board directed that the permanent ordinance

8 be prepared by March 2020 so as to ensure the 2020 planting season was not impacted. The

9 Board did not direct staff to develop a prohibition on hemp cultivation within the County.
dTT'XOMHHOS AHaaVA LIVAH NIZISNMOHA 10 55. After the Urgency Moratorium was extended, the Coalition's members spent a

J0014 puz 1334S 11 significant amount of time and effort over the course of the next six months developing the draft
Barbara, CA 93101-27 12 permanent ordinance. The intent of this effort was to develop a draft a permanent ordinance that

13
1021 Anacapa would satisfy concerns of all competing stakeholder interests, while reasonably permitting the

14 cultivation of hemp within the County.

15 56. For example, at its August 5, 2019 meeting, ALAB established a subcommittee to

16 work with County staff to draft a permanent hemp ordinance. Members of the subcommittee

17 included representatives from the Coalition, the hemp industry, and the wine industry, the Farm
18 Bureau Executive Director, and an Edna Valley vineyard owner. The subcommittee set three

19 meetings in August 2019 to discuss the permanent hemp ordinance, with the goal of reaching

20 consensus on the Board's direction to establish a permanent ordinance based on zoning

21 requirements, setbacks, and minimum parcel sizes.

22 57. On September 9, 2019, the ALAB subcommittee presented "areas of consensus"

23 as to the permanent hemp ordinance to ALAB. The members of the subcommittee agreed that

24 "any setbacks that may be established should be measured from a particular identified use off-
25 site from the hemp grower's parcel and not from the hemp grower's property line," and that

26 minimum parcel sizes should not be required for hemp cultivation. However, the subcommittee

27 did not reach consensus as to the actual setbacks to be imposed, with suggestions ranging from

28 50 feet to one-half mile. Finally, the subcommittee discussed, but could not agree upon, an
17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 "overlay disallowing hemp cultivation in the Edna Valley." The ALAB approved the

2 subcommittee's recommendations and directed the subcommittee to continue its work

3 throughout the fall.

4 58. The ALAB subcommittee met again in October, November, and December 2019

any 5 to discuss the permanent hemp ordinance. The subcommittee did not reach consensus on

6 additional issues relating to the permanent hemp ordinance, but generally discussed 1,000 feet as

7 the most restrictive setback to be imposed, depending upon the adjacent "sensitive use" and the

8 size of the hemp cultivation. The results of these further discussions were presented to the

9 ALAB at its December 9, 2019 meeting. After hearing the results, the ALAB moved to send a

10 letter to the Planning Department to make recommendations on the Planning Department's draft

1021 Anacapa J0014 puz 9091)S J'TT*NOAHHOS MIAHVA LIVAA NITISNMOHH 11
LILZ-IOLE6 VO EIEQITA BIUES permanent ordinance.

12 59. While the ALAB subcommittee was working to develop consensus around a draft

13 permanent ordinance, County staff prepared its own draft of the permanent ordinance. This draft

14 was released for public comment on November 11, 2019.

15 60. On December 18, 2019, ALAB sent a letter to County staff recommending five
16 actions with respect to the permanent hemp ordinance: (1) the permanent ordinance should

17 "minimize[] conflicts with existing agricultural operations and businesses;" (2) the County staff

18 should "consider the implementation of a sliding scale for setback requirements based upon the

19 number of industrial hemp acres being cultivated;" (3) the permanent ordinance should not

20 include riparian and wetland setbacks; (4) the Agricultural Commissioner's office should

21 develop best management practices for the cultivation of industrial hemp, which should be

22 incorporated into the industrial hemp registration process; and, (5) the County should review the

23 permanent ordinance annually to determine whether the ordinance should be amended as new

24 research on potential impacts of hemp cultivation becomes available. Attached hereto as Exhibit

25 G is true and correct copy of ALAB's letter.

26 61, After receiving the result of the ALAB subcommittee's work and ALAB's letter,

27 as well as other stakeholder input, the County staff revised the draft permanent ordinance for

28 presentation to the Planning Commission.
18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 62.

2 The Planning Commission considered the draft permanent ordinance at its

3 January 23, 2020 meeting. The staff report for the item stated that the draft ordinance was

4 developed "based on Board Direction, ALAB subcommittee, and public comment." Key

5 provisions of the ordinance were as follows: (1) hemp cultivation is a subcategory of Crop

6 Production and Grazing subject to specific land use requirements, but not requiring discretionary

7 review; (2) outdoor hemp cultivation will be limited to Agriculture, Rural Lands, and Residential

8 Rural (non-flowering transplants only) land use categories and sites of ten acres or larger (five
acres for indoor cultivation); (3) outdoor hemp

9 cultivation may not be "located within three-

10 will be measured from the location of the proposed hemp cultivation to the nearest point of the
1021 Anacapa Street, 2nd Floor JTT'MOINMOS HIHAVA LIVAH NIISNMOHg hundred (300) feet of certain alleged sensitive uses, including URLs and VRLs; and, (4) setbacks

11
Santa Barbara, TIZZ-LOLE6 VO alleged existing sensitive use or area boundary.

12 63.

13 Of particular note, the draft permanent ordinance presented to the Planning

14 Commission imposed fewer restrictions on the cultivation of "industrial hemp transplants"-e.g.,

15 permitting outdoor transplant cultivation within Residential Rural areas. Transplant cultivation

16 is limited to germination and vegetative stages of planting, with the plants being transported

17 elsewhere for their budding and flowering stages, so transplant cultivation does not have the

18 same alleged odor impacts as cultivating hemp through all stages of its lifecycle hemp's odor is

19 typically associated with the budding and flowering stages. Accordingly, County staff reasoned

20 that transplant cultivation should be subject to less restrictive regulations than other outdoor
cultivation.

21 64.

22 The Planning Commission staff report provided the following reasons for not
extending the setback distance:

23

24 There is a lack of currently available scientific research on hemp odor or the potential for terpene taint affecting crops

25 such as grapes, making it difficult to determine logical rationale for specific distance. It is likely that this research will

26 be forthcoming in the near future. The setback distances for outdoor (300 ft) and indoor (100 ft) cultivation are consistent with those in

27 the Cannabis Ordinance, although in the Cannabis ordinance these setbacks are from property lines for outdoor cultivation and from

28 specific offsite uses for indoor cultivation. The proposed setbacks for the Industrial Hemp Ordinance are based on setbacks from specific uses rather than property lines. The 1,000-foot setback 19
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

from "sensitive receptors" in the Cannabis Ordinance was not incorporated into the Industrial Hemp Ordinance for two reasons. 2 The first is that the term "sensitive receptor" has a specific meaning per the California Health and Safety Code. Sensitive receptor 3 provisions under the California Health and Safety Code don't relate to agricultural odors. The second is that the 1,000-foot setback was 4 taken from Proposition 64 aimed at diversion to minors because of Cannabis's status as a federally illegal schedule 1 drug, which is not 5 the case with hemp. This standard was not based on odor.

6 (Emphasis added.) The staff report also acknowledged that the proposed ordinance was the

7 product of significant stakeholder input and County staff effort.

8 65. After receiving public comment, the Planning Commission recommended the

9 Board adopt the permanent ordinance as presently drafted with the following modifications: (1) a

10 discretionary permit requirement for outdoor (non-transplant) cultivation located within 1,000

11
1001d puz qeans edeonuy 1021 d'TT'NJIHHOS HAHaVA LIVAH NINISNMONI feet of a URL or VRL; (2) smaller lot sizes with the approval of a discretionary permit; and, (3)
LLLZ-1 12 direction to staff to evaluate and bring to the Commission for review and recommendation to the
5 VO LHEQJEE BIUES 13 Board as to "special areas" within the County where hemp cultivation should be "excluded"

14

Thereafter, County staff worked to incorporate the Planning Commission's ("Exclusion Area").

15 66.

16 recommendations into the draft permanent ordinance, while honoring public input, the ALAB
17 subcommittee's work, and the Planning Commission's recommendation.
At its May 5, 2020 meeting, County staff presented draft permanent ordinance 18 67.

19 to the Board that purportedly addressed the Planning Commission's recommendations. The draft

20 permanent ordinance had been amended to include a minor use permit for outdoor (non-

21 transplant) cultivation within 300 and 1,000 feet of a URL or VRL, and a minor use permit to

22 modify the 10 acre minimum parcel size for outdoor cultivation. In other words, the Planning

23 Commission proposed reducing restrictions on the places where hemp could be grown with

24 additional permitting (providing a path for lots smaller than 10 acres and setbacks from a URL or

25 VRL as small as 300 feet to potentially grow hemp). The draft permanent ordinance also
maintained that setbacks be measured from the nearest alleged sensitive use, rather than the 26

27 hemp cultivator's property line, and only prohibited outdoor hemp cultivation within 300 feet of

28 certain alleged sensitive uses.

1 68. With respect to the Exclusion Area recommendation, the staff report noted the

2 following:

3 This topic was a frequent point of discussion in public comment prior to, and at, the Planning Commission hearing. Specifically, 4 members of the public and the wine industry spoke about Edna Valley and the possibility for conflict between industrial hemp 5 cultivation, the residential community, and the existing wine
6 industry. The topic of terpene taint was also discussed. Terpenes are volatile organic compounds that can possess a strong odor and can
7 evaporate from plant oils where they are present and be released into the air. It is important to note that there is a lack of scientific research regarding the effects of hemp terpenes on 8 wine grapes, although that is likely to change in the near future as research is underway. The case was made by some members of 9 the wine industry that the unique geography of the Edna Valley makes the wine industry there especially vulnerable to hemp odors.
The Commission did not provide direction as to which specific
10014 puz '103.1 1021 Anacapa LLVAH NIAISNMORH MagxV; SCHRECK, LLP 10 11 characteristics should be considered in defining exclusion areas. L1L7-101€6 VD 'BURQIEg Santa 12 Staff recognizes that identifying areas for exclusion based on unique geographic features a presents a challenge due to the many
13 micro-climates with unique geography within the county. The Planning Commission also discussed American Viticultural Areas ("AVAs") and whether to not allow hemp within a defined AVA. 14 AVAs are distinguished by specific geographic or climatic features that distinguish them from surrounding regions and affect how 15 grapes are grown. San Luis Obispo County has major AVAs. which include an additional 11 sub-areas within the Paso Robles 16 AVA. Commissioner Multari pointed out that in the case of the Edna Valley AVA, the boundaries cross into the City of San Luis 17 Obispo. The Commission did not suggest that AVAs should be the delineation for exclusion areas. Instead the Commission highlighted 18 the criteria for exclusion areas for discussion by the Board and requested the Board direct staff as to whether exclusion areas 19 should be pursued.

20 (Staff Report, p. 6 [emphasis added].) In response to Exclusion Area recommendation, the

21 County staff report included two alternatives for the Board's considerationrequiring a

22 discretionary permit for all outdoor (non-transplant) hemp cultivation within one-mile of a URL

23 or VRL, or prohibiting outdoor (non-transplant) hemp cultivation within a certain distance from

24 URLs and VRLs. The staff report noted that this second alternative is "one way of establishing

25 exclusion zones based around proximity to URLs and VRLs within the County."

26 69. Despite these alternatives, County staff recommended the Board adopt the draft

27 permanent ordinance as presented to the Board. Attached hereto as Exhibits H is a true and

28 correct copy of the County staff report on the draft permanent ordinance, which includes, among
21
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 other things, copies of the Planning Commission staff report, the Planning Commission's action,

2 and the draft permanent ordinances presented to the Board.

3 70. In addition to recommending adoption of the proposed draft permanent

4 ordinance, the staff report recommended the County find the proposed draft permanent ordinance

5 exempt from CEQA review, citing CEQA Guideline section 15016(b)(3). The staff report stated,

6 without citing any evidence, that that the Environmental Coordinator determined "it can be seen

7 with certainty that there is no possibility that the proposed project may have a significance

8 adverse effect on the environment.'

9 71. On information and belief, on May 4, 2020, the Assistant Agricultural
Commissioner for the County sent an email to "Interested Hemp Growers" concerning County

J001d puz soans edeoeuy BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 10

11 staff's report on the draft permanent ordinance. The Assistant Agricultural Commissioner had 1ILZ-LO1€6 VO 'RIRQIEA BIURS 12 been a key participant in the ALAB, Planning Commission, and Board processes associated with

13 the development of the Urgency Moratorium and the permanent ordinance and was regularly
14 communicating updates to interested stakeholders, including a number of members of the

15 Coalition. The email notified the stakeholders of the upcoming Board meeting and flagged the

16 changes made to the draft permanent ordinance by County staff:

17 Last Wednesday, I sent you information and links to numerous
18 documents regarding the Board of Supervisors meeting to be held tomorrow on industrial hemp cultivation. For those of you who

19 have been following this process closely over the past year, I wanted to point out one of the changes in the proposed ordinance going to the Board tomorrow compared to the 20 version that went to the Planning Commission on January 23, 2020. A section has been added based on a recommendation from 21 the Planning Commission that would require a Minor Use Permit for all flowering outdoor hemp cultivation within 300-1,000 feet of 22 an Urban Reserve Line (URL) or a Village Reserve Line (VRL) (Section 22.30.344.B.2). This 1S more restrictive than the previous 23 ordinance versions so I just wanted to point that out to all of our interested growers since it could impact certain growers depending 24 on where their current or planned cultivation site is located. For
25 most growers, I am guessing that the requirement of obtaining a Minor Use Permit through the County Planning department would
26 be cost prohibitive for a hemp grower, so this section would definitely impact those growers near a URL or VRL. There's a very
27 basic map showing the various URLs and VRLs in the county on page 14 of Planning's Power Point Presentation slated for
tomorrow: 28 https://agcnda.slocounty.ca.gov/iip/sanluisobispo/file/getfile/12190

2 Additionally, in the Planning Department's letter to the Board (https://agenda.slocounty.ca.gov/iip/sanluisobispo/file/getfile/12052 3 7) there is a discussion about the possibility of requiring a Minor Use Permit at even further distances from a URL or VRL (up to a 4 mile). This is not a recommendation and it is not included in the proposed ordinance, but it is mentioned by Planning as a potential 5 alternative option. Numerous potential hemp cultivation sites would be impacted if this more stringent option was considered by the 6 Board of Supervisors.

7 I thought you all would want to be made aware of those issues. Please let me know if you have any questions, 8 (Emphasis added.)

72. After receiving staff's presentation at its May 5, 2020 meeting, several of the
10 Supervisors asked County Counsel whether the Board could make changes to the draft
1001d puz $anS edeonuy IZOI LIVAH NIMISNMOHA JTT 'XOIHHOS MIRAVA 11
TILZ-IOTEG VO BIBQIEE BIUBS permanent ordinance without further Planning Commission review. County Counsel claimed
12 that the Board could amend the draft permanent ordinance within the confines of the Planning
13 Commission's discussion and recommendations. However, County Counsel admitted that,
14 pursuant to the State Planning and Zoning Law, the draft permanent ordinance could not be
15 modified to include items not discussed or recommended by the Planning Commission. County
16 Counsel identified the creation of Exclusion Areas (other than in Edna Valley Exclusion Area) as
17
one type of modification that the Board could not make to the draft permanent ordinance, as the
18 Planning Commission had not reviewed and discussed such items. Once this discussion
19 concluded, the Board opened the hearing for public comment.
20
73. At the conclusion of the public comment period, the Board's discussion of the
21 draft permanent ordinance continued, with it immediately becoming apparent that the Board
22 intended to develop an entirely different permanent ordinance.

74. Several of the Supervisors raised unsubstantiated concerns about how the
24 proposed permanent ordinance would address odor, pesticide drift, and terpene taint with
25 adjacent crops. There was no evidence presented or in the record that supported creating an
26 entirely different permanent ordinance to address these "concerns." Indeed, these
27 unsubstantiated concerns had been addressed and resolved through the development of the draft
28
23
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 permanent ordinance by the ALAB subcommittee, County staff, and the Planning Commission.
2 In fact, the Agricultural Commissioner remarked that no odor complaints had been received

3 about the sixteen commercial growers that cultivated hemp in 2019; and that all of the

4 complaints that had been received pertained to only a few of the research cultivators. Similarly,

5 Supervisor Gibson, who opposed modifying the draft permanent ordinance, pointed out that any

6 odor concerns with outdoor cultivation in the Rural Residential land use category were

7 unfounded as the draft ordinance only permitted outdoor transplant cultivation in that land use

8 category, meaning there would be no odor impacts from such cultivation.

9 75. Similarly, Supervisor Gibson ensured his colleagues that any concerns with
LIVAH NIAISNMONA d'TT'XOTHHOS HAAHVA 10 pesticide drift were baseless as pesticide drift is illegal-i.e., imposing setbacks due to pesticide

1021 Anacapa Street, 2nd Floor 11
I1LZ-I0IE6 drift is absurd, as it requires a property owner to mitigate illegal actions taken by its neighbor.
12 He also remarked that terpene taint-the idea that certain organic compounds released by hemp
8 13
'RIeqITg vuTS will taint nearby wine grapes---has been found to be negligible with a setback of less than a 100

14 feet.

15 76. Finally, mirroring ALAB's comments from the summer of 2019, Supervisor
16 Gibson cautioned that using odor complaints as a basis to regulate hemp, a legal crop, could set
17 precedent for regulating other legal crops, like broccoli. Supervisor Gibson also mentioned that

18 other counties, like Sonoma County, had taken much less restrictive measures to regulate hemp,
19 such as imposing a 600 feet setback from residential uses that could be modified through
20 agreement by the parties.

21 77. Ignoring these responses, the majority of the Board crafted a significantly
22 modified permanent hemp ordinance at the dais, without public comment, without any evidence
23 supporting the modifications, and without the required report and recommendation and land use

24 consistency analysis from the Planning Commission. A few of the substantial changes are

1 78. The Board did not act with any evidence when making these changes. For
2 example, when the County staff was asked to justify implementing the Edna Valley Exclusion

3 Area, County staff responded by stating the Valley has unique topographical features. However,

4 when pressed, staff could offer no reasonable explanation as to how those topographical features

5 warranted prohibiting cultivation in the Edna Valley. Neither could any of the Board members.

6 Similarly, when the Board members were asked to justify these changes, the Board members
7 proposing the changes could provide no reasonable rationale.

8 79. County staff conducted no further environmental analysis, no further General

Q Plan consistency analysis, and no further fact finding to support the modifications to the draft

10 permanent ordinance or to understand the environmental and policy impacts created by the

11 Board's modifications to the ordinance. 4001H puz qans cdeobuy 1021 JTT'XOTHHOS Tagava HYATT NITISNMOHA CILZ-TOTE6 VO 'EIBqIEg 12 80. When Supervisor Gibson commented that these modifications would amount to a

13 de facto ban of hemp cultivation, opposing Supervisors simply argued that it did not, providing

14 no evidence to support that conclusion.

15 81. In short, staff and the Board failed to consider the practical, policy, or
any manner, and ignored the significant 16 environmental implications of the modifications in

17 amount of input from their constituents. The Board arbitrarily and completely redrafted the

18 proposed permanent ordinance after all public comment had concluded and without staff or

19 Planning Commission review or analysis, and adopted the Hemp Prohibition and findings

20 supporting the Hemp Prohibition. The Hemp Prohibition becomes effective on June 4, 2020.

21 82. The Board also found the Hemp Prohibition exempt from CEQA review without

22 any analysis of the proposed environmental impacts of the Hemp Prohibition. The Board acted

23 without any evidence supporting its action and without understanding the actual implications of
24 the restrictions it adopted. The Board did not understand the basic facts, such as the number of

25 parcels that the Hemp Prohibition would exclude from potential hemp cultivation.

26 83. The Board also did not give the Planning Commission, the public or stakeholders

27 an opportunity to consider the potential impacts of the Board's proposed actions and provide

28 comments and evidence to the Board regarding their concerns. This is a foundational principal
26
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1

2 of the County's land use ordinance, as it is a foundational principal of most rulemaking--the

3 opportunity for stakeholders and the public to receive notice and an opportunity to comment on a
proposed change in regulation.

4 84.

5 The Board began the process of regulating hemp by telling staff that it did not

6 want to adopt a ban on hemp cultivation. The County then spent months conducting a public

7 process to formulate a carefully negotiated ordinance. In spite of that process, Supervisors

8 closed the public hearing and significantly modified the ordinance with provisions that are a de

9 facto ban because they will prohibit hemp cultivation on most parcels in the County and render

LLVAH NIZISNMOHg FARBE dTI 'NJTHHOS cultivation on the remaining parcels economically infeasible.

10 85.

11 The Board's actions in adopting the Hemp Prohibition violate numerous laws,

Barbara, CA 93101-2711 10011 puz taans edEOeuy IZOl 12 and disregard the significant efforts by their constituents to build consensus around the draft
permanent ordinance.

13 86.

14 On information and belief, after the Board adjourned the meeting on May 5,

15 2020, the Assistant Agricultural Commissioner for the County, a County employee, sent an email
to the County's contact list of hemp growers. The email stated as follows:

16 Interested Hemp Growers,

17

18 It's been a long day, and it's going to take some time to fully digest what the Board of Supervisors' enacted today. I'll be sitting down in

19 the coming days to try and figure out what all of this means.

20 For now, suffice it to say, that the Board made serious, serious changes to the proposed permanent hemp ordinance and added

21 major restrictions. In my estimation, their decision will essentially act as: prohibition because I don't think there are very

22 many sites that exist in the county that can possibly meet all of the requirements that they approved. In summary, the major changes

23 that they made include (1) changing the proposed minimum parcel size from 10 acres to 400 acres, (2) increasing the setbacks all the

24 way up to 2,000 feet from the property line (instead of from a sensitive receptor), which means that even a 400 acre parcel may

25 not be enough. (3) They also excluded cultivation of hemp in the Edna Valley, and (4) banned growing hemp in hoop houses.

26 Again, these were major, major changes which we certainly

27 were not expected, and will essentially act as a prohibition. The one exception to that is that transplants will be allowed, but we will

28 have to wait to see a finalized version of the ordinance to be sure
about any potential restrictions on transplants as well. Our Department had some issues with the proposed ordinance, but 27
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 we thought that it was a reasonable approach and represented some compromises that would enable industrial hemp 2 cultivation to get a foothold in San Luis Obispo County. We
U have enjoyed working with the growers that were able to get registered and were fully prepared to work with additional growers on the registration process if the ordinance was passed as proposed. 4 Unfortunately, the decision that the Board made today will make it extremely difficult for anyone to cultivate hemp in San 5 Luis Obispo County.

6 I will send additional updates in the coming days.

7 (Emphasis added.)

8 87. The Coalition and its members participated in the County's hemp regulatory

unnecessary, 9 process at every turn. They opposed the Urgency Moratorium, showing that it was
d'TT'XOAHHOS NUAHVA LLVAH NITISNMOHA 10 unsupported by any evidence, and based on numerous violations of the law. They participated in

11 the ALAB hemp subcommittee, providing input and solutions as to how the draft permanent ILLZ-I0IE6 VD 'RRQIPA BIURS 30012 puz saans edeseny IZOl 12 ordinance could address all stakeholder viewpoints. They met with County staff to discuss the

13 draft permanent ordinance. They submitted written and oral comments at the Planning

14 Commission hearing on the draft permanent ordinance. And they provided further written and
adopted the Hemp Prohibition. These 15 oral comments at the meeting in which the Board

16 comments raised the issues and claims alleged herein.

17 88. All of these comments were ignored by the Board; and the time and effort

18 expended by the Coalition in participating in the draft permanent ordinance process was rendered

19 wasted time by the Board's adoption of the Hemp Prohibition. Because the Board failed to

20 receive input on the Hemp Prohibition from the Coalition, the public, the Planning Commission,

21 and County staff, the Board could not know the practical ramifications of the Hemp Prohibition

22 when it was adopted.

23 89. As an example, the Board failed to consider how many parcels, including those

24 planted with hemp in 2019, could satisfy the 400 minimum parcel size requirements for outdoor

25 cultivation. And the Board failed to consider how its 2,000 feet property line setback would
parcel size requirements. This is particularly 26 impact any parcels that could meet the minimum

27 evident as imposing 2,000 feet setback on a square 400 acre parcel leaves the property owner

28 with 30,349.12 square feet, or 0.7 acres, to cultivate hemp. The grower, in other words, would
28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

be limited to growing hemp on 0.175% of the property. These undue restrictions eliminate the

2 vast majority of the properties within the County for outdoor hemp cultivation.

3 90. Similarly, the Board failed to analyze its prohibition on indoor hemp cultivation

4 (non-transplant) in the Rural Residential land use category. Indeed, on information and belief,

5 there are millions of square feet of vacant greenhouses within the County in areas designated

6 Rural Residential. These greenhouses formerly housed vibrant agricultural businesses, which
7 have been decimated due to shifts in the market. They are prime areas for hemp cultivation,

8 however, the Hemp Prohibition prevents non-transplant farming. Accordingly, these millions of

9 square feet of greenhouses will face pressures to convert to other viable uses, like residential or

10 commercial.

11 91. Furthermore, the Board failed to consider how many parcels would immediately 10012 puz qaang Edeouy d'TT*NDNHHOS HAHHVA LIVAH NIZLSNMONH Santa Barbara, CA 93101-2711 12 be eliminated from consideration for outdoor hemp cultivation by the Hemp Prohibition's one-
13 mile setback from URLs and VRLs, which the County staff report acknowledges acts as an

14 Exclusion Area. At the time of the Board hearing, the County staff and Planning Commission

15 had only analyzed and recommended a 1,000 feet setback from URLs or VRLs for outdoor (non-
transplant) hemp cultivation, and the setback could be modified by a minor use permit. The 16

17 Planning Commission noted that any Exclusion Area would require additional Planning

18 Commission review and recommendation; they had never considered the impacts or the General

19 Plan consistency of such a policy. Despite these warnings, as well as the warnings from County
20 Counsel that adopting an Exclusion Area other than in the Edna Valley would violate State
21 Planning and Zoning Law, the Board adopted the one-mile setback Exclusion Area.

22 92. The Board also failed to base its ban of hemp cultivation in hoop houses in any
23 reasoning or evidence. Hoop houses are an allowed accessory and equipment for all other crop
24 production in the County, providing crucial shelter for the crops, buffering the crops from the
25 impacts of climate change, and extending the growing season. They also increase efficiency by

26 reducing water demand, raising crop yield and quality, and leading to higher outputs on smaller

27 acreages. Members of the Coalition spent time and money purchasing and constructing these
28 hoop houses on their properties to cultivate hemp. The Board's action to ban this tried and true
29

2 farming technique rendered all of this time and expense wasted, and was made arbitrarily.

3 Indeed, the banning of hemp cultivation in hoop houses will only increase any alleged odor and

4 pesticide drift issues, as well as the water and land required to generate an economically viable
agricultural product.

6 The Coalition's members, whose businesses and lives have been thrown into

7 disarray by the Hemp Prohibition, understand the impacts of the Board's action; the Board does

not.

25 CEQA Guidelines section 15378 defines a "project" subject to CEQA as "the

27 environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment, and that

28 is," among other things, "an activity directly undertaken by any public agency including
enactment and amendment of zoning ordinances ..

2 CEQA includes a "common a sense" exemption "[w]here it can be seen with certainty that there is

3 no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the environment."

4 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15061(b)(3) [emphasis added].) The California Supreme Court recently
summarized this standard:

5

6 [A] proposed activity is a CEQA project if, by its general nature, the activity is capable of causing a direct or reasonably foresecable

7 indirect physical change in the environment. This determination is made without considering whether, under the specific

8 circumstances in which the proposed activity will be carried out, these potential effects will actually occur. Consistent with this

9 standard, a "reasonably foreseeable" indirect physical change is one that the activity is capable, at least in theory, of causing.

d'TIMOTHHOS MUSHVA LIVAH NIAISNMOMg 10 (Guidelines, § 15064, subd. (d)(3).) Conversely, an indirect effect is not reasonably foresecable if there is no causal connection between

THEQIRE BIUES ÇA 93101-2711 1021 Anacapa J001d puz qans 11 the proposed activity and the suggested environmental change or if the postulated causal mechanism connecting the activity and the

12 effect is so attenuated as to be "speculative."

13 (Union of Medical Marijuana Patients, Inc. V. City of San Diego (2019) 7 Cal.5th 1171, 1197.)

100.

14 The County's determination that its approval of the Hemp Prohibition is not

15 subject to CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15061(b)(3) flies in the face of CEQA's

16 principles. Indeed, CEQA is construed "to afford the fullest possible protection to the

17 environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language." (Union of Medical

18 Marijuana Patients, supra, 7 Cal.5th at 1184.) The County's action in adopting the Hemp

19 Prohibition without environmental review ignores this policy and CEQA's statutory

20 requirements. The County abused its discretion; it did not proceed in the manner required by

21 law, failed to make required findings, and failed to support its determination with any evidence.

101.

22 Most significantly, it is clear that the Hemp Prohibition may result in significant

23 environmental effects. As discussed above, hemp is an environmentally superior crop. It

24 reduces water and pesticide use; it regenerates the soil and reduces the carbon in our atmosphere;

25 and it creates a new means for the agriculture industry to diversify production in the County with

26 a low water demand crop. The Hemp Prohibition will significantly reduce the agriculture

27 industry's ability to capitalize on these benefits. The inability to cultivate hemp within the

28 County will necessarily increase water consumption, pesticide use, and the amount of carbon in
the atmosphere, while degrading the quality of the soil within the County.
31
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 102.

2 For example, in November 2019, the County established an "applied water"

3 factor for hemp of 1.5 acre feet per acre per year ("AFAY") in certain areas of the County.

4 (County Code, § 22.30.204.) The County had previously established the following applied water

5 factors for other crops: (1) 4.5 AFAY for alfalfa; (2) 2.3 AFAY for citrus; (3) 3.5 AFAY for

6 deciduous; (4) 2.3 AFAY for strawberries; (5) 2.5 AFAY for nursery; (6) 4.8 AFAY for pasture;

7 (7) 1.9 AFAY for vegetables; and, (8) 1.2 AFAY for vineyard. In other words, the County has

8 deemed hemp as the most water efficient crop other than vineyards, which require a substantial

9 amount of additional water not considered in this applied water factor to process their grapes into

BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 10 wine. Farmers' inability to capitalize on hemp's water savings will necessarily increase water
use throughout the County.

11
ITAZ-10IE6 VD 'WJEqIBH Santa 1021 Anacapa Street, 2nd Floor 103.

12 The Hemp Prohibition's additional restrictions on the agriculture industry also

13 threaten the industry's ongoing economic viability. With these additional restrictions, it is

14 reasonably foreseeable that additional agriculture land will be converted to residential and
commercial uses, promoting urban sprawl.

15 Such conversion can lead to innumerable

16 environmental impacts, from increased greenhouse gas emissions, air quality impacts,

17 transportation impacts, land use inconsistencies contrary to policies discouraging urban sprawl,
growth inducement, and inefficient uses of energy.

18 104.

19 For example, the Hemp Prohibition bans indoor hemp cultivation for flowering

20 plants in Rural Residential areas. All of the County's greenhouses in this area will thus be

21 pressured to either grow only transplant hemp, or to engage in another economically viable

22 activity. The greenhouses in the Rural Residential areas have already faced extreme pressure

23 from foreign agricultural markets, with many of the greenhouses now vacant. As a result, these

24 greenhouses may pursue non-agricultural activities to become economically viable, which, as

25 noted above, could create innumerable environmental impacts. However, if the greenhouses

26 choose to cultivate transplant hemp, the greenhouses will need to transport the flowering hemp to

27 other areas in the County or outside the County. This transportation may generate greenhouse

28 gas, air quality, and transportation impacts that the County has not analyzed.

32

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 105. A similar analysis applies to the ban on hoop houses. By preventing such

2 cultivation practices, farmers may be required to increase water use and land cover to harvest an

3 economically viable crop, which may generate environmental impacts that the County has not

4 analyzed.

5 106. Furthermore, the Hemp Prohibition directly contradicts the General Plan's

6 policies regarding the preservation of agricultural resources discussed above, and renders the

7 Right to Farm Ordinance superfluous as it deems certain agriculture a public nuisance due to its

8 proximity to residential uses, the exact result the Right to Farm Ordinance sought to prevent.

9 These inconsistencies create significant land use impacts.
d'TT'XJAMHOS aHaäV; I.IVAH NIZLSNMONg 10 107. The County, did not take the time to understand the environmental, economic,

11 and policy implications of the significant modifications the Board proposed to the ordinance TTAZ-IOTE6 VO 'EIRQIE Santa 10014 puz q3anS BdROzuy tZor 12 after the close of the public hearing. The County did not understand how many parcels and how

13 much acreage would now be prohibited from cultivating hemp, or if the regulations imposed in

14 the Hemp Prohibition would render cultivation on the remaining parcels economically infeasible.

15 County staff and the Planning Commission did not provide any review or analysis of the Hemp

16 Prohibition. For these reasons, it is impossible for the County to support its findings that the

17 Hemp Prohibition is not subject to CEQA and is not capable of a causing a direct or reasonably

18 foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment. There is no evidence to support the

19 finding because no analysis was done. The Hemp Prohibition will have a significant effect on

20 the environment. Accordingly, the County improperly determined that the Hemp Prohibition is

21 not subject to CEQA.

22 108. The County's improper determination that the Hemp Probibition is not subject to

23 the provisions of CEQA constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and, as such, the adoption of

24 the Hemp Prohibition should be set aside.

13 Most egregiously, the County's actions in adopting the Hemp Prohibition violate

14 the State Planning and Zoning Law, the County's General Plan, and the County's zoning

ordinance.

15 113.

16 Pursuant to Government Code section 65853, the Hemp Prohibition was required

17 to be adopted in accordance with Government Code sections 65854 to 65857. Government Code

18 section 65855 requires the Planning Commission to provide the Board with a recommendation as

19 to any proposed zoning ordinance, including whether the ordinance is consistent with the

20 applicable general plan. Once the Board receives the Planning Commission's recommendation,

the Board

21 may "approve, modify or disapprove the recommendation provided that any

22 modification of the proposed ordinance or amendment by the [Board] not previously considered

23 by the planning commission during its hearing, shall first be referred to the planning commission

24 for report and recommendation." (Gov. Code, § 65857.) The County's zoning ordinance
includes an identical requirement. (County Code, § 22.70.040.)

25 114.

26 The Board's actions in adopting the Hemp Prohibition violate each of these

27 requirements. The Board adopted the Hemp Prohibition, which significantly deviated from the

28 draft permanent ordinance, without referring the Hemp Prohibition to the Planning Commission.
This is especially significant as the Planning Commission had never reviewed, a proposed hemp

12 Moreover, Government Code section 65860 requires the County's zoning

13 ordinances to be "compatible with the objectives, policies, general land uses, and programs"

Probibition.

14 specified in the General Plan. The Board also violated this state law in its adoption of the Hemp

15 For example, the Hemp Prohibition runs afoul of each of the General Plan

16 Agriculture Element's goals and policies discussed above. (See Para. 35, supra.) The Hemp

17 Prohibition reduces the range of agricultural uses permitted within the County, adopts policies

18 that hinder agriculture's long-term viability, encourages the conversion of agricultural land to

19 non-agricultural land, discourages public participation in the land use process, and reduces the

20 feasibility of small-scale agriculture. The Board even ignored its own policies for imposing

21 buffers on agricultural lands, which recommend, at maximum, a 600 foot buffer on intensive

22 agricultural uses. (See County General Plan Agriculture Element, Appendix C, Agricultural

23 Buffer Policies.) As a result of these inconsistencies, the County could not support with any

24 evidence a finding that the Hemp Prohibition is consistent with the General Plan.

116.

25 Furthermore, Government Code section 65852 requires all zoning ordinances to

26 uniformly treat "each class or kind of building or use of land throughout each zone." The Hemp

27 Prohibition also violates this requirement as it categorizes hemp cultivation as a "Crop

28 Production and Grazing" land use, but imposes severe restrictions on hemp cultivation that are
not imposed on other Crop Production and Grazing.

1 Violation of Right to Farm Act and the Right to Farm Ordinance

2 117. The County's Hemp Prohibition also directly contradicts the Right to Farm Act

3 and the County's Right to Farm Ordinance. The policy behind both laws is rooted in the belief

4 that agriculture activities shall not be deemed a nuisance due to a proximity to residences. The

5 policy recognizes that at certain times agricultural operations may result in smell or noise or

express 6 other phenomena that could be experienced as a nuisance by nearby residents. The

7 purpose of both laws is to prevent agricultural operators from being forced to curtail or modify

8 their commercial operations due to nuisance concerns of neighboring residences. The Hemp

9 Prohibition completely ignores these laws and declares hemp cultivation in violation of the
BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 10 Hemp Prohibition a nuisance, regardless of the manner in which the hemp is cultivated, how

11
ETLZ-IOLE6 VO 'BBqIEE Santa 100ld puz seans edeasay IZOI long agricultural operations have taken place on the property, and any changed circumstances.

12 This direct violation of the Right to Farm Act and the County's Right to Farm Ordinance renders

13 the Hemp Prohibition arbitrary and capricious.

14 Lack of Evidence and Arbitrary and Capricious Decision Making

15 118. Finally, the County acted entirely arbitrary in its adoption of the Hemp

16 Prohibition. There is no evidence supporting any of the modifications the Board made to the
17 draft permanent ordinance.

18 119. For example, there is no evidence that increasing the minimum parcel size for

19 outdoor cultivation to 400 acres or prohibiting cultivation within hoop houses would reduce any

20 alleged odor impacts, or claimed terpene taint. Rather, the modification only served to impose a

21 de facto ban on hemp cultivation within the County.

22 120. Similarly, the County cannot support the need for the one-mile setback around
URLs and VRLs, and the 2,000 feet setback from property lines with any evidence. As the 23

24 Agricultural Commissioner commented at the May 5, 2020 meeting, no commercial hemp

25 cultivation sites had received odor complaints in 2019, and yet the Hemp Prohibition arbitrarily

26 applies to all of these farms. Further, any claimed odor impacts of hemp cultivation are the

27 product of complex interactions between topography, vegetation and other buffers, the weather,

28 and the population. There is no evidence that these setbacks will prevent such interactions. This
36
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 is especially true of the Board's changes to impose these undue setbacks on transplant

2 cultivation-which the County has acknowledged does not create odor impacts. A comparison

3 highlights the absurdity of the one mile setback-the Department of Toxic Substances Control
adopted a time-limited one-quarter mile buffer for certain pesticide applications near a 4

5 schoolsite, a much more serious potential threat. (See Code Regs., tit. 3, § 6691.)

6 121. Furthermore, the staff report for the May 5, 2020 meeting expressly indicated

7 that there is no scientific evidence to support any claimed setbacks for terpene taint. As

8 Supervisor Gibson mentioned at the May 5, 2020 hearing, terpene taint has been proven

9 negligible at distances of 100 feet.

10 122. Furthermore, the Hemp Prohibition is arbitrary and capricious in that it is
2001d puz faans Anecapa IZOI BROWNSTEIN HYATT d'TT'XOnaNOS aaaava 11 premature. On information and belief, California submitted its state plan to the Secretary of ITL7-101€6 VD 'erEqIRg BIaBS 12 Agriculture for review and approval pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill on or before May 1, 2020.

13 The state plan will regulate hemp cultivation throughout the entirety of the State. As such, any

14 regulation by the County in the interim period before the Secretary of Agriculture issues a

15 determination on the state plan is premature, as the state plan will govern the County's future

16 hemp regulation.

17 123. Similarly, the Hemp Prohibition's mandate that hemp be subject to the same

18 "violations" regulations as cannabis is without evidence and in violation of the law.

19 124. The County's adoption of the Hemp Prohibition without any evidence supporting
20 the ordinance and in violation of these laws constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and, as

21 such, the adoption of the Hemp Prohibition should be set aside.

22 125. The Coalition, its members, and the general public have suffered and will suffer

23 irreparable harm if the relief requested is not granted. The Coalition, its members, and the

24 general public have been prejudiced by the County's adoption of the Hemp Prohibition and, as

25 such, the Hemp Prohibition should be set aside and remanded for reconsideration consistent with

26 the court's ruling on this action.

2 The Coalition seeks and is entitled to a declaration that the Hemp Prohibition
violates these applicable laws and, as such, is in invalid, and/or may be applied in an arbitrary

manner.

5 The requested declarations are necessary and appropriate at this time sO that the

6 Coalition, its members and the general public will not be deprived of their right to farm under

Abstract: Hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) is an emerging high-value specialty crop that can be cultivated for either fiber, seed, or cannabidiol (CBD). The demand for hemp and its products has been consistently on the rise in the 21st century. The United States of America (USA) has reintroduced hemp and legalized its production as an agricultural commodity through the 2018 Federal Farm Bill. Although there is a renewed interest in the adoption of hemp due to the emerging market, its production in the United States (US) remains limited partly because of unclear agronomic guidance and fertilization recommendations. This review article provides information on the current agronomic management practices that are available in the literature and identifies the future research needs for cultivating this
multipurpose crop to address the growing market demands. Hemp production could be beneficial if managed properly. Hemp fertilizer requirements vary in accordance with the type of hemp grown (seed, fiber, or CBD), soil, environmental conditions and requires a wide range of macro- and micronutrients. Integrating management practices in hemp cultivation intended to build soil health is
promising since the hemp cropping system is suitable for crop rotation, cover cropping, and livestock integration through animal waste applications. Hemp also has significant environmental benefits since it has the potential to remediate contaminated soils through phytoremediation, convert high amounts of atmospheric CO2 to biomass through bio-sequestration, and hemp biomass for bioenergy production. This review identifies that most of the agronomic research in the past has been limited to hemp fiber and, to some extent, hemp seed but not CBD hemp. With the increase in the global markets for hemp products, more research needs to be conducted to provide agronomic guidelines for sustainable hemp production.
Keywords: Cannabis; hemp CBD; hemp fiber; hemp oilseed; soil health for hemp; agronomic management practices

1. Introduction

Industrial hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) or hemp production has recently been the subject of increasing interest around the world, especially in the United States. Hemp is not only a crop that is among many possible agricultural products that could supplement or replace fiber or paper, but it is also a crop with environmental benefits and a potentially profitable crop that fits into sustainable farming systems [1]. Hemp is one of is the world's oldest cultivated plants that was developed from wild Cannabis plants that originated most probably in Central Asia over 3000 years ago [2]. It is a multipurpose crop that could also be grown for its seed, oil, food, and medicinal properties. Hemp is a dioecious annual wind-pollinated crop with separate male and female plants, and occasionally monoccious. It is also a short-day and photoperiod sensitive crop. Differences in growth rate and development between male and female plants are typically evident since the male plants tend to flower and senesce earlier [3].

Marijuana and hemp belong to the same plant species (i.e., Cannabis sativa). However, hemp is genetically different and also distinguished by its use and chemical makeup. More than 100 different chemical compounds called cannabinoids can be extracted from hemp. Two major cannabinoids are tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). Hemp contains THC of 0.3% or less, while marijuana can contain up to 20% THC, as its primary psychoactive chemical. Certain varieties of hemp have higher levels of CBD, the non-psychoactive part, has medicinal properties [4]. A high ratio of CBD to THC would make hemp very relevant as a medical treatment for ailments, but opinions remain mixed about how CBD levels might influence the psychoactive effects of THC [4]. The interest in hemp and its benefits has spurred since significant changes in the legalization of hemp in the USA [5]. For decades, federal law did not differentiate hemp from other Cannabis plants. Cannabis of any kind was made illegal and hemp was classified as a Schedule I Controlled substance according to the Controlled Substance Act of 1970. There was no large-scale industrial production in the US, and the US market was mainly dependent on imports both as finished hemp products and as ingredients for use in further processing [4]. The USA was the biggest importer of hemp products [4], obtaining most of its seed and fiber from Canada and China, respectively. In 2014, the United States Congress granted permission through the Farm Bill to run test programs for growing hemp in a number of US states. Since then, 41 states have passed legislation that allows hemp cultivation. The 2018 Farm Bill declassified hemp from the list of controlled substances and legalized the production of hemp as an agricultural commodity [5]. According to the 2018 Farm Bill, hemp that is allowed to be cultivated should have a THC threshold of 0.3%. The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) sternly controls its production and enforces rules governing the conditions under which hemp must be cultivated. Any hemp crop found to have THC levels beyond 0.3% must be disposed of accordingly as it is classified as marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act [6]. Currently, over 30 nations grow hemp as an agricultural crop and sell on the world market. Hemp's global market is predicted to double from the year 2016 to 2020, and at present, the is US is the third-largest producer of hemp. Currently, hemp production is legal in 46 states in the US and it is cultivated for commercial or research purposes in at least 47 countries in the world. In the US, the amount of hemp acreage and licenses has increased rapidly in the last couple of years. Due to an increase in demand for non-food crops and other food derivatives in the agricultural sector, hemp has progressively recovered its importance [7]. Hemp is an unconventional crop with
a broad spectrum of adaptation throughout North America [8]. The diverse range of products that a hemp plant could produce has drawn the attention of a variety of industries. These include agriculture, textile, automotive, construction, bio-fuel, oil, cosmetics, pharmaceutical industry, etc. [9]. Due to this increase in interest in hemp cultivation for multipurpose production, some dual-purpose hemp varieties were also introduced in European countries that yield both fiber and seed [10]. Hemp has the potential to be an environmentally friendly and highly sustainable crop if managed properly [11]. Hemp replenishes the soil and has been proven to remediate contaminated soils [12-14]. Generally, it is considered as a crop that could be grown without any pesticides [15] for certain varieties [16]. Hemp has the potential to suppress weeds efficiently and can fit well in a crop rotation [17]. Additionally, some residues of hemp can be used as botanical insecticides, miticides, or repellants within programs of pest management in organic farming [18]. These properties also make it suitable for integration in an organic farming system. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) policy on organic certification of hemp states "For hemp produced in the United States, only hemp produced in accordance with the US Domestic Hemp Production Program and/or the 2014 Farm Bill may be certified as organic, if produced in accordance with USDA organic regulations" [19]. Hence, the advantages of this crop in agriculture are not exclusively limited to its wide range of products and applications, but also due to its potential to improve soil health that encompasses the plant, environmental, and human health components. The overall aim of this review is to (1) provide the current state of knowledge and agronomic management practices involved in growing hemp for fiber, seed, and CBD, and (2) to identify the research needs to improve sustainable hemp production.

2. Hemp Commercial Utilities and Environmental Benefits
2.1. Multipurpose Hemp Crop and Potential Markets

2.1.1. Hemp Grown for Fiber
Fiber derived from hemp is one of the strongest and durable forms of natural fiber. Hemp grown for fiber is one of the oldest and most widely cultivated varieties of hemp. Back in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, other natural fibers and synthetic fibers competed for hemp's uses as textile
fiber [20]. Currently, hemp has been re-discovered as a sustainable [21], high yielding industrial fiber crop [22] that can help meet the high global demand for fibers. Harvesting for fiber involves mowing (often by a sickle-bar mower), retting in the field, and baling [23]. Hemp fiber is used for textiles, clothing, as biocomposites for automobiles, paper, building materials (hempcrete), animal bedding, and has potential as a bio-fuel crop too [8]. Hemp consists of two types of fibers namely (1) long outer fibers, referred to as bast and (2) the inner short fibers called hurd [24]. For thousands of years, hemp was grown for its bast fiber, while the hurd was regarded as a waste by-product of bast production. Bast fibers can account for 20-30% of the stalk, and superior quality bast fiber is obtained from hemp fields that are densely planted. Hurd fibers, on the other hand, make up 70-80% of the stalk and typically contain 20-30% lignin [25]. Microbial, chemical, or mechanical means are used to separate the fibers from non-fiber components, or the more valuable bast from the hurds [23] However, each type of fiber has its use in the industry. Bast are generally used in the automotive and the paper industry, while hurd is primarily used as a livestock bedding, and other construction applications including fiberboard [26]. Fiber produced by dual-purpose varieties is believed to be of lower quality than that produced by traditional fiber varieties. However, the economic benefits of using the whole plant (i.e., including fiber and seed production) may outweigh this factor. Fiber varieties are typically harvested during flowering but before seed formation to obtain optimal fiber quality [27]. Agronomic management practices and growing conditions such as plant density, nitrogen (N) fertilization, and harvest time are important factors that affect yield and quality of fibers [9,28] and are discussed further in this review.
2.1.2. Hemp Grown for Oilseed or Hemp Oil
For at least 3000 years, hemp seed has been used by both humans and animals directly as a food ingredient or crushed for oil and livestock feed [29]. Hemp seed oil or hemp oil was also used as lighting oil, and for making soap, paints, and varnishes. Studies have been reported on the uses of hemp in food, beverages, and medicinal preparations, or it being used as a bird and fish feed [30]. The soft seed meal produced by hulling differs from the press-cake that remains after the seed oil has been extracted, which also has been referred to as seed meal [26]. Nowadays, hemp seed can be made into flour, just like soy, that contains the right amount of protein for the vegetarian diet. The powder, which is characterized by a nutty flavor, adds a unique culinary and healthy twist to baking. In addition to the nutritional values derived from hemp seed, it has positive health benefits, including reducing cholesterol and high blood pressure [31].
Hemp seed is rich in essential and unsaturated fatty acids, and contains as much protein as soybean. The seeds contain approximately 30% protein which includes eight of the daily essential amino acids recommended for humans, 25% starch, and 30% oil [31]. Hemp seed oil is rich in omega-6 and omega-3 essential fatty acids, and is considered ideal for human health [32,33]. Hemp seed oil contains high quantities of linolenic acid and antioxidants of dietary significance [31]. Oil produced from crushed hemp seed is an ingredient in a large variety of body-care and skin products, e.g., shampoos, soap, cream and hair conditioner, industrial oils, and nutritional supplements. Economic prospects for a hemp oilseed crop in the United States is promising, as the demand for hemp seed products (seed, oil, and press-cake) is steadily increasing [34]. Besides the fact that hemp seed oil has various advantages over other vegetable oils, the present health awareness has made it

Exhibit D - Page 3 of 15

Agriculture 2020, 10, 129 4 of 15

essential to characterize additional vegetable oil sources, e.g., hemp, to be explored as specialty oils. Hence, currently, there is a great deal of focus on the possibility of exploiting this new crop for seed and oil production [35].
2.1.3. Hemp Grown for CBD
Cannabis contains a special class of terpenophenolic compounds-the cannabinoids. CBD, the principal cannabinoid of hemp and a non-psychoactive component extracted from the hemp plant, is one of these compounds. CBD was first extracted from Cannabis in the late 1930s [36] and has ever since been found to have the curative potential for disorders like inflammation and anxiety as well
as potential neuroprotective agent and an antioxidant [36,37]. The other cannabinoid of interest in Cannabis, which is reported to have psychoactive property, is THC. It is the most abundant of over 60 different cannabinoids. Marijuana primarily produces THC, while hemp varieties produce CBD. However, legally, any Cannabis plant with a THC content at or below 0.3% is regarded as hemp, and above this limit is marijuana. Over the years, CBD also has been tested to treat arthritis, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, and pain [38]. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognizes the potential of CBD in the development of therapies but is committed to improving the regulatory pathways for lawful marketing intended to ensure consumer health and safety. The CBD has been reported to alleviate the intoxicant effects of THC but it is highly debatable and still being intensely studied [39].
Hemp varieties grown for CBD are different from the seed or fiber producing varieties. Since CBD is mainly concentrated in female flowers, the plants are often started in greenhouses from propagated female clones and are transplanted two to four weeks after establishment. The use of hemp for generating CBD has not received much consideration as of now, although there is a growing commercial interest in using hemp plants for this purpose [35]. CBD has been an emerging area of interest in the United States since hemp was legalized, and most states have started passing laws that will enable more farmers to produce CBD. Apart from its various health benefits, it is an ideal crop especially for small scale limited resources farmers who are interested in cultivating hemp for CBD. CBD is believed to be much more economical than all other hemp by-products, and its sales are estimated to lead all other hemp-based products by 2022 [40].
Even though there is a knowledge gap in hemp cultivation for CBD, many farmers across the United States are looking to grow CBD hemp. A study published on a recent survey suggested that there is an is interest among farmers to adopt hemp due to the growing market for hemp products mainly CBD [41]. Specifically, this study involved the participation of a total of 245 organic farmers in North Carolina who participated in an online Qualtrics questionnaire to ascertain their knowledge of, and willingness to adopt, hemp cultivation. Findings from this study revealed that a majority of respondents (85%) of North Carolina organic growers are interested in growing hemp on their farms and the majority showed interest in learning more about crop production practices, varieties, and legality associated with growing this crop (Figure 1). Among the respondents, about 52% wanted to grow hemp primarily for medicinal CBD production. More research needs to be conducted to test CBD hemp varieties under different growing conditions to produce higher CBD concentrations while keeping the THC levels below the legal limit of 0.3%. It is expected that this interest will further improve once specific agronomic guidelines for growing CBD hemp has been established.

2.2. Environmental Benefits
2.2.1. Phytoremediation
Hemp is recognized as one of the plants that could be used for land reclamation due to its intense growth specifically for the high yielding fiber varieties [42]. Hemp has been shown to have an intrinsic capacity for phytoremediation, remediating land polluted by heavy metals [43]. The hemp grown for fiber is tall, and its roots grow deep into the soil about 45-90 cm. This enables the plant root to penetrate deep and increase the efficiency of removing widespread contamination as compared to other plants with shallow root system [13]. Hemp has a high potential to absorb and accumulate heavy metals like lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd), etc., through its roots and then store them, thus, making it possible to harvest the hemp plant alongside the hazardous compounds. A wide range of hemp varieties are good candidates for phytoremediation and they have a high tolerance to Cd stress [44]. The same study also found that the highest concentrations of heavy metal accumulations were found in the leaves, although they were distributed in every part of the plant. Leaves of hemp plant collected from a contaminated heavy metal site in Pakistan showed an accumulation of heavy metals; Cu (1530 mg kg-l), Cd (151 mg kg-1), and Ni (123 mg kg-l), respectively [45]. Back in 1986, hemp was planted to help decontaminate the soil around the site where the Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster occurred [13].
2.2.2. Carbon Sequestration
Hemp's fast growth and development makes it one of the fastest sources of CO2-to-biomass converter. Hemp has been proven to be an ideal carbon sink as it can capture more CO2 per hectare than other commercial crops or even forests. For example, one hectare of hemp can absorb 22 tons of CO2 per hectare. High biomass crops like hemp, that are grown for fiber, can sequester higher amounts of carbon by photosynthesis and then store it in the plant's body and roots through bio-sequestration. of Most of the carbon is stored in the harvested hemp stem and less in the roots and leaves. Hemp could produce at least 13 tons of biochar per hectare annually [46]. One of the other potential uses of hemp biomass would be the production of biochar for soil applications that could potentially improve soil carbon sequestration and reduce greenhouse gas emissions [47,48].

2.2.3. Biomass and Bioenergy
Hemp has been recognized as one of the energy plants due to its high biomass and energy concentration per hectare [49]. Weed suppressing abilities, low pesticide requirements, and soil health improvement properties of hemp plants make it even more energy efficient [49,50]. Fuel properties of hemp are either similar or superior to other solid biofuels such as cereal straw, wood, etc. [51]. For example, the heat of combustion of hemp (18.4-19.1 MJ/kg) is comparable to maize Zea mays (18 MJ/kg), slightly greater than Jerusalem artichoke Helianthus tuberosus (16.5 MJ/kg), and slightly less than Miscanthus sp. (19.8 MJ/kg) [50-52]. Additionally, both wet and ensiled hemp biomass can be transformed into biogas and ethanol [49,52]. Hemp also emits comparatively low sulfur compounds [50] and has low ash content [49]. Thus, hemp has the potential to contribute toward renewable energy.
3. Growing Conditions for Hemp Cultivation

3.1. Soil Conditions

Hemp can be grown on several soil types, but it thrives best on loose, well-drained loam soils that are rich in organic matter [53,54]. The most suitable soil for hemp cultivation should have a pH 6.0-7.5 [28] and according to [55], the optimum soil pH for hemp production ranges between 5.8 and 6.0 as it does not grow well in acidic soil. The soil should be deep, well-aerated, rich in nutrients, and have a good water-holding capacity [53]. Sandy loam texture is ideal for hemp growth, followed by clay loam, but heavy clay soil and sandy soil are not very well suitable because they hold too much or too little water [56]. Soil preparation is an essential process in hemp cultivation, and all soil hard pans should be broken to allow free draining as waterlogging kills the plants, especially the young ones. The presence of a compacted layer can restrain root development, particularly when the compaction pan is due to poor soil preparation. Hemp is a tap-rooted crop, and in fine soils, the taproot typically takes on an L-shape, which negatively affects the uptake of nutrients and water by the crop [15]. A study concluded that fertile clay loam or silt loam soils with neutral alkalinity are most suitable for hemp cultivation [57]. Hemp does not germinate well in acid sandy soils, heavy clay, or gravelly soils. Hemp plants could grow in peaty marshlands but will yield lower amounts and quality of fiber [57]. Hemp is very sensitive to soil moisture conditions and should not be subjected to drought. It grows well in soils with high water-holding capacity, and good soil drainage is crucial to maximizing its production since most hemp plants failed to grow in poorly drained soils [58].
3.2. Day Length
Hemp is a short-day plant hence very sensitive to photoperiod. The day length affects the amount of light received by the hemp plant, and has been reported to strongly influence the productivity in different hemp varieties. The shift from the vegetative to flowering stage in hemp is dependent on day length and variety. However, it has been reported that some varieties initiate flowering regardless of day length, while others require shorter days to transition to flower developmental stage [59]. Data on the specific number of light hours required per day are limited and thus require further exploration.
3.3. Plant Spacing
Plant spacing in hemp is dependent on the type of hemp cultivated, i.e., fiber, seed, or CBD. Generally, hemp planted at high density encourages taller height and restricts flowering. Hemp cultivated mainly for fiber are planted closely together in order to promote stalk elongation with reducing branching, attributes that will ensure longer and stronger fiber yield [60]. It also results in the production of high-quality hemp crop because the high-density stands can suppress weeds, thereby eliminating the need for herbicides. On the contrary, hemp planted for seed and CBD are well spaced out to maximize the desired flowering and branching.

Exhibit D - Page 6 of 15

Agriculture 2020, 10, 129 7 of 15

Hemp is typically planted using seed drills with row spacing ranging from 7.6 to 17.8 cm, particularly when it is grown for fiber or seed products. However, seeding rate recommendations vary widely with optimum seeding depth ranging from 1.9 to 3.2 cm. These recommendations ensure minimal competition for the space necessary for vegetative growth and root development [60]. Another study reported the distance between hemp cultivated for fiber to range from 20 to 40 cm [55]. Higher plant populations in fiber varieties of hemp ensure faster canopy closure resulting in minimal weed occurrence [61]. In the case of hemp grown for CBD, the highest yield of flowers or buds was obtained at plant density of 15 plants m-2. It was suggested that the highest hemp oil production from seed yielding varieties would require similar planting density [3]. One of the studies reported row spacing in CBD hemp to be similar to hemp varieties grown for seed [62]. In another study, the optimal density for seed production varied broadly and was found to be between 30 and 75 plants m-2 [63]. The most significant variation was found in hemp cultivated for fiber production, where a study reported that sowing densities ranged from 50 to 750 plants m-2 [64]. A suitable plant spacing to obtain high yields of the stem, seed, and inflorescence altogether was found to be 120 plant m-2, with an inter-row spacing of 0.5 m [65]. Another study reported the optimal density for the cultivation of CBD hemp to be 10 plants m-2 [66]. Results from these studies indicate that optimum hemp spacing is a function of the type of hemp variety grown and soil environmental conditions. However, it is clear that information regarding recommended spacing for optimal CBD and seed hemp production in a wide range of soils and climatic conditions is very limited and needs to be addressed.
3.4. Temperature
Temperature plays a distinct and essential role in hemp production throughout different growth stages. Hemp grows under a wide range of environmental conditions, and a lot of studies have reported that it is more adapted to the temperate climatic zone. Although hemp grows best when the mean daily air temperatures are between 16 and 27 °C, it can also tolerate colder and warmer conditions. For example, at low temperatures of 8-10 °C, the seed takes 8-10 days to germinate. Young seedlings with 8-10 leaves can tolerate some exposure to frost typically up to -5°C. The plant height attained in the field in 90 days can be achieved in 40 days by plants grown at 19 °C in a controlled condition by regulating the growing degree days (GDD). Hemp grown in the Mediterranean requires about 1900-2000 °C GDD for fiber production and about 2700 to 3000 °C GDD for seed production [27]. However, ideal GDD requirements for high yielding CBD hemp need more investigation.
3.5. Rainfall
Hemp requires high moisture throughout its growing season, but most notably during the first
six weeks of growth when the young plants are getting established [57]. After they are well rooted, plants can endure drier conditions, but severe drought can negatively hasten up maturity and cause the production of stunted plants. Ideally, hemp requires a rainfall of 63 to 75 cm per annum. Crop water requirement and uptake varies depending on the type of hemp variety, soil, climatic conditions, and management practices. Hemp roots are capable of penetrating the soil up to 2-3 m to extract moisture, provided the soil is not waterlogged and pans do not impede the plant roots. A study conducted in Europe reported that hemp yield strongly depended on the amount of rainfall between June and July, which was found to be as high as 700 mm [60]. Other studies indicate that hemp requires 25-35 cm of moisture during the vegetative stage and 50-70 cm of available moisture for optimum yield.
4. Hemp Fertility Requirements
4.1. Effect of Nitrogen
Nitrogen (N) plays a significant role in crop nutrition and yield, hence, is considered the most crucial nutrient in hemp production. This fact is well depicted by studies that have reported the responses of hemp to N fertilization. Application of N fertilizers positively affect hemp plant height,

Exhibit D Page 7 of 15

Agriculture 2020, 10, 129 8 of 15

biomass for fiber hemp varieties, and grain and protein content for seed yielding varieties. The N requirement is high during the first one month of hemp growth so N is usually applied at sowing in most field experiments. A study reported that 79% of total N uptake occurred within the first month with a daily N uptake of 3-4 kg ha-1 [66]. Another study reported that N application after sowing or applied by split method did not increase stem yield when compared to N distribution at sowing [67].
An increase in 60 kg dry matter (stem biomass) kg" N applied was noticed as N fertilization was
increased from 0 to 120 kg N ha-1. However, beyond N fertilization rates of 150 kg ha-1, no further
yield increase was reported [67]. Excess N application stimulates rapid stem elongation which makes
the hemp crop more susceptible to lodging [15]. Inadequate N, on the other hand, will cause loss of
yield, while excess will reduce the fiber quality. Various experimental results have confirmed that N fertilizer application should be determined based on initial soil fertility. A study conducted by [16] also concluded that hemp growth response to fertilizer N was negligible in soils rich in N. Due to differences in environmental conditions and methodologies, the stem biomass per unit of N fertilization cannot be accurately determined from literature data and therefore warrants more investigation. A recently conducted study reported that N deficiency symptoms were observed in greenhouse-grown hemp for CBD when the N content in the leaf tissue analysis was 1.62% [68]. However, more research is
needed to evaluate the effect of N application on the yield of seed and CBD hemp varieties under
field conditions.

4.2. Effect of Phosphorus
Phosphorous (P) is an essential macronutrient required throughout hemp growth stages. However, its demand gradually increases as the plant matures. P is also essential during the early growth stages of hemp as it plays a major role in imparting strength and resistance against pests. Limited research has been conducted on the effect of P on hemp production. Even though P
application increases plant height, it was concluded that its effects on hemp biomass and seed yields
were inconsistent and minimal, therefore very negligible [69]. Previous research also showed that hemp
response to P might vary depending on growing conditions [70], and its availability plays an important
role in the elasticity and tensile strength of hemp fibers. A study reported that P uptake by hemp ranged from 52 to 67 kg ha-1, and P fertilization had no effect on stem yield [67]. P enhancement treatment
caused a 16% reduction of THC concentration but did not affect CBD concentration in the flowers [71].
P deficiency can also affect hemp ability to uptake other essential nutrients, and can subsequently reduce the plant health, immunity to disease, crop quality, and yield. Hemp plants suffering from P deficiency show visual symptoms including stunted growth and development of reddish-purple color
in the leaf due to anthocyanin pigment formation [72]. In a recent study, leaf tissue analysis of P was
reported to be 0.09% for P deficient CBD hemp plants grown under greenhouse conditions [68].
4.3. Effect of Potassium
Hemp is less responsive to potassium (K) compared to N and P fertilization, and very few
experiments evaluating the effect of K on hemp have been conducted. One of the studies reported that K did not significantly affect hemp biomass and seed yield [68]. K is a macronutrient and is required in substantial quantities by hemp. K uptake increases as the crop grows which is similar to trends observed for P [73]. However, in the case of fiber hemp varieties, the peak uptake occurs during fiber developmental stages. K has been reported to have a more significant effect on fiber quality than P [27]. K fertilizer trials suggested that hemp should receive 175 kg K ha-1 [74]. A recent study conducted on CBD hemp under greenhouse conditions reported the K content in leaf tissue to be 0.41% for K deficient hemp plants [68]. However, the effect of K fertilization on the seed and CBD yields in hemp varieties in the field have not been reported to our knowledge.

Agriculture 2020, 10, 129 9 of 15

4.4. Effect of Other Nutrients
Hemp plants need a relatively substantial amount of magnesium (Mg) and are very sensitive to Mg
deficiency. Mg-deficient hemp plants are characterized by dark green younger leaves, grayish-white patches in older leaves due to loss of chlorophyll, and slowed root and shoot development. The need
for micronutrients for hemp is highly dependent on soil nutrient conditions, organic matter content, and soil texture. Copper (Cu) deficiency is commonly experienced in peat soils and its deficiency in hemp could lead to breaking of stems. Manganese (Mn) and boron (B) deficiencies have also been
reported in hemp [75]. A study conducted in Russia on peat-humus soils have shown that the yield and quality of fiber and seed hemp fertilized with sufficient P and K could be increased by supplemental application of 1 kg of B (as boric acid (H3BO3)), 1 kg of Cu (as copper sulfate (CuSOg), and 10 kg of Mn (as manganese sulfate (MnSO4)) ha-1 [76]. Leaf tissue analysis of CBD hemp during deficiency symptomology for a wide range of nutrients including Mg, Sulfur (S), B, Cu, Mn, molybdenum (Mo), and zinc (Zn) were reported in a study conducted by [68]. This study also suggested that with the exception of N, K, B, and Cu, other nutrient deficiencies did not significantly decrease the CBD hemp yield. More research at field scale is necessary to evaluate the effect of micronutrients on the
cannabinoids in CBD and seed yielding hemp varieties.

5. Hemp Agronomic Management Practices Intended to Improve Soil Health

5.1. Crop Rotation
Crop rotations are essential to disrupt pest cycles, maintain and enhance soil health, and crop diversification. Crop rotations also increase soil organic carbon and soil organic matter content [77]. Hemp grown for fiber can produce 25 t ha-1 aboveground biomass and large quantities of root biomass
that can be distributed deeper in the soil as compared to corn or wheat [16]. Over two-thirds of organic matter is replenished to the soil when fiber hemp is field retted, and improves soil porosity and
friability [78]. Fiber hemp plant is also deep-rooted and has been found to influence the soil structure. Its taproot penetrates deep into the ground aerating the soil at the same time building soil aggregates and preventing erosion [79]. A group of researchers evaluated hemp grown in monoculture and in rotation with wheat [80]. They concluded that hemp could be grown for several years in conventional monoculture without yield declines. Hemp increased wheat yields in two of three growing seasons and the researchers concluded that hemp had great potential as a predecessor for wheat under rainfed Mediterranean conditions. Another study reported a 10%-20% increase in the yield of wheat followed by the cultivation of hemp [55]. More recent research where soybean was grown as monoculture demonstrated that hemp cultivated earlier had a positive effect on soybean growth [81]. Some reports
have also suggested that growing hemp following alfalfa can improve hemp yield.
Hemp plant has been reported to decrease the population of nematodes and pathogenic fungi in
the soil, and it has been stated that hemp has the potential to be grown without the use of pesticides,
herbicides, or fungicides [82]. Three soil pathogens (the fungus Verticillium dahlia, root-knot nematodes Meloidogyne chitwoodi, and Meloidogyne hapla) were suppressed by hemp, and it was concluded that introducing hemp in a crop rotation might enhance soil health [83]. Hemp's high planting density, rapid soil surface coverage ability and fast growth (especially the fiber yielding) varieties after emergence render it very competitive against weeds [61]. This makes it potentially one of the greatest agronomic and environmental benefits of cultivating hemp in rotation with other crops. An experimental study also demonstrated hemp was able to suppress weed effectively without the use of herbicide, except for places where plant densities were relatively low, between 10 and 30 plants per m? [82]. In order to introduce hemp successfully into a crop rotation, information on the optimal sequencing of hemp with
other crops, the effect of integrating hemp into rotations on pests, and potential effects of hemp on soil
health is necessary and needs to be further investigated across diverse growing conditions in the US.

5.2. Organic Amendments
For generations, animal manures and composts have been identified as soil builders because of their enormous impact on improving soil health [84,85]. The nutrient content of animal waste varies
depending on different factors like feed source and type, animal age, handling and storing techniques, temperature, and moisture content. Organic amendments are rich with nutrients that are essential for plant's nutritional requirement, like N, which is one of the crucial nutrients required for hemp cultivation. They also add carbon to the soil and improve soil biodiversity. Organic amendments also help reduce nutrient run-offs and leaching of nitrates in the soil. Although various environmental
benefits can be derived from manure application, these benefits are optimized when it is applied at
an appropriate time and at appropriate amounts and techniques. Improper manure management might
contribute to increased greenhouse gas emissions [86]. Organic amendments come in various kinds,
and can be used depending on location and availability. The commonly used types of manures in hemp production are horse, cow, and chicken manure. It has been reported that hemp is naturally adapted to
using mammalian manure, e.g., horse manure as fertilizer, and it can also efficiently employ stocks of
livestock manure [78]. Composting of manure is a process that is recommended because it enhances the quality of manure and has been reported to improve soil health properties [85]. Chicken, horse,
and cow manure are recommended to undergo composting before usage to decrease the likelihood
of pathogens. It has been reported to contain about 1-2% N and 1-3% K but amounts might vary depending on the type of animal waste used. Although there is a huge potential to incorporate animal
wastes for hemp production not much has been reported.
Another source of organic amendment would be the application of mulches in hemp cultivation. Organic mulches, i.e., chopped leaves, straw, grass clippings, compost, wood chips, shredded bark, sawdust, pine needles, etc., application have multiple benefits. Mulches are intended to moderate
soil temperature fluctuations, improve soil structure by facilitating water and oxygen entry, provide conducive habitats for beneficial soil organisms, e.g., earthworms, reduce soil-borne pathogens, minimize surface runoff, prevent erosion, and reduce weed seed emergence. In cases where hemp
is grown for fiber, most of the leaves are returned to the field hence serving as mulch and thereby
preserving soil moisture and increasing microbial biodiversity in the soil [78]. Furthermore, when retting of hemp is done on the field, the stems are left behind, which also serves as soil mulch. Many of the
residual nutrients from the stalks are then returned to the soil, making them available for the next
year's crop. Most of the studies reported on CBD hemp uses black or white plastic mulches, and not
much is reported on the use of organic or biodegradable mulches.
5.3. Cover Crops in Hemp Rotation or Using Hemp as a Cover Crop
A cover crop is a crop that is planted mainly to the ecological benefit of soil rather than crop
yield [87]. Cover crops are typically grass or legumes and mostly grown in winter before the summer
cash crop. Incorporating leguminous cover crops that have biological N fixing capacity also has the potential to provide supplemental N requirements for the main crop in the cropping system. Cover crops also provide ecological benefits to the soil by suppressing weeds and pest pathogens, control soil erosion, help build and improve soil fertility, and increase biodiversity [85,88]. Hemp is an annual crop that could make it a good fit into crop rotation, although very few studies have been
conducted on the rotation effects of hemp. In addition, since certain varieties are very photosensitive,
there are challenges associated with using hemp as a cover crop. It has been reported that fiber hemp in crop rotation as a cover crop can suppress weed efficiently for the following crop [16] thereby, enhancing soil health by reducing the need for synthetic herbicides. A report suggested that using annual N-fixing cover crops, i.e., sweet clover, fababeans, peas, etc., could supplement the N requirement of hemp later in the season [59]. Some studies also showed that incorporating hemp in a crop rotation has allelopathic effects, thereby reducing pest nematodes. Therefore, hemp can serve as a nematicide for certain crops, e.g., potatoes, maize, peas, etc., that are susceptible to nematode infestation [89]. Certain hemp residues are also well suited for use as botanical insecticides [18].

6. Conclusions

Hemp production in the USA has been on the rise since the 21st century and more US states have
attempted to establish a hemp production system following deregulation according to the 2018 US Farm
Bill. This has significantly increased the potential for hemp markets in America. Many products can be derived from hemp, but the most enterprising situation for hemp in the USA is oilseed production and CBD extraction from hemp flowers for pharmaceutical uses. This review indicates that although there is a renewed interest in the adoption of hemp, its production in the USA remains limited partly because of unclear agronomic guidance and fertilization recommendations, especially for CBD hemp in different soil and environmental conditions. Hence, it is essential to explore and update the scientific knowledge of hemp in order to understand and recommend the best management practices. Hemp cultivation requires intensive management, and environmental conditions like seedbed preparation, soil type, day length, seeding rates, dates, harvest dates, etc., are all impacted by the type of hemp variety employed. Hemp varieties grown for fiber, oil seed, and CBD have different fertilizer requirements and
most of the fertility trials in the past have been limited to hemp for fiber. This review also describes
the potential of integrating agronomic management practices intended to improve soil health like crop rotation, cover cropping, mulching, and manure application to hemp cultivation. Hemp is a potential emerging multipurpose crop with not only economic but also soil health benefits through phytoremediation, bio-sequestration, and bioenergy production. More research on optimal agronomic production techniques needs to be conducted for increased productivity and sustainability in order to achieve the full potential of this high promising multi-purpose crop.

RECOMMENDATION

It is recommended that the Board:

1. Consider and adopt an Industrial Hemp Urgency Ordinance to establish a temporary moratorium on the cultivation of industrial hemp, with some exemptions, in all unincorporated portions of San Luis
Obispo County, by 4/5 vote.
2. Set a hearing date for July 16, 2019 to consider extending the Interim Urgency Ordinance.
3. Direct the County Clerk to publish notice of the public meeting no less than fifteen (15) days prior to
the date of the public meeting, pursuant to Government Code Section 25124.

DISCUSSION

Background
On May 21, 2019, the Board of Supervisors directed staff to draft an Industrial Hemp Urgency Ordinance to address local concerns regarding industrial hemp cultivation in San Luis Obispo County. The Board specified June 18, 2019 as the hearing date for the urgency ordinance to be heard. This report and associated draft ordinance are provided in response to the Board's direction.
Industrial Hemp Cultivation in San Luis Obispo County
Industrial hemp is defined as a crop that is limited to types of the plant Cannabis sativa L. (Linnaeus) having no more than three-tenths of 1 percent (0.3%) tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) contained in the dried flowering
tops, whether growing or not; the seeds of the plant; the resin extracted from any part of the plant; and every
compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds or resin produced therefrom. The definition of industrial hemp is in alignment at the Federal, State and local levels of
government.

Page 2 of 5
Exhibit E

The County cannabis ordinance that was adopted in November 2017 excluded industrial hemp from the
definition of cannabis for the purposes of that ordinance, specifically placing industrial hemp cultivation in
the "crop production and grazing" land use category for local land use regulation purposes. Although there are currently few restrictions on the cultivation of industrial hemp from local County land use regulations, there are still a wide variety of restrictions in place due to Federal and State law specific to the cultivation of industrial hemp. If adopted, this ordinance would establish the first agricultural commodity regulated by San
Luis Obispo County in this manner. It should be noted that the agricultural industry in San Luis Obispo County
is concerned over the precedent that this action would set for future regulation of other agricultural
commodities.

Prior to the signing of the 2018 Farm Bill, industrial hemp a was listed as a controlled substance under the
federal Controlled Substances Act. The 2018 Farm Bill removed industrial hemp from the list of controlled
substances and designated it as an agricultural commodity, subject to specific regulations. Additionally, federal law now allows the cultivation of commercial industrial hemp and the cultivation of industrial hemp
for research purposes if it is in produced in accordance with an approved state program.

Specifically, state law requires that commercial growers of industrial hemp register with the County Agricultural Commissioner prior to cultivation. Additionally, growers of industrial hemp for research purposes are not required to register but are required to notify the Agricultural Commissioner as to the location of any
industrial hemp being grown for research. The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA)
submitted a regulatory package outlining the registration process and that regulatory package was approved
by the Office of Administrative law in April of 2019. The San Luis Obispo County Agricultural Commissioner
began registering industrial hemp growers shortly after the initial regulations were adopted. This registration process includes the collection of a mandated $900 fee which is remitted to CDFA and then redistributed to
counties to support the statewide regulatory program. As of June 6, 2019, the number of applications submitted to the Agricultural Commissioner is 31, of those, 12 have been approved for cultivation. The total
area approved through registration is 82.3 acres. Because some growers have been registered, vested rights
may need to be addressed in this proposed ordinance.

A secondary, Emergency Regulatory package was submitted by CDFA in May of 2019 which outlines the regulatory framework for sampling, testing and enforcement of noncompliant commercial industrial hemp grows. These regulations are anticipated to be adopted in June 2019. Included in this emergency regulatory package are requirements for official sampling of the mature crop and testing by a certified lab to establish
the level of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) does not exceed the legal limits of 0.3%. Additionally, these proposed
regulations outline an enforcement framework for hemp crops that fail the THC testing limits. All regulations specific to industrial hemp cultivation fall under the authority of County Agricultural Commissioners.

Most, if not all, individuals interested in cultivating industrial hemp in San Luis Obispo County intend to
produce the plant to extract Cannabidiol or CBD oil and not to produce fiber. CBD is desired for its
therapeutic properties such as treating seizures and anxiety.

Because industrial hemp and cannabis are so similar, differentiating them in the field is difficult absent
laboratory testing. The difficulty in making this distinction could lead to illegal cannabis being produced under the guise of industrial hemp. With the reduced regulatory requirements for industrial hemp being produced for research purposes, there is a possibility of unpermitted cannabis grows being undetected. In

Page 3 of 5
Exhibit E

addition to these concerns, industrial hemp being produced for CBD may have similar odor issues that
have been associated with cannabis production as well as the potential for cross pollination with permitted
cannabis cultivation.

Statewide, approximately half of California counties have imposed a moratorium on industrial hemp cultivation. Most have imposed moratoriums pending the adoption of complete state regulations. As noted, state regulations have been submitted through the emergency regulatory process and are expected to be in
effect in the near future.

The proposed urgency ordinance generally prohibits hemp cultivation within the unincorporated areas of San Luis Obispo County. If adopted, the Ordinance will be in effect for 45 days with potential extension(s) for a cumulative total of 2 years. An extension is tentatively scheduled to be brought to the Board on July 16,
2019.

If the ordinance is adopted, any currently unregistered industrial hemp production would be considered unpermitted and would be subject to enforcement as outlined in the San Luis Obispo County Cannabis Ordinance.
Options for Future Permanent Ordinance The County Board of Supervisors has the legal authority to regulate industrial hemp through land use. As such, your Board may consider directing staff to prepare a permanent ordinance. The ordinance may include
the following or variations thereof depending on Board direction.

1. Prepare an ordinance that prohibits industrial hemp in all unincorporated areas of the County.
2. Prepare an ordinance that regulates where industrial hemp can occur in the unincorporated areas of the County. For example, cultivation of industrial hemp could be limited to occur only in certain designated areas, such as Agriculture, and on parcels of a certain minimum size or more, along with
setback requirements of a minimum established distance from the property boundary.
Depending on the nature of the ordinance, the staff time to prepare the ordinance will vary. Preparation of the ordinance will require the involvement of multiple departments. The ordinance development process would include public hearing(s) at the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors for adoption.

OTHER AGENCY INVOLVEMENT/IMPACT
This item included input from the Department of Planning and Building, County Counsel and the
Administrative Office.

BUSINESS IMPACT STATEMENT
Because there has been no previous indication to the public that a moratorium on industrial hemp would be
considered, this item may have in impact on existing or new businesses that have based all or part of their
agricultural business plan on the production of industrial hemp. Some producers have already registered
with the County Agricultural Commissioner to grow industrial hemp and have expended business capital to
pursue that goal. Other businesses may have expended business capital to pursue industrial hemp
cultivation but have not yet registered with the County Agricultural Commissioner.
Based on general industry averages, the gross, farmgate value of industrial hemp is approximately $60,000 on a per acre basis. This value was generated assuming the average value for one pound of dried flower is

Page 4 of 5
Exhibit E

$60 per pound and a yield of 1,000 pounds per acre.

There is no cost, other than staff time, associated with the development of this ordinance. A Budget FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Augmentation Request (BAR) for Fiscal Year 2019/20 was recommended to address the workload anticipated for the registration of industrial hemp producers, sampling, testing and enforcement of noncompliant industrial hemp crops. The cost of this BAR will be funded through CDFA cooperative agreements, unclaimed gas tax and local fees.

If adopted, a temporary moratorium on the cultivation of Industrial Hemp, with some exemptions, would RESULTS

prohibit individuals from cultivating Industrial Hemp for an initial period of 45 days. Prior to the expiration of the initial 45-day period, the Board has the authority to extend the urgency ordinance for a cumulative period of 2 years from the date of original adoption.

U.C. Coop. Extension, Farm Advisor Mark Battany ALAB recommends that County Planning strive to develop this ordinance,
and its associated requirements and restrictions, in a manner that minimizes
conflicts with existing agricultural operations and businesses.
ALAB recommends that County Planning consider the implementation of a
sliding scale for setback requirements based upon the number of industrial hemp acres being cultivated.
Although ALAB could not come to consensus on exactly what those setback distances should be, it was agreed that it is logical to require smaller setback distances from smaller sized growing sites, relative to the acreage of
the hemp growing site.

Exhibit G - Page 1 of 2

In Section 22.30.244 (B.)1.c: ALAB recommends that riparian and wetland setbacks be struck from the ordinance due to this requirement being duplicative of existing requirements from other agencies that growers must
already meet.
ALAB recommends that direction is given to the Agricultural Commissioner's Office to develop a set of
recommended and/or required Best Management Practices (BMP's) for the cultivation of industrial hemp locally. Once these BMP'S are developed, ALAB recommends that consideration is given toward incorporating those BMP's into the industrial hemp registration process conducted by the Agricultural Commissioner's Office.
ALAB strongly recommends that as new research on the potential impacts of hemp cultivation (and processing) becomes available that this new scientific information is examined in the context of any permanent hemp
ordinance that is enacted by the county. ALAB recommends that this review occur annually, and the permanent hemp ordinance be amended to reflect new research information and associated impacts, if necessary and/or
warranted.

Thank you for your consideration of these recommendations.

Sincerely,

Jean-Pierre Wolff, Ph.D.

DISCUSSION

Background

Regulatory Framework
Industrial hemp is defined by Section 11018.5 of the California Health and Safety Code as:
A crop that is limited to types of the plant Cannabis sativa L. having no more than three-tenths of one (1) percent tetrahydrocannabinol ("THC") contained in the dried flowering tops, whether growing or not; the seeds of the plant; the resin extracted from any part of the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds or resin produced therefrom.

Section 81000 of the California Food and Agricultural Code states "industrial hemp" has the same meaning as that term as defined in Section 11018.5 of the Health and Safety Code. Title 22 and the San Luis Obispo County Coastal

Page 2 of 12
Exhibit H - Page 2 of 348

Zone Framework for Planning define industrial hemp consistent with Section 81000 of the Food and Agricultural Code and Section 11018.5 of the Health and Safety Code, as they may be amended.
Prior to the signing of the 2018 Farm Bill, industrial hemp was listed as a controlled substance under the federal Controlled Substances Act, however, cultivation of industrial hemp for research purposes under an agricultural pilot program or by institutions of higher education was permitted under the 2014 Farm Bill. The 2018 Farm Bill removed
industrial hemp from the list of controlled substances and designated it as it an agricultural commodity, subject to specific regulations, including the requirement to be conducted pursuant to an approved state or federal program. Until approval of a state or federal program, cultivation of industrial hemp remains limited to the requirements under the 2014 Farm Bill. Effective January 1, 2020, State law requires commercial and research growers of industrial hemp to register with the County Agricultural Commissioner prior to cultivation. Registration is conducted on an annual basis. The San Luis Obispo County Cannabis Ordinance, adopted in November 2017, specifically placed industrial hemp cultivation in the "crop production and grazing" land use category.

In October 2019, Senate Bill 153 was enacted. This bill impacted entities that were cultivating under the "established
agricultural research institute" exemption. SB153 narrowed the definition of research institute to institutions of higher education conducting agricultural or academic research, and now requires hemp research growers to submit a full registration application to the Agricultural Commissioner's Office. Any research related hemp occurring in association with a university would not be under the land use authority of the County, e.g. hemp research at Cal Poly State University. The regulations contained in the proposed public hearing draft ordinances will apply to any commercial industrial hemp operations.

Urgency Ordinance On May 21, 2019, the Board of Supervisors ("Board") directed staff to draft the Industrial Hemp Urgency Ordinance ("Urgency Ordinance") to address local concerns regarding industrial hemp cultivation in San Luis Obispo County. The Board adopted the Urgency Ordinance on June 18, 2019, which applied a temporary moratorium on the cultivation of industrial hemp in San Luis Obispo County. Upon adoption of the Urgency Ordinance, the Department of Agriculture/Weights and Measures ceased issuance of any new industrial hemp registrations aside from those that were issued prior to the Urgency Ordinance effective date. As of the effective date of the Urgency Ordinance, registered growers included 16 commercial growers with a total of 452 acres and 9 entities cultivating industrial hemp for research purposes. Under the Urgency Ordinance, these research growers could cultivate industrial hemp through December 31, 2019. The Urgency Ordinance will expire on June 18, 2020. If the Board does not adopt a permanent hemp ordinance by that expiration date, and does not extend the Urgency Ordinance, hemp cultivation will be allowed in the County subject to land use regulations for Crop Production and Grazing.

On June 18, 2019, the Board directed staff to prepare a permanent ordinance that would allow industrial hemp cultivation to occur within the unincorporated county with limitations based on land use category, parcel size, and setback requirements, The Board directed that the permanent ordinance should not establish a discretionary use permit process but establish a regulatory framework as to where hemp cultivation may occur by-right. On July 2, 2019, the Agricultural Liaison Advisory Board ("ALAB") submitted a letter to the Board with concerns about the land
use regulations imposed on industrial hemp production, emphasizing that hemp should not have land use restrictions
different from other legal crops, and expressing concerns about the precedent that this action could set for future
regulation of other agricultural commodities. On July 16, 2019, the Board voted to extend the urgency ordinance through June 2020. At that same meeting the Board directed staff to work with ALAB to serve as the advisory group for drafting the permanent hemp ordinance.

Page 3 of 12
Exhibit H - Page 3 of 348

At the August 5, 2019 ALAB meeting, a subcommittee was formed to work with the Department of Planning and Building ("Department") to draft the permanent hemp ordinance. Members of the original subcommittee consisted of representatives of the hemp industry, wine grape industry, ALAB members, vegetable industry members, and representatives of the Farm Bureau. Other industry members, interested members of the public, representatives of the Department and the Department of Agriculture/Weights and Measures were also in attendance. The subcommittee discussions focused on the Board-directed topics of zoning limitations, setbacks, and minimum parcel size. The subcommittee met three times in August 2019 and presented their recommendations and areas of
consensus to ALAB.

The subcommittee had consensus on:
Both indoor and outdoor hemp cultivation should be allowed on Agriculture ("AG") and Rural Lands ("RL") zoned parcels.

• Limitations to outdoor cultivation for transplants only in Residential Rural ("RR") because of their lack of odor
before the flowering stage. Setbacks should be measured from particular identified off-site uses, rather than from a grower's property lines.

The subcommittee did not have consensus on:
What distance setbacks or buffers should be established. Discussions ranged from 50 feet to ½ mile (2,640
feet).
What the sensitive uses should be. Most of those discussed were included in the Public Hearing Draft as
presented at the Planning Commission ("Commission").

At the September 9th ALAB meeting, it was recommended the hemp subcommittee continue to meet, recognizing that the meetings would continue in parallel to a staff developing a Public Review Draft. The subcommittee met three subsequent times from October - December 2019. A summary of both rounds of subcommittee meetings along with ALAB's letter of recommendation from their December 18th meeting has been attached (Attachment 12).

Proposed Ordinance Summary

The proposed ordinance amendments were developed based on research, input from the ALAB subcommittee, public comment, and Planning Commission recommendations. As stated above, the Board provided direction to the
Department of Planning and Building during the urgency ordinance extension hearing as summarized in the table below. Ministerial review based on Planning Commission recommendation is included in the proposed ordinance summary in Table 1 below.

Analysis of Planning Commission Recommendations

On January 23, 2020 the Planning Commission met and recommended the Board approve the proposed ordinance
changes. The Commission also provided three recommendations for the Board to consider in their deliberations.
Planning Commission recommendations #1 and #2 (below) have been incorporated into the revised draft ordinance and attached (Attachments 2-8). Planning Commission Recommendation #3 (below) is discussed below along with two alternate options. The Staff Report for the Planning Commission hearing, which includes more detailed discussions on cultivation standards, processing, manufacturing, and enforcement has also been attached (Attachment 11) for reference.

The following is an analysis of the Planning Commission Recommendations:

Planning Commission Recommendation #1:
The Commission recommended allowing reductions in minimum lot sizes subject to a discretionary permit such as a Minor Use Permit. Previous drafts of the ordinance had established minimum lot sizes based on Board direction, but the point was raised at the hearing that this would be a way to incorporate greater flexibility into the ordinance. Staff is proposing to include the following language in chapter 22.30.244 and chapter 23.08.047 to address the Commission's suggestion (underline and italicized):

Page 5 of 12
Exhibit H - Page 5 of 348

Outdoor industrial hemp cultivation is limited to sites of ten (10) acres or larger. Indoor industrial hemp cultivation is limited to sites of five (5) acres or larger. This limitation may be modified through
Minor Use Permit approval

Planning Commission Recommendation #2;
The Commission recommended a discretionary permit such as a Minor Use Permit be required for outdoor flowering hemp within 1,000 feet of any Urban Reserve Line (URL) or Village Reserve Line (VRL.). The Commission also discussed whether it should be possible to reduce the required 300-foot setback from sensitive uses, but ultimately decided against it. Therefore, if the Board chose to adopt the Planning Commission's recommendation, discretionary permitting would be required between 300-1,000 feet of URLs and VRLs. Farther than 1,000 feet, outdoor flowering hemp could be cultivated by-right (in the identified land use categories except in the Residential Rural Land Use Category), requiring only registration with the Department of Agriculture/Weights and Measures Office per State requirements. Staff incorporated permit requirements in chapter 22.30.244 and 23.08.047 (Attachments 3 6)
including the following language to address the Commission's suggestion (underline and italicized):

Minor Use Permit approval is required for all flowering (non-transplant) outdoor industrial hemp cultivation
within 300-1.000 feet of a URL or VRL,

Planning Commission Recommendation #3:

The Board directed staff to evaluate whether there are special areas of the County where industrial hemp cultivation should be excluded and return to the Planning Commission for review and recommendation to the Board. This topic was a frequent point of discussion in public comment prior to, and at, the Planning Commission hearing. Specifically, members of the public and the wine industry spoke about Edna Valley and the possibility for conflict between industrial hemp cultivation, the residential community, and the existing wine industry. The topic of terpene taint was also discussed. Terpenes are volatile organic compounds that can possess a strong odor and can evaporate from plant oils where they are present and be released into the air. It is important to note that there is a lack of scientific research regarding the effects of hemp terpenes on wine grapes, although is that is likely to change in the near future as research is underway. The case was made by some members of the wine industry that the unique geography of the Edna Valley makes the wine industry there especially vulnerable to hemp odors.
The Commission did not provide direction as to which specific characteristics should be considered in defining exclusion areas. Staff recognizes that identifying areas for exclusion based on unique geographic features presents a challenge due to the many micro-climates with unique geography within the county. The Planning Commission also discussed American Viticultural Areas ("AVAs") and whether to not allow hemp within a defined AVA. AVAs are distinguished by specific geographic or climatic features that distinguish them from surrounding regions and affect how grapes are grown. San Luis Obispo County has 5 major AVAs, which include an additional 11 sub-areas within the Paso Robles AVA. Commissioner Multari pointed out that in the case of the Edna Valley AVA, the boundaries cross into the City of San Luis Obispo. The Commission did not suggest that AVAs should be the delineation for exclusion areas. Instead the Commission highlighted the criteria for exclusion areas for discussion by the Board and requested the Board direct staff as to whether exclusion areas should be pursued.
Aside from identifying specific exclusion areas, there is the possibility that some of the concerns identified by public comment and heard at the Planning Commission hearing may be addressed through alternate options as described below for Board consideration.

Page 6 of 12
Exhibit H - Page 6 of 348

Planning Commission Recommendation: Require a Minor Use Permit for outdoor industrial hemp cultivation within 300-1,000 feet of a URL or VRL (see Planning Commission Recommendation #2, above). This language is already included in the Public Hearing Draft. Two alternative options are included below.
Option 1: Establish a 1-mile area around URLs and VRLs that would require discretionary permitting. This would expand upon the 300-1,000-foot area recommended by Planning Commission as requiring discretionary permitting for outdoor flowering (non-transplant) hemp. The language could be amended as follows:
Minor Use Permit approval is required for all flowering (non-transplant) outdoor industrial hemp cultivation within 300 feet - 1,000-feet one mile of a URL or VRL,

Expanding the area around URLs and VRLs would allow for greater discretion in those areas of the county that are more densely populated, while providing for greater flexibility for cultivation than an outright prohibition area. Figure 1 below shows both 1,000-foot and 1-mile discretionary areas from URLs and VRLs. 2 Figure 2 highlights those two discretionary permitting area options shown overlaid with the Edna Valley AVA outline taken from the Alcohol Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, while Figure 3 shows the two options overlaid with the Templeton VRL and AVA.
Option 2: Establish an Industrial Hemp Prohibition area for outdoor flowering (non-transplant) industrial hemp cultivation within a certain distance from URLs and VRLs. This option would identify prohibition areas around the county related to population density and the prevalence of sensitive uses. This would be the more restrictive of the
two alternative options. This option would be one way of establishing exclusion zones based around proximity to URLs and VRLs within the County.

Environmental Determination
Also, to be considered by your Board is the environmental determination that the project is exempt under CEQA, pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15061(b)(3), General Rule Exemption. The proposed amendments to the Land Use Ordinance, Coastal Zone Land Use Ordinance, and County General Plan place limited restrictions on the cultivation of industrial hemp crops. Crop production and grazing is currently an allowed use by-right within the County of San Luis Obispo, and no new uses are proposed. The Environmental Coordinator has determined that it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that the proposed project may have a significant adverse effect on the environment. A Notice of Exemption has been prepared pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15062.

Senate Bill No. 18 (SB-18) - Traditional tribal cultural places Pursuant to the requirements of Senate Bill 18 (SB 18 - 2004), any County that considers a General Plan Amendment must invite representatives from affected local tribes to participate in meaningful consultation with the local government for the purpose of discussing tribal concerns related to the proposed project. SB 18 consultation was initiated for the proposed amendments in October 2019. No requests for consultation were received.

Page 10 of 12
Exhibit H - Page 10 of 348

OTHER AGENCY INVOLVEMENT/IMPACT
The Department referred the amendments to all applicable State and local responsible agencies, including the Public Works Department, Cal Fire, County Environmental Health, City of San Luis Obispo, City of Grover Beach, City of Morro Bay, City of Arroyo Grande, City of Paso Robles, City of Atascadero, City of Pismo Beach, All Community Advisory Groups, Air Pollution Control District, California Coastal Commission, Farm Bureau, neighboring counties, California Coastal Commission, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, US Department of Fish and Wildlife, Regional Water Quality Control Board, California Department of Conservation, Agricultural Liaison Advisory Board, and the interested parties e-mail list. Staff received comment letters from various groups and individuals, which are included in the Response to Comments within Attachment 11. The County also participated in workshops with the ALAB Industrial Hemp Subcommittee, which were open to the public and included members of the hemp industry and other agricultural industries. The Planning Commission reviewed and recommended Board adoption of the ordinance amendments with additional recommendations as discussed above. In addition, County Counsel reviewed and approved the resolution and ordinances as to form and legal effect.

BUSINESS IMPACT STATEMENT
Approving this request may result in positive and negative impacts to the Uniquely SLO County Cluster identified in
the San Luis Obispo County Clusters of Opportunity Economic Strategy (November 2010). The proposed ordinance amendments will allow for the cultivation of a new crop within the region with restrictions on land use. Allowing the cultivation of Industrial hemp has the potential to benefit farmers in the County who wish to invest in the new hemp market. However, there is the possibility that Industrial hemp cultivation could negatively impact the Uniquely SLO County Cluster, particularly the wine tourism industry, which could potentially be affected by odors caused by
Industrial hemp cultivation.

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Multiple County departments have been challenged to respond to the legalization of cannabis in California. The Board, the County, and the public have been tasked with developing governance, regulations and oversight to manage how crop cultivation, production, and resell will take place. Because hemp is a cannabis crop not normally associated with THC, the County anticipates similar resources will be required for developing the regulations and providing oversight as cannabis.

Planning and Building has been the primary author of multiple ordinances and revisions for Board adoption for cannabis. Adopted ordinances have included the requirement of land use permits to be processed through the department. Managing the staff and consultants to process these permits through application acceptance and the often-contentious public hearing process continues to require significant department resources. Compliance
monitoring and investigation of unpermitted activity has also required significant department resources, which are
generally not reimbursed through any cannabis revenues.

Regarding hemp specifically, the Department of Agriculture/Weights and Measures expects to recover the costs to
implement the state regulatory program through a contract with the California Department of Food and Agriculture. This is primarily to cover County costs for registering hemp growers and assuring compliance with State law. These contracts rarely recover 100% of the costs, but the General Fund impact is expected to be relatively low, The
department also recovers costs through a fee schedule by billing each grower for activities not covered under the
contract such as testing hemp crops for THC content. Code enforcement will likely be the largest demand on County resources because the County can expect complaints, as an example, about odor or whether a crop is hemp

Page 11 of 12
Exhibit H - Page 11 of 348

or cannabis. It is not possible to predict how much staff time this require until an ordinance has been in place for
some period of time.

RESULTS
Approval of the attached resolution would amend Title 22 of the County Code, Title 23 of the County Code, Coastal Framework for Planning Table "O", and Title 1 of the County Code to allow for the regulation and enforcement of the cultivation of Industrial Hemp in the unincorporated areas of the County.
The amendments to Title 22 and Title 1 of the County Code would become effective 30 days after today's date (May 5, 2020).

The Coastal Zone amendments will also require California Coastal Commission approval. The Department will submit the amendments to the California Coastal Commission after final Board action. If the California Coastal Commission approves and certifies the amendments, they will take effect immediately. If the California Coastal Commission approves the amendments with suggested modifications, the Department will return to the Board for consideration and approval of the California Coastal Commission's suggested modifications.

Michael Multari: suggests treating Hemp as a non-discretionary crop and provides reasoning.

Commissioners: discuss having special areas of the county where Hemp cultivation would be prohibited. Don Campbell is willing to extend the Urgency Ordinance. Michael Multari is inclined to
forward staff's recommendation along with additional comments with Dawn Ortiz-Legg and Jay
Brown in agreement.

Michael Multari: would like to convey to the Board of Supervisors that if there may be sub areas of
the county exempting hemp cultivation then Hemp cultivation should be subject to a Minor Use
Permit application.

Don Campbell: cannot support the recommendation until further research has been conducted on
the effect Hemp will be on the Wine industry.

Michael Multari: suggests a straw vote for those in favor of forwarding the recommendation to the Board of Supervisors asking them to evaluate special areas within the county where Hemp cultivation
would be prohibited and potentially direct staff to further evaluate these areas.

Dawn Ortiz-Legg suggests annual review of these special areas based on possible new scientific
information.

Don Campbell: is willing to accept an extension to the Urgency Ordinance due to the research he would like conducted. Cannot straw vote yes or no.

Jay Brown: is inclined to vote with Comm. Multari's recommendation as well as Comm. Ortiz-Legg.

Dawn Ortiz-Legg: would also like to allow a smaller lot minimum size.

Michael Multari: suggests the Board of Supervisors consider that there may be special sub areas of
the county that are particularly sensitive where industrial Hemp is not an appropriate use.
Additionally, we should allow reductions in the minimum sizes and setbacks subject to a discretionary
approval such as a Minor Use Permit.

Don Campbell: understands the intent, however, feels extending the Urgency Ordinance with the same allowances is preferable to him.

Rob Fitzroy, Assistant Director: suggests an option to continue this hearing to give commissioners
time to provide direction to staff and return.

Commissioners: deliberate a continuance and an extension of the Urgency Ordinance.

Brian Stack, Deputy County Counsel: explains the limited exemptions adopted for the Urgency Ordinance, in regard to an extension of the Urgency Ordinance.

Commissioners: decide to take an action on the amendments to the ordinance today.

PROJECT SUMMARY

The Public Hearing Drafts ("PHD Ordinances") found in Attachment 2 (Redline Version) and Attachment 3 (Clean Version) contain standards for establishing the cultivation and processing of industrial hemp as defined by the PHD Ordinances, regulations for location and operation of that use, and provisions for enforcement activities. Industrial hemp cultivation is regulated through restrictions to land use category, location standards, and parcel size.

DISCUSSION

Background

Industrial hemp as defined by Section 11018.5 of the California Health and Safety Code means a fiber or oilseed crop, or both, that is limited to types of the plant Cannabis sativa L. having no more than three-tenths of 1 percent (0.3%) tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) contained in the dried flowering tops, whether growing or not; the seeds of the plant; the resin extracted from any part of the plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of the plant, its seeds or resin produced therefrom. Section 81000 of the California Food and Agricultural Code states "industrial hemp" has the same meaning as that term is defined in Section 11018.5 of the Health and Safety Code. Title 22 and the San Luis Obispo County Coastal Zone Framework for Planning define industrial hemp consistent with Section 81000 of the Food and Agricultural Code or Section 11018.5 of the Health and Safety Code, as they may be amended.
Prior to the signing of the 2018 Farm Bill, industrial hemp was listed as a controlled substance under the federal Controlled Substances Act. The 2018 Farm Bill removed industrial hemp from the list of controlled substances and designated it as an agricultural commodity, subject to specific regulations. Federal law allows the cultivation of commercial industrial hemp and the cultivation of industrial hemp for research purposes if it is produced in accordance with an approved state program. Specifically, state law requires that commercial growers of industrial hemp register with the County Agricultural Commissioner prior to cultivation. Registration is conducted on an annual basis. The County cannabis ordinance adopted in November 2017 excluded industrial hemp from the definition of cannabis, and specifically placed industrial hemp cultivation in the "crop production and grazing" land use category.
On May 21, 2019, the Board of Supervisors ("Board") directed staff to draft the Industrial Hemp Urgency Ordinance to address local concerns regarding industrial hemp cultivation in San Luis Obispo County. The Board adopted the urgency ordinance on June 18, 2019, which applied a temporary moratorium on the cultivation of industrial hemp in San Luis Obispo County. Upon adoption of the urgency ordinance, the Department of Agriculture/Weights and Measures ceased issuance of any new industrial hemp registrations aside from those that were issued prior to the urgency ordinance effective date. Registered growers include 17 commercial growers with a total of 452 acres and 9 entities cultivating industrial hemp for research purposes as of the effective date of the urgency ordinance. Under the urgency ordinance, these research growers were allowed to cultivate industrial hemp through December 31, 2019.
On June 18, 2019, the Board directed staff to prepare a permanent ordinance that would allow industrial hemp cultivation to occur within the County with limitations based on land use category, parcel size, and setback requirements. The Board directed that the permanent ordinance should not establish a discretionary use permit process, but only establish a regulatory framework as to

Page 2 of 2 259 Exhibit H - Page 82 of 348

Attachment 11 Planning Commission LUO, CZLUO, and Coastal Framework Amendment LRP2019-00008 County of SLO - Industrial Hemp Ordinance
Page

where hemp cultivation may occur by-right. On July 2, 2019, the Agricultural Liaison Advisory Board (ALAB) submitted a letter to the Board of Supervisors with concerns about the land use regulations imposed on industrial hemp production, emphasizing that hemp should not have land use restrictions different from other legal crops, and expressing concerns about the precedent that this action could set for future regulation of other agricultural commodities. On July 16, 2019, the Board of Supervisors voted to extend the urgency ordinance through June 2020. At that same meeting the Board directed staff to work with ALAB to serve as the advisory group for drafting the permanent hemp ordinance.

Board Direction, ALAB input, and public comment

The proposed ordinance amendments were developed based on research, input from the ALAB subcommittee, and public comment. As stated above, the Board provided direction to the Department of Planning and Building during the urgency ordinance extension hearing as summarized in the table below.

TABLE 2: SUMMARY OF BOARD DIRECTION & PROPOSED ORDINANCE
Board Direction Proposed Ordinance based on Board Direction, ALAB
subcommittee, and public comment
Ministerial approval process Industrial Hemp Cultivation will be considered a
subcategory of Crop Production and Grazing subject to
specific land use requirements, but not requiring
discretionary review.
Limits to land use categories Industrial Hemp Cultivation will be limited to the
Agriculture, Rural Lands, and Residential Rural land use
categories.
Residential Rural outdoor cultivation will be limited to
non-flowering transplants only.
Establish Setbacks Outdoor industrial hemp cultivation shall not be located
within three-hundred (300) feet of any active crop production or cannabis grow of separate ownership (excluding pasture or rangeland), any tasting rooms, Residential Single Family (RSF), Residential Multi-Family (RMF), Residential Suburban (RS) land uses categories, Urban Reserve Lines (URL), Village Reserve Lines
(VRL), schools, religious facilities, or existing offsite residences.
Indoor industrial hemp cultivation is limited to fully enclosed buildings or greenhouses and setback 100 feet from any existing offsite residence, swimming pool, patio,
or other living area of separate ownership, and require
ventilation controls to eliminate nuisance odors.

ALAB Hemp Subcommittee

At the August 5, 2019 ALAB meeting, a subcommittee was formed to work with the Planning and Building Department to draft the permanent hemp ordinance. Members of the original subcommittee consisted of representatives of the hemp industry, wine grape industry, ALAB members, vegetable industry members, and representatives of the Farm Bureau. Other industry members, interested parties, representatives of the Planning and Building Department and the Department of Agriculture/Weights and Measures were also in attendance. Three initial subcommittee meetings were held, and the results of those meetings were presented at the September 9, 2019 ALAB meeting (attached). The subcommittee discussions focused on the
Board-directed topics of zoning limitations, setbacks, and minimum parcel size. While the subcommittee did not come to consensus on all issues, they agreed on the following:

ZONING LIMITATIONS:
Agriculture (AG) and Rural Lands (RL) zoned parcels: Hemp cultivation, both indoor
and outdoor, should be allowed on these properties.
On lands zoned Rural Residential (RR), cultivation of transplants should be allowed. Since transplants will be defined as only non-flowering plants, this cultivation should be allowed both indoors and outdoors. It is recognized that transpiant growing will typically be done indoors in greenhouses on RR zoned properties, but they may need to move them outside to harden them off prior to shipping and there is no reason to disallow that ability. On lands zoned Rural Residential (RR), Industrial (IND), and Commercial Services (CS), growers would have the option of going through the discretionary use permit process (Minor Use Permit) to grow full flowering plants.

SETBACKS or BUFFERS:
The subcommittee agreed that any setbacks that may be established should be measured from a specific identified uses and boundaries off-site from the hemp
grower's parcel and not from the hemp grower's property line. In other words, there is no need for setbacks from a grower's property line if the hemp cultivation is taking place well away from any potential conflicts.
The subcommittee agreed that any setbacks or buffers that may be established
should be measured from a "sensitive site" or "sensitive receptor". There was not an
agreement established on exactly what those sensitive receptors should be. Items
discussed included schools and state licensed daycares, residential zoned areas or
properties (as opposed to a single residence a or a couple of residences located on agricultural zoned lands), existing agricultural crops/commodities, wineries, and
winery tasting rooms.

MINIMUM PARCEL SIZES:
The subcommittee agreed that a minimum parcel size was not required. It was discussed that any setbacks or buffers developed would be geared toward alleviating
land use conflict between neighbors, and would be more effective than a minimum
parcel size (e.g. if there was a minimum parcel size but no setback/buffer established,

Page 4 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 84 of 348

Attachment 11 Planning Commission LUO, CZLUO, and Coastal Framework Amendment LRP2019-00008 County of SLO - Industrial Hemp Ordinance
Page

than the grower could still plant in a corner of his property close directly adjacent to other residences or established crops and a required minimum parcel size would be ineffective). In addition, by not allowing full flowering hemp plants on those parcels zoned for residential land uses, that alleviates much of the need to establish minimum
parcel sizes.

Some of the recommendations of the subcommittee were incorporated into the Public Review Draft. The limiting of Industrial Hemp Cultivation to Agriculture, Rural lands, and Residential Rural land use categories were incorporated, as were restrictions on cultivation of outdoor transplants in the Residential Rural land use category. Per the subcommittee's rècommendation, setbacks were established from the areas of cultivation to specific uses rather than from property lines or public right of ways. Broadening the land use categories where cultivation would be permitted through a discretionary permitting process was not incorporated into the draft, as the Board direction was to establish a non-discretionary process. The public review draft also incorporated minimum parcel sizes per Board direction.

Cultivation Standards

The subcommittee did not reach consensus on what the distance setbacks should be. There is a lack of currently available scientific research on hemp odor or the potential for terpene taint affecting crops such as grapes, making it difficult to determine a logical rationale for a specific setback distance. It is likely that this research will be forthcoming in the near future. The setback distances for outdoor (300 ft) and indoor (100 ft) cultivation are consistent with those in the Cannabis Ordinance, although in the Cannabis ordinance these setbacks are from property lines for outdoor cultivation and from specific offsite uses for indoor cultivation. The proposed setbacks for the Industrial Hemp Ordinance are based on setbacks from specific uses rather than property lines. The 1,000-foot setback from "sensitive receptors" in the Cannabis Ordinance was not incorporated into the Industrial Hemp Ordinance for two reasons. The first is that the term "sensitive receptor" has a specific meaning per the California Health and Safety Code. Sensitive receptor provisions under the California Health and Safety Code don't relate to agricultural odors. The second is that the 1,000-foot setback was taken from Proposition 64 aimed at diversion to minors because of Cannabis's status as a federally illegal schedule drug, which is not the case with hemp. This standard was not based on odor.
The subcommittee and Agricultural Commissioner's Office specified that there is an important difference between flowering (odor-causing) and transplant-only cultivation. This distinction informed Staff's recommendation and was incorporated into the setbacks for the public review draft. However, staff determined that having distinct setbacks for only flowering plants rather than transplants would lead to the inability for code enforcement officers to be able to distinguish between them until after plants had flowered. As such, the proposed ordinance has been revised to include setbacks for transplant as well. Setbacks are measured from the location of the
proposed outdoor or indoor hemp cultivation to the nearest point of the existing sensitive use or area boundary. Per Board direction, minimum parcel sizes were added consistent with the 10- acre outdoor minimum for Cannabis cultivation allowed in the Agricultural Land Use Category. A smaller parcel size is more appropriate for indoor operations provided nuisance odors do not escape offsite. The following table breaks down the setbacks and minimum parcel size by land use category and cultivation type in the public hearing draft.

Industrial Hemp Processing and Manufacturing

Industrial hemp processing is treated as an agricultural processing use. It is limited to drying, curing, trimming, packaging, and preparing for further processing within a permanent building (not a hoop house or similar non-permanent structure). Industrial hemp processing is limited to land use categories where agricultural processing is allowed, and subject to discretionary review. Manufacturing of finished hemp products, including those products that require cannabinoid extraction and infusion, are classified under existing Industry, Manufacturing, and Processing uses according to their end product and scale of operations. For example, manufacturing of CBD infused chemical products would be considered Chemical Manufacturing, and hemp textiles would be classified as textile manufacturing etc.

Enforcement Violations of County Code or state law related to industrial hemp constitutes a public nuisance and is subject to code enforcement procedures. Industrial hemp crops are subject to review and inspection at any time, including crop and/or product testing by the Sheriff's Department, Code Enforcement, and Department of Agriculture/Weights and measures. If an industrial hemp crop were to test positive for THC content greater than that established under Section 81000 of the Food and Agricultural Code, the burden to remediate the situation would be on the applicant. Cannabis Hearing Officer duties and powers are proposed to be amended to include industrial hemp abatement hearings and determination of post-abatement costs and assessments.

Public Review Draft Comments

At the September 9, 2019 ALAB meeting it was recognized that although the Planning and Building Department needed to proceed with drafting the ordinance in order to return to the Board by Spring 2020, the subcommittee would continue with three subsequent monthly meetings to provide input on the drafting of the ordinance. Both the ALAB meetings and the subcommittee meeting were open for members of the public to attend and comment. The public review draft of the ordinance was released for public comment on November 11, 2019.
Revisions were made to the ordinance based on comments to the public review draft. Setbacks from religious facilities and cannabis grows were added to the location standards section. Per comments received from County Counsel, setbacks were required for industrial hemp transplants to avoid situations where Code Enforcement would not be able to distinguish between transplants and flowering cultivation until flowering had occurred; making it difficult to determine if there was a setback violation prior to flowering. The majority of comments advocated for changing the proposed setbacks, with the majority in favor of increased setbacks. Staff recognizes that

Page 6 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 86 of 348

Attachment 11 Planning Commission LUO, CZLUO, and Coastal Framework Amendment LRP2019-00008 County of SLO - Industrial Hemp Ordinance
Page 7

variability in temperature, wind, and size of grow can effect the distance at which odors would be detectable. The Planning Commission has the discretion to recommend a greater setback distance based on these comments. Response to public comments have been attached for reference.

GENERAL PLAN CONSIDERATIONS AND CONSISTENCY
The proposed amendment was reviewed for consistency with the General Plan and found to be consistent because they include revisions to protect the public safety, health and welfare by preventing the establishment of nuisances by the cultivation of industrial hemp, and they are consistent with the Land Use Ordinance Amendment guidelines in the General Plan.
Framework for Planning - Inland and Coastal Zone

The purpose of the following principles and goals are to better define and focus the County's proactive planning approach and balance environmental, economic, and social equity concerns.

Inland

Principle 1: Protect agricultural land and resources

Coastal Zone

Goal 1: Conserve agricultural resources and protect agricultural land

The proposed amendment would support and be consistent with the principles and goals. Industrial Hemp Cultivation is currently prohibited by the urgency ordinance. The proposed amendment would reduce barriers for Industrial Hemp Cultivation and establish cultivation standards for industrial hemp designed to reduce conflict with other uses. In addition, the County has formed and consulted with a technical advisory committee and considered public comments.

Agricultural Element

The intent of the Agricultural Element is to promote and protect the agricultural industry of the County, to provide for a continuing sound and healthy agriculture in the County, and to encourage a productive and profitable agricultural industry.
AG1: Support County Agricultural Production AG4: Encourage Public Education and Participation
In developing the draft ordinance, cultivation standards were developed to allow the cultivation of industrial hemp in areas and in a manner that lessens impacts to other crop types and uses. In addition, the ordinance was designed to allow for a registration process with no discretionary review to ensure processing procedures are rapid and efficient.

CEQA REVIEW
This project is covered by the common sense exemption that CEQA applies only to projects which have the potential for causing a significant effect on the environment. It can be seen with certainty

Page 7 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 87 of 348

Attachment 11
Planning Commission LUO, CZLUO, and Coastal Framework Amendment LRP2019-00008 County - of SLO - Industrial Hemp Ordinance
Page 8

that there is no possibility that this project may have a significant effect on the environment; therefore, the activity is not subject to CEQA. The proposed amendments to the Land Use Ordinance, Coastal Zone Land Use Ordinance, and County General Plan place restrictions on the cultivation of industrial hemp crops. Crop production and grazing is currently an allowed use within the County of San Luis Obispo.

REFERRALS
The proposed amendments were referred to: Public Works, Cal Fire, County Environmental Health, City of San Luis Obispo, City of Arroyo Grande, City of Paso Robles, City of Atascadero, City of Pismo Beach, Community Advisory Groups, Air Pollution Control District, California
Coastal Commission, Farm Bureau, neighboring counties, California Coastal Commission, California Department of Fish and Wildlife, US Department of Fish and Wildlife, RWQCB, California Department of Conservation, Agricultural Liaison Advisory Board, and the interested parties e-mail list. Staff received comment letters from various groups and individuals, which are included in the attached Response to Comments.

SB18
Pursuant to the requirements of Senate Bill 18 (SB 18 - 2004), any County that considers a
General Plan Amendment must invite representatives from affected local tribes to participate in meaningful consultation with the local government for the purpose of discussing tribal concerns related to the proposed project. SB 18 consultation was initiated for the proposed amendments in October 2019. No requests for consultation were received.

ATTACHMENTS
The following attachments include all of the required documentation for amendments to the Local Coastal Plan and County Code to establish Industrial Hemp Cultivation. The proposed amendments are in legislative change format. Following the Planning Commission hearing on this item, the applicable draft resolution language will be prepared/ revised for the Board's review.

EXHIBIT A- FINDINGS
Environmental Determination

A. This project is covered by the common sense exemption that CEQA applies only to projects which have the potential for causing a significant effect on the environment. It
can be seen with certainty that there is no possibillty that this project may have a significant effect on the environment; therefore, the activity is not subject to CEQA. The proposed
amendments to the Land Use Ordinance, Coastal Zone Land Use Ordinance, and County General Plan place restrictions on the cultivation of industrial hemp crops. Crop
production and grazing is currently an allowed use within the County of San Luis Obispo.

Amendment
B. The proposed amendments are consistent with the Land Use Element and other adopted elements of the County General Plan the proposed amendment would reduce barriers for Industrial Hemp Cultivation and establish cultivation standards for Industrial hemp designed to reduce conflict with other uses.

C. The proposed amendments are consistent with the guidelines for amendments to the Land
Use Ordinance because the amendments are minor in nature and are intended to allow
the cultivation of a Federally legal crop.

D. The proposed amendments will protect the publlc health, safety and welfare of the area residents by placing restrictions on Industrial Hemp Cultivation and processing that are intended to minimize conflict with other crops and land uses.

ALAB recommends that County Planning consider the implementation of a
sliding scale for setback requirements based upon the number of industrial hemp acres being cultivated.
Although ALAB could not come to consensus on exactly what those setback distances should be, it was agreed
that it is logical to require smaller setback distances from smaller sized growing sites, relative to the acreage of
the hemp growing site.

In Section 22.30.244 (B.)1.c: ALAB recommends that riparian and wetland setbacks be struck from the ordinance due to this requirement being duplicative of existing requirements from other agencies that growers must
already meet.
ALAB recommends that direction is given to the Agricultural Commissioner's Office to develop : set of
recommended and/or required Best Management Practices (BMP's) for the cultivation of industrial hemp
locally. Once these BMP's are developed, ALAB recommends that consideration is given toward incorporating
those BMP's into the industrial hemp registration process conducted by the Agricultural Commissioner's Office.
ALAB strongly recommends that as new research on the potential impacts of hemp cultivation (and processing) becomes available that this new scientific information is examined in the context of any permanent hemp
ordinance that is enacted by the county. ALAB recommends that this review occur annually, and the permanent
hemp ordinance be amended to reflect new research information and associated impacts, if necessary and/or
warranted.

Thank you for your consideration of these recommendations.

TO: San Luis Obispo County Planning & Building Department

FROM: San Luis Obispo County Department of Agriculture

DATE: December 19, 2019

SUBJECT: Comments and recommendations on the Public Review Draft of the Industrial Hemp
Ordinance

Thank you for the opportunity to comment. The Department of Agriculture appreciates your efforts in
putting together this Public Review Draft of the Industrial Hemp Ordinance. We appreciate the
straightforward approach and easily understandable ordinance that has been drafted; however, we do
have four topics that we would like comment on and bring to your attention.

Section 22.30.244 (B) 1. A - Outdoor Industrial Hemp: "Tasting rooms" definition "Tasting rooms" is not defined within this ordinance. We could not find anywhere else in local land use code that the term was defined. If "tasting rooms" is not defined in the hemp
ordinance, or in another section of local land use ordinance, we recommend that "tasting rooms" be defined for the sake of clarity.

Section 22.30.244 (B) 1. A - Outdoor Industrial Hemp: Setback established from other crop production
With the passage of the 2018 Federal Farm Bill, industrial hemp was classified as an agricultural commodity and removed from the Controlled Substances Act list. Although we recognize that industrial hemp is a unique crop, placing setback requirements from other types of crop production on a legal crop would be an unprecedented step. We submit that setbacks could be modified, by waiver, to address unique, crop-to-crop situations, as current agricultural practices in our area indicate that neighboring growers of different crops can coexist with much smaller
distances separating their crops than the 300-foot distance that is currently proposed.
This 300-foot setback requirement from other crop production could result in an unnecessary prohibition on cultivating a legal crop even in instances where the adjacent existing grower does not believe there is a need for a setback. For instance, we are aware of several examples
of registered industrial hemp growers who cultivated legally within San Luis Obispo County in 2019, who would be impacted by this requirement due to nearby crop production on an adjacent parcel. In at least one of those instances, the neighboring grower has no concern with the industrial hemp cultivation. We suggest exploring a mechanism where the adjacent grower
could provide a waiver that would remove this setback requirement for the industrial hemp grower if the adjacent grower did not have any concerns or did not see any need for a 300-foot separation.

Attachment 11

Section 22.30.244 (B) 1. A - Outdoor Industrial Hemp: Potential for a sliding scale on setback
requirements
Similar to the recommendation made by the Agricultural Liaison Advisory Board (ALAB) in their
letter from December 18, 2019, our department also sees the logic and value in having any
setbacks that are established utilize a sliding scale based upon the number of industrial hemp
acres being cultivated (e.g. if it is decided that setbacks are necessary, those setback distances
could be established on a sliding scale for cultivation sites under 1 acre, less than 10 acres, and greater than 10 acres with smaller setback distances established for the smaller acreage
categories). Not only does it make logical sense to have smaller setback requirements for
smaller cultivation sites, that concept also aligns with the goals set out in AGP4 of the County's
Agriculture Element - Agricultural Use of Small Parcels, which encourages agricultural uses on
small agriculturally zoned parcels as appropriate and allowable.

It is important to recognize that many of the growers interested in cultivating industrial hemp in San Luis Obispo County may be smaller growers. As evidence to this point, 10 of the 16
commercial hemp growers that were registered in 2019 prior to the passage of the temporary
moratorium grew acres or less; 7 of those 10 growers cultivated only 2 acres or less. With the
potential value of CBD hemp, these smaller cultivation sites may provide a tremendous
economic opportunity for local growers that may not have many other options for viable agricultural production at their growing locations.

Section 22.30.244 (B) 2 - Nuisance Odors: Potential Enforcement
The Department of Agriculture is responsible for the enforcement of industrial hemp laws as
established in the California Food & Agricultural Code, as well as associated industrial hemp regulations within the California Code of Regulations. However, our Department does not typically have any authority over local land use ordinance statutes.

We are seeking clarification on who would enforce this section, specifically in regard to the
statement "All structures. shall be equipped.....to eliminate nuisance odor emissions from
being detected offsite." Growers who fail to eliminate these nuisance odors could be in full
compliance with state Food & Agricultural Code requirements, so is this strictly a County Code
Enforcement responsibility?

SUBJECT: APCD Comments Regarding the SLO County Industrial Hemp Ordinance
Draft

Dear Mr. Morais:

Thank you giving the San Luis Obispo County Air Pollution Control District (APCD) an
opportunity to comment on the San Luis Obispo County Industrial Hemp Ordinance Draft
(Draft). The Draft defined cultivation, processing and manufacturing as follows:

Industrial Hemp Cultivation
Industrial Hemp Cultivation will be considered a subcategory of Crop Production
and Grazing subject to specific land use requirements, but not requiring
discretionary review (pg. 2). The definition of Industrial Hemp Cultivation is defined on page 13 and states any activity involving the planting, growing, harvesting, or field drying of industrial
hemp.
Industrial Hemp Cultivation will be limited to the Agriculture, Rural Lands, and
Residential Rural land use categories (pg. 2).
Indoor Industrial Hemp Cultivation does not include cultivation within a hoop
structure, only within a permanent structure using a combination of natural light, light deprivation, and/or artificial lighting (pg.13).

Industrial Hemp Processing
Industrial Hemp Processing will be treated as an Agricultural Processing use and
will require discretionary review (pg. 2). Indoor Industrial Hemp Processing. The drying, curing, trimming, packaging and preparing for further processing within a permanent building (not a hoop house or similar non-permanent structure); considered an agricultural processing use
(pg.13).

Page 2 of 3

Industrial Hemp Manufacturing
Manufacturing of hemp products will be classified under existing manufacturing uses according to end-product and scale of operations and subject to permitting requirements accordingly (pg.13).
Industrial hemp processing does not include cannabinoid extraction and infusion and
manufacturing of finished products. Finished hemp products are classified under existing
Industry, Manufacturing, and Processing uses according to their end-product and scale of
operations. For example, manufacturing of CBD infused chemical products would be
considered Chemical Manufacturing, hemp cloth manufacturing would be classified as Textile Manufacturing etc. (pg. 14).

The following APCD comments are pertinent to the Draft Ordinance.

The industrial hemp manufacturing requirements described in Paragraph D. 5. Industrial Hemp Processing on page 14, are unclear. The paragraph briefly explains that industrial hemp processing would be subject to permitting requirements based on the "finished hemp products" but does not explain more than two categories of products and what permitting requirements they are subject to.
In reference to SLO County Ordinance 23.06.082 - Air Pollution Control District (APCD) Review, it is
important to convey that manufacturing processes will be subject to other agency discretion, including, but not limited to the APCD, SLO County Environmental Health, and SLO County Fire
Department.

Similarly, to the Cannabis Permitting Guide webpage on the SLO County's website, the APCD would like to be a "recommended" agency during the application process because Industrial Hemp cultivation/processing/manufacturing is subject to various APCD permits and rules.

To be as transparent as possible to applicants, the APCD would like the following information
conveyed to applicants:

Permit - Agricultural Burning
Since Industrial Hemp Cultivation will be considered a subcategory of Crop Production and Grazing,
burning of Industrial Hemp waste will require an APCD Agricultural Burn Permit and burning of
waste is only allowed on Permissive Burn Days. All agricultural burning is subject to APCD Rule 502.
Verification of THC content may be required upon application. For more information on agricultural burning, visit the following APCD webpage: slocleanair.org/rules-regulations/agriculture/burning.

Permit - Manufacturing & Masking/Neutralizing of Hemp
The following are subject to the APCD's permitting requirements: All industrial hemp manufacturing facilities.
All masking/neutralizing agents used to control or eliminate odors related to the growing
and/or manufacturing/processing of hemp.

Nuisance - Manufacturing & Masking/Neutralizing of Hemp
The following are subject to the APCD's Nuisance Rule 402 and may result in enforcement action:
Verified nuisance odors from manufacturing.
Verified nuisance odors from masking/neutralizing agents used to control or eliminate odors
related to the growing and/or manufacturing of hemp.

Dear Supevisors:

Please find the following input from the Creston Advisory Body (CAB) with regards to the hemp ordinance that is
currently being drafted by San Luis Obispo County.

HEMP DISCUSSION AND PROPOSAL FROM CRESTON ADVISORY BOARD

THE PROBLEM(S)

Applications for permits to build facilities to grow and process hemp are increasing at an alarming rate throughout SLO County and the State. The Applicants are typically non-resident owners interested in our land
and water for the sole purpose of profit and no consideration for our communities. There is no interest in
protecting the quality of life we experience here in the Central Coast.

Recently, at a Creston Advisory Board (CAB) meeting Supervisor Debbie Arnold informed us the Board
of Supervisors had declared a temporary moratorium on the cultivation of industrial hemp within the
unincorporated areas of San Luis Obispo county while the County staff determines the impact of such
unregulated cultivation and develops reasonable regulations to mitigate such impacts. This was good news to
those in attendance but it was clear this was the beginning of another push by hemp growers getting underway. Everyone in attendance expressed concerns that this was very similar to the cannabis problem except hemp does not require approval to grow, making planting easier than for cannabis. The real problem is hemp is : strain of cannabis and contains both THC and CBD the two main active ingredients in cannabis yet hemp growth
is non-regulated. Supervisor Arnold also stated that a specific lab must do the testing to determine whether a
plant was cannabis or hemp. Only the lower THC concentration seen in hemp distinguishes it from cannabis
(i.e., less than 0.3 % THC based on dry weight). In fact, hemp has been raised for years for making rope, etc.
without isolating the active ingredients. However, now a new generation of hemp growers are growing hemp to
extract and utilize the active ingredient CBD illegally. In short, hemp is cannabis with a lower THC level and
should be treated as such. Additionally recent news articles have reported that grows have been found that are labelled as hemp, are actually marijuana grows attempting to forego the licensing process.

There was no one in the sizeable crowd at the CAB meeting who was in favor of allowing hemp nor has
the CAB received any community support expressing support to be grown in Creston or the Creston community.

Attachment 11

The same response was seen during cannabis application reviews. First and foremost, the Creston landowners, residents and nelghbors made it quite clear that hemp growth and processing operations are not compatible with the community and are not wanted. They know that such operations present e dear and present danger to the people who live here and to our country lifestyle, not to mention our investments in our land, our homes and our families. Here are some specifics which would apply equally to where you live.

1. Safety - Creston's residents are concerned, first and foremost, for the safety of thelr families and the sanctity of their homes. As anyone can grow hemp, as the law reads currently, it could be grown
anywhere In our community and surrounding area. The residents' safety and that of their children would
potentially be under threats to health, crime and otherwise by a single hemp farm or multiple hemp
farms. Again, recent news reports of an attempted robbery of a Templeton "hemp" grow due to the
burglars believing it was actually marijuana, is a real example of our concern.
Potential mitigation:
At a minimum, residential dwelling units should be included in the county ordinance "sensitive receptor"
definition with at least a 1,000 foot setback. The county ordinance for pig farm/cattle feed lot has 1,000 foot residential dwelling setback and 1 mile setback from residential areas. Rural residential
homes should have the same protection from hemp, and cannabis.

. Environmental Impact - These operations most certainly increase the risks not only to the quiet
lifestyle we enjoy but also to our immediate environment. It was acknowledged that several dangerous volatile chemicals and explosively flammable gases would be used as part of hemp
extraction or processing. We were informed that such hazardous materials are not allowed for an operatlon this close to town, homes and schools because of the potential risks of injurles or deaths.
These chemicals may present other risks as well, In the event of spills or mishandling, of contamination of nearby soils, the surface and underground drinking water supplies across the Paso Robles
Groundwater Basin, including the nearby Huero Huero River along with other creeks and streams
whose course runs on or adjacent to a growth site. All residences in the Creston community are on wells and are therefore highly susceptible if contamination should occur.

Potential mitigation -

Keep the cultivation of cannabis/hemp indoors, and limited to sealed greenhouses that do not vent to
the atmosphere.

This will limit the impact of air pollution/skunk odor but not completely - do not allow for chemical
sprays that cover the plant odors. Outdoor grows can not mitigate the resulting air pollution/skunk
odors. Put outdoor grows at least 1 mile away from residential neighborhoods just like the pig farm
setback ordinance. Do not allow what is essentially Industrial manufacturing/processing on lands
zoned as agricultural or near rural residences.
Require compllance with the Callfornia Environmental Quality Act (CEQA).

End the undue exemptions given to cannabis projects. Hemp as an "agriculture product" must undergo
CEQA review, studies and reports for a given project location so should cannabis since it is the same

Attachment 11

plant.

Eliminate all types of potential pollution
It was acknowledged that these operations can result in night-time light pollution, Increased truck and other vehicular traffic, Increased noise levels, escaping chemicals, hemp plant and production odors.

3. Crime

Hemp growers have historically argued that they are "ust another ag. operation", similar to growing ollves, alfalfa or grapes and should be viewed and treated the same way. But that patently is not true. These hemp operations definitely not Just "ag." operations. The risk of a significant increase in crime in and around Creston would be a legitimate concern. This risk has been acknowledged by the
County.

Potential mitigation -

Requirements that hemp growth and operations must undergo thorough criminal background
checks and operations must have 24 hr. camera surveillance and a security person, The concern about
increased crime is real, particularly since law enforcement response times are necessarlly longer in rural areas like Creston. The now negligible crime rates in Creston area seem almost certain to skyrocket, if hemp growth is approved.

4. Economic Damages

A rural residential area like Creston embedded with and surrounded by hemp growth and operations
would result in lower property values and other economic damage to the families who live and work
here. For most citizens their investments in their homes will be the largest investments of their lives
and these investments would most certainly be damaged. At least one property in Creston went on the market the moment there was an application submitted to the County and discussion of a "grow" on the property next door. The interest by potential buyers has been less than enthuslastic once the potential "grow" was disclosed.
A further, very real, concern for Creston citizen owners of homes and traditional ag. properties, beyond the previously mentioned inherent reduction of our properties' re-sale values if they were to be situated
near a cannabis/hemp grow or processing operations, would now include the high risks of court and attorneys' fees and costs of pursuing or defending related (and already threatened) property rights
litigations. The Creston community is united in simply wanting to keep they homes and lifestyles they
have invested in. None should have to be exposed to threats by the cannabis/hemp industry of, or
actually suffer, the financial risks and stress of having to protect ourselves from corporate aggressions and profit motive manipulations. No one purchased their property accepting of the idea that there might be a hemp, or cannabis, operation next door. In no rational sense would these operations be compatible with our community.
In addition, it has been shown there are Issues with cannabis/hemp endangering our wine crops which
are key economic contributors to our area. This has been proven in a number of areas with references
given below. In fact, Napa supervisors prepare to ban cultivation, manufacturing, and sale of commercial
cannabis in unincorporated Napa County, recently.

Page 56 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 136 of 348

Attachment 11

The question of water usage Is always of concern as our community sits over the Paso Robles
Groundwater Basln. It is our understanding that hemp requires more water per acre than grapes and
although we've been told that any hemp grower would have to obtain agricultural offsets, both the agriculturists In our area and the local residents have concerns. At this point in time, it is our
understanding that offsets can be obtained from anywhere over the basin, however if hemp is grown in
our community it is clear that the pumping will be occurring in our immediate area of the basin thereby
impacting the many relatively shallow rural residential wells we have in our community and jeopardizing
the family welfare of our residents.

5. Gray area

The majority of hemp being grown now is for the extraction of CBD oil, to be used both for recreational and therapeutic purposes (medicinal In nature), however it was delisted as a Class I, scheduled controlled substance" by the FDA in the 2018 Farm Bill, meaning a prescription by a doctor is no longer required. (i.e.,
proof of legitimate existing market sources for CBD). It is therefore not a "traditional" type of agricultural crop.
Hemp is currently operating In gray area of the law since it is not categorized as being used as a drug.
Since the CBD oil from hemp is used as : medicine, hemp profits need to be taxed by the county as is cannabis
to remove incentives to sell "bad" hemp crops (i.e., having more THC than allowed). There also needs to be
penalties paid to the county for "bad" hemp crops since technically they need to be destroyed.

A POSSIBLE WAY FORWARD

Since the county currently has a moratorium on the cultivation of industrlal hemp operations within the unincorporated areas of SLO county, we have time to establish and set up proper regulations which protects the
public safety health and welfare of Creston and the surrounding community. The sensible, proper and most economic decision for the County on these hemp growth operations should be to simply establish these new hemp regulations before hemp growth takes off. It has been shown the county has moved too fast in allowing
cannabls growth to establish itself. So, for hemp growth/ operations let's take our time, put together appropriate regulations by a group made up of both county employees, hemp growers AND county citizens to
regulate hemp growth.

One possible idea would be to establish a new "industrial hemp ag" zoning ordinance. It would require that
these "hemp growth/factory ag." operation be located away from residential, residential ag. and pure ag areas.
In fact, the same should be done with cannabis growth.

The truth is, these operations ARE factories and should be zoned accordingly. Their "grows" should be indoors and the processing is done indoors. So, one could arguably say that these operations should be kept
away from our towns, our schools, our families and prevented from imposing any health or safety risks upon
us. They should be co-located in a specially zoned "hemp industrial park", which would result in benefits to the
taxpayers. In short, put manufacturing where It belongs in Industrial or Commercial Zoned land.

1. Certainly, it would make the County's application reviews, permit issuance and periodic inspections
easier more efficient and less costly, with the sites localized in one place. Fewer personnel would be required,
less travel time from property to property and fewer hours needed for inspections or follow ups. And, finally, no
further concerns as to whether the zoning for a new operation is correct, no more strings of hearings and debates and waste of County admInlstrative time and maney.

Page 57 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 137 of 348

Attachment 11

2. Law enforcement oversight and/or patrol for criminal activities would be easier, less costly and
more efficient with all of the legal operations in one factory-ag zone. Law enforcement response times would be reduced, the burden on law enforcement agencies for monitoring hemp/cannabis related criminal activities reduced and the number of officers and costs needed to patrol would be reduced dramatically.

A win for the County administrative staff and budgets, law enforcement's personnel and budgets and, most importantly, the tax-payers and the safety of their families, their health and their homes,

SUMMARY

It is not surprising that communities like ours find it difficult to not lump cannabis and hemp together regardless of their legal classifications. They are essentially the same plant and thus need to be handled similarly in an agriculturally dominate, family oriented community like Creston. Adopting the following would go a long way towards minimizing the conflicts between rural residents and cannabls/hemp projects being
proposed across the county and in our community specifically:

2 Establish a new "Industrial hemp ag" zoning ordinance.
G Eliminate any type of industrial manufacturing on Agricultural Zoned land.
8 Include residential dwelling units in the "sensitive receptor" definition and site restrictions.
E Keep the cultivation of cannabis/hemp indoors and limited to sealed facilities and greenhouses that
do not vent to the atmosphere.
F Require compllance with the Callfornia Environmental Quality Act - do not give exemptions to
cannabis projects.

Cannabis/hemp projects are NOT traditional agriculture for SLO County - these are nuisance crops.
Cannabis is incompatible with traditional agriculture due to the risks of pesticide and non-pestlcide grows - the
proximity of cannabis/hemp to traditional agriculture is not compatible.
Cannabis/hemp projects are not compatible with our town of Creston and local residential agriculture
quality of life. Do not force the Santa Barbara County cannabls/hemp un-restricted grows on to San Luis Obispo
County residential agriculture neighborhoods, homes and families.

Respectfully submitted:

Shella Lyons, CAB Chairperson

Re: County of San Luis Obispo Industrial Hemp Ordinance Public Review Draft
Dear Planning and Building Department:
The Grower-Shipper Association of Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties represents over 170 growers, shippers, farm labor contractors, and supporting agribusinesses. Our members grow diverse field and nursery crops such as broccoli, strawberries, wine grapes, vegetable transplants, flowers, and tree fruit. We appreciate
the opportunity to comment on the County's consideration of a permanent ordinance regarding industrial hemp cultivation. Our Board of Directors voted unanimously to submit this comment letter.
The Association advocates for thoughtful policy that anticipates and minimizes predictable land use conflicts. Our members have experienced similar conflicts with both hemp and cannabis (marijuana). Both hemp and cannabis cultivation have been the source of significant conflict with established Central Coast agriculture.

Based on the best information we have available and the extent of conflict that our members and others in
the agricultural community have experienced in trying to grow near hemp and cannabis, we do not believe
that hemp or cannabis cultivation is compatible with organic or conventional Central Coast agriculture.
Our Board of Directors and members have engaged in extensive, focused discussions since August. These extensive discussions and the experience of our members growing in close proximity to hemp and cannabis through a full production cycle have better informed our current policy position. We have actively engaged on this issue by participating in discussions with the Agricultural Liaison Advisory Board (ALAB) and the ALAB
Hemp Subcommittee, although we disagree with the recommendations favored by the majority of ALAB because we do not believe that it is adequately protective of the greater agricultural community.
Our policy position has evolved as we have become better informed on the specifics of hemp cultivation, end uses, regulatory context, and experience of nearby agricultural operations. The Association believes in the value
of a diverse, vibrant, and robust agricultural economy and communities and we support different types of Central Coast agriculture. We further believe that innovation and adaptation is essential to support agriculture and allow for future generations to continue to be viable in domestic agriculture in the face of increasing challenges related
to labor, water, market, and the cumulative effect of regulatory and economic pressures. For these reasons we E are open to opportunities that complement and secure a future for agriculture on the Central Coast and are mindful
of the potential precedential implications of policy decisions. However, based on the experience of our
members operating in real-world Central Coast conditions, all evidence suggests that hemp is not
similarly situated agricultural crop and these differences are driving severe conflicts.

Hemp and cannabis are fundamentally different from other agricultural crops. Unlike any other crop, hemp and
cannabis have demonstrated that it is virtually impossible to farm next to even when exercising best management
practices in a manner consistent with proper and accepted customs and standards and local, State, and Federal
rules and regulations.

Our members have reported conflicts with neighbors growing both hemp and/or cannabis a in a variety of crops in and locations in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo Counties. The conflicts that our members have experienced are not isolated to one particular location, individual, or crop type. Although there are some limited locations that have not generated conflict, the majority of our members operating near hemp and/or cannabis have experienced significant and acrimonious conflict. The types of conflict include disputes over normal cultivation activities, such as land cultivation, application of plant protection materials, application of fertilizers, and threatened litigation; other conflicts have included harvest crews reporting concerns from strong odors sometimes several miles away. Crop types that have been embroiled in conflicts have included broccoli, wine grapes, avocado orchards, and citrus orchards. Local businesses and community members that have been impacted by this conflict include farmers, harvesters, rural residents, shippers, custom machine operators, materials applicators, and farm labor contractors. Given the great extent and diversity of intrinsic conflicts, we restate that these experiences of conflict are not isolated events and should give pause to the future of hemp and cannabis cultivation on the Central Coast.

Although the significance of advocating for regulations weighs heavily on our Association, we cannot remain silent in the face of continued increases in the number of members whose ability to exercise best management practices is crippled by their proximity to hemp or cannabis cultivation.
Until we have evidence to the contrary we urge a conservative approach be exercised to maintain the viability of the established, diverse agriculture and a future for food crops on the Central Coast. Examples of policy and
information gaps include broader State and Federal licensing of plant protection materials for hemp cultivation, better understanding of odor concemns, and if and how the extreme levels of intolerance for regulatory testing parameters for cannabis will be applied to hemp. We further believe that addressing liability protection for agriculturalists exercising best agricultural practices and their right to farm is a key component for compatibility between hemp and other agricultural food crops.

We hope that the Board of Supervisors reconsiders its direction in developing an Industrial Hemp Ordinance in light of this information and considers the widespread and significant conflicts that hemp and cannabis cultivation have generated on the Central Coast demonstrating their incompatibility with existing food crops in San Luis
Obispo County.

Sincerely,
Claire. Limsmay

Subject: County of San Luis Obispo Industrial Hemp Ordinance Public Review Draft (Ordinance)

Dear Mr. Morais:

The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (Department) has received a copy of the draft County of San Luis Obispo Industrial Hemp Ordinance. The draft Ordinance addresses cultivation, processing, manufacturing, and in the field sales of hemp in the unincorporated San Luis Obispo County (County) jurisdiction.
Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments and recommendations regarding those activities involved in the Ordinance that may affect California fish and wildlife. Likewise, CDFW appreciates the opportunity to provide comments regarding those aspects of the Ordinance the Department, by law, may be required to carry out or approve through the exercise of its own regulatory authority under Fish and Game Code (FGC).
As defined in the Ordinance, Section 4, Section 22.30.070, industrial hemp processing is only allowed in the Agriculture (AG), Rural Lands (RL), Commercial Service (CS), Residential Rural (RR), and Industrial (IND) land use categories. As defined in the Ordinance. Section 4, Section 22.30.244, industrial hemp cultivation (indoor and outdoor) may be allowed in the AG, RL, and RR land use categories only; outdoor industrial hemp cultivation is limited to sites of iS ten (10) acres or larger; indoor industrial hemp cultivation is limited to sites of five (5) acres or larger; outdoor industrial hemp cultivation in the RR land use category is limited to production of industrial hemp transplants only.

THE DEPARTMENT ROLE

The Department is California's Trustee Agency for fish and wildlife resources and holds those resources in trust by statue for all the people of the State (Fish & G. Code. §S 711.7, subd. (a) & 1802; Pub. Resources Code, § 21070; CEQA Guidelines § 15386, subd. (a)). The Department, in its trustee capacity, has jurisdiction over the conservation, protection, and management of fish, wildlife, native plants, and habitat necessary for biologically sustainable populations of those species (ld., § 1802).

COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The Ordinance applies to all of San Luis Obispo (SLO) County which has been identified to contain thousands of acres of protected conservation lands, core population areas for multiple State and federally listed species and supports rare natural communities. The County includes the only known habitat for many special status species and important geographic and topographic habitat areas that have been identified as critical to meet the recovery goals for many State and federally listed species.

The Department is concerned the Ordinance, as drafted, could result in impacts to both unlisted and special status species known to occur in the County, including but not limited to, the special status species listed in the Table 1 and 2. The Department's recommendations are Included below to minimize impacts to fish and wildlife resources and their habitat.

Responsible Agency Authority: The Department has regulatory authority over projects that could result in the "take" of any specles listed by the State as threatened or endangered, pursuant to FGC section 2081. If a project could result in take of any species listed as threatened or endangered under the Califomnia Endangered Species Act (CESA), the Department may need to issue a State Incidental Take Permit (ITP) for the Project.
The Department disagrees that industrial hemp cultivation should be a subcategory of Crop Production and Grazing subject to specific land use requirements, making hemp cuitivation a part of the ministerial permitting process, but not requiring discretionary review.

Hemp activities have the potential to reduce the number or restrict the range of endangered, rare, or threatened species (as defined in § 15380 of CEQA). The Department recommends the County remove industrial hemp cultivation from the ministerial permitting process and require discretionary review, thus prompting the County to determine if the project is exempt under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). CEQA requires a Mandatory Finding of Significance if a project is likely to substantially impact threatened or endangered species ($5 21001(c), 21083, Guidelines §S 15380, 15064, 15065). Impacts must be avoided or mitigated to less than significant levels unless the CEQA Lead Agency makes and supports a Statement of Overriding Consideration (SOC). The CEQA Lead Agency's SOC does not oliminate the Project proponent's obligation to comply with FGC section 2080 and would preciude the Department from utilizing the CEQA document to support ITP issuance. If the Lead Agency chooses not to mitigate impacts to CESA-listed species to less than significant levels, then the Department would become CEQA Lead Agency for ITP issuance, which would result in delays and additional costs to applicants. If there is no CEQA document and the project proponent seeks acquisition of an ITP, pursuant to FGC section 2081(b), the Department would become CEQA Lead Agency for ITP issuance. Furthermore, the issuance of an Exemption or Negative Declaration would preclude the Department from utilizing the CEQA document to support ITP issuance. If the Lead Agency proceeds with an Exemption or Negative Declaration, then the Department would become CEQA Lead Agency for ITP issuance.
Land Conversion: Not all parcels zoned Agriculture, Commercial Service, Residential Rural and Industrial have been developed. Many parcels meeting the land use categories for hemp cultivation or processing are undeveloped and potentially contain suitable habitat and special status species, specifically in the Carrizo Plain. Land conversion may result in habitat loss for special status species, migration/movement coridor limitations, or fragmentation of sensitive habitat. Loss of habitat to development to and agriculture are contributing factors to the decline of many special status species and game specjes.

To further ensure that important fish and wildlife resources are not lost due to hemp cultivation, the Department recommends limiting hemp cultivation and processing to a "Previously Disturbed Area", following is a potential definition. The Department would like to discuss with County staff whether this definition would accomplish our common goals of avoiding new habitat conversjons and significant impacts to wildlife due to hemp cultivation and processing: "An area which legally underwent clearing, grubbing, grading, or disturbances to the ground such as stockpiling or excavation as of August 23, 2016. The extent and intensity of the disturbance must be such that County-approved biologists can readily verify that no rare, threatened, or endangered species occupy the site and that hemp cultivation would not cause impacts to rare, threatened, or endangered species." Some cases may require a qualified biologist to visit the site to make such a determination.

Many areas that have been previously farmed, or graded, filled, or otherwise disturbed in the County support fish and wildlife resources, including special status species. For example, most of the Carrizo Plain was cultivated in the past but has been recolonized by multiple special status species. Even recently and currently cultivated lands there support special status species. Coastal prairles in the North Coast Plan Area and other grasslands throughout the County have also mostly been tilled or farmed in the past, in yet they support special status plants and animals. Areas on the Nipomo Mesa and elsewhere in the South County that have been "previously disturbed" support Pismo clarkia, which is a State rare and federal endangered species.
Carrizo Planning Area: Carrizo Plain is unique within the County. Located in southeast SLO County, Carrizo Plain S bounded by the Temblor Range to the east, Caliente Range to the west, and contains the Carrizo National Monument. Carrizo Plain is home to multiple special status species, including the fully protected blunt-nosed leopard lizard, San Joaquin kit fox, giant kangaroo rat, San Joaquin antelope squirrel and tricolored blackbird, and important game species such as pronghorn (Antelocapra americana) and tule elk (Cervus elaphus).
Hemp cultivation is incompatible with the fish and wildlife resources that occur in the Carrizo Planning Area. The Carrizo Planning Area harbors the highest concentration of special status species in California, contains designated Critical Habitat, and provides core habitat essential to the recovery of species listed under both the Federal and California Endangered Species Acts. The Department has observed directly that cannabis cultivation has disturbed and displaced habitat for these species in the Carrizo Planning Area, exposed listed species to poisoning, and likely resulted in unlawful take of listed species. These observations were documented in letters to the County dated September 8 and October 31, 2016 and March 6, 2017. It is reasonable to conclude .. ....
allowing hemp cultivation and processing in the Carrizo Planning Area would have similar effects on the Critical Habitat and special status species in the area. The •. FS 1 •

Department recommends the County prohibit hemp cultivation and processing in the Carrizo Planning Area.
Riparlan Habitat, Weflands, and Watercourses: The Department concurs with the County's hemp cultivation setbacks of at least 50 feet from the upland extent of riparian vegetation of any watercourse and 100 feet from any wetland. Riparian habitat, wetlands, and watercourses are of extreme importance to a wide variety of plant and wildlife species. Riparian habitat, wetlands, and watercourses are known to exist within the County, including historic seeping from the earth lined canals, shallow first encountered groundwater, and along natural and human made watercourses. The Department considers projects that impact these resources as significant if they result in a net loss of acreage or habitat value. The Department has a no-net-loss policy regarding impacts to wetlands. When wetland habitat cannot be avoided, the Department recommends that impacts to wetlands be compensated with the creation of new habitat, preferably on-site, at a minimum of an acre-for-acre basis. Wetlands that have been inadvertently created by leaks, dams or other structures, or failures in man-made water systems are not exempt from this policy. In addition, the Department recommends a delineation be conducted for proposed Projects to assess riparian, wetland, and watercourse impacts to guide project proponents in establishing
... appropriate no-disturbance buffers.
Enforcement: The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) is the licensing authority for the State for commercial cannabis cultivation. CDFA and the Department are members of a multi-agency task force created to protect the State's resources from the adverse Impacts of cannabis cultivation (Fish & G. Code, § 12029). Like cannabis cultivation, hemp cultivation has the potential to affect fish, wildlife, plants, and their habitats. Cannabis inspections have led to violations for water diversions and storage, grading, chemical use, wildlife threats, timber conversion, and public safety. The Department's Law Enforcement Division (LED) is a critical component of enforcement. The Department's LED works with cannabis cultivators to bring their facilities into compliance, aids in remediating criminal environmental violations, coordinates with other agencies to remove illegal grows, growers, illegal water impoundments, and extremely toxic chemicals frequently associated with illegal grows, and protects California's unique and diverse natural resources.
The Department recommends amending the inspections section to read as follows: "All industrial hemp operations in the unincorporated territory of San Luis Obispo County are subject to review and inspection at any time, without notice, including crop and/or product testing by agents of the County of San Luis Obispo Sheriff's Department, Code Enforcement, The California Department of Fish and Wildlife, California Peace Officers and Department of Agriculture/Weights and Measures."

Re: County of San Luis Obispo Industrial Hemp Ordinance Public Review Draft
San Luis Obispo County Farm Bureau represents all of the farmers, ranchers and agribusinesses that make up our $2.5 billion-dollar county agricultural economy. Like all policy issues, our positions on
industrial hemp must reflect our members' diverse perspectives. Our 800 members include hemp and
cannabis growers, retailers, rural residents opposed to all cannabis, wine grape growers, and farmers
raising other commodities. Since the Urgency Ordinance was passed on June 18, 2019, Farm Burcau has tried to find common ground between stakeholders on this difficult issue both within our membership and through the Agricultural Liaison Advisory Board. Our comments here are to help guide County staff, Planning Commissioners and Supervisors to fairly understand industrial hemp issues and to make this ordinance workable for San Luis Obispo County.
is Our principal objective is to preserve our freedom to farm, not to farm any one particular crop. We must prioritize protecting our largest commodity (wine grapes), while being mindful of how any protections
enacted today could jeopardize all farmers down the road. We also have responsibility to attract new people to agriculture and afford smaller farms an opportunity to make a living off of a small amount of land. Industrial hemp has this potential, but sadly, the County's enactment of a temporary moratorium
during the 2019 growing season, coupled with the rapidly evolving nature of this new U.S. hemp
market, means a potentially lucrative new ag commodity will likely pass San Luis Obispo by. Nonetheless, we are committed to finding path forward for hemp in SLO County.
Our members have identified three primary issues of concern with industrial bemp, including: Odors from hemp cultivation being a nuisance to neighboring residences or businesses; Possible contamination of wine grapes by compounds present in the odor emitted by hemp and cannabis (compounds known as terpenes); and Legal liability from contaminating hemp and cannabis with pesticides used in neighboring crop fields for non-hemp or cannabis crops.

Issue 1: Odor
First, any setback on a federally legal agricultural crop is a dangerous precedent for all of agriculture. If odors from ag crops are categorized as nuisance, several longtime staples of our county's crop
portfolio (broccoli, Icafy greens, etc.) are at risk-of being restricted or pushed out. Furthermore, some

Page 76 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 156 of 348

Attachment 11

routine crop inputs like fertilizers or pesticides also can have an odor. This county has to-date differentiated crop-associated odors that may only be present during certain times of year from livestock
odors that may be present year-round. This ordinance deviates from this precedent, and unfortunately
puts a path forward for residents unhappy with crop farming odors to seek local land use restrictions on farmers. Odors are inherent in the production of most row crops to some degree or another. Clearly in the background of this hemp conversation, the County is also contending with vocal complaints about odors from cannabis operations; but, where will we draw the line for the rest of agriculture? Farm Bureau opposes banning a federally legal agricultural commodity based on odor, and we believe this ordinance takes our County down an anti-business and anti-agriculture path of overregulation. At what point will we realize the inevitable consequences of the not-in-my-backyard mentality that increasingly drives local policy decisions? We caution our County leaders to not allow current objections to hemp and cannabis odors to open the door for restricting other crops that have an odor some residents find unpleasant or a nuisance.

Issue 2: Possible Contamination of Wine Grapes
Allowing any one crop to negatively impact another crop is also problematic. Frankly, if our policy to position has to reflect a choice between protecting an existing crop benefitting : majority of our
members and welcoming a new crop, Farm Bureau will have to advocate for preserving our existing leading commodity, But longtime local farmers and residents will recall a time when wine grapes pushed out grain and hay production that was once fundamental to San Luis Obispo County agriculture. Many farmers undoubtedly faced hardship as a result of this change, but arguably wine grapes' proliferation was net positive for our local economy. If hemp lives up to the hype, do we want to close the door on an opportunity for the next generation of farmers to succeed? Judging by the success of wine grapes today, we should thank our predecessors for having an open mind and regulatory restraint by welcoming a new crop opportunity without a near-sighted determination to protect existing crops,
If cannabis or hemp does cause actual contamination of wine grapes from terpenes, this ordinance will need to be revisited after scientific evidence can guide an appropriate buffer or setback requirement. Concern about hemp and cannabis taint onto wine grapes in SLO County to date has been limited to the Edna Valley region. Hemp has been grown for the past two years immediately adjacent to wine grapes in at least two locations in SLO County (Paso Robles and in southern SLO County near Santa Maria) with no reported issues of terpene contamination. Science in the future may confirm concerns about
hemp and cannabis' negative effect on wine grapes, but no such evidence exists today. As a federally legal agricultural crop, hemp should be innocent until proven guilty.

Issue 3: Pesticide Drift Liability
To complicate the issue further, some local farmers have faced legal threats from cannabis or hemp neighbors regarding pesticide drift contamination. Some of the potential drift concern has not come from actual spray migrating to adjoining farms where cannabis or hemp is grown, but from pesticides they believe may be contained in the dust stirred up during routine field work like plowing. Other BL farmers have been unable to get aerial spraying services performed because the pesticide applicator is afraid of being sued by cannabis or hemp farmers. It is important to note, hemp does not receive the same stringent pesticide residue testing on every lot like cannabis, but pesticide residue tolerance levels for hemp are still being developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. That is, conventional farmers' pesticide drift concerns are understandably elevated for cannabis, and to a lesser but still

2

Page 77 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 157 of 348

Attachment 11

significant extent, hemp. The inability to get spraying services performed could be devastating for farmers, especially crops like avocados or grapes where the crop cannot be easily relocated.
For perspective though, the County does not attempt to shield any crops, be it conventionally or organically grown fruits or vegetables, cannabis, hemp or other crops, from pesticide drift through the Land Use Ordinance; pesticide drift cases are handled by the County Agricultural Commissioner or
directly by affected parties through litigation, We understand the frustration felt by non-hemp farmers who are being threatened with lawsuits for pesticide drift. We understand the rationale for dealing with a real and present problem today of avoiding these lawsuits by supporting a large setback requirement for hemp. But we caution those farmers and our County leaders that these setback requirements to mitigate odor and pesticide drift issues could come back later on to these same farms in the future. It is already against the law for any farmer to drift pesticides on to a neighboring farm, but low or non-
existing pesticide residue tolerance levels for cannabis or hemp has changed the discussion about how pesticides impact neighbors. If we enact restrictions to prevent cannabis or hemp growers from being contaminated by conventional agriculture's pesticide drift, surely schools, hospitals, residences and aféi about everyone else in our community will want the same pesticide drift protection. Will we now make all farmers using pesticides be two miles from : residence or school? These farmers advocating for
hemp to be regulated like cannabis or to subject hemp to large setbacks are our valued Farm Bureau members, but we caution them and our County leaders this may be "cutting off our nose to spite our
face."

Specific recommendations;
We oppose banning a federally legal agricultural crop based on odor. 2. We oppose a conditional use permit requirement for a federally legal agricultural commodity.

3. Hemp should not be regulated like cannabis. We support the ordinance's proposed standard for indoor cultivation being no detectable odor off

4. site. As minimizing off-site odors is the objective, the ordinance does not need to include specific odor control system components or equipment.

5. We believe language in Section 22.30.244 (B.)1.c of the ordinance regarding riparian and wetland setbacks should be removed. These requirements seem unnecessary. We believe the list of locations from which a setback is required may need to be broadened to include event spaces like wedding venues, in addition to protection singled out for tasting rooms.
6. We do not support the minimum site acreage requirement for indoor and outdoor hemp production. Avoiding neighbor-to-neighbor conflicts can be better achieved through some sort of buffer or setback system, For example, a farmer could locate hemp crop at the edge of a 10- acre site in close proximity to neighbors. A 10-acre minimum also discourages beginning farmers and smaller operations from growing hemp. Placing a minimum acreage requirement may be an expedient political solution to get hemp out of areas where neighbor complaints
typically come from, but disproportionally affects small and beginning growers who cannot afford larger size farms. 7. Recognizing some complaints specific to cannabis cultivation in Residential Rural areas, we support the ordinance's allowance for non-flowering hemp production in the Residential Rural land use category instead of a complete prohibition. To completely disallow hemp in Residential Rural areas would be especially problematic for our local greenhouse industry. While opinions about odors from cannabis and hemp vary, immature hemp transplants should be recognized as less odorous as they do not yet possess female flowers where odors largely originate.

3

Page 78 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 158 of 348

Attachment 11

8. We support the ordinance's allowance for temporary structures (hoop houses) to be used for hemp cultivation and for temporary drying or crop storage. 9. Our membership has diverse opinions on what an appropriate setback distance should be, ranging from hemp growers wanting no setback, to other farmers wanting a setback of several thousand feet. As has been borne out by months of stakeholder discussions through the Agricultural Liaison Advisory Board, we do not currently have sufficient science to develop setback to address all potential concerns. In the absence of this important information, the best option may be to develop a sliding scale based on hemp acreage as was recommended by ALAB. If more science becomes available in coming years regarding cannabis or hemp terpene contamination of grapes, the ordinance setback should be revised. The 300 feet setback as proposed in the ordinance is not ideal, but it is a better compromise then the 1000 feet or two-
mile setback being proposed by other stakeholders based on the limited information we have
today.

In closing, we want to thank all of our Farm Bureau members, local community groups, and the volunteer members of the Agricultural Liaison Advisory Board for providing input on this challenging issue. We also want to thank Assistant Agricultural Commissioner/Sealer Marc Lea for staffing the Hemp Subcommittee, and Planning and Building Planner Kip Morais for working expeditiously to craft an ordinance in the face of contentious debate and little agreement from stakeholders.

Sincerely,

am a resident of the Edna Valley and have lived SLO for 40 years . I have interests in vineyards and winery as well. Hemp and Cannabis are not compatible with other long term crops that have existed here in the Valley for years. Hemp and Cannabis have a horrible smell when they bloom that make many people sick. The smell of the bloom can last many days and drift for miles. I realize other crops can smell. So do dairy cows. This is different. You can have no idea what I am talking about unless you experience
yourself. The staff needs to come out to a hemp grow when it is blooming before making any proposal on how Hemp should be regulated.
The 300' setback proposed by staff is the same as no set back at all.

Dear SLO County Board of Supervisors,

I am writing to express my concern over the proposed Industrial Hemp Ordinance. As a professional
winemaker in SLO County for the past 14 years and a resident of SLO County for over 20 years, I am
wary of allowing industrial hemp cultivation in close proximity to commercial vineyard land.

It is not proven whether there is a neutral or negative impact on wine grapes from the growing and/or
processing of hemp nearby, and I feel there should be further research done prior to allowing hemp
farms in the Edna Valley wine region.

I suggest that the Edna Valley be an exclusionary area for hemp cultivation permits.

Please consider this suggestion when evaluating the hemp ordinance. Thank you for your attention to for this issue.

Respectfully,

Molly Bohlman

hemp cultivator this year. I am concerned with the offsets our property ls 400 feet wide and if we have to do a 300 foot
offset that will put us out of business so 1 really really hope you guys will consider making offsets to a existing farm 100 feet offset this would allow us to continue the farm. We had fish and game look at our lot this year and Slo County's officials were out here had no issues everything went smoothly our neighbor to the south farms squash and he has no problems at all with us farming and continuing on with our hemp business so please take into consideration the small
farmer and allow us to continue on please hundred foot 150 foot maximum for offsets thank you so much

From: Howard & Vicki Carroll
Address: 2175 Biddle Ranch Road
San Luis Obispo, CA 9401

We are writing to express our concerns on the draft "Hemp Ordinance" which is presently
being by reviewed by the Planning Department.

We live in the Edna Valley and have a wine grape vineyard surrounding our home. Our family has farmed here since 1874 and we are accustomed to agricultural operations and support
our farming community, but hemp is a nuisance and impacts both our home and health. We live over 3,000 feet up wind from the nearest planting and during the early morning time when hemp is flowering our home is filled with "skunk" smell and causes allergy conditions that require antihistamine too correct. The proposed ordinance suggests establishing 300 foot setback - this is totally inadequate! The impacts in residential neighborhoods and locations where people gather, depending on wind and distance from hemp must be
intolerable.

The minimum parcel size of 10 acres will only create more conflicts in residential areas. This crop belongs on large rural lands where it will not impact their neighbors.

In addition, the terpenes which the hemp plant produces has an unknown impact, at this
time, on the wine grapes that we have been cultivating for 29 years. If we determine a negative impact caused by the terpenes from the hemp crop, it will impact our ability to sell
wine grapes.

We have sent emails and called, but there does not appear to be way to protect our home. The only way is to create strong ordinance with significant set backs from residential, commercial and other operations. The present draft ordinance is inadequate!
Thank you for your consideration.

Kip Morais , Brian Pedrotti and all Planning Commissioners,

I have reviewed the Draft Industrial Hemp Ordinance and I am writing to let you
know how inadequate this report is. It was written by the County Staff, and does
not at all reflect the views of the Ag Liaison Advisory Board, nor the Committee
formed by the ALAB Board, which was formed to make suggested
recommendations to the SLO County Board of Supervisors on this new crop.

I am a native of SLO County and I own and operate a Farm Management
Company. I employ over 50 full time employees, and up to 100 seasonal workers
to operate over 1700 acres of various permanent crops in the Edna Valley and
SLO County.

In June of 2019, The Board of Supervisors asked the ALAB board to make
recommendations to the Board of Supervisors so that all sides Existing
Agriculture, Residents, existing businesses, the Public, and new Hemp Growers)
would be satisfied with the BOS decisions and rules that would be voted upon at
the upcoming meeting in the spring of 2020.

The Draft Ordinance suggests a 300' setback for Hemp Growers. This 300'
number is totally inadequate, and is not at all what the ALAB board suggested.
Staff used this number because this is the Marijuana crop setback. My workers,
as well as myself, have experienced the skunky odors that are very prevalent in
the early morning air from the flowering Hemp crop. Most of the complaints that
we hear from our workers are within 1 mile of the Hemp fields in the Edna
Valley. However we have experienced allergic reactions up to 2 miles away from
the Hemp fields. With this experience, I know that the staff recommended
is setback of 300' is going to create many problems with residents, tasting rooms, event centers, schools, churches, existing Ag crops, and with our tourism
industry. These allergic reactions are a real health hazard, and need to be studied to
before any Hemp is allowed to grow.

ATTENTION: This email originated from outside the County's network. Use caution when opening attachments or

SLO County Board of Supervisors and Planners:

I am writing to oppose the County of San Luis Obispo Hemp Ordinance as drafted. My
husband, Stephen Ross Dooley and I, and many others have invested our lives in the wine
industry of the Edna Valley AVA and surrounding area. We have vineyard of our own in the Edna Valley AVA, and also buy grapes from other vineyards in the area on which we have
based our winery, Stephen Ross. We celebrated our 25th vintage this year.

Our is concern is that decades-long investment in the $100 million range in the wine industry, farming, production and tourism sectors, will undeniably be undermined and greatly devalued if hemp is permitted within the AVA or in close proximity to wine grape vineyards. Terpene drift is proven. Smoke taint is proven. Malodorous conditions are proven. (Reference attached letter from UC Davis Enology and Viticulture professor Oberholster.) Why would you undermine your own county by permitting conditions that will wreak havoc on the existing farming, production and tourism that supports the local economy?

Neither the setbacks nor the site specification in the Hemp ordinance are based on science,
or any specific conditions within our valley. They seem to mimic the cannabis ordinance, but
cannabis relies on the discretionary permit process as a check and balance. Thi s is not the
case in the proposed Hemp ordinance. This makes zero sense.
Please. Protect your ag community, your local wine economy, and your constituents. Prohibit hemp farming in the Edna Valley.

Mr. Moras and Mr. Pedrotti:

In the near future, you will be asking the Planning Commission to amend it's ordinances as they pertain to the growing of hemp in San Luis Obispo County. I have issues with what has been presented, primarily with what has happened recently and how your proposed ordinance changes would address and resolve the issues.
We are residents of the County for 38 years. For the past 20 years we have owned a parcel on the southern border of the Edna Valley next to the Cold Canyon Landfill, and lived on it for 15 years as residents.
After being out of the area for a few weeks this last September, we returned the first of October. On October 2nd, my wife smelled hemp/cannabis odors for about 1 hour that were coming from the primary grower in the middle of the Edna Valley. We are 5,800 feet from the
hemp/cannabis grow site and 6,300 feet from the hemp growing site. For purposes of this
letter, I will use the 5,800 foot distance as the distance to the odor site. I sent a complaint to
the County, the Board of Supervisors, the individual Board members, the APCD, the AG Commissioner's office, and the Planning Department.
The only response was from the APCD, who said that since the CA Department of Food and Agriculture has identified cannabis (which includes hemp) as an agricultural product, that have no jurisdiction as agricultural crops are specifically exempted from APCD regulation dealing with nuisance odors.

There was no response from the AG Commissioner's office.
On October 4th, I smelled the hemp/cannabis again, this time for an extended period of about 4 hours. It was smelled by four other people. It was at a higher elevation than the first complaint. I did not report it, because the first nuisance complaint was pending for a County response. That response was never received.
I cite this experience, because it should cause the staff and the decision makers to pause and ask the question, "How does the proposed ordinance address this type of complaint? Would it have been dealt with and resolved?"
Contrary to the comment by one Board member questioning the possibility that these odors could travel over a mile, the odors did travel over mile. In the case of the first complaint, 5,800 feet. This was at the floor of the Valley, which is about 40 feet above the elevation of the hemp grow site. For the second complaint, it was smelled at an elevation of 420', of 120' above the elevation of the grow sites.

I am writing regarding the draft Industrial Hemp Ordinance. My wife, father and I live at 6525
Mira Cielo in Edna Valley and have been unwilling participants in ongoing experiment on the effects of cannibis and industrial hemp in the area. We had no previous exposure to hemp
prior to cultivation approximately 2500 feet up the East Corral de Piedra Creek.

I have allergies which have drastically reduced my sense of smell but my wife, like our neighbors, reports the smell makes spending time outside very unpleasant. My 93 year old father, like me, suffers from allergies. At his age, side effects make allergy medications inadvisable. I fly as a commercial pilot and subject to FAA restrictions. FAA regulations make the more effective antihistamines unusable without a period of 2.5 to 5 days after the last
dose. There have been periods when I would be unable to fly due to the allergic reactions or
barred from flying due to having to take proscribed antihistamines. I consulted with my
allergist about adding hemp to the antigen shots I take and was told that due to Federal research restrictions there was no test available for hemp allergy and therefore no antigen
available. My father's and my increased allergic reactions correlated with my wife's reports of
hemp odor.

You don't explain your methodology for determining setbacks which could prevent movement
of hemp pollen and odor. The Association of Official Seed Certifying Agencies recommends up
to three miles to avoid hemp cross pollenation. We notice the effects of hemp in the air at our house when the air becomes still beginning in the evening, and continuing until the wind
begins in the morning. The still air allows the pollen/terpenes to concentrate in the air. As the
air cools after sunset it descends, further concentrating the pollen and odorific terpenes. The
cooler, denser air then flows down slope. In our case it follows the same path as water down the East Corral de Piedra Creek. A 300 foot setback is a nice, definable number, but has no to relationship to the movement of pollen and terpenes and their effects on residents.
The draft ordinance obviously takes hemp odor seriously since it requires that odor not escape from an indoor grow. How is the odor from an outdoor grow any less of an issue?
The draft ordinance is clearly inadequate. The Air Force taught me to never complain about a problem without proposing a solution. Proper prediction of the flow of air containing pollen
and terpenes requires expensive and time consuming measurement and modeling. It appears
the only reliable way to ensure the effects of hemp cultivation do not make existing residences subject to the problems we now face. If that is not cost effective for growers, the three mile

I have reviewed the proposed ordinance and find it woefully inadequate. I live
close to a burgeoning hemp/cannabis project and raise wine grapes. While there
are many inadequacies ,I will keep it short.
As I understand it ,a residence located in an Ag zone will have no setbacks. This constitutes a travesty for a variety of reasons:1) Noise- hemp seems to require
containers with dehumidifiers(or a cooler installed inside containers). These facilities run 24/7 and are especially disconcerting during night hours, interrupting sleep.
2) Odors- several crops per year result in an almost non-stop and unpleasant environment.

As a result of both legislation and voter actions hemp/cannabis operations are new operations and should carry the burden of proof to qualify for legal
operation vs. requiring an established residence school or health care facility to
complain about odors,noise, and other inconveniences caused by a proposed ordinance ,that is without much in the way of guiding principals.
Please go back to the drawing board. Thank you for your efforts.

TO: Jay Brown, Don Campbell, Jim Harrison, Dawn Ortiz-Legg and Michael Multari, commissioners.

Dear Commissioners.

I am writing to you to cite our experiences with an issue which I understand is under your consideration.
The issue is the growing of "Industria) Hemp." I do not have any knowledge of the actual value of that crop, nor its relationship to marljuana, and do not comment on those things here.
However, 1 do live in the Los Osos area and I and my wife and friends regularly bicycle and otherwlse
travel through our county for both business and recreation. We have watched with curiosity the
industrial hemp operations along Los Osos Valley Road, from its initial planting until its harvest.
It is difficult to fault an agricultural crop. They are usually benign, somewhat scenic, and offer evidence
of human productlvity; all good things.
However, for some reason, industrial hemp production carries with it one very objectionable
characteristic. It smells terrible. We, and our neighbors who have discussed the issue with us, agree
that the raising of industrial hemp severely interferes with our enjoyment of our environment. Visitors
have commented that they strongly dislike the smell of these operations.
In most broadly populated rural areas, cattle feeding and swine production are prohibited; not because
of an effort to stop human productivity, but because the resulting smells are Inconsistent with livable
neighborhoods. There are, of course, hundreds of industrial activities which are similarly restricted by
towns because they make neighborhoods unlivable.
I am uncomfortable with excessive regulations, but this particular agricultural production is so offensive
to the surrounding community that it seems we should restrict its operation to those areas far from
residential environments.

Thank you for considering our concerns.
I would be happy to appear in the event of a public discussion of this issue.

Sincerely,

John B. Goodrich and Janice Odell

RE: Concerns on Hemp and Cannabis Cultivation in in Edna Valley
As a resident and wine industry business owner, I am very concerned over the current draft
recommendatlons being submitted to the Board. This is a very controversial and far reaching Issue on the effects of hemp and cannabis growing for our wine grape growing, winemaking, and tourist
destination community and residents.
As this product has been ilegal for so long, there is no research, no funding, and no published papers for laws and regulations to be based on. The language of this ordinance should in my mind be restrictive in
light of the lack of knowledge and in light of the many concerns brought before the Board of
Supervisors. As more knowledge, facts, and effects are known, make changes accordingly based on the
experience of our county and others.
The 300' setback is inadequate and has no basis for being determined as an appropriate distance.
Our tasting room on Biddle Ranch Road is 3000' from the grow site near Price Canyon and
Highway 227. On many occasions this year, we have had complaints from customers who find the odor
objectionable and from employees who are sickened by the odor during the course of the business days.
The odor is a very real, obJectlonable disturbance to people's dally lives for multiple days and months
of the year.

We have lived in Edna Valley for 34 years and have experienced harvest seasons for many types
of agricultural products. None, not Brussel sprouts, not broccoll, not peppers, could ever impact our
sensory preceptors as hemp does. A field of turned over vegetables mentioned above during the fall
may be unpleasant for a few days a year and Is quite localized, typically when you drive by, Hemp odors
on the other hand can be throughout the year and travel thousands of feet and have real adverse
effects on people. We do not know the health risks associated with these odors as well.
The long term, permanent effects of this ordinance have the strong possibility to change our
valley, business and all of SLO County resident's quality of life for decades to come. This ordinance
should be very tight until more is known about its effect on nearby children, adults, and seniors and on
our local wine industry. The Board must have funding, measurable specifications, and staff in place to
monitor grows before the moratorium is lifted. It should not be the other way around. If the county
does not have the funds to properly monitor, test, and enforce the ordinance, then we cannot proceed
expanding and loosening regulations and permits. Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Respectfully,

ATTENTION: This email originated from outside the County's network. Use caution when opening attachments or

Dear Kip and Brian,

Thanks for your good work on the proposed SLO County hemp ordinance. Below find my comments.

-the 300' setbacks proposed are good balance between the needs of hemp industry stakeholders and
concerned neighbors. As you know, existing CA county ordinances in Merced, Sonoma and San Joaquin propose 100'/200' setbacks . Moreover, there are 18 CA counties - including the state's largest hemp
producers - that have no setback or land use restrictions on hemp cultivation. The establishment of
onerous setbacks in SLO county would have the ultimate impact of preventing development of the
hemp industry, thereby eliminating a lucrative source of employment and taxes.
I recommend that there be the possibility of waiving the required minimum setback between neighbors if this is done with written consent. This is allowed both in Sonoma and Monterey county
ordinances.
- there is no CA county ordinance that requires the use of odor control equipment for hemp greenhouse
operations. I would recommend that this requirement be removed from the SLO county ordinance.
- Also, the requirement of a 5-acre minimum site for indoor operations is an onerous requirement for a
local grower in region with high land costs. There is also no such requirement found anywhere else in
the state.
- I recommend that in-field sales of industrial hemp be allowed. U-pick sales of hemp have been an
effective distribution mechanism for farmers in other states. This will be particularly important as hemp cbd profit margins continue to drop.

Thank you for your work on this.

[EXT]Outdoor Industrial Hemp Draft Ordinance

Board of Supervisors; PL_LongRangeShared &

ATTENTION: This email originated from outside the County's network. Use caution when opening attachments or
links.
Dear Board of Supervisors, Kip Morais and Brian Pedrotti,
I am writing you today with regard to the San Luis Obispo County's proposed Industrial Hemp Ordinance drafted by county staff members for your consideration. I would like to specifically address my concerns as a business professional running a business in Edna Valley and the
negative impacts we've experience from a hemp growing operation that exists less than a
mile down the road from our usiness, located at 300 Green Gate Road in San Luis Obispo.
have been directly involved with the restoration and development of Greengate Ranch & Vineyard, located in Edna Valley from when it was first acquired by it's new ownership in 2012. Since that time, we worked tirelessly to restore the property and we are now running a very successful Events & Wedding Venue, home rental business and we farm a 90+ acre vineyard. Currently, we host 20- 25 weddings a year with an average guest list of approximately 200 ppl in attendance and during our off season, we have 4 rental homes all of which have few vacancies. Our business operations bring approximately 4-5,000 travelers a year from all over the country and Edna Valley is now nationally recognized as a top location for destination weddings We currently employ 6 full-time employees and by many standards are considered a small employer to our county's workforce. That said, each year we refer business to over a 50+ various local vendors from the events and wedding industry. These vendors include: Event planners, photographers, caterers, beverage service providers, wineries, florists, lighting/draperies installers, furnishings, linens & service wear rental companies, musicians and DJs. In addition to our vendor referrals, those attending guests also require accommodations, dining experiences and enjoy the very best of SLO County's wine country. I share these business statistics not to boast of our successes, but rather to impress on you how impactful our business is not only to our local business community, but also in boosting tourism and creating lasting impressions with thousands of people every
year.

For those reasons, I urge you once again to consider our concerns with the Industrial Hemp Ordinance as drafted and specifically with regard to the cultivation set-backs. The proposed draft does not recognize or sufficiently address potential health concerns and/or safety of any resident, proximity to schools, impacts on businesses, their employees or the air quality due to cultivation and harvesting of Hemp. Our business co-exists on a shared road with neighboring hemp grower and the simple facts prove a 300 ft set-back does not provide adequate distance to diffuse the smell as we are less than a mile distance away. On several occasions the odor has been so strong it permeates throughout our property & into the homes and our guests have left with a negative experience. This coupled with the potential of multiple grow cycles to push yields, gives us little reprieve from the odors that linger far beyond the initial harvest. Therefore, it is our conclusion that running a business within close proximity to hemp production is harmful to our business, our benefactors, i.e., the vendors we work with as well as the local businesses outside our referral group.
In closing, given the on-going revisions occurring at the State and Federal level, it may prove wise to observe the progression as the regulations evolve and allow time for further research
on all the impacts of the Industrial Hemp production. In the meantime, should you move forward with some version of the ordinance, we respectfully ask that you reconsider the proposed set-backs requirements and increase distance far beyond a mere 300 ft. from any

I have lived in Edna Valley since 1989. Although this area is zoned for agriculture, my property is part of a cluster of about 30 homes that were approved by the County for residential development some 30 years ago. Our home is located about 1000 feet from a nearby commercial hemp and cannabis growing operation, and
we've experienced a number of undesirable affects from this operation that we
don't experience from the numerous other agricultural crops grown in the area.
One significant issue is the offensive odors which can be overpowering, depending on the direction of the wind. We have one family member, and a few guests,
whose respiratory allergies force them to remain inside the house during these
conditions.

feel strongly that the County should limit hemp and cannabis growing operations to agricultural areas that are not populated with so much County-approved
residential development as is the case here in Edna Valley.

Dear Mr. Morales and Mr. Pedrotti,

The following are comments on the Draft Hemp Ordinance:

1. The ordinance should include ALL THE AGRICULTURAL CROPS IN THE LAND USES
CATEGORIES FOR THE COASTAL AND INLAND (not just Hemp) since there are NUISANCE
ODORS associated with farming practices in ALL crop production.

2. The Setbacks from RSF, RMF, RS,URL, schools (and add Hospitals/Medical facilities),
wetlands, riparian vegetation, (and add Watercourses), should be increased to 1000'.

3. Adding all agriculture crops to this ordinance because of NUISANCE ODORS would provide adjacent residential, schools, and medical uses the healthy quiet enjoyment of living that they are entitled to. Also, it would help to maintain and restore our waterways, wetlands, riparian areas to a healthier idition.

Thank you for your attention to this important matter for the County of San Luis Obispo
residents.

Sincerely,
Marsha Lee

RE: Proposed Hemp Ordinance
Typically, you will not find me opposing county projects/business opportunities,
as I'm usually the recipient of opposition regarding my project proposals. In this
instance however I need to register my opposition to the county proposed hemp
ordinance. We oppose for several reasons: One is a concern of compatibility with
existing crops, inadequate setbacks, potential spray drift liability issues for
existing crops, etc. The existing crop rotation along with permanent vineyards
provide a homogeneous atmosphere for the residents in Edna Valley. Second the
odor emitting from the hemp is very noticeable and pungent which will have a
negative effect on residents and wine tasting venues. While there are numerous
other issues with the hemp ordinance, our opposition deserves your support.
There are many other areas within the county that could support hemp
cultivation, Edna Valley is not one of them. We are requesting your support to
prohibit the cultivation of hemp in the Edna Valley.

Dear Board of Supervisors and Planning Department:

I am writing to express my concern about the proposed hemp ordinance. The wine industry is a critical
economic driver in our county, and it is incredible to me that the County is willing to take actions to
jeopardize it. Hemp grows present real and significant threats to both vineyards and tasting rooms
through the potential taint to grapes from hemp terpenes and noxious odors and health concerns to
workers and visitors. The ordinance in its current form does not do enough to address these issues. would urge you to take much more time to study these important issues and craft an ordinance that protects both the wine we sell throughout the state, country, and globe and the experience that wine
tourists to our county currently enjoy.

Dear SLO County Board of Supervisors,

I'm writing in regard to the proposed Industrial Hemp Ordinance as Niner Wine Estates owns 110 acres off Buckley Road in the Edna Valley AVA, of which 77 acres are planted with wine grapes.

We are in support of establishing an exclusionary area in the new ordinance for the Edna Valley AVA. In short, some of the climactic conditions that result in the area being a wonderful place to grow grapes
also contribute to us having a greater concern on the exact set-back distance that would allow both hemp and wine grapes to be farmed without harming each other. We feel there is more research that
should be done before a proper set-back distance can be identified and that it is prudent to do so in
order to avoid damage to businesses and the costly litigation that has plagued other areas of California.

Thank you for considering our point of view as you develop the ordinance.

RE: Draft Hemp Ordinance

I am writing to express my concerns with the draft Hemp Ordinance. I live in the Edna Valley and have experienced the first hemp grow by Darren Shetler in the Valley this past summer and fall. It was and continues to be a bad experience. The worst is the ongoing smell of the crop. It has lasted longer thau 2 months and still smells. Another part of the Shetler grow is the fact that he is not a kind farmer. I have firsthand knowledge of him threatening neighbor farmers with lawsuits for potential drift issues. This would cause great harm to their livelihood.
The Ordinance is quite weak in being able to address many issucs. The setbacks, being one of them, are not enough to keep the smell away from the many residences, public wine tasting venues, schools and event centers. The schools are almost always the first consideration for long distance setbacks. The Valley has become economically viable with beautiful properties thal pay significant property taxes, wineries that attract thousands of visitors, and event centers that allow many great memories of weddings and parties. All of these are healthy revenue generators for the county. The presence of hemp near these properties greatly teduces their values and contributions to the county.
The hemp crop does not fit the agricultural landscape of Edna Valley. The crop comes with so many unknowns and should not be allowed to be grown in Edna Valley. urge you and the rest of the siaff to provide a "carve out" of Edna Valley for hemp grows in the ordinauce. Thank you for your attention to this most serious matter.

Dear Director Trevor Keith,

I am writing to you to strongly request that you permanently ban Marijuana and Hemp growing from the productive, yet fragile Edna Valley.
I understand why some economic pressure may be against this.
However, I strongly believe any significant risk to our valley for Grape Production, for
delightful venues and for property values must be avoided.

I am hoping you will do the right thing.

Specifically:

1. Planting of Hemp and Marijuana in the fragile and unique Edna Valley should be permanently banned
2. A 400-foot setback is clearly inadequate based on Oregon experience at 1600 feet, it should be at least 1 mile. The foggy, calm evenings in the EV, during growing season, will accumulate and magnify deleterious effects.
3. All planting of Hemp in the County should be banned until impacts have been studied and understood; leading to county Ordnances regulating such plantings
4. This will require at least 6 months of studies and assessments
of the experiences and techniques in other states and quantifying economic risk to SLO county
5. Failure to completely understand this situation will place substantial economic risk on wine, wine-tasting, event hosting and

Reference: Proposed Industrial Hemp Ordinance for SLO County

We are writing to voice our opposition to the proposed countywide industrial hemp ordinance.
As SLO natives, we care deeply about the quality of life and economic viability of the community. For the record, we to are not opposed to appropriate farming and sales of Hemp and CBD oil. In fact, we
are both users of CBD oil.

Our concern lies with the seemingly lower standards allowed in the proposed hemp ordinance vs.
those required by the current marijuana ordinance, thereby providing a lower level of protection for residential and business neighbors. We further feel that hemp grows should be located in areas that are not heavily populated or contain significant vulnerable crops such as wine grapes.
The marijuana ordinance affords some protection for the general public by requiring a minimum 300- foot setback for both indoor and outdoor grows. We believe this seemingly arbitrary distance is inadequate in populated areas. However, the ordinance requires a discretionary permit subject to a

Attachment 11

hearing where impacted residents and businesses can at least voice their concerns with the aim of
increasing the set back and limiting the potential off-site odors.

The proposed hemp ordinance lacks these protections as it only requires a maximum 300-foot
setback for indoor grows located outside of Ag Zones. No setback is required for grows within Ag
Zones. Furthermore, the proposed hemp ordinance seems to only require a ministerial permit which
does not provide for a public hearing in which impacted residents and businesses can present their
issues and concern's.

Highly populated areas such as Edna Valley are not appropriate for cultivation of hemp which may
adversely affect the community by the release of terpenes and oders associated with hemp
grows. There is an abundance of lightly populated locations in the county where hemp can be grown
without impacting nearby residents or existing businesses.
The current proposal contains too many flaws and deficiencies. We urge you to further evaluate the matter, with due consideration to existing residential and crop lands (especially grapes which seem to
be vulnerable the terpenes from hemp) and, at the very least, provide for the same levels of
protection of residential and commercial neighbors as those afforded in the in marijuana ordinance.
We respectively request your consideration to rewrite the proposed ordinance to afford reasonable
protections for existing residential and commercial interests.

Dear Board of Supervisors, Kip Morais and Brian Pedrotti,

I'm writing to express my concerns with the proposed Industrial Hemp Ordinance draft. After directly experiencing the
negative effects of the nearby hemp production over the last 16 months, the proposed draft does not adequately address nuisance odors, health concerns and or enforcement. As drafted, the ordinance will significantly impact the quality of living, the tourism and events industry, wine industry and property values within Edna Valley.

In particular, the proposed ordinance needs significantly greater set-backs from residences (including those zoned rural residential), schools and parks, adjacent crops, tasting rooms and event centers, businesses with onsite customers, and to protect those with sensitive receptors, health issues and allergies. I live approximately 2000 feet away from the field where hemp is grown, and the odor is very strong and requires us to close windows and stay indoors when present. By the way, the belief that the odor is only around a few weeks during harvest is a farce. The odor is prevalent weeks before harvest, and weeks after harvest as the harvest dries and plant remnants remain onsite. Furthermore, as growers will naturally push to harvest multiple crops per year, the amount of time the odors will be a nuisance will dramatically
increase in the future.

Additionally, the proposed draft does not address any enforcement of hemp regulations nor complaint resolution. There needs to be clear effective enforcement and complaint resolution processes by the appropriately authorized, and fully funded, local agency. As we've experienced already here in Edna Valley, the lack of enforcement will promote
unscrupulous growers to ignore regulations and avoid rectifying complaints leading to further discontent between growers and the community.

Lastly, with the State of California and Federal government currently updating their Industrial Hemp regulations, it
seems prudent to wait until the revised regulations are published before approving local ordinance. This would allow for
proper consideration of any relevant new regs, and better alignment with the State and Fed regs.

Respectfully

Robert Reid

[EXT]Edna Valley marijuana and hemp crops

Dear Director Trevor Keith,

> It has been brought to our attention that there is a possibility that marijuana and hemp will
be allowed as crops in the Edna Valley, where we live. We feel strongly that these crops should
be banned here. Although possibly profitable as crops, we believe the detriment to this beautiful area would be great. In addition, the already thriving grape production, event venues,
real estate market, tourist destinations, and pleasant living environment would most certainly be adversely impacted. These local effects would carry over to the entire county. Any positives
of these crops are outweighed by the negatives.

Please realize this beautiful valley we call home is a precious and fragile area and that if
marijuana and hemp are allowed to be grown here the entire area will be changed for the worse, as has been seen in other areas.

Please do what you can to prevent marijuana and hemp from coming in to the Edna Valley and surrounding area. The supposed economical gains do not balance the tremendous loss to
environment, current businesses, and lifestyle.

These comments are further to my comments to the BOS on June 17, 2019 (3:40 pm). As1 indicated therein, I have lived at 6235 Orcutt Rd (corner of Biddle and Orcutt) for over 34 years. I co-founded Tolosa Winery (35 full time employees and up to 85 during harvest) and planted and own with the Baggetts over 700 acres of grapes here in the Edna Valley (providing full time employment to 20 workers and up to 100 during harvest). In my June letter, I expressed certain concerns, principally the noxious odors emitted from hemp, the migration of hemp terpenes onto my grapes, causing "skunk" taint on the grapes, and the decrease in value of my property, What I did not anticipate were the adverse health effects I experienced in the fall when a hemp grow was flowering. This grow--2,000 fect away--caused severe watering of my eyes and uncontrollable sneezing when the wind was blowing my way. My neighbors had similarly complained and frankly, was skeptical. No longer. This problem will be exacerbated when hemp operations reach full scale with 3-4 months with each grow. harvests per year- and a flowering season of 1-2

I see real inconsistencies in policies between the Cannabis Ordinance (marijuana) and the draft Hcmp Ordinance, probably attributable to the staff having to move way too fast, in the in face of so many unknowns. For example:
in the Cannabis Ordinance, the County recognized the deleterious effects of offsite odors for both indoor and outdoor grows. Accordingly, it prohibited ANY offsite odors and required all applicants to submit an odor management plan to show how the operation would prevent offsite odors. While the draft Hemp Ordinance prohibits offsite odors from indoor hemp grows, it does not do so for outdoor grows. This makes no sense because marijuana grows are limited to 3 acres, while hemp grows are unlimited in size. The larger the grow, the more intense the odor problem. For consistency, the hemp ordinance should also prohibit offsite odors. The draft hemp ordinance also fails to require a "statement of neighborhood compatibility" together with a plan to address potential compatibility issues. There are 3 verifiable concerns from hemp terpenes:
1. noxious odors: 2. adverse health effects; 3. the real threat of "skunk" taint> (See my letter of behalf of the Edna Valley Growers MWC dated December 19, 2019, enclosing Prof Oberholster's opinion concerning the risks of terpene drift onto grapes).
In contrast, the draft Hemp Ordinance places no burden on the hemp grower to demonstrate a plan to address the incompatibilities of bringing in a new crop to the Edna Valley. Instead, it assumes the burden should be on existing vineyard owners, tasting room owners and event center owners to provide scientific evidence to support their concerns. Who should have the burden of proof here? After the vineyard industry (and related event centers) has invested well over $100M, should not the hemp growers have the burden to prove hemp will not harm the existing ag owners? We know that even the perception of "skunk" taint has resulted in vineyard owners losing sales contracts. Moreover, the Cannabis Ordinance squarely places the burden on the cannabis grower-so should the Hemp Ordinance.

Page 116 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 196 of 348

Attachment 11

The Cannabis industry has been banned for 7 decades. Hemp growing just in the last few years became legal as a federal matter; and several states have legalized marijuana. So, there is a real scarcity of studies dealing with the compatibility of cannabis on existing crops, businesses and residences, as well as health effects on cannabis workers in the field and ag field workers nearby.
Neither the setbacks specified in the Hemp Ordinance-300 feet or some other number - nor the specification of site size is based on science or experience. 10 acres seems to be just an arbitrary number and could just as well be 100. Additionally, the 300 foot setback for the Hemp Ordinance was simply adopted from the Cannabis ordinance. But the 300 feet in the Cannabis ordinance is the minimum setback because the process involves a discretionary permit-so the neighbors can argue for a greater setback, whereas the 300 foot setback in the Hemp Ordinance is the maximum -the process is a ministerial over the counter exercise No discretion to lengthen the setback. This is another discrepancy between the two ordinances.
Also, the Cannabis Ordinance measures the setback from the grower's property line. The Hemp draft measures from the edge of the grow to the edge of the residence. Another discrepancy,
Another shortcoming of the Hemp Ordinance: lack of meaningful enforcement. The elephant in the room is the lack of resources to enforce. Violators to date have been running circles around county enforcement efforts and will continue to do so. Lip service to enforcement is not sufficient, Much larger staff and resources for testing equipment are required for an honest commitment to enforcement. Enforcement will in any event be difficult. For example, the Hemp draft provides that outdoor cultivation "will be limited to non-flowering transplants only", Try and enforce that one

Bottom line: No other crop grown in the Edna Valley can be grown into an illegal product except hemp. Given all of the above, I respectfully urge that hemp should be prohibited from the Edna Valley.

Facts re: the Edna Valley Appellation and Hemp
1. There are 3 federally approved appellations in the County: Paso Robles (660,000 acres); Arroyo Grande (39,646 acres) and Edna Valley (18,970 acres excluding the City of SLO) 2. The County land mass is 2,111,360 acres, The Edna Valley is a small valley--it represents just 0.008 of the total acreage in the County. It has a high concentration of vineyards, wineries, tasting rooms, and event centers. Also, Los Ranchos School and several dense neighborhoods and ranchettes throughout the Valley.
3. The Edna Valley is unique in California: (a) it is the coldest appellation in California; (b) it is the only appellation with 2 transverse valleys open to the ocean (Morro Bay-Los Osos
and Pismo Beach) and (c) it has the longest grape growing season in California with bud break in Feb and harvest to Nov.
4. Because the Edna Valley is truly a valley, generally surrounded by hills, its climatic
characteristics are uniform throughout the Valley. This differs from the "open" Paso
Robles and Arroyo Grande appellations where the western and eastern portions have dramatically different temperatures, fog and wind. For example, Growing Degree Days ("GDD") for Paso Robles west and east range from 3117 to 3342 (F). For Edna Valley, the GDD is relatively constant 2371 (F). (Note: The GDD numbers were provided by UC Ag Extension, based on 24-hour monitoring. With only one monitoring station in the Arroyo Grande appellation, no GDD range could be provided). 5. With marine air from sources, the Edna Valley experiences relatively high amounts of fog and wind from March to November, as compared to the Paso Robles and Arroyo Grande appellations. Wind records show windy conditions 2/3's of the time-average 7-8 MPH-and 20-30 MPH peak all year. Also, the winds predominately come from 2 directions, thereby creating a mix of wind influence, which is a recipe for broad distribution of hemp terpenes over large distances. Recent flowering from a hemp grow in the Valley was detected over 1 mile in several directions from in the grow. The foggy conditions in the Edna Valley---near stagnant air mass-- also promote migration of hemp terpenes once the winds kick in later in the day.
6. Health effects: this flowering from a hemp grow this fall in the Edna Valley caused respiratory problems and insomnia for many residents up to 1 mile from the grow. Many complaints were lodged with the County. Odors from cauliflower and broccoli don't have these adverse effects on neighbors. 7. "Smoke" taint from wildfires unfortunately is a reality. The 'smoke" taint from wildfires in No Calif has caused immense monetary losses to the wine industry, due to cancellation of contracts and rejection of grape after the wildfires. 8. The predominant terpene in Cannabis (whether marijuana or hemp) is myrcene which emits the strongly noxious "skunk" taint. At the July hearing on the hemp moratorlum, we expressed serious concern over the threat of terpene drift on to vineyards resulting in unmerchantable grapes. We were told by the industry they we were engaging in "fear mongering". But it turns out the fear of "skunk" taint is well founded. Please see the
attached Oct 28, 2019 opinion letter from Prof. Oberholtser, U.C.Davis, in which she describes that the deleterious effect of smoke volatiles and eucalyptus terpenes have had on grapes and the resulting end product--wine. She strongly suggests the cannabis

Page 118 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 198 of 348

Attachment 11

terpenes may have the same adverse effect on grapes, and wine. With the foggy conditions and near continual winds in our "true" valley, the risk of terpene drift is higher than any other location in this County,
9. Prof. Oberholseter stresses the need for research before risking the viability of the
vineyard industry. But even without definitive research, the fear of "skunk" taint is
taking its toll. In Oregon, grape contracts have been cancelled for fear of "skunk" taint from a marijuana grow on adjacent property. Why would a grape buyer risk "skunk" taint, especially when the defect in the wine may appear much later? Oregon legalized before Calif and forecasts the future for us.
10. Cannabis growers in Santa Barbara County have threatened and sued over spray drift- cannabis is very sensitive to pesticides, insecticides and fungicides. In fact, this issue of spray drift is even greater in the Edna Valley due to its foggy and windy conditions. The best conditions for spraying are in the morning before the wind picks up. But on foggy mornings the sprays can be suspended in the fog and then distributed when the wind
picks up. We can learn from the experience in Santa Barbara. There avocado and citrus growers have been forced to curtail or reduce spraying due to claims/threats from the cannabis growers. These threats have already stopped companies from aerial spraying. And growers have now eliminated spraying near any cannabis grow, just letting some of their crops fail for fear of a lawsuit. In one case, a vineyard owner in Santa Barbara was sued for fungicide drift-she then went organic and lost her crop to mildew.
11. Vineyards and orchards face existential threats from insects such as the Asian citrus psyllid, the glassy winged sharpshooter etc. To save these permanent crops, we need to use insecticides, and in the case of citrus, need to use "air blasters" to cover the
trees. Introducing hemp into the Edna Valley would obviously inhibit these "lifesaving"
measures.
12. The Edna Valley is extremely susceptible to Powdery Mildew. Combined with a very
long growing season, the amount of spraying to prevent Powdery Mildew is more than triple the number of sprays a vineyard in the North County receives. This means the Edna Valley grape growers will face far greater risk of spray drift than other growers in the County.
13, In the Edna Valley, approximately $140,000,000 has been invested in wine grapes -a permanent crop--together with associated wineries, tasting rooms and event center--- supporting a large ag tourism industry. Why risk this long-term investment for seãsonal crop, before definitive research is completed? 14. 25 counties prohibit hemp. Napa is banning both hemp and marijuana. Monterey severely restricts hemp in a pilot program. Some counties and states severely restrict hemp due to concerns of cross-pollination-cannot be grown within 5 miles of marijuana (Washington state) and 4 miles in Yolo County.

Introduction

1 am a faculty member in the Department of Viticulture and Enology at University of California, Davis California. My Department is ranked number one in the world and combines the sciences of viticulture and enology in a single research and teaching unit that encompasses all of the scientific disciplines that impact grape growing and winemaking. The faculty roster includes scientists fiom the fields of chemistry, genetics, microbiology, chemical engineering, horticulture, biochemistry, plant physiology, and sensory science. Multidisciplinary and strategic research and teaching programs cover all major aspects of viticulture and cnology. The Department's research is aimed at expanding knowledge of the factors that impact grape and wine characters so that the wincmaking processes could be tailored by individual winemakers to achieve the desired flavor and aroma profiles in the finished wine. This allowed the industry to move beyond mere commercial acceptability to the production of intricately crafted fine wines. Objective methods of sensory evaluation of wines were developed in the Department that is now widely used throughout the food and beverage industries. Descriptive analysis of wines has now become a standard procedure for wine evaluation and has had the added benefit of making wines less intimidating for the consummer. Marketplace interest in wine has further increased due to recent Department research that point to various components in wine that may have beneficial human health effects.

Today, there are considerable concerns regarding the adverse effect that high concentrations of certain terpenes can have wine flavor, including terpenes commonly emitted from cannabis plants. Some common cannabis terpenes are associated with other plants and have been demonstrated to adversely affect wine quality.
The California grape and wine industry is a $31.9 billion dollar industry, with 637,000 acres of winegrapes planted. Based on a Stonebridge Rescarch report published in December 2015, the Santa Barbara County wine industry has a $1.7 billion dollar economic impact on the region. Recent legislation adopted by the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors established regulations for the cultivation of recreational cannabis within the unincorporated regions of the Santa Barbara County. In part, these regulations permit outdoor cultivation of cannabis, including in regions where the primary agriculture are vineyards.

Page 120 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 200 of 348

Attachment 11

Santa Barbara County wine industry stakeholders have expressed concern regarding the potential impacts that outdoor cannabis cultivatic may have on vineyards, winegrapes, and the resulting wines. Concerns focus on the extent that a concentration of terpenes emitted from outdoor cannabis cultivation and proposed odor abatement systems that utilize odor neutralizing essential oils (namely, the system marketed by Byers Scientific & Manufacturing) will be absorbed by winegrapes and ultimately impact resulting wine style and quality. Despite these changes in local policy regarding cannabis cultivation, the federal government has not legalized cannabis and continues to enforce restrictive policies and regulations on research into the impacts of cannabis on both health and public welfare. As a result, research on cannabis generally has been limited in the United States, The effects of cannabis on adjacent crops, including crops with sensitive characteristics like grapes, has also been limited, leaving grape and wine industry stakeholders and policy makers without the cvidence they need to make sound decisions regarding the permitting of outdoor cannabis cultivation and odor abatement systems that utilize essential oils near vineyards and in designated American Viticultural Arcas.
This lack of evidence-based information on the potential impacts of the cannabis industry on established vineyards is a risk to the future viability of the grape and wine industry in Santa in Barbara County and other counties that have or may adopt regulations allowing outdoor cannabis cultivation and/or odor abatement systems that use vaporized essential oils sited near vineyards. Santa Barbara County is currently considering permits for outdoor cannabis cultivation that rely upon vaporized essential oil odor abatement systems which individually and cumulatively could have potentially significant impacts if sited near established vineyards. Until further research can be conducted, the wine industry and policymakers must rely on previously conducted rescarch into how winegrapes react to volatile compounds from the atmosphere to draw conclusions about potential impacts of cannabis and essential oil vapors to existing vineyards and resulting wine quality.

Research has conclusively shown that winegrapes have porous skins and can absorb volatile
compounds from the atmosphere. Well-known examples are volatile phenols from wildfirc smoke (Kennison et al., 2009; Krstic et al., 2015) and Bucalyptol (1,8 cineole) from Eucalyptus et trees (Capone et al., 2012). Rescarch has further shown that cannabis emits volatile terpenes into the atmosphere (Wang et al., 2019). As such, we may use this existing research to analogize and draw conclusions regarding the potential impacts of cannabis terpenes and essential oils on winegrapes.

Impacts of Smoke Taint
In the case of wildfires, large amounts of volatile phenols are relcased into the air during wildfires due to the thermal degradation of lignin in wood. Volatite phenols are naturally synthesized in winegrapes and are also released into wine during barrel aging, as toasting of the oak barrels will release the same compounds. However, during wildfires, the amount of volatile phenols absorbed by the grape berry as well as vine leaves are excessive, resulting in an undesirable effect called "smoke taint" in the wine. This can greatly impact the salability of the impacted winegrapes and can make the resulting wine, if smoke impacted, unmarketable. Smoke taint is characterized as a wine with excessive smnoky aroma and an ashtray-like afterlaste. Additionally, it has been shown that the risk of smoke taint increases with repeated and continual

Page 121 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 201 of 348

Attachment 11

exposure to volatile phenols. These compounds absorb continually on to grapes with each exposure and are stable within the grapes until harvest and processing when these compounds are released within the fermenting must (crushed grapes undergoing alcoholic fermentation). The grape and wine industry have been significantly impacted by smoke exposure in the last three years. Even the current fires in California will impact grapes that were still on the vines when the to fires started (about 5% to 10% depending on the county).
Impacts of Eucalyptus Taint Euçalyptus taint is mainly caused by a terpene called 1,8-cineole or Eucalyptol. Terpencs are large and diverse class of volatile organic compounds, produced by a variety of plants. They often have a strong odor and their function in the plant can be to protect the plant against herbivores or attract pollinators. Because these terpene compounds are "volatile", at ambient temperature they can be released in the air (can evaporate from the plant oils where they are present) and travel with atmospheric conditions. Capone and cowarkers showed during a three- HUA year vineyard study that the Bucalyptus taint in wine was not only caused by 1,8-cineole but also that this terpene originated from Eucalyptu trees nearby vineyards (Capone et al., 2012). Eucalyptus oils consist mostly of 1,8-cineole, although depending on the species this can vary from a 60% to 90% contribution. Eucalyptol in wine is described as a medicinal, camphoraceous, fresh/minty/cool character. In high concentrations this is seen as : taint as it overpowers the wine is and is not a winegrape varietal characteristic. Another study by Capone (Capone et al., 2011) showed that Eucalyptol can also be present in grape skins and MOG (materials other than grapes such as the stems and leaves). Eucalyptol, orl,8-cincole, is present at significant concentrations in the emissions from some strains of cannabis.

Terpenes have very low aroma detection threshold levels and ETS Laboratories determined that the aroma detection threshold level for California Merlot is 1.1 Hg/L. Herve et al., (2003) reported a recognition threshold of 3.2 ug/L in red wine. Irrespective, these are detection threshold levels in the parts per billion range.
The first part of the Capone study focused on making wines from grapes from two different vineyards harvested at set distances from the Eucalypius trees. Their results clearly indicated : large impact due to distance from the terpene source, which in this case is the Eucalyptus trees. Above aroma threshold levels of 1,8-cincole were present in the wines made from grapes up to 50 meters from the Eucalyptus trees. An important fact to remember is that diffusion of volatile compounds depends on several factors including temperature, air pressure and movement. It will diffuse until the environment is in equilibrium. Thus, the distance of travel will depend on initial concentration as well as the listed environmental conditions which will be unique for each site. FLSE In the Capone study, only two sites were utilized, which resulted in different levels of 1,8-cineole in the wines (9.5 - 15.5 Hg/L). The study confirmed the airborne transfer of volatile organic compounds as found by other studies (Kennison et al., 2009). The study also showed that even higher concentrations of 1,8-cineole were present in winegrape stems and leaves, potentially due to their larger surface arca or difference in exposure to the atmosphere or epidermis (outer layer of tissue in a plant). Thus MOG (material other than grapes, including winegrape stems and leaves) can also be a source of 1,8-cineole. This is particularly concerning due to labor costs and
included. shortage which often necessitates the use of mechanical harvesters where more MOG are

Page 122 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 202 of 348

Attachment 11

Capone also found that Eucalyptus leaves and bark can lodge in the grapevines and be included during harvest which made : significant contribution to the 1,8-cineole composition of the wine when included in the must. However, even wines made from hand-picked grapes with no MOG included, including no Eucalyptus leaves and/or bark, produced wines with above aroma threshold levels of 1,8- cineole if made from winegrapes grown within the first 50 meters from Eucalyptus trees. Including grape stems and some grape lcaves as will be normal during most fermentations, will result in even higher levels of 1,8-cineole. This study confirmed that terpenes can become airborne and adsorb on to other plant surfaces such as grape berries, leaves and stems. Similar to smoke taint development, continued exposure will result in an increase in 1,8- cineole in the grapes until harvest. Studies have shown that some cannabis strains can contain high levels of 1,8-cincole which may similarly impact winegrape production (Aizpurua-Olaizola et al., 2016). Cannabis produces large amounts of terpenes (as discussed below) and further rescarch is needed to if determined if any other cannabis-spccific terpenes can adverscly affect wine flavor. Additionally, research is needed to determine mitigation steps if needed.
Terpene Drift and Potential Impact Cannabis plants are known for their strong smell due to high concentrations of a range of different terpenes. The chemotype, growing time, and canopy area effects the concentration of terpenes emitted into the air (mostly monoterpenes, Cio compounds, and sesquiterpenes, Cis compounds). Terpene concentrations in Cannabis plants are in the range of mglg quantities, whereas the threshold levels of these compounds are in the ug/kg range (Aizpurua-Olaizola et in al., 2016). This is a 105 order difference between the cannabis terpene concentration and terpene odor detection levels. Research has shown terpene emission rates of up to 8.7 ugC g' hr! depending on the strain of Cannabis spp (Wang et al., 2019). Additionally, ß-myrcene, eucalyptol and d-limonene were the most dominant terpenes in the emissions for the four strains evaluated. Other important terpenes in cannabis plants are a-pinene, p-pinene, linalool, a- terpineol, - caryophyllene, hashishene, a-humulene and more. New terpenes are continually being identified in cannabis plants.
Terpenes are biosynthesized in winegrapes and can play an important role in the varietal character of a winegrape variety. Additionally, during the winemaking process, yeast and bacteria can also synthesize small amounts of terpenes (Carrau et al., 2016). The specific combination of terpenes present in winegrapes depends on the variety, but the total terpene levels will be in the order of pg/kg and pg/L amounts in winegrapes and wines respectively (Waterhouse et al., 2017). Changing the levet, relative ratio, and combination of terpenes within winegrapes and thus the resulting wines, could change the character of the wine significantly, Additionally, if one terpene or a combination of terpenes overpowers the wine, making it one- dimensional or imparting unplcasant characters to the wine, the wine may be considered tainted. Furthermore, absorption of terpenes on to the winegrapss will be over the full growth period of the winegrapes, which is several months from pea size to maturity. Thus, a build-up effect is possible within the winegrapes. This means that there may be no specific high terpene odor period needed for potential impact on the winegrape's natural terpene composition.

Page 123 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 203 of 348

Attachment 11

Furthermore, research into the effects of nearby Eucalyptus trees on winegrapes showed absorption by winegrapes at I ug/kg to 5 ug/kg levets of Eucalyptol, whereas initial preliminary data on winegrapes show increases of 200 wg/kg to 500 ug/kg of key cannabis terpenes in winegrapes grown close to cannabis plants. This could indicate a much larger impact of cannabis then those determined for Eucalyptus.

Conclusion
Based on the foregoing analysis using the research available to datc on the impacts of airborne volatile compounds on winegrapes, outdoor cannabis cultivation, particularly on large scale with large canopy area, could have a potentially significant impact on the terpene composition of winegrapes grown near such cannabis cultivation sites. Changes to the terpene composition of winegrapes has been shown to impact resulting wine quality. In light of the cultural significance and economic impact of the wine industry in California, it is important that care be taken to avoid adverse impacts while research seeks to provide objective metrics of allowable concentrations and appropriate strains of cannabis grown in proximity to high quality wine grapes.

Re: County of San Luis Obispo Industrial Hemp Ordinance Public Review Draft
Dear Mr. Pedrotti,

Hemp Agricultural & Environmental Research Organization, LLC (HempAERO) is an established agricultural research institution duly formed and registered pursuant to California Food and Agriculture Code Sections 81000, et seq. HempAERO currently grows industrial hemp on AG-zoned farmland in San Luis Obispo County as a part of its research into agricultural best practices. HempAERO's goal is to provide California with the blueprint for a sustainable and beneficial industrial hemp agriculture model. Although HempAERO does not currently engage in indoor processing, our model may evolve to do so in the future.

With that context in mind, we hope that Planning Staff will consider the following comments and thoughts on the County's Industrial Hemp Ordinance Public Review Draft:
Section 22.80.030: It would be helpful if the ordinance could provide a definition of "in the field sales." since those are prohibited. Does it mean that the hemp may not be sold until it is harvested and removed from the field? Or does it mean that sales transactions
may not take place on the same site where industrial hemp is being grown? It would be helpful to have this ambiguity clarified in the ordinance itself. As to the rationale, to we presume that the reason for prohibiting "in the field" sales for industrial hemp but not other types of agricultural crops is due to the testing protocols required for hemp. If that is the case, perhaps that could be addressed in more detail in the Staff Report at the public hearings, so that it does not seem like an arbitrary or discriminatory prohibition.
Definitions: Consider adding : definition for "Outdoor Industrial Hemp Processing" in this list and then cross-referencing to the description of those activities in Section 22.30.070.D.5. Providing a definition for indoor processing but not the contrary may cause confusion for those applicants looking for guidance who only intend to process in outdoors and in hoop houses, before they ever get to Section 22.30.070.D.5. It is also confusing because the ordinance goes on to make multiple references to "Industrial Hemp

445 Green Gate Rd. • San Luis Obispo, CA 93401

Page 125 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 205 of 348

Attachment 11

Processing," but there is no definition for that term, only a definition for "Indoor Industrial Hemp Processing." If an "Outdoor Industrial Hemp Processing" definition is inserted, thereafter, the ordinance should refrain from using the term "industrial hemp processing" without prefacing it with the words "indoor" or "outdoor."
As an alternative, however, the County could simply remnove the word "indoor" from the "Indoor Industrial Hemp Processing" definition, and clarify in that definition that "the drying, curing, trimming, packaging, and preparing for further processing of industrial hemp grown onsite that is performed with mobile equipment and involving non-permanent structures is included under Crop Production and Grazing and is subject to the standards set forth under 22.30.244." Thereafter in the ordinance, it would be clear that all references to "Industrial Hemp Processing" mean processing that takes place in permanent structures.
Section 22.30.070.A.1: Again, as written, the reference here to "industrial hemp processing" requires some distinction between "indoor" and "outdoor." Without this clarification, this section may create confusion about whether a minor use permit is required for an outdoor hemp operation that involved processing before the reader ever gets to the clarifications in subsection D.5.
Section 22.30.070.D.5: Again, under the current definitions, title of this subsection should be prefaced with "indoor," as should all references to "industrial hemp processing" in subparts a-c, below.

Regardless of how the County cleans up the definitions, the words "in the field" in this subsection could be problematic. Although the intent can be reasonably presumed, as a literal and practical matter, the drying, curing, trimming, packaging, and preparation of hemp for further processing does not take place in the same "field" where the hemp is grown. If the words "in the field" are stricken, it will still be clear that all such activities must take place on the same site where the hemp is grown and involve only mobile equipment and non-permanent structures in order to be considered part of crop production and not trigger a minor use permit.

Section 22.30.244.A.1, 3: The prohibition of indoor cultivation on CS and IND lands is perplexing, given that the entire operation will be occurring indoors, and given that industrial hemp processing is allowed on such parcels. Similarly, the requirement that indoor cultivation take place on parcels of at least 5 acres in size seems nonsensical. If the operation is indoors, odors are controlled, and the parcel is appropriately zoned, the size of the parcel is irrelevant. We bring these cognitive dissonances to the County's attention only because, as the science behind hemp cultivation evolves in the future, the County may find it preferable to approve indoor grows in CS or IND areas where they can make use of large, otherwise vacant buildings and be combined with an indoor processing operation.
Section 22.30.244.B.1.A: The required setback of 300 feet from other crop cultivation seems excessive, given that state law has expressly approved industrial hemp as an agricultural commodity, only requires a minimum parcel size of 1/10lh of an acre for seed breeders. (Cal. Food & Ag. Code 81006(a).) We look forward to some scientific justification of this unusually large setback in the Staff Report.
Chapter 22.74.150.G: Given the express statement in Section 22.30.244.C.2 that
producing a crop that tests over the allowable limits for THC shall not constitute a violation of the County Code so long as the remedial actions required by State law are

Page 126 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 206 of 348

Attachment 11

being followed, it is inconsistent and unjustified to require that all industrial hemp activity violations be handled by the Cannabis Hearing Officer. To the contrary, the Cannabis Hearing Officer should be charged with handling only those violations that involve a crop with an unlawful THC content and grower who is not following the remedial actions required by state law. All other violations should be handled in the same manner as any other agricultural product or processing activity.
Respectfully,

To the members of the Board of Supervisors, Planning Commission, and Building and Planning Department, as well as Whom it May Concern;

My name is John Sordelet. I live and operate business in Supervisor Compton's District, who is familiar with me and my site from public meetings last year. I write today to be helpful in this matter. This Hemp Ordinance, if necessary, needs to have the input of the few, registered, local hemp farmers. My experience is limited but true & tested.
Early summer of 2019, I was granted a cultivation permit for Industrial Hemp here in SLO. I was told that the crop was going to look and smell just the same as cannabis. This is only partially true; the plant in its vegetative state, if touched, smells exactly the same. However, during the flowering stage, cannabis becomes very fragrant as THC levels risc. On the other hand, hemp is missing the concentrated THC ingredient (chemical) that produces the pungent, familiar cannabis smell. The flowers of Hemp do not smell just like cannabis, they are much less odoriferous. The whole smell issue is not the same as cannabis. This info is based on the five different Hemp cultivators I registered and trialed this year,
Now that I have had a successful year 2019 and have committed full time to my hemp farm, any changes to my existing site could be detrimental to my family owned and operated business. There to is no reason for that to happen. I have two concerns in the draft I must address:
First, the draft states that hoop-structures would not be allowed for drying the crop. This is totally uncalled for. This crop, grown for CBD, can and should be grown like a cut-flower for maximum quality control and medical value. This means it needs to be harvested differently that other field crops. Hoop structures are designed and used for climate control and storage. They are cost effective, easy on the eyes, and multifunctional. There is no sound reasoning to not allow an agricultural structure for agricultural use with this one crop. The hoop structure is one of many non- permanent, enginecred structures used for agricultural purposes, to alleviate the costs farmers face
producing various commodities. The cut-flower industry in the USA has been almost lost to South America due to the many costs of production. Let's make sure that our San Luis Obispo cut flower experts have a new outlet for their skills, unlimited by unnecessary restrictions.
Secondly, I see a set-back recommendation for wetlands and riparian areas. For 18 years now ] have been expanding my very small farm as all farmers that can, do. I have had the opportunity to see the County, State, and USDA management of the riparian area where I have lived these years. I also have had the NRCS and Fish & wildlife out on-site several times and been advised. I have farmed the same fields where my hemp crop was grown for many years. Activities Fish & Wildlife consider to have 'environmental impact' and 'heavy equipment' use in the riparian arcas have a 25 foot set-back. This is the Standard and other farmers, contractors, excavators have been held to. I am aware of a
100 ft setback for septic leach fields, not crops. Look as you drive through the beautiful Central Coast vineyards and farms; there is a 25 foot setback standard to drive and work between crops and the riparian creeks and water flows everywhere crops are grown. There is no reason for this crop and its farms to have any discriminatory standards differing from that of other existing crops and farms.
Thank you for the opportunity to share my experiences and thoughts.
Sincerely,

John Sordelet

To Whom May Concern:

I'm 31-year SLO County resident, a 5th generation farmer/rancher, a local business owner,
and Cal Poly alum. I believe hemp should be treated like every other row crop. The
proposed setbacks are onerous and they'Il significantly hinder farmers' ability to grow hemp in SLO County.

An appropriate setback from wine tasting facilities is 0". Hemp farming is agriculture and ag zoned land should be used for farming. Wine tasting room facilities can be located
anywhere-why protect their interests over the interests of farmers who want to grow food, fiber, and medicine on ag zoned land? Is it because 'Big Wine' has undue influence on County policymaking?
An appropriate setback from active crops of other ownership is 0". Bad actors who regularly is practice over-spraying pesticides and contaminate their neighbors' land and crops ought to be enforced upon. It's preposterous to protect the interests of these irresponsible farmers over the interests of farmers who want to grow hemp to fill the consumer demand for
organic hemp seed oil and organic CBD medicine.

Hemp is a boon for small family farmers. A few acres of CBD-rich hemp can provide a living- what other crop can be grown profitably on a small scale? Struggling farmers like me want to grow hemp, please don't take away our opportunity to participate in this new industry by imposing unreasonable regulations on local hemp farmers.

Hemp is quickly becoming an important tool for carbon mitigation in our struggle against global climate disaster. Cement accounts for 8% of total global carbon emissions yet
hempcrete (hemp-based concrete) is carbon negative! One SLO County contractor is currently in the process of establishing a hemp manufacturing facility in Santa Margharita to process whole hemp plant into hempcrete lego blocks for fire-safe, earthquake-safe, carbon- negative building. Several more exciting projects just like this are evolving right now right here in SLO County and it would be tragic to crush these entrepreneurs' opportunity to bring environmentally sustainable economic development to our County.

Thank you for your consideration,

Megan Souza

ATTENTION: This email originated from outside the County's network. Use caution when opening attachments or links.

The Board of Supervisors is to be thanked for the current moratorium on approving new plantings of hemp in San Luis Obispo County. As I stated in my first note to the Board this summer there isn't a lot of scientific study on this crop as there is for produce, fruit, or grapes so we really don't know the short and long-term effects.

Having grown up in the area and a business owner in San Luis Obispo Country since 2008 with
employees in the Edna Valley where we farm our vineyards, have winery operations, along with tasting rooms and event areas we are concerned with the proposed Country of San Luis Obispo Industrial Hemp Ordinance as drafted. This response is being sent to you and the planning staff to make sure all parties know our concerns with the draft as asked.

Currently conversation in our area is about what is happening in other areas around the state as they granted approval without drafting the proper regulations for insuring the Health and Environmental Concerns, Noise Pollution, Air Quality Degradation and side effects on sustainable Farming. More and more individuals are getting concerned as the effects are being understood. The Board of Supervisors thoughtfully has asked for this to be addressed by the planning staff.
Having read the draft legislation what is needed for the ordinance to be effective, it must be enforceable along with the responsible organization or organizations having the proper equipment, funding and authority to hold violators accountable in a timely manner. This was not addressed
adequately in the planned ordinance. It is no secret that the valley has those that don't follow the rules and frustration exists with the lack of enforceability and compliance. In essence it encourages some to operate out side the rules.
of Which ties to the concern of sustainable farming. Established crops in the valley spray for things we all understand like mildew for example. It's given that we experience this condition in the Edna Valley. Given our transverse valley with various wind patterns the set back is inadequate for those of us that have been doing business in the area. A set back of 300 feet is inadequate it's only a football field away. I have been looking for the scientific proof why this is the right distance. Which is back to my initial point it doesn't exist. So why would you not make this a larger setback number or restrict plantings until you have facts and data. The county puts its self at risk and others at risk with lax standards and litigation as the only answer.

Finally, direction was provided to the staff to address the following issues which the draft ordinance does not properly address which are the health issues, event centers, churches, schools, and residences that are in AG zoned properties.

RE: COUNTY OF SAN LUIS OBISPO INDUSTRIAL HEMP ORDINANCE PUBLIC REVIEW
DRAFT

Dear Sirs,

Thank you for this opportunity to make comment on the Industrial Hemp Ordinance Public
Review Draft.

On a general note, whatever form the ordinance ultimately takes, is should be harmonized
with the Cannabis Ordinance given virtually all of the impacts are identical.
My comments here are inspired by the recent hemp grows in the Los Osos Valley and the
deleterious impacts they presented in the valley over these past six (6) months.
1. Water - all hemp farms, inland or coastal, should be required to offset their water use. Hemp grows in adjudicated basins (i.e. Los Osos, etc.) and in impaired basins
(i.e. San Luis Obispo Basin, etc.) should be required to offset their use on a 2:1 ratio
to actually help improve the management of the basins. These offsets should be
accomplished through changes with other agricultural activity.

2. Watercourse - setbacks from watercourses should be no less than 100 feet. The
operations associated with cultivation trigger soil disturbance that runs off into
these waterways. Drainage plans including best management practices and
mitigations should be put in place as part of the conditions of approval for each
project.

3. Watershed • Hemp farm equipment and vehicles tracked out soil and mud during
the entire operation, especially when the rains began. This track out gets carried
down the road by passing traffic only to end up as dust in the air and/or silt in the
watershed.

4. Visual - acres of plastic on the ground, hoop houses, security screening and
windscreens obstruct the views from the passersby. Screening should be natural
(trees/shrubs) and grow structures (hoop houses or green houses) should be
agrarian in architectural style.

From the Desk of Julie Tacker

5. Odors - no offsite odors should be detected, as with the Cannabis Ordinance.

6. Greenhouse Gas (AB 32) - "Plasticulture" or ag plastics include soil fumigation film,
irrigation drip tape/tubing, nursery pots and silage bags, this term is most often
used to describe all kinds of plastic plant/soil coverings. The appearance is the
various plastic materials are being used one time. These plastics are prevalent in the
operation of hemp and cannabis; including on the ground, hoop houses, drip
irrigation, potted seedlings, windscreens and more. Tons of plastic exposed to the
elements break down in the sun and wind where its particles enter the air and
watercourses. These tons of plastic are not recycled and are hauled and dumped at
the local landfill. These impacts should be calculated and offset with mitigations in connection with Green House Gases and the respective carbon foot print.

Again, thank you for the opportunity to comment.
Please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have.

Sincerely,
QuisIcker

Iam writing to express my grave concern about the prospect of cannabis/hemp growing in the Edna Valley. My wife and I have lived and worked in the Edna Valley since our arrival in California 1n 1981. We specifically chose the Edna Valley because of its pristine reputation as one of the precious few sites of fine wine growing in California, or in the world for that matter.
Under our family label "Claiborne & Churchill" we have been making wine from Edna Valley
grapes since 1983, and we have built our winemaking reputation on the unique quality of the
grapes grown here, We built our pioneering Straw Bale winery and planted our Estate Riesling Vineyard here, adjacent to our home, in the heart of the Edna Valley. While I have no moral or entrepreneurial objections to cannabis or hemp growing, I am worried that it poses a threat to our livelihood. Like others, I have noticed the skunk odors wafting in
from neighboring crops, off-putting enough to singlehandedly send our robust wine tourism
(reputation and income!) into a tailspin. The prospect of terpene taint from nearby cannabis/hemp crops would signal the demise of my and my neighbors' businesses altogether. I respectfully urge you to tackle this threat before it gets out of hand.

The 300 foot setback from residences will be inadequate. We have experienced health and quality of life impacts in neighborhoods in Ventura County that are 600 feet from growing fields. The County Supervisors are struggling to find the correct setback distance required. We
currently have a moratorium on any cultivation within 1/2 mile from any existing residential
community. If you enact the 300 foot setback, you will be addressing this item again in the future. I have much more information on this subject and I will be advocating for fair and safe farming practices in Ventura County. I hope this helps you.

Dear San Luis Obispo County Honorable Board of Supervisors,

The pollen created from hemp cultivation threatens the value and enormous
tax revenue that will be generated from the 141 cannabis cultivation sites that
will in due time be approved and established in San Luis Obispo County. A
conservative estimate of the 4% tax revenue for County coffers is $35,532,000 based on a very low $300 per pound for dried cannabis biomass. Add to this all the other economic benefits from 141 successful, legal, cannabis
operations and 10 mile minimum is an easy decision. is
Because of this, I am writing to urge you to establish a minimum of a 10 mile
set back for hemp cultivation from any permitted cannabis cultivation
operation.

In Colorado, hemp cultivation in areas as far as 30 miles away have been
causing massive damage and devaluation to high value, tax generating
cannabis operations. see the following -
https://www.leafly.com/news/industry/legal-hemp-pollen-drift

According to Anndrea Hermann, an international hemp expert, the minimum
safe distance is 10 miles. see the following -
https://www.thecannabist.co/2015/06/18/safe-distance-hemp-marijuana-
pollination/33130/

Additionally, because thousands of acres of hemp are growing and being
planted in lower cost states, the value of CBD Hemp has already dropped to under $30,000 per acre which isn't much more than that of snap peas. Any
upside for hemp cultivation in our county will be short lived at best.

Please consider these factors when you establish your set back minimums for
hemp.

Comments on Ordnance:

Before addressing the specifics of the ordnance a comment on my experience. have sent notes to the supervisors before regarding the smell from the hemp. Many times when | go outdoors I have an overpowering smell that makes my eyes water.

Generally the ordnance does not address the concerns of the citizens, particularly of Edna
Valley.

Nuisance Odors: this term is not defined leaving each situation up to interpretation from different parties. In addition it appears it is only addressed for indoor growth and processing, what about the nuisance odor from outdoor growth. In addition odors are present even when the crop is not in bloom.

Setback: A setback of 300 feet is meaningless. I am not sure how far the hemp is from my property at this point but clearly have a nuisance odor. I would think that a mile setback
would possibly mitigate the odor but am not an expert on scent traveling in the air, however 300 feet clearly does not mitigate the impact.
Residences in ag zones: It is not acceptable to have no setback for residences in agriculture zoned areas. While hemp may currently be categorized as an agriculture crop is it quite different from what is currently grown in the Edna Valley. It clearly has nuisance odor and no one is yet sure of its potential impact on other crops. A significant setback is needed for
residences.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment. I would be happy to provide any further comment

Notice of General Rule Exemption

Project Title and No.: Industrial Hemp Ordinance LRP2019-0008

Pursuant to section 15061 of the State California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines, the
preliminary review of a project includes a determination as to whether a project is exempt from CEQA. This checklist represents a summary of this project's review for exemption.

YES NO

1. Does this project fall within any exempt class as listed in sections 15301 through 15329 of the
State CEQA Guidelines? 0 X

2. Is there a reasonable possibility that the project could have a significant effect on the
environment due to unusual circumstances? 0 x

is the project inconsistent with any Federal, State, or local law or administrative requirement
relating to the environment? 0 x

4. Will the project involve substantial public controversy regarding environmental issues? x

5. Does the project have the potential to degrade the quality of the environment, substantially
reduce the habitat of a fish or wildlife species, cause a fish or wildlife population to drop below
self-sustaining levels, threaten to eliminate a plant or animal community, reduce the number 0 X
or restrict the range of a rare or endangered plant or animal or eliminate important examples
of the major periods of California history or prehistory?

Does the project have the potential to achieve short-term environmental goals to the
disadvantage of achieving long-term environmental goals? (A short-term impact on the environment is one which occurs in a relatively brief, definitive period of time while long-term 0 x
impacts will endure well into the future.)

7. Does the project have adverse impacts which are individually insignificant, but cumulatively
significant? Cumulatively significant means that the incremental effects of an individual project are substantially adverse when viewed in connection with the effects of past projects, 0 x
the effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable future projects.

8. Does the project have environmental effects which will cause substantial adverse effects on
human beings, either directly or indirectly? 0 x

On the basis of this initial evaluation, I find that the proposed project does not have the potential to cause a
significant effect on the environment, and is therefore exempt from CEQA.

Subject: [EXT]Draft Hemp Ordinance

ATTENTION: This email originated from outside the County's network. Use caution when opening attachments or links.
Mr. Moras and Mr. Pedrotti:

In the near future, you will be asking the Planning Commission to amend it's ordinances as they pertain to the growing of hemp in San Luis Obispo County. I have issues with what has been presented, primarily with what has happened recently and how your proposed ordinance changes would address and resolve the issues.
We are residents of the County for 38 years. For the past 20 years we have owned a parcel a on the southern border of the Edna Valley next to the Cold Canyon Landfill, and lived on it for 15 years as residents.
After being out of the area for a few weeks this last September, we returned the first of October. On October 2nd, my wife smelled hemp/cannabis odors for about 1 hour that were coming from the primary grower in the middle of the Edna Valley. We are 5,800 feet from the hemp/cannabis grow site and 6,300 feet from the hemp growing site. For purposes of this letter, I will use the 5,800 foot distance as the distance to the odor site.
sent a complaint to the County, the Board of Supervisors, the individual Board members, the APCD, the AG
Commissioner's office, and the Planning Department.

The only response was from the APCD, who said that since the CA Department of Food and Agriculture has identified cannabis (which includes hemp) as an agricultural product, that have no jurisdiction as agricultural crops are specifically exempted from APCD regulation dealing with nuisance odors.
There was no response from the AG Commissioner's office.

On October 4th, I smelled the hemp/cannabis again, this time for an extended period of about 4 hours. It was smelled by four other people. It was at a higher elevation than the first complaint. I did not report it, because the first nuisance complaint was pending for a County response. That response was never received.
cite this experience, because it should cause the staff and the decision makers to pause and ask the question, "How does the proposed ordinance address this type of complaint? Would it have been dealt with and resolved?"

Contrary to the comment by one Board member questioning the possibility that these odors could travel over a mile, the odors did travel over a mile. In the case of the first complaint, 5,800 feet. This was at the floor of the Valley, which is about 40 feet above the elevation of the hemp grow site. For the second complaint, it was smelled at an elevation of 420', 120' above the elevation of the grow sites.
1. Enforcement. Clearly, right now there is no enforcement. Unless something changes, the status quo will remain. No enforcement. Parts of new enforcement issues are just now being developed at the State and Federal levels, dealing with testing protocals, time of testing, etc. Counties are rethinking their Ordinances. Initial rushes to adopt have been shown to be fraught with errors, as evidenced by Buellton, Carpinteria, and the rest of Santa Barbara County's issues, Oregon school issues, Monterey County's almost complete banning of the products except in remote areas, Napa Valley issues, even former Lieutenant Governor' Maldonado's SLO testing protocal issues to name a few. a

Attachment 11

2. Nuisance Odors- Processing. Section 22.30.070.D.5.b states:
"Nuisance Odors. All Industrial hemp processing facilities shall be sited and/or operated a in a manner that prevents hemp nuisance odors from being detected offsite. An odor management plan shall be submitted with the use permit application that demonstrates how nuisance odor will be controlled to be undetectable offsite."

Since I have detected nuisance odors, reported them, and I am 5,800 feet away, that means no industrial hemp processing facilities can be sited where they are today. It had to be hemp, because if it were cannabis, under 22.74.150.G, the AG Department would be going through the Nuisance Abatement Hearings. I have heard nothing on this potential action.
If the grower was doing processing, what have they (the Ag Department) done to the growing site's Odor Management Plan to make odors undetectable at my home (as it's the offsite location)? If nothing, the Ordinance needs some tweaking.
3. Nuisance Odors- Cultivation- Outdoors. Section 22/30.244.B.2 (Hemp Cultivation) states an odor control requirement for indoor growing, but is mute on outdoor growing. You now have a complaint from 1-1/4 miles away on an outdoor grow, so what will the control requirement be for outdoor grows? The setback of 300 feet clearly will not work for control, as it has been it "busted".
With this omission, the County staff is condemning every citizen and business living, operating or being within 5,800 feet of a hemp site of having to put up with these odors. That is a very big radius, and the smell is not pleasant.

Proponents of growing cannabis and/or hemp try to point out that odoriferous vegetables like broccoli, are allowed to grow under Right to Farm Ordinances. However, those other products have been grown for decades here, most likely longer than the County Planning Ordinances even existed. Hemp is a new product.
The AG Ordinance that protects older crops states:

Section 5.16.031. Pre-existing Agricultural Processing Uses Not a Nuisance

(2) If an agricultural processing activity, operation, facility, or appurtenances thereof substantially increased its activities or operations after January 1, 1993, then a public or private nuisance action may be brought with respect to those increases in activities or operations that have a significant effect on the environment. For increases in activities or operations that have been in effect more than three years, there is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence that the increase was not substantial

Hemp does not meet this standard. It is not pre-existing. A public or private nuisance action may be brought.
If broccoli were introduced today, it most likely would not be approved, or as Monterey County did with hemp, approved but isolated to an unpopulated area.
believe the best way to deal with this issue would be to increase the setback to a greater distance, reflective of the complaints received to date across the State. The 300 foot distance is not based on science, statistics, or real world data. If I am wrong, please provide the hard backup data a showing 300' is a statistically significant answer. I would like to offer setting the setback to 2,640 feet (1/2 mile), as believe the County would eliminate in one fell swoop maybe 70% of the potential complaints.
Then in five years, revisit the ordinance to see what complaints were received, and statistically set the setback distance to protect a certain percentage of the population based on distance. Maybe use the figure that would eliminate 80% of the individual locations complaining of odors.

Page 143 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 223 of 348

Attachment 11

4. Facilities included in Setback Limits (22.30.244.B.1.a). Permitted Event Centers should be added as an
operation to be avoided. "Permitted" because those operations have gone through County review and should
be protected.
5. Setbacks for Indoor Hemp Cultivation (22.30.244.B.1.b). 100 feet for a setback is not enough. All the "indoor" part does (the roof and walls) is concentrate and intensify the odors so that when they are released,
they are concentrated more than an open outdoor grow that just continually emits the same amount but over a longer time. I suggest that a distance that is 50% of the outdoor setback be used.
I hope that you take these comments under consideration. Thank you very much.

Dear Director Trevor Keith,

I am writing to you to strongly request that you permanently ban Marijuana and Hemp growing from the
productive, yet fragile Edna Valley.

I understand why some economic pressure may be against this.
However, I strongly believe any significant risk to our valley for Grape Production, for delightful venues and for property values must be avoided.

I am hoping you will do the right thing.

Specifically:

1. Planting of Hemp and Marijuana in the fragile and unique Edna Valley
should be permanently banned
2. A 400-foot setback is clearly inadequate based on Oregon experience -
at 1600 feet, it should be at least 1 mile. The foggy, calm evenings in
the EV, during growing season, will accumulate and magnify deleterious
effects.
3. All planting of Hemp in the County should be banned until impacts have
been studied and understood; leading to county Ordnances regulating such
plantings
4. This will require at least 6 months of studies and assessments of the
experiences and techniques in other states and quantifying economic risk to
SLO county
5. Failure to completely understand this situation will place substantial
economic risk on wine, wine-tasting, event hosting and property values in any
area_that must coexist with Hemp planting.

An Experience in Oak Grove, Oregon
For several weeks, a neighbor's skunky smell filled the air, and students at Oak Grove Elementary complained that their heads hurt and they felt nauseated.
Staff, too, were not pleased. They said the odor followed them to their vehicles and homes.
From September through October, people at Oak Grove said, they were constantly aware that their neighbors were hemp farms ready for
harvest.
"Many staff, students and families have significant concerns about
noxious odor during the harvest season and its impact on the health of
the students and the staff," said Michelle Cummings, Medford School District chief academic officer.
Hemp plants, cousins to marijuana, often release strong smells as their flavor-producing terpenes reach maturity. The scent of even a few rows of plants can travel far, and Oak Grove is within a quarter-mile of at least two industrial hemp grows.
What would be the impact on Tasting Rooms and Weddings?

These comments are further to my comments to the BOS on June 17, 2019 (3:40 pm). AsI indicated therein, I have lived at 6235 Orcutt Rd (corner of Biddle and Orcutt) for over 34 years. I co-founded Tolosa Winery (35 full time employees and up to 85 during harvest) and planted and own with the Baggetts over 700 acres of grapes here in the Edna Valley (providing full time employment to 20 workers and up to 100 during harvest). In my June letter, expressed certain concerns, principally the noxious odors emitted from hemp, the migration of hemp terpenes onto my grapes, causing "skunk" taint on the grapes, and the decrease in value of my property. What I did not anticipate were the adverse health effects I experienced in the fall when a hemp grow was flowering. This grow-2,000 feet away--caused severe watering of my eyes and uncontrollable sneezing when the wind was blowing my way. My neighbors had similarly complained and frankly, I was skeptical. No longer. This problem will be exacerbated when hemp operations reach full scale with 3-4 harvests per year--and a flowering season of 1-2 months with each grow.
see real inconsistencies in policies between the Cannabis Ordinance (marijuana) and the draft Hemp Ordinance, probably attributable to the staff having to move way too fast, in the face of so many unknowns. For example:

in the Cannabis Ordinance, the County recognized the deleterious effects of offsite odors for both indoor and outdoor grows. Accordingly, it prohibited ANY offsite odors and required all applicants to submit an odor management plan to show how the operation would prevent offsite odors. While the draft Hemp Ordinance prohibits offsite odors from indoor hemp grows, it does not do so for outdoor grows. This makes no sense because marijuana grows are limited to 3 acres, while hemp grows are unlimited in size. The larger the grow, the more intense the odor problem. For consistency, the hemp ordinance should also prohibit offsite odors. The draft hemp ordinance also fails to require a "statement of neighborhood compatibility" together with a plan to address
potential compatibility issues. There are 3 verifiable concerns from hemp terpenes:

1. noxious odors:
2. adverse health effects; 3. the real threat of "skunk" taint> (See my letter of behalf of the Edna Valley Growers MWC dated December 19, 2019, enclosing Prof Oberholster's opinion concerning the risks of terpene drift onto grapes).
In contrast, the draft Hemp Ordinance places no burden on the hemp grower to demonstrate a plan to address the incompatibilities of bringing in a new crop to the Edna Valley. Instead, it assumes the burden should be on existing vineyard owners, tasting room owners and event center owners to provide scientific evidence to support their concerns. Who should have the burden of proof here? After the vineyard industry (and related event centers) has invested well over $100M, should not the hemp growers have the burden to prove hemp will not harm the existing ag owners? We know that even the perception of "skunk" taint has resulted in vineyard owners losing sales contracts. Moreover, the Cannabis Ordinance squarely places the burden on the cannabis grower--so should the Hemp Ordinance.

Page 156 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 236 of 348

Attachment 11

The Cannabis industry has been banned for 7 decades. Hemp growing just in the last few years became legal as a federal matter; and several states have legalized marijuana. So, there is a real scarcity of studies dealing with the compatibility of cannabis on existing crops, businesses and residences, as well as health effects on cannabis workers in the field and ag field workers nearby.
Neither the setbacks specified in the Hemp Ordinance300 feet or some other number - nor the specification of site size is based on science or experience. 10 acres seems to be just an arbitrary number and could just as well be 100. Additionally, the 300 foot setback for the Hemp Ordinance was simply adopted from the Cannabis ordinance. But the 300 feet in the Cannabis ordinance is the minimum setback because the process involves a discretionary permit---so the neighbors can argue for a greater setback, whereas the 300 foot setback in the Hemp Ordinance is the maximum -the process is a ministerial over the counter exercise No discretion to lengthen the setback. This is another discrepancy between the two ordinances.
Also, the Cannabis Ordinance measures the setback from the grower's property line. The Hemp draft measures from the edge of the grow to the edge of the residence. Another discrepancy.
Another shortcoming of the Hemp Ordinance: lack of meaningful enforcement. The elephant in the room is the lack of resources to enforce. Violators to date have been running circles around county enforcement efforts and will continue to do so. Lip service to enforcement is not sufficient. Much larger staff and resources for testing equipment are required for an honest commitment to enforcement. Enforcement will in any event be difficult. For example, the Hemp draft provides that outdoor cultivation "will be limited to non-flowering transplants only". Try and enforce that one
Bottom line: No other crop grown in the Edna Valley can be grown into an illegal product except hemp. Given all of the above, I respectfully urge that hemp should be prohibited from the Edna Valley.

Facts re: the Edna Valley Appellation and Hemp

1. There are 3 federally approved appellations in the County: Paso Robles (660,000 acres);
Arroyo Grande (39,646 acres) and Edna Valley (18,970 acres excluding the City of SLO)
2. The County land mass is 2,111,360 acres. The Edna Valley is a small valley--it represents just 0.008 of the total acreage in the County. It has a high concentration of vineyards,
wineries, tasting rooms, and event centers. Also, Los Ranchos School and several dense
neighborhoods and ranchettes throughout the Valley. 3. The Edna Valley is unique in California: (a) it is the coldest appellation in California; (b) it is the only appellation with 2 transverse valleys open to the ocean (Morro Bay-Los Osos
and Pismo Beach) and (c) it has the longest grape growing season in California with bud
break in Feb and harvest to Nov.
4. Because the Edna Valley is truly a valley, generally surrounded by hills, its climatic
characteristics are uniform throughout the Valley. This differs from the "open" Paso
Robles and Arroyo Grande appellations where the western and eastern portions have
dramatically different temperatures, fog and wind. For example, Growing Degree Days ("GDD") for Paso Robles west and east range from 31.17 to 3342 (F). For Edna Valley,
the GDD is relatively constant 2371 (F). (Note: The GDD numbers were provided by UC Ag Extension, based on 24-hour monitoring. With only one monitoring station in the Arroyo Grande appellation, no GDD range could be provided).
5. With marine air from 2 sources, the Edna Valley experiences relatively high amounts of fog and wind from March to November, as compared to the Paso Robles and Arroyo Grande appellations. Wind records show windy conditions 2/3's of the time-average
7-8 MPH-and 20-30 MPH peak all year. Also, the winds predominately come from 2 directions, thereby creating a mix of wind influence, which is recipe for broad distribution of hemp terpenes over large distances. Recent flowering from a hemp grow in the Valley was detected over 1 mile in several directions from the grow.
The foggy conditions in the Edna Valley-near stagnant air mass-- also promote
migration of hemp terpenes once the winds kick in later in the day.
6. Health effects: this flowering from hemp grow this fall in the Edna Valley caused respiratory problems and insomnia for many residents up to 1 mile from the grow. Many complaints were lodged with the County. Odors from cauliflower and broccoli don't have these adverse effects on neighbors.
7. "Smoke" taint from wildfires unfortunately is a reality. The 'smoke" taint from wildfires
in No Calif has caused immense monetary losses to the wine industry, due to cancellation of contracts and rejection of grape after the wildfires.
8. The predominant terpene in Cannabis (whether marijuana or hemp) is myrcene which emits the strongly noxious "skunk" taint. At the July hearing on the hemp moratorium, we expressed serious concern over the threat of terpene drift on to vineyards resulting in unmerchantable grapes. We were told by the industry they we were engaging in "fear mongering". But it turns out the fear of "skunk" taint is well founded. Please see the
attached Oct 28, 2019 opinion letter from Prof. Oberholtser, U.C.Davis, in which she describes that the deleterious effect of smoke volatiles and eucalyptus terpenes have had on grapes and the resulting end product-wine. She strongly suggests the cannabis

Attachment 11

terpenes may have the same adverse effect on grapes, and wine. With the foggy
conditions and near continual winds in our "true" valley, the risk of terpene drift is
higher than any other location in this County, 9. Prof. Oberholseter stresses the need for research before risking the viability of the
vineyard industry. But even without definitive research, the fear of "skunk" taint is
taking its toll. In Oregon, grape contracts have been cancelled for fear of "skunk" taint
from a marijuana grow on adjacent property. Why would a grape buyer risk "skunk"
taint, especially when the defect in the wine may appear much later? Oregon legalized
before Calif and forecasts the future for us.
10. Cannabis growers in Santa Barbara County have threatened and sued over spray drift -
cannabis is very sensitive to pesticides, insecticides and fungicides. In fact, this issue of
is spray drift is even greater in the Edna Valley due to its foggy and windy conditions. The best conditions for spraying are in the morning before the wind picks up. But on foggy
mornings the sprays can be suspended in the fog and then distributed when the wind
picks up. We can learn from the experience in Santa Barbara. There avocado and citrus growers have been forced to curtail or reduce spraying due to claims/threats from the cannabis growers. These threats have already stopped companies from aerial spraying. And growers have now eliminated spraying near any cannabis grow, just letting some of their crops fail for fear of a lawsuit. In one case, a vineyard owner in
Santa Barbara was sued for fungicide driftshe then went organic and lost her crop to
mildew.
11. Vineyards and orchards face existential threats from insects such as the Asian citrus
psyllid, the glassy winged sharpshooter etc. To save these permanent crops, we need to
use insecticides, and in the case of citrus, need to use "air blasters" to cover the
trees. Introducing hemp into the Edna Valley would obviously inhibit these "lifesaving"
measures.
12. The Edna Valley is extremely susceptible to Powdery-Mildew. Combined with a very long growing season, the amount of spraying to prevent Powdery Mildew is more than triple the number of sprays a vineyard in the North County receives. This means the Edna Valley grape growers will face far greater risk of spray drift than other growers in
the County.
13. In the Edna Valley, approximately $140,000,000 has been invested in wine grapes -a
permanent crop-together with associated wineries, tasting rooms and event center- supporting a large ag tourism industry. Why risk this long-term investment for a seasonal crop, before definitive research is completed? 14. 25 counties prohibit hemp. Napa is banning both hemp and marijuana. Monterey severely restricts hemp in a pilot program. Some counties and states severely restrict hemp due to concerns of cross-pollination-cannot be grown within 5 miles of marijuana (Washington state) and 4 miles in Yolo County.

RE: Potential impact of terpene drifi-Ngiape Ahd 54Rä F8hposition HEAMING SOPPORT
Introduction

am a faculty member in the Department of Viticulture and Enology at University of California, Davis California. My Department is ranked number one in the world and combines the sciences of viticulture and enology in a single research and teaching unit that encompasses all of the scientific disciplines that impact grape growing and winemaking. The faculty roster includes scientists from the fields of chemistry, genetics, microbiology, chemical engineering, horticulture, biochemistry, plant physiology, and sensory science. Multidisciplinary and strategic research and teaching programs cover all major aspects of viticulture and enology. The Department's research is aimed at expanding knowledge of the factors that impact grape and wine characters so that the wincmaking processes could be tailored by individual winemakers to achieve the desired flavor and aroma profiles in the finished wine. This allowed the industry to move beyond mere commercial acceptability to the production of intricately crafted fine wines. Objective methods of sensory evaluation of wines were developed in the Department that is now widely used throughout the food and beverage industries. Descriptive analysis of wines has now become a standard procedure for wine evaluation and has had the added benefit of making wines less intimidating for the consumer. Marketplace interest in wine has further increased due to recent Department research that point to various components in wine that may have beneficial human health effects.

Today, there are considerable concerns regarding the adverse effect that high concentrations of certain terpenes can have on wine flavor, including terpenes commonly emitted from cannabis plants. Some common cannabis terpenes are associated with other • plants and have been demonstrated to adversely affect wine quality.

The California grape and wine industry is a $31.9 billion a dollar industry, with 637,000 acres of winegrapes planted. Based on a Stonebridge Research report published in December 2015, the Santa Barbara County wine industry has a $1.7 billion dollar economic impact on the region, Recent legislation adopted by the Santa Barbara County Board of Supervisors established regulations for the cultivation of recreational cannabis within the unincorporated regions of the Santa Barbara County, In part, these regulations permit outdoor cultivation of cannabis, including in regions where the primary agriculture are vineyards.

Page 160 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 240 of 348

Attachment 11

Santa Barbara County wine industry stakeholders have expressed concern regarding the potential impacts that outdoor cannabis cultivation may have on vineyards, winegrapes, and the resulting wines. Concerns focus on the extent that a concentration of terpenes emitted from outdoor cannabis cultivation and proposed odor abatement systems that utilize odor neutralizing essential oils (namely, the system marketed by Byers Scientific & Manufacturing) will be absorbed by winegrapes and ultimately impact resulting wine style and quality. Despite these changes in local policy regarding cannabis cultivation, the federal government has not legalized cannabis and continues to enforce restrictive policies and regulations on research into the impacts of cannabis on both health and public welfare. As a result, research on cannabis generally has been limited in the United States. The effects of cannabis on adjacent crops, including crops with sensitive characteristics like grapes, has also been limited, leaving grape and wine industry stakeholders and policy makers without the evidence they need to make sound decisions regarding the permitting of outdoor cannabis cultivation and odor abatement systems that utilize essential oils near vineyards and in designated American Viticultural Areas,
This lack of evidence-based information on the potential impacts of the cannabis industry on established vineyards is a risk to the future viability of the grape and wine industry in Santa Barbara County and other counties that have or may adopt regulations allowing outdoor cannabis cultivation and/or odor abatement systems that use vaporized essential oils sited near vineyards. Santa Barbara County is currently considering permits for outdoor cannabis cultivation that rely upon vaporized essential oil odor abatement systems which individually and cumulatively could have potentially significant impacts if sited near established vineyards. Until further research can be conducted, the wine industry and policymakers must rely on previously conducted research into how winegrapes react to volatile compounds from the atmosphere to draw conclusions about potential impacts of cannabis and essential oil vapors to existing vineyards and resulting wine
quality.

Research has conclusively shown that winegrapes have porous skins and can absorb volatile compounds from the atmosphere. Well-known examples are volatile phenols from wildfire smoke (Kennison et al., 2009; Krstic et al., 2015) and Eucalyptol (1,8 cineole) from Eucalyptus trees (Capone et al., 2012). Research has further shown that cannabis emits volatile terpenes into the atmosphere (Wang et al., 2019). As such, we may use this existing research to analogize and draw conclusions regarding the potential impacts of cannabis terpenes and essential oils on winegrapes.

Impacts of Smoke Taint In the case of wildfires, large amounts of volatile phenols are released into the air during wildfires due to the thermal degradation of lignin in wood. Volatile phenols are naturally synthesized in winegrapes and are also released into wine during barrel aging, as toasting of the oak barrels will release the same compounds. However, during wildfires, the amount of volatile phenols absorbed by the grape berry as well as vine leaves are excessive, resulting in an undesirable effect called "smoke taint" in the wine. This can greatly impact the salability of the impacted winegrapes and can make the resulting wine, if smoke impacted, unmarketable. Smoke taint is characterized as a wine with excessive smoky aroma and an ashtray-like aftertaste. Additionally, it has been shown that the risk of smoke taint increases with repeated and continual

Page 161 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 241 of 348

Attachment 11

exposure to volatile phenols. These compounds absorb continually on to grapes with each exposure and are stable within the grapes until harvest and processing when these compounds are released within the fermenting must (crushed grapes undergoing alcoholic fermentation). The grape and wine industry have been significantly impacted by smoke exposure in the last three years. Even the current fires in California will impact grapes that were still on the vines when the fires started (about 5% to 10% depending on the county).
Impacts of Eucalyptus Taint Eucalyptus taint is mainly caused by terpene called 1,8-cineole or Eucalyptol. Terpenes are a large and diverse class of volatile organic compounds, produced by a variety of plants. They often have a strong odor and their function in the plant can be to protect the plant against herbivores or attract pollinators. Because these terpene compounds are "volatile", at ambient temperature they can be released in the air (can evaporate from the plant oils where they are present) and travel with atmospheric conditions. Capone and coworkers showed during a three- year vineyard study that the Eucalyptus taint in wine was not only caused by 1,8-cineole but also that this terpene originated from Eucalyptus trees nearby vineyards (Capone et al., 2012). Eucalyptus oils consist mostly of 1,8-cineole, although depending on the species this can vary from a 60% to 90% contribution. Eucalyptol in wine is described as a medicinal, camphoraceous, fresh/minty/cool character. In high concentrations this is seen as a taint as it overpowers the wine and is not a winegrape varietal characteristic. Another study by Capone (Capone et al., 2011) showed that Eucalyptol can also be present in grape skins and MOG (materials other than grapes such as the stems and leaves). Eucalyptol, or1,8-cineole, is present at significant concentrations in the emissions from some strains of cannabis.
Terpenes have very low aroma detection threshold levels and ETS Laboratories determined that the aroma detection threshold level for California Merlot is I.1 ug/L. Herve et al., (2003) reported a recognition threshold of 3.2 ug/L in red wine. Irrespective, these are detection threshold levels in the parts per billion range.
The first part of the Capone study focused on making wines from grapes from two different vineyards harvested at set distances from the Eucalyptus trees. Their results clearly indicated a large impact due to distance from the terpene source, which in this case is the Eucalyptus trees. Above aroma threshold levels of 1,8-cineole were present in the wines made from grapes up to 50 meters from the Eucalyptus trees. An important fact to remember is that diffusion of volatile compounds depends on several factors including temperature, air pressure and movement. It will diffuse until the environment is in equilibrium. Thus, the distance of travel will depend on initial concentration as well as the listed environmental conditions which will be unique for each site.
In the Capone study, only two sites were utilized, which resulted in different levels of 1,8-cineole in the wines (9.5 - 15.5 .g/L). The study confirmed the airborne transfer of volatile organic compounds as found by other studies (Kennison et al., 2009). The study also showed that even higher concentrations of 1,8-cineole were present in winegrape stems and leaves, potentially due to their larger surface area or difference in exposure to the atmosphere or epidermis (outer layer of tissue in a plant). Thus MOG (material other than grapes, including winegrape stems and leaves) can also be a source of 1,8-cineole. This is particularly concerning due to labor costs and shortage which often necessitates the use of mechanical harvesters where more MOG are included.

Page 162 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 242 of 348

Attachment 11

Capone also found that Eucalyptus leaves and bark can lodge in the grapevines and be included during harvest which made a significant contribution to the 1,8-cineole composition of the wine when included in the must. However, even wines made from hand-picked grapes with no MOG included, including no Eucalyptus leaves and/or bark, produced wines with above aroma threshold levels of 1,8- cincole if made from winegrapes grown within the first 50 meters from Eucalyptus trees. Including grape stems and some grape leaves as will be normal during most fermentations, will result in even higher levels of 1,8-cineole. This study confirmed that terpenes can become airborne and adsorb on to other plant surfaces such as grape berries, leaves and stems. Similar to smoke taint development, continued exposure will result in an increase in 1,8- cineole in the grapes until harvest. Studies have shown that some cannabis strains can contain high levels of 1,8-cineole which may similarly impact winegrape production (Aizpurua-Olaizola et al., 2016). Cannabis produces large amounts of terpenes (as discussed below) and further research is needed to determined if any other cannabis-specific terpenes can adversely affect wine flavor. Additionally, research is needed to determine mitigation steps if needed.
Terpene Drift and Potential Impact Cannabis plants are known for their strong smell due to high concentrations of a range of different terpenes. The chemotype, 1 rowing time, and canopy area effects the concentration of terpenes emitted into the air (mostly monoterpenes, Cio compounds, and sesquiterpenes, Cis compounds). Terpene concentrations in Cannabis plants are in the range of mg/g quantities, whereas the threshold levels of these compounds are in the pg/kg range (Aizpurua-Olaizola et al., 2016). This is a 106 order difference between the cannabis terpene concentration and terpene odor detection levels. Research has shown terpene emission rates of up to 8.7 AgC g' hr' depending on the strain of Cannabis spp (Wang et al., 2019). Additionally, ß-myrcene, eucalyptol and d-limonene were the most dominant terpenes in the emissions for the four strains evaluated. Other important terpenes in cannabis plants are a-pinene, ß-pinene, linalool, a- terpineol, p- caryophyllene, hashishene, a-humulene and more. New terpenes are continually being identified in cannabis plants.
Terpenes are biosynthesized in winegrapes and can play an important role in the varietal character of a winegrape variety. Additionally, during the winemaking process, yeast and bacteria can also synthesize small amounts of terpenes (Carrau et al., 2016). The specific combination of terpenes present in winegrapes depends on the variety, but the total terpene levels will be in the order of wg/kg and ug/l amounts in winegrapes and wines respectively (Waterhouse et al., 2017). Changing the level, relative ratio, and combination of terpenes within winegrapes and thus the resulting wines, could change the character of the wine significantly. Additionally, if one terpene or a combination of terpenes overpowers the wine, making it one- dimensional or imparting unpleasant characters to the wine, the wine may be considered tainted. Furthermore, absorption of terpenes on to the winegrapes will be over the full growth period of the winegrapes, which is several months from pea size to maturity. Thus, a build-up effect is possible within the winegrapes. This means that there may be no specific high terpene odor period needed for potential impact on the winegrape's natural terpene composition.

Page 163 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 243 of 348

Attachment 11

Furthermore, research into the effects of nearby Eucalyptus trees on winegrapes showed absorption by winegrapes at 1 pg/kg to 5 ug/kg levels of Eucalyptol, whereas initial preliminary data on winegrapes show increases of 200 ug/kg to 500 ug/kg of key cannabis terpenes in winegrapes grown close to cannabis plants. This could indicate a much larger impact of cannabis then those determined for Eucalyptus.

Conclusion
Based on the foregoing analysis using the research available to date on the impacts of airborne volatile compounds on winegrapes, outdoor cannabis cultivation, particularly on large scale with large canopy area, could have a potentially significant impact on the terpene composition of winegrapes grown near such cannabis cultivation sites. Changes to the terpene composition of winegrapes has been shown to impact resulting wine quality, In light of the cultural significance and economic impact of the wine industry in California, it is important that care be taken to
avoid adverse impacts while research seeks to provide objective metrics of allowable concentrations and appropriate strains of cannabis grown in proximity to high quality wine
grapes.

I am writing regarding the draft Industrial Hemp Ordinance. My wife, father and I live at 6525 Mira Cielo in Edna Valley and have been unwilling participants in ongoing experiment on the effects of cannibis and industrial hemp in the area. We had no previous exposure to hemp prior to cultivation approximately 2500 feet up the East Corral de Piedra Creek.

I have allergies which have drastically reduced my sense of smell but my wife, like our neighbors, reports the smell makes spending time outside very unpleasant. My 93 year old father, like me, suffers from allergies. At his age, side effects make allergy medications inadvisable. a I fly as a commercial pilot and subject to FAA restrictions. FAA regulations make the more effective antihistamines unusable without a period of 2.5 to 5 days after the last dose. There have been periods when I would be unable to fly due to the allergic reactions or barred from flying due to having to take proscribed antihistamines. I consulted with my allergist about adding hemp to the antigen shots I take and was told that due to Federal research restrictions there was no
test available for hemp allergy and therefore no antigen available. My father's and my increased allergic reactions correlated with my wife's reports of hemp odor.
You don't explain your methodology for determining setbacks which could prevent movement of hemp pollen and odor. The Association of Official Seed Certifying Agencies recommends up to three miles to avoid hemp cross pollenation. We notice the effects of hemp in the air at our house when the air becomes still beginning in the evening, and continuing until the wind begins in the morning. The still air allows the pollen/terpenes to concentrate in the air. As the air cools after sunset it descends, further concentrating the pollen and odorific terpenes. The cooler, denser air then flows down slope. In our case it follows the same path as water down the East Corral de Piedra Creek. A 300 foot setback is a nice, definable number, but has no relationship to the movement of pollen and terpenes and their effects on residents.

The draft ordinance obviously takes hemp odor seriously since it requires that odor not escape from an indoor grow. How is the odor from an outdoor grow any less of an issue?
The draft ordinance is clearly inadequate. The Air Force taught me to never complain about a problem without proposing a solution. Proper prediction of the flow of air containing pollen and terpenes requires expensive and time consuming measurement and modeling. It appears the only reliable way to ensure the effects of hemp cultivation do not make existing residences subject to the problems we now face. If that is not cost effective for growers, the three mile cross pollenation distance measured by the Association of Official Seed Certifying Agencies should apply.

Dear Board of Supervisors, Kip Morais and Brian Pedrotti,

I am writing you today with regard to the San Luis Obispo County's proposed Industrial Hemp Ordinance drafted by county staff members for your consideration. I would like to specifically address my concerns as a business professional running a business in Edna Valley and the negative impacts we've experience from a hemp growing operation that exists less than a mile down the road from our business, located at 300 Green Gate Road in San Luis Obispo.

- have been directly involved with the restoration and development of Greengate Ranch & Vineyard, located in Edna Valley from when it was first acquired by it's new ownership in 2012. Since that time, we worked tirelessly to restore the property and we are now running a very successful Events & Wedding Venue, home rental business and we farm a 90+ acre vineyard. Currently, we host 20- a 25 weddings a year with an average guest list of approximately 200 ppl in attendance and during our off season, we have 4 rental homes all of which have few vacancies. Our business operations bring approximately 4- 5,000 travelers a year from all over the country and Edna Valley is now nationally recognized as a top location for destination weddings . We currently employ 6 full-time employees and by many standards are considered a small employer to our county's workforce. That said, each year we refer business to over a 50+ various local vendors
from the events and wedding industry. These vendors include: Event planners,
photographers, caterers, beverage service providers, wineries,
florists, lighting/draperies installers, furnishings, linens & service wear rental companies, musicians and DJs. In addition to our vendor referrals, those attending guests also require accommodations, dining experiences and enjoy the very best of SLO County's wine country. I share these business statistics not to boast of our successes, but rather to impress on you how impactful our business is not only to our local business community, but also in boosting tourism and creating lasting impressions with thousands of people every year.
For those reasons, I urge I you once again to consider our concerns with the Industrial Hemp Ordinance as drafted and specifically with regard to the cultivation set-backs. The proposed draft does not recognize or sufficiently address potential health concerns and/or safety of any resident, proximity to schools, impacts on businesses, their employees or the air quality due to cultivation and harvesting of Hemp. Our business co-exists on a shared road with a neighboring hemp grower and the simple facts prove a 300 ft set-back does not provide adequate distance to diffuse the smell as we are less
than a mile distance away. On several occasions the odor has been so strong it

1 Page 166 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 246 of 348

Attachment 11

permeates throughout our property & into the homes and our guests have left with a negative experience. This coupled with the potential of multiple grow cycles to push yields, gives us little reprieve from the odors that linger far beyond the initial harvest. Therefore, it is our conclusion that running a business within close proximity to hemp production is harmful to our business, our benefactors, i.e., the vendors we work with as well as the local businesses outside our referral group.
In closing, given the on-going revisions occurring at the State and Federal level, it may prove wise to observe the progression as the regulations evolve and allow time for
further research on all the impacts of the Industrial Hemp production. In the meantime, should you move forward with some version of the ordinance, we respectfully ask that you reconsider the proposed set-backs requirements and increase distance far beyond a mere 300 ft. from any business, residences (to include those zone rural residential), schools/parks and any business bringing consumers to the area.
Thank you very much for your thoughtful consideration and I would like to express our sincere appreciation to the Board of Supervisors, county staff and all those working hard to ensure the safety and well being of our community and our local businesses.

Most sincerely,

Comments on Ordnance:

Before addressing the specifics of the ordnance a comment on my experience. I have sent notes to the supervisors before regarding the smell from the hemp. Many times when I go outdoors I have an overpowering smell that makes
my eyes water.

Generally the ordnance does not address the concerns of the citizens, particularly of Edna Valley.

Nuisance Odors: this term is not defined leaving each situation up to interpretation from different parties. In addition it appears it is only addressed for indoor growth and processing, what about the nuisance odor from outdoor growth. In addition odors are present even when the crop is not in bloom.
Setback: A setback of 300 feet is meaningless. I am not sure how far the hemp is from my property at this point but l clearly have a nuisance odor. I would think that a mile setback would possibly mitigate the odor but am not an expert on scent traveling in the air, however 300 feet clearly does not mitigate the impact.
Residences in ag zones: It is not acceptable to have no setback for residences in agriculture zoned areas. While hemp may currently be categorized as an agriculture crop is it quite different from what is currently grown in the Edna Valley. It clearly has nuisance odor and no one is yet sure of its potential impact on other crops. A significant setback is needed for residences.

Thank you for the opportunity to comment. I would be happy to provide any further comment or participate in
discussion.

Sincerely,

Lynda Ziegler

DATE: January 21, 2020
TO: Planning Commission
FROM: Kip Morais, Project Manager

SUBJECT: Industrial Hemp Ordinance (LRP2019-00008) - Industrial Hemp Processing

Staff would like to highlight the proposed Industrial Hemp Processing Standards for discussion. The Public Hearing Draft (PHD) ordinance currently defines industrial hemp
processing as the following:

5. Industrial Hemp Processing. For the purposes of this section the
processing of Industrial hemp is limited solely to drying, curing,
trimming, packaging and preparing for further processing within a
permanent building (not a hoop house or similar non-permanent
structure). The drying, curing, trimming, packaging and preparing for
further processing of industrial hemp grown onsite that is performed
in the field with mobile equipment not involving permanent buildings
are included under Crop Production and Grazing and subject to the
standards set forth under 22.30.244. Industrial hemp processing does
not include cannabinoid extraction and infusion and manufacturing of
finished products. Finished hemp products are classified under
existing Industry, Manufacturing, and Processing uses according to
their end product and scale of operations. For example, manufacturing
of CBD infused chemical products would be considered Chemical
Manufacturing, hemp cloth manufacturing would be classified as
textile manufacturing etc.

The drying, curing, trimming, packaging and preparing for further processing within a permanent building is considered an Agricultural Processing use. However, the PHD ordinance makes a distinction for processing industrial hemp grown onsite performed in the field with mobile equipment not involving permanent buildings. The ordinance classifies these activities as crop production and grazing.

This distinction was made in the PHD in an effort to be consistent with the Definition for Ag Processing found in the definition sections of Title 22 (Land Use Ordinance) and the Coastal
Zone Framework for Planning that specifically states that processing performed in the field with mobile equipment not involving permanent buildings is included under crop production and grazing, as follows:

Ag Processing (land use). Establishments performing a variety of operations on crops after harvest, to prepare them for market on-site or further processing and packaging at a
distance from the agricultural area including but not limited to: alfalfa cubing; hay baling and cubing; corn shelling; drying of corn, rice, hay, fruits and vegetables; precooling and packaging of fresh or farm-dried fruits and vegetables; grain cleaning and custom grinding; custom grist mills; custom milling of flour, feed and grain; sorting, grading and packing of fruits and vegetables, tree nut hulling and shelling; cotton ginning; wineries, production of olive oil without the use of solvents, alcohol fuel production; and receiving and processing of green material, other than that produced on-site (commercial composting). Green material is any wastes which are derived from plant material, including but not limited to, leaves, grass clippings, weeds, tree trimmings or shrubbery cuttings. Note: any of the above activities performed in the field with mobile equipment not involving permanent buildings (with the exception of the receiving and processing of green material other than that produced on- site) are included under "Crop Production and Grazing."(emphasis added) Olive oil produced with the use of solvents is included under "Food and Beverage Products". (SIC: 0723, 0724) [Amended 1995, Ord. 2740; 2012, Ord. 3235]

Furthermore, the definition for crop production includes #9: Field Processing:
Field Processing. Mechanical processing of crops in the field at harvest, when such activities do not involve a permanent structure. Such activities include but are not limited to hay baling and field-crushing of grapes

Two issues were raised that may warrant further clarification in the PDH Industrial Hemp section as written. In discussions with the County Counsel and the Building Division it became apparent that any processing (including drying and curing) performed in a hoop house would create a change of occupancy per Title 19 and would therefore not be allowed in such a non-permitted structure. The second issue that merits discussion is the process of field drying. This practice does have the potential to produce odors and would lengthen the amount of time odors are present on-site possibly by several weeks. To address these two items, one possible revision would be as follows:

Industrial Hemp Processing. For the purposes of this section the processing of Industrial hemp is limited solely to drying, curing, trimming, packaging and preparing for further processing within a permanent building (not a hoop house or similar non-permanent structure). The drying, curing, trimming, packaging and preparing for further processing ef
The harvesting of industrial hemp grown onsite that is performed in the field with mobile
equipment not involving permanent buildings, hoop houses, or trailers are is included under
Crop Production and Grazing and subject to the standards set forth under 22.30.244.

This possible revision language would eliminate field drying and curing of industrial hemp and clarify up front that the use of hoop houses and trailers is not appropriate for industrial hemp processing either as an Agricultural Processing Use nor under Crop Production and
Grazing. Staff is requesting that the Planning Commission discuss the issue and provide feedback to staff.

RE: Comments for Draft Hemp Ordinance
TO: Kip Morais, Project Manager
Brian Pedrotti, Senior Planner
FROM: Susan Huls, Nipomo Resident

The Hemp Ordinance is an opportunity to "get it right" after the debacle of the cannabis
ordinance. Compatible land use needs to be the driving premise in the development of the ordinance in order to protect the $2.54 billion traditional agriculture industry in San Luis Obispo
county.

After attending the ALAB hemp sub-committee meetings and conducting research on the cultivation of hemp, I offer the following comments and assertions for consideration for inclusion
in the final hemp ordinance:

The similarities of cannabis and hemp, they are basically the same plant, and the issues
associated with both - odor, appearance, water usage, potential for cross pollination with the increase/reduction of THC content, requires careful consideration for the successful cultivation, compatibility with traditional agriculture and surrounding residents. The hemp ordinance must protect a thriving and valuable wine industry especially with the shift in tourism from the Sonoma/Napa to SLO (Paso, Edna Valley, etc.) due to the wildfires.Nat Geo.com, Los Angeles Times Oct. 27,2019, Fortune Nov. 6, 2019
There iS not enough data on the effect of cannabis/hemp terpenes on wine grapes as the research is in progress with several years before the results are known. (See letter
from UC Davis) Therefore setbacks need to be most restrictive until research data
proves otherwise.
The pesticide drift issue is threatening traditional ag with lawsuits by the hemp/cannabis for liability, pesticide contractors refusal to apply required pesticides, has become a major concern of the Santa Barbara/SLO County Shippers and Growers Association. Sensitive receptors: MUST include single/multi family residences as well as locations including wineries, event venues, concert venues, etc.
No-grow zones of a 3 mile radius to address the cross pollination issue such as
implemented in Monterey County.
Must include restrictions/mitigations for 24 lighting of indoor cultivations such as those established in the cannabis ordinance for consistency.
Must include restrictions for noise resulting from fans used with indoor cultivations such
as those established the cannabis ordinance for consistency. Minimum decibel levels as
well time of day/night restrictions of operation.
Signage: (from the San Joaquin Co. ordinance) (Hopefully to prevent theft and
vandalism from those mistaking hemp for cannabis)
i. Be of size so that the wording on the sign is clearly visible and readable to a person with normal vision from a distance of twenty-five (25) feet; and

Page 172 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 252 of 348

Attachment 11

ii. Use letters and symbols that are of a color that sharply contrasts with their Immediate background; and
iii. Be posted at the corners of the parcel and at all usual points of entry to the parcel, including each road, footpath, walkway, or aisle that enters the cultivation area.
When a parcel is adjacent to a public right-of-way, such as a road, trail, path, signs a Shall be posted at intervals not exceeding 600 feet along the parcel's border with the right-of-way.
Odor mitigation must be consistent with cannabis ordinance for indoor/greenhouse cultivation. Odor mitigation methods used must address the odor before it leaves the
greenhouse. No nuisance odors are to be detected outside the building.
Minimum parcel size (acres): Outdoor cultivations - 30 acres
Indoor cultivation - 20 acres

• Zoning: No hemp cultivation in rural residential zones
Outdoor cultivation in general agricultural zones only Manufacturing and process in commercial/industrial zones only All setbacks must be from the property line for consistency with the hemp and cannabis
ordinance.

Hemp maybe classified as an agricultural crop, BUT the reality is it possesses unique characteristics that differentiates it from a traditional ag crop. Therefore hemp requires a thoughtful, fact based ordinance to ensure compatibility with current land use and the valuable, existing agricultural industry in the county.

Respectfully,
Susan Huls

RE: Comments on the County Draft Hemp Ordinance

On Tuesday, June 18, 2019, the San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors passed an Urgency Ordinance placing temporary moratorium on the cultivation of industrial hemp. On July 16, 2019, the Board extended that urgency ordinance through June 2020. At that same meeting, the Board directed the County Planning Department, with input and assistance from the Agricultural Liaison Advisory Board (ALAB) hemp industry representatives, and concerned citizens, to develop a permanent ordinance
governing hemp cultivation.

On December 18, 2019, ALAB sent a letter to the County making five recommendations, which were generally supportive of hemp cultivation, but clearly lacking in any definitive policy recommendations.
The strongest recommendation made by ALAB states:

"ALAB strongly recommends that as new research on the potential impacts of hemp cultivation (and processing) becomes available that this new scientific information is examined in the
context of any permanent hemp ordinance that is enacted by the county. ALAB recommends that this review occur annually, and the permanent hemp ordinance be amended to reflect new research information and associated impacts, if necessary and/or warranted."
This comment clearly reflects the concerns expressed by ALAB members, and "concerned citizens" who attended the policy meetings, that there simply is not enough reliable or scientific information to access the environmental and human health impacts of hemp cultivation.
The San Luis Obispo County Farm Bureau in their comment letter to the County, dated December 19, 2019, regarding the hemp ordinance states:

"Our members have identified three primary issues of concern with industrial hemp, including: Odors from hemp cultivation being a nuisance to neighboring residences or businesses; Possible contamination of wine grapes by compounds present in the odor emitted by hemp and cannabis (compounds known as terpenes); and
Legal liability from contaminating hemp and cannabis with pesticides used in neighboring crop fields for non-hemp or cannabis crops."

The issues raised by ALAB and the Farm Bureau reflect the agricultural and farming community's concerns about the environmental impacts caused by the cultivation of hemp.

Further, the County's Urgency Ordinance #3393, which declared a moratorium on hemp cultivation, the County states in Sec 2 (N):

"As cannabis cultivation permits have been processed, the County has received substantial amounts of public testimony regarding the potential harmful effects of cultivating cannabis,

Page 174 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 254 of 348

Attachment 11

specifically, odor nuisance and public safety concerns. Individuals opposing either existing or proposed cannabis cultivations, cite foul "skunk-like" smells emanating from the operation, the need to close windows, people unable to go outside due to the noxious skunklike odor, and people experiencing irritated eyes because of the odor. Cannabis cultivation projects are therefore individually reviewed to look at setbacks and locations of sensitive receptors in order to minimize odor nuisance. Individuals also cite similar odor complaints regarding certain odor "masking" systems which are often used in the growing of cannabis identifying an "overwhelming Febreze like smell" which is similarly annoying and causing eye irritation. At this point, it is unclear if industrial hemp has similar odors thus implicating these same potential
impacts and further study and analysis is needed in order to assess those potential risks to the
public health, safety and welfare and impose any reasonable regulations which may be needed.
It is not clear that the County has conducted the appropriate studies to determine the potential risks to the environment and human health raised by ALAB, the Farm Bureau, and your own Ordinance (#3393, Sec 2(N). I trust that the County will conduct an appropriate environmental review of this draft ordinance prior to any administrative vote.

Thank you for the consideration.

Supervisors:

This letter is in response to your Hemp Ordinance dated November 19, 2019:

Your mission statement published on your website states that your goal is the "implementation of policies and provision of services that will enhance the economic, environmental, and social quality of life in San Luis Obispo County." Sadly, your hemp ordinance does not meet any of those goals.

1. The biggest problem with your ordinance is that there is no provision for an enforcement division and there are no specific consequences to enforce. A "cannabis hearing officer" is mentioned, but there is no such office currently active, funded, or defined. If this job falls under the jurisdiction of a board or office already established, how is it funded and provided for? Do we have equipment to test crops? Do we have exact consequences for crops that do not meet testing levels? Basically-who goes out into the field to find violations and has the power and resources to correct them? What exactly are the violations? An active, working enforcement division must be in place before permits are granted and growers can operate. Growers cannot stay within a standard that is not clearly stated with consequences established for violation. Until the infrastructure is established and an enforcement body implemented, hemp/cannabis growers have nothing to be accountable for.

2. What constitutes "nuisance?" is there a measure of terpene levels in the air or distance of travel through the air that can be measured? Residents of Edna Valley have learned that the molecular structure of cannabis terpenes causes them to "sink" in the atmosphere and our unique environmental structure allows the odor and allergens, to travel air streams to the lowest place. Simply put, you could be right next to a hemp a field, but slightly elevated and not smell it at all, but depending on wind currents, you

Page 176 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 256 of 348

Attachment 11

could be over a mile away and with a shift in current be blinded by sneezing, watery eyes, and breathing difficulty. How are your set-backs determined? Distance is meaningless in the Edna Valley's unusual environment. Odor is a part of agriculture, but intense allergens is not.

3. Due to its unique weather and environmental conditions, one solution might be to "carve out" the Edna Valley as a cannabis free area until conflicts with established crops
can be identified. If the conflicts with established crop can be managed, then that needs to be set in place. If conflicts remain detrimental to existing operations, then locations of hemp/cannabis operations will need to be restricted. The reason that the Edna Valley has been established as a perfect place for certain varieties of grapes, citrus, and vegetable crops is its unique characteristics. Cannabis is known to interfere with some of these established crops and some of the methods of farming, materials used in growing, and timing for applications of amendments to established crops and cannabis crops are in currently conflict.

4. The state of California CFDA new rules now include the addition of the word "all" in
their regulations regarding cannabis and hemp. The latest state documents say "all hemp cultivation", "all cannabis operations" instead of leaving cannabis and hemp operations with multiple and confusing designations that lead to unregulated operations. Anyone or any group, organization, or institution who cultivates, grows, or transplants hemp/cannabis is included in regulations. We have had a serious problem with unregulated spraying, threats to established farmers, drift to bordering crops, lack of protection to farm workers, use of unidentified amendments, and claims of organic crops that do not meet organic requirements in the Edna Valley. There are some issues that come up because hemp/cannabis cultivation is new to our county. Just because something has been overlooked in regulations, it should not become an "unregulated" is use or entity that is outside regulation. Use of the word "all" and addressing known current types of licenses and permits would help alleviate the "Wild West" conditions we met with this year.

If all hemp and cannabis operations meet the same requirements as other farmed crops for testing, spraying, contamination of neighboring properties, creek setbacks, CA Water Board reporting and testing, run-off regulations, the enforcement of standards would be much simpler. If these are truly agricultural crops, they should be required to meet all farming regulations regardless if they grow for industrial, medical, research, or personal
use.

5. Why are rural residential structure not included in setbacks and protections? Just because someone farms vegetables and has a home on their farm does not mean they do not need protection and consideration. If something is dangerous for school children,

Page 177 of 259 Exhibit H Page 257 of 348

Attachment 11

wine tasters, and wedding guests-it is dangerous to residents who are there every day. Please include Rural Residential structures in your document.

In conclusion, these are only a few of the many problems with the currently proposed Hemp Ordinance. When the State declared hemp and cannabis to be legally grown in California, it gave counties the responsibility to regulate the crops. That was huge responsibility for counties and has resulted in terrific problems where a structure is not in place. San Luis Obispo County needs specific rules and protections for both the hemp/cannabis growers and the established business/residents/farmers that are already here. Without rules, consequences, and enforcement no one is protected. This document has nothing but a vague outline. It does not address the concerns and complaints that have arisen this last year as we tried to move forward without structure. Law enforcement cannot enforce rules that do not exist. Loopholes allow farmers to operate in unsafe manners. It is not the job of the Board to be everyone's it friend, it is the job of the Board to create and implement policies that are best for the whole county. Please create a document that has specific rules and consequences for the cannabis/hemp growers so that we can all work together like we did when the new wine, citrus, and avocado growers came into our area and when we moved from cattle barons to include hay, vegetables, and growing crops. Please be sure that there is a funded, active, established agency that has the power and staffing to deal with issues that arise. Please include all growers in your documents.
There should be a way to have hemp/cannabis as part of our San Luis Obispo agricultural plan. Whether it means carving out sensitive areas, increasing setbacks, or something else, we cannot go on with the reckless abandon that has occurred in 2018 and 2019. Most hemp/cannabis growers want to fit into the community without being a nuisance. Most established farmers are open to bringing in new crops to enhance and strengthen our agricultural community. We can't work together if we do not know what
we are and are not allowed to do and what things we may need to adjust to make it all
happen.

Thank you for your diligence in making this document an enforceable, effective plan for
our county.

Hello,

I was one of the applicants that was rejected in SLO county when the ordinance last year. Since then, we have moved our business elsewhere where we are cultivating indoors
If SLO opens back up, we would certainly like to move our business back here. However, 5 acres of indoor cultivation is too large of a permit requirement.

Why?
Because indoor growers do not grow large scale hemp biomass. It would not make any sense, given how much more expensive it is to grow indoors. It only makes sense to grow indoors when you are trying to grow high quality hemp flowers, which require controlled conditions.

And to have a company selling flower products, you just don't need very much acreage.
My company sells tens of thousands of 1 gram units wholesale monthly, and we only require .25 acres of grow operation to supply that business.

Plus, you will almost never be able to smell indoor grows, or see them. Unless they are massive.
I'd invite you down to my current grow operation in Santa Maria if you would like to get a feel for the smell and see what .25 acres of indoor looks like.

To summarize: even a strong and relatively large indoor grow company will rarely ever use 5+ acres of indoor grow space, due to costs and the product you tend to develop indoors. We should remove the size limit or decrease it
significantly to accommodate these companies.

You also cut off the author of Page 48 (from mi@ggslo.com) and Page 57 (from Dr. Brad Parkinson). Then you have some floating pages, #70, #71, #72, and #73 that are not connected to any letter.
I ask that you please correct the attachment to include ALL pages of the comment letters you received, and please notify all of the Commissioners of your error. Not including some of the Public Comment could be inferred as bias, and should cause the Commissioners to pause and do some soul searching as to the question if they are getting all the story.

Mr. Moras and Mr. Pedrotti:

In the near future, you will be asking the Planning Commission to amend it's ordinances as they pertain to the growing of hemp in San Luis Obispo County. I have issues with what has been presented, primarily with what has happened recently and how your proposed ordinance changes would address and resolve the issues.
We are residents of the County for 38 years. For the past 20 years we have owned a parcel on the southern border of the Edna Valley next to the Cold Canyon Landfill, and lived on it for it 15 years as residents.
After being out of the a area for a few weeks this last September, we returned the first of October. On October 2nd, my wife smelled hemp/cannabis odors for about 1 hour that were coming from the primary grower in the middle of the Edna Valley. We are 5,800 feet from the hemp/cannabis grow site and 6,300 feet from the
1 Page 180 of 259 Exhibit H - Page 260 of 348

Attachment 11

hemp growing site. For purposes of this letter, I will use the 5,800 foot distance as the distance to the odor site. I sent a complaint to the County, the Board of Supervisors, the individual Board members, the APCD, the AG Commissioner's office, and the Planning Department.
The only response was from the APCD, who said that since the CA Department of Food and Agriculture has
identified cannabis (which includes hemp) as an agricultural product, that have no jurisdiction as agricultural crops are specifically exempted from APCD regulation dealing with nuisance odors.
There was no response from the AG Commissioner's office.
On October 4th, I smelled the hemp/cannabis again, this time for an extended period of about 4 hours. It was smelled by four other people. It was at a higher elevation than the first complaint. I did not report it, because the first nuisance complaint was pending for a County response. That response was never received.

I cite this experience, because it should cause the staff and the decision makers to pause and ask the question, "How does the proposed ordinance address this type of complaint? Would it have been dealt with and resolved?"

Contrary to the comment by one Board member questioning the possibility that these odors could travel over a mile, the odors did travel over a mile. In the case of the first complaint, 5,800 feet. This was at the floor of the Valley, which is about 40 feet above the elevation of the hemp grow site. For the second complaint, it was smelled at an elevation of 420', 120' above the elevation of the grow sites.
1. Enforcement. Clearly, right now there is no enforcement. Unless something changes, the status quo will remain. No enforcement. Parts of new enforcement issues are just now being developed at the State and Federal levels, dealing with testing protocals, time of testing, etc. Counties are rethinking their Ordinances. Initial rushes to adopt have been shown to be fraught with errors, as evidenced by Buellton, Carpinteria, and the rest of Santa Barbara County's issues, Oregon school issues, Monterey County's almost complete banning of the products except in remote areas, Napa Valley issues, even former Lieutenant
Governor' Maldonado's SLO testing protocal issues to name a few.

2. Nuisance Odors- Processing. Section 22.30.070.D.5.b states:

"Nuisance Odors. All Industrial hemp processing facilities shall be sited and/or operated in a manner that prevents hemp nuisance odors from being detected offsite. An odor management plan shall be submitted with the use permit application that demonstrates how nuisance odor will be controlled to be undetectable offsite."

Since I have detected nuisance odors, reported them, and I am 5,800 feet away, that means no industrial hemp processing facilities can be sited where they are today. It had to be hemp, because if it were cannabis, under 22.74.150.G, the AG Department would be going through the Nuisance Abatement Hearings. I have
heard nothing on this potential action.

If the grower was doing processing, what have they (the Ag Department) done to the growing site's Odor Management Plan to make odors undetectable at my home (as it's the offsite location)? If nothing, the Ordinance needs some tweaking.

3. Nuisance Odors- Cultivation- Outdoors. Section 22/30.244.B.2 (Hemp Cultivation) states an odor control requirement for indoor growing, but is mute on outdoor growing. You now have a complaint from 1-1/4 miles away on an outdoor grow, so what will the control requirement be for outdoor grows? The setback of 300 feet clearly will not work for control, as it has been "busted".
With this omission, the County staff is condemning every citizen and business living, operating or being within 5,800 feet of a hemp site of having to put up with these odors. That is a very big radius, and the smell is not
pleasant.

Attachment 11

Proponents of growing cannabis and/or hemp try to point out that odoriferous vegetables like broccoli, are allowed to grow under Right to Farm Ordinances. However, those other products have been grown for decades here, most likely longer than the County Planning Ordinances even existed. a Hemp is a new product.
The AG Ordinance that protects older crops states:

Section 5.16.031. Pre-existing Agricultural Processing Uses Not a Nuisance
(2) If an agricultural processing activity, operation, facility, or appurtenances thereof substantially increased its activities or operations after January 1, 1993, then a public or private nuisance action may be brought with respect to those increases in activities or operations that have a significant effect on the environment. For increases in activities or operations that have been in effect more than three years, there is a rebuttable presumption affecting the burden of producing evidence that the increase was not substantial

Hemp does not meet this standard. It is not pre-existing. A public or private nuisance action may be brought.
If broccoli were introduced today, it most likely would not be approved, or as Monterey County did with hemp, approved but isolated to an unpopulated area.
I believe the best way to deal with this issue would be to increase the setback to a greater distance, reflective of the complaints received to date across the State. The 300 foot distance is not based on science, statistics, or real world data. If| am wrong, please provide the hard backup data showing 300' is a statistically significant answer. would like to offer setting the setback to 2,640 feet (1/2 mile), as believe the County would eliminate in one fell swoop maybe 70% of the potential complaints.
Then in five years, revisit the ordinance to see what complaints were received, and statistically set the setback distance to protect a certain percentage of the population based on distance. Maybe use the figure that would eliminate 80% of the individual locations complaining of odors.
4. Facilities included in Setback Limits (22.30.244.B.1.a). Permitted Event Centers should be added as an operation to be avoided. "Permitted" because those operations have gone through County review and should be protected.

5. Setbacks for Indoor Hemp Cultivation (22.30.244.B.1.b). 100 feet for a setback is not enough. All the "indoor" part does (the roof and walls) is concentrate and intensify the odors so that when they are released, they are concentrated more than an open outdoor grow that just continually emits the same amount but over a longer time. I suggest that a distance that is 50% of the outdoor setback be used.
hope that you take these comments under consideration. Thank you very much.

Brian how have you been ? l just received an e-mail about the Hemp meeting tomorrow and hopefully it's not to late to register my comments. After ten years of dealing with Plant Source /Viva Farms at this location my neighbors and I have now spent the last ten months putting up with this extremely annoying operation . There are still four non permitted buildings at this location that are part of a demolition permit issued in 2016. The new
owners are not only continuing to use them but have installed lights and fifteen huge very loud fans that come on automatically 24 hours a day. The hemp odor generated at this location can be smelled by neighbors as far away as the old Clearwater Nursery on Mesa Road,you can imagine how strong it is at my house just 90 to 100 feet away! I don't know how much time you spent on Granny-Tiny home ordinances but at a SCAC meeting
you stated motor homes and travel trailers were not allowed as living
quarters but when the employee that is living on the property was
presented to Danny DelRio at Code Enforcement he said it was irrelevant. Hopefully my and the other neighbors concerns will be considered and this Hemp Grow can be required to relocate. Thanks Mike Berry

My name is Donna Mehlschau and I have lived in
Nipomo since 1959.

Our valley area supports various Agricultural crops.
Avocado, citrus, wine grapes, row crops, and nurseries are some of the commodities. All ag crops are governed
by the California Department of Food and Agriculture
and monitored for various reasons. None of the existing
crops however has 24 pages devoted to regulations as
does the HEMP.

HEMP is NOT JUST ANOTHER AG CROP.

If you approve Hemp as an AG crop then you must
evaluate the compatability with existing crops. Is Hemp
and Cannabis going to be able to exist side by side????

U.C. Coop. Extension, Farm Advisor
Mark Battany ALAB recommends that County Planning strive to develop this ordinance,
and its associated requirements and restrictions, in a manner that minimizes
conflicts with existing agricultural operations and businesses.
ALAB recommends that County Planning consider the implementation of a
sliding scale for setback requirements based upon the number of industrial hemp acres being cultivated.
Although ALAB could not come to consensus on exactly what those setback distances should be, it was it agreed
that it is logical to require smaller setback distances from smaller sized growing sites, relative to the acreage of
the hemp growing site.

Page 1 of 6 Exhibit H - Page 340 of 348

Attachment 12

In Section 22.30.244 (B.)1.c: ALAB recommends that riparian and wetland setbacks be struck from the ordinance
due to this requirement being duplicative of existing requirements from other agencies that growers must
already meet.
ALAB recommends that direction is given to the Agricultural Commissioner's Office to develop a set of
recommended and/or required Best Management Practices (BMP's) for the cultivation of industrial hemp
locally. Once these BMP's are developed, ALAB recommends that consideration is given toward incorporating
those BMP's into the industrial hemp registration process conducted by the Agricultural Commissioner's Office.
ALAB strongly recommends that as new research on the potential impacts of hemp cultivation (and processing)
becomes available that this new scientific information is examined in the context of any permanent hemp
ordinance that is enacted by the county. ALAB recommends that this review occur annually, and the permanent
hemp ordinance be amended to reflect new research information and associated impacts, if necessary and/or
warranted.

Thank you for your consideration of these recommendations.

Sincerely, pe Jean-Pierre Wolff, Ph.D.

ALAB Meeting - December 9, 2019
Review of the ALAB Subcommittee's actions regarding the Development of a Permanent Ordinance for
Industrial Hemp Cultivation in San Luis Obispo County - updated to reflect the second set of meetings
occurring from October - December 2019.
I. BACKGROUND: The ALAB Subcommittee on hemp met three times in August 2019, and then passed
their recommendations and areas of consensus along to the entire ALAB group at the September ALAB
meeting. At that September ALAB meeting, it was recommended that the hemp subcommittee continue
meeting to see if there were any other areas of consensus that could be reached, recognizing that the
hemp subcommittee meetings would be a parallel process going on while County Planning worked on
developing: draft permanent ordinance.
SUBCOMMITTEE MEETING DATES: October 9, 2019; November 6, 2019; December 4, 2019

II. SUBCOMMITTEE RESULTS:

The hemp subcommittee could not reach any areas of consensus on any of the outstanding
major issues, such as setback distances or the exact definition of sensitive receptor.
The subcommittee did discuss the possibility of using a sliding scale for setbacks based on the
size of the proposed hemp cultivation site. Although consensus could not be agreed upon
regarding the exact setback distance, it was generally agreed that having setbacks vary
depending on the size of cultivation was a good idea, but that it may be difficult to address
within an ordinance framework.

III. COMMENTS ON PUBLIC DRAFT OF PERMANENT HEMP ORDINANCE: County Planning released the
Public Draft version of the permanent hemp ordinance on November 19, 2019. The ALAB hemp
subcommittee met once after the release of the public draft.

The subcommittee agreed that the environmental/riparian setback should be struck from the
ordinance as redundant to other requirements that growers must meet.
The subcommittee agreed in principle that the ordinance should be established in a manner that
minimizes conflicts with existing agricultural operations and businesses.
The subcommittee agreed in principle that as new research on the potential impacts of hemp
cultivation (and processing) becomes available that the ordinance should be reviewed within the
context of this newly available information, and amended as necessary.

ALAB Meeting - September 9, 2019

Review of the ALAB Subcommittee's actions regarding the Development of a Permanent Ordinance for
Industrial Hemp Cultivation in San Luis Obispo County

I. BACKGROUND:

On June 18, 2019, the San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors enacted an urgency
ordinance placing a temporary moratorium on industrial hemp cultivation (with a few
exemptions).
On July 2, 2019, ALAB submitted a letter to the Board of Supervisors with concerns about the
land use regulations imposed on industrial hemp production, emphasizing that hemp should not
have land use restrictions different from other legal crops.
http://www.slocounty.ca.gov/Departments/Agriculture-Weights-and-Measures/All-Forms-Documents/Information/Meeting-
Minutes/ALAB-Meeting-Agendas,-Minutes,-Presentations/2019/ALAB 2019_ 07_01-Draft-Mins-plus-Hemp-Letter.aspx
On July 16, 2019, the Board of Supervisors voted to extend that same urgency ordinance
in through June 2020. At that same meeting in July, the Board also directed County Planning to
develop a permanent ordinance that would allow industrial hemp cultivation within the county
with certain restrictions, such as zoning limitations, minimum parcel sizes, and possible
setbacks. The Board asked County Planning to prepare a potential permanent ordinance and
return sometime in early 2020, with the intention that a permanent ordinance would be
enacted by spring 2019 and supersede (e.g. replace) the urgency ordinance. The Board directed
County Planning to work with the Agricultural Liaison Advisory Board (ALAB) through an ALAB
subcommittee, the County Ag Department, hemp growers, and concerned citizens to develop
the permanent ordinance.
At the August 5, 2019 ALAB meeting, a subcommittee was established to work with County
Planning on a draft permanent ordinance to regulate hemp cultivation.

hemp industry
SUBCOMMITTEE MEETING DATES: August 13, 2019; August 20, 2019; August 26, 2019

III. SUBCOMMITTEE GOALS

Subcommittee Chair Dan Rodrigues emphasized that all input should be respectful and civil with
the overarching goal of finding areas of consensus. Dan reminded the subcommittee members

Page 4 of 6 Exhibit H - Page 343 of 348

Attachment 12

that the focus should be on addressing those items specifically identified by the Board of
Supervisors: zoning requirements, setbacks, and minimum parcel sizes.
Dan explained that the entire ordinance would get reviewed at future hearings at ALAB
meetings, the Planning Commission, and the Board of Supervisors. Anything recommended
could get changed several times prior to any permanent ordinance getting enacted so it makes sense to identify those areas where we can find common ground and not get bogged down in
the discussion of very specific details.
Dan also explained that any subcommittee recommendations that are agreed upon does not
necessarily need to be the direction of the ALAB board itself. The full ALAB membership may
come to different conclusions than the subcommittee.

IV. SUBCOMMITTEE - AREAS OF CONSENSUS

ZONING LIMITATIONS:

Agriculture (AG) and Rural Lands (RL) zoned parcels: Hemp cultivation, both indoor and outdoor,
should.be allowed on these properties.
On lands zoned Rural Residential (RR), cultivation of transplants should be allowed. Since
transplants will be defined as only non-flowering plants, this cultivation should be allowed both
indoors and outdoors. It's recognized that transplant growing will typically be done indoors in
greenhouses on RR zoned properties, but they may need to move them outside to harden them
iS off prior to shipping and there is no reason to disallow that ability.
On lands zoned Rural Residential (RR), Industrial (Ind), and Commercial Services (CS), growers
would have the option of going through the discretionary use permit process (Minor Use Permit)
to grow full flowering plants. It was recognized that this isn't an ideal scenario, but due to
concerns with trying to tackle this issue in the permanent ordinance and the detail needed to
determine if a grower has an adequate closed system type greenhouse needed to alleviate odor
issues, and the goal of staying on track with an expedited timeline, this was a mechanism of at
least leaving the door open to those who wanted to grow indoor hemp on parcels zoned RR,
IND, or CS.

SETBACKS or BUFFERS:

The group agreed that any setbacks that may be established should be measured from a particular identified use off-site from the hemp grower's parcel and not from the hemp grower's
property line. In other words, there is no need for setbacks from grower's property line if the
hemp cultivation is taking place well away from any potential conflicts.
The group agreed that any setbacks or buffers that may be established should be measured
from a "sensitive site" or "sensitive receptor". There was not an agreement established on
exactly what those sensitive receptors should be. Items discussed included schools and state
licensed daycares, residential zoned areas or properties (as opposed to a single residence or a
couple of residences located on agricultural zoned lands), existing agricultural
crops/commodities, wineries, and winery tasting rooms.

MINIMUM PARCEL SIZES:

Page 5 of 6 Exhibit H - Page 344 of 348

Attachment 12

The group agreed that minimum parcel size was not required. It was discussed that any
setbacks or buffers developed would be geared toward alleviating land use conflict between
neighbors, and would be more effective than a minimum parcel size (e.g, if there was a
minimum parcel size but no setback/buffer established than the grower could still plant in a
corner of his property close directly adjacent to other residences or established crops and a
required minimum parcel size would be ineffective). In addition, by not allowing full flowering
hemp plants on those parcels zoned for residential land uses, that alleviates much of the need
to establish minimum parcel sizes.

OTHER ITEMS:

The issue of Agricultural Research Institution exemption growers was not discussed in detail due
to the fact that it's likely getting addressed at the state level in the current SB 153 bill and was
already addressed at the July 16, 2019 Board of Supervisors hearing through the approval of
Resolution 2019-209.
The issue of cross-pollination, specifically the potential for cross-contamination of different
hemp varieties as well as hemp and legally grown cannabis, was considered but it was agreed
upon that it was not an issue that could adequately be addressed in this subcommittee,
especially considering the expedited timeline. It was also pointed out by several subcommittee
members that cross-pollination issues in all other agricultural crops is addressed through peer-
to-peer notifications and agreements and is not addressed through regulation or ordinance.

V. SUBCOMMITTEE - AREAS ADDRESSED BUT NO CONSENSUS REACHED

SETBACKS or BUFFERS:

The group could not come to any consensus regarding what distance setbacks or buffers should
be established. Due to the lack of any currently available science on hemp odor issues or
potential grape taint, it was difficult to determine a logical rationale for a specific buffer
distance.
Setback/buffer distances discussed ranged from 50 feet to ½ mile. Using the current
"Agricultural Buffer Policies" in the county's Agriculture Element that is designed for proposed
projects near, or adjacent to, existing agriculture was discussed. Those buffer distances range
from 50 - 600 feet, but again no consensus could be made by the subcommittee.
The potential for a tiered buffer system based on the acreage of a particular hemp cultivation
site was also discussed with no consensus made.

OTHER

The potential for an overlay disallowing hemp cultivation in the Edna Valley area was discussed.
The rationale proposed for this particular overlay concerned the unique climatic factors that
exist in this area, along with the long established wine grape growing region (and the concerns
over potential conflicts such as odor affecting tasting room visitors and terpene taint of grapes
in the field or in wineries/wine production facilities). No consensus was reached on this
proposal.

Notice of General Rule Exemption

Project Title and No.: Industrial Hemp Ordinance LRP2019-0008
Pursuant to section 15061 of the State California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines, the preliminary revlew of a project includes a determination as to whether a project is exempt from CEQA This
checklist represents a summary of this project's review for exemption.

YES NO

Does this project fall within any exempt class as listed in sections 15301 through 15329 of the State CEQA Guidelines? . Z

2. Is there a reasonable possibility that the project could have a significant effect on the
environment due to unusual circumstances? 0 g

3. Is the project inconsistent with any Federal, State, or lacal law or administrative requirement relating to the environment? 0 0

4. Will the project involve substantial public controversy regarding environmental issues? 0 Z

5. Does the project have the potential to degrade the quality of the environment, substantially reduce the habitat of a fish or wildlife species, cause a fish or wildlife population to drop below self-sustaining levels, threaten to eliminate a plant or animal community, reduce the number or restrict the range of a rare or endangered plant or animal or eliminate important examples 0 X

of the major periods of California history or prehistory?

G. Does the project have the potential to achieve short-term environmental goals to the disadvantage of achieving long-term environmental goals? (A short-term impact on the environment i5 one which occurs in a relatively brief, definitive period of time while long-term 0 &
impacts will endure well into the future.)

7. Does the project have adverse impacts that are individually insignificant but cumulatively significant? Cumulatively significant means that the incremental effects of an individual project are substantially adverse when viewed in connection with the effects of past projects, 0 g
the effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable future projects.

8. Does the project have environmental effects which will cause substantial adverse effects on human beings, either directly or indirectly? D g

On the basis of this initial evaluation, I find that the proposed project does not have the potential to cause a significant effect on the environment, and is therefore exempt from CEQA.
