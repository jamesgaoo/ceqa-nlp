VERIFIED I ETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Respondents and Defendants the COUNTY OF LAKE (the "County") and the LAKE COUNTY
2 BOARD OF SUPERVISORS (the "Board") (collectively, "Respondents") as set forth below.
3 INTRODUCTION

4 1. This action challenges the September 15, 2020, decision of the Lake County Board
5 of Supervisors (the "Board) to deny the appeal of Petitioners and approve a Mitigated Negative
6 Declaration ("MND") for Initial Study IS 19-09, and the related approval of Major Use Permit
7 UP 19-05, for the development of a bioenergy production facility (the "Project"). Petitioners and
8 their members live and/or work next to the site for the Project, which seeks to bring an industrial

9 land use-specifically, a biogas facility that includes the onsite chipping of burned trees-with
10 significant potential environmental effects to a scenic corridor and adjacent to residences,
11 businesses, and vineyards. Petitioners presented substantial evidence to the Board of Supervisors
12 of a "fair argument," including extensive evidence prepared by resources experts, that the Project
13 would result in significant environmental impacts. The County, however, did not even bother to
14 respond to these arguments, and approved the Project. Lacking any other recourse, Petitioners
15 were forced to bring this action challenging the Project under the California Environmental
16 Quality Act, Pub. Resources Code, ยง 21000, et seq. ("CEQA").
17 2. Petitioners also seek relief under various other statutes. For example, the County's
18 Code does not provide the County authority to approve the Project within a scenic corridor or on
19 land zoned commercial. In addition, the Project is inconsistent with the both the General Plan
20 and the Rivieras Area Plan, rendering the approval defective under State Planning and Zoning
21 Law, Govt. Code, ยง 65000, et seq. ("PZL.").
22 3. Petitioners thus seek: (1) a writ of mandate pursuant to Sections 21080 and 21080.5
23 of the Public Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure setting
24 aside certain decisions made by Respondents described below and to enforce compliance with
25 CEQA; (2) a writ of mandate pursuant to Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure
26 due to Respondents' failure to comply with State Planning and Zoning Law; (3) a writ of mandate
27 pursuant to Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure due to Respondents' failure
28 to comply with the County Code; (4) a declaratory judgment pursuant to Section 1060 of the Code

Procedure.

3 PARTIES, JURISDICTION AND VENUE

4 4.

5 Petitioner and Plaintiff Citizens for Environmental Protection and Responsible

6 Planning ("CEPRP") is an unincorporated non-profit association based in Lake County,

7 California. CEPRP is dedicated to ensuring that projects carried out within Lake County, and

8 specifically the Red Hills area, are sited, analyzed, and implemented in such a way as to avoid

9 adverse environmental, social, and economic effects. Several of CEPRP's members are local

10 residents and business owners in the area immediately surrounding the Project, and will be

11 affected by the Project's impacts. At least one comment letter was submitted on behalf of CEPRP,

12 and several of its members made objections in writing or orally prior to the close of the September
15, 2020, public hearing.

13 5.

14 Petitioner and Plaintiff Clint Nelson is a resident of Lake County. As a result, he a

15 is directly impacted by the adverse air quality, noise, and other environmental effects associated

16 with the Project. He appealed the Planning Commission's 3-2 vote in favor of the Project, and

17 commented on the Project before both the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors.

6.

18 Petitioner and Plaintiff Matt Walter is a business owner in Lake County. As a

19 result, he and his employees are directly impacted by the adverse air quality, noise, and other

20 environmental effects associated with the Project. He submitted comments on the Project to the
County prior to its approval.

21 7.

22 The maintenance and prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit on

23 the public by protecting the public from the environmental and other harms alleged herein and by

24 ensuring that the County abides by the procedures required under law in approving development

25 projects like the one at issue here. Petitioners are bencficially interested in this matter because

26 they a have a direct interest in ensuring that the Respondents fulfill their duties to comply with
CEQA, State law, and the County's own ordinance code.

27 8.

28 Respondent the County of Lake is a county in the State of California responsible
for administering and carrying out its laws and applicable state laws. The County is the "lead

I1 19373/002/01165554.DOCX} 3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

agency" for conducting the environmental review of the proposed Project for the purposes of
2 Public Resources Code section 21067. The County must comply with CEQA, state law, and its
3 own ordinances.

4 9. Respondent Lake County Board of Supervisors is, and at all times herein mentioned

5 was, the duly elected decision-making body of Respondent County of Lake. As the decision

6 making body, the Board was charged with responsibilities under CEQA for conducting a proper

7 review of the proposed action's environmental impacts and granting the various approvals

8 necessary for the project.

0 10. Petitioners are also informed and believe, and based thereon allege, that Real Party
10 in Interest Thomas Jordan is, and at all times herein mentioned was, the applicant for the approvals
11 granted by the County for the proposed bioenergy production facility.
12 11. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents and Real
13 Parties in Interest fictitiously named Does - through 20 and sues such respondents by
14 fictitious names. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that the
15 fictitiously named respondents and real parties in interest are also responsible for the actions
16 described in this Petition. When the true identities and capacities of these Respondents and/or
17 Real Parties in Interest have been determined, Petitioners will amend this petition, with leave
18 of the court if necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.
19 12. Petitioners and/or their members have performed any and all conditions precedent
20 to the filing of this Petition. Petitioners and/or their members, exhausted any and all
21 administrative remedies required by law by, inter alia, participating in the administrative and

22 environmental review process both in writing and orally at the public hearing evaluating the
23 Project held by the Lake County Planning Commission on April 23, 2020, as well as the appeal
24 of the April 23 approval heard by the Lake County Board of Supervisors on August 18, 2020, and
25 September 15, 2020.

26 13. Petitioners complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code ยง 21167.5 by
27 mailing written notice of this action to Respondents. A copy of the letter providing written notice
28 to Respondents, and proofs of service of the letter, are attached hereto as Exhibit "A."

{9373/002/01165554.DOCX) 4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

14. A copy of this Petition will be served on the Attorney General concurrently with

2 the filing of this Petition pursuant to Section 388 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

3 15. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code ยง21167.6 by filing a

4 request concerning the preparation of the record of administrative proceedings relating to this
action concurrently with this Petition, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit "B."
6 16. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law
7 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their

8 adoption of the MND and approvals for the Project. In the absence of such remedies,

9 Respondents' approvals will remain in effect in violation of state law, and the environment,
10 Petitioners and other residents within the vicinity of the Project will be irreparably harmed. No
11 money damages or legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioners and those residents and
12 property owners for that harm.

13 17. Sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code and sections 1085 and

14 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure provide for review in this Court of actions by state agencies
15 and officers to determine whether those actions comply with CEQA. Sections 525-526 of the
16 Code of Civil Procedure provide for an injunction when it appears that Petitioners are entitled to
17 the relief sought, and section 1060 of the Code of Civil Procedure provides for a judicial
18 declaration of Petitioners' rights and Respondents' duties. Accordingly, and based on the facts
19 stated in this Petition, this Court has jurisdiction to grant declaratory and injunctive relief and to
20 a issue a writ of mandate on the claims presented here.

21 18. Venue in Lake County Superior Court is proper pursuant to section 394 of the Code

22 of Civil Procedure. The County and the Board that approved the Project are located within the
23 County of Lake, and the Project at issue is located within the jurisdictional boundaries of the
24 County of Lake.

25 STATEMENT OF FACTS

26 19. The Project site is located in an area comprised mainly of rural residential, a mix of
27 various kinds of commercial, and agriculture uses. The site for the proposed Project is 7130 Red
28 Hills Rd, Kelseyville, CA, approximately 6 miles east of Kelseyville, on 6 the southeast corner of

19373/002/01165554.DOCX} 5

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 the intersection of State Highway 29 and Red Hills Rd, approximately 900 feet south of the

2 intersection, described as parcel APN: 009-021-07. The site a is a partially developed 34.58-acre

3 lot, split-zoned with approximately 24.5-acres zoned Rural Residential ("RR") and the remainder

4 zoned Highway Commercial ("CH"). The Property is also in a Scenic Combining District ("SC")

5 a and a Design Review Combining District ("DR").

6 20. An RR zoning designation exists "[t]o provide for single-family residential
7 development in a semi-rural setting along with limited agriculture." (Lake County Zoning

8 Ordinance, Art. 8, ยง 21-8) One permitted use in an RR zoned area is a "power generation facility."

9 (Lake County Zoning Ordinance, Art. 27, ยง 27.13(x); see also id., Table B, line (x).) A "power
10 generation facility" is an "electrical generation facility" and is further limited by generating
11 capacity as measured in megawatts. (Lake County Zoning Ordinance, Art. 27, ยง 27.13(x).) A
12 CH zoning designation exists "[t]o provide for the location of the facilities and services needed
13 by the traveling public along the County's major collectors, at intersections with state highways
14 and where they can be reached conveniently and safely." (Lake County Zoning Ordinance, Art.
15 16, ยง 21-16.) A "power generation facility" is not a permitted use in a CH zoned area.
16 21. An SC designated area exists "[t]o protect and enhance views of scenic areas from

17 the County's scenic highways and roadways for the benefit of local residential and resort

18 development, the motoring public, and the recreation based economy in the County." (Lake
19 County Zoning Ordinance, Art. 34, ยง 21-34.) SC designated areas prohibit "[u]ses predominantly
20 utilizing outdoor storage" and "[u]nscreened outdoor storage; except supplies, products, or
21 equipment incidental to a ranch or farm." (Id.) A DR designated area exists "[t]o insure aesthetic
22 compatibility between uses, protect and enhance property values, protect scenic qualities, and
23 promote community character through use of community design manuals." (Lake County Zoning
24 Ordinance, Art. 53, ยง 21-53.)

25 22. Red Hills has been an approved American Viticultural Area since approximately
26 2004. (27 C.F.R. ยง 9.169) This designates an area as an appellation of origin which can be used
27 on wine labels. Over the past several decades, the arca has grown considerably as a major

FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

P appellation in the wine industry, and continues to enjoy considerable success, especially as land

2 prices in Napa and Sonoma Counties have skyrocketed. The climatic conditions in the region are

3 particularly suited to growing high quality grapes, and the relative rarity of conditions which
4 replicate areas like Napa and Sonoma imbues the preservation of the character of Red Hills with

5 a greater degree of importance.

6 23. On or about February 11, 2019, Thomas Jordan filed a request for approval of a
7 Major Use Permit with the Lake County Community Development Department. The permit
8 request was circulated to various agencies and deemed incomplete. More information was

9 requested. Subsequently, the Project was reduced in size, and the applicants decided to hire
10 consultants to prepare an environmental document, pursuant to CEQA requirements.
11 24. On or about January 21, 2020, the County completed its Initial Study and Mitigated
12 Negative Declaration (*IS/MND") IS 19-09 seeking a Major Use Permit for the Project. The
13 IS/MND concluded that the Project, inter alia, would not significantly affect aesthetics in the
14 scenic corridor due to its design features; would not significantly affect agriculture and forestry
15 resources; air quality impacts would be mitigated through the permitting process with the Lake
16 County Air Quality Management District, road surfacing measures, vegetation chipping,
17 prohibitions on burning, and unspecified dust control measures; would have no impact on land
18 use and planning; and noise impacts would be mitigated through standards set during construction
19 and operation for acceptable decibel levels.

20 25. The IS/MND was circulated for public review and filed with the State

21 Clearinghouse on or about January 27, 2020.

22 26. On April 23, 2020, the Planning Commission held a hearing on the Project. Mr.
23 Nelson, members of CEPRP, and other commenting parties raised numerous concerns about the
24 inadequacy of the environmental review and impact of the dust, noise, aesthetics, and other
25 adverse impacts.

26 27. On April 23, 2020, despite the written and oral concerns about the Project, and
27 Respondents' failure to comply with their obligations under CEQA, the Planning Commission
28 adopted the MND and approved the Project on a 3-2 vote.

{9373/002/01165554.DOCX} 7

โข

28. Thereafter, Petitioners appealed the Planning Commission approval of the Project

2 to the Board. Counsel for Petitioners submitted a comment letter supported by substantial expert
3 analysis detailing the reasons why the Project should be denied on the merits. Counsel also

4 detailed the insufficiencies of the environmental review, under CEQA, conducted by the County

5 and the applicants, should the County nonetheless wish to proceed with the Project.
29. Petitioners' comments include an August 17, 2020, letter, with accompanying

7 expert reports. The letter, among other things, presented substantial evidence of a fair argument

8 that the Project would have significant environmental effects. The County has never addressed

9 the extensive concerns raised in the letter in any detail.
10 30. Moreover, the County and Real Parties failed to disclose where crucial components
11 of the Project's operations would take place, such as the primary chipping process, a major
12 concern for the local community given the potential of significant dust creation and damage to
13 local vineyards therefrom. Further, throughout the process, Real Party in Interest and the County
14 continued to change key components of the Project, resulting in an unstable project description.
15 31. The Board of Supervisors conducted two public hearings on the appeal on August
16 18, 2020, and September 15, 2020. After comment was heard, the Board unanimously denied the
17 appeal, and moved to approve the Project.

18 CAUSES OF ACTION

19 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

20 Fair Argument of Significant Impacts in Violation of CEQA

21 32. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to 31
22 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

23 33. CEQA was adopted by the Legislature to prevent environmental harm while
24 providing a decent home and satisfying living for every Californian. The policies and legislative
25 intent behind CEQA are intended to be an integral party of any public agency's decision-making
26 process. CEQA applies to discretionary projects approved by public agencies.
27 34. The County was the "lead agency" responsible for evaluating the Project's
28 environmental impacts under CEQA. As part of this duty, Respondents were required to

| {9373/002/01165554.DOCX; 8

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

I prepare an environmental impact report when substantial evidence in the record supports a

2 "fair argument" that the Project may have a significant impact on a the environment.

3 35. CEQA also required Respondents to adopt feasible mitigation measures to

4 reduce or avoid any significant environmental impacts. If substantial evidence in the record

5 supports a "fair argument" that a project's significant environmental impacts could not be

6 mitigated to a less than significant level, the County is likewise required to prepare a full

7 environmental impact report instead of a mitigated negative declaration.

8 36. Respondents' approval of a development permit constitutes a discretionary act

0 that triggers its obligation to comply with CEQA.

10 37. Respondents violated CEQA by approving the Project because, based on the
11 record, Respondents failed to adequately evaluate and mitigate the Project impacts that may
12 be significant, including, but not limited to:
13 38. Noise. Substantial evidence of a fair argument exists that the Project would result
14 in significant impacts to sensitive nearby receptors, and would result in noise levels in excess of

15 the County Code. Respondents' noise study is also incomplete because it does not address
16 proximate nearby sensitive receptors, and the potential impacts of the Project on those sensitive
17 receptors. Without this analysis, the Initial Study and MND is insufficient under CEQA. (Sec
18 CEQA Guidelines, Appendix G, Subd. XI(a).)

19 39. Aesthetics. Substantial evidence of a fair argument exists that the Project would
20 result in significant aesthetic impacts. The County recognized the Project had the potential to
21 create significant impacts to aesthetics; however, a "fair argument" exists, based on substantial

22 evidence and expert testimony, that the purported "mitigation" recommended by the County
23 would not reduce aesthetic impacts to a less than significant level.

24 40. Agricultural Resources. A fair argument also exists that the Project could result
25 in significant impacts to agricultural resources. The area is populated by several vineyards. It
26 has already been demonstrated that wood chipping from the project could result in significant
27 amounts of windborne dust, which could negatively impact the growth of grapes in the area
28 as well as potentially becoming a vector for the spread of windborne pathogens and fungal,

|| {9373/002/01165554.DOCX]
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- insect, and mite infestations. In addition, the mere presence of the Project-an industrial land
2 use incompatible with the agricultural setting could result in significant impacts to the

3 tourism of the area, which thrives due to the bucolic, agricultural setting.

4 41. Air Quality. A fair argument also exists that the Project could result in
5 significant impacts to air quality in the region. The impacts include dust generation and

6 migration onto nearby properties, causing impacts to nearby agricultural fields, businesses,

7 and residents. In fact, the record included testimony from individuals directly impacted by

8 similar impacts from a health perspective.

9 42. Adverse Health Impacts. There is also a fair argument that the Project could
10 result in significant adverse health impacts. The County is required to analyze the nature and
11 magnitude of the Project's human health impacts in order to comply with the informational
12 goals of CEQA review. (Sierra Club v. County of Fresno (2018) 6 Cal.5th 502, 523 (hereafter
13 Friant Ranch).) The environmental document must discuss the specific health and safety
14 problems that may occur as a result of the Project. (CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15126.2, subd. (a).)
15 Bare air pollutant data will not suffice. Rather the data must be translated into adverse health
16 impacts so that the public will be able to give full consideration to project approval, or the
17 county must explain why such translation is not possible. (Friant Ranch, supra, 6 Cal.5th
18 502, 523.) The County has reccived evidence that adverse health consequences from the

19 subject property have alrcady occurred, and has failed to adequately address this issue in the
20 Initial Study and MND.

21 43. Land Use Impacts. CEQA requires agencies to evaluate whether a proposed a
22 development project will, among other things, conflict with any land use plan, policy, or
23 regulation of an agency with jurisdiction over a project. a A fair argument exists that the Project|
24 as proposed will result in several conflicts with both the County's General Plan, the Rivieras Arca
25 Plan, and the Zoning Code. First, the Project seeks to bring an industrial land use into an area

26 that is predominantly rural residential. This conflicts with sound land use principles, as industrial
27 land uses are typically incompatible with residential land uses, particularly when they are adjacent
28 ///

{9373/002/01165554.DOCX} 10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- to each other. In addition, as explained below, the Project is inconsistent with several policies

2 and programs articulated in the County's General Plan as well as the Rivieras Area Plan.

3 44. The County violated CEQA by failing to prepare an EIR for the Project when

4 the record demonstrates that the Project may cause the potentially significant environmental

5 impacts described above, among others, which have not been adequately disclosed, analyzed,

6 or mitigated to a less than significant level.

7 45. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion, and failed to proceed in a

8 manner required by law, by approving a mitigated negative declaration despite the presence
9 of a fair argument that the Project would have significant environmental effects. Thus,
10 Respondents abused their discretion by failing to prepare an environmental impact report to
11 address the significant environmental impacts.

12 46. Petitioners have a clear, present and beneficial right to performance by
13 Respondents of their duties under CEQA, and Respondents have the duty and capacity to
14 perform their duties under CEQA as the lead agency of the Project. Petitioners also have a
15 clear, present, and beneficial interest in the issuance of a writ of mandate as they are and will be
16 adversely affected by Respondents' violations of CEQA. The failure of Respondents to perform
17 their duties under the law requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate directing them to discharge
18 their duties under CEQA, pursuant to Sections 21080 and 21080.5 of the Public Resources Code

19 and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

20 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

21 Failure to Analyze Cumulative Impacts Violates CEQA

22 47. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs to 46
23 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
24 48. CEQA requires an agency to prepare an EIR for a project whenever substantial
25 evidence in the record supports a fair argument that a project may have a significant a impact on
26 the environment.

27 49. a CEQA requires a significant effect on the environment be found if the possible
28 effects of a project are individually limited, but cumulatively considerable. Cumulatively

Il (9373/002/01165554.DOCX) 11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

considerable effects include past, current, and probable future projects. Failure to eliminate or

2 avoid all potentially significant environmental impacts can invalidate an MND.

50. The County violated CEQA when it approved the Project before failing to

4 adequately analyze the cumulative impacts of the Project. Together with the impacts of other

5 past, current and future projects, the impacts of the Project make an incremental contribution

6 and create a cumulatively considerable impact in violation of CEQA and CEQA Guidelines

7 section 15130(a).

8 51. The County failed to provide any analysis of the cumulative impacts of the
9 Project. There was no analysis of any other past, current, or future projects which could
10 foreseeably contribute to the cumulative impacts of the Project. No substantial evidence has
11 been presented that the Project will not result in significant cumulative impacts to the
12 environment.

13 52. Therefore, there is a fair argument the incremental contributions of the Project will
14 result in a cumulatively considerable condition resulting in a significant impact.

15 53. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by taking the above-described
16 actions in violation of CEQA. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law,
17 and Respondents' decisions were not supported by substantial evidence in the record.
18 Respondents further violated CEQA by failing to independently review and analyze the effects
19 of their actions prior to approving and implementing those actions. The failure of Respondents
20 to perform their duties under the law requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate directing them
21 to discharge their duties under CEQA, pursuant to Sections 21080 and 21080.5 of the Public
22 Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

2 A project for CEQA purposes is "the whole of an action." An environmental review

must encompass

3 and consider the whole of the project, rather than only pieces at a time, prior to

4 an agency approving or implementing any portion of the project or regulation.

56.

5 The County simply presumed that potential impacts of the Project would be

6 lessened or avoided through design features and project-specific actions, but did not in its

7 approval of the Project actually require that the Project be designed in any particular way. This

8 and other inadequacies of the Project description, mitigation measures, and impacts analysis

9 require that the Project be refined and changed. The approval of the Project in its current form,
without the required augmentations and additions, seeks to impermissibly piecemeal or segment
10 environmental review.

11 57.

12 The County also violated CEQA when it failed to require the applicant to disclose

13 the location and potential impacts of the primary chipping process, including transportation of the

14 material to the Project. Omission of ancillary but integral parts of the project obscures important

15 impacts from the view of the public, in derogation of the informational purposes of CEQA.

16 (Santiago Water Dist. v. County of Orange (1981) 118 Cal.App.3d 818, 830.)

58.

17 Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by taking the above-described

18 actions in violation of CEQA. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and

19 Respondents' decisions were not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Respondents

20 further violated CEQA by failing to independently review and analyze the effects of their actions
prior to approving and implementing those actions.

21 59.

22 Petitioners also have a clear, present, and beneficial interest in the issuance of a

23 writ of mandate by virtue of the facts set forth in this Petition, in that they are and will continue

24 to be adversely affected by Respondents' continuing violations of CEQA. The failure of

25 Respondents to perform their duties under the law requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate

26 directing them to discharge their duties under CEQA, pursuant to Sections 21080 and 21080.5 of

27 the Public Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 Inadequate and Incomplete Project Description

3 60. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to 59
4 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

5 61. To adequately and accurately assess the potential effects of any project, CEQA

6 requires that the lead agency prepare a project description that includes reasonably foreseeable
7 future activities that are consequences of the project. In addition, the entire project being
8 proposed (and not some smaller aspect of it), must be described in the environmental document.

9 The above requirements reflects the CEQA Guideline's definition of a "project" as the "whole of
10 an action." (CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15378.)
11 62. The Initial Study and MND fail to provide an accurate and stable project
12 description. After the Initial Study and MND were circulated for public review, changes were
13 proposed which are required to bring review of the Project in compliance with CEQA. The failure
14 to augment the Project Description in the ways necessary to bring the environmental document
15 into compliance rendered the Project Description inadequate and unstable.
16 63. Further, the Initial Study and MND do not describe the whole of the action, but
17 rather a future hypothetical facility that has not been specifically proposed. The Project itself is
18 merely the issuance of a Major Use Permit, meaning that an applicant in the future could construct

19 a vastly expanded facility without adequate operational measures. This is of particular concern
20 because the applicant and the County made several representations about components of the
21 Project that would purportedly lessen environmental impacts; however, most if not all of those

22 representations were not incorporated into the Project approvals in a legally binding manner, such
23 as mitigation measures or conditions of approval.
24 64. Further, the Project Description and the discussion of existing conditions/baseline
25 are insufficient to fully and accurately analyze the environmental impacts of the Project. The
26 Initial Study and MND do not adequately analyze crucial information, such as emissions
27 generation by equipment used in the Project and impacts of the primary chipping process, and
28 also fail to adequately discuss the baseline conditions in relation to the impacts of the Project.
II {9373/002/01165554.DOCX} 14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 65. By proceeding in this manner, Respondents failed to prepare a project description

2 that includes reasonably foreseeable future activities that are consequences of the project, and
3 also failed to describe the entire project being proposed.

4 66. Respondents therefore prejudicially abused their discretion by taking the above-

5 described actions in violation of CEQA. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required

6 by law, and Respondents' decisions were not supported by substantial evidence in the record.
7 Respondents further violated CEQA by failing to independently review and analyze the effects

8 of their actions prior to approving and implementing those actions. The failure of Respondents

9 EO perform their duties under the law requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate directing them
10 to discharge their duties under CEQA, pursuant to Sections 21080 and 21080.5 of the Public

11 Resources Code and Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

12 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

13 Failure to Analyze/Mitigate Significant Environmental Effects
14 67. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to 66
15 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
16 68. CEQA requires a lead agency to first determine the full extent of a project's impacts
17 before it may apply mitigation measures to reduce those impacts. A lead agency may not avoid

18 analysis by simply presuming a design feature will be incorporated into the project to lessen an
19 environmental effect, without any binding commitment to ensure the design feature will be
20 implemented.

21 69. Following a full and adequate review of a project's potential environmental effects,
22 the lead agency must bind itself and/or the applicant to ensure mitigation will actually occur
23 through conditions of approval, contracts, Or other methods. This requirement is intended to
24 ensure that mitigation measures will actually be implemented, not merely adopted and then
25 ignored.

26 70. In this case, the MND simply asserted the applicant would incorporate various
27 design features into the Project that were intended to prevent the occurrence of or minimize the
28 significance of adverse environmental effects. The MND then relied upon these alleged design

{9373/002/01165554.DOCX} 15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT
FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

โข 1 features to assert that the Project would not result in significant impacts as to, inter alia, air

2 quality, aesthetics, agricultural resources, land use planning, and noise, without discussing the

3 severity of the impact prior to mitigation, and without incorporating the alleged design features

4 as binding mitigation measures.

5 71. By proceeding in this fashion, Respondents impermissibly (i) side-stepped analysis

6 of the Project's potentially significant environmental effects, and (ii) failed to adopt binding
7 mitigation necessary to ensure those effects would not occur. This is impermissible under CEQA.

8 (Lotus v. Dept. of Trans. (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th 645, 651-52.)

L 72. Respondents also failed to require enforceable mitigation, instead relying upon
10 mere non-binding statements about features that may or may not be incorporated into the Project.
11 73. Respondents also impermissibly deferred mitigation by waiting until after Project
12 approval to formulate solutions for the Project's potential environmental impacts, in violation of
13 CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15126.4(A)(1)(B).)
14 74. Respondents also adopted impermissibly vague mitigation measures that do not
15 provide any standards against which to determine the efficacy or design or the proposed
16 mitigation, in violation of CEQA.

17 75. Respondents also impermissibly adopted mitigation that is insufficient to reduce

18 potential environmental effects to a less than significant level, contrary to CEQA's requirements.
19 76. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by taking the above-described
20 actions in violation of CEQA. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and
21 Respondents' decisions were not supported by substantial evidence in the record. Respondents
22 further violated CEQA by failing to independently review and analyze the effects of their actions
23 prior to approving and implementing those actions. Respondents' failure to perform their duties
24 under the law requires this Court to issue a writ of mandate directing them to discharge their
25 duties under CEQA, pursuant to Sections 21080 and 21080.5 of the Public Resources Code and
26 Sections 1085 and 1094.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

3 Inconsistency with the Lake County General Plan

77.

4 Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs I to 76
in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

5 78.

6 State planning and zoning law requires that all land-use decisions of counties must

7 be consistent with the county's General Plan. (Govt. Code, ยง 65860, subd. (a); see also Corona-

8 Norco Unif. Sch. Dist. v. City of Corona (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 985, 994.) A "project is consistent

9 with the general plan if, considering all its aspects, it will further the objectives and policies of

10 the general plan and not obstruct their attainment." (Corona-Norco, supra, 17 Cal.App.4th at
994.)

11 79.

12 "A project is inconsistent if it conflicts with a general plan policy that is

13 fundamental, mandatory, and clear." (Endangered Habitats League, Inc. V. County of Orange
(2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 777, 782.)
14 80.

15 Despite this requirement, the Project is inconsistent with numerous provisions of
the Lake County General Plan in the following ways:

16 a.

17 The Project discourages, diminishes, and undermines agriculture

18 and agricultural tourism, and in particular the wine industry.

b.

19 The Project diminishes and undermines existing quality of life

20 standards, particularly to nearby residents and businesses, due to

21 noise, dust migration, aesthetic impacts, and other issues.

C.

22 The Project fails to direct growth toward existing communities,
thereby failing to preserve open space
23 because it will result in an

industrial use in an otherwise bucolic area.

24 d.

25 The Project is incompatible with adjacent residential, commercial,
and agricultural uses.
26 C.

27 The Project fails to contemplate any agricultural buffers or

setbacks.

3 g. The Project contemplates access from a residential area.

4 h. The Project fails to be permitted under a planned development

5 process, though the property is over five acres in size.
6 i The Project is not a high-quality development that will entice

7 visitors, businesses, and permanent residents to the area; rather, it

8 will undermine such attractive features.

Q โข- Placing an industrial land use in the middle of vineyards and
10 tasting rooms is inconsistent with community pride and reliance
11 upon the continued success of the wine industry.

12 k. The industrial facility will interfere with visual access to the
13 hillsides, vineyards, and other distinctive natural areas.
14 1. The Project does not contemplate adequate screening of the
15 facility, including visual impacts.
16 m. There is nothing in the Project approval to ensure code
17 enforcement will ensure any nuisances are abated.
18 n. The Project will lessen the value of, and undermine, the Red Hills
19 AVA. In addition, operations at the project site have already
20 interfered with nearby commercial and residential uses.
21 O. To the extent the Project could be considered to include an electric
22 facility, the facility would not be appropriately sited to minimize
23 environmental and other impacts.
24 p. The Project does not contemplate the paving of all internal roads
25 used by trucks. In addition, there is a significant likelihood of

26 continued dust associated with the Project.

12 Inconsistency with the Rivieras Area Plan

13 82. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs 1 to 81
14 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

15 83. State planning and zoning law requires that all land-use decisions of counties must
16 be consistent with the county's plan-level documents, including specific, community, and area-
17 level plans. (See, e.g., Govt. Code, ยง 65860, subd. (a); see also Corona-Norco Unif. Sch. Dist.
18 V. City of Corona (1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 985, 994.) A "project is consistent with the general plan
19 if, considering all its aspects, it will further the objectives and policies of the general plan and not
20 obstruct their attainment." (Corona-Norco, supra, 17 Cal.App.4th at 994.)

22 fundamental, mandatory, and clear." (Endangered Habitats League, Inc. v. County of Orange
23 (2005) 131 Cal.App.4th 777, 782.) Despite this requirement, the Project is inconsistent with is the
24 Rivieras Area Plan in the following ways:

25 a. The Project contemplates an industrial land use adjacent to
26 agricultural and agri-tourism uses, thus undermining those uses.
27 b. No buffer zones were incorporated into this Project, involving
28 adjoining dissimilar uses, to reduce land use conflicts.

{9373/002/01165554.DOCX} 20

L C. The Project is not a low density use.

2 d.

3 The Project is a new non-agricultural uses in an agricultural area

4 that can interfere with normal agricultural operations and its

5 necessary accessory uses. The Project interferes directly with
those uses through dust and pathogen migration, as well as

6 interfering with agri-tourism and tasting rooms.
7 e.

8 The Project fails to protect and enhance scenic resources in the

O Rivieras Planning Area and promote a visually appealing

10 environment by placing an industrial facility near a scenic

11 roadway, and in a place where it can be visible from, and on the
way toward, tasting rooms.
12 f

13 The Project does not maintain the rural character of the planning

area.

14 g.

15 The Project contemplates above-ground facilities where it is
feasible to construct underground utilities.
16 h.

17 The industrial facilities interfere with the rural vista, both from the
scenic roadway, as well as nearby tasting rooms.

19 The Project is not designed to relate to the dominant character of

20 the corridor, or of the particular segment of the corridor, through

21 regulations concerning building form, site location and density of

use.

22

23 The Project does not incorporate the highest architectural,

24 functional, cost-effective, and environmental quality design.

k. The Project does not protect the health of residents of the Rivieras

25

26 Planning Area from poor or diminished air quality. Wood

27 chipping operations have interfered with the health of nearby

28 residents and employccs. The Project contemplates that those
activities would be permitted, continue, and promoted.

I. The Project does not maintain clear visibility for the area's view

2 sheds.

3 m. The Project conflicts with existing development.

4 n. The Project does not promote development of agricultural uses or

5 support the continued viability of Lake County's agricultural

6 economy.

7 O. The Project is not designed to provide a buffer in the form of a

8 setback of sufficient distance to avoid land use conflicts between

9 the agricultural use and the non-agricultural use. Such setback or
10 buffer areas has not been established by recorded easement or
11 other instrument that reserves it in perpetuity. Further, no method
12 or mechanism for local organizations to enforce such a setback has
13 been developed.

14 85. In addition, the County did not address the correct area plan. Specifically, the
15 County's analysis purported to address the conformity of the Project with the Kelseyville Area
16 Plan. Although Petitioners brought this to the County's attention, Respondents never corrected
17 this foundational issue.

18 86. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by taking the above-described
19 actions in violation of CEQA and the Rivieras Area Plan. Respondents failed to proceed in the
20 manner required by law, and Respondents' decisions were not supported by substantial evidence
21 in the record. Respondents further violated CEQA by failing to independently review and analyze
22 the effects of their actions prior to approving and implementing those actions. Pursuant to section

FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- 88.

2 In this proceeding, Respondents took the position that the Project was permissible

3 subject to the issuance of a Major Use Permit under its Zoning Ordinance. Specifically, the

4 County's Zoning Ordinance allows the construction of a "power generation facility" of less than

5 3 Mega Watts in residential zoning districts, subject to the issuance of a Major Use Permit under

6 Sections 21-8.5(l), 21-27.10 [Table B], and 21-51.4 of the Lake County Zoning Ordinance.

89.

7 The County, however, did not comply with these provisions or other provisions of
its own Zoning Ordinance:

8 a.

Q The County did not include substantial evidence in the record that

10 the Project is "power generation facility" under Section 21-27(x)
of the Zoning Ordinance.

11 b.

12 The County did not include substantial evidence in the record that,

13 if the Project is a "power generation facility," that it would
generate less than 3MW.
14 C.

15 The Project is not permitted because portions of the "power

16 generation facility" are required to tie-in to facilities on portions

17 of the property that are zoned commercial, within which "power

18 generation facilities" are not permitted. Indeed, County staff

19 essentially conceded the Project was partially within the

20 commercial areas of the property by performing a General Plan

21 conformity analysis for the portion of the property with a

22 Community Commercial land use designation.

d.

23 Portions of the Project are located within a scenic corridor, and
thus not permitted.

24 90.

25 Respondents also abused their discretion, and failed to support their findings with

26 substantial evidence, when they approved the Major Use Permit. Specifically, Section 21-51.4

27 of the Lake County Zoning Ordinance requires, in order to approve a Major Use Permit, that the

28 County ensure "[t]hat the establishment, maintenance, or operation of the use applied for will not
under the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety, morals, comfort

/ 19373/002/01165554.DOCX 23

FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

and general welfare of the persons residing or working in the neighborhood of such proposed use,

2 or be detrimental to the property and improvement in the neighborhood or the general welfare of
3 the County." (Lake County Zoning Ordinance, Art. 51, ยง 21-51.4) The findings also require

4 assurances of public safety, consistency with the General Plan, and confirmation that no code

5 violations exist.

91. As a result of the various violations of CEQA, State Planning and Zoning Law, the

7 Lake County General Plan, the Rivieras Area Plan, and the Lake County Ordinance Code, (see
8 generally, supra) the County cannot make the findings required under its own regulations to

9 approve the Project. The failure of the Board to fully analyze the environmental impacts of the
10 Project precludes its ability to determine with certainty that the Project's impacts on the air
11 quality, noise, aesthetics, land use planning, and agricultural resources will not "be detrimental to

12 the health, safety, morals, comfort and general welfare of the persons residing or working in the
13 neighborhood of such proposed use, or be detrimental to the property and improvement in the
14 neighborhood or the general welfare of the County." (Id.)
15 92. Pursuant to section 65000, et seq., of the Government Code, Petitioners are entitled
16 to petition this Court for a writ of mandate enjoining Respondents to comply with State Planning
17 and Zoning Law.

18 NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION

19 Declaratory Relief

20 93. Petitioners re-allege and incorporate by reference the precedent paragraphs to 92
21 in their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.

22 94. With respect to the violations of law alleged in the First through Eighth Causes of
23 Action, there exists a clear and actual controversy between Petitioners and Respondents regarding
24 Respondents' failures to comply with CEQA, the Lake County General Plan, the Rivieras Area
25 Plan, and the Lake County Ordinance Code. Petitioners contend that Respondents have not
26 complied with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, the Lake County General Plan, the Rivieras Area

2 Respondents under CEQA, State Planning and Zoning Law, the Lake County General Plan, the

3 Rivieras Area Plan, and Lake County Ordinance Code, and declaration that Respondents have

4 not complied with its duties under those provisions. Such declarations are a necessary and proper

5 exercise of this Court's power under section 1060 of the Code of Civil Procedure and under

6 section 65000 of the Government Code, to prevent violation of the Government Code, which

7 requires that all valid regulations shall be made "in accordance with standards prescribed by other
