2 INTRODUCTION

3 1. Petitioner CITY OF ROCKLIN respectfully petitions this Court for a writ of

4 mandate ordering the TOWN OF LOOMIS and the TOWN COUNCIL OF THE TOWN OF

5 LOOMIS to rescind its August 11, 2020, decision to certify an environmental impact report

9 on Sierra College Boulevard and adding a fourth traffic signal on the half-a-mile long corridor

10 between I-80 and Taylor Road in the TOWN OF LOOMIS (*Project"). As set forth below, the

11 TOWN's approval of the Project violates the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"),

12 Public Resources Code §§21000 et seq., the CEQA Guidelines, the California Planning and

13 Zoning Law, and the LOOMIS General Plan and Zoning Code. Petitioner seeks a writ of

14 mandate directing the Respondents to set aside the approval of the Project pursuant to Code of

15 Civil Procedure §§ 1085 and 1094.5.

18 under the laws of the State of California and located in Placer County. ROCKLIN has a direct

19 and substantial beneficial interest in: (i) ensuring that Respondents comply with CEQA as a

20 result of ROCKLIN's status as a responsible agency (Title 14, Cal. Code of Regs. §15231), and

21 (i) ensuring the shared infrastructure between Respondents and ROCKLIN continues to operate

22 safely and effectively, and, thus, bring this Petition on behalf of the residents of the ROCKLIN

16 STATEMENT OF FACTS

17 The Project

18 17. COSTCO sought LOOMIS' approval -of a zoning code amendment, Use Permit,

19 Design Review Permit and Lot Line Adjustment for the construction and operation of a 155,000

20 square foot Costco Warehouse retail store, as well as a fueling station with up to 30 fueling

21 positions (*Project"). The services to be provided would include mostly warehouse retail space,

22 while also including optical exams and sales, a photo processing center, hearing aid testing and

23 sales, food service preparation and sales, alcohol sales and tasting and a tire service center.

24 18. The Project site is an approximately 17.4-acre site located on at the northwest

25 corner of Sierra College Boulevard and Brace Road. The Project site abuts the
26 ROCKLIN/LOOMIS border to the south and is across the street from the ROCKLIN/LOOMIS

27 .border to-the west.

1 19.

2 The Project site has a land use designation of General Commercial, Residential

3 High Density and Residential Medium High Density in the LOOMIS General Plan and is zoned

4 General Commercial ("CG"), High Density Residential (*RH") and Medium Density Residential
("RM-5").

5 20.

6 The Project site is directly adjacent to the Sierra Meadows apartment complex on
the north end of the site and several single-family homes along the eastern boundary of the
Jouedns JeoelA Court Accepted through eDelivery WA 7.G:67:00 1e 07.07.-+0-60 pammugns 7 Project site.

8 21. There is one main driveway access to the Project site located approximately 750

10 feet south of Brace Road. There are two secondary access routes into the site via Brace Road.

11 The first secondary access is a right-in-right-out only access that is to be primarily used for

12 delivery trucks, though also publicly accessible, located approximately 215 feet east of Sierra

13 College Boulevard. The second secondary access is a gate-controlled access to be used only for
emergency purposes,

14 located to the east of the Sierra Meadows apartment complex at the north

15 end of the Project site. A third potential secondary access point is located to the south near the

16 southeast corner of the Project site. Development of this access point requires land use

17 permitting approval by ROCKLIN due to the need to cross private property before connecting to
Granite Drive.

18 Environmental Review Process

19 22.

20 LOOMIS filed A Notice of Preparation of a Draft Environmental Impact Report
for the Project with the State Clearinghouse on or about May 15, 2017.

21 23.

22 LOOMIS circulated a Draft Environmental Impact Report ("DEIR") for the
Project in June 2018.

23 24.

24 Petitioner submitted written comments on the DEIR, noting that that the DEIR

25 failed to adequately analyze the Project's environmental impacts, including, but not limited to

26 transportation impacts and alternatives analysis, among other issues. Several other individuals

27 and government agencies also commented on the inadequate environmental review of the DEIR.
25.

28 LOOMIS circulated a Revised Draft Environmental Impact Report ("RDEIR")
for the Project in December 2019.
-6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 26. Petitioner submitted written comments on the RDEIR, noting that that the RDEIR

2 failed to adequately analyze the Project's environmental impacts, including, but not limited to

3 transportation, air quality, greenhouse gases and noise impacts, the VMT analysis and

4 alternatives analysis, among other issues.

5 27. LOOMIS then released a Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") for the

6 Project in June 2020.

7 Project Approval ‡
7.9:67:70 1e 07.07.-+0-60 pemwans Kiesijene ubnouu peideoov unon Jouedns Jeoeld 8 28. On July 7, 2020, the LOOMIS Planning Commission ("Planning Commission")

9 held a public hearing on the EIR and the Project. Petitioner submitted a written comment letter

10 and representatives of Petitioner attended the public hearing via LOOMIS' YouTube webcast of

11 the hearing, objecting to the certification of the EIR and approval of the Project. Among other

12 objections, the letter argued that the EIR failed to disclose certain data Respondents used to

13 support its assumptions in the traffic impact analysis and VMT analyses for the Project, that the

14 EIR failed to disclose all of the potentially significant traffic-related impacts, the inadequacy of
15 the alternatives analysis, inadequate responses to comments, Project inconsistencies with
16 fundamental Loomis General Plan policies, and inconsistencies with the LOOMIS zoning code.

17 After Petitioner and other members of the public made comments, the Planning Commission
18 closed the public hearing and voted to recommend that the LOOMIS COUNCIL certify the EIR

19 and approve the Project,

20 29, On Or about August 4, 2020, Petitioner submitted a written comment letter to the

21 LOOMIS COUNCIL, again pointing out that the EIR was inadequate and could not support the

22 approval of the Project. Among other objections, the letter argued that the EIR failed to disclose

23 certain data Respondents used to support its assumptions in the traffic impact analysis and VMT

24 analyses for the Project, that the EIR failed to disclose all of the potentially significant traffic-

25 related impacts, the inadequacy of the alternatives analysis, Project inconsistencies with

26 fundamental Loomis General Plan policies, and inconsistencies with the LOOMIS zoning code.
27 30. On August 4, 2020, the LOOMIS COUNCIL held a public hearing on the EIR

28 and the Project and introduced Ordinance No. 285 that amended certain provisions of the
-7-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 LOOMIS zoning code as part of the Project. A representative of Petitioner attended the hearing

2 and voiced objections to certification of the EIR and approval of the Project. The LOOMIS

3 COUNCIL closed the public hearing and continued the item to August 11, 2020.

4 31. On August 11, 2020, the LOOMIS COUNCIL held a second public hearing on

5 the Project, including the second reading and adoption of Ordinance No. 285, and certified the

6 EIR and approved the Project. The certification of the EIR, adoption of the ordinance, approval
submitted 09-04-2020 at 04:29:52 PM Court Accepted through eDelivery Placer Superior 7 of a lot line adjustment, and approval of a use permit and design review constitutes

8 Respondents' approval of the Project.

9 32. LOOMIS filed its Notice of Determination for the Project on or about August 12,

10 2020.

11 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION For Writ of Mandamus [CCP § 1094.5, or alternatively § 1085| For 12 Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq. 13 (Against All Respondents)
14 33. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 32,

15 inclusive, of this Petition/Complaint, as if fully set forth below.

16 34. CEQA requires the lead agency for a project with the potential to cause
17 significant environmental impacts to prepare an EIR that complies with the requirements of the
18 statute, including, but not limited to, the requirement to analyze the project's potentially

19 significant environmental impacts. The EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such

20 that the decisionmakers can intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on

21 the proposed project. Additionally, the EIR must analyze mitigation measures and an adequate

22 range of alternatives to the project.

23 35. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency adopt feasible mitigation measures that
24 would reduce or avoid any of a project's significant environmental impacts. If any of the
25 project's significant impacts cannot be mitigated to a less than significant level, then CEQA bars

26 the lead agency from approving a project if a feasible alternative is available that would meet the
27 project's objectives while avoiding or reducing its significant environmental impacts.
28

-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 36.

2 CEQA further mandates that a lead agency may approve a project that would

3 have significant, unavoidable environmental impacts only if the agency finds that the project's
benefits would outweigh its unavoidable impacts.

4 37. CEQA requires that an agency's findings for the approval of a project be

5

6 supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record and requires that an agency

7 provide an explanation of how the record evidence supports the conclusions the agency has

È reached.

Placer Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery 7.9:67:70 1e 07.07:-+0-60 pemmqns 8 38. Respondents violated CEQA by certifying an EIR for the Project that is

10 inadequate and fails to comply with the requirements of CEQA and the Guidelines. Among
other defects, the EIR:

11 a.

12 Failed to adequately disclose, analyze or mitigate the Project's significant
impacts on the environment, including, but not limited to, the Project's impacts on

13

14 transportation, vehicle miles traveled, air quality, greenhouse gases, noise, aesthetics, land
use/planning and climate change;

15 b.

16 Failed to adequately disclose, analyze, or mitigate the Project's
significant cumulative impacts;

17 C.

18 Failure to evaluate a reasonable range of alternatives to the Project;

d.

19 Failed to identify feasible mitigation measures to reduce or avoid the

20 impacts of the Project, including, but not limited to the adoption of mitigation for traffic impacts
on the Sierra College Boulevard corridor;

21 e.

22 Improperly deferred mitigation and analysis of Project impacts, including,
but not limited to the mitigation of noise impacts.

23 39.

24 Respondents further violated CEQA by failing to recirculate the EIR after adding

25 substantial new information to the Final EIR, including, but not limited to a new vehicle miles

26 traveled ("VMT") study for the Project in the Final EIR, thus depriving the public of a
meaningful opportunity to review and comment on this new information.

27

28

-9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 40. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter

2 of law in that they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including, but not

3 limited to the following findings:

4 a. The determination that alternatives to the Project that would allegedly

5 meet the Project objectives and avoid or lessen the significant impacts of the Project are

6 infeasible or nonexistent. Instead of substantial evidence, Respondents' findings are based on

Wd 7.9:67:50 7 unsupported, and demonstrably self-serving and inaccurate assertions by COSTCO, the Project's

8 applicant;

9 b. The Respondents' determination that various mitigation measures,

& 10 including, but not limited to additional roadway improvements on Sierra College Boulevard, that
Placer Jouedns Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 09-04-2020 11 would lessen the significant impacts of the Project allegedly are infeasible or non-existent;

12 C. The Respondents' determination that certain impacts would be less than

13 significant and/or that adopted mitigation measures allegedly would reduce the Project's impacts

14 on the environment to a less than significant level.

15 41. Respondents further violated CEQA by adopting findings that do not provide the

16 reasoning, or analytic route, from facts to conclusions as required by law.

17 42. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents prejudicially abused their
18 discretion by certifying an EIR, making findings, and taking related actions that do not comply

19 with the requirements of CEQA. As such, Respondents' certification of the EIR and approval of
