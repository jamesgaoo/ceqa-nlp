INTRODUCTION

1. This action challenges the approvals by Respondent Board of Forestry and Fire Protection
("Board" or "Respondent") and Respondent California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection
("Department" or "Respondent") of the California Vegetation Treatment Program ("CalVTP" or

5 "Program"), and the related failure to comply with the California Environmental Quality Act
6 ("CEQA"), Pub. Res. Code § 21000, et seq.

7 2. Among other things, Respondents failed to consider the environmental impacts associated

8 with the Program, failed to prepare and circulate required environmental analysis, and failed to

9 consider and adopt feasible alternatives and mitigation.

10 3. Additionally, Respondents failed to comply with requirements of the Public Resources

11 Code.

12 4. Petitioner seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate declaring Respondents'

13 approvals invalid, and enjoining Respondents from taking steps to implement the approvals.

14 PARTIES

15 5. Petitioner California Chaparral Institute ("CCI" or "Petitioner") is a non-profit research and

16 educational organization dedicated to the preservation of California's native chaparral ecosystem, helping

17 communities adapt to the fire-prone environments in which they live, and improving the physical and

18 mental health of individuals through reconnections with Nature. Petitioner and its members have been

19 injured as a result of Respondent's actions. Petitioner and its members use, enjoy, and benefit from the

20 resources affected by Respondent's actions. Respondent's actions adversely affect the aesthetic,
21 | recreational, economic, environmental, and health and safety interests of Petitioner and of Petitioner's

22 members. The interests of Petitioner and Petitioner's members have been and will continue to be

23 adversely affected by Respondent's unlawful actions. The relief sought in this Petition would redress

24 Petitioner's and Petitioner's members' injuries.

25 6. Petitioner Endangered Habitats League ("EHL" or "Petitioner") is a is a tax-exempt non-

26 profit California corporation dedicated to the conservation of native ecosystems and to sustainable land

27 use and transportation planning. Since 1991, EHL has engaged in planning partnerships across Southern

28 California and worked to create habitat preserve systems, whose ecosystem functions are threatened by

1 Program approval. EFIL members live and enjoy the biological diversity in areas proposed for treatment

2 and degradation under the CalVTP. Petitioner and its members have been injured as result of

3 Respondent's actions. Petitioner and its members use, enjoy, and benefit from the resources affected by

4 Respondent's actions. Respondent's actions adversely affect the aesthetic, recreational, economic,

5 environmental, and health and safety interests of Petitioner and of Petitioner's members. The interests of

6 Petitioner and Petitioner's members have been and will continue to be adversely affected by Respondent's

7 unlawful actions. The relief sought in this Petition would redress Petitioner' s and Petitioner's members'

8 injuries.

9 7. Respondent Board of Forestry and Fire Protection is a government-appointed body within the

10 California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. It is responsible for developing the general forest
11 policy of the state, determining the guidance policies of the Department, and representing the state's

12 interest in federal forestland in California.

13 8. Respondent California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection is the State of California's

14 agency responsible for fire protection in State Responsibility Areas of California, as well as the
15 administration of the state's private and public forests.

16 9. Petitioners do not know the true names or capacities of the persons or entities sued herein as

17 Does 1 through 5, and therefore sue these respondents by such fictitious names, Petitioners will amend

18 the Petition to set forth the names and capacities of said respondents along with appropriate charging

19 allegations when the same have been ascertained.

20 PROJECT DESCRIPTION AND HISTORY

21 10. Since the 1980's, the California Legislature has recognized an increase in the number of

22 uncontrolled fires on wildlands in the State, resulting in destruction of important natural resources, loss

23 of recreation opportunities, and hazards to public safety.

24 11. On October 30, 2015, Governor Jerry Brown proclaimed a State of Emergency related to

25 the occurrence of extensive tree mortality throughout the State.

26 12. On May 10, 2018, Governor Brown issued Executive Order B-52-18, which, among other

27 things, required improved forest management and restoration.

28

v. California Chaparral Institute v. Board of Forestry and Fire Protection Page
Writ Petition

1 13. A report prepared by the California Governor's Wildfire Strike Force in 2019 asserted:

2 "Climate change has created a new wildfire reality for California. The state's fire season is now almost

3 year round. More than 25 million acres of California wildlands are classified as under very high or

4 extreme fire threat."

5 14. The Board has described its California Vegetation Treatment Program as intended "to treat
vegetation that could become fire fuel" and "to serve as one component of the state's range of actions

7 to reduce wildfire risk and diminish or avoid the harmful effects of wildfire on people, property, and
natural resources with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's (CAL FIRE's) State

9 Responsibility Area (SRA). The SRA is an area of more than 31 million acres of private and public

10 land

11 15. The Board has claimed: "The treatable landscape, which is the portion of the SRA where

12 vegetation conditions are suitable for treatment, consists of approximately 20.3 million acres. As part

13 of the CalVTP, CAL FIRE and other project proponents would implement vegetation treatment

14 activities on up to approximately 250,000 acres annually within the treatable landscape."

15 16. The Board has stated: "The proposed CalVTP consists of three treatment types: wildland-

16 urban interface (WUI) fuel reduction, fuel breaks, and ecological restoration." It has identified five

17 objectives of the Program:

18 a. "serve as the vegetation management component of the state's range of actions

19 underway to reduce risks to life, property, and natural resources ...";

20 b. "substantially increase the pace and scale of vegetation treatments to contribute to a

21 statewide total of at least 500,000 acres per year on non-federal lands ...";

22 c. "increase the use of prescribed burning as a vegetation a treatment tool ...";

23 d. "*contribute to meeting California's GHG emission goals by managing forests and other

24 natural and working lands as a net carbon sink ..."; and

25 e. "improve ecosystem health in fire-adapted habitats by safely mimicking the effects of a

26 natural fire regime, considering historic fire return intervals, climate change, and land

27 use constraints."

28

California Chaparral Institute v. Board of Forestry and Fire Protection Page 4
Writ Petition

17. The Board has identified five "treatment activities" to meet these objectives: prescribed

2 burning, mechanical treatment, manual treatment, prescribed herbivory, and application of herbicides.

3 18. The Board has also identified several "Standard Project Requirements" ("SPR's"), which, it
4 claims, "are intended to avoid and minimize environmental impacts and comply with applicable laws

5 and regulations."

6 19. On June 24, 2019, the Board issued a draft Environmental Impact Report regarding the
7 Program. Numerous comments were submitted on the DEIR, including from Petitioners. Among other

8 things, they noted concerns about the Program's impacts to human health, community protection, air

9 quality, greenhouse gas emissions, biological resources and habitat, wetlands, wildlife movement,
10 public safety, water quality, hazardous and toxic substances, historical and cultural resources,

11 watersheds, open space, land use, community character, aesthetics, and public services, as well as

12 cumulative impacts.

13 20. Comments also noted the EIR's failure to adequately describe the Program and to discuss

14 the environmental baseline.

15 21. Comments also noted the EIR's failure to consider and adopt sufficient mitigation measures

16 and alternatives to address the Program's significant impacts.

17 22. Comments, including from Petitioner, noted that none of California's most devastating
18 wildfires have been significantly influenced by dead trees and most of these fires were far from forested
19 landscapes and for those few devastating fires that were near forests, including the Camp Fire, all of the

20 forests around the communities destroyed by fire had the types of suggested thinning and fuel treatments
21 prescribed by the CalVTP.

22 23. Comments also noted that thinning forests and creating large areas of clearance with little or

23 no vegetation creates conditions that increase the rate of fire movement, facilitates the spread of embers,

24 and allows for increased wind speeds that create a "bowling alley" effect for embers to target structures,
25 the key factor in home ignition.

26 24. A Final EIR ("FEIR") was published on November 27, 2019.

27 25. The EIR noted it would be the only analysis of the Program's impacts in many instances. It

28 claimed the EIR "functions as a Program EIR in accordance with State CEQA Guidelines Section

Callfornia Chaparral Institute v. Board of Forestry and Fire Protection Writ Petition Page 5

1 15168(c) for streamlining later activities." Regarding future activities of CAL FIRE "or other project

2 proponents," the EIR stated that if "the project proponent finds that the impacts were analyzed in the

3 PEIR, no additional CEQA documentation would need to be prepared or publicly circulated." The

4 EIR also asserted this approach "would facilitate an increase in the pace and scaled of project
approvals" and claimed: "If a later EIR is prepared, it could be limited in its scope to the new or

6 substantially more severe impact ....M
26. Numerous additional comments, including from Petitioners, were received regarding the

8 Program and FEIR. These comments noted the continuing failures to address the Program's impacts

9 and the continued insufficiency of the environmental analysis. Comments also noted the Board's

10 failure to adequately respond to comments that had been submitted on the draft EIR.

11 27. Comments, including from Petitioners, noted the failure to account for plant community

12 extirpation due to projected climate change impacts and how the cumulative impact of their treatments

13 will accelerate those impacts. They also noted the contradiction between the Board's assertion that

14 is chaparral is suffering from too much fire and Program's targeting of chaparral areas for "ecological

15 restoration" via prescribed burning or other habitat clearance techniques. Comments also noted the

16 Board's failure to recognize that although "fuel" treatments can provide help during fire suppression of

17 non-wind-driven fire events, they consistently fail when it matters most - during the wind-driven wildfires

18 that cause all the devastation since all of the most devastating fires in California have been wind-driven.

19 28. Comments noted that Petitioner and others had been addressing these concerns with the Board

20 and others since at least 2005.

21 29. On December 11, 2019, the Board met to consider the Program and the EIR. Testimony in

22 opposition, including from Petitioner, was received regarding numerous concerns. The Board voted to

23 continue the hearing.

24 30. On December 30, 2019, the Board voted to approve the Program and EIR.

25 31. Approvals included: Resolution No. 2019-01, certifying the FEIR and Resolution No. 2019-

26 02, approving the Program, adopting mitigation measures and a Mitigation, Monitoring and Reporting

27 Program, and adopting CEQA Findings and a Statement of Overriding Considerations.

28 32. A Notice of Determination was filed on December 30, 2019.

California Chaparral Institute v. Board of Forestry and Fire Protection Writ Petition Page 6

EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

2 AND INADEQUATE REMEDIES AT LAW

3 33. Petitioners exhausted all available administrative remedies, and objections to the Project
4 have been presented orally and in writing to the Board, as required by Public Resources Code Section
21177. These include, but are not limited to, letters and oral comments presented during public

6 hearings.

7 34. Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code Section

8 21167.5 by mailing a written notice of commencement of this action to the Board. A true and correct

9 copy of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

10 35. Petitioners have advised the Board that Petitioners have elected to prepare the record of
11 proceedings relevant to the approval of the Program, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section
12 21167.6. A true and correct copy of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.

13 36. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code Section 21167.7 by filing a copy of
14 the original petition with the California Attorney General. A true and correct copy of the notification
15 is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.

16 37. Petitioners have no adequate remedy at law unless the Court grants the requested writ of
17 mandate requiring the Board to set aside its approval of the Program and the EIR. In the absence of
18 such remedy, the Board's approvals will remain in effect in violation of State law, and Petitioners will

19 suffer irreparable harm because of the significant adverse environmental impacts generated by the

20 Program.
