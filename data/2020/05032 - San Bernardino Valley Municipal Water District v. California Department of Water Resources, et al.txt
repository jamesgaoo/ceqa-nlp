VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

INTRODUCTION

2 1. In 1960, the State of California, acting through its Department of Water Resources

3 ("DWR"), embarked on developing the largest state-run water project in the United States. The
State Water Project ("SWP") collects water in Lake Orovillel in Northern California and conveys
that water through the Feather and Sacramento Rivers to the Sacramento/San Joaquin River Delta
("Delta"). A pumping plant located in the southern portion of the Delta then pumps that water

7 into the California Aqueduct for delivery to the Bay Area, Kern County, the Central Coast region,

8 and Southern California.

9 2. Local water districts, like Petitioner and Plaintiff San Bernardino Valley Municipal
10 Water District (*Valley District") quickly entered into contracts with DWR to defray the costs of
11 constructing and operating the SWP. The basic premise was simple: DWR would do its best to
d'TI ANVUE AINMOC 12 deliver as much water as possible (up to each contractor's entitlement) and each contractor would
13 pay for that water.

14 3. This case involves a decision by DWR to abdicate its responsibility and obligation
15 to provide water for about two-thirds of California's population and more than 750,000 acres of
16 irrigated farmland. Acting in coordination with the California Department of Fish & Wildlife
17| ("CDFW"), DWR ignored its own analysis of the impacts on the environment from the long-term
18 operations plan for the SWP (the "Project") pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act
19 ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code §§21000 et seq. That analysis showed that the long-term
20 operations of the SWP would not have an adverse impact on the environment. Regardless, DWR
21 agreed in the Final Environmental Impact Report (*Final EIR") for the long-term operations plan
22 that it would reduce deliveries to its contractors by up to as much as 220,000 acre-feet/year
23 ("afy"). DWR never disclosed to the public that it was making this set of changes until it
24  circulated the Final EIR for review. Indeed, the final description of the "project" to be
25

26 An acre-foot of water is commonly understood to be sufficient to provide enough water for
27 five people for a full year. Thus, the quantity of water at issue in this case would be sufficient to meet all of the water needs for a city of 1.25 million people (a city the size of Berkeley) or to 28 irrigate more than 80,000 acres of farmland.

2 1639068v1
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

implemented by DWR is, even after approval of the Project, still unclear.

2 4. In parallel with the environmental review process under CEQA, DWR applied to

3 CDFW for an incidental take permit ("ITP") under the California Endangered Species Act
4 ("CESA"), Fish & Game Code §§2050 et seq. Under the terms of CESA, both CDFW and DWR
are required to use the best available information to ensure that the environment is protected while
also protecting California's economy. Without good scientific basis and without public notice, as

7 mentioned above, DWR submitted to CDFW a permit application that differed quite significantly
8 from the project that was being analyzed under CEQA. CDFW issued the requested permit on

9 March 27, 2020 and imposed a number of additional permit terms that lacked any scientific basis
10 and/or are without precedent. Most notable among those new permit terms is provision that - in
11 effect - allows CDFW to operate the SWP.

5. J'TI UNVIE AHNMOG 12 By acting in these ways, CDFW and DWR have violated the provisions of CEQA
13 and CESA. In addition, DWR has violated the clear terms of its contract with Valley District for
14 the delivery of SWP water ("SWP Contract"), which require DWR to act in good faith to
15 maximize the delivery of water to Valley District. Finally, by imposing conditions that deprive
16 Valley District of water to which it has right, CDFW and DWR have taken that property without
17 just compensation, in violation of the United States and California Constitutions.

PARTIES 18

19 6. Valley District was formed in 1954 under the Municipal Water District act of 1911
20 (California Water Code §§71000 et seq.) as a regional agency to plan and secure a long-range
21 water supply for the San Bernardino Valley. Valley District's headquarters are located at 380 E.
22 Vanderbilt Way, San Bernardino, California 92408. Valley District imports water into its service
23 area through its participation in the SWP and, under judicial supervision, is responsible for the
24 management of the groundwater basins within the San Bernardino Valley. Valley District's
25 customers include thirteen retail water agencies in western San Bernardino County and northern
26 Riverside County, which collectively have more than 700,000 business and residential customers.
27 Valley District's 350 square mile service spans the eastern two-thirds of the San Bernardino
28 Valley, the Crafton Hills, and a portion of the Yucaipa Valley and includes the cities and

3 1639068vl
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 communities of San Bernardino, Colton, Loma Linda, Redlands, Rialto, Bloomington, Highland,
2 East Highland, Mentone, Grand Terrace, Yucaipa, and portions of Fontana. Valley District
3 provides wholesale imported water directly to retail suppliers and augments groundwater supplies

4 by spreading imported water to recharge local groundwater basins.

5 7. Respondent, Defendant, and Real Party in Interest CDFW is an agency of the State
6 of California under the California Natural Resources Agency and is responsible for the
7 administration and enforcement of CESA. CDFW's headquarters are located at 1416 9th Street,
8 12th Floor, Sacramento, California 95814. According to its Notice of Determination, dated March
9 27, 2020, acting in its role as a responsible agency under CEQA and in reliance on the faulty Final
10 EIR prepared by DWR, CDFW approved the ITP. On April 1, 2020, the Office of Planning and

11 Research posted CDFW's Notice of Determination for the ITP

12 8. Respondent, Defendant, and Real Party in Interest DWR is an agency of the State d'TI UNVHA AINMOI 13 of California under the California Natural Resources Agency. DWR's headquarters are also
14 located at 1416 9th Street, Sacramento, California 95814. DWR owns, operates and maintains the
15 SWP, which is the nation's largest state-built, multi-purpose, user-financed water project. DWR is
16 the CEQA lead agency for analyzing, approving and implementing the long-term operations of the
17 SWP. On March 27, 2020, DWR approved the modified Alternative 2(b) and certified the Final
18 EIR. On March 30, 2020, the Office of Planning and Research posted DWR's Notice of
19 Determination regarding its March 27th project approval and Final EIR certification.
20 9. Valley District does not know the true names and capacities, whether individual,

21 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of Respondents and Defendants DOES 1 through 50, inclusive,
22 and therefore sue those Respondents and Defendants under fictitious names. Each of the

23 Respondents and Defendants is the agent, consultant and/or employee of Respondents DWR and
24 CDFW, or otherwise cooperated with DWR and CDFW in the preparation of the Draft and/or
25 Final EIR and/or the ITP and each performed acts on which this action is based within the course
26 and scope of such party's agency and/or employment, or in cooperation with either DWR or
27 CDFW. Valley District will amend this Petition to show the true names and capacities when those
28 names and capacities have been ascertained.

4 1639068v1
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

P JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 10. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to Public Resources Code

3 sections 21167(a), 21168, and 21168.5, and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1060, 1085, and

4 1094.5.

5 11. Venue is proper in this Court under Code of Civil Procedure sections 401,
6 subdivision (1) and 395 because DWR and CDFW have their principal places of business and

7 legal residence in the County of Sacramento, and more specifically because the California
8 Attorney General has an office in the County of Fresno. (See Harris v. Alcoholic Beverage

9 Control Appeals Board (1961) 197 Cal.App.2d 759, 770-771.)

10 STANDING

11 12. a Valley District has a beneficial interest in the subject matter of this proceeding

DOWNEY BRAND LLP 12 because Valley District's water supplies and right to water under the SWP Contract will be
13 directly and adversely affected by CDFW's issuance of the flawed ITP, both as to its substance in
14 failing to comply with the requirements of CESA and based on the ITP's failure to conform to the
15 requirements of CEQA. Further, Valley District's water supplies and right to water under the
16 SWP Contract will be directly and adversely affected by DWR's actions in certifying the legally
17 inadequate Final EIR and approval of the long-term operations plan for the SWP. Valley District
18 has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law for these actions by
19 CDFW and DWR. Valley District will suffer irreparable harm if the ITP is implemented and/or if
20 DWR implements its long-term operations plan for the SWP.

21 13. Valley District has a direct and beneficial interest in CDFW's and DWR's legally
22 adequate compliance with the CESA and CEQA, and all other applicable laws in approving and
23 implementing the SWP long-term operations plan and the ITP. Valley District, as a member of
24 the State Water Contractors, submitted multiple timely objections on CESA, CEQA and other
25 grounds to CDFW and DWR.

26 14. The adverse environmental impacts of DWR's and CDFW's actions will directly
27 and substantially affect Valley District as it seeks to promote and enforce the purposes of CESA
28 and CEQA, the purposes of which are defeated by those agencies' approvals. The ITP approval is

1639068v1 5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 based on an unlawful application of CESA that will result in water supply costs and mitigation
2 that exceed what is legally required to minimize and fully mitigate the impacts of the incidental
3 "take" of CESA-listed species resulting from SWP operations (i.e. under the ITP). The CEQA

4 mitigation is in excess of what is legally required to avoid potential significant environmental
5 impacts, as the project has no significant environmental effects. Moreover, the approvals were

6 made without compliance with CEQA's informational and public participation objectives.
7 Determining the true facts about the project's environmental impacts and disclosing those facts to
8 decision-makers and the public are within the core statutory intent of CEQA to promote fully
9 informed public participation and decision making.

10 15. CDFW has a mandatory and public duty to comply with the CESA, CEQA, and all

DOWNEY BRAND LLP 11 other applicable laws, when relying on the Final EIR as a responsible agency and issuing the ITP.
12 DWR has a mandatory and public duty to comply with CEQA and all other applicable laws when
13 certifying the Final EIR and approving and implementing the long-term operations plan for the
14 SWP. DWR also has an obligation to comply with its contract with Valley District in its all its
15 activities, including permitting. In addition, the issues in this action under CESA and CEQA are
16 issues of public right and Valley District brings this action in the public interest and on behalf of
17| its ratepayers to enforce CDFW's and DWR's public duties.

18

19 16. EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES AND NOTICE

Valley District has performed or is excused from performing any and all conditions
20 precedent to filing this action. Valley District is a member of the State Water Contractors
21 ("SWC"), a non-profit mutual-benefit corporation representing the common interests of twenty-
22 seven water supply agencies that contract with the State of California for water from the SWP.
23 Valley District fully exhausted any administrative remedies by and through the SWC's objections
24 to the changing and undisclosed final project description; failure to analyze the alternatives; and
25 failure to recirculate the EIR after substantial new information was added. Those objections were
26 submitted not only by the SWC for itself but also on behalf of its member agencies, including
27 Valley District. The facts relevant to these claims continued to evolve continually up to the

28 approval of the CESA incidental take permit, certification of the Final EIR, and approval of the

1639068vl 6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 long-term operation plan. Valley District, and/or other agencies, organizations, and individuals

2 also raised legal deficiencies asserted in this Petition and Complaint. Furthermore, the extensive

3 new information that was not publicly disclosed and which formed the basis of the Final EIR, and
4 the incidental take permit which was never made public prior to its approval, deprived the public

5 of the ability to exhaust their administrative remedies with specificity.

6 17. Valley District has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by
7 providing DWR and CDFW notice of intent to commence this action. The notice is attached

8 hereto as Exhibit A.

9 18. In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.7, Valley District has
10 concurrently provided a copy of this Petition to the California Attorney General. The notice is
11 attached hereto as Exhibit B.

I'TT ANVAE AHNMOU 12 19. Service of this Petition on CDFW and DWR satisfies any applicable service
13 requirements under Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5, subdivisions (a), (b), and (c).

14 20. In accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2),
15 Valley District has attached and is hereby filing a notice of its election to prepare the
16 administrative record as Exhibit C.

17 TIMELINESS AND REQUEST FOR CEQA HEARING

18 21. This lawsuit has been commenced within the time limits imposed for this action
19 under Code of Civil Procedure sections 312, 319, 337(a), 343; Public Resources Code sections
20 21167, 21168 and 21168.5; and California Rules of Court, Emergency Rule 9.

21 22. Valley District requests a hearing on this Petition and Complaint pursuant to Public
22 Resources Code section 21167.4.

23 ATTORNEYS' FEES

24 23. In seeking to compel Respondents to lawfully discharge their mandatory public
25 duties, Petitioner is acting in its capacity as private attorneys general in the interest and for the
26 benefit of the public pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable
27 legal theory, to enforce important rights affecting the public interest. Issuance of the relief
28 requested in this Petition will constitute a significant public benefit by requiring Respondents to

7 1639068vl
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

carry out their duties as lead and responsible agencies under CEQA in compliance with the law.

24. Further, Petitioner brings this action on the basis, among other things, that
Respondents' actions in connection with the Project and ITP were and continue to be arbitrary and

4 capricious. Pursuant to Government Code section 800 and other applicable laws, Petitioner is

5 entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees for bringing this action to redress Respondents' arbitrary and
6 capricious actions in connection with the Project.

25. Valley District has incurred and will continue to incur attorneys' and experts' fees,
8 and other costs and expenses due to this proceeding in amounts not yet ascertained, and which
amounts are recoverable in this action under all applicable provisions of law, including Code of
10 Civil Procedure sections 1021.5 and 1036 and Government Code section 800.

11 INADEQUATE REMEDY AT LAW - STAY AND INJUNCTION

12 26. Under Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 1085, and 1094.5 and Public d'TI ANVHE AINMOI 13 Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5, the Court may stay or enjoin operation of any
14 administrative decision or order involved in this proceeding

15 27. Because Respondents, as lead and responsible agencies under CEQA, have
16 approved the Project and ITP, there is a real threat that Respondents will proceed to implement the
17 Project and ITP despite inadequate environmental review of the impacts of those actions. Given
18 Respondents' violations of CEQA by certifying the EIR and approving the Project and issuing the
19 ITP in reliance on that unlawfully certified EIR, any action to implement the Project and ITP is

20 null and void. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law for the irreparable harm
21 that would result from Respondents' implementation of the Project and ITP. A stay or preliminary
22 or permanent injunction is necessary to restrain DWR and CDFW from taking additional actions
23 to implement the Project and ITP until Respondents have complied with CEQA.

24 28. A stay or injunction of Respondents' actions relating to the Project and ITP would
25 not be against the public interest because DWR and CDFW are required to conduct adequate
26 environmental review of the Project and ITP prior to approval, because operation of the Project
27 and reliance on the ITP would likely have significant impacts on the environment, and because
28 Respondents will not be harmed by a stay or injunction.

2 BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

3 State Water Project

29.

4 The SWP is the foundation of California's water storage and delivery system. It

5 provides drinking water for more than 27 million Californians and over 750,000 acres of farmland.

30. The SWP includes 34 storage facilities, reservoirs and lakes; 20 pumping plants;
6 pumping-generating plants; 5 hydroelectric power plants; and about 700 miles of open canals and
7 pipelines.

8 31.

9 Construction of the SWP was authorized by approval of the Burns-Porter Act
(Proposition One) on the November 1960 state ballot. Construction on the SWP began in 1957,
10 prior to the passage of the Burns-Porter Act. The first deliveries to the Bay Area were made in

11

DOWNEY BRAND LLP 1962. In 1973, the pumps and the East and West branches of the California Aqueduct were
12 completed and the first water was delivered to Southern California.

13

14 SWP Operations

32. The SWP operates in coordination with the federal Central Valley Project ("CVP")
15 operated by the United States Bureau of Reclamation under the Coordinated Operations
16 Agreement between the federal government and the State of California (authorized by Pub. L. 99-
17 546). The Coordinated Operations Agreement governs how the SWP and CVP exercise their
18 respective water rights and operate together to meet specific water quality and outflow
19 requirements in the Delta. It is based on principles of equitable sharing arising from requirements
20 that their operations be coordinated, and as a matter of practical necessity, the two projects operate
21 together in a complex tidal estuary.

22 33.

23 The SWP and CVP are regulated by a web of state and federal laws, including state
and federal water quality statutes, Army Corps of Engineers permits and federal Endangered
24 Species Act biological opinions. These layers of concurrent state and federal regulations cover
25 every month of the year.

26 34. The Coordinated Operations Agreement provides the federal nexus that facilitates
27 the SWP's federal Endangered Species Act coverage under the same biological opinions as the
28 CVP.

1639068vl 9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

35. The SWP and CVP operate pursuant to water rights permits and licenses issued by

2 the State Water Resources Control Board. The separate water rights of the SWP and CVP allow
3 appropriation of water by directly using the water, diverting water to storage for later withdrawal,
and rediverting the water to storage further downstream for later consumptive use. Operating to
the respective water right requirements of the SWP and CVP results in either bypass flows or
6 withdrawal of water from storage to help satisfy specific water quality and operational criteria.

7 Consultation History for ESA and CESA Coverage

8 36. The SWP must have both CESA and federal Endangered Species Act coverage.

9 During the permitting process at issue, DWR took an unprecedented approach to concurrently seek
10 separate state and federal permits, complying with the federal Endangered Species Act and CESA,
11 according to the timeline provided below:

J'TI UNVIE AINMOC 12 August 2016: DWR and Reclamation request reinitiation of consultation for BiOps for the
13 coordinated long-term operation plan.

14 January 2019: Reclamation submits initial biological assessment for coordinated long-
15 term operation plan for the SWP and CVP.

16 July 2019: Reclamation releases for public comment its draft environmental impact
17 statement for the coordinated long-term operation plan.

18 October 2019: Reclamation releases the final biological assessment.
19 October 2019: The United State Fish and Wildlife and the National Marine Fisheries

20 Service sign the final biological opinions.

21 November 2019: DWR releases for public review and comment its draft environmental

22 impact report for CESA permit for the long-term operation of the SWP. The proposed
23 project is consistent with 2019 federal biological opinions.

24 December 2019: DWR submits application for an incidental take permit pursuant to
25 CESA. The proposed project, which is not the project that was described in the Draft EIR,

26 is inconsistent with 2019 federal biological opinions.
27 December 2019: Reclamation releases the final environmental impact statement for the
28 coordinated long-term operation plan for the SWP and CVP.

10 1639068vl
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 February 2020: Reclamation signs the Record of Decision.

2

3 March 2020: DWR releases Final EIR and signs the Notice of Determination adopting

4 modified Alternative 2(b), an alternative that had never previously been disclosed.

5 March 2020: CDFW issues CESA incidental take permit and findings for a project that
has not previously been disclosed.

6 37.

7 This consultation process of receiving both federal and state permits under two

8 different endangered species acts is complicated by the fact that there are species that are listed

9 under state law only, federal law only, and those that are dual listed. The table below describes

this.

10 Dual listed Federal ESA listed only

11 CESA listed only

Delta smelt Central Valley
12 Winter-run Chinook Longfin smelt

DOWNEY BRAND LLP steelhead

13 salmon Green sturgeon
14 Spring-run Chinook Southern resident

15 salmon killer whale

16

17 38. More than a decade ago, in 2008 and 2009, respectively, the United States Fish and
18 Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service issued biological opinions permitting
19 the coordinated operations of the SWP and CVP for federally listed species. Beginning in 2009,
20 CDFW issued consistency determinations, which is allowed under state law based on CDFW
21 conclusions that operating to the federal biological opinions would also comply with CESA for the
22 dual-listed species. Also in 2009, CDFW issued a Fish and Game Code section 2081 permit to
23 authorize incidental take of Longfin smelt, a state-only listed species for which a consistency
24 determination was not a permitting option. This state and federal permitting structure existed for
25 about a decade, with all species covered by the same operational rules, except Longfin smelt.
26 However, even operational parameters required for the protection of Longfin smelt under the
27 separate Fish and Game Code section 2081 permit were largely consistent with the state and
28 federal permitting structure, being partially reliant on operational requirements for the protection

1639068v1 11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

of Delta smelt, a state and federally listed species.

2 39. This consistency in state and federal permits for the coordinated operation of the
CVP and SWP ended in March 2020 when DWR approved a SWP long-term operations plan that

4 was dramatically different than the jointly proposed DWR-Reclamation long term operation plan
permitted by the United State Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries
Service, and when a the CDFW signed a Fish and Game Code section 2081 permit for all dual listed
and state-only species (winter-run Chinook salmon, spring-run Chinook salmon, Delta smelt and
8 Longfin smelt) that was dramatically different than the SWP long term operations plan initially

9 proposed by DWR.

10 SWP CESA Permit

11 40. The 2020 CESA incidental take permit covers the operation of the SWP in the
d'TI INVHE AINMOG 12 Delta. The SWP facilities covered by the incidental take permit are the Harvey O. Bank Pumping
13 Plant, John E. Skinner Delta Fish Protective Facility, Clifton Court Forebay, Barker Slough
14 Pumping Plant, Suisun Marsh Operations, south Delta temporary barrier project, and the SWP
15 share of San Luis Reservoir. The Delta facilities are depicted in Figure 3-1 of DWR's Final EIR,
16 titled Locations of State Water Project Facilities in the Delta, Suisun Marsh, and Suisun Bay.

17 41. The facilities or activities not included in the incidental take permit include flood
18 control; CVP facilities, operations, and agreements; and Oroville Dam and Feather River
19 operations, as these are covered by separate permits. The CESA incidental take permit purports to
20 cover an area that includes existing storage and export facilities located in the Delta and vicinity,
21 generally being downstream from Oroville Reservoir on the Feather River to the confluence with
22 the Sacramento River, and downstream to the Delta.

23 42. As stated in DWR's incidental take permit application, the project's objective is "to
24 continue the long-term operation of the SWP consistent with applicable laws, contractual
25 obligations, and agreements. DWR proposes to store, divert, and convey water in accordance with
26 DWR's existing water rights to deliver water pursuant to water contracts and agreements up to full
27 contract quantities."

28 43. The CESA permit authorizes incidental take of Longfin smelt (state-listed

1 threatened), Delta smelt (state-listed endangered), spring-run Chinook salmon ESU (state-listed
2 threatened), and winter-run Chinook salmon ESA (state-listed endangered).

4 44. DWR's and CDFW's CEQA and CESA Process
On April 19, 2019, DWR distributed a Notice of Preparation of the Draft EIR for
5 its SWP long-term operations plan. DWR held public scoping meetings regarding the Draft EIR
6 on May 6 and May 13, 2019.

7 45.

8 DWR prepared an Initial Study for the SWP long-term operations plan, DWR

9 determined that the SWP long-term operations plan would not have a significant impact on the
following resource topics: aesthetics, agriculture/forestry, air quality, biological resources
10 (terrestrial), cultural resources, energy, geology/soils, greenhouse gas emissions,

DOWNEY BRAND LLP 11 hazards/hazardous materials, surface water hydrology, land use/planning, mineral resources, noise,
12 population/housing, public services, recreation and transportation/traffic. The Initial Study
13 concluded that the long-term operations plan would not result in significant impacts on hydrology
14 or surface water resources. But because implementation of the long-term operations plan would
15 alter existing hydrology, these alterations could potentially result in impacts on resources
16 dependent on existing hydrologic conditions, including water quality and aquatic biological
17 resources. Because of these potentially significant impacts, DWR decided to prepare an
18 environmental impact report.

19 46. In November 2019, DWR released its Draft EIR for public comment, identifying a
20 proposed project, which was consistent with the project that the federal fish agenciesthe Fish
21 and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service--permitted in the biological
22 opinions dated October 2019. DWR determined that the proposed project would have no
23 potentially significant environmental impacts. Nevertheless, DWR added four alternatives
24 (Alternative 2(a), 2(b), Alternative 3 and Alternative 4) to the Draft EIR. The potential effects
25 were estimated by comparing cach alternative to the No Action and the proposed project without
26 fully modeling each alternative. The full range of impacts for these alternatives were not disclosed
27 in the Draft EIR.

47.

2 | Sacramento. DWR held a public meeting on its Draft EIR on December 12, 2019 in West

3 48. In December 2019, DWR submitted its application for an incidental take permit to

5 CDFW. The incidental take permit application identified a project that was different than the
proposed project contained in the Draft EIR and different than the project authorized in the
6 biological opinions. In the application, DWR concluded that the project satisfied CESA
7 requirements.

8 49.

9 Even though DWR concluded that the original proposed project in the Draft EIR
had no significant and unavoidable environmental impacts, DWR added new mitigation in the
10 form of new spring and summer outflow to the proposed project in its application for an incidental

DOWNEY BRAND LLP 11  take permit. These new operational requirements and mitigation exceed what is required to
12 comply with CESA and CEQA. In particular, DWR, and its parent agency the California Natural
13 Resources Agency, committed to a policy to not increase exports from the Delta, ignoring its own
14 analysis that showed that restriction on exports was not necessary to meet the requirements of
15 CEQA and CESA.

16 50. DWR's public comment period for its Draft EIR ended January 6, 2020. DWR
17 received over 60 letters from the public regarding the Draft EIR, including SWC's January 6, 2020
18 comment letter. In this comment, letter, SWC, on behalf of its members, including Valley
19 District, noted that the project proposed in the CESA application differed materially from the
20 project analyzed in the Draft EIR.

21 51. The Final EIR was issued and the Notice of Determination was signed on March
22 27, 2020. DWR's March 2020 Final EIR and notice of determination approved a project that was
23 different than any of the project alternatives contained in the November 2019 public Draft EIR, the
24 CESA application, and the SWP's new federal 2019 biological opinions for ESA coverage.
25 52. Even though DWR concluded that the project described in its application for an
26 incidental take permit fully complies with CESA, DWR added substantial new operational
27 restrictions and mitigation to modified Alternative 2(b). These new operational requirements and
28 mitigation exceed what is required to comply with CESA and CEQA.

1639068vl 14
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 53. The Final EIR includes new modeling and analysis, and a new previously
2 undisclosed modified Alternative 2(b) that DWR approved with no opportunity for public review
3 and comment prior to certifying the Final EIR, approving the modified project and signing the
4 notice of determination. The previously undisclosed components of the modified Alternative 2(b)

5 include, but are not limited to:

6 new dry-year operation of Suisun Marsh Salinity Control Gate;

7 • new spring-run Chinook salmon daily-loss trigger for an export reduction;

8 new winter-run Chinook salmon daily-loss trigger for an export reduction;

9 new November and December export reduction for winter-run Chinook salmon;
10 new salinity target of 4 ppt at Belden's Landing in Suisun Marsh; and
11 new authority for CDFW to control real-time operations of the SWP to benefit larval Delta

d'TI ONVHA AHNMOG 12 smelt between an operational range of -5,000 to -1,250 cfs flow in Old and Middle River.

13 54. The components of modified Alternative 2(b) that were never modeled or analyzed,
14 and therefore not disclosed to the public or decision-makers include, but are not limited to:

15 • deferral of up to 150,000 acre-feet of spring outflow and 100,000 acre-feet of summer
16 outflow to subsequent years, including the use of Oroville storage;

17 implementation of daily winter-run Chinook salmon loss trigger for export reduction;

18 daily spring-run Chinook salmon loss trigger;

19 larval Delta smelt operations between - 1,250 and -5,000 cfs Old and Middle River flow;

20 November and December winter-run Chinook salmon loss triggers for export reductions;
21 and

22 new salinity target of 4 ppt at Belden's Landing in Suisun Marsh.

23 55. Although incomplete, the Final EIR includes significant new modeling and analysis
24 that was never provided to the public for review and comment. The final impact report also
25  includes two brand new technical appendices (J and K); substantial revisions to four other
26 technical appendices (C, E, F, and H); and a dozen new technical reports and modeling
27 outcomes-containing significant new information that was never circulated for public review.

28 56. The Final EIR does not disclose or analyze the potential impacts of reduction in

1639068vt 15
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 exports under modified Alternative 2(b) on the ability of SWP contractors to use SWP water to
2 recharge groundwater basins.

3 57. The exact project for which DWR sought an incidental take permit is unknowable.
4 The application for an incidental take permit was never amended, yet CDFW relied on modeling

5 for Alternative 2(b) that was not presented in the application or the Draft EIR, and never provided

6 to the public for review and comment. Many other new project components were later added to

7 modified Alternative 2(b) in the Final EIR and CESA incidental take permit that had never been
8 previously disclosed, analyzed, or circulated for public comment prior to finalization of the permit.

9 58. The incidental take permit is dated March 31, 2020. The incidental take permit
10 describes a project that is different than any of the alternatives contained in the November 2019
11 public Draft EIR, the CESA permit application, the Final EIR, and the SWP's federal ESA

d'TI UNVAE AENMOG 12 coverage in the biological opinions. The previously undisclosed components of the permit that
13 were never analyzed in any environmental impact report, include, but are not limited to new limits
14 on export operations for Longfin smelt, and a new Delta Smelt salvage calculation and limit on
15 exports. The permit also adds an additional estimated $179 million dollars in new nonflow
16 obligations.

17 59. Even though DWR concluded in the Draft EIR that the proposed project and
18 Alternative 2(b) had no significant impacts, and even though DWR concluded that the project
19 described in its permit application complied with CESA, CDFW imposed substantial new and
20 previously undisclosed operational limits and mitigation. These new project obligations are
21 substantial, meaning they are out of proportion with the minimal effects shown in the underlying
22 analysis.

23 60. The incidental take permit imposes obligations that are out of proportion with, and
24 in some cases unrelated to, the effects of the SWP, and are in excess of the fully mitigate standard.
25 (Fish and Game Code, § 2018(b)(2) ["the measures required to meet this obligation shall be
26 roughly proportional in extent to the impacts of the authorized taking on the species"]; Cal Code
27 of Regs, tit. 14, § 15126.4.) As DWR explained in its Response to Comments: "Under CESA, a
28 project applicant is only responsible for mitigating the impacts that would be caused by activities

16 1639068vl
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 proposed by the applicant, as opposed to impacts caused by others," and, "DWR does not control
2 CVP operations." Yet, the CESA incidental take permit includes requirements that the SWP
3 reduce exports when Delta smelt are entrained in the federal CVP facilities. The permit also
4 requires the SWP to mitigate for the effects of upstream federal CVP reservoirs operated by
5 Reclamation.

6 61. CDFW's changes to the project and imposition of unjustified additional mitigation
7 measures presents complicated operational issues. To achieve compliance and enjoy protection
8 under both the federal Endangered Species is Act and CESA, DWR is required to comply with the
9 conditions in both the federal biological opinions as well as the state incidental take permit.
10 Nonetheless, CDFW stated that if there were any inconsistencies between the federal endangered
11 species act permit and the state incidental take permit, the state permit is controlling. (See CDFW

d'TT ANVHA AHNMOG 12 incidental take permit, Condition of Approval #3 [*For purposes of this ITP, where the terms and
13 conditions in the federal authorization are less protective of the Covered Species or otherwise
14 conflict with this ITP, the conditions of approval set forth in this ITP shall control"].) CDFW's
15 permit is inconsistent with law as the SWP must comply with both federal and state law.

16 62. CDFW is required to utilize the best available scientific information. But it did not,
17 often ignoring the statistical and scientific uncertainty associated with the analyses it relied it on.
18 63. The incidental take permit and CDFW's findings fail to identify the exact nature
19 and magnitude of incidental take associated with the SWP, and then fail to link that SWP-specific
20 take to minimization measures and measures required to fully mitigate the impacts of the
21 authorized incidental take. The result is the imposition of obligations on the SWP that violate
22 legal standards.

23 The SWP Water Supply Contract Between Valley District and DWR

24 64. DWR has entered into long-term water supply contracts with twenty-nine water
25 agencies for the delivery of SWP water. The water delivery contracts cover both agricultural use
26 and municipal and industrial use. Each contract includes an entitlement to a maximum annual
27 amount of water to be made available for delivery by DWR, as set forth in Table A of each
28 respective contract. The combined total annual amount of Table A water entitlements is

17 1639068v1
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 approximately 4.2 million acre-feet/year. The actual amount of water allocated to SWP

2 contractors is determined based on forecasts of future hydrological conditions to estimate the

3 availability of SWP supplies to satisfy the SWP contracts. The forecasting process is updated
4 monthly to update the allocations as the water year progresses. DWR carries out this allocation
5 process pursuant to the terms of Article 58 of the SWP contracts.

6 65. Valley District and DWR executed a water supply contract for SWP water on

7 December 30, 1960. The contract established Valley District's ability to participate in SWP water

8 and requirements for the purchase thereof. The contract has since been amended a number of

9 times. The operative amended contract was executed on May 28, 2003 (the "SWP Contract"). A
10 true and correct copy of the SWP Contract is attached hereto as Exhibit D.

11 66. Valley District manages the water received under its SWP Contract to satisfy the

ITI ONVNE AHNMOG 12 water supply demands of its customers, pursuant to state law. Valley District is also responsible,
13 under judicial supervision, for managing the groundwater basins within its boundaries. Valley
14 District transports water from the SWP to its service area to provide water for groundwater
15 recharge, irrigation, and wholesale domestic delivery. Water delivered to Valley District pursuant
16 to the SWP Contract is a significant source of water for Valley District and plays a critical role in
17 Valley District's ability to satisfy the many demands for water within its service area.

18 67. Payments by Valley District under the SWP Contract include both the variable cost
19 for water delivered each year and the amortized cost of Valley District's proportionate share of
20 cost for the SWP infrastructure necessary to deliver water to Valley District.

21 68. Article 6(b) of the SWP Contract provides that DWR will make water available for
22 delivery to Valley District in the amount set forth in Table A of the SWP Contract. Table A
23 provides that Valley District has an annual entitlement of water in the amount of 102,600 afy.

24 69. Article 18 the SWP Contract allows DWR to reduce annual entitlements project-
25 wide on a pro rata basis during a condition of shortage. Article 18(a) provides in part: "In any

26 year in which there may occur a shortage due to drought or any other cause whatsoever, in the
27 supply of project water available for delivery to the contractors, with the result that such supply is
28 less than the total of the annual entitlements of all contractors for that year, the State shall allocate

18 1639068vl
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

the available supply in proportion to each contractor's annual entitlement ... ." (Emphasis in
2 original.)

3 70. Article 18(f), titled "No Liability for Shortages" provides that DWR is not liable
4 for damage arising from "shortages in the amount of water to be made available for delivery to the

5 District under this contract caused by drought, operation of area of origin statutes, or any other
cause beyond its control." (Emphasis added.)

71. Deliveries of Valley District's annual entitlement are also subject to Article 58 of

8 the SWP Contract. Article 58 provides for DWR to issue a report setting forth "the estimates of

9 overall delivery capability of the existing project facilities and of supply availability to each
10 contractor in accordance with other provisions of the contractors' contracts. The range of
11 hydrological conditions shall include the delivery capability in the driest year of record, the

d'TI ANVHE AINMOI 12 average over the historic extended dry cycle and the average over the long-term."
13 72. Although Valley District is not guaranteed to receive its maximum
14 / Table A amounts each year, Article 16(b) of each of the State Water Contracts requires DWR to
15 "make all reasonable efforts to perfect and protect water rights necessary for the System and for
16 the satisfaction of water supply commitments under this contract."

17 73. Furthermore, although DWR has a certain amount of discretion in how it operates
18 and manages the SWP, Article 38 of each of the SWP Contracts requires that DWR do so in a
19 manner that is not "arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable."

20 74. The incidental take permit includes conditions that would require DWR to reduce
21 spring exports by up to 150,000 afy and 100,000 afy in the summer in order to satisfy the ITP's
22 requirements for outflow into the Delta. The ITP acknowledges the possibility of satisfying the
23 reduction in flows pursuant to voluntary agreements between DWR and the state contractors, but
24 such voluntary agreements have not been entered into, and the ITP does not otherwise state the
25 source of the reduced flows.

26 75. The conditions in the ITP were imposed by CDFW based on DWR's application
27 for CESA compliance for the Project. The conditions are subject to CDFW enforcement and are

28 to be implemented by DWR.

19 1639068v1
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

76. On information and belief, Valley District alleges that DWR has accepted the terms

2 of the ITP and will satisfy the conditions to reduce exports by up 220,000 afy by imposing
3 reductions among SWP contractors on a pro rata basis. Valley District estimates that it will lose
4 approximately 6,000 afy as a result of such reductions in exports.
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

6 (Petition for Writ of Mandate Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1085 and 1094.5-Violation of

7 the California Endangered Species Act)

8 (Against Respondent CDFW and DOES 1-50)

9 77. Valley District incorporates herein by reference each previous paragraph of this
10 Petition and Complaint as though set forth here in full.

11 78. All "persons," including state agencies such as DWR, are prohibited from taking a

LLP 12 threatened or endangered species unless authorized under an incidental take permit. (Fish & Game
13 Code, §§ 2080, 2081; Kern County Water Agency v. Watershed Enforcers (2010) 185 Cal. App.
VIE AHNMOI 14 4th 969, 980-981.) In adopting CESA, the Legislature also intended that mitigation to address
15 particular impacts on a species "shall a be roughly proportional in extent to the impact of the
16 authorized taking on the species," "shall maintain the [project] applicant's objectives to the
17 greatest extent possible," and "shall be capable of successful implementation." (Fish & Game
18 Code, § 2081.)

19 79. CDFW's actions constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion because it failed to
20 proceed in a manner required by law. The defects in the incidental take permit are pervasive and
21 fundamental. CDFW prejudicially abused its discretion by: (1) imposing conditions in the
22 incidental take permit that violate CESA; (2) issuing a decision unsupported by the Director's
23 factual findings; and (3) making factual findings not supported by the evidence. (Environmental
24 Protection Information Center v. California Dept. of Forestry & Fire Protection (2008) 44 Cal.
25 4th 459, 478). The incidental take permit's defects and CDFW's violations of CESA include, but

26 are not limited to the following:

27 Improper Definition of Take

28 80. Under the Fish & Game Code, "take" "means hunt, pursue, catch, or kill, or attempt

1639068v1 20
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 to hunt, pursue, catch, capture or kill." (Fish & Game Code, § 86.) Habitat is not within the

2 definition of "take." (Environmental Council of Sacramento v. City of Sacramento, 142

3 Cal.App. 4th 1018, 1040 (2006) ["We reject any insinuation that the definition of 'take' under Fish
and Game Code section 2081 subdivision (b)(2) encompasses habitat alone"]; 94 Ops. Cal. Atty.

5 Gen, 605 [concluding "State law does not prohibit indirect harm to a state-listed endangered

6 species or threated species by way of habitat modification"].)

7 81. CDFW attempts to characterize habitat modification as "impacts of the authorized

8 take" that must be fully mitigated under Fish & Game Code 8 2081 and Cal. Code. Regs., tit. 14 §

9 783.4(a)(2). For example, the incidental take permit states at page 44: "Impacts of the authorized
10 taking also include adverse impacts to covered species related to temporal losses, increased habitat
11 fragmentation, reduction in habitat extent and quality, and increased edge effects and the Project's

ITI UNVAE AHNMOG 12 incremental contribution to cumulative impacts (indirect effects)."

13 82. Similarly, in the CESA Findings CDFW asserts that project-related disturbance of
14 covered species habitat are expected to result in incidental take of those species and that "adverse
15  changes to habitat characteristics that certain covered species rely on, is an appropriate and
16 necessary indicator of the extent of incidental take at issue." (CESA Findings at pp. 6-7.) A plain
17 reading of the ITP and the related California Endangered Species Act Findings demonstrates that
18 the agency is improperly using habitat modification as a proxy for species mortality. This runs
19 afoul of CESA by impermissibly considering habitat modification itself to be a taking.

20 Permit Conditions Inconsistent with Project Objectives
21 83. Under CESA, CDFW "shall maintain the applicant's objectives to the greatest
22 extent possible" when selecting among mitigation measures. (Fish & Game Code, § 2081(b)(2).)

23 84. DWR explains in its incidental take permit application that "[t]he objective of the
24 Proposed Project is to continue the long-term operation of the SWP consistent with applicable
25 laws, contractual obligations, and agreements. DWR proposes to store, divert, and convey water

26 in accordance with DWR's existing water rights to deliver water pursuant to water contracts and
27 agreements up to full contract quantities. DWR seeks to optimize water supply and improve
28 operational flexibility while protecting fish and wildlife based on the best available scientific

21 1639068v1
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

information." (CESA Application at p. 3-1; see also Draft EIR § 3.1.1.)

2 85. CDFW makes a conclusory finding that required mitigation in the ITP maintains

3 the project's objectives to the greatest extent possible but provides no analysis to support that
4 statement. (CESA Findings at p. 43.) Review of the ITP shows that CDFW did not maintain the
5 project's objectives. For example, Valley District is informed and believes that CDFW intended
6 to ensure no additional SWP exports from the Delta would be allowed under the ITP. which is
7 fundamentally inconsistent with the stated project objectives in the Draft EIR and CESA
8 application. Conditions in the ITP, including but not limited to, conditions requiring additional

9 export flow restrictions not tied to any anticipated incidental take, results in the imposition of
10 mitigation that does not maintain the project's objective of optimizing water supply and is not
11  based on the best available science.

Disproportionate Mitigation d'TI (NVHE DOWNEY 12

13 86. CESA dictates that all measures required to minimize and mitigate the impacts of
14 an authorized taking "shall be roughly proportional in extent to the impact of the authorized taking

15 on the species." (Fish & Game Code, § 2081(b)(2).)

16 87. CDFW improperly imposed minimization and mitigation measures that are
17 disproportionate to the alleged impacts of the incidental take authorized under the ITP. For
18 example, DWR explained in its application for an incidental take permit that the long-term
19 operations would minimize and fully mitigate the impacts of incidental take from the SWP.
20 CDFW nonetheless imposed new minimization, mitigation and monitoring requirements in the
21 ITP well above and beyond the conditions in prior authorizationsthese new requirements will
22 cost approximately $179 million and require significant additional SWP export restrictions. These
23 water supply and financial costs are in addition to the approximately $580 million and significant
24 operational limitations that were already incorporated into the project through the federal
25 endangered species act biological opinions and changes DWR made to the project in the Final
26 EIR.

27 88. CDFW fails to tie this mitigation to the alleged SWP impacts on the covered
28 species. For example, the new spring (April-May) outflow obligation maintains the effect the of

22 1639068v1
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 SWP at the same level that CDFW permitted under the prior consistency determinations, yet the

2 ITP requires an additional 396.3 acres to mitigate a change in April-May outflow. Either CDFW

3 is requiring the SWP to mitigate the same effect twice, or it is requiring the SWP to mitigate for

4 the effect of the CVP's change in April-May operations. Either is unlawful. Compounding
5 CDFW's error in failing to explain how the incidental take permit's measures mitigate for alleged
6 impacts from the project, it is evident that much of the mitigation is impermissibly based on

7 impacts caused by other water users. For example, CDFW added new requirements to the permit

8 that require that the SWP reduce exports when Delta smelt are entrained in the federal CVP

9 facilities.

10 Infeasible Mitigation

11 89. CESA dictates that all measures required to minimize and mitigate the impacts of

d'TI UNVHE AHNMOI 12 any authorized taking "shall be capable of successful implementation." (Fish & Game Code, §
13 2081(b)(2).) CDFW issued the ITP with conditions that are not capable of successful
14 implementation, including, but not limited to, conditions that require DWR to prevent other water
15 diverters from diverting the water that the ITP precludes the SWP from diverting.

16 Inadequate CESA Findings

17 90. CDFW's California Endangered Species Act Findings are inadequate and
18 unsupported by substantial evidence. For example, contrary to law, CDFW failed to rely on the
19 best scientific information in making its findings and issuing the ITP. (Fish & Game Code,
20 2081(c).) Instead CDFW relied on conclusory statements and repeatedly failed to acknowledge
21 the scientific uncertainty in its assumptions.

22 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

23 (Petition for Writ of Mandate Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1085 and 1094.5-Violation of
24 the California Environmental Quality Act by Responsible Agency)

25 (Against Respondent CDFW, Real Party in Interest DWR and DOES 1-50)

26 91. Valley District incorporates herein by reference each previous paragraph of this
27 Petition and Complaint as though set forth here in full.
28 92. "[T]he legislature intended [CEQA] to be interpreted in such manner as to afford

23 1639068v1
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory

2 language." (City of San Diego v. Board of Trustees of the California State University (2015) 61

3 Cal.4th 945, 963, internal punctuation and citation omitted.) When complying with CEQA, a
responsible agency must proceed in the manner required by law, and its determinations must be

5 supported by substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5; Cal. Code Regs., tit.14, §

6 15096; River Watch v. Olivenhain Muni. Water Dist. (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1186.)

7 93. CEQA requires a responsible agency to independently consider the information in

8 the EIR prepared by the lead agency and reach its own conclusions on whether and how to

9 approve the project involved. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15096.)

10 94. As the responsible agency, CDFW violated CEQA in ways independent of and in
11 addition to violations by DWR. CDFW approved an operation that was never analyzed in the
d'TI UNVIE AHNMOC 12 Final EIR. The public was never afforded an opportunity to review and comment on the
13 alternative operation and decision makers approved the project without being fully informed as to
14 its impacts. The only analysis that was available to decision makers was contained in the Final
15 EIR. The procedural and substantive defects in the Final EIR are so pervasive and fundamental
16 that informed decision-making and informed public participation were impossible. CDFW's errors
17 as a responsible agency constitute a procedural and substantive violation of CEQA.

18 95. CDFW abused its discretion in numerous ways, including relying on a procedurally
19 and substantively flawed Final EIR; imposing CEQA mitigation for unidentified impacts; adopting
20 misleading and contradictory findings; and approving project that has not yet undergone
21 adequate CEQA review. In doing so, CDFW violated its duties as a responsible agency to
22 independently review and approve the CEQA document for the proposed action and not
23 reflexively rely on the lead agency's judgments. CDFW's CEQA violations include but are not
24 limited to the following.

25 Inconsistent and Unstable Project Description

26 96. A stable and consistent project description is essential to achieving CEQA's
27 mandate. (Washoe Meadows Community v. Department of Parks and Recreation (2017) 17
28 Cal.App.5th 277, 287-288.) As set forth below in greater detail, the Final EIR violates this

24 1639068vl
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 fundamental mandate because the project description evolved throughout the administrative
2 process and neither modified Alternative 2(b) nor the project that CDFW approved in the CESA

3 incidental take permit were analyzed in the Final EIR.

4 97. The project descriptions in the Draft EIR, the incidental take application, Final EIR,
5 and the ITP are all materially different. This inconsistency in describing the project prevented

6 informed public comment and informed decision-making and rendered the Final EIR, CEQA

7 Findings, and CDFW's incidental take permit legally deficient. This is a procedural and
8 substantive violation of CEQA.

9 Failure to Evaluate a Reasonable Range of Alternatives

10 98. When deciding whether to approve a proposed project with significant
11 environmental effects, agencies are required to consider and evaluate a reasonable range of

d'II ONVNE AHNMOC 12 alternatives that offer environmental advantages over the proposed project and that may feasibly
13 be accomplished in a successful manner. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.6(c), (d); see Citizens of
14 Goleta Valley, et al. v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal. 3d 553, 566.) The EIR failed to
15 identify or analyze a reasonable range of alternatives, or to reject alternatives based on
16 infeasibility supported by substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21081.5; CEQA
17 Guidelines, § 15091(b), (c).)

18 Failure to Analyze and Disclose Impacts on the Environment

19 99. It is well-established that public agencies, including CEQA responsible agencies,

20 are not permitted to approve projects until after the completion of adequate CEQA review.

21 (River Watch v. Olivenhain Muni. Water Dist. (2009) 170 Cal.App.4th 1186, 1215 [striking down
22 responsible agency's approval where it preceded CEQA review].) CDFW committed a procedural
23 violation by approving a project in the ITP that was not identified or analyzed in the Final EIR.

24 100. Valley District is informed and believes that in evaluating the incidental take
25 application from DWR, CDFW switched from a substantial evidence- and science-based approach
26 to one that improperly focused on "no increase in exports." As such, Valley District asserts that
27 CDFW pre-determined that the ITP would not allow any additional SWP exports from the Delta,
28 regardless of what the science and record evidence showed. Given this, CDFW failed to properly

25 1639068v1
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

exercise its independent judgment in reviewing the certified Final EIR as a responsible agency
2 before approving the project. CDFW's approval of the ITP was pre-determined and without

3 scientific or factual basis, in violation of CEQA.

101. In approving the incidental take permit despite the fact that its impacts were never
analyzed in any CEQA document, CDFW abused its discretion and violated CEQA's procedural

mandates.

Improper Imposition of Mitigation Measures

102. Mitigation measures are only required to minimize project's significant
environmental impacts. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15126.4(a)(3).) Mitigation for impacts that are
10 less than significant is not required. (Ibid.) Further, there must be a nexus and proportionality
11 between the mitigation measure imposed and the identified significant impact on the environment.

dTI UNVHE AANMOC 12 (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15126.4(a)(4).) Finally, any mitigation must be "feasible," or "capable
13 of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time." (Cal. Code
14 Regs., tit. 14, § 15364.)

15 103. CDFW's Notice of Determination states that: (1) CDFW concluded that the ITP
16 would not have any significant impacts on the environment; (2) CDFW imposed "additional"
17 mitigation measures as conditions of approval; (3) CDFW approved a mitigation monitoring and
18 reporting program; and (4) CDFW made CEQA findings as a responsible agency. In its CEQA
19 findingsand despite CEQA's requirement that "mitigation" have a nexus to a an environmental
20 impact and be roughly proportionate to that impact (Cal. Code Regs., tit.14, § 15126.4(a)(4))-
21 CDFW did not identify any significant environmental impacts that the mitigation measures were
22 intended to minimize. Instead, CDFW asserted that the CEQA findings were not required and
23 were only informational. However, the CEQA findings are not supported by substantial evidence
24 in the record, and, as such, are misleading.

25 104. Further, given that the Final EIR does not find any potentially significant impacts,
26 there is no nexus between the mitigation measures and the alleged significant impacts that CDFW
27 imposed. In addition, because the Final EIR does not identify any potentially significant impacts,
28 there is no proportionality between the mitigation measures and the alleged significant impacts

26 1639058v1
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 that the measures are intended to minimize.

2

3 California Environmental Quality Act Findings that Are Not Supported by
Substantial Evidence

4 105. Under CEQA, substantial evidence must support a responsible agency's findings
5 regarding potentially significant impacts, and a "brief rationale" linking the substantial evidence to
6 the findings must be provided. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, §§ 15091, 15096.) Although the Final
7 EIR did not identify any significant impacts, CDFW nonetheless adopted CEQA findings.
8 (CDFW CEQA Findings, 4, 5.) The findings are affirmatively misleading and contradictory
9 because they are based upon Final EIR that did not actually analyze the project described in the
10| incidental take permit. CDFW's CEQA findings are replete with references to the Final EIR and

DOWNEY BRAND LLP 11 statements purporting that the Final EIR covers and analyzed the incidental take permit's project
12 impacts. (See, e.g., CDFW's CEQA Findings, 5, 7.) As such, CEQA findings affirmatively misled
13 decision-makers as well as the public for whom the findings were allegedly an "information
14 disclosure" tool, in a manner constituting a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

15

16 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

17 (Petition for Writ of Mandate Pursuant to Code Civ. Proc. §§ 1085 and 1094.5-Violation of

18 CEQA by Lead Agency)

19 (Against Respondent DWR, Real Party in Interest CDFW and DOES 1-50)

106. Valley District incorporates herein by reference each previous paragraph of this
20 Petition and Complaint as though set forth here in full.

21 107. "[T]he legislature intended [CEQA] to be interpreted in such manner as to afford
22 the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory
23 language." (City of San Diego V. Board of Trustees of the California State University (2015) 61
24 Cal.4th 945, 963, internal punctuation and citation omitted.) When complying with California
25 Environmental Quality Act, a lead agency must proceed in the manner required by law, and its
26 determinations must be supported by substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5.)
27 108. The lead agency is required to analyze the potential environmental impacts of its
28 proposed actions in an EIR. The purpose of an EIR is to provide public agencies and the public in

1639068vl 27
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1

2 general with detailed information about the likely effects of a proposed project on the
environment. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21061.) An EIR must fully analyze and disclose all of the
3 project's potentially significant environmental effects. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21100(b)(1).) To
4 be considered adequate, an EIR must, at minimum, provide a sufficient degree of analysis and
5 information to enable decision-makers to take action that intelligently accounts for environmental
6 consequences. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15151.)

7 109. In addition to full disclosure and analysis of the environmental effects of the
8 proposed action, CEQA also requires lead agencies to identify effective and enforceable

9 mitigation measures to avoid or substantially lessen the proposal's adverse impacts; to consider a
10 range of alternatives and to implement them where feasible; to make adequate findings, including

DOWNEY BRAND LLP 11 a statement of overriding considerations for those significant environmental impacts that cannot be
12 avoided; and to do all of these things meaningfully and in good faith, in a public forum, before the
13 agency's decision is made. DWR, as lead agency, violated CEQA by failing to comply with these
14 requirements, by failing to proceed in the manner required by law, by certifying an EIR that failed
15 to minimally serve its informational purposes, and by making findings not supported by
16 substantial evidence. The defects in the Final EIR are so pervasive and fundamental that they
17 make informed decision-making and informed public participation impossible. As the lead
18 agency, DWR's certification of the Final EIR constitutes a procedural violation of CEQA.
19 Procedural violations are reviewed de novo in this court. (See Sierra Club v. County of Fresno
20 (2018) 6 Cal.5th 502, 512, 516.) DWR's actions constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion
21 because DWR failed to proceed in a manner required by law. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5.)
22 The Final BIR's defects and DWR's CEQA violations include, but are not limited to the

23 following:

24

25 110. Shifting Project Description
A stable and consistent project description is essential to achieving CEQA's
26 mandate. "An accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an informative
27 and legally sufficient EIR." (County of Inyo V. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185,
28 193.) DWR violated this fundamental mandate because the project description was not stable

1639068v1 28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 throughout the administrative process and because the project that DWR ultimately approved was

2 not adequately analyzed in the Final EIR.

3 Failure to Analyze the Project

111. DWR failed to comply with CEQA requirement that the lead agency must disclose

5 and analyze a project's impacts. The modified Alternative 2b project first appeared in the Final

6 EIR. Thus, the Draft EIR did not disclose or analyze its potentially significant impacts. The

7 components of modified Alternative 2(b) that were never modeled or analyzed, and the effects of
8 which were never disclosed to the public or decision-makers, include, but are not limited to:

9 deferral of up to 150,000 acre-feet of spring outflow and 100,000 acre-feet of summer
10 outflow to subsequent years, including the use of Oroville storage;

11 daily winter-run Chinook salmon loss trigger for export reduction;

J'TI INVIE AHNMOI 12 daily spring-run Chinook salmon loss trigger;
13 larval Delta smelt operations between -1,250 and -5,000 cfs Old and Middle River flow;

14 November and December winter-run Chinook salmon loss triggers for export reductions;
15 and

16 new salinity target of 4 ppt at Belden's Landing in Suisun Marsh.

17 112. Furthermore, the Final EIR does not disclose or analyze the potential impacts of
18 reduction in exports under Alternative 2(b) on the ability of SWP contractors to use SWP water to
19 recharge groundwater basins. As noted above, Valley District uses its SWP supplies, in part, to
20 recharge groundwater basins within its service area to provide water for extended droughts. The
21 impacts of modified Alternative 2(b) on such groundwater banking/storage were never considered

22 in the Final EIR.

23 Failure to Recirculate the Draft Environmental Impact Report Despite Changing the Project
24 Purpose, Description, and Adding Significant New Informatione

25 113. A lead agency must recirculate an environmental impact report when "significant
26 new information" is added to the environmental impact report after a draft EIR is released to the a
27 public but before the final EIR is certified. (Cal. Code Regs., tit.14, § 15088.5.) Here, the Final
28 EIR presents a new project that was not included in the Draft EIR. The Final EIR also includes

29 1639068v1
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 significant new modeling and analysis that was never provided to the public for review and
2 comment. Although incomplete, the Final EIR also includes two brand new technical appendices

3

4 (J and K); substantial revisions to four other technical appendices (C, E, F, and H); and provides t
dozen new technical reports and modeling outcomes all of which constitutes significant new
5 information that was never circulated for public review. DWR's failure to recirculate the
6 environmental impact report despite this significant new information precluded informed public
7 comment and informed decision-making. This is a procedural violation of CEQA's requirements.

8

9 114. Failure to Evaluate a Reasonable Range of Alternatives
When deciding whether to approve a proposed project with significant
10 environmental effects, agencies are required to consider and evaluate a reasonable range of

DOWNEY BRAND LLP 11 alternatives that offer environmental advantages over the proposed project and that may feasibly
12 be accomplished in a successful manner. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.6(c), (d); see Citizens of
13 Goleta Valley, et al. v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal. 3d 553, 566.) The EIR failed to
14 identify or analyze a reasonable range of alternatives, or to reject alternatives based on
15 infeasibility supported by substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21081.5; CEQA
16 Guidelines, § 15091(b), (c).)

17

18 115. Inadequate Response to Comments
Under CEQA, a lead agency must make a good faith, reasoned analysis in response
19 to comments provided during the public comment period. (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15088.)
20 DWR's responses to comments, however, are legally inadequate.

21

22 116. No Substantial Evidence to Support Certification

23 As set forth herein, there is no substantial evidence to support DWR's certification

of the Final EIR or the approval of the modified Alternative 2(b). Although the EIR cites to
24 certain "expert opinion," those opinions do not constitute substantial evidence because they are

25 speculative, erroneous, and factually unsupported. (See Cal. Code Regs., tit.14, § 15384 [The
26 opinion of "experts" only constitutes substantial evidence where that opinion is not speculation,
27 accurate, and supported by facts].) Given these defects, the record simply does not contain

28 substantial evidence to support DWR's certification of the Final EIR or its approval of modified

1639068vl 30
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

- Alternative 2(b).

117. The EIR lacks a consistent project description, is based on shifting project
3 objectives, fails to include adequate analysis of the modified Alternative 2(b) project, and includes
4 significant new information requiring recirculation.

5 Inadequate CEQA Findings

6 118. Under CEQA, substantial evidence must support : lead agency's findings regarding

7 potentially significant impacts, and a "brief rationale" linking the substantial evidence to the

8 findings must be provided. (Cal. Code Regs., tit.14, § 15091.) Although DWR's Notice of
Determination states that CEQA findings were made, DWR has not made its findings readily
10 available to the public. Based on the legal inadequacy of the Final EIR, Valley District believes,

11 and on that basis alleges that DWR's CEQA findings are inadequate.
DOWNEY BRAND LLP 12 EIR Inadequate for Responsible Agency Approvals

13 119. Similarly, the prejudicial abuses of discretion described herein render the EIR
14 inadequate under CEQA for purposes of responsible agency approvals, including Respondent
15 CDFW's approval of the ITP. The EIR simply fails as an informational document and cannot

16 support the approval of any permit or project. The flawed EIR is inadequate to support responsible
17 agency approval, and DWR has prejudicially abused its discretion in certifying and relying upon
18 the EIR. Furthermore, DWR made findings as to the adequacy of the document for purposes of
19 responsible agency approvals that are not supported by substantial evidence.

20 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (Breach of Contract against DWR)

22 (Against Defendant DWR and DOES 1-50)

23 120. Valley District incorporates herein by reference each previous paragraph of this

24 Petition and Complaint as though set forth here in full.

25 121. On or about December 30, 1960, DWR and Valley District entered into the SWP
26 Contract. DWR and Valley District have since adopted a number of amendments to the SWP
27 Contract, the most recent amendment occurring on May 28, 2003.

28 122. Article 6(b) of the SWP Contract provides that DWR will make water available for

1639068v1 31
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

delivery to Valley District in the amount set forth in Table A of the SWP Contract. Table A
2 provides that Valley District has an annual maximum entitlement to water in the amount of
3 102,600 afy.

4 123. Valley District performed all, or substantially all, of the significant obligations that

5 the Purchase Contract required of it, or else was excused from performing those obligations.

6 124. DWR actions related to the ITP result in a reduction in the amount of water

7 available for delivery contrary to the terms of the SWP Contract. The reduction is made without
8 the existence of a condition of shortage and as a result of DWR's own conduct. DWR knew

9 Valley District relies on SWP water to satisfy its customers' demand for water, yet DWR did not

10 consult with Valley District prior to adopting the ITP and committing itself to reduced delivery of
11 water to Valley District and other SWP contractors.

12 125. On information and belief, Valley District alleges DWR has, by accepting the terms JTI UNVHA AHNMOC 13 of the ITP to govern the operations of the SWP, also committed itself to reducing the quantity of
14 water available for delivery to SWP contractors in order to satisfy the conditions of the ITP.
15 Valley District further alleges on information and belief that DWR will impose such reductions
16 among the SWP contractors on a pro rata basis.

17 126. A pro rata reduction of Valley District's entitlement to water by DWR is a breach
18 of Article 16(b). Such a reduction is not related to the delivery capability of existing project
19 facilities under Article 58. Nor is the reduction a result of a condition of shortage. Even if DWR

20 were to assert that the reduction in the amount of water available for delivery below the annual
21 entitlement constitutes a condition of shortage, DWR is in breach of Articles 16(b) and 18(f) of the
22 SWP Contract because any such shortage would be the result of DWR's own conduct within
23 DWR's control.

24 127. DWR failed to fulfill its contract obligations by agreeing to mitigation in excess of
25 that required by law, thereby violating Articles 16(b) and 18(f) of the SWP Contract. Even though
26 DWR determined that the proposed project in its Draft EIR did not have any significant
27 environmental impacts and met CESA requirements, it added new project alternatives to its Draft
28 EIR that included new high water-cost actions. DWR further proposed a different, previously

32 1639068vl
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

undisclosed high-water cost alternative in its CESA application, thereby impacting Valley

2 District's water supply reliability and SWP costs in ways in excess of legal requirements. DWR
3 concluded that the new high-water cost alternative that it included in its CESA application
4 satisfied CESA requirements by minimizing and fully mitigating the incidental take associated
with the SWP. Nevertheless, DWR proposed and agreed to yet another, even higher water cost

6 alternative, which included even more export reductions and mitigation, and approved the

7 modified Alternative 2(b) project. The new export reductions and outflow actions contained in the
8 project that DWR ultimately approved are not required to comply with law and thereby violate

9 DWR's contractual obligations to Valley District.

10 128. DWR further failed to fulfill its contractual obligations under Articles 16(b) and 38
11 by accepting an incidental take permit for continued operations of the SWP that violated or was

dTI MNVHE AINMOI 12 otherwise inconsistent with law, specifically CESA, because it includes mitigation and other
13 measures that, among other things:

14 are unnecessary, disproportionate and/or infeasible to address potential
15 environmental and species impacts associated with operation of the SWP;
16 are not supported substantial evidence and/or the best available science;
17 are premised on an incorrect definition of "take" of threatened or endangered

18 species;

19 are inconsistent with the project objectives described in the incidental take permit
20 application;

21 were not subjected to the appropriate or adequate environmental review in violation

22 of CEQA; and

23 include mitigation for take or other actions by third parties.

24 129. As a proximate result of DWR's actions, Valley District has been damaged. Valley
25 District will face a significant financial burden as a result of the permanent loss of water that
26 Valley District would otherwise have received to under the SWP Contract. Alternative sources of
27 water to replace the lost water are uncertain and expensive and there is no guarantee that the
28 quantities lost as a result of DWR's breach can be replaced at all.

33 1639068v1
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

130. Reductions in water supplied from the SWP will create a significant impediment to
2 Valley District's ability to satisfy water demands within its service area. Valley District will be
forced either to replace the water lost as a result of DWR's breach with recycled water, at
4 exorbitant cost, or to impose further reductions on water usage within its service area, again at
great public cost.

6 131. Valley District is informed and believes that its estimated shortfall as a result of
7 DWR's breach will be approximately 6,000 afy, which would result in an annual additional cost to

8 Valley District of millions of dollars per year. Over the ten-year term of the ITP, the cost to

9 replace lost water, if that is even possible, could exceed $100 million. Such costs would
10 ultimately be borne by the public residing in Valley District's service area, many of whom live in
11 disadvantaged communities. Importantly, developing alternative sources to replace SWP water

dTT GNVAE AHNMOC 12 lost as a result of the ITP would, if such efforts are even possible, require many years and

13 significant capital expenditures by Valley District. Accordingly, Valley District faces irreparable
14 harm for which money damages are inadequate and therefore is entitled to specific performance of
15 the SWP Contract.

16 132. Although the full measure of harm caused by DWR's breach is not quantifiable due

17 to the uncertainty of finding alternate water sources and the ongoing and continuous nature of the
18 breach, Valley District will demonstrate any quantifiable compensatory damages according to
19 proof at trial.

20 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing)

22 (Against Defendant DWR and Does 1-50)

23 133. Valley District incorporates herein by reference each previous paragraph of this
24 Petition and Complaint as though set forth here in full.

25 134. Implied in the SWP Contract is a covenant of good faith and fair dealing that
26 neither party would do anything to injure the right of the other to receive the benefits of the

27 contract.

28 135. Valley District performed all, or substantially all, of the significant obligations that

34 1639068v1
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

the Purchase Contract required of it, or else was excused from performing those obligations.

2 136. DWR unfairly and without good faith interfered with Valley District's rights to

3 receive the benefits of the SWP Contract by accepting the terms of the ITP to govern the
4 operations of the SWP and committing to a reduction in the amount of water available for delivery
contrary to the terms of the SWP Contract in order to satisfy the conditions of the ITP. The
6 reduction is made without the existence of a condition of shortage and as a result of DWR's own

7 conduct. DWR knew Valley District relies on SWP water to satisfy its customers' demand for
8 water, yet DWR did not consult with Valley District prior to adopting the incidental take permit

9 and committing itself to reduced delivery of water to Valley District and other SWP contractors.

10 137. DWR has further unfairly and without good faith interfered with Valley District's
11 rights to receive the benefits of the SWP Contract by accepting an incidental take permit for

ITI ONVEE AHNMOC 12 continued operations of the SWP that violated or was otherwise inconsistent with law, as alleged
13 more specifically above.

14 138. As a proximate result of DWR's actions, Valley District has been damaged. Valley
15 District a will face a significant financial burden as result of the permanent loss of water that
16 Valley District would otherwise have received under the SWP Contract. Alternative sources of

17 water to replace the lost water are uncertain and there is no guarantee that the quantities lost as a
18 result of DWR's breach can be replaced at all.

19 139. Reductions in water supplied from the SWP will create a significant impediment to
20 Valley District's ability to satisfy water demands within its service area. Valley District will be
21 forced either to replace the water lost as a result of DWR's breach with recycled water, at
22 exorbitant cost, or to impose further reductions on water usage within its service area, again at
23 great public cost.

24 140. Valley District is informed and believes that its estimated shortfall as a result of
25 DWR's breach will be approximately 6,000 afy, which would result in an annual additional cost to
26 Valley District of millions of dollars per year. Over the ten-year term of the ITP, the cost to
27 replace lost water, if that is even possible, could exceed $100 million. Such costs would
28 ultimately be borne by the public residing in Valley District's service area, many of whom live in

35 1639068v1
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 disadvantaged communities. Importantly, developing alternative sources to replace SWP water
2 lost as a result of the ITP would, if such efforts are even possible, require many years and

3 significant capital expenditures by Valley District. Accordingly, Valley District faces irreparable

4 harm for which money damages are inadequate and therefore is entitled to specific performance of

5 the SWP Contract.

6 141. Although the ultimate measure of harm caused by DWR's breach is not

7 quantifiable due to the uncertainty of finding alternate water sources and the ongoing and

8 continuous nature of the breach, Valley District will demonstrate any quantifiable compensatory
9 damages according to proof at trial.

10 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

11 (Breach of Contract-Anticipatory Repudiation against DWR)

12 (Against Defendant DWR and DOES 1-50) J'TI ONVIE AENMOG 13 (In the Alternative)

14 142. Valley District incorporates herein by reference each previous paragraph of this
15 Petition and Complaint as though set forth here in full.

16 143. DWR has unequivocally and expressly repudiated the SWP Contract because it has,
17 by accepting the terms of the ITP to govern the operations of the SWP, committed itself to
18 reducing the quantity of available for delivery contrary to the terms of the SWP Contract in order
19 to satisfy the conditions of the ITP. The reduction is made without the existence of a condition of
20 shortage and as a result of DWR's own conduct. Moreover, by accepting the terms of the ITP to
21 govern the operations of the SWP, DWR has put performance of the SWP Contract out of DWR's

22 power to perform such as to make substantial performance of the SWP Contract impossible.
23 144. DWR's repudiation of the SWP Contract has not been retracted.

24 145. Valley District is prepared to perform all of the significant obligations that the SWP
25 Contract requires of it, or else is excused from performing those obligations.

26 146. As proximate result of DWR's repudiation of the SWP Contract, Valley District
27 will be damaged. Valley District will face a significant financial burden as a result of the

28 permanent loss of water that Valley District would otherwise have received under the SWP

36 1639068v1

8 148. Valley District is informed and believes that its estimated shortfall as result of
9 DWR's breach will be approximately 6,000 afy, which would result in an annual additional cost to
10 Valley District of millions of dollars per year. Over the ten-year term of the ITP, the cost to
11 replace lost water, if that is even possible, could exceed $100 million. Such costs would

d'TI ANVHE AENMOG 12 ultimately be borne by the public residing in Valley District's service area, many of whom live in
13 disadvantaged communities. Importantly, developing alternative sources to replace SWP water
14 lost as a result of the ITP would, if such efforts are even possible, require many years and
15 significant capital expenditures by Valley District. Accordingly, Valley District faces irreparable
16 harm for which money damages are inadequate and therefore is entitled to specific performance of
17 the SWP Contract.

18 149. Although the ultimate measure of harm caused by DWR's repudiation is not
19 quantifiable due to the uncertainty of finding alternate water sources, Valley District will
20 demonstrate any quantifiable compensatory damages according to proof at trial.

21 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

22 (Violation of the United States Constitution and California Constitutions)

23 (Against Defendants CDFW, DWR, and DOES 1-50)

24 150. Valley District incorporates herein by reference each previous paragraph of this
25 Petition and Complaint as though set forth here in full.

26 151. The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution
27 provides that private property shall not "be taken for public use, without just compensation."
28 (U.S. Const., Amend. V.) The Takings Clause of article 1, section 19(a) of the California

37 1639058vl
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

Constitution similarly provides that private property "may be taken or damaged for a public use
and only when just compensation, ascertained by jury unless waived, has first been paid to, or
into court for, the owner."

152. Under the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, the government may only impose a
condition requiring an individual to give up a constitutional right when the government
demonstrates that there is an "essential nexus" and "rough proportionality" between the required
dedication and the projected impact of the proposed activity. (See e.g., Nollan v. California
Coastal Commission (1987) 483 U.S. 825; Dolan v. City of Tigard (1994) 512 U.S. 374 : Koontz

9 V. St. Johns River Water Management Dist. (2013) 570 U.S. 595, 604 (describing the
10 unconstitutional conditions doctrine as "an overarching principle...that vindicates the
11 constitution's enumerated rights by preventing the government from coercing people into giving

LLP INVHE AHNMOI 12 them up").)

13 153. Under the takings clause, a property owner has the constitutional right to be paid
14 just compensation when the government takes his or her property for public use.

15 154. Valley District's SWP contract is a water right that amounts to a constitutionally
16 protected interest in property that cannot be taken without just compensation. (See, e.g.,
17 International Paper Co. v. United States (1931) 282 U.S. 399, 404.)
in the face of objections by 18 155. Here, the ITP imposes conditions wherein DWR has
19 Valley District through the SWC - dedicated a portion of Valley District's water right to public

20 use without being paid just compensation. The conditions imposed by the ITP do not bear a
21 reasonable relationship to the impacts of the SWP on listed species and neither DWR nor CDFW
22 have demonstrated that there is an essential nexus between SWP impacts on the environment and
23 the conditions imposed by the ITP.

24 156. On information and belief, Valley District alleges that the incidental take permit
25 imposes conditions that will require DWR to reduce the amount of water available for delivery to
26 SWP contractors by up to 220,000 afy. Valley District further alleges, again on information and
27 belief, that DWR has, by accepting the terms of the ITP to govern the operations of the SWP, also
28 committed itself to reducing the quantity of water available for delivery to SWP contractors in

38 1639068vl
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 order to satisfy the conditions of the ITP. The conditions imposed by the ITP are subject to
2 CDFW enforcement and are to be executed by DWR.

3 157. By applying for the incidental take permit and carrying out the reduction in Valley

4 District's annual allocated share, Valley District is informed and believes and thereupon alleges
5 that DWR will divert water for the public benefit of fish and wildlife located in the Sacramento-

6 San Joaquin River Delta that Valley District would otherwise have been entitled to under the SWP

7 Contract. In this way, the conditions imposed by CDFW through the ITP violate Valley District's
8 constitutionally protected property right to water under the SWP Contract.

158. CDFW and DWR's taking of Valley District's property will damage Valley District
10 in an amount not yet fully ascertained, but which shall be determined according to proof at trial.

11 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

12 prays for judgment as follows: dTI ONVNE AHNMOC WHEREFORE, Valley District

13 1. For interlocutory and permanent injunctive relief restraining DWR and CDFW
14 from taking any action to carry out the modified Alternative 2b Project or the ITP;

15 2. For a peremptory writ of mandate commanding the following: (1) DWR to set
16 aside and vacate its approval of the modified Alternative 2b Project, certification of the Final EIR,
17 and CEQA lead agency findings; (2) CDFW to set aside and vacate its issuance of the ITP, CESA
18 findings, and CEQA responsible agency findings; (3) DWR and CDFW to refrain from granting
19 any further approvals, authorizations, or permits for the project until the DWR and CDFW comply
20 with CESA and CEQA; and (4) DWR to suspend any and all activities related to the project and
21 its implementation until CEQA and CESA have been satisfied;

22 3. For a stay, temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, and permanent
23 prohibitory injunction prohibiting DWR and CDFW from pursuing, authorizing, undertaking,
24 implementing, or otherwise operating the SWP pursuant to their approval of the project pending
25 completion of this litigation and full compliance with CEQA and CESA;

26 4. For a declaration that DWR breached the SWP Contract with Valley District;

27 5. For a declaration that DWR and CDFW's adoption and enforcement of the
28 incidental take permit constitutes a taking of Valley District's property for public use requiring

39 1639068vl

due process and the payment of just compensation;

2 6. For specific performance of DWR's obligations to Valley District under the SWP

3 Contract;

4 7. For compensatory damages in an amount according to proof at time of trial;

5 8. For just compensation for the quantity of water diverted by CDFW and DWR in the
6 implementation of the ITP that Valley District would have been entitled to under its SWP

7 Contract;

8 9. For interest in an amount according to proof at time of trial;

10. For Valley District's costs of suit;

10 11. For Valley District's reasonable attorneys' fees as authorized by Code of Civil
11 Procedure sections 1021.5 and 1036, Government Code section 800 and any other applicable

d'II CNVHE AINMOI 12 provisions of law; and

13 12. For such other relief as the Court may deem just and proper.

(2) Those facilities and programs described in (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) below which, in the State's determination, are engineeringly feasible and capable of producing project water which is economically competitive with alternative new water supply sources, provided that, in the State's determination, the construction and operation of such facilities and programs will not interfere with the requested deliveries of annual entitlement to any contractor other than the sponsoring contractor, and will not result in any greater annual charges to any contractor other than the sponsoring contractor than would have occurred with the construction at the same time of alternative new water supply sources which are either reservoirs located north of the Delta or off-Aqueduct storage reservoirs located south or west of the Delta designed to supply water to the California Aqueduct. The following facilities and programs shall hereinafter be referred to as "Local Projects":
(A) On-stream and off-stream surface storage reservoirs not provided for in Section 12938 of the Water Code, that will produce project water for the System for a period of time agreed to by the sponsoring contractor;
(B) Ground water storage facilities that will produce project water for the System for a period of time agreed to by the sponsoring contractor;
(C) Waste water reclamation facilities that will produce project water for the System for a period of time agreed to by the sponsoring contractor;
(D) Water and facilities for delivering water purchased by the State for the System for a period of time agreed to by the sponsoring contractor; provided that the economic test specified herein shall be applied to the cost of these
facilities together with the cost of the purchased water; and
(E) Future water conservation programs and facilities that will reduce demands by the sponsoring contractor for project water from the System for a period of time agreed to by the sponsoring contractor and will thereby have the
effect of increasing project water available in the Delta for distribution,
(3) Whether a Local Project described in (2) above shall be considered economically competitive shall be determined by the State by comparing, in an engineering and economic analysis, such Local Project with alternative new water supply sources which are either reservoirs located north of the Delta or off-Aqueduct storage

reservoirs located south or west of the Delta designed to supply water to the California Aqueduct. The analysis for such alternative new water supply sources shall use the average cost per acre-foot of yield in the latest studies made for such sources by the State and shall compare those facilities with the proposed Local Project using commonly accepted engineering economics. In the case of a Local Project to be funded in part by the
State as part of the System and in part from other sources, the economic analysis
specified herein shall be applied only to the portion to be funded by the State as part of
the System.
(4) The Local Projects in (2) above shall not be constructed or implemented unless or until:

(A) The sponsoring contractor signs a written agreement with the State
which:
(i) Contains the sponsoring contractor's approval of such
facility or program.
(ii) Specifies the yield and the period of time during which the
water from the Local Project shall constitute project water; and
(iii) Specifies the disposition of such Local Project or of the yield from such Local Project upon the expiration of such period of
time; and
(B) All contractors within whose boundaries any portion of such Local Project is located, and who are not sponsoring contractors for such Local Project give their written approval of such Local Project.
(5) "Sponsoring contractor" as used in this Article 1(h) shall mean the contractor or contractors who either will receive the yield from facilities described in 2(A), (B), (C), or (D) above, or agree to reduce demands for project water from the
System pursuant to 2(E) above.
(6) In the event of a shortage in water supply within the meaning of Article 18(a), the determination of whether to count, in whole or in part, the yield from facilities described in 2(A), (B), (C), or (D) above, or the reduced demand from future conservation programs described in 2(E) above in the allocation of deficiencies among contractors will be based on a project-by-project evaluation taking into consideration such factors as any limitation on the use of the water from such facilities and whether the
sponsoring contractor has access to project water from the Delta as an alternate to such
facilities.
(i)4 "Project transportation facilities" shall mean the following project facilities:
(1) All those facilities specified in subparagraph (2) of Section 12934(d) of the Water Code except: The reservoir near Los Banos in Merced County; the reach of the
San Joaquin Valley-Southern California Aqueduct extending from the Delta to the reservoir near Los Banos in Merced County, to the extent required for water conservation as determined by the State; the North Bay Aqueduct extending to a terminal reservoir in

Marin County; the South Bay Aqueduct extending to terminal reservoirs in the Counties of Alameda and Santa Clara; the Pacheco Pass Tunnel Aqueduct extending from a
reservoir near Los Banos in Merced County to terminus in Pacheco Creek in Santa Clara County; and the Coastal Aqueduct beginning on the San Joaquin Valley-Southern California Aqueduct in the vicinity of Avenal, Kings County, and extending to terminus at the Santa Maria River; and the West Branch Aqueduct extending from the South Portal of the Tehachapi Tunnels to a terminus in the a vicinity of Newhall, Los Angeles County.
(2) Facilities for the generation and transmission of electrical energy of the following types:
(A) Hydroelectric generating and transmission facilities, whose operation is dependent on the transportation of project water, or on releases to
channels downstream of project facilities defined under (1) above. Such facilities
shall be called "project aqueduct power recovery plants."
(B) All other generating and associated transmission facilities, except those dependent on water from project conservation facilities, for the generation of power. These facilities shall be called "off-aqueduct power facilities" and shall consist of the State's interest in the Reid-Gardner and any other generating and associated transmission facilities, constructed or financed in whole or in part by the State, which are economically competitive with alternative power supply sources as determined by the State.

State and the United States and others regarding the division of utilization of waters of the Delta
or streams tributary thereto.
(m)6 Annual Table A Amount
'Annual Table A Amount" shall mean the amount of project water set forth in Table A of this contract that the State, pursuant to the obligations of this contract and applicable law, makes available for delivery to the District at the delivery structures provided for the District. The term Annual Table A Amount shall not be interpreted to mean that in each year the State will be able to make that quantity of project water available to the District. The Annual Table A Amounts
and the terms of this contract reflect an expectation that under certain conditions the District will receive its full Annual Table A Amount; but that under other conditions only a lesser amount, allocated in accordance with this contract, may be made available to the District. This recognition that full Annual Table A Amounts will not be deliverable under all conditions does
not change the obligations of the State under this contract, including but not limited to, the obligations to make all reasonable efforts to complete the project facilities, to perfect and protect water rights, and to allocate among contractors the supply available in any year, as set forth in Articles 6(b), 6(c), 16(b) and 18, in the manner and subject to the terms and conditions of those articles and this contract. Where the term "annual entitlement" appears elsewhere in this contract, it shall mean "Annual Table A Amount." The State agrees that in future amendments to this and other contractor's contracts, in lieu of the term "annual entitlement," the term "Annual
Table A Amount" will be used and will have the same meaning as "annual entitlement"
wherever that term is used.
(n) Maximum Annual Table A Amount
"Maximum annual entitlement" shall mean the maximum annual amounts set forth in Table A of this contract, and where the term "maximum annual entitlement" appears elsewhere in this contract it shall mean "Maximum Annual Table A Amounts."
(o) "Supplemental conservation facilities" shall mean those facilities provided for in Section 12938 of the Water Code which will serve the purpose of supplying water in addition to the total of the maximum annual entitlements of all contractors, or in addition to the minimum project yield, if greater than said total, and for meeting local needs.
(p) "Supplemental water" shall mean water made available by supplemental conservation facilities, in excess of the total of the maximum annual entitlements of all contractors, or in excess of the minimum project yield, if greater than said total.
(q) "Year" shall mean the 12-month period from January through December 31, both dates inclusive.
(r) "Year of initial water delivery" shall mean the year when project water will first be available for delivery to a contractor pursuant to its contract with the State.
(s)8 "Project interest rate" shall mean the weighted average interest rate on bonds, advances, or loans listed in this section to the extent the proceeds of any such bonds, advances, or loans are for construction of the State Water Facilities defined in Section 12934(d) of the

Water Code, the additional project conservation facilities, and the supplemental conservation facilities (except off-aqueduct power facilities; water system facilities; advances for delivery structures, measuring devices and excess capacity; and East Branch Enlargement Facilities).
The project interest rate shall be calculated as a decimal fraction to five places by dividing (i) the total interest cost required to be paid or credited by the State during the life of the indebtedness or advance by (ii) the total of the products of the various principal amounts and the respective terms in years of all such amounts. The bonds, advances, or loans used in calculating the project interest rate shall be:
(1) General obligation bonds issued by the State under the Bond Act, except that any
premium received on the sale of these bonds shall not be included in the
calculation of the project interest rate,
(2) Revenue bonds issued by the State under the Central Valley Project Act after May 1, 1969,
(3) Bonds issued by the State under any other authority granted by the Legislature or the voters,
(4) Bonds issued by any agency, district, political subdivision, public corporation, or nonprofit corporation of this State,
(5) Funds advanced by any contractor without the actual incurring of bonded debt therefor, for which the net interest cost and terms shall be those which would have resulted if the contractor had sold bonds for the purpose of funding the advance, as determined by the State,
(6) Funds borrowed from the General Fund or other funds in the Treasury of the State of California, for which the total interest cost shall be computed at the interest rate earned over the period of such borrowing by moneys in the Surplus Money Investment Fund of such Treasury invested in securities, and
(7) Any other financing capability available in the Treasury of the State of California at whatever interest rate and other financing costs are provided in the law authorizing such borrowing. However, the use of other financing from the State Treasury is intended to involve only short term borrowing at interest rates and other financing costs no greater than those charged to other State agencies during the same period until such time as the Department can sell bonds and reimburse the source of the short term borrowing from the proceeds of the bond sale.
(t) "Capital costs" shall mean all costs incurred subsequent to authorization of a
facility for construction by the Legislature or by administrative action pursuant to Section 11290 of the Water Code and to the Bond Act, including those so incurred prior to the beginning of the project repayment period as herein defined and any accrued unpaid interest charges thereon at the rates specified herein, which are properly chargeable to the construction of and the furnishing of equipment for the facilities of the System, including the costs of surveys, engineering studies, exploratory work, designs, preparation of construction plans and specifications, acquisition of lands, easements and rights-of-way, relocation work, and essential administrative work in connection therewith, all as shown upon the official records of the Department of Water Resources.

(b) <Criteria for Determining Capacity of Transportation Facilities> The State shall design and construct the project transportation facilities so as to provide in each reach thereof, including reservoirs, the capacity necessary to enable delivery of project water in each year to the District and to other contractors in the maximum monthly amounts and at the locations, times, and maximum rates specified or provided for in their respective contracts for
such year, and shall include in each such reach such capacity as is economically justified in the judgment of the State to compensate for scheduled outages for purposes of necessary investigation, inspection, maintenance, repair or replacement of project facilities, and for losses of water due to evaporation, leakage, seepage, or other causes. Subject to Articles 6(b), 7(b), 12(b), and 12(c), the capacity so to be provided by the State for each reach of the project transportation facilities necessary for transporting water to the District shall be sufficient to enable delivery to the District in each month of any year of an amount of water up to but not exceeding eleven percent (11%) of the District's annual entitlement for the respective year and, upon completion of the project facilities, to enable delivery to the District in each month of any year of an amount of water up to but not exceeding eleven percent (11%) of the District's maximum annual entitlement: Provided, That regulatory storage reservoirs included in the
project transportation facilities may be utilized in conjunction with conveyance capacity provided in said facilities for delivery to the District of the foregoing monthly amounts, subject to the retention at all times, except during periods of emergency, in each reservoir on the East Branch Aqueduct of an amount of stored water reasonably sufficient to meet emergency requirements of the District for project water during the respective year.
(c) <Inspection of Project Plans and Specifications> The District shall have a reasonable opportunity to inspect and study the State's plans and specifications for all project facilities during the planning stage and prior to the solicitation of bids for the construction thereof, and may make comments and recommendations thereon to the State. Such privilege shall also extend to any plans and specifications or proposed agreements for the use by the State, in conjunction with the project facilities, of facilities owned by an entity other than the State. The State shall not enter into any such agreement which would impair the State's ability to perform fully its obligations under this contract.
(d) <Restriction on Bond Sales> No bonds shall be sold nor funds expended under the authority of the Bond Act for the construction of any aqueduct or appurtenance thereto included in the System unless and until contracts are executed which will insure the recovery by the State of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of those capital costs of the particular aqueduct and any appurtenances thereto which shall be reimbursable by the contractors as determined by the State; nor shall any bonds be sold or funds expended under the authority of the Bond Act for the construction of any project conservation facility or supplemental conservation facility, unless and until contracts are executed which, together with estimated revenues from the sale or other disposal of electrical energy generated in connection with operation of project conservation facilities and supplemental conservation facilities, will insure the recovery by the State of at least seventy-five percent (75%) of those capital costs of the particular facility which shall be reimbursable by the contractors as determined by the State: Provided, That the foregoing limitations shall not apply with respect to: (1) surveys, engineering studies, exploratory work, designs, preparation of construction plans and specifications, acquisition of lands, easements and rights of way, relocation work, and essential administrative work in connection therewith; (2) construction for which appropriations had been made prior to approval of the Bond Act by the

voters of the State of California; and (3) construction of facilities pursuant to an agreement between the State and the United States.
(e) <Failure to Begin Construction> The State shall make all reasonable efforts to commence construction of the project transportation facilities on or before June 30, 1963. In the
event that no contract for construction of project transportation facilities south of the San Luis Canal of the San Luis unit of the Federal Central Valley Project has been let on or before December 31, 1964, and that no bonds have been issued nor funds expended for construction of said facilities by that date, the District at any time after December 31, 1964, may at its option terminate this contract by giving notice of such termination to the State, such termination to be effective six (6) months after the giving of such notice, whereupon both parties hereto shall be relieved of all further obligations hereunder: Provided, That if the District has not theretofore given such notice, this option shall expire upon the letting by the State of a contract for construction of said facilities at any time after March 31, 1965.
(f) <Failure to Complete Facilities> In the event that the State fails or is unable to
complete construction of any portion or portions of the project transportation facilities necessary to deliver water to the District as provided in this contract, and gives the District written notice thereof, or by reason of such failure or inability construction of said facilities has ceased for a
period of two and one-half (2½) years, the District, if it be not then in default and without exclusion of such other rights as it may have under this contract, may exercise the following
options:
(1) The District may provide funds to the State in such amounts and at such times as may be necessary to enable the State to complete construction of such uncompleted portion or portions of the project transportation facilities to the extent necessary for the transport and delivery of water to the District as provided for in this contract: Provided, That the State shall be and remain the owner of such project transportation facilities or portions thereof constructed in whole or in part with funds provided by the District, and shall be and remain obligated to operate, maintain, repair and replace such facilities to the full extent contemplated in this contract: Provided further, That the amount of any funds so provided by the District shall be credited by the
State against the District's payment obligation under the capital cost component of the Transportation Charge, but the District shall be and remain obligated to pay its share of any capital costs of the above-described facilities not paid for with such funds, together with its proportionate share of the operation, maintenance, power and replacement costs of such facilities.
(2) The District may at its own expense, and on a joint venture basis if such an arrangement is made with other contractors having similar options, connect to the project
transportation facilities constructed by the State for the purpose of receiving project water to which it is entitled under this contract. In such event and notwithstanding any other provisions of this contract, the structures for delivery of project water to the District pursuant hereto shall thereafter be deemed to be located at such point of connection. Specific arrangements for acquiring, constructing, operating, maintaining, and replacing the District's facilities at the point of connection thereof with the State's facilities shall be in accordance with terms and conditions mutually agreed upon by the parties: Provided, That the State shall be and remain the owner of all facilities constructed by it to said point

of connection, and the District shall be and remain obligated to pay its proportionate share of the costs thereof.
(g)31 Adjustments Due to Supplemental Financing Costs
(1) If a contractor, with approval of the State, advances funds to the State to assist the State in financing construction of project facilities (not including delivery structures, measuring devices and excess capacity), such advance shall be amortized by means of annual credits to the contractor having made such advance of funds to the State, with such credits being equal to the actual bond service obligations payable by such contractor by reason of such advance or, if no bonded debt was incurred, then such credits shall be sufficient to cover the repayment of principal and interest costs which would have resulted if the contractor had sold bonds for the purpose of funding the advance as determined by the State.
(2) If, after May 1, 1969, any source of funds other than those provided by the Bond Act is employed to finance construction of specific project facilities, any additional costs incurred because of such financing will not be charged to the contractors, except for adjustments to the "project interest rate".

18.32 Shortage in Water Supply.
(a) Shortages; Delivery Priorities
In any year in which there may occur a shortage due to drought or any other cause
whatsoever, in the supply of project water available for delivery to the contractors, with the result that such supply is less than the total of the annual entitlements of all contractors for that
year, the State shall allocate the available supply in proportion to each contractor's annual entitlement as set forth in its Table A for that year and shall reduce the allocation of project water to each contractor using such water for agricultural purposes and to each contractor using such
water for other purposes by the same percentage of their respective annual entitlements for that year: Provided, that the State may allocate on some other basis if such is required to meet minimum demands of contractors for domestic supply, fire protection, or sanitation during the year. If a contractor is allocated more water than it requested, the excess water shall be reallocated among the other contractors in proportion to their annual entitlements as provided for above. The foregoing provisions of this subdivision shall be inoperative to the extent necessary to comply with subdivision (c) of this article and to the extent that a contractor's annual
entitlement for the respective year reflects established rights under the area of origin statutes precluding a reduction in deliveries to such contractor.
<(b) Permanent Shortage; Reduction of Entitlements - Deleted>
(c) Permanent Shortage; Contracts for Areas-of-Origin
In the event that the State, because of the establishment by a party of a prior right to water under the provisions of Sections 11460 through 11463 of the Water Code, enters into a contract with such party for dependable supply of project water, which contract will cause a permanent shortage in the supply of project water to be made available to the District hereunder:

It is intended only to provide a convenient reference source, and the Department of Water Resources is unable to provide assurances that this integrated version accurately represents the original documents. For legal purposes, or when precise accuracy is required, users should direct their attention to original source documents rather than this integrated version.

(1) The State shall: (i) equitably redistribute the costs of all transportation facilities included in the System among all contractors for project water, taking into account the diminution of the supply to the District and other prior contractors in accordance with the terms of their contracts, and (ii) revise the District's annual entitlements and maximum annual entitlement, by amendment of Table A of this contract to correspond to the reduced supply of project water to be made available to the District: Provided, That such redistribution of costs of transportation facilities shall not be made until there has been reasonable opportunity for the District to exercise the option provided for in (2) below, and for other prior contractors to exercise similar options.
(2) The District, at its option, shall have the right to use any of the project transportation facilities which by reason of such permanent shortage in the supply of project water to be made available to the District are not required for delivery of project water to the District, to transport water procured by it from any other source: Provided, That such use shall be within the limits of the capacities provided in the project transportation facilities for service to the District under this contract: Provided further,
That, except to the extent such limitation in Section 12931 of the Water Code be
changed, the District shall not use the project transportation facilities under this option to
transport water the right to which was secured by the District through eminent domain unless such use be approved by the Legislature by concurrent resolution with a majority of the members elected to each house voting in favor thereof. This option shall terminate upon a redistribution of costs of transportation facilities by the State pursuant to (1) above. In the event that this option is exercised, the State shall take such fact into account in making such redistribution of costs, and shall offset such use as is made of the project transportation facilities pursuant thereto against any reduction in the District's payment obligation hereunder resulting from such redistribution of costs.
(d) Reinstatement of Entitlements
If after any revision of annual entitlements and maximum annual entitlements pursuant to subdivision (c) of this article, circumstances arise which, in the judgment of the State, justify a revision upward of the same, the State shall, with the consent of the affected contractor, reinstate proportionately the previously reduced entitlements of such contractor to the extent deemed justified, and shall equitably redistribute the costs of the project transportation facilities if inequities would otherwise occur as a result of such reinstatement of entitlements.
(e) Advance Notice of Delivery Reductions
The State shall give the District written notice as far in advance as possible of any reduction in deliveries to it which is to be made under subdivision (a) of this article and, to the extent possible, shall give the District written notice five (5) years in advance of any reduction in its annual entitlements and maximum annual entitlement under subdivision (c) of this article. Reports submitted to the District pursuant to Article 16(c) may constitute such notices.
(f) No Liability for Shortages
Neither the State nor any of its officers, agents, or employees shall be liable for any damage, direct or indirect, arising from shortages in the amount of water to be made available for delivery to the District under this contract caused by drought, operation of area of origin statutes, or any other cause beyond its control.

20. Suspension of Service. In the event of any default by the District in the payment of any money required to be paid to the State hereunder, the State may, upon not less than six months' notice to the District, suspend deliveries of water under this contract for so long as such default continues: Provided, That during such period the District shall remain obligated to make all payments required under this contract. Action taken pursuant to this article shall not deprive the State of or limit any remedy provided by this contract or by law for the recovery of money due or which may become due under this contract.

21,33 Interruptible Water Service.
(a) Allocation of Interruptible Water
Each year from water sources available to the project, the State shall make available and allocate interruptible water to contractors in accordance with the procedure in Article 18(a). Allocations of interruptible water in any one year may not be carried over for delivery in a subsequent year, nor shall the delivery of interruptible water in any year impact a contractor's approved deliveries of annual entitlement or the contractor's allocation of water for the next
year. Deliveries of interruptible water in excess of a contractor's annual entitlement may be made if the deliveries do not adversely affect the State's delivery of annual entitlement to other contractors or adversely affect project operations. Any amounts of water owed to the District as of the date of this amendment pursuant to former Article 12(d), any contract provisions or letter agreements relating to wet weather water, and any Article 14(b) balances accumulated prior to 1995, are canceled. The State shall hereafter use its best efforts, in a manner that causes no adverse impacts upon other contractors or the project, to avoid adverse economic impacts due to a contractor's inability to take water during wet weather.
(b) Rates
For any interruptible water delivered pursuant to this article, contractors shall pay the State the same (including adjustments) for power resources (including on-aqueduct, off-
aqueduct, and any other power) incurred in the transportation of such water as if such
interruptible water were entitlement water, as well as all incremental operation, maintenance, and replacement costs, and any other incremental costs, as determined by the State. The State shall not include any administrative or contract preparation charge. Incremental costs shall mean those nonpower costs which would not be incurred if interruptible water were not scheduled for or delivered to the contractor. Only those contractors not participating in the repayment of the capital costs of a reach shall be required to pay any use of facilities charge for the delivery of interruptible water through that reach.
(c) Contracts
To obtain a supply of interruptible water, a contractor shall a execute a further contract with the State which shall be in conformity with this article and shall include at least provisions concerning the scheduling of deliveries of interruptible water and times and methods of payment.

24. Transportation Charge - Capital Cost Component.
(a) <Method of Computation> The capital cost component of the Transportation Charge shall be sufficient to return to the State those capital costs of the project transportation facilities necessary to deliver water to the contractor which are allocated to the contractor pursuant to subdivision (b) of this article. The amount of this component shall be determined in two steps as follows: (1) an allocation of capital costs to the contractor, and (2) computation of annual payment of such allocated capital costs and interest thereon, computed at the project interest rate and compounded annually, to be made by the contractor.
(b)40 <Allocation of Capital Costs Among Contractors> In the first step, the total amount of capital costs of each aqueduct reach to be returned to the State shall be allocated among all contractors entitled to delivery of project water from or through the reach by the proportionate use of facilities method of cost allocation and in accordance with (1) and (2) below. The measure of the proportionate use of each contractor of each reach shall be the average of the following two ratios: (i) the ratio of the contractor's maximum annual entitlement to be delivered from or through the reach to the total of the maximum annual entitlements of all contractors to be delivered from or through the reach from the year in which charges are to be paid through the end of the project repayment period and (ii) the ratio of the capacity provided in the reach for the transport and delivery of project water to the contractor to the total capacity provided in the reach for the transport and delivery of project water to all contractors served from or through the reach from the year in which charges are to be paid through the end of the project repayment period. Allocations of capital costs to the District pursuant hereto shall be on the basis of relevant values which will be set forth in Table B-141 of this contract by the State as soon as designs and cost estimates are prepared by it subsequent to receipt of requests from the District as to the maximum monthly delivery capability to be provided in each aqueduct reach of the project transportation facilities for the transport and delivery of project water to the District, pursuant to Article 17(a): Provided, That these values shall be subject to redetermination by the State in accordance with Article 28: Provided further, That the principles and procedures set

(1) The total amount of capital costs allocated to a contractor shall be the sum
of the products obtained when there is multiplied, for each aqueduct reach necessary to deliver water to the contractor, the total amount of the capital costs of the reach to be returned to the State under the Transportation Charge by the average of the two foregoing ratios for such reach as said average is set forth in the appropriate table included in its
contract.

(2) In the event that excess capacity is provided in any aqueduct reach for the purpose of making project water available in the future to an agency or agencies with which the State has not executed contracts at the time of any allocation of costs pursuant
to this subdivision, the prospective maximum annual entitlement or entitlements to be
supplied by such excess capacity, as determined by the State, shall be deemed to be contracted for by said agency or agencies for the purpose of such allocation of costs, to the end that the capital costs of providing such excess capacity are not charged to any contractor entitled by virtue of an executed contract to the delivery of project water from or through that aqueduct reach at the time of such allocation. Where additional capacity is provided in any aqueduct reach to compensate for loss of water due to evaporation, leakage, seepage, or other causes, or to compensate for scheduled outages for purposes of necessary investigation, inspection, maintenance, repair or replacement of the facilities of the project facilities, then, for the purpose of any allocation of costs pursuant to this subdivision: (i) the maximum annual entitlement to be delivered from or through the reach of each contractor entitled to delivery of project water from or through the reach shall be increased by an amount which bears the same proportion to the maximum annual delivery capability provided by such additional capacity that the contractor's maximum annual entitlement to be delivered from or through the reach bears to the total of the maximum annual entitlements to be delivered from or through the reach under all contracts; and (ii) the capacity provided in the reach for each contractor entitled to delivery of project water from or through the reach shall be increased in the same proportion that the contractor's maximum annual entitlement to be delivered from or through the reach is increased pursuant to (i) above.
(3) The projected amounts of capital costs to be allocated annually to the District under the capital cost component of the Transportation Charge shall be determined by the State in accordance with the cost allocation principles and procedures set forth in this subdivision, which principles and procedures shall be controlling as to allocations of capital costs to the District. Such amounts will be set forth in Table C by the State as soon as designs and cost estimates are prepared by it subsequent to receipt of

facility directly from funds other than bonds or borrowed funds, in lieu of such annual
principal and interest payments, the repayment of capital costs as to that part financed by such other funds shall be determined on the basis of the schedule that would have been
required under Article 24.
(2) The annual costs of off-aqueduct power facilities as computed in (1) above
shall initially be allocated among contractors in amounts which bear the same proportions
to the total amount of such power costs that the total estimated electrical energy (kilowatt hours) required to pump through project transportation facilities the desired delivery amounts of annual entitlements for that year, as submitted pursuant to Article 12(a)(1) and as may be modified by the State pursuant to Article 12(a)(2), bears to the total estimated electrical energy (kilowatt hours) required to pump all such amounts for all contractors through project transportation facilities for that year, all as determined by the State.

(3)49 An interim adjustment in the allocation of the power costs calculated in accordance with (2) above, may be made in May of each year based on April revisions in approved schedules of deliveries of project and nonproject water for contractors for such year. A further adjustment shall be made in the following year based on actual deliveries of project and nonproject water for contractors provided, however, in the event no deliveries are made through a pumping plant, the adjustments shall not be made for that year at that plant.
(4) To the extent the monies received or to be received by the State from all
contractors for off-aqueduct power costs in any year are determined by the State to be
less than the amount required to pay the off-aqueduct power costs in such year, the State may allocate and charge that amount of off-aqueduct power costs to the District and other contractors in the same manner as costs under the capital cost component of the Transportation Charge are allocated and charged. After that amount has been sO
allocated, charged and collected, the State shall provide a reallocation of the amounts allocated pursuant to this paragraph (4), such reallocation to be based on the allocations made pursuant to (2) and (3) above for that year, or in the event no such allocation was made for that year, on the last previous allocation made pursuant to (2) and (3) above.

26. Transportation Charge - Variable Operation, Maintenance, Power, and
Replacement Component.
(a) <Method of Computation> The variable operation, maintenance, power, and replacement component of the Transportation Charge shall return to the State those costs of the project transportation facilities necessary to deliver water to the contractor which constitute operation, maintenance, power and replacement costs incurred in an amount which is dependent
upon and varies with the amount of project water delivered to the contractor and which are
allocated to the contractor pursuant to (1) and (2) below: Provided, That to the extent permitted by law, the State may establish reserve funds to meet anticipated variable replacement costs; and deposits in such reserve funds by the State: (1) shall be made in such amounts that such reserve funds will be adequate to meet such anticipated costs as they are incurred, and (2) shall be deemed to be a part of the variable replacement costs for the year in which such deposits are made. The amount of this component shall be determined as follows:
(1) There shall be computed for each aqueduct reach of the project transportation facilities a charge per acre-foot of water which will return to the State the total projected variable operation, maintenance, power, and replacement costs of the reach for the respective year. This computation shall be made by dividing said total by the number of acre-feet of project water estimated to be delivered from or through the reach to all contractors during the year.
(2) The amount of the variable component shall be the product of the sum of the charges per acre-foot of water, determined under (1) above, for each aqueduct reach necessary to deliver water to the contractor, and the number of acre-feet of project water delivered to the contractor during the year: Provided, That when project water has been requested by a contractor and delivery thereof has been commenced by the State, and, through no fault of the State, such water is wasted as a result of failure or refusal by the contractor to accept delivery thereof, the amount of said variable component to be paid by such contractor during such period shall be the product of the above sum and the sum of the number of acre-feet of project water delivered to the contractor and the number of
acre-feet wasted.
(b) <Revenue from Aqueduet Power Recovery Plants> There shall be credited
against the amount of the variable component to be paid by each contractor, as determined
pursuant to subdivision (a) of this article, a portion of the projected net value of any power
recovered during the respective year at project aqueduct power recovery plants located upstream on the particular aqueduct from the delivery structures for delivery of project water to the contractor. Such portion shall be in an amount which bears the same proportion to said projected net value that the number of acre-feet of project water delivered to the contractor through said plants during the year bears to the number of acre-feet of project water delivered to all contractors through said plants during the year.
(c)52 <Payment Table> The amount to be paid each year by the District under the

(d) Exercise of Option
The option provided for in subdivision (b) above shall be exercised in writing on or before the January 1 due date of the first payment of the capital cost component of the Transportation Charge for the year in which the option is to become effective.
Such option, once having been exercised, shall be applicable for all of the remaining years of the project repayment period.
(e)56 <No Subtitle> Notwithstanding the provisions of Article 28(b), adjustments for prior overpayments and underpayments shall be repaid beginning in the year following the redetermination by application of a unit rate per acre-foot which, when paid for the projected portion of the District's annual entitlement will return to the State, during the project repayment period, together with interest thereon computed at the project interest rate and compounded annually, the full amount of the adjustments resulting from financing after January 1, 1987, from all bonds, advances, or loans listed in Article 1(s) except for Article 1(s) (3) and except for bonds issued by the State under the Central Valley Project Act after January 1, 1987 for facilities not listed among the water system facilities in Article 1(hh). Notwithstanding the immediately preceding exception, such amortization shall also apply to any adjustments in this component charge resulting from a change in the project interest rate due to any refunding after January 1, 1986 of bonds issued under the Central Valley Project Act. However, amortization of adjustments resulting from items 1(s)(4) through (7) shall be limited to a period which would allow the Department to repay the debt service on a current basis until such time as bonds are issued to reimburse the source of such funding. In no event shall this amortization period be greater than the project repayment period.
(f)57 Adjustment: Water System Revenue Bond Financing Costs
The use of water system revenue bonds for financing facilities listed in Article 1(hh) would result in adjustments for prior underpayments or overpayments of the capital cost component of the Transportation Charge to the District under the provisions of this article;
however, in place of making such adjustments, charges to the District will be governed by
Article 50.
29. Time and Method of Payment.

in which capital costs allocated to the respective contractor are first incurred by the State, subject
only to (1) through (4) below:
(1) The commencement of payment of the principal of such allocated costs may be
deferred up to a maximum of nine (9) years following the year in which such costs are first incurred by the State, to the extent that in the judgment of the State such delay in commencement of payment is necessary to prevent unreasonable financial hardship on the contractor.
(2) The payment of such principal and interest may be made, subject to approval by the State, in installments which vary in magnitude during the project repayment period.
(3) In the case of any contractor to which the delivery of project water for agricultural use as of 1990 is estimated by the State to be in excess of twenty-five percent (25%) of such contractor's maximum annual entitlement, payment of any portion or all of the capital costs allocated to such contractor which are attributed by the
State to agricultural use of project water, together with payment of interest on said capital costs, may be commenced by such contractor in the year of initial water delivery, to the extent that in the judgment of the State such delay in commencing payment is necessary to prevent unreasonable financial hardship on such
contractor.

(4) All unpaid interest shall be accumulated at the project interest rate, compounded
annually, and added to the contractor's allocated capital costs.
Notwithstanding (1) through (4) above, all contractors shall completely pay their total allocated capital costs and interest thereon, computed at the project interest rate and compounded annually, within the project repayment period, and payments under the schedule of payment of capital costs for each contractor, including interest over the project repayment period, shall have a present value, when discounted at the project interest rate to the first day of the project repayment period, equal to the present value of the payments under that schedule which would

47. 60 A mendatory Provisions.
(a)61 Surplus Water
Notwithstanding other provisions of this contract, surplus water for agricultural and ground water replenishment use shall be offered to contractors on the following basis. Before surplus water is sold for other than agricultural and ground water replenishment use, each contractor shall have the right, subject to the ability of the State to deliver such water and to the provisions of the next succeeding paragraph, to contract for agricultural and ground water replenishment use for a portion of the total amount of surplus water available in any year, in an amount which bears the same ratio to the total amount of surplus water available in that year as the sum of the annual entitlements, set forth in Table A of this contract, delivered to the contractor for agricultural and ground water replenishment use during the preceding three years bears to the total amount of such annual entitlements delivered for agricultural and ground water replenishment use during the preceding three years of all contractors requesting surplus water: Provided, That if its proportion of such surplus water is not required or cannot be delivered to any contractor, such amount of additional surplus water shall be offered to other contractors for agricultural and ground water replenishment use. During the first three years in which project water is delivered to a contractor, the State shall determine the amount of surplus water which the contractor may obtain based on the contractor's maximum annual
entitlement and the estimated percentage of its annual entitlement to be delivered for agricultural and ground water replenishment use; but quantities so determined shall not exceed the contractor's annual entitlement for that year. For the purpose of computing the portion of the surplus water for agricultural and ground water replenishment use to which each contractor is entitled, the State shall determine the amounts of water used for
agricultural and ground water replenishment use by each contractor in each year: Provided, That each contractor shall furnish certified copies of such records and data concerning the use of water within its boundaries as the State may request.
The provisions of this paragraph shall be applicable only to contractors in the San Joaquin Valley Service Area, contractors in the Southern California Service Area, and contractors in the Central Coastal Service Area. Before surplus water is sold for other
than agricultural and ground water replenishment use, each such contractor shall have the right, subject to the ability of the State to deliver such water, to contract for agricultural and ground water replenishment use in accordance with the following formula: contractors in the San Joaquin Valley Service Area shall have a right to contract for sixty- nine percent (69%) of the surplus water available at the Mile 18 Pumping Plant; contractors in the Southern California Service Area shall have a right to contract for
twenty-nine percent (29%) of such water; and contractors in the Central Coastal Service
Area shall have a right to contract for two percent (2%) of such water: Provided, That within each of these service areas, each contractor shall have the right to contract for
agricultural and ground water replenishment use for a portion of the total amount of

surplus water available to that service area in any year, in an amount which bears the same ratio to the total amount of surplus water available to the service area in that year as the sum of the annual entitlements, set forth in Table A of this contract, delivered to the
contractor for agricultural and ground water replenishment use during the preceding three years bears to the total amount of such annual entitlements delivered for agricultural and ground water replenishment use during the preceding three years of all contractors in that service area requesting surplus water: Provided, further, That if its proportion of such surplus water is not required by or cannot be delivered to any contractor, such amount of additional surplus water shall be offered to other contractors for agricultural and ground water replenishment use. During the first three years in which project water is delivered to a contractor, the State shall determine the amount of surplus water which the contractor may obtain based on the contractor's maximum annual entitlement and the
estimated percentage of its annual entitlement to be delivered for agricultural and ground water replenishment use; but quantities so determined shall not exceed the contractor's
annual entitlement for that year. As used in this paragraph, "contractors in the San
Joaquin Service Area" shall mean: Devil's Den Water District, Dudley Ridge Water District, Empire West Side Irrigation District, Hacienda Water District, Kern County Water Agency, and Tulare Lake Basin Water Storage District; "contractors in the Southern California Service Area" shall mean: Antelope Valley-East Kern Water Agency, City of West Covina, Coachella Valley County Water District, Crestline-Lake

Conservation District.
The provision of this paragraph shall be applicable only to a contractor to which the delivery of project water for municipal use as of 1990 is estimated by the State to be
in excess of fifty percent (50%) of such contractor's maximum annual entitlement. For
the purpose of fixing such contractor's right to delivery of surplus water, water from a watershed not tributary to the contractor's area which is delivered within the contactor's boundaries for agricultural or ground water replenishment use shall be deemed to be part of the contractor's annual entitlement delivered for such use in computing the quantity of surplus water to which the contractor is entitled under this subdivision: Provided, That
the contractor shall not be deemed to have used more than its annual entitlement, as set
forth in Table A, for such use. Surplus water shall be deemed to be used by the contractor for agricultural or ground water replenishment use if an equal quantity of water imported from a watershed not tributary to the contractor's area is delivered within the contractor's
boundaries for such use.
In providing for the delivery of surplus water to contractors pursuant to this subdivision, the State shall refuse to deliver such surplus water to any contractor to the extent that the State determines that such delivery would tend to encourage the
development of an economy within the area served by such contractor which would be

annual entitlement prior to 1978, the quantity of surplus water made available in any year prior to 1986 under this subdivision may exceed such difference by not more than 3,000 acre-feet.
Surplus water for agricultural and ground water replenishment use shall be furnished at prices which will return to the State the variable operation, maintenance, power and replacement components of the Delta Water Charge and Transportation Charge incurred in such service of surplus water as determined by the State. Surplus water delivered under this subdivision shall be limited to the quantity of water which can be delivered without adversely affecting the reliability, or increasing the cost, of service to meet annual entitlements. 62<Sentence deleted.> Contracts made pursuant to this subdivision may exceed one year in duration.
Except as herein modified, the provisions of Article 21 of this contract are
hereby confirmed, and all surplus water not specifically allocated pursuant to this subdivision shall be sold under the provisions of Article 21. Nothing in this
subdivision shall limit the right of the District to increase its annual entitlements as
otherwise provided in this contract.

For legal purposes, or when precise accuracy is required, users should direct their attention to original source documents rather than this integrated version.

(2) The State shall construct the Bast Branch Enlargement Facilities in stages, with the first stage providing the District in each reach at least fifty percent of the
capacity shown in the table set forth in Article 49(b)(1). The State shall determine the specific reach features to be enlarged in consultation with the Participating Contractors. All Participating Contractors which have capital cost repayment obligations in a reach shall be considered to have a minimum delivery capability in each stage. The minimum delivery capabilities of the Participating Contractors in each staged reach shall be in the
same proportion as the Participating Contractor's proportion of the total enlargement capacity. The State shall not construct Reach 26A of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities to a capacity greater than shown in the following table provided that power facilities may be constructed to a larger capacity if found by the State to be economically or operationally justifiable after prior consultation with the Participating Contractors.

REACH (1) CFS CAPACITY
26A 1,600

(3) The State shall make all reasonable efforts to complete construction of the
first stage of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities as specified above by July 1, 1991. If the State determines that construction of the first stage cannot be accomplished by July 1, 1991 without incurring extra costs, it shall consult it with the affected Participating Contractors.

(4) The State shall make all reasonable efforts to complete construction of any East Branch Enlargement Facilities necessary to accommodate the total of the constructed amount which are not completed as part of the first stage. It shall undertake
further construction activities upon the earliest of (1) the State's determination that delivery schedules submitted pursuant to Article 12 justify such action or (2) a request by The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California that such action be taken. If the State fails to complete construction of any portion or portions of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities one or more of the agencies may complete construction pursuant to the procedure in Article 17(f).
(5) Upon completion of each stage of construction, the State shall determine whether actual capacity of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities differs from contracted for capacity. If actual capacity differs from contracted for capacity, the capacity provided for transport and delivery of project water shall be proportionately adjusted by the State among the Participating Contractors.
(c) East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge
The payments to be made by each Participating Contractor entitled to delivery of project water from or through the East Branch Enlargement Facilities shall include an annual charge
under the designation East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge. This charge shall return to the State during the repayment period associated with financing of East Branch Enlargement Facilities, those costs of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities which are allocated to the Participating Contractor in accordance with the cost allocation principles and procedures hereinafter set forth. Wherever reference is made, in connection with the computation,

determination, or payment of the East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge, to the costs of any facility or facilities included in the System, such reference shall be only to those costs of such facility or facilities which are reimbursable by the Participating Contractors as determined by the State. The East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge shall consist of a capital cost component; and a minimum operation, maintenance, power, and replacement component, as these components are defined in and determined under Articles 49(d) and 49(e), respectively. For the purpose of allocations of costs pursuant to said articles, the East Branch Enlargement Facilities shall be segregated into aqueduct reaches as set forth in Figure B-5 in State Bulletin 132-85, provided, however, that Reach 23 may be adjusted after consultation with the contractors as a result of a delivery point for Mojave Water District being changed.
(d) East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge - Capital Cost Component
(1) Method of Computation.
Each Participating Contractor shall be allocated a capital cost component of the East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge which shall be sufficient to return to the State those capital costs of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities which are allocated to the Participating Contractor pursuant to subdivision (d)(2) of this article. The amount of this charge shall be determined by an allocation of capital costs to the Participating
a Contractor and a computation of annual payments of such allocated costs and interest, if any, thereon to be made by the Participating Contractor pursuant to this article. The capital costs allocated to the District shall be reduced by payments advanced by the District pursuant to Article 49(d)(4).
(2) Allocation of Capital Costs Among Participating Contractors.
The total amount of capital costs of each reach of the enlargement to be returned
to the State shall be allocated among all Participating Contractors on the basis of the ratio of the capacity provided in that reach of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities for the
transport and delivery of project water to the Participating Contractor to the total capacity provided in that reach of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities for the transport and delivery of project water to all Participating Contractors served from or through the
reach.

(3) Determination of Capital Cost Component.
The amount of this component shall be determined as follows:
(A) The total amount of capital costs allocated to a Participating Contractor shall be the sum of the products obtained when there is multiplied, for each enlargement reach, the total amount of the capital costs of the enlargement reach to be returned to the State under the capital cost component of the East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge by the ratio of the East Branch Enlargement capacity provided to make deliveries to the District in the reach in cubic feet per second (cfs), as provided in subarticle 49(b)(1), to the total cfs capacity of the reach of enlargement.
(B) The projected amounts of capital costs to be allocated annually to the District under the capital cost component of the East Branch Enlargement
Transportation Charge shall be determined by the State in accordance with the

cost allocation principles and procedures set forth in Article 49(d)(3)(A), which principles and procedures shall be controlling as to allocations of capital costs to the Participating Contractors. These amounts shall be subject to redetermination by the State in accordance with Article 49(g).
(4) Financing of Allocated Capital Costs by a Participating Contractor.
(A) The District may elect to pay a portion or all of the capital costs of the enlargement construction allocated to the District by furnishing funds to the State in advance of the State incurring the capital costs, provided that the total remaining costs to be financed by the State shall not be less than $50 million. The District may elect in writing to use this option by June 15 of each year as to any portion of an East Branch Enlargement Facility not yet funded by the State. If the District does not elect this option by June 15 of a given year, it may, with the consent of the State elect the option at a later time in that year.
(B) For any year in which the District elects this option, the State shall, on or before July furnish the District with a written statement of estimated
amounts of funds needed by the State in the succeeding year and of the calendar dates by which the State will need the funds. During each succeeding year the State shall, on the first of each month, notify the District of funds needed within the succeeding month. The District shall pay to the State the requested funds within fifteen calendar days of receipt of notification. The District may elect to advance funds to the State on an accelerated schedule acceptable to the State.
Unless otherwise agreed to by the District and the State, interest earned on any funds advanced pursuant to this paragraph shall be credited to reduce payments due from the District under this contract. To the extent practicable, interest earned shall be at the Surplus Money Investment Fund rate. The District may terminate its use of this option for a given year with the agreement of the State. If the District elects this option, subparagraphs (d)(5) and (d)(6) of this article shall not apply to any portion of capital costs to be paid pursuant to the option.
(C) If the District does not elect to pay all of the capital costs of the enlargement allocated to the District by furnishing funds to the State in advance,
the State, after consultation with the District, shall prepare a plan for the State's
financing of the East Branch Enlargement and shall give the District an opportunity to comment on the plan. The plan shall include but not be limited to the size of any revenue bond issuances and the form of necessary resolutions, articles and covenants.

(5) State Revenue Bond Financing of Allocated Capital Costs.
(A) Revenue Bond Charge
If the District does not pay all of the capital costs allocated to the District pursuant to subparagraph (3) and the State issues revenue bonds to finance the
enlargement construction, the portion of the capital costs not advanced pursuant to
subparagraph (4) shall be recovered through a Revenue Bond Charge. The
Revenue Bond Charges allocated to the Participating Contractors shall return to
the State an amount equal to the financing costs the State incurs for that portion of

the East Branch Enlargement Facilities constructed in whole or in part with funds
from revenue bonds (including revenue bond anticipation notes). The elements of the financing costs shall include but not be limited to bond marketing expenses to the extent not financed from the proceeds of applicable revenue bond sales,
interest expense during construction of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities to the extent not provided for from bond proceeds, annual premiums for insurance or other security obtained pursuant to Article 49(d)(5)(E), and all semi-annual East
Branch Enlargement Facilities revenue bond requirements including principal and interest and, to the extent not funded in advance of any proposed bond sale, or at any time following such: sale, in accordance with Articles 49(d)(5)(C) and 49(d)(5)(D), any additional requirements for coverage and deposits to reserves as required under applicable resolutions for the issuance of East Branch Enlargement Facilities revenue bonds. Any credits which shall include, but not be limited to,
interest earnings or other earnings of the State in connection with such bonds shall
when and as permitted by the bond resolution first be utilized for East Branch Enlargement Facilities construction purposes and thereafter all realized earnings shall be paid the Participating Contractors at least semi-annually. Such earnings
shall for the purpose of determining each non-defaulting Participating
Contractor's portion of any remaining capital costs be credited and paid to each non-defaulting Participating Contractor on the same basis that the capital costs were allocated to each Participating Contractor.
(B) Revenue Bond Charge Computation
The Revenue Bond Charge for the East Branch Enlargement construction payable by the District shall be computed as follows. The capital costs allocable to the District pursuant to Article 49(d) shall be determined. Any amounts paid by the District pursuant to Article 49(d)(4) shall be subtracted. The resulting difference shall be divided by the total of all capital costs to be financed by revenue bonds. The ratio resulting from the division shall be applied to each element of the total revenue bond financing costs. Until such time as the actual costs to be used in the foregoing computation are known, such computation shall
be based on estimates of such costs. The District's Revenue Bond Charge shall be
paid by the District semiannually at least 40 days before the State is required to
make the corresponding semi-annual payment to the bondholders.
(C) Excess Coverage
If the amount of coverage on any issue of revenue bonds, and interest
earned on the coverage, is in excess of that required under the applicable bond
resolution, articles or covenants, each participating contractor's share of the
excess shall be in the same proportion as charges were paid by each participating
contractor pursuant to Article 49(d)(5)(B) for the portion of the facilities financed by said issue of revenue bonds. When and as permitted by the terms of the bond
resolution, the share of excess coverage together with any realized interest earnings, shall at the Participating Contractor's option be returned to the Participating Contractor or be utilized to fund remaining East Branch Enlargement construction costs to the extent not otherwise provided for. To the

extent practicable, interest earned shall be at the Surplus Money Investment Fund
rate.

(D) Reserves
The State shall maintain revenue bond reserve funds no greater than necessary, as required under the applicable bond resolution, articles or covenants. In determining the level of revenue bond reserves to be maintained the State may, to the extent allowable under the applicable bond resolution, articles, or covenants, take account of any restricted reserve funds, other than replacement reserve funds, maintained by the individual Participating Contractors for the payment of State water contract payment obligations. Interest earned on revenue bond reserves maintained by the State and any excess reserve funds shall be credited promptly thereon to each Participating Contractor by the State. Upon retirement of any issue of revenue bonds and in accordance with the terms of the bond resolution, reserves maintained by the State on account of such issue, together with interest earnings thereon, shall be used to pay the final net annual debt service for such issue. Any reserves maintained by the State on account of an issue of revenue bonds and remaining after retirement of such issue, shall be repaid to the Participating Contractors in proportion to the total reserves that each Participating Contractor paid. To the extent practicable, interest earned shall be at the Surplus Money Investment Fund rate.
(E) Insurance
To the extent economically justifiable, as determined by the State after consultation with the Participating Contractors, the State shall obtain insurance or maintain other security protecting bondholders and Participating Contractors against costs resulting from the failure of any Participating Contractor to make the payments required by this Article 49(d)(5).
(6) State Non-Revenue Bond Financing of Allocated Capital Costs.
The State may use any of its available funds other than revenue bonds, to finance
all, or a portion of the capital costs of the enlargement construction. Until revenue bonds or other debt instruments are issued, the Participating Contractors shall pay interest at the Surplus Money Investment Fund rate on whatever funds are used. Any State debt
instrument other than revenue bonds or bond anticipation notes shall only be used after
consultation with the Participating Contractors.
(7) Reallocation of Costs.
No later than the date of completion of the first stage of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities, the State shall in consultation with the contractors participating in the repayment of the reaches, reallocate costs for Reach 24 (Silverwood Lake) and Reach 26A (South Portal San Bernardino Tunnel through Devil Canyon Powerplant). Such reallocation of costs shall apply to years beginning with the date of completion of
the first stage of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities. The State shall also reallocate at the same time the costs of Reach 25 (San Bernardino Tunnel) among all contractors participating in repayment of such reach, to reflect the redistribution of flow capacity

necessary for the East Branch Enlargement Facilities. Such reallocation shall include historical as well as future costs as appropriate. By the same date the State, in consultation with the contractors participating in the repayment of the reaches, shall also reallocate all costs associated with the work done pursuant to the letter agreement between the State and The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California dated November 29, 1966, as described in Subarticle 49(a)(1)(B).
(8) Allocation and Payment of Improvement Costs.
Using the procedure provided in Article 24 (Transportation Charge - Capital Cost Component) the State shall, as of the effective date of Article 49, allocate among all contractors entitled to delivery of project water from or through the affected reaches those design and construction costs encompassed in letter agreements dated January 18,
1984, July 2, 1984, and May 15, 1985, between the State and The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California which would have been incurred irrespective of East Branch Enlargement Facilities. The District shall pay the State the charges as determined pursuant to this provision with interest at the project interest rate.
(9) Charge for Increased Participation in Reach 25.
No later than the date of completion of the first stage of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities, the State shall reallocate the costs of Reach 25 to reflect capacity allocated to the District. The District shall pay such costs with interest at the project interest rate for any basic capacity and interest at 6 percent for any excess capacity. By the same time, all existing contractors in Reach 25 will receive credits with interest at
the project interest rate for any payments previously made by them with interest at the project interest rate, for basic capacity costs of Reach 25 to the extent those payments exceed the amounts they would have been obligated to pay if this amendment had been in effect as of the date funds were first paid. The values shown in Table B-1 and B-2 of State Bulletin 132 shall be appropriately adjusted.
(e) East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge - Minimum Operation,
Maintenance, Power, and Replacement Component
(1) The minimum operation, maintenance, power, and replacement
component of the East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge shall return to the
State those minimum operation, maintenance, power, and replacement costs which in the judgment of the State are incurred solely because of construction, operation and
maintenance of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities, and which are based on the
proportional capital cost allocation to the District for such enlargement facilities, by
reach. Other costs which cannot be attributed solely to East Branch facilities provided for pursuant to Article 17(a) shall be shared in accordance with a formula to be developed by the State in consultation with contractors participating in the repayment of the capital
costs of the affected reaches. The State may establish reserve funds to meet anticipated minimum replacement costs in the same manner provided for in Article 25(a).
(2) The total projected minimum operation, maintenance, power and replacement costs of each reach of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities for the
respective year shall be allocated among all Participating Contractors on the basis of the
ratio of the capacity provided in the East Branch Enlargement Facilities reach for the

transport and delivery of project water to each Participating Contractor to the total capacity provided in the East Branch Enlargement Facilities reach for the transport and delivery of project water to all Participating Contractors served from or through the
reach.

(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this article, or of Article 1(t), the costs of off-aqueduct power facilities associated with deliveries of water through East Branch Enlargement Facilities shall be included in the determinations and allocations pursuant to Article 25(d). There shall be no separate off- aqueduct power facilities determination and allocation for East Branch Enlargement
Facilities.

(f) East Branch Enlargement Variable Operation, Maintenance, Power, and
Replacement Costs
The variable operation, maintenance, power, and replacement costs associated with deliveries of water through East Branch Enlargement Facilities shall be included in the determinations and allocations pursuant to Article 26. There shall be no separate variable operation, maintenance, power, and replacement component of the East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge.
(g) Redetermination of Charges
(1) Determinative Factors Subject to Retroactive Charge
The State shall redetermine the values and amounts chargeable to Participating Contractors in 1988 or the year following the year in which this article is effective, whichever is later, and each year thereafter as needed in order that the East Branch
Enlargement charges to the District accurately reflect the increases or decreases from year to year in projected costs, properly attributable to each Participating Contractor. In addition, each such redetermination shall include an adjustment of the components of the charges to be paid by each Participating Contractor for succeeding years which shall account for the differences, if any, between those factors used by the State in determining the amounts of such components for all preceding years and the factors as then currently known by the State. Such adjustment shall be computed by the State and paid by the Participating Contractor or credited to the Participating Contractor's account in the manner described in Articles 49(g)(2) and 49(g)(3) below.
(2) Adjustment: East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge - Capital
Cost Component
Adjustments for prior underpayments or overpayments of the capital cost component of the East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge to the Participating Contractor, together with accrued interest charges or credits thereon computed at the then current Surplus Money Investment Fund rate on the amount of the underpayment or overpayment and compounded annually for the number of years from the year the underpayment or overpayment occurred to and including the year following the redetermination, shall be paid in the year following the redetermination.

For legal purposes, or when precise accuracy is required, users should direct their attention to original source documents rather than this integrated version.

One-twelfth of the adjustments for prior underpayments or overpayments of the Participating Contractor's minimum operation, power, and replacement component of the East Branch Enlargement Transportation Charge for each year shall be added or credited
and paid in the corresponding month of the year following the redetermination, together with accrued interest charges or credits thereon computed at the then current Surplus Money Investment Fund rate on the amount of the underpayment or overpayment and compounded annually for the number of years from the year when the underpayment or overpayment occurred to and including the year following the redetermination.
(h) East Branch Operation
Requests for delivery of water through the East Branch Enlargement Facilities shall be subject to Article 12. Except as otherwise provided, the East Branch Enlargement Facilities shall be operated as an integral part of the East Branch Aqueduct and shall be subject to the same criteria. To the extent that then-current deliveries involve rates of flow within the limitations of
Article 12(b) or involve capacities less than those on which the contractor's capital charges are based, the State shall provide the deliveries with no power peaking charges. To the extent
delivery capability is available to permit then-current deliveries at a rate of flow in excess of the lesser of that provided in (a) Article 12(b), or (b) of the sum of the capacities on which the
District's capital charges are based in the basic East Branch Aqueduct Facilities and the
District's proportional share of the operational capacity of the East Branch Enlargement Facilities, such deliveries will be allowed if such deliveries do not adversely affect the ability of other contractors to receive entitlement deliveries. However, if such excess deliveries would
cause increased power costs to any other contractors, the District shall pay the power costs that would otherwise increase power costs to the other water contractors. These power costs resulting from such excess deliveries will be based upon administrative cost allocation procedures adopted by the Director of the Department of Water Resources after consultation with the contractors. Before beginning deliveries that would involve extra power peaking charges, the State shall consult with the District to determine if the District desires (a) a change in its delivery schedule or (b) modifications in East Branch Aqueduct or Enlargement operation to avoid the increased
power costs.
(i) Failure to Meet Payment Obligations Under Article 49
(1) If a Participating Contractor defaults in payments due under Article 49 and the costs of other Participating Contractors would as a consequence be increased, the State shall, in addition to any actions taken pursuant to Articles 32 and 34, notify the defaulting Participating Contractor that if the Participating Contractor fails to cure the default within 30 days, the State will offer the capacity provided for the Participating Contractor to the other Participating Contractors. If the Participating Contractor fails to cure the default within thirty (30) days of notice by the State, the State shall offer to each Participating Contractor, in proportion to the contractor's degree of participation in the enlargement, the opportunity to assume responsibility for the capital charges and delivery capability on which the defaulting contractor's capital costs were based. If Participating Contractors fail to cure the default, The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California shall assume responsibility for the capital charges on which the defaulting contractor's capital costs were based, and shall receive the capacity associated with such
capital charges. Article 49(b)(1) shall be appropriately adjusted.

(2) No credits shall be assigned to a Participating Contractor under this article while the Participating Contractor is in default of any payment to the State under this article for a period of more than thirty (30) days.
50. 66Water System Revenue Bond Financing Costs.
(a) <Cost Provisions> Charges to the District for water system revenue bond financing costs shall be governed by provisions of this article. Charges to all contractors for water system revenue bond financing costs shall return to the State an amount equal to the annual financing costs the State incurs in that year for water system revenue bonds (including water system revenue bond anticipation notes). Annual financing costs shall include, but not be limited to, any annual principal and interest on water system revenue bonds plus any additional requirements for bond debt service coverage, deposits to reserves, and annual premiums for
insurance or other security obtained pursuant to subdivision (f) of this article. The State shall provide credits to the contractors for excess reserve funds, excess debt service coverage, interest, and other earnings of the State in connection with repayment of such revenue bond financing costs, when and as permitted by the bond resolution. When such credits are determined by the State to be available, such credits shall be promptly provided to the contractors and shall be in proportion to the payments under this article from each contractor. Reserves, bond debt service coverage, interest, and other earnings may be used in the last year to retire the bonds.
(b) <Annual Charges> Annual charges to recover water system revenue bond financing costs shall consist of two elements.
(1) The first element shall be an annual charge to the District for repayment of capital costs of water system facilities as determined under Articles 22 and 24 of this contract with interest at the project interest rate. For conservation facilities, the charge
shall be a part of the capital cost component of the Delta Water Charge in accordance
with Article 22. For transportation facilities, the charge shall be a part of the capital cost
component of the Transportation Charge in accordance with Article 24.
(2) The second element shall be the District's share of a Water System Revenue Bond Surcharge to be paid in lieu of a project interest rate adjustment. The total annual amount to be paid by all contractors under this element shall be the difference
between the total annual charges under the first element and the annual financing costs of
the water system revenue bonds. The amount to be paid by each contractor shall be
calculated annually as if the project interest rate were increased to the extent necessary to produce revenues from all contractors sufficient to pay such difference for that year. In making that calculation, adjustments in the District's Transportation capital cost
component charges for prior overpayments and underpayments shall be determined as if
amortized over the remaining years of the project repayment period.
(c) <District Invoice> The Water System Revenue Bond Surcharge will be identified
by component and charge in the District's invoice.
(d) Timing of Payments. Payments shall be made in accordance with Article 29(f) of this contract.

Disclimer: This document integrates San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District's State Water Project water supply contract and amendments to the contract entered into since December 30, 1960. It is intended only to provide a convenient reference source, and the Department of Water Resources 's unable to provide assurances that this integrated version accurately represents the original documents. For legal purposes, or when precise accuracy is required, users should direct their attention to original source documents rather than this integrated version.

(e) Reduction in Charges The Water System Revenue Bond Surcharge under Article 50(b)(2) shall cease for each series of water system revenue bonds when that series is fully repaid. However, the annual charge determined pursuant to Article 50(b)(1) shall continue to be collected for the time periods otherwise required under Articles 22 and 24.
After the Department has repaid the California Water Fund in full and after each series of
Water System Revenue Bonds is repaid, the Department will reduce the charges to all contractors in an equitable manner in a total amount that equals the amount of the charges under Article 50(b)(1) that the Department determines is not needed for future financing of facilities of the System which, in whole or in part, will serve the purposes of the water supply contract with the District.
(f) <Default Protection> To the extent economically feasible and justifiable, as determined by the State after consultation with contractors, the State shall maintain insurance or other forms of security protecting bondholders and non-defaulting contractors against costs resulting from the failure of any contractor to make the payments required by this article.
(g) <Bond Issuing Process> Before issuing each series of water system revenue bonds, the State shall consult with the contractors, prepare a plan for the State's future financing of water system facilities, and give the District an opportunity to comment on the plan. The plan shall include but not be limited to the size of any water system revenue bond issuances and the
form of any necessary resolutions or supplements.
(h) Defaults.

(1) If a contractor defaults partially or entirely on its payment obligations calculated under this article and sufficient insurance or other security protecting the non- defaulting contractors is not provided under Article 50(f), the State shall allocate a
portion of the default to each non-defaulting contractor. The District's share of the default shall be equal to an amount determined by multiplying the total default amount to be charged to all non-defaulting contractors by the ratio that the District's maximum Table A entitlement bears to the maximum Table A entitlements of all non-defaulting contractors. However, such amount shall not exceed in any year 25 percent of the Water System Revenue Bond financing costs that are otherwise payable by the District in that year. The amount of default to be charged to non-defaulting contractors shall be reduced by any receipts from insurance protecting non-defaulting contractors and bond debt service coverage from a prior year and available for such purpose.
(2) If a contractor defaults partially or entirely on its payment obligations under this article, the State shall also pursuant to Article 20, upon six months' notice to the defaulting contractor, suspend water deliveries under Article 20 to the defaulting contractor so long as the default continues. The suspension of water deliveries shall be proportional to the ratio of the default to the total water system revenue bond payments due from the defaulting contractor. However, the State may reduce, eliminate, or not commence suspension of deliveries pursuant to this subparagraph if it determines suspension in the amounts otherwise required is likely to impair the defaulting contractor's ability to avoid further defaults or that there would be insufficient water for human consumption, sanitation, and fire protection. The State may distribute the suspended water to the non-defaulting contractors on terms it determines to be equitable.

For legal purposes, or when precise accuracy is required, users should direct their attention to original source documents rather than this integrated version.

(3) During the period of default, credits otherwise due the defaulting contractor shall be applied to payments due from the defaulting contractor.
(4) Except as otherwise provided in Article 50(h)(3), the defaulting contractor shall repay the entire amount of the default to the State with interest compounded annually at the Surplus Money Investment Fund rate before water deliveries that had
been suspended shall be fully resumed to that contractor. If the defaulting contractor
makes a partial repayment of its default, the Department may provide a proportional restoration of suspended deliveries. The amount of the default to be repaid shall include any amounts previously received by the State from insurance proceeds, bond debt service coverage, or other reserves, and payments from other contractors pursuant to this subparagraph (h). The defaulting contractor shall not be entitled to any make-up water deliveries as compensation for any water deliveries suspended during the period when the contractor was in default.

(5) At such time as the default amount is repaid by the defaulting contractor, the non-defaulting contractors shall receive credits in proportion to their contributions towards the amount of the default with interest collected by the State on the defaulted
amount.

(6) In the event there is an increase in the amount a non-defaulting contractor contributes to reserves and/or bond debt service coverage, such increase shall be handled in the same manner as provided in Article 50(a).
(7) Action taken pursuant to this subarticle shall not deprive the State of or limit any remedy provided by this contract or by law for the recovery of money due or which may become due under this contract.
(i) Power of Termination.
(1) The Department and the District agree to negotiate in good faith the development of a means to provide adequate protection for the Department's cash flow into priorities one and two for revenues under Water Code Section 12937(b) with the goal of obtaining agreement by April 1, 1987. The Department and the District agree to continue negotiations beyond April 1, 1987 if necessary to meet their common goal of
arriving at agreement.
(2) If such an agreement has not been reached by April 1, 1987, and if the Director of Water Resources determines that adequate progress has not been made toward such an agreement, the Director may give notice to the District and other contractors that he intends to exercise the power to terminate provided in this subarticle 50(i). The Director's authority to give such a notice shall terminate on July 1, 1988.
(3) After six months from the date of issuing the notice of intent to terminate, but in no event later than January 1, 1989, the Director may terminate the authority of the Department to issue additional series of water system revenue bonds using the repayment provisions of Article 50. The Department shall promptly notify the District and other contractors that the Director has exercised the power of termination.
(4) No additional series of water system revenue bonds shall be issued under the provisions of this Article 50 after the Director has exercised the power to terminate,

51.68. FINANCIAL ADJUSTMENTS
(a) General Operating Account
(1) The State shall maintain a General Operating Account to provide the moneys needed to pay obligations incurred by the State of the types described in Water Code sections 12937(b)(1) and (2) in the event of emergency or cash flow shortages.
(2) An initial deposit of $15 million shall be made available from revenue
bond reserves that are no longer required by revenue bond covenants and that would
otherwise be credited to the contractors including the District. In 1998 or when the funds become available an additional $7.7 million will be deposited in the General
Operating Account from revenue bond reserves that are no longer required by revenue bond covenants and that would otherwise be credited to the contractors including the District, bringing the deposits to that account under this article to $22.7 million.
(3) The balance in the General Operating Account will increase pursuant to subdivision (e)(3)(v) of this article to an amount determined by the State but not in excess of $32 million. However, after the year 2001, the maximum amount of the fund may increase or decrease annually by not more than the same percentage as the increase or decrease in the charges, other than power charges for pumping water, to all the

contractors for the previous year from the charges for the year before that for obligations under subdivisions (c)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this article.
(b) State Water Facilities Capital Account
(1) The State shall establish a State Water Facilities Capital Account to be funded from revenues available under Water Code section 12937(b)(4). Through procedures described in this article and as limited by this article, the State may consider
as a revenue need under subdivision (c)(2)(v) of this article and may deposit in the State Water Facilities Capital Account the amounts necessary to pay capital costs of the State Water Facilities for which neither general obligation bond nor revenue bond proceeds are available, including but not limited to planning, reconnaissance and feasibility studies, the San Joaquin Valley Drainage Program and, through the year 2000, the CALFED Bay-Delta Program.
(2) The Director of the Department of Water Resources shall fully consult
with the contractors and consider any advice given prior to depositing funds into this account for any purposes. Deposits into this account shall not exceed the amounts specified in subdivision (c)(2)(v) of this article plus any amounts determined pursuant to subdivision (e)(1)(iii) of this article.
(3) The State shall use revenue bonds or other sources of moneys rather than
this account to finance the costs of construction of any major capital projects.
(c) Calculation of Financial Needs
(1) Each year the State shall calculate in accordance with the timing
provisions of Articles 29 and 31 the amounts that would have been charged (but for this article) to each contractor as provided in other provisions of this contract.
(2) Each year the State shall also establish its revenue needs for the following year for the following purposes, subject to the following limitations:
(i) The amount required to be collected under the provisions of this contract, other than this article, with respect to all revenue bonds issued by the State for Project Facilities.
(ii) The amount required for payment of the reasonable costs of the
annual maintenance and operation of the State Water Resources Development System and the replacement of any parts thereof as described in Water Code section 12937(b)(1). These costs shall not include operation and maintenance costs of any Federal Central Valley Project facilities constructed by the United States and acquired by the State of California after 1994, other than the State's share of the joint use facilities which include San Luis Reservoir, the San Luis Canal and related facilities.
(iii) The amount required for payment of the principal of and interest on the bonds issued pursuant to the Burns-Porter Act as described in Water Code
section 12937(b)(2).
(iv) Any amount required for transfer to the California Water Fund in
reimbursement as described in Water Code section 12937(b)(3) for funds utilized

from said fund for construction of the State Water Resources Development
System.
(v) For the years 1998 and thereafter, the amount needed for deposits into the State Water Facilities Capital Account as provided in subdivision (b) of this article, but (A) not more than $6 million per year for the years 1998, 1999 and 2000, and (B) not more than $4.5 million per year for the years 2001 and
thereafter.

(3) Subject to the provisions of subdivision (e) of this article, the State shall reduce the annual charges in the aggregate for all contractors by the amounts by which the hypothetical charges calculated pursuant to subdivision (c)(1) above exceed the revenue needs determined pursuant to subdivision (c)(2) above. The reductions under this article shall be apportioned among the contractors as provided in subdivisions (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this article. Reductions to contractors shall be used to reduce the payments due from the contractors on each January 1 and July 1; Provided, however, that to the extent
required pursuant to subdivision (h) of this article, each Agricultural Contractor shall pay to the Agricultural Rate Management Trust Fund an amount equal to the reduction allocated to such Agricultural Contractor. Any default in payment to the trust fund shall be subject to the same remedies as any default in payment to the State under this contract.
(4) The State may submit a supplemental billing to the District for the year in an amount not to exceed the amount of the prior reductions for such year under this article if necessary to meet unanticipated costs for purposes identified in Water Code section 12937(b)(1) and (2) for which the State can issue billings under other provisions of this contract. Any supplemental billing made to the District for these purposes shall be in the same proportion to the total supplemental billings to all contractors for these purposes as the prior reduction in charges to the District in that year bears to the total reductions in charges to all contractors in that year and shall be treated as reducing the amount of the reduction made available for that year to the District by the amount of the supplemental bill to the District.
(5) The State may also submit a supplemental billing to the District for the year if necessary to meet unanticipated costs for revenue bond debt service and coverage for which the State can issue a statement of charges under provisions of this contract
other than this article. The relative amounts of any supplemental billing made to the District and to other contractors for revenue bond purposes shall be governed by such other applicable provisions of this contract.
(6) Payment of any supplemental billing shall be due thirty days after the date of the invoice. Delinquency and interest on delinquent amounts due shall be governed by Article 32.
(d) Apportionment of Reductions between Agricultural and Urban Contractors
(1) Reductions available under this article are projected to begin to occur in 1997. The numbers and percentages in this subdivision reflect certain estimates of dollars and sharing of reductions. The actual reductions may vary slightly from the amounts described below. The State shall determine the availability of reductions for each year in accordance with this article.

For legal purposes, or when precise accuracy is required, users should direct their attention to original source documents rather than this integrated version.

(2) Reductions shall be phased in as follows:
(i) In 1997 reductions in the amount of $14 million are projected to be available and shall be applied as follows: the first $10 million of reductions shall be apportioned among the Agricultural Contractors, and the remaining reductions shall be apportioned among the Urban Contractors.
(ii) In 1998 reductions in the amount of $17 million are projected to be available and shall be applied as follows: the first $10 million of reductions shall be apportioned among the Agricultural Contractors, and the remaining reductions shall be apportioned among the Urban Contractors.
(iii) In 1999 reductions in the amount of $32 million are projected to be available and shall be applied as follows: the first $10 million of reductions shall be apportioned among the Agricultural Contractors, and the remaining reductions shall be apportioned among the Urban Contractors.
(iv) In 2000 reductions in the amount of $33 million are projected to be available and shall be applied as follows: the first $10 million of reductions shall
be apportioned among the Agricultural Contractors, and the remaining reductions
shall be apportioned among the Urban Contractors.
(3)
(i) In the event that the aggregate amount of reductions in any of the years 1997 through 2000 is less than the respective amount projected for such year in subdivision (d)(2) above, the shortfall shall be taken first from reductions that would have been provided to Urban Contractors. Only after all reductions to Urban Contractors have been eliminated in a given year shall the remaining shortfall be taken from reductions scheduled for Agricultural Contractors. Any projected reductions not made available due to such shortfalls in the years 1997 through 2000 shall be deferred with interest at the project interest rate to the earliest subsequent years when reductions in excess of those projected for those years are available. Such deferred reductions with interest at the project interest rate shall be applied to the charges of the contractors whose reductions have been
deferred.

(ii) In the event that the aggregate amount of reductions available in any of the years 1997 through 2000 is greater than the sum of (A) the respective amount projected for such year in subdivision (d)(2) above, plus (B) the amount of any shortfall with accrued interest at the project interest rate, remaining from any prior year to be applied, the excess shall be applied for the purposes and in the amounts per year described in subdivisions (e)(3)(iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) of this article, in that order.
(4) In 2001 and in each succeeding year reductions equal to or in excess of $40.5 million are projected to be available and shall be applied as follows:
(i) If reductions are available in an amount that equals or exceeds $40.5 million, $10 million of reductions shall be apportioned among the Agricultural Contractors, and $30.5 million of reductions shall be apportioned

among the Urban Contractors. If reductions are available in an amount greater than $40.5 million, the excess shall be applied as provided in subdivision (e)(3) of this article, subject however to subdivision (e)(1).
(ii) If reductions are available in an amount less than
$40.5 million in any of these years, the reductions shall be divided on a 24.7% - 75.3% basis between the Agricultural Contractors and the Urban Contractors respectively. Any such reductions not made due to shortages shall be applied without interest in the next year in which reductions in an amount in excess of $40.5 million are available pursuant to subdivision (e)(3) of this article with any remainder that is not available carried over without interest to be applied in the earliest subsequent years when reductions in excess of $40.5 million are available.
(5) Annual charges to a contractor shall only be reduced prospectively from and after the date it executes the Monterey Amendment to this contract. Apportionments of reductions shall be calculated on the assumption that all contractors have executed such amendment.
(e) Review of Financial Requirements
(1) In 2001 and every fifth year thereafter the Director of the Department of Water Resources, in full consultation with the contractors, will review the financial
requirements of the State Water Resources Development System and determine the following:
(i) The amount of revenues that are needed for State Water Resources
Development System purposes in addition to those needed for the purposes specified in subdivisions (c)(2)(i), (ii), (iii), and (iv) of this article;
(ii) If the aggregate amount that would have been charged to all contractors in any year but for this article exceeds the sum of (A) the
amount of revenues needed for the purposes specified in subdivisions (c)(2)(i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), plus (B) $40.5 million, plus (C) the amount determined pursuant to subdivision (c)(2)(v) of this article, the amount of such excess.
(iii) The amount of the excess determined in subdivision (e)(1)(ii) above that should be collected by the State for additional State Water Resources
Development System purposes and the amount of such excess that should be used
for further annual charge reductions.
(2) After making the determinations required above, the State may collect the revenues for additional State Water Resources Development System purposes in the amount determined pursuant to subdivision (e)(1)(iii) above.
(3) If and to the extent that as a result of such determinations, the aggregate amount to be charged to contractors is to be reduced by more than $40.5 million per year, the following priorities and limitations shall apply with respect to the application of such additional reductions:

(i) First, reductions shall be allocated to make up shortfalls in
reductions from those projected for the years 1997 through 2000 with interest at the project interest rate pursuant to subdivision (d)(3)(i).
(ii) Second, reductions shall be allocated to make up shortfalls in
reductions from those projected for the years beginning with 2001 without interest pursuant to subdivision (d)(4)(ii).
(iii) Third, additional reductions in the amount of $2 million per year shall be apportioned among the Urban Contractors until a total of $19.3 million in such additional reductions have been so applied.
(iv) Fourth, reductions up to an additional $2 million per year shall be allocated to make up any shortfalls in the annual reductions provided for in subdivision (e)(3)(iii).
(v) Fifth, $2 million per year shall be charged and collected by the State and deposited in the General Operating Account to bring the account
ultimately up to an amount determined by the State but not in excess of $32 million with adjustments as provided in subdivision (a) of this article. Any amount in the account in excess of this requirement shall be returned to general
project revenues.
(vi) Sixth, remaining amounts if any shall be used for reductions
divided on a 24.7% - 75.3% basis between the Agricultural Contractors and the Urban Contractors respectively.
(f) Apportionment of Reductions among Urban Contractors
Reductions in annual charges apportioned to Urban Contractors under subdivisions (d) and (e) of this article shall be further allocated among Urban Contractors pursuant to this subdivision. The amount of reduction of annual charges for each Urban Contractor shall be based on each Urban Contractor's proportionate share of total allocated capital costs as calculated
below, for both project conservation and project transportation facilities, repaid by all Urban Contractors over the project repayment period.
(1) The conservation capital cost component of the reduction allocation shall be apportioned on the basis of maximum annual entitlement. Each Urban Contractor's
proportionate share shall be the same as the percentage of that contractor's maximum
annual entitlement to the total of all Urban Contractors' maximum annual entitlements.
(2) The transportation capital cost component of the reduction allocation shall
be apportioned on the basis of transportation capital cost component repayment
obligations, including interest over the project repayment period. Each Urban Contractor's proportionate share shall be the same as the percentage that the contractor's total transportation capital cost component repayment obligation is of the total of all Urban Contractors' transportation capital cost component repayment obligations.
(i) Recalculations shall be made annually through the year 1999. Beginning in the year 2000 recalculations shall be made every five years unless an Urban Contractor requests a recalculation for an interim year and does so by a

request in writing delivered to the Department by January 1 of the year in which the recalculation is to take place.
(ii) The transportation capital cost component repayment obligations, for purposes of this Article 51(f), shall be based in the year of recalculation on the then most recent Department of Water Resources Bulletin 132, Table B-15,
"Capital Cost Component of Transportation Charge for Each Contractor," or its equivalent, excluding any costs or entitlement associated with transfers of entitlement from Agricultural Contractors pursuant to Article 53.
(3) To reflect the relative proportion of the conservation capital cost
component and the transportation capital cost component to the total of all capital cost repayment obligations, the two cost components shall be weighted as follows:
(i) The conservation capital cost component shall be weighted with a thirty percent (30%) factor. The weighting shall be accomplished by multiplying
each Urban Contractor's percentage of maximum annual entitlements as calculated in subdivision (f)(1) of this article by thirty percent (30%).
(ii) The transportation capital cost component shall be weighted with a
seventy percent (70%) factor. The weighting shall be accomplished by multiplying each Urban Contractor's percentage of transportation capital cost component repayment obligations as calculated in subdivision (f)(2) of this article by seventy percent (70%).
(ii) A total, weighted capital cost percentage shall be calculated for each Urban Contractor by adding the weighted conservation capital cost component percentage to their weighted transportation capital cost component
percentage.
(4) The total amount of the annual charges to be reduced to Urban Contractors
in each year shall be allocated among them by multiplying the total amount of annual charges to be reduced to the Urban Contractors by the total, weighted capital cost percentages for each such contractor. If the amount of the reduction to an Urban
Contractor is in excess of that contractor's payment obligation to the Department for that year, such excess shall be reallocated among the other Urban Contractors.
(5) In the case of a permanent transfer of urban entitlement. the proportionate
share of annual charge reductions associated with that entitlement shall be transferred
with the entitlement to the buying contractor. In the case of an entitlement transfer by either Santa Barbara County Flood Control and Water Conservation District or San Luis Obispo County Flood Control and Water Conservation District, the reductions in annual
charges to that agency shall be allocated (a) on the basis of that entitlement being retained
by that agency which bears Coastal Branch Phase II transportation costs, (b) on the basis
of that entitlement being retained by that agency which does not bear Coastal Branch Phase II transportation costs, and (c) on the basis of the balance of that agency's entitlement which also does not bear Coastal Branch Phase II transportation costs.

(g) Apportionment of Reductions Among Agricultural Contractors
(1) Reductions in annual charges apportioned to Agricultural Contractors under subdivisions (d) and (e) of this article shall be allocated among the Agricultural Contractors pursuant to this subdivision. The amount of reduction of annual charges for each Agricultural Contractor for the years 1997 through 2001 shall be based on each Agricultural Contractor's estimated proportionate share of the total project costs, excluding the variable operation, maintenance, power and replacement components of the Delta Water Charge and the Transportation Charge and also excluding off-aqueduct power charges, to be paid by all Agricultural Contractors for the years 1997 through 2035, calculated without taking into account this article. For purposes of these calculations, Kern County Water Agency's and Dudley Ridge Water District's estimated project costs shall not include any costs associated with the 45,000 acre-feet of annual entitlement being relinquished by those contractors pursuant to subdivision (i) of Article 53. Also, for purposes of these calculations, an Agricultural Contractor's estimated project costs shall not be reduced by the transfer of any of the 130, 000 acre-feet of annual entitlements provided for in subdivisions (a) through (i) of Article 53. The proportionate shares for 1997 through 2001 shall be calculated as follows:
(i) Bach Agricultural Contractor's statement of charges received on July 1, 1994, shall be the initial basis for calculating the proportionate shares for the five years 1997 through 2001.
(ii) Each Agricultural Contractor's estimated capital and minimum components of the Delta Water Charge and the Transportation Charge (excluding off-aqueduct power charges) and Water Revenue Bond Surcharge shall be totaled for the years 1997 through 2035.
(iii) Kern County Water Agency and Dudley Ridge Water District totaled costs shall be reduced for the 45,000 acre-feet of annual entitlement being
relinquished by them.
(iv) Any reductions in an Agricultural Contractor's totaled costs
resulting from the transfer of any of the 130,000 acre-feet of annual entitlement
shall be re-added to that contractor's costs.
(v) Each Agricultural Contractor's proportionate share shall be computed by dividing that contractor's total costs by the total costs for all Agricultural Contractors determined pursuant to subparagraphs (ii), (iii) and (iv) above.

(2) The reductions in annual charges, for 1997 through 2001, shall be calculated using the method described in subdivision (g)(1) of this article.
(3) The allocation shall be recalculated using the same method described in subdivision (g)(1) of this article every five years beginning in 2002, if any Agricultural Contractor requests such a recalculation. Any recalculation shall be based on project cost data beginning with the year that the recalculation is to become effective through 2035.

(h) Agricultural Rate Management Trust Fund
(1) Establishment. Through a trust agreement executed contemporaneously with this amendment, the State and the Agricultural Contractors that sign the Monterey Amendments shall establish the Agricultural Rate Management Trust Fund with a mutually agreed independent trustee.
(2) Separate Accounts. The trustee shall maintain within the trust fund a separate account for each Agricultural Contractor that signs the trust agreement to hold deposits made pursuant to this article.
(3) Deposits. Each Agricultural Contractor that signs the trust agreement shall deposit into such contractor's account within the trust fund, at the same time as payments would otherwise be required by this contract to be made to the State, an amount equal to the amount by which such contractor's charges under this contract have been reduced by reason of this article, until the balance in such contractor's account within the trust fund
is the same percentage of $150,000,000 as such contractor's percentage share of reductions made available to all Agricultural Contractors as specified in subdivision (g) of this article. In 2002 and every fifth year thereafter, the Agricultural Contractors will review the maximum accumulation in the trust fund (the "Cap") and determine whether the cap should be adjusted. However, the Cap shall not be reduced below an aggregate of $150,000,000 for all Agricultural Contractor accounts.
(4) Trust Fund Disbursements.
(i) In any year in which the State's allocation of water to an
Agricultural Contractor by April 15th of that year is less than one-hundred percent (100%) of the contractor's requested annual entitlement for that year, the trustee shall, to the extent there are funds in that contractor's account, distribute to the State from such account for the benefit of that contractor an amount equal to the percentage of the total of that contractor's statement of charges for that year, as redetermined by the State on or about May 15th of that year, for (a) the Delta Water Charge; (b) the capital cost and minimum operation, maintenance, power and replacement components of the Transportation Charge (including off- aqueduct power charges); and (c) the water system revenue bond surcharge, that is equal to the percentage of that contractor's annual entitlement for that year that was not allocated to it by the State by April 15th of that year.
(ii) In addition to the provisions of subdivision (h)(4)(i) of this article, if on April 15 of any year any of the irrigable land within the Tulare Lake Basin
Water Storage District (Tulare) is flooded, and Tulare in writing requests the trustee to do so, the trustee shall, to the extent there are funds in Tulare's account, distribute to the State from such account for the benefit of Tulare an amount equal to the percentage of the total of Tulare's statement of charges for that year, as redetermined by the State on or about May 15th of that year, for (a) the Delta Water Charge; (b) the capital cost and minimum components of the Transportation Charge (including off-aqueduct power charges); and (c) the water system revenue bond surcharge, that is equal to the percentage of the irrigable land within Tulare that is flooded on April 15.

For legal purposes, or when precise accuracy is required, users should direct their attention to original source documents rather than this integrated version.

(iii) Each Agricultural Contractor shall remain obligated to make payments to the State as required by other articles in this contract. Any amount to be disbursed pursuant to subdivisions (h)(4)(i) and (h)(4)(ii) shall be paid by the trustee to the State on July of the year involved and shall be credited by the State toward any amounts owed by such respective Agricultural Contractor to the State as of that date. However, an Agricultural Contractor may direct the trustee
to make the disbursement to that Agricultural Contractor which shall in turn make
the payment to the State as required by other provisions of this contract. If the amount to be disbursed exceeds the amount owed to the State by such contractor as of July 1, the excess shall be disbursed by the Trustee to the State at the time of
and in payment of future obligations owed to the State by such contractor.
Alternatively, upon the request of such contractor, all or part of the excess shall be paid by the trustee to that contractor in reimbursement of prior payments by the contractor to the State for that year.
(5) Payment of Supplemental Bills. In any year in which a supplemental bill has been submitted to an Agricultural Contractor pursuant to subdivision (c)(4) of this article, such supplemental bill shall be treated as reducing by an equal amount the
obligation of such contractor for that year to make payments into the Agricultural Rate Management Trust Fund. To the extent that such contractor has already made payments to the trust fund in an amount in excess of such contractor's reduced trust fund payment obligation, such contractor may request the trustee to use the excess from the trust fund to pay the supplemental bill.
(6) Discharge of Payment Obligation. Each payment to the State by the trust fund shall discharge and satisfy the Agricultural Contractor's obligation to pay the amount of such payment to the State. No reimbursement of the trust fund by the Agricultural Contractor for such payments shall be required. However, each Agricultural Contractor shall continue to make deposits to the trust fund matching the amount of each
year's reductions as provided in subdivision (d) of this article so long as the amount in that contractor's account is less than its share of the Cap.
(7) Distribution of Funds in Excess of the Cap. Whenever accumulated
funds (including interest) in an Agricultural Contractor's account in the trust fund exceed
that contractor's share of the Cap, or the estimated remaining payments the contractor is required to make to the State prior to the end of the project repayment period, that contractor may direct the trustee to pay such excess to the contractor.
(8) Termination of Trust Fund. At the end of the project repayment period,
the Agricultural Rate Management Trust Fund shall be terminated and any balances remaining in the accounts for each of the Agricultural Contractors shall be disbursed to the respective Agricultural Contractors.

(i) Definitions. For the purposes of this article, the following definitions will apply:

totaling 130,000 acre-feet of annual entitlements of the Agricultural Contractors and, to the extent provided in such contracts, rights in project transportation facilities related to such annual entitlement have been made to other contractors (the "Urban Contractors") or noncontractors in accordance with the provisions of this article. Such approval requirement shall apply to all contracts executed prior to January 1, 2011. KCWA shall be responsible for approval of such transfers for any portion of the 130,000 acre-feet not previously made available under this article by the other Agricultural Contractors. A contract between a willing buyer and a willing seller shall mean a contract between (1) t buyer which is an Urban Contractor or, to the extent provided in subdivision (e) of this article, a noncontractor and (2) a seller which is an is
Agricultural Contractor or a public entity which obtains project water from an Agricultural Contractor.
(b) <No Subtitle> The State shall not be obligated to approve any transfer of annual entitlements if in its judgment the transfer would impair the security of the State's bondholders and the State may impose conditions on any transfer as necessary to make the delivery of the water operationally feasible and to assure that the transportation costs associated with the transferred entitlement are fully repaid. Transfers not approved by the State shall not be
considered as part of the 130,000 acre-feet of annual entitlements provided for in this article.
(c) <No Subtitle> KCWA member units shall have 90 days to exercise a right of first refusal to purchase any annual entitlements being offered for sale to Urban Contractors by another KCWA member unit pursuant to this article, other than those annual entitlements made available to Urban Contractors by subdivision (d) of this article, by agreeing to pay the same

For legal purposes, or when precise accuracy is required, users should direct their attention to original source documents rather than this integrated version.

(3) To exercise the right of first refusal, an Urban Contractor shall deliver to the State and the seller its NOI within the time period stated in the Notice of Proposed Contract and shall proceed in good faith to try to complete the transfer to the Urban Contractor. Iftwo or more Urban Contractors deliver NOIs to the State, the amount of annual entitlement and transportation rights being sold shall be allocated among those Urban Contractors that are prepared to perform the purchase by the Performance Date
provided for herein in proportion to their maximum annual entitlements, or in another
manner acceptable to the Urban Contractors delivering the NOIs. An offer by an Urban
Contractor in its NOI to purchase less than the entire annual entitlement and
transportation right being transferred shall not be deemed to be an effective exercise of
the right of first refusal unless other Urban Contractors submit NOIs to purchase the remainder of the annual entitlement and transportation right or the noncontractor buyer agrees to purchase the remainder at the same unit price and on the same terms and conditions provided for in the Proposed Contract. The Performance Date shall be the date upon which the Urban Contractor is prepared to perform the purchase, which date shall be the later of: (1) 180 days after the delivery of the NOI or (2) the date set forth in the Proposed Contract for the noncontractor buyer to perform the purchase.
The Performance Date shall be extended at the request of the Urban Contractor if a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction is in effect as a result of a lawsuit a challenging the execution of the contract on the basis of noncompliance with the California Environmental Quality Act. Such extensions shall continue until five days
after the temporary restraining order or injunction expires or until the Urban Contractor requests it be discontinued, whichever occurs first. The Urban Contractor shall be liable for any damages suffered by the seller as a result of such extensions of the Performance
Date.
(4) If the seller and the noncontractor buyer under the Proposed Contract make any substantive changes in the Proposed Contract, such changes shall constitute a new Proposed Contract that cannot be performed without compliance with all of the procedures set forth in this article.
(5) If an Urban Contractor issuing a NOI fails to complete its exercise of the
Right of First Refusal by the Performance Date, the seller shall be free to sell its entitlement in substantial conformance with the terms and conditions set forth in the Proposed Contract. An Urban Contractor issuing a NOI may assign its rights to exercise a right of first refusal to another Urban Contractor and the assignee shall have the same rights as the assignor to complete the purchase by the Performance Date.
(6) In exercising the Right of First Refusal, an Urban Contractor, at its option,
may either agree to perform the Proposed Contract in its entirety, including all of its
terms and conditions, or agree to pay the price offered under the Proposed Contract for the annual entitlement and transportation rights without condition and without being
entitled to enforce or being subject to any other provisions of the Proposed Contract.
(e) <No Subtitle> As used in this article, "price" shall mean the dollar amount of
consideration provided for in the Proposed Contract.

(f) <No Subtitle> Upon the effective date of any such transfer, the seller shall be
relieved of and the buyer shall become liable to the State for all prospective Delta Water Charges, the related Transportation Charges and any other charges for the annual entitlements and associated transportation rights transferred unless the seller and buyer provide otherwise in
the contract for the transfer and the State approves such other provisions. However, the contractor making the sale shall remain obligated to the State to make the payments if the buyer defaults on its payments to the State related to the water transferred and is not a party to a long term water supply contract of the type contained in Department of Water Resources Bulletin Number 141. If the contractor making the sale is required to make any payments to the State as a result of the buyer's default, the entitlement transferred to the defaulting buyer shall, if provided for in the Proposed Contract, revert back to the contractor making the sale. The buyer may also be liable for any charges imposed pursuant to subdivision (g) of this article.
(g) <No Subtitle> A contractor which is a buyer of annual entitlement pursuant to this article may receive deliveries using any portion of the capacity previously provided by the State in each reach of the project transportation facilities for such contractor that is necessary for transporting the entitlement purchased by it on the same basis as any other entitlement provided
for in its Table A in effect prior to the date of the Monterey Amendment. Such contractor may also use any transportation rights transferred to it by a seller in the same manner as the seller was entitled to use them and any unused capacity in any of the reaches specified in this paragraph so long as project operations and/or priority of service of water to other contractors participating in repayment of capital costs in such reaches is not adversely affected. The State shall not be responsible for any resulting adverse impacts upon its ability to provide such contractor peaking capacity. The capital cost and minimum, operation, maintenance, power and replacement components of the Transportation Charge allocated to a buying contractor needing transportation capacity in excess of the capacity factors on which its charges are based in any reach shall be
determined prospectively based upon the increase in the buying contractor's annual entitlement resulting from the purchase, and service of water to fulfill annual entitlement to other contractors
shall not be impaired. The capital cost and minimum operation, maintenance, power and replacement components of the Transportation Charges shall then be reallocated among the other entities participating in repayment of costs of that reach. For the purposes of this determination, all payments received by the State from the seller relating to the annual entitlement sold shall be deemed to have been received from the buying contractor. Any increased Transportation minimum operation, maintenance, power and replacement component charges allocated to the buying contractor pursuant to this subdivision (g) 1 shall begin January 1 of the year following the effective date of the transfer.
(h) <No Subtitle> Individual contractors may transfer entitlements among themselves in amounts in addition to those otherwise provided for in this article. The State shall expeditiously execute any necessary documents and approve all contracts involving permanent sales of entitlements among contractors, including permanent sales among Urban Contractors. Such sales shall be subject to the provisions of subdivisions (b), (f) and (g) of this article; Provided, however, that for a buying contractor needing transportation capacity in excess of the capacity factors on which its charges are based in any reach, reallocation of the Transportation capital cost component charges for transfers other than (i) the 130,000 acre-feet provided for in this article and (ii) the approximate 33,000 acre-feet of transfers proposed from contractors

It is intended only to provide a convenient reference source, and the Department of Water Resources is unable to provide assurances that this integrated version accurately represents the original documents. For legal purposes, or when precise accuracy is required, users should direct their attention to original source documents rather than this integrated version.

The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, as the only contractor participating in repayment of Lake Perris, shall be allocated a Maximum Allocation at Lake Perris of 65,000 acre-feet based upon a proportionate use factor of 1.00000000.
The Maximum Allocation totals of 160,000 acre-feet and 65,000 acre-feet shall not be
subject to adjustment. The individual contractor's Maximum Allocations shall be adjusted only as agreed to among the contractors desiring to adjust their Maximum Allocations. Adjustments between the contractors shall be subject to approval of the State which approval shall be given unless there are adverse impacts upon another contractor participating in the reach which are unacceptable to such contractor. The participating contractors will, in consultation with the State, cooperate with each other in an effort to promote efficient utilization of Castaic Lake, and to minimize any adverse impacts to each other, through coordination of deliveries pursuant to other provisions of the State Water Contract as well as withdrawals of allocations pursuant to this
article.

(b) <No Subtitle>
The State shall operate Castaic and Perris Reservoirs as transportation facilities in a
manner consistent with this article. A contractor desiring to withdraw a portion or all of its Maximum Allocation shall furnish the State with a proposed delivery schedule. The proposed schedule may be submitted as part of the preliminary water delivery schedule submitted pursuant to Article 12(a)(1). Upon receipt of a schedule the State shall promptly review it to ensure that the amounts, times and rates of delivery will be consistent with the State's ability to operate the reach. The contractor may modify its proposed delivery schedule at any time, and the modified schedule shall be subject to review in the same manner. If necessary, the State may modify the schedule after consultation with the contractor and other contractors participating in repayment of that reach but may not change the total quantity of water to be withdrawn. As part of the consultation, the State shall advise a contractor if it determines a withdrawal will adversely impact the rate of delivery provided for the contractor in this contract. The-State shall not be responsible for any such impacts.
(c) <No Subtitle>
A contractor may withdraw all or a portion of its Maximum Allocation. It shall restore any withdrawn portion of such allocation by furnishing an equivalent amount of replacement water to the reservoir from which the water was withdrawn within five years from the year in which the withdrawal takes place. The unused portion of the allocation, in addition to any
replacement water furnished to the reservoir, shall remain available for subsequent withdrawal. The State shall keep an accounting of the contractor's storage withdrawals and replacements. In any year, the State shall permit a contractor to withdraw an amount equivalent to the contractor's Maximum Allocation minus remaining replacement water requirements due to previous withdrawals. If the contractor fails to schedule and replace the withdrawn water within the five- year return period, the State shall provide the replacement water from water scheduled for delivery to the contractor in the sixth year or as soon as possible thereafter. The total amount of scheduled annual entitlement which a contractor can use in any one year for restoring its Maximum Allocation and storing water in surface storage facilities outside of its service area pursuant to Article 56 shall be the sum of the maximum amount the contractor can add to storage that year pursuant to Article 56 and the amount of acre-feet shown in column 2 of the following table, depending on the State's final water supply allocation percentage as shown in column 1.

(d) <No Subtitle>
For any replacement water furnished to reservoir storage pursuant to this article, the responsible contractor shall pay the State charges for the conservation, if any, and transportation of such replacement water as are associated with the type of replacement water that is furnished, as if such water were delivered to the turnout at the reservoir to which the replacement water is furnished. Adjustments from estimated to actual costs shall be subject to provisions applicable to the type of replacement water. The State shall not charge contractors for water withdrawn pursuant to this article.
(e) <No Subtitle>
The State shall operate capacity in Castaic and Perris Reservoirs, not required for purposes of Maximum Allocation deliveries, in compliance with the requirement of Article 17(b) of The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California's water supply contract with the State to maintain an amount of water reasonably sufficient to meet emergency requirements of the contractors participating in repayment of that reach. A contractor receiving water pursuant to this article accepts that the State shall not be liable for any damage, direct or indirect, arising from
shortages in the amount of water to be made available from that reservoir to meet the
contractor's actual emergency requirements as a result of prior storage withdrawals by that contractor pursuant to this article. Nothing in this article shall permit or require the State to adjust allocations or deliveries under Article 18.
(f) <No Subtitle>
To the extent a contractor, during a calendar year, uses all or a portion of its Maximum Allocation, the State may, to the extent necessary to service project purposes, reduce that contractor's requested peaking service. Such reduction in peaking service shall only occur to the extent such usage of Maximum Allocation causes the State to be unable to provide all peaking service requested. This paragraph shall not apply to the extent the contractor requested usage of Maximum Allocation as part of the preliminary water delivery schedule submitted pursuant to Article 12(a)(1).
(g) <No Subtitle>
The State may reduce water stored in Castaic Lake and Lake Perris to the extent
necessary for maintenance and to respond to emergencies resulting from failure of project transportation facilities or of other supply importation facilities serving the State project service area. The State shall promptly replace water within the Maximum Allocation as soon as the need for the reduction terminates.
55.72 Transportation of Nonproject Water
(a) <No Subtitle> Subject to the delivery priorities in Article 12(f), contractors shall have the right to receive services from any of the project transportation facilities to transport water procured by them from nonproject sources for delivery to their service areas and to interim storage outside their service areas for later transport and delivery to their service areas: Provided, that except to the extent such limitation in Section 12931 of the Water Code be changed, a contractor shall not use the project transportation facilities under this option to transport water

storage in proportion to their annual entitlements designated in their Table A's for that year. If such reallocation results in the need to displace water from the storage balance for any contractor or noncontractor, the water to be displaced shall be displaced in the following order of priority:
First, water, if any, stored for noncontractors.
Second, water stored for a contractor that previously was in excess of that
contractor's allocation of storage capacity.
Third, water stored for contractor that previously was within that contractor's
allocated storage capacity.
The State shall give as much notice as feasible of a potential displacement.
(4) Any contractor electing to store project water outside its service area pursuant to this subdivision may not sell project water during the year in which it elected
to store project water. This limitation shall not apply to replacement water furnished to Castaic and Perris Reservoirs pursuant to Article 54, nor to the storage of water introduced into a groundwater basin outside a contractor's service area if recovery is intended to occur within that contractor's service area.
(5) The restrictions on storage of project water outside a contractor's service area provided for in this subdivision (c), shall not apply to storage in any project offstream storage facilities constructed south of the Delta after the date of this
amendment.
(6) For any project water stored outside its service area pursuant to this subdivision (c), a contractor shall pay the State the same (including adjustments) for power resources (including on-aqueduct, off-aqueduct, and any other power) incurred in the transportation of such water as the contractor pays for the transportation of annual entitlement to the reach of the project transportation facility from which the water is delivered to storage. If annual entitlement is stored, the Delta Water Charge shall be charged only in the year of delivery to interim storage. For any stored water returned to a project transportation facility for final delivery to its service area, the contractor shall pay the State the same for power resources (including on-aqueduct, off-aqueduct, and any
other power) incurred in the transportation of such water calculated from the point of
return to the aqueduct to the turn-out in the contractor's service area. In addition, the
contractor shall pay all incremental operation, maintenance, and replacement costs, and any other incremental costs, as determined by the State, which shall not include any administrative or contract preparation charge. Incremental costs shall mean those nonpower costs which would not be incurred if such water were scheduled for or delivered to the contractor's service area instead of to interim storage outside the service
area. Only those contractors not participating in the repayment of a reach shall be required to pay a use of facilities charge for use of a reach for the delivery of water to, or return of water from, interim storage.
(7) A contractor electing to store project water in a nonproject facility within the service area of another contractor shall execute a contract with that other contractor
prior to storing such water which shall be in conformity with this article and will include

<Only would apply if condition in Article 50(i)(5) met.>

Article 1(r) is amended to read:
(r) Project Interest Rate "Project interest rate" shall mean the weighted average interest rate of (1) through (6) below computed by dividing (i) the total interest cost required to be paid or credited by the State during the life of the indebtedness or advance by (ii) the total of the products of the various
principal amounts and the respective terms in years of all such amounts:
2 general obligation bonds issued by the State under the Bond Act, revenue bonds issued by the State under the Central Valley Project Act after May 1, 1969,
(3) bonds issued by the State under any other authority granted by the Legislature or
the voters,
(4) bonds issued by any agency, district, political subdivision, public corporation, or nonprofit corporation of this State,

have if resulted if the contractor had sold bonds for the purpose of funding the advance, as determined by the State, and
(6) funds borrowed from the General Fund or other funds in the Treasury of the State of California, for which the total interest cost shall be computed at the
interest rate earned over the period of such borrowing by moneys in the Pooled Money Investment Account of such Treasury invested in securities, to the extent
the proceeds of any such bonds, advances or loans are for construction of the
State Water Facilities defined in Section 12934(d) of the Water Code, the additional project conservation facilities, and the supplemental conservation facilities, (except off-aqueduct power facilities and advances for delivery structures, measuring devices and excess capacity) and without regard to any premiums received on the sale of bonds under item (1) above. The "project interest rate" shall be computed as a decimal fraction to five places.
