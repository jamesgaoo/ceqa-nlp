INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner CENTRAL DELTA WATER AGENCY (CDWA" or "Petitioner")

3 petitions this Court for a Writ of Mandate ("Petition"), directed to Defendant CALIFORNIA
4 DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES ("DWR" or "Respondent"). Petitioner challenges
5 DWR's certification of the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Lookout Slough Tidal

6 Habitat Restoration and Flood Improvement Project ("project"). The United States Fish and
7 Wildlife Service ("USFWS") and the National Marine Fisheries Service ("NMFS") issued
8 biological opinions ("BiOps") in 2008 and 2009, respectively with regard to Delta Smelt and

9 salmonids for the long-term coordinated operations of the State Water Project ("SWP") and the
10 federal Central Valley Project ("CVP"). Under Reasonable and Prudent Alternative ("RPA") 4
11 of the 2008 USFWS Delta Smelt BiOp, DWR must restore 8,000 acres of tidal marsh complex
12 in the Delta to provide habitat for the species. The project proposes to restore approximately
13 3,164 acres of tidal marsh that would create habitat for Delta Smelt and other fish and wildlife

14 species. Water Code section 11912 requires that the SWP costs for preservation of fish and
15 wildlife be borne by the SWP contractors. Levee modifications, grading, placement of fill
16 material, and revegetation would be used to restore and enhance upland, tidal, subtidal, and
17 floodplain habitat designed to perform a range of habitat functions for the target species, as well
18 as other special-status species such as giant garter snake (Thamnophis gigas). In addition to
19 helping to satisfy DWR's obligations under RPA 4, the project is designed to be consistent with
20 RPA I.6.1 (Restoration of Floodplain Rearing Habitat) of the 2009 NMFS Salmonid BiOp.
21 2. While restoration activities can be beneficial, impacts on the environment and
22 adjacent/regional land and water uses must be fully disclosed and adequately mitigated. (Pub.
23 Resources Code, § 21000 et seq. (California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") and the
24 CEQA Guidelines (14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15000 et seq.) Responsible restoration projects
25 honestly disclose and mitigate project-level and regional cumulative impacts. This project is
26 proposed in the context of thousands of acres of restoration, and many other existing and
27 planned activities. Without the disclosure required by CEQA, decisionmakers and the public
28 cannot make informed decisions about management of Delta lands, waters and other resources.

P When these impacts are obscured in the CEQA process, the parties most impacted are the
2 neighbors, and other water and land uses connected by the maze of Delta waterways.
3 Restoration projects that make good neighbors engender support for more restoration and
4 partnerships with the local community.

5 3. In certifying the EIR and approving the project for Lookout Slough, DWR
6 prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in the manner require by law, and failed
7 to comply with the substantive and procedural mandates of CEQA, and other applicable
8 regulations and policies.
9 4. The conclusions reached in the EIR --particularly that the project would result in
10 no significant impacts-are not supported by substantial evidence. The EIR does not provide
11 adequate analysis of, or identify adequate mitigation measures for, the project's individual and
12 cumulative impacts, including but not limited to, impacts on hydrology, water quality, flooding,
13 water supply, biological resources, agricultural resources, land use, transportation, and
14 cumulative impacts. DWR also failed to provide a stable and finite project description,
15 adequately analyze project alternatives, or adequately discuss other permitting requirements.
16 5. Because DWR prejudicially abused its discretion and failed to proceed in a
17 manner required by law, Petitioner requests that the Court direct DWR to set aside its actions to
18 approve the project and certify the EIR.

19 PARTIES

20 6. Petitioner CDWA is a political subdivision of the State of California created by
21 the California Legislature under the Central Delta Water Agency Act, chapter 1133 of the
22 statutes of 1973 (Wat. Code, Appendix, 117-1.1, et seq.), by the provisions of which CDWA
23 came into existence in January of 1974. CDWA's boundaries are specified in Water Code
24 Appendix section 117-9.1 and encompass approximately 120,000 acres, which are located
25 entirely within both the western portion of San Joaquin County and the "Sacramento-San
26 Joaquin Delta" as defined in California Water Code section 12220. While the lands within the

27 agency are primarily devoted to agriculture, said lands are also devoted to numerous other uses
28 including recreational, wildlife habitat, open space, residential, commercial, and institutional

SOLURI 3 MESERVE

-

2 uses. CDWA is empowered to "sue and be sued" and to take all reasonable and lawful actions,

3 including pursuing legislative and legal action, that have for their general purpose: (1) to protect

4 the water supply of the lands within the agency against intrusion of ocean salinity; and/or (2) to

5 a assure the lands within the agency a dependable supply of water of suitable quality sufficient to

6 meet present and future needs. The agency may also undertake activities to assist landowners

7 and local districts within the agency in reclamation and flood control matters. (See Wat. Code,

8 Appendix, 117-4.3, subd. (b) & 117-4.1, subds. (a) and (b), respectively.) CDWA may assist

9 landowners, districts, and water right holders within its boundaries in the protection of their

10 vested water rights and may represent the interests of those parties in water right proceedings

11 and related proceedings before courts of both the State of California and the United States to

12 carry out the purposes of the agency. (See Wat. Code, Appendix, 117-4.2, subd. (b).) Those
vested water rights include post-1914 water permits and licenses issued by the SWRCB and its
13 predecessor agencies, overlying rights, statutory rights, contract rights, riparian rights,
14

15 prescriptive rights, salvage rights, rights to recycled and recaptured water, and rights to artesian
flow.

16 7.

17 Defendant CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES ("DWR")
is an agency of the State of California located in Sacramento, California. DWR is the project's
18 lead agency under CEQA. DWR was established in 1956 for the purpose of building and
19 operating the SWP. In addition to operating the SWP, DWR's major responsibilities include
20 overseeing the statewide process of developing and updating the California Water Plan (Bulletin
21

22 160 series), undertaking restoration in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta according to its permit

23 terms, regulating dams, providing flood protection, assisting in emergency management, and
allocation of certain bond funds. DWR's role as operator of the SWP conflicts with its public
24  trust obligations related to its other major responsibilities. Such is the case in this matter.
25 8. Petitioner is informed and believes that Real Party in Interest Ecosystem
26 Investment Partners, LLC ("EIP" or "Real Party in Interest"), a is a Delaware limited-liability
27

28 company doing business in California. EIP was identified as the project Applicant in the draft

F EIR ("DEIR"), and as the current owner of the proposed project property in the final EIR
2 ("FEIR").

3 9. Does 1 through 50 are persons or entities unknown to Petitioner at this time who

4 may be necessary parties to this action. Petitioner is informed and believe, and based thereon

5 alleges, that each of the Does may have a legal interest in the outcome of these proceedings.

6 Petitioner will amend this Petition specifically to identify each such person or entity, if and
7 when their identities become known.

8 FACTUAL BACKGROUND

9 The Project and Project Setting
10 10. The Lookout Slough project Site is an approximately 3,400-acre area located in
11 unincorporated Solano County, California, with a small portion of the project site extending into
12 unincorporated Yolo County (Figure III-1). The project Site is approximately 20 miles
13 southwest of Sacramento and 50 miles northeast of San Francisco. It is bounded by Liberty
14 Island Road on the north, Cache and Hass Sloughs on the south, Duck Slough on the west, and
15 Shag Slough on the east.
16 Environmental Review of the Project
17 11. On or about March 21, 2019, DWR filed a Notice of Preparation ("NOP") and
18 Initial Study with the State Clearinghouse (SCH No. 2019039136).
19 12. On April 22, 2019, Petitioner submitted a comment letter to DWR regarding the
20 NOP, along with numerous other commentors.
21 13. DWR released the DEIR for public review on December 16, 2019. Petitioner
22 submitted comments on the DEIR on February 14, 2020. Comments by Petitioner document
23 substantive and procedural flaws present in the DEIR, as well as the project's undisclosed,
24 unanalyzed, and unmitigated potentially significant impacts. Numerous other local entities, state
25 agencies, and other groups also provided comments on the project during the public review
26 period.

- 27.

2 DWR released the FEIR for the Project in October 2020. The FEIR failed to

3 adequately address Petitioner's concerns, or the concerns raised in comments made by other

4 members of the public, and failed to comply with CEQA in a variety of respects.
28.

5 29. On or about November 2, 2020, DWR certified the EIR and approved the Project.

6 On or about November 3, 2020, DWR filed a Notice of Determination ("NOD")
for the project. The NOD states that the Project will a not have a significant effect on the
7 environment, that mitigation measures were included as a condition of approval of the project,
8 that a mitigation reporting or monitoring plan was adopted, that findings were made pursuant to
9 CEQA, and that a statement of overriding considerations was not adopted.
10 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

11 14.

12 This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged in this Petition pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5,
13 21168.7, and 21168.9.

14 15.

15 This Court also has jurisdiction under Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 527,

16 and 1094.5(g) to enjoin and stay DWR and Real Party in Interest from proceeding with any

17 further approvals, disbursement of funding, or commencement of construction activities related
to the project.

18 16.

19 Venue is proper in Solano County Superior Court under section 393 of the Code of
Civil Procedure, because some part of the project will be constructed in Solano County and will
20 have a direct and substantial effect on the environment and persons in that county.
21 17. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section
22 21167, subdivision (b) and CEQA Guidelines section 15112, as well as Code of Civil Procedure
23 section 1094.5.

24

25 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

18.

26 Petitioner has exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law.
Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to this filing and participated in the
27 administrative process. Petitioner actively participated in the administrative process leading up

2 to DWR's approval of the project and issuance of the NOD, and stated its objections to DWR's
actions. (See Pub. Resources Code, § 21177, subd. (b).)

3 19.

4 DWR has taken final agency actions with respect to certifying the EIR and

5 approving the project. DWR has a mandatory duty to comply with all state and federal laws,

6 including but not limited to CEQA, prior to undertaking the discretionary actions at issue in this
lawsuit.

7 STANDING

20. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims alleged in this Petition because it is
9 beneficially interested in this matter, as required by Code of Civil Procedure section 1086.
10

11 Petitioner is a water agency located within the Delta and will be directly and indirectly
impacted by the project. Petitioner's interests have been, are being, and will continue to be
12 adversely affected by DWR's failure to comply with applicable laws, and by the proposed
13

14 project's negative impacts to environmental resources including, but not limited to, surface
water quality and flood control infrastructure. Unless the relief requested herein is granted, the
15 environment will be adversely affected and injured by the DWR's failure to comply with
16 CEQA in approving the project and certifying the EIR.
17 21. Petitioner also actively participated in the administrative process conducted by
18 DWR to determine the project's environmental impacts and to ensure DWR complied with
19

20 CEQA and all other applicable laws in processing the application for the project.
22.

21 Petitioner has no other adequate remedy at law, and brings this action on behalf of
its adversely affected water users and landowners.
22 IRREPARABLE HARM
23 23.

24 DWR's failures, set forth in this Petition, constitute a prejudicial abuse of

25 discretion within the meaning of the Code of Civil Procedure and CEQA. (See Code Civ. Proc.,
§1094.5; Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.)
26 24.

27 Petitioner possesses no other remedy than to challenge the DWR's abuse of

28 discretion other than by means of this lawsuit. If DWR's actions concerning the project are

SOLURI
MESERVE
ALAW 7

CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

effectuated, Petitioner, its landowners, water users and the environment will be irreparably
2 harmed. No money damages could adequately compensate for that harm.
3 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

4 25. Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil
5 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights
6 affecting the public interest.

7 26. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit on
8 the general public by requiring DWR to carry out its duties under CEQA before approving the
9 project.
10 27. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will also result in the enforcement
11 of important rights affecting the public interest by compelling DWR to engage in a fair, a
12 objective, and legally adequate analysis of the project's environmental impacts, and to ensure
13 that the a public has a meaningful opportunity to review and comment on these impacts and
14 mitigation measures for that project. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are
15 such as to make an award of attorney's fees appropriate in this case. Absent enforcement by
16 CDWA, DWR will proceed with a project that will cause significant, unmitigated environmental
17 impacts that might otherwise have been reduced or avoided through legally adequate
18 environmental review and the adoption of feasible mitigation measures.
19 NOTICE OF CEQA SUIT

20 28. On December 3, 2020, CDWA served a notice of Petitioner's intent to file this

21 lawsuit, pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5. (See Exhibit A, Notice of
22 Commencement of Action against the Department of Water Resources.)
23 REQUEST TO PREPARE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD
24 29. Pursuant to Public Resources Code, section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), and any
25 other applicable authority, CDWA elects to prepare the record of proceedings in this action.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

2 Violations of CEQA (Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)
3 30. Petitioner incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in
4 Paragraphs 1 through 29 as though fully set forth herein.

5 31. CEQA prohibits local agencies from approving projects that may have adverse

6 environmental impacts without first adequately disclosing and analyzing those impacts. An EIR
7 is an informational document that must disclose any potentially significant environmental
8 impacts of the project and inform decision-makers and the public of mitigation measures and
9 alternatives to the project that would avoid or substantially lessen those impacts. (Pub.
10 Resources Code, § 21061; CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.6, 15370.)
11 32. Under section 15088.5 of the CEQA Guidelines, recirculation of an EIR is
12 required when "significant new information" is added to the EIR after public review but prior to
13 certification of the FEIR. The term "information" can include changes in the project or
14 environmental setting, as well as additional data or other information. "Significant new
15 information" requiring recirculation may include a disclosure showing that new or more severe
16 significant impacts would result, that feasible mitigation that would address impacts is not being
17 adopted, or that the EIR was SO fundamentally and basically inadequate and conclusory in nature
18 that meaningful public review and comment were precluded.
19 33. DWR prejudicially abused its discretion in certifying the EIR. DWR did not
20 proceed in the manner required by law and its decisions in approving the project and certifying
21 the EIR are not supported by substantial evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.5; Vineyard
22 Area Citizens for Responsible Growth v. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 426.)
23 These legal deficiencies include, without limitation, the following:
24 The EIR Fails to Adequately Define the Project's Baseline
25 34. In order to determine whether a project's impacts will be significant, CEQA
26 requires lead agencies to compare the impact of a proposed project to the "physical
27 environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project, as they exist at the time the notice of
28 preparation is published." These conditions serve as the project's "baseline." (CEQA

SOLURI
MESERVE 9
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

Guidelines, § 15125.) The description of the project's baseline ensures that the public has "an
2 understanding of the significant effects of the proposed project and its alternatives." (CEQA

3 Guidelines § 15125, subd. (a). Accurately determining the baseline environmental conditions is
4 crucial to accurately evaluating a project's impact. (E.g., San Joaquin Raptor/Wildlife Rescue
5 Ctr. v. County of Stanislaus (1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 713, 722-723.) The EIR failed to evaluate
6 the comparative merits of the alternatives a in a manner that was reasonably calculated to inform
7 the public.

8 35. The EIR's description of baseline conditions is alternatively incomplete and
9 inaccurate, infecting and invalidating the entirety of the EIR's environmental analysis.
10 36. The EIR fails to comply with the requirement that the baseline must be "realistic"
11 and give the "most accurate picture possible" of the project's likely impacts. (Neighbors for
12 Smart Rail v. Exposition Metro Line Const. Authority (2013) 57 Cal.4th 439, 507.) Here the
13 baseline fails to meet the required standard of realism and accuracy.
14 37. As one example of inadequate setting information, the failure to include a full

15 range of water years and climactic conditions in the water quality modeling prevented a
16 meaningful comparison to modeled with project conditions.
17 The Project Description Is Vague, Incomplete, and Unstable
18 38. CEQA requires that an EIR include an accurate project description, and that the
19 nature and objective of a project be fully disclosed and fairly evaluated in an EIR. (San Joaquin
20 | Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 646, 655.) An EIR should
21 contain a "sufficient degree of analysis to provide decision-makers with information which
22 enables them to make a decision which intelligently takes account of environmental
23 consequences." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15151.)
24 39. The EIR's project description is deficient because it lacks adequate specificity
25 required to analyze project impacts, is shifting and unstable, and fails to include the whole of the

26 project.
27 ///
28 ///

SOLURI
MESERVE 10
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

The EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze Project Alternatives

2 40. The EIR failed to include an adequate analysis of project alternatives, or a
3 reasonable range of project alternatives. A project alternative that provided flood control
4 protection to adjacent areas and made any necessary modifications to nearby water supply
5 intakes prior to restoration being undertaken should have been considered. The EIR also fails to

6 include sufficient information about each alternative, including regarding the environmental
7 impacts of the No Channel Alternative, which is identified as the environmentally superior
8 alternative.

9 41. The EIR failed to integrate a discussion of other actions by agencies with
10 permitting authority over sensitive natural resources. When there is credible evidence that
11 sensitive natural resources, for instance, are within the project area, an EIR must discuss other
12 agencies' authority over those resources and discuss how the project alternatives have been
13 devised to anticipate that authority. (Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach
14 (2017) 2 Cal.5th 918, 938.) This failure to integrate and disclose the ramifications of other
15 agencies' actions for the project alternatives renders the EIR's discussion of alternatives
16 inadequate.
17 The EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze the Project's Significant Environmental Impacts
18 42. CEQA requires that an EIR describe the proposed project's significant
19 environmental effects. Each must be revealed and fully analyzed in the EIR. (Pub. Resources
20 Code, § 21100, subd. (b), CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.2, subd. (a).) "[T]he adequacy of an EIR's
21 discussion of environmental impacts is an issue distinct from the extent to which the agency is
22 correct in its determination whether the impacts are significant." (Sierra Club v. County of
23 Fresno (2018) 6 Cal.5th 502, 514 [Friant Ranch]; Cleveland National Forest Foundation v. San
24 Diego Assn. of Governments (2017) 3 Cal.5th 497, 514-515; see also Berkeley Keep Jets Over
25 the Bay Com. v. Board of Port Cmrs. (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1371.) "[W]hether a
26 description of an environmental impact is insufficient because it lacks analysis or omits the
27 magnitude of the impact is not a substantial evidence question. A conclusory discussion of an
28 environmental impact that an EIR deems significant can be determined by a court to be

SOLUR!
MESERVE 11
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

inadequate as an informational document without reference to substantial evidence." (Friant

2 Ranch, supra, 6 Cal.5th at 514.) To "comport with its intended function" an EIR must include
3 "detail sufficient to enable those who did not participate in its preparation to understand and to

4 consider meaningfully the issues raised by the proposed project." (Ibid. [internal quotations

5 omitted].) "Whether or not the alleged inadequacy is the complete omission of a required

6 discussion or a patently inadequate one-paragraph discussion devoid of analysis, the reviewing
7 court must decide whether the EIR serves its purpose as an informational document." (Ibid.)
8 43. The EIR lacks adequate analysis and omits an adequate discussion of the
9 magnitude of the project's impacts, therefore failing to provide decision makers with sufficient
10 analysis for numerous resources.

11 44. The EIR analysis of the project's flooding and hazards impacts is legally
12 inadequate and fails to adequately disclose and analyze the project's significant impacts on
13 flooding, flood storage, and emergency access for several reasons, including, without limitation:
14 a. The EIR fails to disclose how the project would comply with the Delta
15 Stewardship Council's Prioritization of State Investments in Delta Levees and
16 Risk Reduction (23 Cal. Code Regs., § 5012), thereby reducing the availability of
17 funding for priority levee projects in the Delta.
18 b. The EIR fails to adequately disclose the project's impacts to the local and regional
19 flood plains as well as to the FEMA 100-year flood plain (i.e. increased base flood
20 elevations).
21 c. The EIR fails to adequately disclose the project's impacts of additional stress on
22 flood-control infrastructure, such as hydraulic-sheer stresses that have potential to
23 cause erosion.

24 d. The EIR fails to disclose the impacts of the converting a county road into a full-
25 height levee, and its potential to result in inadequate emergency access and/or
26 impede or redirect flood flows and the impacts of the significant modifications to
27 the flood storage capacity of USACE Levee Unit 109.
28

e. The EIR misleadingly overstates the flood benefits of the project in an effort to
2 justify provision of state funding intended for flood control to the project, which is
3 primarily a restoration project.

4 45. The EIR's analysis of the project's hydrology impacts is legally inadequate and

5 fails to provide for several reasons, including, without limitation:

6 a. The EIR fails to adequately analyze how the project's design would alter tidal
7 dynamics and sediment deposition, increase water residence times and facilitate

8 harmful algal blooms, reduce available nitrogen, and increase salinity.
9 b. The EIR fails to disclose how the project's impacts to tidal range would increase
10 agricultural pumping costs and increase exposure of pumps and siphons to
11 damage.

12 C. The EIR fails to disclose how cumulative projects would alter Sacramento River
13 and other Delta channel flows and tidal ranges.
14 d. The EIR fails to disclose the impacts of increased invasive species (including
15 plants and animals) would have on water supply.
16 e. The EIR fails to adequately analyze how changes in flow and velocity due to
17 project design would jeopardize human health and safety.
18 f. The EIR fails to adequately analyze, or disclose the extent of, the project's
19 seepage impacts.
20 g. The EIR improperly fails to discuss the reasonably foreseeable consequences with
21 regard to critical infrastructure used for agricultural and municipal water suppliers,
22 and the likelihood that indirect project effects will impair rights of other water
23 users in the vicinity due to physical or legal limitations on pumping.
24 h. The EIR fails to disclose the water source that will be used to inundate the land

25 within project boundaries, and whether the diversion of that water will impact the
26 supply available to other users in the project vicinity.
27 46. The EIR's analysis of the project's water quality impacts is legally inadequate for
28 several reasons, including, without limitation:

SOLURI
MESERVE 13
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

H a.

2 The EIR fails to identify the project's need for a water right from the State Water
Resources Control Board.

3

4 b. The EIR fails to adequately consider the project's impacts to domestic, agricultural

5 industrial and other beneficial uses of water, improperly relying on D-1641 as a

6 threshold of significance. Substantial evidence submitted by beneficial users of

7 water in the Delta establish the need for more specific threshold to actually protect
beneficial uses.

8 C.

9 The EIR fails to disclose the likely water quality degradation as a result of less
Sacramento River water flows into the Central Delta.
10

11 d. The modeling completed for the project's salinity analysis is incomplete and does

12 not constitute substantial evidence. For example, insufficient water years were

13 examined; no critical dry years were included in the analysis. In addition, the
modeling was improperly characterized as predictive.
14

15 e. The DEIR fails to adequately consider whether the project would require the

16 release of stored water to maintain D-1641 standards, and the resulting impacts of
imposition of Term 91 on other water users.

17 f.

18 The EIR fails to adequately analyze the project's impact on the formation of
Harmful Algal Blooms ("HABs").
19 g.

20 The EIR fails to account for potential drought conditions and/or climate change in

21 its water quality analysis. Droughts reduce flows and increase water temperature,

22 both which facilitate formation of HABs and other water quality concerns.

23 h. The EIR fails to disclose how the project would impact compliance with the
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta methylmercury TMDL.
24 i.

25 The EIR fails to sufficiently analyze water quality impacts to local water supplies

26 due to project-related increases in a wide range of water quality constituents,

27 including chloride, bromide, nitrate, pesticides, increased temperatures, and the

28 potential for increased occurrence of HABs such as toxic Microcystis. Increases

- in these constituents would threaten water

2 rendering it potentially unusable users' ability to use their water supply,

3 47.

4 The EIR's analysis of the project's biological resource impacts is legally
inadequate for several reasons, including, without limitation:

5

6 a. The EIR fails to adequately analyze how the project would create ideal habitat
conditions for the Asian clam, which depletes nutrients in the Delta.

8 b. The EIR fails to adequately analyze how increased methylmercury would harm the
local food chain and fish stocks.

9 C.

10 The EIR fails to consider operational impacts where there are entrainment hazards
to listed fish species.
11

12 d. The EIR's disclosure of permanent impacts to Western Pond Turtle nesting habitat
is inadequate.

13 48. The EIR's analysis of the project's agricultural resources impacts is legally
14 inadequate for several reasons, including, without limitation:
15 a.

16 The EIR fails to adequately analyze how seepage and changes to the flood control
system would impact agriculture in the Delta.
17

18 b. The EIR fails to adequately analyze how interference with agricultural diversions,
including pumps and siphons, would impact agriculture.
19

20 c. The EIR fails to adequately analyze the impacts of increased salinity levels in

21 water used for irrigation. The long-term effects of the increased salinity in the
Central Delta shown in the modeling are not disclosed.
22

23 d. The EIR fails to disclose effects on crop productivity when salts build up in soils.

24 The EIR fails to recognize that means to remove salts from soils are generally not

25 available in most of the Delta due to unique characteristics of Delta farmland and
irrigation.

26 e.

27 The EIR fails to analyze effects on agriculture from cancellation of Williamson
Act contracts.

28

SOLURI

CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

49. The EIR's analysis of the project's land use impacts is legally inadequate for
2 several reasons, including, without limitation:

3 a. The EIR fails to adequately analyze the project's consistency with all relevant
v policies of the Delta Protection Commission's 2010 Land Use and Resource
Management Plan for the Primary Zone of the Delta.
6 b. The EIR fails to analyze the project's consistency with the Delta Plan as amended,
7 including Risk Reduction Policy 1: Prioritization of State Investments in Delta
8 Levees and Risk Reduction (23 Cal. Code Regs., § 5012).
9 50. The EIR's analysis of the project's air quality impacts is legally inadequate
10 because it fails to adequately analyze the project's air quality impacts.
11 51. The EIR's analysis of the project's traffic impacts is legally inadequate and fails to
12 adequately analyze degradation of local roads and infrastructure.
13 The EIR Fails to Adequately Analyze Cumulative Impacts

14 52. An EIR must evaluate a project's cumulative impacts if the project's incremental
15 effects "are significant when viewed in connection with the effects of past. . . current...and
16 probable future projects." (CEQA Guidelines, §15065, subd. (a)(3); Banning Ranch
17 Conservancy V. City of Newport Beach (2012) 211 Cal.App.4th 1209, 1228.) The purpose of
18 cumulative impact analysis is to ensure a project is not considered in a vacuum. (Whitman v.
19 Board of Supervisors (1979) 88 Cal.App.3d 397, 408.)
20 53. The EIR's analysis of the project's cumulative impacts is legally inadequate for
21 several reasons, including, without limitation:
22 a. The EIR failed to provide a complete list of all related cumulative projects. For
23 instance, the cumulative impact of the project combined with new major SWP
24 diversions proposed by DWR on the Sacramento River are not considered.
25 b. The EIR excludes other related private and public restoration and other projects,
26 projects in Solano County, and past projects from consideration as cumulative
27 projects. Consideration of these projects would lead to potentially significant
28 impacts not disclosed in the EIR.

SOLURI 16 MESERVE

C. The EIR includes inadequate consideration of cumulative impacts and piecemealing
2 of impacts as to degradation of water quality resulting from operation of the water
3 export projects and related actions to satisfy the Biological Opinions for protection of
4 Delta Smelt and other listed species.

5 DWR Failed to Adequately Respond to Public Comments

6 54. The FEIR failed to respond in good faith to public comments raising deficiencies
7 with the document. The FEIR responses are insufficient to comply with CEQA's public
8 participation requirements (CEQA Guidelines, § 15088, subd. (c)) in many instances, including,
9 without limitation: (1) the FEIR refers to master responses and cross-references specific
10 responses that do not in fact address the comments; and (2) the responses fail to address the
11 specific issues raised, and provide no meaningful information.
12 55. Where experts disagree about an EIR's data or methodology, the EIR should
13 summarize main points of disagreement and explain why expert comments have been rejected.
14 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15151; see also Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay Comm. v. Bd. of Port
15 Commissioners (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 1344, 1367, 1371.) The FEIR fails to include these
16 critical disclosures.

17 56. The FEIR failed to provide a reasoned, good faith response to comments,
18 including but not limited to impacts on agriculture, flood control infrastructure, water quality
19 and the FEIR's failure to adequately analyze the project's consistency with applicable policies.
20 DWR Failed to Recirculate the EIR after Adding Significant New Information
21
57. Recirculation under Public Resources Code section 21092.1 and CEQA 22

23 Guidelines section 15088.5, subdivision (a) was required due to the addition of "significant new

24 information" that "deprives the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment upon a

25 substantial adverse environmental effect of the project or a feasible way to mitigate or avoid

26 such an effect after public review, but before certification of the EIR. (See also Pub. Resources

27 Code, § 21092.1; Laurel Heights Improvement Ass'n. V. Regents of University of California

28 (1993) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1129-1130.)

58. DWR became aware of significant new information prior to certification of the
SOLURI
MESERVE 17
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

FEIR that mandated re-circulation, yet DWR refused to do so. This new information includes,

2 but is not limited to, additional water quality modeling included in the FEIR in an attempt to

3 correct the deficient DEIR hydrology and water quality impacts analyses and changes in Delta

4 Plan policies relating to reduction of flood risks.

5 The EIR Distorts the Concept of Mitigation in Violation of CEQA

59. DWR failed to adopt all feasible mitigation measures and alternatives to reduce or

7 avoid significant impacts, in direct contravention of CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15126.6,

8 15126.4.)

60. By determining that certain project impacts were less than significant, DWR
10 avoided necessary development of mitigation needed to ensure significant impacts do not occur

11 in the future.

12 61. "Mitigation measures must be fully enforceable through permit conditions,
13 agreements, or other legally-binding instruments." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15126.4, sub. (a)(2).)
14 The EIR fails to sufficiently identify any such permit conditions, agreements or other legally-
15 binding instruments that would ensure adequate funding and other conditions are in place to
16 fully implement all of the adopted and/or deferred Mitigation Measures.
17 62. The EIR relies upon mitigation measures that are impermissibly deferred, and,
18 because they have not been adequately formulated, are unenforceable. (CEQA Guidelines, §§
19 15126.4, subd. (a)(1)(b); see also Sacramento Old City Ass'n v. City Council (1991) 229
20 | Cal.App.3d 1011, 1029 [performance criteria must be articulated at project approval].)
21 Mitigation in the EIR, however, does not articulate specific performance criteria.
22 63. The EIR also impermissibly relies on future "Adaptive Management" actions to
23 mitigate impacts. The EIR contains no analysis of environmental impacts that would occur if
24 Adaptive Management was not effective.

25 64. As discussed above, the EIR fails to integrate a discussion of other actions by
26 agencies with permitting authority over other resources. As with the discussion of project
27 alternatives, when there is credible evidence that resources, including sensitive natural
28 resources, are within the project area, an EIR must discuss other agencies' authority over those

SOLURI
MESERVE 18
A LAW
CORPORATION Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

resources and discuss how mitigation measures have been devised to anticipate that authority.

2 (Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach (2017) 2 Cal.5th 918, 938.) The full

3 scope of other agencies' permitting authority over the project is not disclosed in the EIR, nor did

4 DWR adequately consult with the agencies with responsibility for these resources. A

5 discussions or analysis of mitigation measures relating to a resource is inadequate if it does not

6 sufficiently integrate other agencies' authority and likely actions.

7 DWR's CEQA Findings Are Not Supported by Substantial Evidence

65. DWR's CEQA Findings violate CEQA, and are not supported by substantial

10 evidence. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15091, subd. (b).)
66.
11 The Findings improperly conclude without substantial evidence that all project

12 impacts would be mitigated to less than significant levels.
67.
13 Required findings regarding critical project impacts are entirely absent.
68.
14 The failure to include findings to support impact determinations prevents the

15 public from understanding the full range of project impacts, and critically, the reasons why the

16 agency has determined the impacts are less than significant. DWR's omission of findings for

17 these impacts constitutes a failure "to bridge the analytic gap between the raw evidence and

18 ultimate decision." (Topanga Ass 'n for a Scenic Cmty. v. County of L.A. (1974) 11 Cal.3d 506,

19 515; see also Pub. Resources Code, § 21081, subd. (a)(1).)
69.
20 To the extent that DWR's CEQA Findings do discuss particular impacts, DWR's

21 determination that these impacts would be less than significant is unsupported by substantial
evidence.
22
70.
23 The EIR's project objectives are legally inadequate.

5 legally adequate environmental document for the project and complied with all other
6 requirements of CEQA, as directed by this Court pursuant to Public Resources Code section
7 21168.9;

8 2. That the Court issue a stay, temporary restraining order, a preliminary and/or
9 permanent injunction barring DWR, and all persons working on their behalf, from proceeding

12 3. That the Court issue a writ of mandate directing DWR to suspend all necessary
13 steps and all activity in furtherance of the project until DWR takes all necessary steps to bring
14 its actions into compliance with CEQA;

15 4. That Petitioner be awarded costs of this proceeding;
16 5. That Petitioner be awarded reasonable attorney's fees for this action pursuant to
17 Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable provisions of law; and

RE: Notice to Attorney General of Commencement of Action against the California Department of Water Resources
To the Attorney General of the State of California:

Please take notice, under Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of
Civil Procedure section 388, that on December 3, 2020, Petitioner Central Delta Water
