4 Management Committee ("PLUM" or "Committec") and a public hearing was conducted on
February 18, 2020. PLUM recommended that the City Council deny the appeal. However, on
6 March 17, 2020, the City Council referred the matter back to PLUM to further consider the 5

CEQA Appeal. Depiote this, the Committee waived further consideration of the appeal. The City
8 Council then scheduled the appeal for a public hearing on April 22, 2020, but the matter was

14 CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS BuJYS!!M €8€8 15 19. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public
16 agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental
17 implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the

19 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires 18 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure

20 governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects
21 to of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
22 otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with

23 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.
24 CEQA is California's broadest environmental law and helps to guide public
agencies such as the City during issuance of permits and approval of projects. Courts have 20.

26 interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest protection of the environment within the reasonable scope 25

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 of the statutes. CEQA applies to all discretionary projects proposed to be conducted or approved
2 by a City, including private projects requiring discretionary government approval. See California
3 Public Resources Code, sections 21000 - 21178, and Title 14 Cal. Code Regs., section 753, and
4 Chapter 3, sections 15000 - 15387.

5 21. A strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an Environmental
6 Impact Report ("EIR") is built into CEQA which is reflected in what is known as the "fair
7 argument" standard, under which an agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence
8 in the record supports a fair argument that a project may have significant effect on the
a I environment. No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75, 82; Friends of "B" St.
10 V, City of Haywood (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988, 1002.

'SII!H Auereg 14 CEQA.' [Citations.] An EIR is an 'environmental "alarm bell'" whose purpose it is to alert the
15 public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached ecological
16 points of no return.™ Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of California
17 (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.
18 23. Under CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, if a project is not exempt and may cause
19 a significant cffect on the environment, the agency must prepare an EIR. PRC §§ 21100, 21151;
20 14 Cal. Code Regs. §15064(a)(1), (f)(1). "Significant effect upon the environment" is defined as
21 "a substantial or potentially substantial adverse change in the environment." PRC $21068; 14 Cal
22 Code Regs $15382. A project "may" have a significant effect on the environment if there is a
23 "reasonable probability" that it will result in a significant impact. No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 3

(VIOLATION OF CEQA) 4

5 24. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
6 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
7 25. The Amending Motion adopted by the City Council added a "new condition
8 requiring the applicant to get final approval of the building design from Council District 10 prior

0 to the issuance of any building permits." There should be no question that this "design review" is
10 a mitigation measure designed to reduce the impacts of the Project. The crux of the dispute
11 between the parties relates to the impacts of the Project's design on historical resources. 8 d11 'dnoJ9 MET |ouueyO -1Z06 L BUNS "PAIE EUJYSIM €8€8 12 However, CEQA does not authorize "mitigated" categorical exemptions. A project is either
13
8 exempt or it is not. The City erred by adding mitigation measure (design review) as a condition
'SIlIH Áuereg 14 of approval. In evaluating whether a categorical exemption may apply, the City may not rely on
15 mitigation measures as a basis for concluding that a project is categorically exempt, or as a basis a
16 for determining that one of the significant effects exceptions does not apply. Salmon Protection
17 & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098.
18 26. Moreover, conditioning a project on another agency's future review of
19 environmental impacts, without evidence of the likelihood of effective mitigation by the other
20 agency, is insufficient to support a determination by the lead agency that potentially significant

22 requiring formulation of mitigation measures at a future time violates the rule that members of 21 impacts will be mitigated. Sundstrom v. Cnty. of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296. Further,

23 the public and other agencies must be given an opportunity to review mitigation measures before
24 project is approved. PRC § 21080, subd. (c)(2)). See League for Protection of Oakland
25 Architectural & Historic Resources V. City of Oakland (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 896; Gentry v.

3 Cal.App.3d at p. 306, (condition requiring that mitigation measures recommended by future

6 mitigation measures to be recommended in a future study may conflict the requirement that
7 project plans incorporate mitigation measures before a proposed negative declaration is released
8 for public review. PRC § 21080, subd. (c)(2); 14 Cal Code Regs § 15070(b)(1). Studies
conducted after a project's approval do not guarantee an adequate inquiry into environmental
10 effects. Such a mitigation measure would effectively be exempt from public scrutiny.
11 27. Petitioner is excused from any defense of failing to exhaust administrative 0SAR 12 remedies on the basis that the public was not given notice of the Amending Motion. PRC MET |ouueyo *dnoJs L1Z06 BLOS VONE BUIJUSI!M E8€8 13 §21177(e) states that the exhaustion requirement "does not apply to any alleged grounds for
'SIl!H Beverly 14 noncompliance with this division for which there was no public hearing or other opportunity for
15 members of the public to raise those objections orally or in writing prior to the approval of the
16 project, or if the public agency failed to give the notice required by law." The Amending Motion 17 adding the building design condition for the Project was not introduced until April 29, 2020, the
18 date of the final hearing of the CEQA Appeal. The City did not provide any notice of the
19 Amending Notice to Petitioner. The City provided notice of the public hearing, but not of the
20 Amending Notice. A CEQA notice must be substantively accurate as well as procedurally
21 proper. Members of the public are not required to ferret out the true nature of a project and its
22 potential consequences if the public notice is misleading. McQueen v Board of Dirs. (1988) 202 23 Cal.App.3d 1136. For the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement to apply, the
24 agency must give notice sufficient to alert interested parties of the basis for its proposed action
25 and give them a meaningful opportunity to respond. Save the Plastic Bag Coalition v County of
26 Marin (2013) 218 Cal.App.4th 209.

1 28. Further, the City erred by granting Petitioner's CEQA appeal "in part," and yet

2 not requiring environmental review. Environmental review is required under CEQA if a public is

8 [207 Cal. Rptr. 3d 314, 378 P.3d 687] (San Mateo Gardens).)" Id. at 1187.
9 29. Further, unusual circumstances prevent usage of the Class 32 exemption from
CEQA. While the subject parcel is vacant, it is located within the geographical area on South
11 Normandie Avenue whose properties comprise what has been identified and named as the 10

8 d11'dnoJ5 MET jeuueys L1Z06 12 "Normandie-Mariposa Apartment Historic District'. The "District" is listed in the National

8 B}NS PALE EUJJUSIM €888 13 Register of Historic Places, having been nominated in 1994 when the CRA was operating. It is
'SIl!H Beverly 14 listed in the California Register of Historic Resources. As such, the Normandie-Mariposa
15 Apariment Historic District is presumed to be historically or culturally significant. (Public
16 Resources Code §21084.1 which defines what constitutes a Historical Resource.) This alone
17 makes this site and this area unusual within the meaning of the holding of the California
vs. City of Berkeley (2015) 60 Cal. 4th 1086. 18 Supreme Court in Berkeley Hillside Preservation
19 Here, the unusual circumstance is reflected by the fact that (i) the Normandie Ave. streetscape is
20| unique given that the entire 700 So. Normandie block consists of an unbroken chain of
built in the 1920's which (ii) have been recognized as Victorian-designed 4-5 story structures
22 unique and historic by their having been incorporated into a nationally recognized historic 21

23 "district", and thus presumed to be historically significant.
The entire 700 So. Normandie block has retained its integrity of location, design,
25 setting, feeling, and association for nearly a century. A significant, substantial, adverse impact on 24 30.

1 block) would occur where (in the words of the City's CEQA Guidelines) the construction of the
2 738 So. Normandie 7-story contemporary designed project would reduce "the integrity and
3 significance" of the entire "Normandie-Mariposa Historic Apartment District" by breaking up
what is now an unbroken street frontage of 4-5 story Victorian designed buildings with 7-Story
5 contemporary structure. Having broken this "significance threshold", the Project must undergo a
6 CEQA review where ways can be discussed and found to mitigate what would otherwise be a
7 substantial adverse change in the significance of an important historical resource, the
8 Normandie-Mariposa Historic Apartment District.
9 31. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion
10 by failing to comply with the procedures outlined in the CEQA Guidelines and failing to conduct
