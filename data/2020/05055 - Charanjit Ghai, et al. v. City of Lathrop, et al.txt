26 of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and for a declaration of rights directed to the CITY

27 OF LATHROP ("City"), by and through the City Council, to vacate its approval of the CFT

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE;
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

r undertake environmental review as required by the California Environmental Quality Act

2 (Pub.Res.C. $§21000, et. seq., hereafter "CEQA"), and to properly notice and conduct a public

3 hearing on the Project as required by the Ralph M. Brown Act (Govt. C. $$54950, et. seq.,

4 hereinafter "Brown Act") and the State Planning and Zoning Law (Govt. C. §§65000, et. seq.,

5 hereafter "Planning and Zoning Law") prior to considering the Land Use Permits for approval.

6 The City's actions in approving the Project on May 11, 2020, violate State and local laws and

7 amount to a prejudicial abuse of discretion. A writ of mandate is necessary to remedy the City's

8 failure to adequately address the Project's environmental impacts, to ensure the City complies

9 with all applicable laws, including laws regarding notice and conduct of public hearings, and to

10 ensure proper review, disclosure, and mitigation of the potential environmental impacts resulting

11 from the approval and development of the Project pursuant to CEQA. By this Petition,

12 Petitioners represent the following:

9.
4 In or about January 2019, the City approved "Phase J" of the CFT development

5 project, which included development of a "Panda Express Restaurant" located along Old Harlan

6 Rd. in Lathrop. A condition of approval of Phase I required that development of "Phase Il"

7 would be subject to a traffic study to address traffic and circulation impacts from Phase II

8 development.

10.
9 In or about late 2019 Real Parties in Interest applied to the City to develop the

10 Project with a 1,608+ sq. ft. Sonic Drive In restaurant and an 862+ sq. ft. Dutch Brothers Coffee

11 restaurant on the Phase II site. The Phase II Project site is located immediately south of Phase I.

A.
12 Planning Commission Meeting

11.
13 On or about March 4, 2020, Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of

14 emergency in California due to a growing number of infections from the COVID-19 pandemic.
12.
15 On or about March 12, 2020, in light of Governor Newsom's proclamation and

16 the increasing number of COVID-19 infections, the City of Lathrop Planning Commission

17 ("Planning Commission") allowed members of the public to attend their March 18, 2020 meeting
via teleconference.
18
13.
19 On or about March 18, 2020, the City Planning Commission held a public hearing

20 on the Project. The Planning Commission approved the Project (Site Plan Review No. SPR-20-

21 6) by a 3-1 vote.

14.
22 Ghai, who is immunocompromised and considered high-risk under COVID-19

23 guidance, took the option to attend the March 18th public hearing telephonically. Ken Anderson

24 of KD Anderson & Associates, Inc., ("Anderson") Ghai's traffic engineer, also attended the

25 Planning Commission meeting telephonically. Ghai and Anderson presented objections to the

26 Project on the basis the Project would result in significant unmitigated traffic effects.
15.
27 The Planning Commission's resolution also stated the Project was exempt from

28 CEQA under 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15332 (the "In-fill exemption").

{001 72675.) 4
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE:
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 16. The Planning Commission's resolution approving the Project included several
2 "Conditions of Approval" designed to mitigate traffic impacts from the Project, including:
3 a) Realignment of the Old Harlan Road connection to Harlan Road by

4 approximately 100 ft. to the north and providing two lanes on the Old
5 Harlan Road approach: one for left turns and one for right turns;

6 b) Restriping of the median of Harlan Road just south of the new intersection
7 to provide defined back-to-back left turn lanes-one for northbound left

8 turns into Old Harland Road and one for southbound left turns into the
driveway providing access into the Lathrop Crossing shopping center on
10 the east side of Harland Road;
11 c) Providing signs adjacent to the exit lanes at each of the three Project
12 driveways showing an arrow pointing to the right and a message stating
13 "I-5 access turn right";
14 d) Providing a sign on the southbound Old Harland Road approach to Harlan
15 Road with an arrow pointing left and a message stating "I-5 a access turn
16 left";

17 e) Providing sidewalks on the south side of W. Lathrop Road extending east
18 and west of Old Harland Road (from the I-5 Ramps intersection to the
19 Chevron driveway);
20 f) Providing a crosswalk at the W. Lathrop Road/I-5 NB Ramps intersection
21 crossing W. Lathrop Road just east of the intersection;
22 g) Providing pedestrian "WALK/DON'T WALK" signals in conjunction
23 with the crosswalk; and
24 h) In order to avoid congestion in the Sonic driveway, Dutch Brothers may
25 be required to provide moveable orange cones across the internal Dutch
26 Brothers-Sonic during peak activity times.

28 the Project with the San Joaquin County Clerk-Recorder's Office.

{00172675.} 5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

B. Appeal from Planning Commission to City Council
2 18. Following the Planning Commission hearing, on or about March 19, 2020,
3 Governor Newsom issued Executive Order No. N-33-20-the "Shelter in Place" order directing
4 all Californians to stay at home. San Joaquin County followed suit with its own "Shelter in

5 Place" order.

6 19. The "Shelter in Place" orders instructed Californians to remain in their homes,
7 unless they were seeking "essential" good and/or services or reporting for 'essential work" as

8 defined by federal, state, and local entities. None of the definitions included attending public
9 hearings as an "essential" activity.

10 20. On or about March 27, 2020, Ghai submitted APL-20-42 "Appeal of Planning
11 Commission" to the City of Lathrop appealing the Planning Commission's decisions approving
12 the Project.

13 21. Petitioners did not hear anything from the City regarding this appeal until Friday,
14 May 8, 2020, at or about 3:44 P.M. At that time, the City emailed a to Ghai a copy of the agenda
15 for the Monday, May 11, 2018 City Council meeting.

16 22. The City did not distribute to Ghai, publish, or post any notice of the public
17 hearing on Ghai's appeal prior to May 8, 2020.

18 23. The agenda sent to Ghai and published for the meeting did not include
19 information regarding teleconference options to attend the hearing remotely.
20 24. At approximately 3:52 P.M., on May 8, 2020, shortly after receiving notice of the
21 hearing, Ghai, who is not an attorney, contacted the City asking if he would be able to attend his
22 hearing telephonically like he did at the Planning Commission Meeting.
23 25. At approximately 4:33 P.M., on May 8, 2020, the City responded to Ghai's
24 inquiry and informed him that the meeting would be "standard format" and that a video
25 conference and/or teleconference option would not be available for the hearing on his appeal.
26 The City advised Ghai that he could attend the meeting in person, send someone to the meeting
27 in his place, or submit written comments prior to 3:00 P.M. on May 11, 2020 (the following
28 business day).

{00172675.) 6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

26. Ghai responded shortly thereafter to inform the City that its notice of the hearing
2 was unacceptable as was thr failure to provide a videoconference or teleconference appearance
3 line. Ghai requested, at a minimum, that videoconferencing and/or teleconferencing capability
4 be made available. Ghai again reminded the City that he is immunocompromised and

5 would not be able to attend the hearing on his appeal in-person due to the ongoing COVID-19

6 pandemic.

7 27. Later that same day, Ghai, by and through his business attorney, sent a letter to
8 the City informing the City that it failed to provide mandatory 10-day notice and the failure to
9 provide videoconference and/or teleconference capabilities for the meeting did not adequately
10 accommodate immunocompromised individuals like Ghai and/or individuals who were
11 attempting to shelter in place.

12 28. At 9:57 P.M. on May 8, 2020, the City provided Ghai with a WebEx call in
13 number and instructions on how to appear telephonically at the City Council Meeting on May 11,
14 2020.

15 29. At 12:50 P.M. on May 11, 2020, Ghai emailed his formal comment letter to the
16 City. In his letter, Ghai asserted, among other things:
17 a) The City failed to provide sufficient notice of the hearing and such error
18 prejudiced Ghai's ability to present his appeal;
19 b) Since the two restaurants proposed for the Project would be drive-thru
20 only, increased vehicle stacking onto Old Harlan Road would lead to
21 traffic impacts on Old Harlan Road, likely causing traffic to divert into
22 Petitioners' parking lot located across the street across the street from the
23 Project;

24 c) The City should, at a minimum, eliminate one of the two drive-thru uses
25 proposed for the Project.
26 30. Ghai's letter also included an expert review from traffic engineer, Anderson,
27 regarding the potential traffic impacts at the Project. Anderson's report noted that the City's
28

{00172675.) 7
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

r proposed conditions simply "deferred mitigation by kicking the can down the road for further

2 review" without discussing any mitigation measures or improvements to address the impacts.

3 31. The City Council Agenda for the appeal hearing discussed the Traffic Study

4 prepared a as a condition of approval for Phase II of the Project. The City's staff report cites the

5 Traffic Study stating, "The Traffic Study concluded that both in the existing plus project, and the

6 cumulative plus project scenarios, there will be additional queuing on the northbound Old Harlan

7 Road approach to W. Lathrop Road and that diversion of some backed up drivers through the

8 Chevron or O'Reilly-Burger King driveways could be possible." (emphasis added)

9 32. On Monday, May 11, 2020, Ghai and Anderson attempted to attend the hearing

10 via the provided WebEx call in. During the meeting, Ghai and Anderson experienced difficulties

11 watching and participating in the hearing. The difficulties included, no sound on the video,

12 erratic sound, poor connection to the hearing via WebEx, and a delay in the feed to the City's

13 broadcast system.

14 33. The City Council denied Ghai's appeal and approved the Project with a 4-1 vote.

15 Conditions were modified by the City Council with the intent of further mitigating the traffic

16 impacts to the Project. The City Council Resolution approving the Project (Resolution No. 20-
17 4722) cites 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15332 ("In-Fill" exemption) exempting the Project from
18 CEQA.

19 34. Neither the City nor any other party filed a notice of exemption following the
20 Council's approval of the Project.

21 35. On or about June 10, 2020, Petitioners, by and through their counsel of record,

22 submitted a letter to the City titled "APL 20-42 CFT Phase 2 Appeal (Sunny Ghai): (1) Request
23 to Cure and Correct Notice and Hearing Defects and Conduct New Hearing on Appeal (Govt. C.
24 §§ 54960.1, 65090, et. seq.); (2) Notice of Intent to file CEQA action (Pub. Res. C. , 21167.5),

25 which set forth alleged violation of the Planning and Zoning law, CEQA, the Ralph M. Brown

26 Act, and concepts of due process and fair hearing in the City's treatment of the Appeal. A true
27 and correct copy of that letter is attached hereto as EXHIBIT A.

8 {00172675.)
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE:
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 II. STANDING, EXHAUSTION, AND RIPENESS
2 36. Pursuant to Public Resources Code $ 21177 Petitioners have satisfied any
3 requirement to exhaust administrative remedies concerning the Project. Petitioners timely
4 appealed from the Planning Commission's approval of the Project, thereby staying and/or
5 vacating the Planning Commission's approval and mooting the NOE filed on March 20, 2020.
6 37. Ghai and his traffic engineer, KD Anderson & Associates, commented on the
7 Project and objected to the City's failure to mitigate traffic impacts from the Project at the
8 Planning Commission and the City Council hearings on the Project.
9 38. Petitioners and their representatives presented evidence and arguments that the
10 Project and exemption are inconsistent with the City's General Plan and zoning laws, CEQA, the
11 Brown Act, and due process and fair hearing requirements.
12 39. Petitioners have a direct and beneficial interest in the City's full compliance with
13 CEQA and all other applicable laws in approving this Project. Further, Petitioners own and/or
14 operate a business near the Project that will be directly impacted by the Project's unmitigated
15 and significant traffic impacts.

16 40. The City has a mandatory and public duty to comply with CEQA, the Brown Act,
17 the City's General Plan and zoning laws, due process and fair hearing guarantees, and all other
18 applicable laws when approving the Project.

19 41. Petitioners' CEQA, Planning and Zoning law, and due process and fair hearing
20 claims are ripe for review because the City took a final action on the Project and issued its
21 decision approving the Project on May 11, 2020.
22 42. These claims are timely because neither the City nor Real Parties filed a NOE
23 following the Council's approval of the Project on May 11, 2020 - which would have
24 commenced a 35-day limitations period to bring the CEQA claims pleaded herein. Instead, a
25 180-day limitations period to bring the CEQA claims applies, with which this filing complies.
26 The Planning and Zoning Law and Due Process/Fair hearing claims are subject to a 90-day
27 - limitations period - which this filing satisfies.
28

{00172675.} 9
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

43. Petitioners Brown Act claims are ripe for review because Petitioners submitted a
2 "Cure and Correct Letter" to the City on June 10, 2020 (EXHIBIT A), pursuant to Government

3 Code § 54960.1(c)(2). The City's 30-day time limit to respond to that letter expired on July 10,
4 2020. Petitioners bring the instant action within the 15-day time limit required by Government

5 Code §54960.1(c)(4).

6 44. Petitioners will be directly and substantially affected by the adverse
7 environmental impacts and land use changes that may result from the Project.

8 45. Petitioners have standing to bring this action as property owners, taxpayers,
9 | and/or business owners in the City who will be adversely affected by this Project and because

10 they seek to compel a public duty in the form of the City and Real Parties in Interest complying

11 with State and local land use and environmental laws.

12 46. Petitioners have complied with Pub. Res. C. § 21167.5 by sending written notice

13 of this action to the City on or about June 10, 2020 (EXHIBIT A).

14 47. Petitioners will comply with Pub. Res. C. § 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure

15 c 388 by notifying the Attorney General of California of the commencement of this action.

16 48. Petitioners do not have a plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course

17 of law.

18 49. A clear and significant benefit will be conferred upon the general public and

19 Petitioners by City fully satisfying the requirements of State and local law in approving the

20 Project and/or determining if the Project is exempt from CEQA. A clear and significant benefit
21 will be independently conferred upon the general public by the City fully satisfying the

22 requirements of CEQA, the Brown Act, and applicable general plan policies and zoning laws. In

23 instituting this action, Petitioners seek to procure enforcement of a mandatory duty. Petitioners
24 are vitally and beneficially interested in assuring that the mandate of law is fully satisfied and
25 fulfilled. Granting the relief requested by Petitioners would confer a significant benefit on a
26 large class of persons, in that fundamental rules of law would be affected.
27 50. By the authority of Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5,
28 Government Code sections 65009, and Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5 and

{00172675.} 10
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE;
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a Writ of Mandate to set aside the determination that

2 the Project is exempt from CEQA and the approval of the Land Use Permits.

3 51. By the authority of the Brown Act (Government Code § 54950, et. seq.), this
4 Court has jurisdiction to provide Petitioners declaratory relief and/or injunctive relief for the

5 City's past violations of the Brown Act and the likelihood of future violations.

6 52. Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of action alleged in this Petition
7 arose in San Joaquin County where both the Project and the agency that approved the Project are

8 located.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
10 WRIT OF MANDATE-CODE CIV. PROC. $81085, 1094.5, 21168, 21168.5

11 (Prejudicial Abuse of Discretion: Unlawful Use of CEQA Infill Exemption)

12 53. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein by reference the allegations contained

13 in Paragraphs 1 through 52, above.

14 54. The City committed prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in the
15 manner required by law in relying on certain mitigation measures and/or conditions of approval
16 applied to determine the Project is exempt from CEQA pursuant to 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15332.

17 55. The Class 32 "In-fill Exemption" can be used only when "approval of the Project

18 would not result in significant effects relating to traffic" (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15332(d).)

19 56. The City received, from Petitioners and others, substantial evidence that the

20 Project would cause significant environmental impacts, including without limitation, impacts to

21 traffic.

22 57. Ghai and his traffic engineer KD Anderson & Associates presented substantial

23 evidence that the Project will have significant environmental impacts to traffic across his parking

24 lot and on Old Harlan Road.

25 58. Neither the City's traffic report not the proposed conditions were circulated for

26 public comment and review as required of a CEQA analysis.

27 59. Moreover, the City's traffic engineer proposed, and the City Council approved,
28 several conditions of approval for the Project to reduce traffic impacts.

{00172675.} 11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE:
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

60. The City's traffic engineer further conceded that some traffic form the Project

2 would be divided through Petitioners' property.

3 61. The Conditions of approval act as mitigation measures to reduce the Project's
4 impacts on traffic and circulation in order to bring the Project within the scope of the Class 32

5 In-Fill exemption.

62. A CEQA exemption may not rely on conditions or mitigation measures designed

7 to reduce a project's impacts.

8 63. Because the Project was approved with mitigation measures and/or conditions of

9 approval, it is not eligible to qualify for a CEQA exemption like 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15332.

10 64. The City committed prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in the
11 manner required by law by determining that the Project was exempt from CEQA and not

12 properly evaluating and mitigating impacts from the Project.

16

17 65. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein by reference the allegations contained

18 in Paragraphs 1 through 64, above.

19 66. Cal. Gov't. Code § 65090, et. seq., governs public agency hearings as they relate

20 to land use permits. The law requires notice of a public hearing regarding land use permits be
21 given at least 10 days prior to the hearing by posting, publication, and distribution of the notice

22 of such hearing.

23 67. The notice must include the date, time, and place of the public hearing, the

24 identity of the hearing body or officer, a general explanation of the matter to be considered, and
25 general description, in text or by diagram, or the location of the real property, if any, that is if

26 subject to the hearing (Cal. Gov't. Code § 65094.)

27 68. The notice of the hearing must also be mailed or delivered at least 10 days in

28 advance of the hearing, to the project site owner, the applicant, neighboring property owners,

(00172675.} 12
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 agencies providing infrastructure services, and any person requesting notice (Cal. Gov't. Code

2 §§ 65091(a), 65092.)

3 69. The City violated state planning and zoning law by failing to provide, post,

4 publish, and distribute notice of the meeting at least ten days before. The City further violated

5 the Planning and Zoning Law by failing to provide notice of the meeting to Petitioners as a

6 neighboring landowner and/or an interested party at least ten days before the meeting.

7 70. The City violated the Planning and Zoning Law by failing to notify Ghai of the

8 May 11, 2020, City Council hearing on his appeal until May 8, 2020--a mere three calendar

9 days (and one business day) before the hearing.

10 71. The City's failure to provide notice in the time or manner required by the

11 Planning and Zoning law prejudiced Petitioners' ability to pursue its appeal to the Council.
12 Petitioners and their experts were afforded insufficient time to prepare for the appeal hearing.

18 in Paragraphs 1 through 71, above.

19 73. Petitioners own and/or operate a business near the Project that will be directly

21 74. On or about May 11,.2020, City adopted Resolution No. 20-4722, approving the

22 Project and indicating the Project was exempt from CEQA pursuant to the infill exemption (14

23 Cal. Code Regs. § 15332.) §

24 75. Petitioners did not receive adequate notice of the meeting under state planning

25 and zoning law, requiring 10 days notice of the hearing by posting, publication, and distribution
26 of the notice of such hearing.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE:
COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

77. Pursuant to Civil Code § 1060, an actual controversy exists between Petitioners
2 and Respondent regarding the notice requirement as appeals to project approval pursuant to
CEQA. Petitioners contend that a public hearing on an appeal of a project requires 10 days
4 notice, whereas the City only provided 3 days notice of the appeal hearing via posting the
meeting agenda.

6 78. Petitioners desire a declaration as to the validity of the City's noticing of the
7 hearing and approval of the Project. Such declaration is necessary and appropriate at this time
8 under the circumstances in order that Petitioners may ascertain their rights and duties with
9 respect to the City's interpretation of the notice requirement under State Planning and Zoning
10 Law.

11 79. Petitioners have been harmed by the inadequate notice of their appeal hearing
12 because it did not afford Petitioners and/or their experts and/or attorneys adequate time to
13 prepare for the hearing.

16 Inadequate Teleconferencing Violating Due Process and Fair Hearing Requirement)

17 80. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein by reference the allegations contained
18 in Paragraphs 1 through 79, above.
19 81. The Brown Act authorizes the legislative body of a local agency to "use
20 teleconferencing for the benefit of the public and the legislative body of a local agency in
21 connection with any proceeding authorized by law" (Cal. Gov't. Code § 54953(b)(1).)
22 82. The Brown Act further provides "teleconferencing.may be used for all purposes
23 in connection with any meeting within the subject matter jurisdiction of the legislative body"
24 (Cal. Gov't. Code § 54953(b)(2).)
25 83. Finally, the Brown Act provides, "the legislative body of a local
26 agency....shall…conduct teleconference meetings in a manner that protects the statutory and
27 constitutional rights of the parties or the public appearing before the legislative body of a local
28 agency" (Cal. Gov't. Code § 54953(b)(3).)

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

1 84. On or about May 11, 2020, Petitioners and/or their representatives attempted to

2 connect to the City Council meeting and public hearing via teleconferencing wherein the City

3 Council approved the Project.

4 85. The teleconferencing capability that the City put in place for the public hearing on
5 Petitioners' appeal was inadequate and deprived Petitioners of the ability to fairly participate in

6 the hearing.

7 86. The teleconferencing with connection issues, inadequate and erratic audio, among|

8 other problems, did not benefit the public, and did not protect their statutory and constitutional
9 rights as Petitioners had difficulty participating in the meeting, particularly, giving comments on
10 the Project approval, or following the meeting on the delayed video feed.
11 87. On June 10, 2020, Petitioners, by and through their counsel of record, sent a letter
12 to the City informing them of the poor connection to the meeting, which prevented them from
13 fully participating in the meeting. This letter was sent within 30-days of the challenged action
14 and provided the City 30 days to "cure and correct" their violations of the Brown Act.
15 88. Petitioners have pursued their judicial remedies with deliberate speed within 15

16 days of the City's decision not to cure and correct the action to approve the Project and desire a
17 judgment at the earliest possible date.

18 89. Accordingly, the City Council's approval of the Project as adopted in Resolution
19 No. 20-4722, should be deemed null and void as the City's failure to provide adequate
20 teleconferencing did not provide Petitioners with due process and a fair hearing as guaranteed by
21 the United States and California Constitutions.

Re: APL-20-42 CFT Phase 2 Appeal (Sunny Ghai): (1) Request to Cure and Correct Notice and Hearing Defects and Conduct New Hearing on Appeal (Govt. C. §§ 54960.1, 65090, et seq.); (2) Notice of intent to file CEQA action (Pub.Res.C. § 21167.5)
Dear Mayor Dhaliwai:
This office represents Sunny Ghai/Ghai Management Service, Inc. ("Ghai") -the Appellant in the above referenced land use matter. The purpose of this letter is to call your attention to substantial violations of both State Planning and Zoning Law (Gov. Code §§ 65000, et seq.) and the Ralph M. Brown Act (Gov. Code §§ 54950, et seq.) - violations which deprived Mr. Ghai and the public of due process and a fair hearing and which jeopardize the legitimacy and finality of the action taken by the Lathrop City Council in denying Mr. Ghai's appeal of the CFT Phase 2 project on May 11, 2020. For these reasons, we respectfully request that the City Council void Resolution No. 20-4722 and properly notice and conduct a new hearing on the appeal in order to cure and correct these material errors.

1. Factual Background

Based on communications with the City Attorney and available public records, it seems the facts are largely undisputed:

On March 4, 2020, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued Executive Order (N-25-20) declaring a state of emergency in California arising from a growing number of COVID-19 infections.
On March 18, 2020 the Planning Commission held a hearing and approved Site Plan Review No. (SPR-20-6) with a 3-1 a vote (Comm. Dresser dissenting, Comm. Ralmilay absent). The March 18, 2020 meeting agenda included the following statement:

(00171240.}

P: 209-477-8171 - F: 209-477-2549 3031 W. March Lane, Suite 230 • Stockton, CA 95219 MCJGLAW.COM

Mayor Sonny Dhaliwal
Reqeust to Cure and Correct and Notice of Intent to File CEQA Action
June 10, 2020

In Light of Governor Newsome's Executive Order (N-25-20) of March 12, 2020; proclaiming a State of Emergency as a result of the threat of COVID-19, and to further control the spread of the virus and minimize the risk of infection; attendance at the City of Lathrop Planning Commission meeting of March 18 will be available by teleconference... Attendance by teleconference is NOT mandatory; however, due to recommendations and guidance from the Office of the Governor, State and Local Health Officials regarding COVID19, and to protect our employees and the public we invite any interested party join the public meeting by teleconference.
Mr. Ghai, who is immuno-compromised, appeared telephonically at the March 18, 2020 meeting and objected to the project. In particular, Mr. Ghai presented evidence that the Project's design would divert traffic through his site and would aiso cause traffic issues on Old Harlan Road. Rather than acknowledge that the Project presented potentially significant traffic impacts to the area, the Planning Commission adopted several conditions of approval for the purpose of mitigating this impact and declared the Project exempt from CEQA.

The following day, the Governor issued Executive Order (N-33-20) establishing the State's first "Shelter in Place" order. Over the course of the next several days, San Joaquin County issued additional local shelter in place orders. The crux of these orders instructed persons to remain in their homes unless seeking essential goods or services or reporting for "essential" work as determined by the State, Federal, and local government entities. Attending public hearings in person was not included as a "essential" activity. Mr. Ghai timely appealed the Commission's decision to the City Council.

The City did not thereafter contact Mr. Ghai about his appeal, until 3:44 p.m. on Friday, May 8, 2020, at which time City staff emailed to Mr. Ghai copy of the May 11, 2020 City Council meeting agenda. That agenda listed Mr. Ghai's appeal as item 5.1. The City did not distribute to Mr. Ghai, publish, or post any notice of the public hearing on the land use appeal prior to May 8th. In particular, the City did not provide 10-days notice of the public hearing in any manner.
Unlike the earlier Planning Commission agenda, and notwithstanding the subsequently-issued State and County shelter in place orders, the Council agenda did not include a teleconference option. Shortly after receiving the email, at about 3:52 pm on Friday afternoon, Mr. Ghai, who is not an attorney, contacted City planning staff inquiring, "Terry, Will this meeting be similar to the last one [referring to the March 18th Planning Commission hearing] where we will be able to talk on the phone?"
At approximately 4:29 p.m. that afternoon, City staff responded to Mr. Ghai that the meeting would be "standard format" and a teleconference/video conference option was not available for the hearing on his appeal - but advised that Mr. Ghai could

(00171240.}

Mayor Sonny Dhaliwal Reqeust to Cure and Correct and Notice of Intent to File CEQA Action June 10, 2020
Page 3 of 11

attend in person, send someone to the meeting in his place, or submit written comments prior to 3:00 p.m. on Monday May 11th (the following business day).
Mr. Ghai responded shortly thereafter that both the City's notice of the hearing and proposed meeting format was unacceptable and, at a minimum, the Council should provide the same teleconference capability as was made available to the Planning Commission. "This is totally unfair,' he pleaded. "I get an email Friday afternoon about a meeting on Monday evening. Iam the one who knows the facts and I am not allowed to attend because I am immunocompromised." Both the State and County remained under "shelter in place" orders at this time.
Hearing no response, Mr. Ghai contacted his business attorneys, Hansra Cardenas, regarding his concerns with the city's unwillingness to provide reasonable accommodations for his condition.

That evening, attorney Enedina Cardenas prompily drafted and sent a letter to the City on behalf of Mr. Ghai asserting that the City failed to provide mandatory 10-day notice of the hearing and that the in-person only meeting format did not provide adequate accommodation for those like Mr. Ghai who are immunocompromised (or otherwise attempting to shelter in place) in violation of State and Federal disability laws, the Brown Act, and applicable shelter in place orders.
At or around the same time, city staff sent an email to Mr. Ghai advising that the City had established a "WebEx call in number" for the May 11th Council meeting. The City did not respond to Ms. Cardenas' comments, and did not address the allegation that the City had failed to provide adequate notice for the public hearing as required by law.

On Saturday, May 9, 2020, City staff e-mailed Mr. Ghai clarifying the WebEx teleconference process.

At 12:50 p.m. on Monday May 11, 2020, Mr. Ghai e-mailed his formal comment letter to the City Council. This correspondence asserted: (1) that the City had failed to provide sufficient notice of the hearing and such error prejudiced Mr. Ghai's ability to present his appeal; (2) because the two restaurants proposed for the project would be drive-thru only, increased vehicle stacking onto Old Harlan Rd., leading to traffic impacts on Oid Harlan Rd. likely to divert traffic into Mr. Ghai's parking lot located across the street; and (3) requested that the Council, at a minimum, eliminate one of the two drive-thru uses proposed. Mr. Ghai also included a copy of an expert review of the traffic study from Ken Anderson of KD Anderson & Associates - which supported Mr. Ghai's traffic impact concerns from "cut-through traffic from the project" and noted that the City's proposed conditions simply deferred mitigation by "'kick[ing] the can down the road' for further review" without any discussion of actual mitigation measures or improvements to address these impacts.

{00171240.}

Mr. Ghai and his traffic engineer addressed the Council via WebEx during the Council meeting and before Council's vote. City Council denied the appeal and approved project with a 4-1 vote (Lazard dissenting). Conditions were modified by the Council based with the intent of further mitigating the traffic impacts from the Project. The City cited Guidelines § 15332 as its basis for exemption in Resolution No. 20-4722.
2. The City failed to notice the hearing as required by State Planning and Zoning Law and this error prejudiced Mr. Ghai's ability to present his appeal.
The City was required to provide notice of the hearing at least ten days in advance. instead, the City did not advise Mr. Ghai or the public of the time and date of the Monday, May 11th hearing until releasing the meeting agenda just one business day prior.

a. The City failed to provide mandatory 10-days notice of the hearing
Section 17.125.050 of the Lathrop Municipal Code provides, "Notice of hearing for the appeal shall be provided pursuant to noticing requirements consistent with state law." State Law sets for the notice of land use permit hearings and appeals in Chapter 2.7 of the State Planning and Zoning Law (Govt. C. §§ 65000, et. seq.) starting at Govt. C. §65090 - which mandates posting, publication, and distribution of notice of such a public hearing no less than ten days prior to the hearing.
Further, "When a provision of this title requires notice of a public hearing to be given pursuant to this section, notice shall be published pursuant to Section 6061 in at least one newspaper of general circulation within the jurisdiction of the local agency which is conducting the proceeding at least 10 days prior to the hearing, or if there is no such newspaper of general circulation, the notice shall be posted at least 10 days prior to the hearing in at least three public places within the jurisdiction of the local agency." Govt. Code § 65091(b).
Such notice must include "the date, time, and place of a public hearing, the identity of the hearing body or officer, a general explanation of the matter to be considered, a and a general description, in text or by diagram, of the location of the real property, if any, that is the subject of the hearing." (Govt. C. § 65094.) This notice must also be mailed or delivered, at least 10-days in advance of the hearing, to the project site owner, the applicant, neighboring property owners, and agencies providing certain infrastructure services (Govt. C. § 65091(a)) - as well as persons requesting notice (Govt. C. § 65092).

Such 10-day notice must be provided for public hearings on "an application for a conditional use permit or equivalent development permit…or an appeal from the action taken on any of those applications." Govt. C. §65905. Here, the site plan that

(00171240.}

Mayor Sonny Dhaliwal Reqeust to Cure and Correct and Notice of Intent to File CEQA Action
June 10, 2020
Page 5 of 11

was the subject of the appeal is development permit within the meaning of the
statute.1

It is undisputed that the City neither prepared nor provided any such notice in the
form or time required. Accordingly, the city failed to provide notice in the manner required by the Municipal Code and State Planning and Zoning Law. See, e.g., Environmental Defense Project of Sierra County V. County of Sierra (2008) 158 Cal. App. 4th 877.

b. The City's error was prejudicial to the public hearing process and to Mr.
Ghai's appeal

The City's error, though likely inadvertent, is material and deprived not only is the appellant, Mr. Ghai, of a fair hearing, but failed to apprise other members of the public and public agencies with jurisdiction over project infrastructure of the hearing on the
appeal. Such error constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion by the city.
As Mr. Ghai explained in his May 11, 2020, letter the City's failure to provide notice prevented him from having sufficient time to prepare for the hearing and to engage his traffic expert to prepare for the hearing. Moveover, while Govt. C. § 65093 provides, "The failure of any person or entity to receive notice given pursuant to this title... shall not constitute grounds for any court to invalidate the actions of a local agency for which the notice was given," this harmless error clause is inapt to the City's error here.
A statutory prerequisite to a City invoking this standard is "giv[ing] notice pursuant to" State Planning and Zoning Law. Meaning, for example, the City properly published and mailed the 10-day notice to all required recipients, but Mr. Ghai failed to timely check his mail to receive notice. That is simply not what occurred in this situation. Rather the City entirely failed to prepare, distribute, and publish notice of this hearing in the time or manner required by law. Such error by the City is more than a mere technical defect, negating any harmless error defense. (See, e.g., Sounhein v. City of San Dimas (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1255, 1260-1261 [voiding zoning ordinance adopted in
violation of Planning & Zoning Law notice requirements].2 For this reason, rather than

1 The City's Site Plan ordinance requires the hearing body to exercise discretion and to find that the project is designed so that "traffic congestion is avoided and that pedestrian and vehicular safety and welfare are protected, and there will not be adverse effect on surrounding property" before approving a site plan.
2 As the court of appeal explained, "..the failure of the city to provide the requisite notice and
hearing procedures cannot be deemed harmless or nonprejudicial. (See § 65010, subd. (b).) The failure to provide notice and public hearings was not a mere minor technical defect (cf.
Hayssen v. Board of Zoning Adjustments (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 400, 407-408, 217 Cal.Rptr. 464;
Mack v. Ironside (1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 127, 131, 110 Cal.Rptr. 557), but rather the process was

Page 6 of 11 6

litigate this procedural issue in the courts, Mr. Ghai requests that the City cure and correct this error by vacating the May 11th decision and properly noticing and conducting a new hearing on his appeal.
3. The City's teleconference system did not afford due process and a fair hearing to Mr. Ghai on his appeal.
The "teleconference meeting" accommodation provided by the City did not afford a fair hearing to Mr. Ghai on his appeal. Unlike the Planning Commission hearing on this project, which included a teleconference format due to COVID 19, the Council meeting on the appeal was scheduled only for in-person appearances. Only after Mr. Ghai raised objections to this process - due to COVID-19 shelter-in-place orders and his
own immunocompromised state, did the City agreed to allow Mr. Ghai and his traffic engineer to appear via WebEx conference.
Unfortunately, the teleconference technology was insufficient to provide a sufficient
opportunity to be heard. During the meeting here was no video feed on the WebEx channel. Rather, the City staff instructed Mr. Ghai to follow the meeting on the "live" internet stream. But in delivery of that stream actually ran several minutes behind the
live meeting, resulting in a delay in information received by Mr. Ghai. Further, the audio feed on the WebEx system would intermittently cut in and out, preventing Mr. Ghai and his team from hearing and understanding all that was being stated and presented regarding this appeal in real time.

While excluding an appellant opponent from his own public hearing on a controversial land use project may be a developer's dream, it fails to satisfy basic requirements of due process and the right to a fair hearing. As both a party to the a appeal and a neighboring businessowner, Mr. Ghai has a Constitutionally protected
right to due process and fair hearing in this matter. (See Horn V. Co. of Ventura (1979) 24
Cal. 3d 605.)

Further, Gov't Code § 54953(b)(3) expressly provides that the City must "conduct
teleconference meetings in a manner that protects the statutory and constitutional
rights" of citizens. The process imposed for this "teleconference hearing" fails to satisfy this standard. Reducing the "hearing" to a conference line with no visual interaction is not a hearing so much as a deliberation without due process. Even the League of California Cities has warned of the perils of conducting a land use hearing via audio teleconference, explaining:

fundamentally flawed by the complete omission of any public notice or hearings when adopting the zoning ordinance…The absence of the required public notice and public hearings thus renders Ordinance No. 941 void."

[Gov't Code § 54953(b)(3)] has interesting ramifications where substantive or procedural due process rights are at stake. For example, in land use proceedings, maps or photographs may be crucial to a council's decision on an application or to a neighbor's appreciation of the decision's ramifications. Although video teleconferencing, a simultaneous telecopy, or some other digital transmission of an exhibit to each location would probably provide adequate due process, it may be difficult to protect these rights when only audio teleconference equipment is used...

https://www.cacities.org/UploadedFiles/LeagueInternet/6e/6ed3a54b-6766-4b67-
bee9-e024ea3a3d2b.pdf

Here, although the City provided a telephone cal-in number, this setup was inadequate for Mr. Ghai and his expert consultant to be able to visually present his appeal - particularly as it related to traffic impacts from the project and the flow of traffic into the Burger King parking lot.
Accordingly, we request that the City cure and correct these defects in complying with the Brown Act, State Planning and Zoning Law, and due process and fair hearing rights by re-noticing the hearing and affording a video-conference process as other agencies in San Joaquin County have done during this process. Additionally, the undersigned would intend to appear in person for the appellant.
4. The City violated CEQA and committee a prejudicial abuse of discretion in utilizing a Class 32 "infill" exemption.

The City's reliance on the Class 32 "infill" exemption for this Project reflects a gross misapplication of the exemption. A categorical exemption "represents a determination" by the Resources Agency "that a particular project does not have a significant effect on the environment. [Pub. Res. Code] § 21084. It follows that an activity that may have a significant effect on the environment is not categorically exempt." Davidon Homes (1997) 54 Cal.App.4th 109, 114. Moreover, "[E]xemption categories should not be unreasonably expanded beyond their terms." McQueen v. Board of Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1148 (rejecting agency's attempt to use Class 25 exemption for preserving improved property and potentially expanding use of that property).
The Class 32 exemption (CEQA Guidelines, § 15332) applies, on its face, to "infill" projects that plainly meet five separate criteria. As relevant here, the Project fails to satisfy the fourth category which provides, "(d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic....'

Both the Staff Report and the City's third party traffic study commissioned for the project acknowledge that the Project is "likely to draw customers from Interstate 5" along Harlan Rd. and that due to the configuration of traffic flow the only ways to

return to 1-5 is by "1) traveling north on Old Harlan Road, turning right onto Lathrop Road, and making a U-turn at Harlan Road, and continuing westbound on Lathrop Road to Interstate 5, or 2) entering the Old Harlan Road driveway to the O'Reilly-Burger King site [the Ghai property], crossing the site and turning left onto Harlan Road, then left at Lathrop Road and continuing westbound on Lathrop Road to Interstate 5." The City further acknowledges this traffic flow will cause additional queueing on the northbound Old Harlan Road approach to W. Lathrop Road and that diversion of some backed up drivers through the Chevron or [Ghai property] driveways could be possible.' (Staff Report p. 5)
To mitigate these impacts, the City's traffic engineer proposed and the City Council adopted several conditions of approval for the project. To this end, the staff report concludes, "the Traffic Study adequately analyzed the project, identified a concern, and recommended off-site improvements that will improve traffic flow, reduce the potential for cut through traffic, and will improve safety for pedestrians." In other words, the City's traffic study identified a potentially significant impact, proposed mitigation measures to reduce that impact, and the City relied on these mitigation measures to
apply the Class 32 exemption.

At the Council hearing, staff further noted that if these conditions did not adequately address the impacts, the Council could revisit at a later time to see if additional mitigation should be imposed. Three material errors flow from this application of CEQA.

First, having identified specific concerns from Project-related traffic impacts, the City was required to prepare environmental review. See, Georgetown Preservation Society V. County of El Dorado (2018) 30 Cal.App.5th 358, 369 [' 'All local agencies shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared an [EIR] on any project that they intend to carry
out or approve which may have a significant effect on the environment.' But to
avoid the need to prepare an EIR for no reason, if there is if a possibility that the project may have a significant environmental effect, an agency generally prepares an initial study, the purpose of which is 'to determine if the project may have a significant effect on the environment.' ... 'For CEQA purposes [this] "means enough relevant information and reasonable inferences from this information that a fair argument can be made to support a conclusion, even though other conclusions might also be reached." This
unusual 'fair argument' standard of review over a public agency's decision has been characterized as setting a "low threshold requirement for initial preparation of an EIR and reflects a preference for resolving doubts in favor of environmental review when
the question is whether any such eview is warranted." Here, the City's identification of traffic impacts presented a fair argument triggering the City to prepare an EIR (or, at a minimum, an initial study). Thus, the Class 32 exemption which requires that the Project "would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic" is entirely inapt to the Project and the City erred in utilizing this exemption.

{00171240.}

Second, the City's application of "conditions" of approval to address concerns
identified in the traffic study does not support the exemption. These conditions were
proposed to address specific traffic impacts identified by the City. But as the courts
explain, "If a project may have a significant effect on the environment, CEQA review
must occur, and only then are mitigation measures relevant." Salmon Protection & Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098, 1107 [holding County's reliance on "conditions" to address single family home project's impact to on- side waterway violated CEQA. Exemption may only be invoked if the project meets exemption criteria absent conditions or mitigation measures]. More pointedly,
"proposed mitigation measures cannot be used to support a categorical exemption; they must be considered under the standards that apply to a mitigated negative a declaration." Azusa Land Reclamation Co. v. Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster
(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1199 [holding use of existing facilities exemption for landfill
expansion improper where agency relied on mitigation measures to prevent further
pollution from existing operations.]3 Further, Mr. Ghai's traffic consultant, Ken Anderson, explained the conditions do not adequately resolve the problem. Thus, the City's reliance on various mitigation measures is of no help.
Finally, "[bly deferring environmental assessment to a future date, the conditions run
counter to that policy of CEQA which requires environmental review at the earliest
feasible stage in the planning process." Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d. 296, 307. Here, the City's decision to move forward with the exemption based on staff representations that Project impacts could be evaluated or studied at a
later date, unlawfully defers mitigation in violation of CEQA. Id. (See also, San Joaquin
Raptor Rescue Center v. County of Merced (2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 645, 671 [despite inclusion of various future objective standards, County's EIR improperly deferred formulation of mitigation measures for vernal pools and burrowing owl habitat]. Here, the City's approach to addressing traffic impacts from the project is just as, if not more, fatally defective as the approaches rejected in Sundstrom and County of Merced.
Accordingly, the City failed to proceed in the manner required by law and committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion in approving the Project based on a Class 32 exemption. For this reason, we urge the City to void the project approval and to prepare environmental review and to formulate appropriate mitigation measures before proceeding to approve the project.

5. Authority to Cure and Correct

The City's authority to cure and correct the errors of procedure identified in this letter is found at Gov. Code. § 54960.1(c) (2), "within 30 days of receipt of the demand [to
3 Compare Wollmer v. City of Berkeley (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 1329 in which City upheld City's Use of Class 32 exemption because developer's voluntary dedication of 5' right of way was not a mitigation measure to address traffic impacts but a component of the project that assisted the City with existing traffic issues.

cure violations of the Brown Act], the legislative body shall cure or correct the
challenged action and inform the demanding party in writing of its actions to cure or correct or inform the demanding party in writing of its decision not to cure or correct the challenged action.' While the procedural notice and hearing errors identified in this letter are an amalgamation of various aspects of the Government Coe (Brown Act and State Planning and Zoning Law) as well as CEQA and both the United States and California Constitutions' guarantees of due process and fair hearing, nothing in prohibits § 54960.1 from curing and correcting procedural errors arising outside of the Brown Act. Accordingly, my client requests the City the opportunity to voluntarily cure ali procedural and substantive defects arising from the City's May 11, 2020, approval of the Project as identified in this letter.

6. Notice of intent to file CEQA action

Pursuant to Pub.Res.C. § 21167.5 please take notice that absent any revocation of the approval by the City, Mr. Ghai intends to timely file in the Superior Court of California, County of San Joaquin, a petition for writ of mandate challenging the City's adoption of the negative declaration and approval of the project pursuant to Code.
Civ. Proc. §§ 1085, 1094.5, and Pub. Res. C. §§ 21167, 21158, and 21168.5.4

4Via email dated June 9, 2020, the City Attorney's office has suggested that Mr. Ghai's appeal from the Planning Commission's March 18, 2020 decision to approve the project somehow did not include challenge of the of the Planning Commission's exemption finding made as part of the project approval (see PC Resolution No. 20-6), and that the issue of the exemption was not before the Council on appeal and the original Notice of Exemption ("NOE") filed on or about March 20, 2020 remained undisturbed.

This is factually and legally incorrect. The City appeal form submitted by Mr. Ghai appeals from
the Commission's March 18, 2020 decision on this project. The appeal form does not include a
place to identify the project name or application number only the "location" -. which Mr. Ghai
identified by physical address. As his basis for appeal, he identifies traffic impacts from the project (clearly an environmental impact within the scope of CEQA and critical to the
application of the Class 32 exemption). Within the Commission's approving resolution are findings in support of the decision to approve the project, including finding 5 which addresses the City's claimed basis for exempting the project from CEQA as an infill project. There was not a separate decision on the CEQA exemption for Mr. Ghai to appeal.
Nor does the appeal form or the City's appeal ordinance require a dissatisfied party to appeal from specific findings. In fact, Chapter 17.125 is very vague • simply requiring an appeal to be submitted in writing, stating the basis or grounds of the appeal. (17.125.040.A, and A.2.). Here,
Mr. Ghai did just that - identifying traffic impacis to Old Harlan Rd. and his own project site as the basis for the appeal. "[E]nvironmental review is not supposed to be segregated from project approval... "If an agency provides a public hearing on its decision to carry out or approve a project, the agency should include environmental review as one of the subjects for the hearing." Bakersfieid Citizens for Local Control v. City of Bakersfield (2004) 124 Cal.App.4th 1184, 1201. Bifurcating environmental considerations from project approval is a fatal error. Id. The City cannot now claim that because Mr. Ghai's appeal didn't include expressly challenge

finding number 5 that somehow the City's exemption determination was beyond the scope of review. Moreover, Mr. Ghai was not represented by professional consultants or attorneys during the administrative process. Though he did have a traffic engineer offer expert opinion on the traffic impacts from the a project, KD Anderson is not a planning consultant and was not Mr. Ghai's agent in the process. Mr. Ghai's business attorney, Ms. Cardenas, only intervened to object to the time and form of the notice of the hearing provided on May 8th, and the City's unwillingness, at the time, to accommodate Mr. Ghai's inability to attend the meeting in person. The undersigned was not engaged until after the May 11th hearing. As has long been explained by courts considering CEQA exhaustion defenses, "less specificity is required to preserve an issue for appeal in an administrative proceeding than in a judicial proceeding. This is because '[]n administrative proceedings, [parties] generally are not represented by counsel. To hold such parties to knowledge of the technical rules of evidence and to the penalty of waiver for failure to make a timely and specific objection would be unfair to them." Citizens Assn. for Sensible Development of Bishop Area v. County of inyo (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 151, 163. Here, Mr. Ghai's appeal form sufficiently apprised the City that he objected to the traffic analysis and mitigation measures that were proposed and the reasons for such objection. This is more than sufficient under the law.

Finally, a notice of exemption filed before a project is approved is defective and will not trigger the 35-day limitations period. Coalition for Clean Air v. City of Visalia (2012) 209Cal.App.4th 408. Here, Mr. Ghai's timely appeal stayed the Planning Commission's decision and triggered a de novo hearing on the Project before the Council (See 17.125.060). The Council's resolution further provides that the Council "does hereby approve the CFT Phase 2 Project, Site Plan Review No. SPR-20-6..." Because the City did not render its final approval of the Project until May 11, 2020, the NOE filed prior to this final approval in March is was voided by the appeal.
