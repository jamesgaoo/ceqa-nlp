1 INTRODUCTION

2
1. Petitioner Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis, Inc. ("Petitioner" or
"SBCRC") challenges the County of Santa Barbara and Board of Supervisors of the County of
4 Santa Barbara's (collectively "the County" or "Respondents") approval of the Castlerock
5 Family Farms II, LLC Cannabis Cultivation Project ("Project" or "Castlerock Project"), on
6 grounds that the approval violates the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").
7
2. The Board of Supervisors directed the development of a Program Environmental Impact
8 Report ("PEIR") for the Cannabis Ordinance and Licensing Program in 2017. On February 6,
2018, the Board of Supervisors certified the PEIR and adopted an ordinance regulating
10 commercial cannabis land uses (Santa Barbara County Land Use and Development Code
11 ("LUDC") § 35.42.075, hereafter the "Cannabis Ordinance") in the inland areas of the County.
12 The PEIR addressed the County's then-proposed ordinance and licensing program at a general,
13 program-level of analysis, deferring future analysis for individual projects since "individual
14 cannabis activity site-level details are not available . or would be considered too speculative
15 for evaluation." PEIR, ES-1. At that time, the legal cannabis industry in California was in its
16 infancy, and the range and severity of environmental impacts resulting from the operation of
17 commercial cannabis in areas used by existing conventional agricultural activities was not well
18 understood. Since the PEIR's certification, new facts have emerged as the County has
19 implemented its cannabis program indicating several important omissions in the environmental
20 impact analysis in the PEIR and establishing the existence of new avoidable and/or mitigable
21 adverse impacts. Additionally, mitigation measures and other means of reducing impacts
22 identified by the PEIR have since been abandoned or modified.
23
3. The County Planning and Development Department issues its cannabis Land Use Permits
24 as staff-level ministerial permits without the benefit of CEQA analysis or a public hearing
25
process. When an appeal is filed, the County prepares a "CEQA Checklist" that examines only
26 whether mitigation measures identified in the PEIR apply, and does not use the Checklist to
27 reflect or otherwise conduct a project-specific analysis of all potential impacts and consider site-
28 specific conditions, including surrounding land uses, in its CEQA analysis.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 1
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Castlerock)

1 4. All projects approved by the County must conform to the General Plan, including the

2 goals and policies or the Agricultural Element, which seek to preserve the viability of

3 agriculture throughout Santa Barbara County. Cannabis has special status, as it is designated as

4 an agricultural product by state law and county code, and is excluded from the definition of an

5 agricultural crop. Cannabis is disqualified from the protections of state and local "Right to

6 Farm" authorities, is subject to comprehensive state and local taxing and regulatory programs,

7 and is not yet recognized as legal under federal law.

8 5. Petitioner brings this Petition for Writ of Mandamus on their own behalf, and on behalf

9 of its members and supporters, and on behalf of the general public under California Code of

10 Civil Procedure $1094.5, and alleges as follows:

11

12 PARTIES

13
6. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 5 as if fully set forth
14
herein.
15
* 7. Petitioner Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis, Inc. is a California Public
16
A2 Benefit Corporation whose purposes include protecting the interests of neighborhoods,
17 communities and others affected by the County's inadequate regulation of commercial cannabis
18 activities, upholding the County's General Plan and zoning ordinances, and enforcing CEQA
19 when actions adversely affect other land uses including residential uses and agriculture.
20 Petitioner, through its members, supporters and representatives, participated in the proceedings
21 below, including by providing a detailed written appeal and oral comments and argument to
22 Respondent Board of Supervisors. Petitioner is interested in preserving the integrity of the
23 environment in the County of Santa Barbara including its viewsheds, community character,
24 agricultural viability, and compatibility between land uses. Petitioner possesses beneficial
25 interests in this proceeding, in its own stead and on behalf of its members and supporters, that
26 will be adversely affected by the violations of CEQA and by approval of the Project. Petitioner,
27 as a government watchdog organization, has public interest and taxpayer standing as it seeks
28
enforcement of Respondent's public duty to comply with CEQA, uphold the General Plan,

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 2

1 protect agricultural viability, and to prevent nuisance and deleterious impacts to residents and

2 long-established businesses. These claims and the relief sought are broad-based such that the

3 participation of individual members and supporters is not required.

4 8. Petitioner's supporters and members work, own businesses and reside throughout the

5 County, including in the Santa Ynez Valley where the Project is located. Petitioner's supporters

6 and members include individuals and businesses that manage vineyards, create blends, produce

7 wine and maintain tasting areas for people to sample wines produced at that winery and

8 purchase wine by the bottle and case for consumption offsite. The Project is located between

9 and among a number of such wineries, including wineries that maintain tasting areas and sell

10 wine they produce as an essential element of economic survival, particularly in the time of

11 COVID.

12 9. Lacking any opportunity to comment on the Project prior to approval, one of Petitioner's

13 supporters appealed the Project's closed door approval by the Planning and Development

14 Department to the Planning Commission, and, following the Planning Commission's approval

15 of the Project, Petitioner appealed that approval to the Board of Supervisors and participated in

16 the proceedings below including by submitting written and oral comments. Petitioner itself, and

17 Petitioner's supporters and members, are beneficially interested in the outcome of this

18 proceeding.

19 10. Respondent County of Santa Barbara is organized under the laws and Constitution of the

20 State of California. The County is empowered, among other duties, to provide for the orderly

21 planning and management of land use within its borders, including amendment of County land

22 use ordinances, subject to the obligations and limitations of all applicable state, federal and

23 other laws, including CEQA and the General Plan. The County is the lead agency under

9

10 STATEMENT OF FACTS
11

12 25. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 24 as if fully set forth

herein.
13

14 26. The State of California established the first statewide regulatory system for medical

15 cannabis businesses, the Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act (MMRSA), in

16 September 2015. The County adopted Article X, Medical Marijuana Regulations, on January

17 19, 2016 which established that then-existing medical marijuana cultivations operations that

18 were legal under California law were legal nonconforming uses. In November 2016, California

19 voters approved Proposition 64 for the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (AUMA), which legalized

20 adult personal non-medical use and cultivation of cannabis under a strict system of control and

21 authorized additional local requirements. As enacted by the electorate, the AUMA established al

22 phased implementation program, where for the first five (5) years, small and local farmers

23 would initially be eligible for state licenses allowing the maximum of 10,000 square feet

24 (Small) or one acre (Medium) of cultivated cannabis, with the licensing of grows in excess of

25 that size (Large) deferred. The California Legislature then passed SB 94, the Medicinal and

26 Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA), a hybrid regulatory structure for

27 both medical and recreational cannabis activities. The MAUCRSA amended the initial phased

28 approach and authorized the "stacking" of multiple "Small" cultivation licenses at a single site

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 6
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Castlerock)

and by a single person or company, leading to the licensing of much larger grow sites much
sooner than was contemplated by Proposition 64.

3 27. The County of Santa Barbara advanced and ultimately approved a package of ordinance
amendments including amendments to the County's LUDC to authorize and regulate

5 commercial cannabis operations in the inland areas of the County ("Cannabis Ordinance"). The

6 Cannabis Ordinance amendments included: regulations that specify how and where, by zone,

7 cannabis activities may occur; general development standards that would apply to all

8 commercial cannabis activities and specific development standards would also apply to allowed

9 commercial cannabis cultivation, manufacturing, and microbusinesses, and new regulations

10 governing cannabis activities, including cultivation, manufacturing, distribution, testing, and

11 retail sales.

12 28. The County prepared a Program Environmental Impact Report ("PEIR") for the Cannabisl

13 Ordinance, which the Board of Supervisors certified on February 6, 2018. The PEIR identified

14 12 significant and unavoidable adverse "Class I" environmental impacts associated with

15 implementation of the Cannabis Ordinance for which the Board of Supervisors approved a

16 Statement of Overriding Considerations, including the finding of specific significant impacts in

17 the areas of agricultural resources from the loss of prime agricultural soils (but not impacts from

18 agricultural incompatibility), regional air quality from the generation of ozone precursors,

19 nuisance odors impacting sensitive human receptors in residences, hospitals, nursing homes and

20 recreational facilities (but not agricultural operations, agricultural production or processing

21 facilities, or agricultural product on-site retail facilities), and greenhouse gases, noise, and

22 transportation. Although the PEIR concluded that most of the significant impacts identified in

23 the PEIR were unavoidable and could not be mitigated, several mitigation measures were

24 identified. Mitigation measures proposed to address, but not eliminate these Class impacts

25 largely consist of conditions that would apply to individual cannabis permits to reduce the

26 impact "to the extent feasible".

27 29. When the PEIR was certified, the County's Uniform Rules for Agricultural Preserves and

28 Farmland Security Zones (referred to as "Uniform Rules") did not allow cannabis activities on

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 7 Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Castlerock)

1 parcels subject to an Agricultural Preserve contract. The County's Agricultural Preserve

2 Advisory Committee ("APAC")  conducted an extensive review of how to integrate cannabis

3 with other agricultural activities and the County's Agricultural Preserve Program during the

4 time that the PEIR was being considered and the Cannabis Ordinance being developed. While

5 the PEIR recognized that the Uniform Rules would be amended to allow cannabis activities in

6 some form, the PEIR's analysis was based on the options being considered by the APAC at the

7 time, all of which assumed that cannabis would be designated a "compatible" use (meaning

8 commercial production of a non-cannabis agricultural commodity was also required for the
parcel to be eligible for participation in the County's Agricultural Preserve Program) and not a

10 use that itself qualifies as commercial production of an agricultural commodity that in turn

11 made cannabis cultivation "eligible" for participation in the County's Agricultural Preserve

12 Program. The PEIR's analysis of agricultural impacts relied on APAC's review of cannabis

13 applications on lands within the Agricultural Preserve program to affirmatively determine that

14 the cannabis activities would be compatible with both other agricultural activities on the parcel

15 on which the cannabis was proposed and also compatible with agricultural production on lands

16
B adjacent to and nearby the cannabis activity parcel that were enrolled in the County's

17 Agricultural Preserve program.

18 30. At the time that the PEIR was certified and the Cannabis Ordinance adopted, the Board of

19 Supervisors received from County staff a summary of the Cannabis Ordinance amendments and

20 related amendments in a Board Letter. As part of the materials presented to the Board, a

21 detailed list of APAC's recommendations for Uniform Rules amendments regarding cannabis

22 was provided. The Board Letter included APAC's recommended amendments to the Uniform

23 Rules: "Specify that cannabis cultivation and ancillary facilities in support of cannabis

24 cultivation are compatible uses on contracted land." County staff included a draft resolution for a

25

26 The County's Agricultural Preserve Advisory Committee (*APAC") is responsible for administering the County's Agricultural Preserve Program and the Uniform Rules. Its duties include reviewing applications and making 27 recommendations for creating agricultural preserves, entering new contracts, making revisions to existing preserves or contracts, termination of contracts and disestablishing preserves. In conjunction with these duties, the APAC is
28 responsible for monitoring and enforcement of the Agricultural Preserve Program, including by conducting the foregoing compatibility review for proposed projects is where the proposed use is deemed "compatible" under the Uniform Rules.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 8 Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Castlerock)

the Board to exclude cannabis cultivation from the Uniform Rules' definition of "agricultural

2 use" and "agricultural commodity", per APAC's recommendation after numerous public
hearings on the topic. The Board did not take action on the Uniform Rules and Williamson Act

4 issues at the time they certified the PEIR and approved the Cannabis Ordinance, deferring that

5 topic to a future hearing.

6 31. At the time the PEIR was certified, APAC's recommendation was that the Uniform Rules
should be revised to classify cannabis as a "compatible use" and allow cannabis cultivation
within or outside, the designated development envelope of a premises, but the land dedicated to

9 cannabis cultivation outside of the development envelope could not exceed 5% of the premises

10 5 or 5 acres, whichever is less. The PEIR's analysis of the Cannabis Ordinance impacts on

11 Williamson Act contracted land also assumed the Uniform Rules would be amended to allow

12 certain cannabis activities as "compatible uses" on lands that are subject Agricultural Preserve

13 contracts, but that cannabis cultivation would not be subject to acreage limitations, provided

14 that the property owner complies with the minimum cultivation of non-cannabis crops and/or

15 grazing requirements of the Uniform Rules. The only alternative analysis in the PEIR is

16 "Alternative 2 - Preclusion of Cannabis Activities from Williamson Act Land Alternative",

17 which (like APAC's recommendation and the PEIR's project analysis) also analyzed a scenario

18 where cannabis is classified as a "compatible use". but the canopy is limited to one outdoor

19 cannabis cultivation license of 22,000 square feet from the California Department of Food &

20 Agriculture. Both the PEIR's Proposed Project Description and Alternative 2 assumed cannabis

21 would be treated as a "compatible use" by the Uniform Rules.

22 32. On March 20, 2018, the County Board of Supervisors rejected the APAC'S

23 recommendations and amended the County's Uniform Rules to define cannabis cultivation as

24 commercial production of an agricultural commodity on lands subject to Agricultural Preserve

25 contracts and thus allow cannabis activities to qualify as "eligible" uses of Williamson Act

26 contracted lands. The Board's decision to amend the Uniform Rules to define cannabis

27 cultivation as commercial production of an agricultural commodity on lands subject to

28 Agricultural Preserve contracts was at odds with the recommendation of the APAC, defied the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 9
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Castlerock)

1 recommendation of County staff that cannabis be considered a "compatible" use, conflicted

2. with the Board Letter and the then-proposed draft Uniform Rules amendments presented in the

3 materials for the February 6, 2018 hearing during which the PEIR was certified, and conflicted

4 with the PEIR's analysis (and alternatives) that all relied on APAC's review of cannabis

5 operations' compatibility with present and adjacent Williamson Act contracted lands to ensure

6 compatibility between cannabis activities and agricultural activities on Williamson Act

7 contracted lands. Although the County has claimed that APAC conducts compatibility review

8 of individual cannabis projects notwithstanding the Board's March 2018 decision to define

9 cannabis as commercial production of an agricultural commodity on Williamson Act contracted

10 lands, that review is limited to assessing the non-cultivation aspects of the cannabis use, and

11 there was no compatibility review conducted by APAC for the Project. APAC's review process

12 does not review, and did not consider for the Project, whether the cultivation of cannabis is

13 compatible with non-cannabis agricultural uses on the parcel, or separately "ensure" that

14 cannabis cultivation activities would not conflict with other adjacent and nearby properties and

15 farming operations subject to Williamson Act contracts. The PEIR relied on APAC's

3 16 established processes for reviewing the compatibility of land uses to mitigate any

17 incompatibility between existing agriculture and cannabis cultivation - after the Uniform Rules

18 were amended, this review does not occur for cannabis cultivation, and there was no

19 compatibility review conducted by APAC for the Project. As a result, the Project's

20 incompatibility with surrounding and nearby agricultural operations was not considered, the

21 impacts identified, and alternatives and mitigation measures evaluated.

22 33. The Project site is a 277-acre agriculturally zoned parcel adjacent to the Santa Ynez

23 River, accessed from Highway 246, west of the City of Buellton. The property has historically

24 been the site of various agricultural activities, and is subject to Williamson Act Agricultural

25 Preserve Contract No. 83AP013. The property is visible from Highway 246 to the north and

26 Santa Rosa Road to the south. Cannabis was previously cultivated on the site creating

27 significant odors that were experienced at a number of off-site locations, but Petitioner is

28 informed and on that basis believes that cannabis cultivation is not currently occurring on the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 10
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Castlerock)

1 Project parcel. The permit would authorize approximately 23 acres of cannabis activities on the

2 site. The surrounding and nearby agricultural properties are also under Williamson Act

3 contracts and engage in agricultural activities, including vineyards, wineries and tasting areas.

4 34. The Project is located in an area that has been designated by the United States

5 Department of the Treasury as the Sta. Rita Hills American Viticultural Area ("AVA"). Wines

6 produced in the Sta. Rita Hills AVA may display this as an appellation, increasing the value of

7 wine produced there, both in terms of consumer perception and price point. The Santa Ynez

8 Valley generally and the Sta. Rita Hills AVA specifically are well-known nationally and
internationally as a wine-producing and tasting region, drawing thousands of visitors weekly
10 and providing an essential customer base that enables the success of the Santa Ynez Valley

11 wine industry. Those wineries that produce and sell their own wines in the Sta. Rita Hills AVA

12 rely heavily on sale of wines directly to the consumer ("DTC" sales) where the winery sells its

13 wine at or near retail prices both directly from the winery's tasting area and through shipments

14 to the consumer's home. Essential to successful DTC sales is the maintenance of a tasting

15 facility so prospective customers may sample wines produced by a winery, often for the purpose

16 of selecting wines to purchase by the case to take home. Successful wineries develop and

17 maintain the allegiance of a clientele of dedicated customers through wine clubs and

18 memberships that drive DTC sales for years after a customer's visit to a winery. Most wineries,

19 including wineries most proximate to the Project, have carefully created pleasant outdoor areas

20 for wine tasting activities to occur due to COVID.

21 35. Wine is a very complex beverage, with flavors and characteristics carefully cultivated to

22 reflect the flavor of the land, known as terroir. "Tasting" wine depends significantly on the

23 sense of smell. Tasting areas need clean air that is not dominated by external odors for a

24 sophisticated wine taster and prospective wine customer to discern the subtle features and

25 elements of the wine that are important to the decision to make a purchase. The presence of

26 strong external odors can conflict materially with the success of a winery and the ability of

27 prospective customers to fully experience wines. If the odor is pervasive at a particular winery,

28 prospective purchasers often elect to not taste wines and go to other wineries, substantially

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 11
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Castlerock)

1 reducing the revenues needed for local wineries to be economically successful. When a

2 prospective purchaser tastes wine at a tasting area that has strong odors, such as from cannabis,
3 they cannot discern many of the subtle and complex aspects of the terroir and can conclude that

4 wine is unworthy of purchase. If a winery cannot generate revenues sufficient to pay expenses

5 and yield a profit in at least some years, a cascading series of factors can lead to a winery's

6 failure. If enough wineries fail, the agricultural support services and expertise needed to

7 support a local viticulture-based agricultural economy become more expensive and less

8 available, resulting in wineries failing and/or leaving the area, leading to widespread closures

9 failures. Widespread closures and abandonment of wineries in Santa Barbara County will lead

10 to vineyard failures and the fallowing or agricultural lands, or conversion of valuable

11 agricultural land to other nonagricultural uses, which in turn can lead to additional conflicts

12 with cannabis.

13 36. The cultivation and production of commercial-scale cannabis generates strong odors, and

14 the winds and meteorology of the Santa Ynez Valley and Project area transport odors beyond

15 .4 the Project property lines. Depending on the wind, time of day, humidity, the presence of

16 inversion and other meteorological conditions, odors from the Project may be transported to

17 facilities and areas used in wine tasting and wine compositional analysis and blending, making

18 these procedures more difficult and activities less desirable.

19 37. In addition to the Project, currently, there are seventeen (17) pending outdoor cannabis

20 cultivation projects in the Santa Rita Valley area that are pending approval or that have been

21 approved (and appealed), averaging 33 acres each, totaling approximately 570 acres. For
22 context, Sonoma County has capped cannabis cultivation at 1 acre per parcel, with 88 growers

23 currently operating, totaling 88 acres countywide. These seventeen Santa Barbara County

24 cannabis projects in the Santa Rita Valley total 570 acres of outdoor cannabis cultivation, or

25 36% of Santa Barbara County's 1,575 acres cannabis production cap. Cannabis cultivation
26 projects proposed in the Santa Rita Valley area represent 52% of the total 1,100 acres of
27 cannabis estimated as needed to supply the demand of the entire State of California. Due to its

28 status under federal law, interstate transportation and sale of cannabis is prohibited.

1 38. On June 21, 2019, APAC reviewed the Project and the Williamson Act contract for

2 consistency with the Uniform Rules, finding Williamson Act contract 78-AP-023 "meets the

3 Uniform Rules ongoing eligibility requirements." APAC did not evaluate the proposed

4 cultivation under the principles of compatibility as envisioned by and relied on in the PEIR nor

5 evaluate or consider the compatibility of the Project with nearby agricultural uses, including the

6 effect that Project odor would have on nearby tasting areas and winery operations.

7 39. The County Planning and Development Director approved the LUP application (Case No,

8 19LUP-00000-00064) on July 26, 2019. Petitioner is informed, and based on County

9 communications and practice, believes that Planning and Development staff prepared the State

10 CEQA Guidelines Section 15168(c)(4) Checklist for Commercial Cannabis Land Use

11 Entitlement and Licensing Applications, after the Project was approved and the initial appeal

12 was filed, depriving the decisionmaker and the public the benefit of any Project-specific

13 environmental review process and improperly deferring CEQA compliance if and when an

14 appeal is filed. The post-hoc CEQA Checklist determined that all of the environmental impacts

15 of Castlerock's proposed cannabis operation would be within the scope of the PEIR. However,

16 instead of evaluating whether the Castlerock Project would have effects that were not examined

17 in the program EIR as required, the Checklist only addresses whether the project involves

18 "sensitive or unusual environmental characteristics, or require[s] unusual development

19 activities", with enumerated examples of "construction of a bridge over a riparian corridor that

20 supports listed species protected under the Federal or California endangered species acts",

21 "structural development that cannot be screened from a public viewing location pursuant to the

22 requirements of PEIR mitigation measure MM AV-1" and "development activities that will

23 have a significant impact on cultural resources which cannot be mitigated to a less-than-

24 significant level", for which County staff checked "no" and conducted no further impact

25 analysis, alternatives analysis or consideration of mitigation measures.

26 40. One of Petitioner's supporters, a nearby winery owner, timely appealed the Director's

27 approval of 19LUP-00000-00050 to the Planning Commission. A hearing was held on July 8,

28 2019, and shortly before the hearing, the applicant modified the Project Description. Over the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 13 Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Castlerock)

1 course of the hearing, the Planning Commission considered evidence in the record, statements

2 given by the Appellant and the Applicant, and public testimony. The Planning Commission

3 then approved the revised Project. Petitioner appealed.

4 41. Both in its testimony to the Planning Commission and in its appeal to the Board of

5 Supervisors, Petitioner and its members and supporters raised and presented substantial

6 evidence supporting arguments that Project approval would violate CEQA, and challenging the

7 adequacy of LUP approval findings based on inconsistencies with the County's LUDC and

8 Comprehensive Plan including the Agricultural Element, agricultural compatibility, CEQA and

9 odors.

10 42. The Board of Supervisors heard the Petitioner's appeal and approved the Project on

11 October 6, 2020. During the Supervisor's hearing, additional revisions to the Project

12 Description were made, including a change that consolidated Project harvests into a shorter total
13 period, potentially intensifying odor emissions, after the appellant completed its presentation

14 and the public hearing was closed. Counsel for Petitioner sought to object, by "raising hand" in

15
w the Zoom proceeding and emailing staff, but was not recognized or given the opportunity to
raise objections to this last-minute change to the Project. The County's Notice of

17 Determination was filed on October 15, 2020.

18 43. Respondents have abused their discretion and have failed to comply with the law in the

19 following ways:

21 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

22 (Violations of CEQA: Pub. Res. Code §§ 21000, et seq.)

23 A. Failure to conduct Project-specific Analysis; checklist Inadequacy

24 44. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 43 as if fully set forth

25 herein.

26 45. Respondents abused their discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by CEQA

27 by approving the Castlerock Cannabis Cultivation Project in reliance on the PEIR for the

28 County's Cannabis Ordinance, without conducting either adequate site-specific environmental

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 14
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Castlerock)

$/:

1 review required by Guidelines § 15168 or subsequent environmental review pursuant to Public

2 Resources Code section 21166 and section 21094.

3 46. After a Program EIR has been prepared, later activities like this Project must be

4 examined in light of the Program EIR to determine whether additional environmental review is

5 necessary. (Pub. Res. Code § 21094; CEQA Guidelines? § 15168 (c).) If the Project would

6 have effects that were not examined in the PEIR, a new Initial Study would need to be prepared

7 specifically for this Project, leading to either an EIR or a Negative Declaration. (Id.). CEQA

8 Guidelines § 15168 (c) does not limit this review to considering only whether "unusual

9 environmental characteristics or development activities" exist, as the County's Checklist

10 provides. /

11 47. The PEIR was prepared for the Cannabis Ordinance and Licensing program. The PEIR

12 recognized that the Cannabis Ordinance and Licensing program as scoped for environmental

13 review would have at least twelve independent significant adverse impacts countywide, but

14 narrowly assessed specific impacts and identified only limited mitigation measures, concluding

15 that these significant impacts would be overridden by the Program's benefits.

16 48. The PEIR did not identify, consider, or address the Castlerock Project, or any other

17 specific cannabis project. There was no specific evaluation of the Castlerock site conditions,

18 the project characteristics and activities, and of the conditions and activities on surrounding and

19 nearby properties. It did not identify the proximity to the Santa Ynez River, the location of

20 other proximate agricultural operations, including wineries or tasting areas, the significance of

21 wines produced in the Sta. Rita Hills AVA, the locations of other cannabis operations, the wind

22 conditions and meteorology of the Castlerock site, the size and nature of the Castlerock

23 operation, techniques for reducing odors or site-specific or project-specific information.

24 49. The "CEQA Checklist" prepared after the Planning and Development Department

25 Director's approval, or as part of the approval of the Castlerock Project, did not adequately

26 document an evaluation of the site or the activities authorized by the permit to determine

27 whether the environmental effects of the operation were within the scope of the PEIR.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 15
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Castlerock)

1 Guidelines §§ 15168(c)(4) & (5). Instead, the CEQA Checklist simply listed certain mitigation

2 measures that were identified for the Cannabis Ordinance and Licensing Program and entailed a

3 check whether each specific mitigation measure applied, and asked whether the Project involves

4 "unusual characteristics or development activities". This does not constitute the necessary

5 project-specific supplemental analysis required to determine whether a project-specific

6 entitlement was within the scope of the PEIR and whether the project itself entails potentially

7 significant impacts that were not specifically considered in the PEIR.

8 50. The County did not prepare the CEQA Checklist to inform decisionmakers or the public

9 prior to the Director's approval of the Land Use Permit, but instead prepared the Checklist well

10 after the initial approval, and in response to appeals, representing improper after-the-fact CEQA

11 compliance.

12 51. The Castlerock CEQA Checklist is inadequate to comply with CEQA.

13 B. Effects Not Examined in Programmatic Environmental Impact Report

14 52. The PEIR relied on the APAC compatibility determination process under the Uniform

L 15 Rules to identify and avoid significant incompatibilities between cannabis and conventional

16 crops, such as wine grapes. APAC provides an established process and the Uniform Rules

17 define clear standards for determining compatibility among agricultural uses and commodities.

18 The potential for loss of a contracted properties' tax benefits is a powerful incentive to manage

19 and avoid incompatibilities both on the cannabis parcel and on other Williamson Act contracted

20 parcels adjacent and nearby.

21 53. The PEIR did not examine the effect of cannabis' designation as an agricultural

22 commodity and thus an eligible use on the Castlerock Project parcel. As an eligible use,

23 cannabis and its odors are incompatible with conventional agriculture and its supportive uses that

24 depend on odor-free air quality - such as sampling and tasting of wines for Direct to Consumer

25 (DTC) sales and winemakers' blending of wines. The presence of cannabis odors impairs

26 winetasting, and in some instances can wholly prevent winetasting at a site a altogether, such as

27 negative on-line customer reviews that found the location objectionable due to odors. Blending

28 and the creation of premium wines requires ongoing tasting by the winemaker, and the presence

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 16
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Castlerock)

1 of strong malodors can prevent successful wine characterization and creation. The closure of

2 tasting areas because of cannabis odors and unsuccessful vintages can undermine a winery's

3 economic success and lead to closure of the winery, and a cascade of subsequent adverse a effects

4 culminating with the abandonment of vineyards.

5 54. Reciprocally, the PEIR did not examine the conflict arising when conventional

6 agriculturalists seek to apply chemical pesticides, even certified organic pesticides, that are

7 impermissible under state law if detected on cannabis plants. Legally applied pesticides may still

8 migrate or "lift and drift" onto adjacent properties, and this is a common phenomenon. Conflicts
have arisen where a cannabis grower demands their conventional farming neighbor to alter their

10 practices or face potentially astronomical damages for loss of the cannabis crop. The PEIR

11 relied on the APAC compatibility analysis, but when the Uniform Rules were changed, that

12 analysis evaporated, however this conflict persists, including at the Castlerock Project property.

13 C. Changed Circumstances

14 55. Subsequent environmental review is required where "substantial changes occur with

15 respect to the circumstances under which the project is undertaken, which will require major

16 revisions of the previous EIR due to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or

17 a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects." (CEQA

18 § Guidelines § 15162 (a)(1-2); Pub. Res. Code § 21166 (a-b).)

19 56. The Board's designation of cannabis as an agricultural commodity and thus an eligible

20 use not subject to the Uniform Rules' compatibility a analysis is a material change in
21 circumstances that involves new significant environmental effects and/or a substantial increase in

22 the severity of the impacts associated with incompatibility between cannabis and conventional

23 agriculture, both with regard to cannabis odor impacts on winemaking and winetasting, and

24 conventional farming activities.

25 57. The Board's determination that cannabis is not entitled to local Right to Farm protections

26 and the discovery of new, specific examples of odor control that is feasible and being

27 implemented on AG-II parcels in the Santa a Ynez Valley is a changed circumstance requiring

28 revision to the PEIR. The PEIR initially established that all cannabis cultivation operation

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 17
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Castlerock)

1 should be subjected to odor control, but then exempted AG-II lands from all odor control "due to

2 the innate need for protection of agricultural land." PEIR, MM AQ-5. Since that time, odor

3 control has been required a on a number of AG-II cannabis cultivation projects, including a newly

4 expanded number of cannabis projects requiring Conditional Use Permits - which require odor

5 control, even on AG-II lands - without impacting the protection of agricultural lands. The

6 Castlerock applicant themselves developed a cursory (and ineffective) Odor Abatement Plan as a

7 "voluntary" submittal, demonstrating changed circumstances that invalidates the PEIR's reliancel

8 on an "innate need for protection" of AG-II agricultural lands as a basis for exemption from odor

9 control otherwise found necessary in the PEIR. Combined with the Uniform Rules changes, the

10 County's experience with its ordinance and the applicant's actions collectively (and individually)

11 identify a significantly changed circumstances that AG-II properties seeking to cultivate

12 cannabis can install and maintain odor control programs without jeopardizing the protection of
13 agricultural lands. These Changed Circumstances preclude the County's exclusive reliance on

14 the PEIR and flawed CEQA Checklist and necessitate Project-specific environmental review.

: 15 D. New Information of Substantial Importance

Th 16 58. Subsequent environmental review is required if new information of substantial

17 importance, which was not known and could not have been known with the exercise of

18 reasonable diligence at the time the previous EIR was certified shows that: a) the project will

19 have one or more significant effects not discussed in the previous EIR or negative declaration; b)

20 significant effects previously examined will be substantially more severe than shown in the

21 previous EIR; c) mitigation measures or alternatives previously found not to be feasible would in

22 fact be feasible, and would substantially reduce one or more significant effects of the project, but

23 the project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative; or d) mitigation

24 measures or alternatives which are considerably different from those analyzed in the previous

25 EIR would substantially reduce one or more significant effects on the environment, but the

26 project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative. (CEQA Guidelines §

27 15162 (a)(3); Pub. Res. Code § 21166 (c).)

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 18
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Castlerock)

1

1 59. In written and oral testimony before the Planning Commission and the Board of
Supervisors, Petitioner and others presented substantial evidence of new and substantially

3 increased significant environmental effects, resulting from post-PEIR certification changes to
the County's Uniform Rules for Agricultural Preserves, changes to the County's Right to Farm
ordinance, changes to the threshold in the Land Use and Development Code for Conditional Use

6 Permits, and thus the odor control requirement threshold on AG-II lands.

60. New information disclosed that the Project will have significant impacts to agricultural

8 compatibility and the protection of agricultural viability, as ensured by Goal 1 of the

9 Agricultural Element, from odors in wineries and tasting areas and from threats and actions by

10 cannabis cultivators preventing continuation of conventional and organic agriculture and

11 necessitating less effective pest control methods, increased spraying and applications of these

12 less effective methods, crop damage, infestations and the failure of conventional agriculture and

13 concomitant blight.

14 61. New information disclosed that significant effects to the County's Agricultural Preserve

15 Program and thus to agricultural viability will be substantially more severe, including the threats

16 to the viability of farming and winery operations, than considered in the PEIR. The PEIR relied/

17 on APAC's expert compatibility analysis to avoid or reduce the severity of these impacts to

18 agriculture on- and off-site, but the new information eviscerated that review process and

19 replaced it with a simple eligibility test under the Uniform Rules. Consequently, the Project's

20 impacts to nearby agriculture will be substantially more severe than they would be had

21 compatibility been required.

22 62. New information has arisen establishing the fact that odor control on AG-II cannabis

23 operations are feasible and does not threaten agricultural protection, and would instead enhance

24 agricultural protection and the long-term viability of agriculture by the mitigation of conflicts

25 among what would otherwise be incompatible activities.

26 E. New Information Regarding Removal of APAC's Compatibility Analysis

27 63. To address potential adverse effects of incompatibility between cannabis and adjacent

28 agricultural crops, the PEIR relied on APAC review under the Uniform Rules to ensure

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 19
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Castlerock)

1 compatibility with agricultural uses, and to ensure that "cannabis activities would not conflict

2 with properties that are subject to Williamson Act contract." *Subsequent revisions to the

3 Uniform Rules after PEIR certification classified cannabis cultivation as commercial production

4 of an agricultural commodity, eliminating the compatibility review relied on in the PEIR to

5 protect neighboring agricultural operations and to mitigate significant impacts to agriculture

6 resulting from conflicts with existing zoning for agricultural use, Agricultural Preserve contracts

7 pursuant to the Williamson Act, or the conversion of farmland to non-agricultural use. The

8 provision for APAC compatibility review is the only means identified in the PEIR that purports

9 to address conflicts between neighboring agricultural operations including the effects of
10 pesticide migration from legacy farming operations onto cannabis, which has a zero a tolerance

11 for pesticides, including most pesticides approved for organic use. The PEIR did not anticipate,

12 and thus evaluate in its principal analysis or Alternative 2, the impacts if cannabis would be

13 defined as commercial production of an agricultural commodity and thus included in the

14 minimum production requirements in the Uniform Rules for commercial production of

15 "agricultural commodities." The PEIR could not and did not analyze the impacts of this new

16: classification either to existing agriculture generally or to Williamson Act contracted lands

17 specifically. Lastly, the PEIR could not and did not analyze the effect of the changed definition

18 on the County's ability to mitigate the impacts of individual cannabis cultivation projects. In

19 short, the Uniform Rules revisions eliminated a critical procedural and substantive element of

20 ensuring compatibility between cannabis cultivation projects and adjacent conventional

21 agricultural uses, rendering that portion of the PEIR and Alternative 2 moot, and thus

22 unavailable to serve as permit-level environmental review for this issue.

23 64. Due to this change in circumstances, Castlerock's proposed cannabis cultivation was not

24 reviewed by APAC for compatibility with the Agricultural Preserve contracts held by adjacent

25 and nearby landowners (many contracts in place for 50+ years) including 83AP012, 83AP013,

26 84AP018, 70AP006, 69AP056, 69AP005, and others.

27 65. Substantial evidence of new and substantially increased impacts to agriculture resulting

28 from the post-PEIR certification Uniform Rules amendment was presented to County

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 20
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis County of Santa Barbara (Castlerock)

- A2

decisionmakers. This substantial evidence includes testimony of the Grower-Shipper

2 Association of Santa Barbara-San Luis Obispo Counties regarding conflicts with neighboring

3 agricultural properties under Agricultural Preserve, including a documented conflict that

4 occurred between another nearby cannabis cultivator and adjacent agricultural operation (one of

5 the Grower Shipper Association members) regarding pesticide application at the nearby Busy

6 Bee Site.

66. Further, the California Farm Bureau Federation provided a letter to the Board of

8 Supervisors confirming January 1, 2020 amendments to the Williamson Act are declaratory

9 statements of the State's rejection of cannabis as an "agricultural commodity," ineligible to

10 qualify for a Williamson Act contract, and underscoring the importance of compatibility review

11 of cannabis on Williamson Act lands. The Planning Commission's findings that the nearby

12 Westcoast Farms Project had the potential to conflict with agricultural operations on

13 neighboring properties, based on facts and their expertise, constitutes additional substantial

14 evidence.

15 F. New Information Regarding "Lift and Drift" Pesticide Migration and Impacts to

16 Conventional Agriculture

17 67. New information of substantial importance, which was not known and could not have

18 been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the PEIR was certified, has

19 become available showing that the Project will have substantially increased impacts to

20 agriculture as consequence of pesticide migration. Specifically, the occurrence of migration

21 of pesticide waft, or "lift and drift" that can occur after lawful applications of pesticides, in

22 conjunction with the prohibition on pesticides or insecticides in cannabis, including most

23 commonly used organically-certified pesticides, will likely result in the conversion of farmland

24 to non-agricultural uses when conventional agriculture becomes impossible or uneconomical.

25 68. After the PEIR's certification, substantial evidence has come forward showing that

26 commercial, third-party pesticide applicators (used for decades and necessary for much of the

27 County's economically productive avocado, grape and citrus production) have refused to apply

28 materials to either conventional or organic avocado and citrus crops due to incompatibility with
nearby cannabis cultivation operations. Thresholds for cannabis are as little as one microgram

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 21
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Castlerock)

per gram, or 0.1 part per million. Other farmers in Santa Barbara County, in at least two

2 instances, have lost crops after switching to other less effective pest management products to

3 reduce potential liability from the legal application of pesticides after threats of legal action by

4 cannabis operators. The conflict has manifested already between a cannabis cultivation

5 operation in the Project's immediate vicinity and one of its farming neighbors, who had their

6 pest control applicator threatened for using materials essential to their agricultural production.

7 Furthermore, the County received testimony of the now-known severity of this impact from the

8 Grower-Shipper Association (reporting the experience of their members reflecting cannabis'

9 incompatibility with organic and conventional Central Coast agriculture) and Santa Barbara

10 County Agricultural Advisory Committee ("AAC"), asking for delay in Board action pending

11 ordinance revisions and if not, imposition of additional Project conditions "to address

12 predictable conflicts that have arisen in many situations in the County". New evidence was

13 presented that conventional farms nearby existing and proposed cannabis cultivation sites are

14 unable to produce economically viable crops due to cannabis cultivators' threats, which have

,15 chilled pest control applicators from providing pest control services to sites near cannabis

16 cultivations. The Project will cause these farms to cease production and potentially go out of

17 business, creating blight and facilitating the collapse of the wine industry and food production in

18 the vicinity of the Project and elsewhere in Santa Barbara County, with secondary impacts to

1.9 hospitality facilities in wine country. The Planning Commission's findings, based on facts and

20 their expertise, constitutes additional substantial evidence that the potential for pesticide

21 migration may significantly impact the long-term viability of agriculture in the Project area.

22 69. New information of substantial importance that was not known and could not have been

23 known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time of the PEIR certification establishes

24 that the project will have more significant impacts than identified in the PEIR, that impacts

25 considered in the PEIR will be more severe than shown, and that both previously-rejected and

26 new mitigation measures and alternatives are now feasible. Under these circumstances, CEQA

27 requires project-specific environmental review prior to the Board's approval of the Project.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS 22
Santa Barbara Coalition for Responsible Cannabis v. County of Santa Barbara (Castlerock)

1 70. The record before the Board lacked substantial evidence showing that these

2 environmental impacts were included in the PEIR. The failure of the Board to consider the

3 substantially changed circumstances and new information as they approved the Project is an
abuse of discretion and failure to follow procedures required by law.

5 G. Cumulative Impacts

6 71. There are five other proposed or approved cannabis projects on parcels adjacent to or one

7 parcel removed from the Project parcel, over a dozen within a two mile radius and dozens

8 between the Cities of Lompoc and Buellton, and in the Sta Rita Hills AVA. The PEIR does not
9 analyze or examine the severity of the cumulative impacts of the Project in addition to the other.
10 cannabis projects proposed or operational in the vicinity of the project, and the cumulative
11 effect that the Project - plus other cannabis cultivation projects in the vicinity • will have on
12 existing agricultural operations in the area, including wineries and wine tasting areas, between
13 Buellton and Lompoc along Highway 246 and the Santa Ynez River. The PEIR does not
14 analyze the severity of the cumulative effect of this specific Project's odors in addition to the
15 odors generated by other proposed and approved cannabis cultivation projects in the Project
16 vicinity upon the wineries and tasting areas in the Sta. Rita Hills AVA: Further, the majority of
17 the land in the Sta. Rita Hills AVA and other areas where cannabis projects are proposed are

18 subject to Williamson Act contracts, implicating cumulative CEQA issues discussed previously

19 with regard to the Uniform Rules and conflicts with State law. Specifically, the PEIR failed to
20 identify or examine the potential cumulative impact to agriculture including from agricultural

21 incompatibility, pesticide migration, or odor-based preclusion of wine tasting associated with

22 this intensity of cannabis cultivation in this important wine producing region, including for this

23 Project. Similarly, the CEQA Checklist for the Project does not examine these potentially
24 significant cumulative impacts. Discussed above, new information revealed substantial
25 evidence of these impacts. No substantial evidence exists showing these impacts were
26 addressed in the PEIR. Accordingly, additional environmental review is required.
27 72. For all the above reasons, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion and failed to
28 proceed in accordance with CEQA.
