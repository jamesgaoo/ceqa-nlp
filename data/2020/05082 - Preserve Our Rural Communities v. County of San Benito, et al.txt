1 INTRODUCTION

2 With this lawsuit, Petitioner PRESERVE OUR RURAL COMMUNITIES (PORC)

3 challenges the April 7, 2020 actions by Respondents SAN BENITO COUNTY and SAN

4 BENITO COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS (County) adopting an addendum to an
5 environmental impact report (EIR) previously certified in 2015 under the California

6 Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) for the County's 2035 General Plan, and enacting

7 Ordinance No. 1008 rezoning certain rural, undeveloped lands owned by Real Parties In Interest

8 THOMAS JOHN MCDOWELL AND VICTORIA MCDOWELL CHARITABLE

9 REMAINDER UNITRUST (McDowell) from Agricultural Rangeland use to "Commercial
10 Thoroughfare (C-1)" use ("Ordinance 1008 or "Project"), thereby authorizing large retail
11 businesses, hotels, outdoor advertising signage, drive-through restaurants, car-washes, and
12 private golf, tennis, and country clubs.
13 PORC contends the County prejudicially abused its discretion by erroneously
14 characterizing Ordinance 1008 as merely implementing the 2035 General Plan, and thereby
15 relying on an addendum to a previously certified EIR, rather than preparing a new or subsequent

16 EIR to evaluate previously undisclosed environmental impacts resulting from the newly
17 authorized commercial land uses. Substantial evidence in the County's administrative record

18 shows the Project will have new significant impacts that were never disclosed, evaluated, or
19 mitigated in the 2015 General Plan EIR, and that other impacts that were addressed in the earlier

20 document will be more severe than disclosed or will require additional mitigation. Substantial
21 evidence in the record also shows that underlying circumstances have changed substantially since
22 2015, resulting in new and/or more severe significant impacts than were considered in the
23 General Plan EIR. PORC further contends the County engaged in unlawful project segmentation
24 or "piecemealing" in violation of CEQA by failing to disclose or evaluate environmental impacts
25 from foreseeable commercial development projects planned for the rezoned lands.

26 PORC accordingly seeks a peremptory writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedute
27 section 1094.5 commanding the County to set aside its approvals of the Project. PORC further
28 seeks a stay of the effect of the County's approvals during the pendency of these proceedings.

1 Finally, PORC seeks an award of costs and attorneys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure section

2 1021.5, together with any other relief the Court deems necessary and proper. :

3 In support whereof, PORC alleges:
4 PARTIES

5 Preserve Out Rural Communities

6 1. Petitioner PORC is a tax-exempt, California non-profit public benefit corporation
7 headquartered in Aromas, San Benito County. PORC's corporate purposes include: (a)
8 developing, advocating and defending legislation, regulations, and programs that preserve San

9 Benito County's agricultural lands; (b) acting to protect the rural character of communities in the
10 County from traffic and excessive development; (c) protecting water, wildlife, and other natural

11 resources in the County; and (d) conducting research and publicizing the positions of elected
12 officials concerning these issues.

13 2. PORC and its constituents maintain a direct and regular geographic nexus with
14 San Benito County in general, and the commercial node areas in particular, and will suffer direct
15 harm as a result of any adverse caused by the County's unlawful actions.
16 3. PORC has a clear and present right to, and beneficial interest in, the County's
17 performance of its duties to comply with CEQA, and PORC is within the class of entities to
18 whom the County owes such duties.

19 4. PORC and/or its constituents presented oral and written comments in opposition
20 to the Projects prior to and/or duting public hearings culminating in the County Board of
21 Supervisors' April 7, 2020 final approval actions, and raised or supported all objections to the

22 Project and alleged grounds for noncompliance with applicable law as presented herein.
23 County of San Benito

24 5. Respondent County is a political subdivision of the State of California. It is
25 responsible for regulating land use in the unincorporated area of its territory, and has a
26 mandatory duty to implement and comply with CEQA in fulfilling this responsibility. At all

27 times relevant herein, the County served as the "lead agency" under CEQA responsible for
28 evaluating the potential environmental impacts of the Project before approving it.

1 San Benito County Board of Supervisors

2 6. Respondent Board of Supervisors is the duly elected legislative decisionmaking

3 body of the County. As such, it is charged with the ultimate responsibility to implement and

4 comply with the provisions of CEQA in carrying out the County's land use regulatory authority.
5 Thomas John McDowell and Victoria McDowell Charitable Remainder Unittust

6 7. PORC is informed and believes that Real Party In Interest Thomas John
7 McDowell and Victoria McDowell Charitable Remainder Unitrust (*McDowell") is a tax-
8 exempt charitable trust organization organized under section 664 and/or 4947 of the federal
9 Internal Revenue Code, maintaining its principle place of business in Monterey County. It is the
10 owner of the parcels that the County purported to re-zone by adopting the C-1 Ordinance.
11 8. PORC is further informed and believes that McDowell intends to develop the
12 Betabel node area in the future with commercial uses, and is the applicant for and/or primary
13 beneficiary of the County's adoption of Ordinance 1008.
14 Real Party In Interest Does 1 through 25, Inclusive
15 9. PORC currently does not know the true names and capacities of Real Parties In
16 Interest DOES 1 through 25 inclusive, and therefore names them by such fictitious names.
17 PORC will seek leave from the court to amend this petition to reflect the true names and
18 capacities of DOES 1 through 25 inclusive if and when ascertained.
19 JURISDICTION & VENUE
20 10. This action is brought pursuant to the writ of mandate provisions of Code of
21 Civil Procedure section 1094.5. Venue is proper in San Benito County under Code of Civil
22 Procedure section 395.
23 FACTUAL BACKGROUND
24 Project Description
25 11. The Project, referred to as the "Betabel Road Commercial Rezone to Add C-1
26 Combining District for 29 acres," purports to change the zoning classification of approximately
27 29-acres of lands located on the west side of U.S. 101 at the Betabel Road interchange, 9664 and

1 9644 Betabel Road, San Juan Bautista, CA (APN 013-150-017, -018, -024 & -025), from

2 Agricultural Rangeland-Floodplain (AR-FP) to a Thotoughfare Commercial (C-1) Combining
3 District. The rezoning would authorize variety of new commercial uses on the affected lands,

4 including large retail businesses, hotels, outdoor advertising signage, drive-through restaurants,

5 car-washes, and private golf, tennis, and country clubs.

6 Procedural History

7 12. In 2015, the Board of Supervisots adopted the San Benito County 2035 General
8 Plan update ("General Plan"), which identified four rural, undeveloped agricultural and

9 rangeland areas along US 101, labeled "commercial nodes," for future region-serving
10 commercial development. Among these were lands owned by McDowell known as the
11 "Betabel" commercial node, i.e., the Project lands. The General Plan did not, however, identify
12 the specific commercial uses that would be permissible at the Betabel node in the future. The
13 General Plan likewise did not change the underlying Agricultural Rangeland zoning designation
14 for the Betabel node.

15 13. In September 2019 the Board adopted Ordinance 991, which created a new
16 /"Regional Commercial" zoning classification that included, among other elements, a list of
17  newly permissible commercial uses in the four node areas including the Betabel node.
18 14. Immediately after Ordinance 991 was approved, PORC members and volunteers
19 began gathering signatures on a referendum petition to repeal the Ordinance 991, submitting it
20 to the County Elections Official in October 2019. The petition contained enough valid
21 signatures to qualify for a referendum vote on Ordinance 991 during the March 3, 2020
22 statewide election. The Board referred the Ordinance to the ballot for that date.

23 15. In November 2019, despite the pending vote on the referendum, McDowell filed
24 an application with the County to conditionally re-zone its lands in the Betabel node to a
25 different zoning designation, "Commercial Thotoughfare Combining District (C-1)," which
26 allowed for similar commercial, hospitality, and entertainment uses as allowed by Ordinance
27 991. The new re-zoning proposal was crafted so that if the voters upheld Ordinance 991 at the
28

. 4 -

1 ballot, then the re-zoning to C-1 would not occur, but if the voters rejected Ordinance 991, then

2 the lands would be re-zoned to C-1.

3 16. The County's Planning Commission considered the new C-1 Ordinance

4 (Ordinance 1008) at a public hearing on November 2019, where it voted to recommend that the

5 Board adopt Ordinance 1008. The Board thereafter deferred action on the Ordinance until after

6 the March 3, 2020 vote on the referendum of Ordinance 991.

7 17. On March 3, the voters rejected Ordinance 991, with 59.79 percent voting to

8 repeal it.

9 18. On April 7, the Board conducted a final public hearing on Ordinance 1008. Prior

10 to the close of the hearing, PORC members submitted written and oral objections to the
11 Ordinance and to the Board's reliance on an Addendum to the 2015 General Plan EIR in lieu of
12  preparing a subsequent or supplemental EIR under CEQA. Following the hearing, a majority of
13 the Board voted to enact Ordinance 1008 and approve the Project.
14 FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF

15 [Failure to Conduct Independent Environmental Review for New Project]

16 1. PORC here incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs in their entirety.
17 2.
18 CEQA requires a public agency to prepare an EIR whenever it proposes to
apptove or carry out a project that may have one or more significant impacts on the
19 environment. Pub. Resources Code SS 21080, 21100, 21151.
20 3. Where a project for which an EIR has been certified is later modified, or the
21 circumstances under which it is to be carried out change, the lead agency must determine
22 whether to: (a) prepare a subsequent or supplemental EIR; (b) prepare an addendum to the
23 previously certified EIR, or (c) treat the modification as a new project and perform a new,
24 independent environmental review under CEQA.
25 4. The lead agency must prepare a subsequent or supplemental ETR and circulate it
26 for public review and comment prior to approving any post-certification modification to a
27 project if one or more of the following events occurs:

1 "(a) Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major
2 revisions of the [ETR].

3 "(b) Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the
4 project is being undertaken which will require major revisions in the [EIR].

5 "(c) New information, which was not known and could not have been known at

6 the time the [EIR] was certified as complete, becomes available." Pub. Resources Code § 21166; Cal. Code. Regs Title 14 ("CEQA Guidelines"), § 151562.
7
5.
8 If, however, "only minor technical changes or additions are necessary, or none of
the conditions described in [P.R.C. § 21166 and Guidelines § 15162] calling for preparation of a

10 subsequent EIR... have occurred," then thie agency may prepare an addendum to the original

11 EIR, which it need not circulate for public review and comment. Guidelines, § 15164.

6.
12 If, however, the post-certification modifications to the project or the changes in

13 citcumstances are such that the original EIR retains little or no informational value, then the

14 agency must conduct a new, independent environmental review under CEQA.
7.
15 Here, the Project constitutes the establishment by ordinance of a new,

16 comprehensive land use regime at the Betabel node that was never identified, described, or
evaluated in the County's 2035 General Plan EIR.
17
8.
18 The County therefore prejudicially abused its discretion by erroneously finding that

19 Ordinance 1008 constituted a mere implementation action for the 2035 General Plan, thereby

20 failing to conduct a new and independent CEQA analysis before acting to approve.
SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF
21

22 [Failure To Prepare Subsequent EIR]

9.
23 PORC here incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs in their entirety.

10.
24 Even if Ordinance 1008 does not constitute a new project requiring new and

25 independent environmental review, the County erred in approving it in reliance on an addendum

26 to the 2035 General Plan EIR rather than preparing and circulating a subsequent EIR for public
review and comment.

1 individuals raised or affirmed each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition orally or in

2 writing prior to the close of the final public hearing on the Project.

3 INADEQUATE REMEDY AT LAW

4 24. PORC declares that it has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary

5 course of law for the improper action of the County.

6 NEWLY PRODUCED EVIDENCE

7 25. In accordance with Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5(e), PORC may, prior

8 to or during the hearing on this petition, offer additional relevant evidence that could not, in the

10 ATTORNEYS FEES

11 26. PORC is entitled to recover attorneys' fees as provided under Code of Civil

12 Procedure section 1021.5 if it prevails in this action and the Court finds that a significant benefit
13 has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, and that the necessity and
14 burden of private enforcement is such as to make an award of fees appropriate.

15 PRAYER
16 WHEREFORE, PORC prays for entry of judgment as follows:

17 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing the County and its Board of
18 Supervisors:

19 (a) to set aside its actions taken April 7, 2020 adopting an Addendum to the 2015
20 General Plan EIR and approving Ordinance 1008 as described in this petition; and
21 (b) to comply fully with CEQA in any subsequent action or actions taken to approve
22 the Ordinance 1008 as challenged herein

23 2. For an order staying the effect of the County's actions pending the outcome of
24 this proceeding.

25 3. For a preliminary and permanent injunction directing the County to cease and

26 refrain from engaging in any future actions predicated upon the Ordinances challenged herein
27 until the County comes into compliance with applicable law.
28 4. For costs of suit.
