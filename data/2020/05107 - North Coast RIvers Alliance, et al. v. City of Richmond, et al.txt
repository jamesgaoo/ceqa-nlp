27 declaratory and injunctive relief ordering defendant and respondent City of Richmond ("City") to rescind
28 its approvals on or about September 8 and 15, 2020 of the Point Molate Mixed-Use Development Project

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 ("Project").

2 INTRODUCTION

3 1. This is a public interest citizen suit to enforce the California Environmental Quality Act,

4 Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"), the Planning and Zoning Law, Government

5 Code section 65000 et seq. ("PZL"), the California Constitution, the City of Richmond's General Plan

6 and Municipal Code, and the Public Trust Doctrine. CEQA is California's preeminent environmental

7 law. It requires all public agencies to examine the potential adverse impacts of their actions before

8 taking them. It is designed to protect California's extraordinary environmental resources from

9 uninformed and needlessly destructive agency actions. The PZL is California's comprehensive land use

10 planning law that assures that local land use and resource development decisions are consistent with the

11 governing general and specific plans and applicable zoning and environmental protection ordinances.

12 Compliance with the PZL assures that the publicly reviewed and adopted land use goals, policies and

13 programs for each community are honored and implemented rather than ignored and violated.

14 California's Constitution - Article 11, section 5 - invests charter cities, including the City of Richmond,

15 with broad authority to "make and enforce all ordinances and regulations in respect to municipal affairs"

16 subject to the State's general laws as to matters of statewide concern such as the required elements of the

17 general plan. The City may not subvert its constitutionally-based police power by contracting away its

18 discretion over land use through private agreements with developers. The Public Trust Doctrine requires

19 that public agencies responsible for the management of public trust resources such as the fish, wildlife

20 and public recreational uses of San Pablo Bay take the public trust into account and protect public trust

21 uses whenever feasible, based on a fair and fully informed balancing of the impacts of alternative uses on

22 public trust resources.

23 2. The Project entails the adoption of a General Plan Amendment, Zoning Amendment to a

24 Planned Area ("PA") District, Design Guidelines, Master Planned Area Plan, Historic Conservation

25 Plan, Vesting Tentative Map, Conditional Use Permit, Major Design Review (of the Project's Design
26 Guidelines), Development Agreement for a 276-acre mixed-use development project with residential,

27 commercial (including retail and restaurant), cultural, civic, transportation, recreation and other uses, and

28 Disposition and Development Agreement (DDA") providing for the sale of a portion of the Project site

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 2 -

1 to the applicant Winehaven Legacy LLC, certification of a Subsequent Environmental Impact Report

2 ("SEIR"), and approval of a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Plan ("MMRP"), Statement of

3 Overriding Considerations ("SOC") and related Findings (collectively, the Project Approvals).

4 3. The Project Approvals allow real party in interest Winehaven Legacy LLC to develop

5 approximately 1,452 residential units, 374,572 square feet of rehabilitated existing structures and

6 250,000 square feet of new construction for mixed-use development that would include retail,

7 commercial, restaurant and/or residential uses, 10,000 square feet for an onsite joint fire- and police-

8 substation and/or other community service uses, a terminal on the existing pier for water transit, new

9 roads to serve the development within the Project site, widening of the existing Stenmark Drive from the

10 Project site to the I-580 access ramps, and utilities and infrastructure improvements for this

11 development. However, the Project Approvals were issued without compliance with state and municipal

12 laws protecting the environment in the following respects, among others:

13 4. The City's review of the Project was deficient under CEQA for at least the following 10

14 reasons:

15 (1) The SEIR improperly assumes that the City is obliged to develop the site for residential or
16 commercial uses, rather conserve it for public park and recreational use.

17 (2) The SEIR erroneously restricts public review and comment, and the City's ultimate

18 consideration of the Project, to time frame and to a restricted range of alternatives imposed by a

19 settlement agreement that unlawfully divests the City of police powers and land use discretion reserved

20 to the City by the California Constitution and the PZL.

21 (3) The SEIR uses an improper baseline the prior casino/resort project studied in a prior EIR

22 but never approved and not currently entitled - delimiting the scope of its environmental review rather

23 than the existing conditions at the time the Notice of Preparation of the Draft SEIR was issued.

24 (4) The SEIR fails to address the Project's inconsistency with existing local and regional land

25 use plans, including the City's General Plan and the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control

26 Board's (Regional Water Board's) Basin Plan.

27 (5) The SEIR fails to adequately identify and address the Project's significant impacts on the
28 environment, including impacts on fish and wildlife and their habitat, wildfire safety, transportation

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT .3.

impacts including vehicle miles traveled, air pollution, water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and

2 resulting global warming and.associated sea level rise, aesthetic impacts, cultural resource impacts, and

3 urban infrastructural demands including for schools, police, fire and other emergency services, public

4 recreation and public transportation.
(6) The SEIR fails to identify and assure notice to and the participation of, and the City failed to

6 conduct required consultation with, all responsible and trustee agencies including without limitation the

7 San Francisco Bay Regional Quality Control Board, the San Francisco Bay Area Air Quality

8 Management District, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, the U.S. Army Corps of

0 Engineers, the United States Coast Guard, and the National Marine Fisheries Service.

10 (T) The SEIR incorrectly characterizes some of the Project's admitted significant impacts as
11 I "unavoidable" when in fact, they could be reduced to insignificance through adoption of feasible

12 alternatives and mitigation measures, and dismisses as insignificant other impacts that are significant.

13 (8) The SEIR fails to examine a reasonable range of feasible alternatives that would reduce the

14 Project's impacts to insignificance.

15 (9) The SEIR improperly defers the identification and evaluation of mitigation measures on

16 which it relies to reduce the Project's impacts, and fails to require the development of appropriate

17 performance measures by which to evaluate the efficacy and impacts of those measures.

18 (10) The City's proposed Statement of Overriding Considerations is contrary to law and not

19 supported by the facts in the record.

20 5. The City's review and approval of the Project was contrary to the PZL in at least the

21 following four significant respects:

22 (1) The City improperly assumes that the City is obliged to develop the site for residential or

23 commercial uses, rather conserve it for public park and recreational use.

24 (2) The City erroneously restricts public review and comment, and the City's ultimate

25 consideration of the Project, to a time frame and to a restricted range of alternatives imposed by a

26 settlement agreement that unlawfully divests the City of police powers and land use discretion reserved

27 to the City by the California Constitution and the PZL.

28 (3) The City uses an improper baseline - the prior casino/resort project studied in a prior EIR but

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT

1 never approved and not currently entitled - delimiting the scope of its land use regulation rather than the

2 existing conditions at the time the City commenced its review of the Project.

3 (4) The Project is inconsistent with existing local and regional land use plans, including the City

4 of Richmond General Plan 2030 including Land Use Goal LU-1 and Policy LU 1.1, which require that

5 urban growth be directed to higher-density, transit-oriented, infill development that utilizes existing

6 vacant parcels in the urban core areas and makes use of existing public transportation and other

7 infrastructure including schools, police, fire and other emergency services, and thereby reduces the

8 environmental costs including energy, transportation and global warming impacts of that growth. The

0 Project violates Land Use Goal LU-2 and Policy LU 2.1 by creating a severe fire hazard and restricting

10 residential development to highly expensive and thus exclusionary housing, instead of providing a safe

11 place for people of all ages, ethnicities and abilities to live, work and play, and revitalizing the

12 downtown and Civic Center areas of the City. By placing development far beyond the existing reach of

13 the City's public infrastructure, the Project also violates Land Use Policy LU 2.4, which directs the City

14 to promote the equitable distribution of community facilities and infrastructure, and locate community
15 facilities near residents in order to make use of existing public infrastructure and to serve underserved

16 communities. The Project violates Land Use Goal LU 4 and Land Use Policy LU 4.2 because it does not
17 "preserve open space areas along the shoreline, creeks, and in the hills to protect natural habitat," and
18 instead degrades an extraordinary regional park and cultural resource for private gain. The Project
19 violates Land Use Policy LU 5.2 because it is inconsistent with the City's duty to "support development

20 on the San Pablo Peninsula [the location of the Project] as a regional recreation destination" among other

21 compatible uses. The Project also violates Land Use Goal LU 6 because it creates an unsustainable
22 development that is not "near transit and in areas with existing transportation infrastructure," and will

23 needlessly harm the natural world and the public fisc.

24 6. The Project violates the Public Trust Doctrine because it degrades public trust resources for

25 non-public trust uses. For example, in issuing the Project Approvals, the City failed to recognize that the

26 Project will displace and eliminate critical eelgrass habitat, a public trust resource essential to herring

27 reproduction that also provides nursery habitat for fishes and crustaceans. The City failed to address the

28 fact that global warming will cause sea level rise and corresponding upslope migration of the adjacent

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 5 -

-

2 shoreline of San Pablo Bay and its existing shallow water eelgrass habitat during the Project's projected

3 lifespan. The Project will prevent upslope migration of eelgrass that is essential to the survival of this

4 critical marine vegetation and the species including fishes and crustaceans that depend on it.

7.

5 Conservation Groups bring this action in order to vindicate the public's statutory and

6 constitutional right to a fair, open and well-informed approval process including the City's compliance

7 with CEQA's command that agencies carefully examine the environmental impacts of their projects

8 before approving them and the PZL's mandate that the City comply with its General Plan and

9 implementing land use ordinances. Contrary to these requirements, the City approved the Project

10 without conducting adequate CEQA review, complying with its land use laws, exercising its independent

11 land use discretion unfettered by purported land use restrictions imposed by private development

12 agreements, and recognizing and implementing the Public Trust Doctrine. Conservation Groups ask this

13 Court to order the City to rescind its unlawful Project Approvals, and to direct the City to comply with

14 CEQA and the City's land use procedures and standards as required by law before taking any further
action on the Project. b

15 JURISDICTION

16 8.

17 This Verified Petition and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief is authorized by
Code of Civil Procedure sections 525 et seq., 1060 et seq. and 1085 et

18 sections 21168 and 21168.5. seq-, and Public Resources Code

19 9. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 388 and Public Resources Code section
20 21167.7, Conservation Groups served the California Attorney General with a copy of this Verified

21

22 Petition concurrently with the filing of this action, and consistent with Public Resources Code section

23 21167.5, Conservation Groups served the City with notice of this suit.

PARTIES

24 10. Petitioner NORTH COAST RIVERS ALLIANCE ("North Coast Rivers") is a non-profit
25 unincorporated association with members throughout Northern California. North Coast Rivers was

26

27 formed for the purpose of protecting California's waterways, including the San Francisco Bay-Delta, and
their watersheds from the adverse effects of excessive water diversions, ill-planned urban development,
28 harmful resource extraction, pollution, and other forms of environmental degradation. Its members use

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 6 -

1 and enjoy California's waterways and watersheds for fishing, boating, swimming, aesthetic enjoyment,

2 bird watching, scientific study, and related non-consumptive uses. The interests of North Coast Rivers

3 and its members have been, are being, and unless the relief requested herein is granted, will be adversely

4 affected and injured by the City's adoption of the Project Approvals.

5 11. Petitioner PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS

6 ("PCFFA") is a nonprofit membership organization incorporated in 1976 with headquarters located in

7 San Francisco, California. PCFFA is composed of more than 14 separate commercial fishing and vessel

8 owners' associations situated along the West Coast of the United States. By virtue of its combined

9 membership of approximately 750 fishermen and women, PCFFA is the single largest commercial
10 fishing advocacy organization on the West Coast. PCFFA represents the majority of California's

11 organized commercial salmon fishermen and has been an active advocate for the protection of Pacific

12 salmon and their spawning, rearing and migratory habitat for more than 30 years. PCFFA and its

13 members would be harmed by the proposed Project because it would threaten their use and enjoyment of

14 San Pablo Bay and its fisheries, which depend on sustainable management of habitat for wild California

15 King salmon, Pacific herring, Dungeness crab and other public trust resources of the San Francisco Bay-

16 Delta and its associated ecosystems.

17 12. Petitioner INSTITUTE FOR FISHERIES RESOURCES ("IFR") is non-profit, tax-exempt
18 organization that works to protect and restore commercial fish populations and the communities that

19 depend on them. IFR maintains its principal place of business in San Francisco, California. IFR both

20 funds and manages many fish habitat protection programs and initiatives. In that capacity, IFR seeks

21 reforms to protect fish health and habitat throughout the West Coast of the United States and has
22 successfully advocated for dam removals, improved pesticide controls, better forestry stream protection

23 standards, and enhanced marine and watershed conservation regulations throughout the West Coast. IFR
24 | has worked tirelessly for years to restore and enhance the Delta and its beleaguered fish and wildlife.

25 IFR and its members will be directly and indirectly injured by the City's Project Approvals and its failure

26 to adequately protect the imperiled fisheries of the San Francisco Bay-Delta.

27 13. Petitioner SAN FRANCISCO CRAB BOAT OWNERS ASSOCIATION ("San Francisco

28 Fishermen") is a century-old association of owners and operators of small, family-owned fishing boats

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 7 -

1 that catch Dungeness crab, wild California King salmon, Pacific herring, and other species that live in

2 and depend upon the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean, the San Francisco Bay-Delta, and the Sacramento

3 and San Joaquin Rivers and their tributaries. San Francisco Fishermen is also actively involved in

4 community education and advocacy concerning fisheries resources legislation to ensure that the rich

5 heritage of commercial fishing in the Bay Area will survive for future generations. San Francisco

6 Fishermen and its members will be harmed by the City's Project Approvals because the Project threatens

7 their continued historic use and enjoyment of the fisheries and other public trust resources of the San

8 Francisco Bay-Delta and its connected ecosystems.

9 14. Respondent CITY OF RICHMOND ("City") is a chartered municipality and public agency

10 subject to the requirements of the California Constitution, CEQA, the PZL, the City's General Plan and

11 Municipal Code, and the Public Trust Doctrine in connection with its approval of the Project. Contrary

12 to and without compliance with those laws, on or about September 8 and 15, 2020 the City purported to

13 adopt the Project Approvals.

14 15. Real Party in Interest WINEHAVEN LEGACY LLC (*Winehaven") is a corporation
15 organized under the laws of Delaware that is currently qualified to do business in California, where it has

16 been registered since April 2019. Winehaven is the applicant for the Project Approvals and is financially

17 interested in the Project's construction and operation, and in the related transfer of a portion of the
18 Project site to Winehaven for development.

19 16. The true names and capacities of respondents DOES 1-100, inclusive, are unknown to

20 Conservation Groups who therefore sue such respondents by such fictitious names pursuant to Code of

21 Civil Procedure section 474. Conservation Groups will, with leave of court if necessary, further amend

22 this Verified Petition when the true names and capacities of said DOE respondents have been

23 ascertained.

24 17. Conservation Groups are unaware of the true names and capacities of real parties in interest

25 sued herein as DOES 101-200, and sue such real parties in interest herein by fictitious names.

26 Petitioners are informed and believe, and based on such information and belief allege, that the

27 fictitiously named real parties in a interest have a financial or other beneficial interest in the City's

28 approval of the Project. When the true identities and capacities of these real parties in interest have been

such identities and capacities.

3 LEGAL BACKGROUND

4 CEQA

6 18. CEQA is California's primary statutory mandate for environmental protection. It applies to

7 all state and local agencies, and requires them to "first identify the [significant] environmental effects of

8 projects, and then to mitigate those adverse effects through the imposition of feasible mitigation

9 measures or through the selection of feasible alternatives." (Sierra Club v. State Board of Forestry

10 (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1215, 1233.) Its most important substantive imperative requires "public agencies to

11 deny approval of a project with significant adverse effects when feasible alternatives or feasible

12 mitigation measures can substantially lessen such effects." (Sierra Club v. Gilroy City Council (1990)
222 Cal.App.3d 30, 41.)

13

14 19. CEQA's mandate for detailed environmental review "ensures that members of the

15 [governmental decision-making body] will fully consider the information necessary to render decisions

16 that intelligently take into account the environmental consequences" of their proposed action. (Mountain

17 Lion Foundation v. Fish and Game Commission (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 133; Public Resources Code

18 §§ 21080.5(d)(2)(D), 21091(d)(2); 14 C.C.R. [CEQA Guidelines] ("Guidelines") § 15088.) The CEQA

19 process thus "protects not only the environment but also informed self-government." (Citizens of Goleta

20 Valley v. Board of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.)

21 20. A1l California "public agencies" must comply with CEQA when they approve discretionary

22 projects. (Public Resources Code § 21080(a).) The City is both a "public agency" and a "local agency"

23 as those terms are defined in CEQA. (Public Resources Code §§ 21062, 21063.) Therefore the City is
subject to CEQA. (Id.)

24

25 21. A proposed governmental action requires environmental review under CEQA if (1) the

26 agency is contemplating an "approval" of an action as defined by Guidelines section 15352, (2) the

27 subject matter of the contemplated approval constitutes a "project" under Public Resources Code section
21065 and Guidelines section 15378(a), and (3) the project to be approved does not fall within a
28 statutory exemption created by the Legislature under Public Resources Code section 21080(b) and

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 9 -

1 recognized under CEQA Guidelines sections 15260-15285, or a categorical exemption in the Guidelines

2 as promulgated by the California Resources Agency pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21084(a)

3 and Guidelines sections 15061(b)(2), 15300-15333 and 15354.

4 22. If a local agency such as the City is considering approval of a project that is subject to

5 CEQA, then it must prepare an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") if the project "may have a

6 significant effect on the environment." (Public Resources Code § 21151(a).) If there is substantial

7 evidence that one or more significant environmental impacts may occur, and the project proponent is

8 either unwilling or unable to mitigate them to insignificance, then the lead agency must prepare an EIR

9 analyzing those effects and suggesting feasible means, if any, of mitigating or avoiding them including

10 alternatives that would achieve most of the basic objectives of the project without causing significant

11 environmental effects. (Public Resources Code §§ 21002, 21002.1, 21061; Guidelines §§ 15080-15096,

12 15120-15132, 15160-15170.)

13 23. In applying these CEQA procedures, an agency may not segment a project to avoid

14 preparing an EIR on the entirety, or whole, of the project. (Guidelines § 15378(a), (c), (d).) CEQA's

15 "requirements cannot be avoided by chopping up proposed projects into bite-size pieces which,

16 individually considered, might be found to have no significant effect on the environment or to be only
17 ministerial." (Plan for Arcadia, Inc. V. City Council of Arcadia (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 712, 726.)

18 24. The final step in the CEQA process is public notice of any CEQA approval. A public

19 agency must provide adequate notice when it "approves or determines to carry out a project that is

20 subject to [CEQA]." (Public Resources Code § 21108; Guidelines § 15062(c)(1); County of Amador v.

21 El Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 962-965.) A local agency files a notice of

22 determination ("NOD") to confirm its approval of a project that is subject to CEQA. (Guidelines

23 15075(d).)

24 25. On or about September 16, 2020, the City filed an NOD of its Project Approvals with the

25 Contra Costa County Clerk, which posted notice of the City's approval of the Project on September 17,
26 2020. That posting triggered a 30-day limitations period for the filing of a lawsuit challenging the City's
27 Project Approvals under CEQA. (Public Resources Code § 21167, subdivs. (b), (c) and (e).)

28 I/

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 10 -

1 PLANNING AND ZONING LAW

2 26. California's Planning and Zoning Law ("PZL") is set forth in Government Code sections

3 65000 et seq. It governs land use planning, zoning and related development permit processes in counties

4 and general law cities, and also in charter cities such as the City of Richmond with respect to matters of

5 statewide concern and as provided by law. It requires local governments to adopt comprehensive general

6 plans, and requires that land use planning decisions be consistent with them. (Government Code section

7 65300 et seq.) Thus, Government Code section 65300 directs that "chartered cities shall adopt general

8 plans which contain the mandatory elements specified in Section 65302," and Government Code section

9 65700, subd. (b) requires that most land use approvals by charter cities must be consistent with

10 applicable specific plans, which must, in turn be consistent with the city general plan. Govemnment Code

11 section 65302 directs that each general plan shall include a land use element, circulation element,

12 housing element, conservation element, open space element, noise element, safety element, and

13 environmental justice element. Each plan must be internally consistent, and zoning and subordinate land

14 use decisions and permits must be consistent with the general plan. (Government Code sections

15 65300.5, 65454, 65455 and 65770, subd. (b).)

16 27. Because the "general plan is atop the hierarchy of local government law regulating land

17 use," local governments such as the City must "proceed[] in the manner required by" their general plan.
18 (Neighborhood Action Group v. County of Calaveras (1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 1176, 1183 (first quote);

19 C.C.P. § 1094.5(b) (second quote).) The requirement that all approvals allowing land use, including the

20 City's adoption of the Project Approvals challenged in this action, must be consistent with the general

21 plan

22 is necessarily to be implied from the hierarchical relationship of the land use laws. To

23 view them in order: a use permit is struck from the mold of the zoning law ([Government Code section] 65901); the zoning law must comply with the adopted general plan (§
24 65860); the adopted general plan must conform with state law ($§ 65300, 65302). The validity of the permit process derives from compliance with this hierarchy of planning

25 laws. These laws delimit the authority of the permit issuing agency to act and establish the measure of a valid permit . A permit action taken without compliance with the

26 land use laws IS ultravires as to any defect implicated by the uses sought by the permit.

27 (Neighborhood Action Group, supra, 156 Cal.App.3d at 1184 (emphasis added).)

28 28. Although Government Code section 65700, subd. (a) exempts charter cities from chapter 3

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 11 -

- of the Planning and Zoning Law (commencing with section 65100), Govemment Code section 65700,

2 subd. (b) provides that the following sections of the Government Code "shall be applicable to charter

3 cities:" 65300.5 (requiring that general plans shall be internally consistent), 65301.5 (providing that the

4 adoption of a general plan or an amendment to a general plan sball be reviewable under section 1085 of

5 the Code of Civil Procedure), 65359 (requiring that specific plans and other local plans shall be

6 consistent with general plan amendments), 65450 (requiring that the local legislative body "shall[]
7 prepare specific plans for the systematic implementation of the general plan"), 65454 (requiring that

8 specific plans shall be "consistent with the general plan"), 65455 (requiring that local public works

9 pröjects, tentative and parcel subdivision maps, and zoning ordinances and amendments thereto shall be
10 "consistent with the adopted specific plan"), 65460.8 (requiring that transit village plans and

11 amendments thereto shall be "consistent with the general plan"), 65590 (requiring that local govemments

12 comply with certain laws applicable to low- and moderate-income housing within the coastal zone) and

13 65590.1 (requiring expedited review of housing applications with the coastal zone) and Article10.6
14 (commencing with section 65580) (encouraging the availability of housing). Id.

15 29. In accordance with the PZL, the City has adopted its General Plan 2030 ("General Plan"). It
16| contains several provisions that establish goals, policies and programs to protect public health and safety

17 and environmental resources that are particularly applicable to the Project, including, among others, the

18 following:

19 (1) Land Use Goal LU-1 and Land Use Policy LU.1.1, which require that urban growth be
20 directed to higher-density, transit-oriented, infill development that utilizes existing vacant parcels in the

21 urban core areas and makes use of existing public transportation and other infrastructure including

22 schools, police, fire and other emergency services, and thereby reduces the environmental costs including

23 energy, transportation and global warming impacts of that growth.

24 (2) Land Use Goal LU-2 and Land Use Policy LU 2.1, which direct the City to create healthy

25 and viable neighborhoods that provide a safe place for people of all ages, ethnicities and abilities to live,
26 work and play, and revitalize the downtown and Civic Center arcas of the City.

27 (3) Land Use Policy LU 2.4, which directs the City to promote the equitable distribution of
28 community facilities and infrastructure, and locate community facilities near residents in order to make

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 12 -

1 use of existing public infrastructure and to serve underserved communities.

2 (4) Land Use Goal LU 4, which directs the City to "Ip]rotect and preserve natural resources to

3 nurture environmental and human health.*

4 (5) Land Use Policy LU 4.2, which requires the City to "preserve open space areas along the
5 shoreline, creeks, and in the hills to protect natural habitat."

6 (6) Land Use Policy LU 5.2, which requires the City to "support development on the San Pablo

7 Peninsula [the location of the Project] as a regional recreation destination" among other compatible uses.

8 (T) Land Use Goal LU 6, which directs the City to locate development "near transit and in areas

Q with existing transportation infrastructure.'

10 CHARTER CITY LAND USE DISCRETION UNDER THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION

11 30. The California Constitution, Article 11, section 5, invests charter cities, including the City

12 of Richmond, with broad authority to "make and enforce all ordinances and regulations in respect to
13 municipal affairs" subject to the State's general laws as to matters of statewide concern such as the
14 required elements of the general plan.

15 31. The City may not subvert its constitutionally-based police power by contracting away its
16 discretionary authority to control land use through private agreements with developers. (Scrutton V.

17 County of Sacramento (1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 412, 419 ("[t]he police power to zone and rezone may not

18 be restricted by contract"); Griffin v. County of Marin (1958) 157 Cal.App.2d 507, 514-515 ("the police
19 | power to zone property may not be limited by private agreement").).

20 PUBLIC TRUST DOCTRINE

21 32. Water Code section 85023 states, "the longstanding constitutional principle of reasonable

22 use and the Public Trust Doctrine shall be the foundation of state water management policy and are
23 particularly important and applicable to the Delta." San Pablo Bay, San Francisco Bay, and their

24 watersheds including the Project site, are inextricably connected to and thus part of the Delta.

25 33. In National Audubon Society v. Superior Court (1983) 33 Cal.3d 419, 426, the court noted
26 that the public trust doctrine mandates that "before state courts and agencies approve water diversions
27 they . consider the effect of such diversions upon interests protected by the public trust, and attempt,

28 so far as feasible, to avoid or minimize any harm to those interests." The National Audubon Society

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT 13 -

Court went on to explain:

2 Just as the history of this state shows that appropriation may be necessary for efficient use of water despite unavoidable harm to public trust values, it demonstrates that an appropriative
3 water rights system administered without consideration of the public trust may cause

4 unnecessary and unjustified harm to trust interests. As a matter of practical necessity the state may have to approve appropriations despite foreseeable harm to public trust uses. In so doing, however, the state must bear in mind its duty as trustee to consider the effect of the
5 taking on the public trust, and to preserve, so far as consistent with the public interest, the uses protected by the trust.
6

7 (Id., citations omitted.)

8 34. "Public trust easements are traditionally defined in terms of navigation, commerce and

O fisheries. They have been held to include the right to fish, hunt, bathe, swim, to use for boating and
10 general recreation purposes the navigable waters of the state, and to use the bottom of the navigable

11 waters for anchoring, standing, or other purposes." (Marks v. Whitney (1971) 6 Cal.3d 251, 259.) For

12 nearly 50 years it has been settled law in California that public trust values also "encompass[] . . . the

13 preservation of those lands in their natural state, so that they may serve as ecological units for scientific

14 study, as open space, and as environments which provide food and habitat for birds and marine life, and

15 which favorably affect the scenery and climate of the area." (Id., at 259-260.)

16 35. Although compliance with CEQA "may assist an agency in complying with its duties under

17 the public trust doctrine . . . . [,] CEQA review of a project does not necessarily or automatically satisfy

18 the agency's affirmative duties to take the trust into account and protect public trust uses whenever
19 feasible." (San Francisco Baykeeper, Inc: v. State Lands Com. (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 562, 571.) "[A]

20 public trust use is not any use that may confer a public benefit, but rather a use that facilitates public
21 access, public enjoyment, or public use of trust land." (Id. at 570.)

22 36. The Project Approvals impact the public trust resources and uses of San Pablo Bay and San

23 Francisco Bay by discharging pollutants into these public waters, allowing increased use of these waters
24 for commercial and other waterborne uses, displacing existing and future upslope shallow water habitat
25 needed by eelgrass to survive global warming and its associated sea level rise, and thereby impacting the
26 fishes, crustaceans, and other flora and fauna that need eelgrass habitat for their health and survival.

I VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 14 -

:

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

2 37. Conservation Groups' members use and enjoy the fish and wildlife and other public trust

3 resources of San Pablo Bay, the San Francisco Bay and Delta of which it is an integral part, and their

4 tributary streams and watersheds including the Project site. For this reason they are vitally interested in

5 the City's informed and lawful management of the Project site in accordance with applicable laws and

6 land use plans including the City's General Plan.

7 38. Conservation Groups and their members submitted comments to the City urging its

8 compliance with these laws and plans before approving the Project.

9 39. The City did not review and approve the Project in accordance with applicable

10 environmental laws. Instead, the City approved the Project without: (1) conducting adequate CEQA

11 review, (2) complying with its land use laws and plans, (3) exercising its independent land use discretion

12 unfettered by purported land use restrictions imposed by private development agreements, and (4)

13 recognizing and implementing the Public Trust Doctrine, all as further delineated in this Verified

14 Petition and Complaint.

15 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

16 (Writ of Mandate, Declaratory and Injunctive Relief

17 to Set Aside Project Approval as Contrary to CEQA)

18 (Alleged by Petitioners Against All Respondents and Real Parties)

19 40. The paragraphs set forth above are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

20 41. Conservation Groups bring this First Cause of Action pursuant to Public Resources Code

21 sections 21168 and/or 21168.5, on the grounds that the City failed to proceed in accordance with law,

22 and committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, in that it considered and adopted the Project Approvals

23 without undertaking an adequate analysis of their potential environmental impacts and alternatives and

24 mitigation measures that would avoid or reduce those impacts as required by CEQA.

25 42. The City is a "public agency" and a "local agency" within the meaning of CEQA. (Public
26 Resources Code §§ 21062, 21063; Guidelines §§ 15368, 15379.) CEQA requires public agencies to
27 conduct environmental review prior to approving any discretionary project that may have a significant
28 impact on the environment. (Public Resources Code §§ 21080(a), 21151; Guidelines § 15004(a).) The

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 15 -

1 City's adoption of the Project Approvals is discretionary project subject to CEQA. (Guidelines §

2 15357.)

3 43. Under CEQA, the term "project" means the "whole of an action, which has a potential for

4 resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect

5 physical change in the environment." (Guidelines § 15378(a).) The term "project" refers to the "activity

6 which is being approved and which may be subject to several discretionary approvals by government
agencies" and not the governmental approvals themselves. (Id. § 15378(c).) The Project Approvals
8 constitute a "project" under CEQA and accordingly, they are subject to CEQA and its requirement that

9 the City's environmental analysis adequate address the "whole" of the Project and its impacts.

10 44. "Approval" of a project, for purposes of CEQA, means a decision by the agency "which

11 commits the agency to a definite course of action in regard to a project intended to be carried out by any

12 person." (Id. § 15352(a).) The City's consideration and adoption of the Project Approvals constitutes

13 the "approval of a project" under CEQA.

14 45. If there is any possibility that a discretionary project being approved by a public agency may
15 cause a significant effect on the environment, directly or indirectly, the agency's review of the project
16 must comply with CEQA. (Public Resources Code § § 21065, 21080(a), 21151.) The Project Approvals

17 will result in a number of "reasonably foresecable indirect physical change[s] in the environment" as

18 well as direct physical changes in the environment, and therefore the City's review must comply with

19 CEQA.

20 46. On October 9, 2020, Conservation Groups faxed and mailed notice, including a copy of

21 their Verified Petition and Complaint, to the City in accordance with Public Resources Code section
22 21167.5, informing it of Conservation Groups' intention to file this action immediately. Concurrently

23 with the filing of their Verified Petition and Complaint, Conservation Groups provided notice, including

24 a copy of their Verified Petition and Complaint, of the pendency of this proceeding to the California

25 Attorney General as required by Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure

26 section 388.

27 47. The SEIR improperly assumes that the City is obliged to develop the site for residential or
28 commercial uses, rather conserve it for public park and recreational use.

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 16 -

1 48. The SEIR erroneously restricts public review and comment, and the City's ultimate

2 consideration of the Project, to a time frame and to a restricted range of alternatives imposed by a

3 settlement agreement that unlawfully divests the City of police powers and land use discretion reserved

4 to the City by the California Constitution and the PZL.

5 49. The SEIR uses an improper baseline - the prior casino/resort project studied in a prior EIR

6 but never approved and not currently entitled - delimiting the - scope of its environmental review rather

7 than the existing conditions at the time the Notice of Preparation of the Draft SEIR was issued.

8 50. The SEIR fails to address the Project's inconsistency with existing local and regional land

9 use plans, including the City's General Plan and the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control

10 Board's Basin Plan.

11 51. The SEIR fails to adequately identify and address the Project's significant impacts on the
12 environment, including impacts on fish and wildlife and their habitat, wildfire safety, transportation

13 impacts including vehicle miles traveled, air pollution, water pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and
14 resulting global warming and associated sea level rise, aesthetic impacts, cultural resource impacts, and

15 urban infrastructural demands including for schools, police, fire and other emergency services, public
16 recreation and public transportation.

17 52. The SEIR fails to identify and assure notice to and the participation of, and the City failed to
18. conduct required consultation with, all responsible and trustee agencies including without limitation the
19 Regional Water Board, the San Francisco Bay Area Air Quality Management District, the California
20 Department of Fish and Wildlife, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Coast Guard, and

21 the National Marine Fisheries Service.

22 53. The SEIR incorrectly characterizes some of the Project's admitted significant impacts as

23 "unavoidable" when in fact, they could be reduced to insignificance through adoption of feasible

24 alternatives and mitigation measures, and dismisses as insignificant other impacts that are significant.

25 54. The SEIR fails to examine reasonable range of feasible alternatives that would reduce the
26 Project's impacts to insignificance.

27 55. The SEIR improperly defers the identification and evaluation of mitigation measures on

28 which it relies to reduce the Project's impacts, and fails to require the development of appropriate

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 17 -

1 performance measures by which to evaluate the efficacy and impacts of those measures.

2 56. The City's proposed Statement of Overriding Considerations is contrary to law and not

3 supported by the facts in the record.

4 57. For each of the foregoing reasons, the SEIR is inadequate, and the Project Approvals violate

5 CEQA and must be declared invalid and set aside.

6 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

7 Writ of Mandate, Declaratory and Injunctive Relief to Set Aside

8 Project Approvals as Contrary to Planning and Zoning Law)
9 (Alleged by Petitioners Against All Respondents and Real Parties)

10 58. The paragraphs set forth above are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

11 59. Government Code sections 65000, et seq. prescribe certain fundamental procedures and
12 substantive standards that charter cities such as the City of Richmond must follow in adopting a
13 comprehensive, long-term general plan for the use and physical development of land within the City, and

14 in developing goals, policies and programs, including specific plans, to implement that plan. As

15 summarized above and below, most local land use approvals must be consistent with the general plan of

16 a charter city such as the City of Richmond. The general plan is, in short, a "constitution" for all further

17 development with the City. (O'Loane v. O'Rourke (1965) 231 Cal.App.2d 774, 782.)

18 60. Although Government Code section 65700, subd. (a) exempts charter cities from chapter 3

19 of the Planning and Zoning Law (commencing with section 65100), Government Code section 65700,
20 subd. (b) provides that the following sections of the Government Code "shall be applicable to charter

21 cities:» 65300.5 (requiring that general plans shall be internally consistent), 65301.5 (providing that the

22 adoption of a general plan or an amendment to a general plan shall be reviewable under section 1085 of

23 the Code of Civil Procedure), 65359 (requiring that specific plans and other local plans shall be
24 consistent with general plan amendments), 65450 (requiring that the local legislative body "shall[]
25 prepare specific plans for the systematic implementation of the general plan"), 65454 (requiring that
26 specific plans shall be "consistent with the general plan"), 65455 (requiring that local public works

27 projects, tentative and parcel subdivision maps, and zoning ordinances and amendments thereto shall be

28 "consistent with the adopted specific plan"), 65460.8 (requiring that transit village plans and

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 18 -

1 amendments thereto shall be "consistent with the general plan"), 65590 (requiring that local governments

2 comply with certain laws applicable to low- and moderate-income housing within the coastal zone) and

3 65590.1 (requiring expedited review of housing applications within the coastal zone) and Article10.6

4 (commencing with section 65580) (encouraging the availability of housing). Id.

5 61. Because the Project Approvals must be consistent with applicable specific plans under

6 Government Code sections 65700, subd. (b) and 65455 as summarized above, and the City's specific

7 plans must in turn be consistent with the City's General Plan under Government Code sections 65700,

8 subd. (b), 65450 and 65454 as likewise summarized above, the Project Approvals must, in turn, be

9 consistent with the General Plan.

10 62. Government Code section 65300 directs that chartered cities shall adopt general plans

11 which contain the mandatory elements specified in Section 65302.

12 63. Government Code section 65302 directs that the general plan "shall consist of a statement

13 of development policies and shall include a diagram or diagrams and text setting forth objectives,
14 principles, standards and plan proposals." (Id.) It must include elements for land use, circulation,
15 housing, conservation, open space, noise, safety, environmental justice and additional elements as

16 needed to regulate land use and protect and preserve environmental resources. (Id.)

17 64. Government Code section 65030.1 directs that it is state policy that "decisions involving the
18 future growth of the state, most of which are made and will continue to be made at the local level, should

19 be guided by an effective planning process, including the local general plan . . . ." (Id.)

20 65. Government Code section 65564 directs that "[e]very local open-space plan shall contain an
21 action program consisting of specific programs which the legislative body intends to pursue in
22 implementing its open-space plan." (Id.) As noted above, charter cities must include an open space plan

23 or element in their general plan.

24 66. Government Code section 65566 directs that "[a]ny action by a county or city by which

25 open-space land or any interest therein is acquired or disposed of or its use restricted or regulated,

26 whether or not pursuant to this part, must be consistent with the local open-space plan." (Id.)
27 67. Contrary to the PZL, the City of Richmond General Plan, and the City's Municipal Code,

28 the City adopted the Project Approvals without complying with the substantive and procedural

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 19 -

1 requirements of these planning laws and City General Plan and Municipal Code in the following

2 respects, among others.

3 68. The City improperly assumed that the City is obliged to develop the site for residential or

4 commercial uses, rather conserve it for public park and recreational use.

5 69. The City erroneously restricted public review and comment, and the City's ultimate
6 consideration of the Project, to a time frame and to a restricted range of alternatives imposed by a

7 settlement agreement that unlawfully divests the City of police powers and land use discretion reserved

8 to the City by the California Constitution and the PZL.
70. The City used an improper baseline - the prior casino/resort project studied in a prior EIR

10 but never approved and not currently entitled - to delimit the scope of its land use regulatory authority

11 rather than the existing conditions at the time the City commenced its review of the Project.

12 71. The Project is inconsistent with existing local and regional land use plans, including the

13 following provisions of the City of Richmond General Plan 2030, among others:

14 (1) Land Use Goal LU-1 and Land Use Policy LU 1.1, which require that urban growth be

15 directed to higher-density, transit-oriented, infill development that utilizes existing vacant parcels in the

16 urban core areas and makes use of existing public transportation and other infrastructure including

17 schools, police, fire and other emergency services, and thereby reduces the environmental costs including

18 energy, transportation and global warming impacts of that growth.

19 (2) Land Use Goal LU-2 and Land Use Policy LU 2.1, which direct the City to create healthy

20 and viable neighborhoods that provide a safe place for people of all ages, ethnicities and abilities to live,

21 work and play, and revitalize the downtown and Civic Center areas of the City.

22 (3) Land Use Policy LU 2.4, which directs the City to promote the equitable distribution of

23 community facilities and infrastructure, and locate community facilities near residents in order to make

24 use of existing public infrastructure and to serve underserved communities.

25 (4) Land Use Goal LU 4, which directs the City to "[p]rotect and preserve natural resources to
26  nurture environmental and human health."

27 (5) Land Use Policy LU 4.2, which requires the City to "preserve open space areas along the

28 shoreline, creeks, and in the hills to protect natural habitat.3

72.

6

7 The City proceeded in excess of its jurisdiction and abused its discretion when it adopted

8 the Project Approvals because it failed to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of
the PZL, City of Richmond General Plan, and the City Municipal Code. The City's adoption of the

Q Project Approvals is therefore invalid and must be set aside.

2 (Violation of the Public Trust Doctrine)

3 (Alleged by All Petitioners Against All Respondents)

4 77. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by

5 reference.

6 78. Water Code section 85023 states, "the longstanding constitutional principle of reasonable

7 use and the Public Trust Doctrine shall be the foundation of state water management policy and are
8 particularly important and applicable to the Delta." San Pablo Bay, San Francisco Bay, and their

9 watersheds including the Project site, are inextricably connected to and thus part of the Delta.

10 79. In National Audubon Society v. Superior Court, supra, 33 Cal.3d at 426, the court noted that

11 the public trust doctrine mandates that "before state courts and agencies approve water diversions they

12 consider the effect of such diversions upon interests protected by the public trust, and attempt, so far

13 as feasible, to avoid or minimize any harm to those interests." The National Audubon Society Court

14 went on to explain:

15 Just as the history of this state shows that appropriation may be necessary for efficient use of

16 water despite unavoidable harm to public trust values, it demonstrates that an appropriative water rights system administered without consideration of the public trust may cause unnecessary and unjustified harm to trust interests. As a matter of practical necessity the state
17 may have to approve appropriations despite foreseeable harm to public trust uses. In so

18 doing, however, the state must bear in mind its duty as trustee to consider the effect of the taking on the public trust, and to preserve, so far as consistent with the public interest, the uses protected by the trust.

22 fisheries. They have been held to include the right to fish, hunt, bathe, swim, to use for boating and
23 general recreation purposes the navigable waters of the state, and to use the bottom of the navigable
24 waters for anchoring, standing, or other purpöses." (Marks v. Whitney, supra, 6 Cal.3d at 259.) For
25 nearly 50 years it has been settled law in California that public trust values also "encompass[] . . . the

26 preservation of those lands in their natural state, SO that they may serve as ecological units for scientific
27 study, as open space, and as environments which provide food and habitat for birds and marine life, and
28 which favorably affect the scenery and climate of the area." (Id., at 259-260.)

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 22 -

1 81. Although compliance with CEQA "may assist an agency in complying with its duties under

2 the public trust doctrine . . . .L.] CEQA review of a project does not necessarily or automatically satisfy

3 the agency's affirmative duties to take the trust into account and protect public trust uses whenever

4 feasible." (San Francisco Baykeeper, Inc. V. State Lands Com., supra, 29 Cal.App.5th at 571.) "[A]

5 public trust use is not any use that may confer a public benefit, but rather a use that facilitates public

6 access, public enjoyment, or public use of trust land." (Id. at 570.)

7 82. The Project Approvals impact the public trust resources and uses of San Pablo Bay and San
8 Francisco Bay by discharging pollutants into these public waters, allowing increased use of these waters

9 for commercial and other waterborne uses, displacing existing and future upslope shallow water habitat

10 needed by eelgrass to survive global warming and its associated sea level rise, and thereby impacting the

11 fishes, crustaceans, and other flora and fauna that need eelgrass habitat for their health and survival.

12 83. Contrary to the evidence, the City premised is Project Approvals on the erroneous

13 assumption that with its stated mitigations, the Project a would not have a significant impact on eelgrass

14 and other public trust resources. In fact, the Project will adversely affect numerous public trust
15| resources, including habitat necessary for fish, wildlife, and recreation that will be impacted due to the
16 Project's construction and operation, as well as from potentially contaminated discharges to San Pablo

17 Bay from the Project site.

18 84. For example, in issuing the Project Approvals, the City failed to recognize that the Project

19 will displace and eliminate both existing and future critical eelgrass habitat, a public trust resource

20 essential to herring reproduction that also provides nursery habitat for fishes and crustaceans. The City
21 failed to address the fact that global warming will cause sea level rise and corresponding upslope

22 migration of the adjacent shoreline of San Pablo Bay and its existing shallow water eelgrass habitat
23 during the Project's projected lifespan. The Project's shoreline and near-shoreline development will
24 prevent upslope migration of eelgrass that is essential to the survival of this critical marine vegetation
25 and the species including fishes and crustaceans that depend on it.

26 85. The City also premised its Project Approvals on the erroneous assumption that its CEQA

27 review satisfied its responsibilities under the Public Trust Doctrine. Although compliance with CEQA
28 "may assist an agency in complying with its duties under the public trust doctrine . . . . L,] CEQA review

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 23 -

1 of a project does not necessarily or automatically satisfy the agency's affirmative duties to take the trust

2 into account and protect public trust uses whenever feasible." (San Francisco Baykeeper, Inc. V. State

3 Lands Com., supra, 29 Cal.App.5th at 571.) Yet the City relied upon its CEQA analysis to satisfy its

4 public trust management obligations.

5 86. Because the City assumed its CEQA review satisfied its responsibilities under the Public

6 Trust Doctrine, it failed to study a reasonable range of alternatives that would address and reduce or

7 avoid, the Project's impacts on public trust resources.

87. By adopting the Project Approvals despite the fact that feasible alternatives and mitigation

9 measures may exist that would preserve public trust resources to a greater extent than the Project, the

10 City abdicated its affirmative statutory and constitutional "duties to take the trust into account and

11 protect public trust uses whenever feasible," based on a fair and fully informed balancing of the impacts

12 of these alternatives on public trust resources. (San Francisco Baykeeper, Inc. V. State Lands Com.,

13 supra, 29 Cal.App.5th at 571.)

14 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

15 (Writ of Maudate, Declaratory and Injunctive Relief to Set Aside

16 Project Approvals as Contrary to C.C.P. §§ 1085 and 1094.5)

17 (Alleged by Petitioners Against all Respondents and Real Parties)

18 88. The paragraphs set forth above are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

19 89. The City proceeded in excess of its authority and abused its discretion in adopting the

20 Project Approvals without compliance with CEQA, the PZL, the City's General Plan, the Municipal

21 Code, the California Constitution and the Public Trust Doctrine. Its adoption of the Project Approvals

22 therefore violates Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5 in the following respects, among

23 others:

24 a. said approval was not granted in accordance with the procedures required by law
25  including the procedures set forth in CEQA, the PZL, the California Constitution, the City of Richmond

26 General Plan and Municipal Code, and the Public Trust Doctrine;

27 b. said approval was not supported by, or was contrary to, the evidence available to the
28 City; and

IVERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 24 -

1 C. said approval was not based on the findings required by law.

2 90. The City's actions in adopting the Project Approvals without first complying with the

3 procedures required by Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, CEQA, the PZL, the

4 California Constitution, the City of Richmond General Plan and Municipal Code, and the Public Trust
5 Doctrine exceed the City's jurisdiction and constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion. Accordingly, the

6 City's adoption of the Project Approvals is contrary to law and invalid and must be set aside.

7 CONSERVATION GROUPS ARE ENTITLED TO RELIEF

8 91. The paragraphs set forth above are realleged and incorporated herein by reference.

9 92. Conservation Groups are beneficially interested in the City's adoption of the Project
10 Approvals, because the City's approval of this Project poses environmental impacts that will harm

11 Conservation Groups.

12 93. Conservation Groups timely seek appropriate mandamus, declaratory and injunctive relief to

13 prevent the City from attempting to implement any part of the Project Approvals before this action is
14 resolved on its merits.

15 94. An actual controversy exists between Conservation Groups and the City. Conservation
16 Groups contend that the City has acted in violation of applicable law as alleged hereinabove, and must

17 therefore vacate and set aside its adoption of the Project Approvals. Conservation Groups are informed

18 and believe, and thereon allege, that the City disputes these contentions. A judicial resolution of this
19 controversy is therefore necessary and appropriate.

20 95. At all times mentioned herein, the City was able to conduct environmental review and

21 analysis of the Project as required by CEQA, the PZL, the California Constitution, the City General Plan

22 and Municipal Code, and the Public Trust Doctrine. Nonetheless, the City has failed and continues to

23 fail to perform its duty to conduct this required environmental review and analysis under CEQA, the

24 PZL, the California Constitution, the City General Plan and Municipal Code, and the Public Trust

25 Doctrine.

26 96. If the City is not ordered to set aside its adoption of the Project Approvals, Conservation
27 Groups and the public will be irreparably harmed. Conservation Groups have no plain, speedy, and

28 adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. Unless this Court issues its writ of mandate or injunctive

VERIFIED PETITION AND COMPLAINT - 25 -

1 or declaratory relief vacating the City's approval of the Project Approvals, and requiring the City to

2 comply with CEQA, the PZL, the California Constitution, the City General Plan and Municipal Code,

3 and the Public Trust Doctrine, the City's Project Approvals challenged herein would violate applicable

4 law. No monetary damages or other legal remedy could adequately compensate Conservation Groups for

5 the resulting harm to essential environmental reviews and protected public trust interests and
6 environmental quality threatened by the City's adoption of the Project Approvals.

7 RELIEF REQUESTED

8 WHEREFORE, Conservation Groups pray for judgment and further relief as follows:

Q 1. For a peremptory writ of mandate directing the City of Richmond to set aside and vacate its

10 Project Approvals;

11 2. For declaratory relief declaring the Project Approvals to be unlawful;

12 3. For injunctive relief preventing the City of Richmond from implementing the Project

13 Approvals unless and until the City has complied with CEQA, the PZL, the California Constitution, the

14 City General Plan and Municipal Code, and the Public Trust Doctrine;

15 4. For attoreys' fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5;

16 5. For costs incurred in this action; and

17 6. For such other equitable or legal relief as the Court may deem just and proper.
