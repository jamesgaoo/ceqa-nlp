FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

Plaintiff CALIFORNIA RESOURCES CORPORATION ("CRC" or "PlaintifP*) hereby

2 petitions this Court for writ of mandamus pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Section 1085 (or

3 alternatively under Section 1094.5), directed to Respondent and Defendant COUNTY OF

4 VENTURA ("County"), and the VENTURA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS

5 (collectively, "Defendants") and hereby bring this Amended Petition for Writ of Mandamus and

6 Complaint for Declaratory Relief and Damages. By this verified pleading, CRC hereby alleges

7 as follows:

8 INTRODUCTION

1. This action challenges the General Plan Update ("GPU") adopted by the County

10 and the Ventura Board of Supervisors. CRC is informed and believed that that GPU was adopted

11 on September 15, 2020.

12 2. The GPU adds new restrictions for oil and gas development within the County

13 including new setbacks, restrictions on permits, and a prohibition on flaring.

14 3. On November 10, 2020, the Board of Supervisors adopted amendments to the

15 Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance and the Coastal Zoning Ordinance ("Zoning Amendments")

16 modifying permitting requirements for oil and gas exploration and production operations and

17 broadening the scope of the GPU's Oil and Gas Policics.

18 4. In the Complaint for Declaratory Relief and Damages, CRC seeks declaratory

19 relief and damages on the grounds that:

20 a. CRC has a vested right to pursue the full scale of oil and gas operations in the

21 County as authorized under existing permits.

22 b. The adoption of the GPU and Zoning Amendments is a temporary and permanent

23 taking of CRC's private property for public use without prior compensation in

24 violation of Article I, section 19 of the California Constitution and the Takings

25 Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and incorporated

26 by the Fourteenth Amendment.

27

- 2-
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

C. The adoption of the GPU and Zoning Amendments violates CRC's substantive due

2 process under Article I, section 7 of the California Constitution and the Fourteenth

3 Amendment of the United States Constitution. The GPU infringes on CRC's

4 property rights in an arbitrary, irrational, and discretionary manner, which is not

5 related to any legitimate governmental purpose.

6 5. To remedy these injuries, CRC seeks a Writ of Mandamus compelling the County

7 to vacate the GPU and Zoning Amendments as preempted by state and federal law, in excess of the

8 County's authority, and in violation of the California Constitution.

6. In pursuing this action, which involves enforcement of important rights affecting

10 the public interest, CRC will confer a substantial benefit on the general public, citizens of Ventura

11 County, and the State of California, and therefore will be entitled to attorneys' fees and costs

12 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. In addition, CRC will be entitled to recover

13 attorneys' fees and costs as part of its claim for inverse condemnation pursuant to Code of Civil

14 Procedure section 1036.

15 PARTIES

16 7. Plaintiff CRC a is a Delaware corporation engaged in the business of oil and natural

17 gas exploration and production. CRC operates in California's four major oil and gas basins,

18 including San Joaquin, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and Ventura. CRC owns operating interests

19 and/or mineral rights and holds permits in Ventura County affected by the GPU and the Zoning

20 Amendments.

21 8. Defendant COUNTY OF VENTURA, is political subdivision of the State of

22 California with its county seat in the City of San Buenaventura, California, and is a general law

23 county formed pursuant to Article XI, section 1 of the Constitution of the State of California.

24 9. Defendant VENTURA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS is a five-member

25 Board of Supervisors, elected at-large for a staggered four-year term in their respective districts,

26 and the chairmanship rotates annually. The Board of Supervisors is responsible for governing the

27

-3 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

County, providing policy direction, approving the County budget, and representing the County in a

2 number of areas including special districts.

3 10. Plaintiff CRC is unaware of the true names and/or capacities of Respondents and

4 Defendants DOES I through 25, inclusive, and therefore sues said Respondents and Defendants by

5 such fictitious names. Plaintiff will amend this pleading to insert the true names and/or capacities

6 of DOES 1 through 25, inclusive, when the same have been ascertained. Plaintiff is informed and

7 believes and thereon alleges that each such fictitiously named Respondent and Defendant is, in

8 some manner or for some reason, responsible for the damage caused to Plaintiff and is subject to

0 the relief being sought in this pleading.

10 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

11 11. This Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Article I, section 19 of the California

12 Constitution, California Code of Civil Procedure sections 1060, 1085 and 1094.5, and Public

13 Resources Code section 21168.5 (alternatively section 21168).

14 12. CRC has complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5 by serving a

15 notice upon the County of its intent to file this Petition. CRC served the notice on October 13,

16 2020, and served a supplemental notice on December 17, 2020. Proof of Service of this

17 supplemental notification, with the supplemental notification, is attached as Exhibit A.

18 13. CRC has previously elected to prepare the record of proceedings in the abovc-

19 captioned proceeding or to pursue an alternative method of record preparation pursuant to Public

20 Resources Code Section 21167.6(b)(2).

21 14. CRC has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section

22 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by mailing a copy of this Petition to the

23 California Attorney General on October 15, 2020, and served a supplemental notice on

24 Dccember 17, 2020. A copy of the letter transmitting the Petition to the Attorney General with

25 Proof of Service is attached as Exhibit B.

26 15. CRC has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant action

27 and has exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the extent required by law, including,

- 4 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

but not limited to, submitting extensive written comments objecting to the certification of the

2 EIR and approval of the GPU. All issues raised in the petition for a writ of mandamus were

3

4 raised before the County by CRC, other members of the public, or public agencies prior to
approval of the GPU.

5 16. This Amended Petition is timely filed within 30 days after Respondents' decision

6

~J to issue a Notice of Determination in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167(c),
and the Amended Petition is filed within 35 days of the Respondents' positing of Notices of

8 Exemption for the Zoning Amendments.

9 17.

10 CRC has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the court of ordinary law
because CRC will be irreparably harmed by the ensuing damage caused by implementation of

11

12 the GPU and Respondents' violations of CEQA, as well as other aspects of state law. In the

13 absence of such remedies, the County's approval will remain in effect in violation of state law.

18. No claim is required to be filed to maintain an inverse condemnation claim

14 against a public entity pursuant to California Government Code section 905.1.

15 19. Venue is proper in this Court because CRC's operates oil and gas wells in

16

17 Ventura County, Defendant Board of Supervisors of Ventura County operates in Ventura County,

18 Ventura County is a public entity located in Ventura County, and the violations of Plaintiffs' rights
occurred in Ventura County.

19 FACTUAL AND LEGAL STATEMENT

20 A. Oil and Gas Development in Ventura County

21 20.

22 Oil and gas have been produced in Ventura County for over a century. Production

23 of these resources commenced in Ventura County after the discovery of the Ojai oil field in the late

24 1860s. Numerous other oil fields have since been discovered in the County, which has become one

25 of the major producing areas in the State of California. Over 12,000 wells have been drilled in the

26 Ventura Basin (which covers Ventura County and a portion of Los Angeles County). There are

27 currently about 3,800 active wells in Ventura County. There are approximately 57 oil companies

5-
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 operating in Ventura County under the authority of 135 conditional use permits granted by the

2 County which authorize oil and gas activities.

3 21. Crude oil production in the County totaled 6.9 million barrels in 2018, making

4 Ventura the fourth largest oil producing county in California.'

5 22. The local oil and gas industry also provides valuable economic and fiscal benefits

6 to Ventura County. The industry is an important source of high-paying, full-time jobs, many of

7 them in occupations open to those with high-school and technical degrees. An estimated 1,950 jobs

8 in Ventura County are attributable to the oil and gas production industry, of which 760 are workers

9 directly employed by oil major oil producers and support companies, and 1,190 are workers

10 employed by companies that supply goods and services to the oil and gas producers and their

11 employees.

12 23. The oil and gas industry is also an important source of taxes paid to state and local

13 governments in the region, supporting local schools, public safcty, and other vital services. The

14 industry is also responsible for $36 million in state taxes and $20 million in local taxes annually in

15 the County. The local taxes support school districts, public safcty, and other vital services within

16 the County. Contributions from the oil and gas production industry are expected to expand over the

17 next decade prior to the adoption of the GPU, assuming that "that producers are able to obtain

18 permits and initiate new projects to replace natural decline in oil and gas output from existing

19 wells over time.3

20 24. The General Plan, which is mandated by state law, sets forth the goals, policies

21 and directions the County will take in managing planning for the future. The GPU contains eight

22 policies (COS 7.1- COS 7.8) regarding oil and gas development in the County.

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

B. CRC's Operations in Ventura County

2 25. CRC currently owns considerable acreage in Ventura County, in both mineral fee

3 and leasehold, and has invested significantly in exploration activities required to further develop

4 these interests. CRC also holds valuable property interests as lessee and operator of mineral rights

5 within the County.

6 26. CRC operates and develops 27 fields in the Ventura Basin consisting of primary
7 conventional, improved oil recovery, enhanced oil recovery and unconventional project types.

8 CRC holds 232,000 net mineral acres in the basin, 79 percent of which CRC holds in fee.

9 27. CRC holds forty-one Special Use or Conditional Use Permits ("CUPs") in

10 Ventura County, including many permits that allow for the continued drilling of new wells on the

11 property without additional modifications. Many of these permits provide CRC with the right to

12 continue the "drilling for and extraction of oil, gas and other hydrocarbon substances and

13 installing, and using, buildings, equipment and other appurtenances accessory thereto....ยป

14 C. The County's Adoption of the GPU

15 28. California law requires that each county and city in the state develop and adopt a

16 general plan. (Gov. Code ยง 65300.) The general plan consists of a statement of development

17 policics and includes a diagram or diagrams and text setting forth objectives, principles, standards,

18 and plan proposals. a It is a comprehensive long-term plan for the physical development of the

19 county or city. In this sense, it is "blueprint" for development.

20 29. By statute, the general plan is required to be updated "periodically." ." (Gov. Code

21 ccp 65103, subd. (a).) While there is no requirement for how often to update the general plan, the

22 planning period has traditionally bcen 15-20 years.

23 30. The last time the County had updated its General Plan was in 2005. In 2015, the

24 County began the process for updating its General Plan.

25 31. On January 14, 2019, the County of Ventura, Resource Management Agency,

26 Planning Division prepared and distributed a Notice of Preparation ("NOP"). The purpose of the

27 NOP was to request that interested persons assist the County by identifying significant

- 7-
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

-

2 environmental issues, mitigation measures, and the range of reasonable alternatives that should be
addressed in the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR").

3 32.

4 Comments were received at a scoping meeting held at the County Government

5 Center on January 30, 2019, and additional comments were submitted directly to the County. On

6 or about May 9, 2019, the County published a preliminary draft of the GPU for public review.

33.

7 The GPU is comprised of two primary documents: one containing the goals,

8 policies, and implementation programs (sometimes referred to as the "Policy Document"), and a
Background Report, which summarizes the County's existing environmental and regulatory setting

10 and describes a wide range of topics including demographics, public facilities, and resources. The

Background Report is over 1,000 pages long.

11 34.

12 There were over 400 new goals, policies, and programs that were added to the

13 GPU. In addition, more than half of the prior 2005 General Plan goals, policies, and programs
were carried over into the GPU.

14 35.

15 The GPU contained a set of Oil and Gas Policies that were purportedly included

16 to "effectively and safely manage the exploration, production, and drilling of oil and gas resources

17 in Ventura County" (referred to herein as the "Oil and Gas Policies").3 These Oil and Gas Policies
include, but are not limited to, the following:

18

19 COS-7.2 - The County shall require new discretionary oil wells to be located a

20 minimum of 1,500 feet from residential dwellings and 2,500 from any school.

COS-7.4

21 The County shall require discretionary development for oil and gas

22 exploration and production to use electrically-powered equipment from 100 percent

23 renewable sources and cogeneration, where feasible, to reduce air pollution and

24 greenhouse gas emissions from internal combustion engines and equipment.

COS-7.6

25 The County shall evaluate discretionary development to identify any
abandoned oil and gas wells on the project site.

26

27 The a GPU contains a series of policies that are purportedly included to "effectively and safely manage the exploration, production, and drilling of oil and gas resources in Ventura County" (referred to herein as the "Oil and Gas Policies").

- 8โข
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

COS-7.7 - The County shall require new discretionary oil wells to use pipelines to

2 convey oil and produced water; oil and produced water shall not be trucked.
COS-7.8 - The County shall require that gases emitted from all new discretionary oil

4 and gas wells shall be collected and used or removed for sale or proper disposal.
Flaring or venting shall only be allowed in cases of emergency or for testing purposes.

6 36. However, as alleged herein, the Oil and Gas Policies would have the effect of

7 eliminating oil and gas exploration and production in Ventura through the adoption of these unduly

8 restrictive and unlawful policies.

37. The Draft EIR and GPU were available for public comment period, during which

10 time 314 public agencies, organizations, and individuals submitted letters and email

11 correspondence numerous. CRC submitted comments during this period.

12 38. As noted in submitted comments, several GPU Oil and Gas Policies are infeasible

13 or regulate areas preempted by federal law. The greenhouse gas emission analysis relies upon

14 several policies that are preempted by state or federal law, violate existing private property rights,

15 and are simply infeasible. These included several of the Oil and Gas Policies such as Policies

16 COS-7.2, 7.3, 7.4, and 7.7, and implementation programs L (well stimulation treatment evaluation)

17 and M (oil and gas operations tax).

18 39. For example, Policies COS-7.7 and 7.8 are preempted, as a local agency cannot

19 eliminate the use of trucking of oil or limit flaring to County-defined instances of "testing" or
20 "emergency." Those activities are governed by state and federal law. Adoption of policies that are

21 unlawful or that are infeasible results in an erroneous analysis, not based upon substantial

22 evidence. (See, e.g., Federation of Hillside & Canyon Assns. v. City of L.A. (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th

23 1252, 1261 [mitigation measures must be enforceable].)

24 40. On February 28, 2020, the California Department of Conservation, Geologic

25 Energy Management Division ("CalGEM") also submitted comments on the Draft EIR. CalGEM

26 explained how the agency already regulates many of the areas that the GPU seeks to regulate. For

27 instance, CalGEM commented that General Plan 6.10 Implementation Program L requires ongoing

- 9 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

County evaluation of potential effects from well stimulation treatment and thermal enhanced

2 recovery, but that CalGEM already oversees well stimulation treatment and underground injection

3 control. CalGEM informed the County that "under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the U.S.

4 Environmental Protection Agency has delegated primacy authority over oil and gas injection wells

5 to the CalGEM [underground injection control] Program." Further, Oil and Gas Policy COS-7.8

6 requires "gases emitted from all new discretionary oil and gas wells shall be collected and used or

7 removed for sale or proper disposal," but that Public Resources Code ยง 3300 already declares that

8 "unreasonable waste of natural gas" is unlawful. Finally, CalGEM commented that Oil and Gas

9 Policy COS-7.6 indicates that the County "shall evaluate discretionary development to identify any

10 abandoned oil and gas wells on the project site," but that Public Resources Code ยง 3208.1 already

11 "establishes well re-abandonment responsibility when a previously plugged and abandoned well

12 will be impacted by planned property development or construction activities."

13 41. The Oil and Gas Policies unlawfully conflict with numerous state statutes and

14 regulations that comprehensively regulate virtually all aspects of oil and gas operations. Oil and
15 gas operation in California are specifically governed by Division 3 of the Public Resources Code

16 (Pub. Res. Code $3106, et seq.) and its implementing regulations (14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง 1712, et

17 seq.). In addition, CalGEM is explicitly guided by a dual mandate to promote the development of

18 California's oil and gas resources and to supervise such operations to prevent damage to lifc,

19 health, property, and natural resources. (Pub. Res. Code ยง 3106). Given California's all-

20 encompassing statute and regulatory scheme that governs oil and gas operations, the Oil and Gas

21 Policies conflict with comprehensive state regulations and are preempted.

22 42. On July 16, 2020, the County held a public hearing to consider and make

23 recommendations to the Board of Supervisors regarding adoption and approval of the GPU and

24 GPU Background Report and certification of the Final EIR. (Planning Division Case Number

25 PL17-0141). The County ultimately made these recommendations to the Board of Supervisors in

26 advance of their public hearing scheduled for September 1, 2020.

27

10 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

43. On September 14, 2020, CRC submitted a cure and correct letter regarding Brown

2 Act violations that occurred during the September 1, 2020 hearing. (Gov. Code, ยง 54950, et seq.)

3 Among other concerns, members of the Board of Supervisors discussed the General Plan Update

4 during a break when the public was not present, the public was not provided an adequate agenda,

5 nor was the public provided the opportunity for full and informed participation.

6 44. Under the Brown Act, "[a]ll meetings of the legislative body of a local agency

7 shall be open and public." (Gov. Code, ยง 54953.) The purpose of the Brown Act is to ensure that

8 local government conducts the public's business openly, SO that the public may be well informed.

9 (Id., ยง 54950.) Board of Supervisors Chair Kelly Long reiterated this critical element of public

10 meetings during the meeting stating that: "it is very important that we have transparency and

11 public input" during the process.

12 45. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that, during a break in the

13 public session, Supervisor Bennett could be heard discussing the content of the General Plan

14 Update, with another Supervisor, due to an issue with his mute button. In response to a Public

15 Records Act request, the County has also recently produced text messages between Supervisor

16 Bennett and Supervisor Parks discussing the revision of maps included in the General Plan. The

17 Brown Act prohibits "serial meetings" in which a series of individual contacts are conducted

18 between Supervisors. "A majority of the members of a legislative body shall not . .. use a series of
19 communications of any kind, directly or through intermediaries, to discuss, deliberate, or take

20 action on any item of business that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the legislative body."

21 (Gov. Code, ยง 54952.2, subd. (b)(1).)

22 46. The Brown Act also prohibits requiring registration to attend a public meeting. No

23 in-person participation is available, the agenda notes that the building is closed to the public, and

24 notes that participants should attend online. However, none of the provided options for submitting

25 comments are sufficient. The agenda notes that to comment via Zoom, a participant is required to

26 register. Plaintiff is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that comments made while

27 watching the livestream are only read at the "discretion of the chair" and thus this is not an

- 11 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

adequate substitute for full and open participation. The agenda does not provide the necessary

2 clarity required by the Brown Act that registration cannot be required to attend a public meeting.

3 (Gov. Code, ยง 54953.3.)

4 47. The Brown Act requires that an agenda be posted at least 72 hours before a
regular meeting and forbids action on any item not on that agenda. The legislative body may not

6 take any action on an item not appearing on the posted agenda. The purpose of the agenda
requirements is to inform the public of proposed action and to encourage public participation in

8 government decision making. On September 1, 2020, during its meeting, the Board of Supervisors
acted to combine its consideration of Item 39, a hotly contested and debated General Plan Update

10 which encompassed a large range of topics, with additional Items 34 and 35. However, Items 34

11 and 35 proposed further additions to the General Plan Update, which were never heard by the

12 Planning Commission. Further, the subject matter of Items 34 and 35 was not introduced prior to

13 the close of public comment on Item 39. The "staff report" to describe these items was held and

14 delivered, not by staff, but by Supervisors Bennett and Parks, after public comment had been

15 closed on the newly combined items. As a result, the public was deprived of an opportunity to

16 comment in any meaningful way on Items 34 and 35.

17 48. The Cure and Correct letter issued by CRC is attached hereto as Exhibit C.

18 49. During the September 15, 2020 public hearing, the Board of Supervisors voted to

19 certify the Final EIR and adopt the GPU. The Board of Supervisors signed the Notice of

20 Determination on September 15, 2020 and filed it with the Governor's Office of Planning &

21 Research, State Clearinghouse on September 16, 2020, and with the County Clerk on September

22 17, 2020.

23 50. The GPU takes effect 30 days after the Board of Supervisors' adoption.

24 Accordingly, the GPU takes effect on or about October 15, 2020.

25 D. The GPU's Impact on CRC's Vested Rights

26 51. The doctrine of vested rights seeks to protect property owners and developers who

27 have substantially relied on past permits and proceeded accordingly with the government's

- 12 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

acknowledgement. The a doctrine protects a permit holder's right not only to construct, but also to

2 use the premises as authorized by the permit. (Cnly. of San Diego v. McClurken (1951) 37 Cal.2d

3 683, 691.)

4 52. CRC has a fully vested right to continue and to complete the development and

5 production of its oil and gas resources in the County, consistent with long-established plans,

6 including CRC's vested rights in County permits issued or assigned to CRC, and CRC's vested

7 rights to proceed to develop and produce its oil and gas resources in the County in accordance with

8 these lawfully issued permits issued by the County and following procedures and permits

9 established by the State of California.

10 53. CRC or its predecessors have drilled wells and installed equipment with the

11 expectation that additional wells could be drilled under these permits. "The very nature and use of

12 an extractive business contemplates the continuance of such use of the entire parcel of land as a

13 whole, without limitation or restriction to the immediate area excavated at the time the ordinance

14 was passed." (Hansen Brothers Enterprises, Inc. V. Bd. of Supervisors (1996) 12 Cal.4th 533,

15 553.)

16 54. CRC's vested rights prevent the County from prohibiting activities authorized by

17 CRC's permits on the basis of the policies set forth in the GPU. The GPU Oil and Gas Policies rely

18 upon the pending Zoning Amendments to negate and restrict CRC's vested rights in its issued

19 permits.

20 55. CRC's vested rights may not be abridged absent due process and a finding of

21 nuisance or payment of adequate compensation. (See Trans-Oceanic Oil Corp v. Santa Barbara

22 (1948) 85 Cal.App.2d 776, 789.)

23 56. The County has not found that any of CRC's oil and gas operations constitute a

24 nuisance. To the contrary, at all times relevant herein, CRC's continued operations and drilling

25 have occurred lawfully, in compliance with its CUPs, and in a manner that docs not create harm or

26 a nuisance to local communities. As these operations are not a nuisance, the County cannot impair

27 CRC's vested rights.

- 13 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

57. The GPU Oil and Gas Policies ignore CRC's rights under the diminishing asset

2 doctrine to use the entire parcel of land for its extractive business. The GPU Oil and Gas Policies

3 would have the effect not only of shutting down a business that has mutually benefitted the County

4 for decades, but also of terminating the right to produce oil - an extraordinarily valuable resource

5 that reduces the need for California to rely on foreign oil resources, which are much more carbon-

6 intensive. For example, the setback restrictions pursuant to GPU Policy COS-7.2 (Oil Well

7 Distance Criteria) will exclude large sections of CRC's existing oilfields from new wells, that

8 would otherwise be allowed under existing permits.

58. The restrictions pursuant to GPU Policies COS-7.7 (Conveyance for Oil and

10 Produced Water) and COS-7.8 (Gas Collection, Use, and Disposal) will further impact CRC's

11 ongoing and future oil operations within the County. Many of CRC's oil fields require the use of

12 trucks to transport either produced water or oil, and the use of flaring to dispose of unneeded gas.

13 The combination of the new restrictions in the GPU Oil and Gas Policies will make it impossible

14 to continue production with new wells in many fields currently operated by CRC.

15 59. CRC has clearly exhibited an intent to continue and to complete the development

16 and production of its oil and gas resources within its oilfields within the County. The continued

17 development of these resources is progression of the extractive activity into all areas of CRC's

18 oil and gas fields as authorized by its permits. The County intends to prohibit CRC's oil and gas

19 operations by way of the GPU and Zoning Amendments.

20 60. CRC seeks a judicial declaration of the rights and obligations of the respective

21 parties. Judicial intervention in this dispute, and a declaration by the Court, is necessary to resolve

22 whether CRC has a vested right to continue and to complete the development and production of its

23 oil and gas resources within the County. The County's adoption of the GPU Oil and Gas Policies

24 irreparably harms and will continue to irreparably harm CRC based on the substantial economic

25 harm and operational harm that will flow from application of the GPU.

26 E. The County's Adoption of the Zoning Amendments

27 61. Zoning amendments to Article 7, Section 8107-5 of the Ventura County Non-

- 14 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

* Coastal Zoning Ordinance ("NCZO") and Article 5, Section 8175-5.7 of the Ventura County

2 Coastal Zoning Ordinance ("CZO") were adopted by the Board of Supervisors on November 10,

3 2020.

4 62. The County's recent adoption of the Zoning Amendments began with

5 allegations of a potential threat to groundwater in the Fox Canyon area purportedly caused by

6 oil and gas exploration and production operations. According to the County Resource

7 Management Agency, on February 25, 2019, the United States Geologic Survey (USGS)

8 reported that it had allegedly found indications that petroleum-related gases were migrating into

9 the Fox Canyon aquifer system in the vicinity of existing oil wells utilizing cyclic steam

10 injection.

11 63. Accordingly, the Resource Management Agency recommended that the Board

12 of Supervisors direct the Planning Division to return to the Board with a proposed interim

13 ordinance pursuant to Government Code section 65858 to temporarily prohibit the County's

14 approval of new oil and gas wells, and re-drilling of existing oil and gas wells, for oil production

15 that will utilize steam injection in the vicinity of potable groundwater aquifers while the County

16 studies potential regulations for this land use. The Resource Management Agency further
17 recommended that the Board of Supervisors direct the Planning Division to also study potential

18 amendments to the County's zoning ordinances to require discretionary approval of new

19 development under long-term oil and gas permits. These recommendations were placed on the

20 Board of Supervisors' agenda as Agenda Item 46 for the Board's April 9. 2019 regular public

21 meeting.

22 64. At the conclusion of the April 9, 2019 regular public meeting, the Board

23 approved both recommendations.

24 65. On April 23, June 4, and November 5, 2019, the Board approved and then

25 extended the proposed interim urgency ordinance prohibiting County approval of new oil wells,

26 and the re-drilling of existing wells, that would utilize steam injection on a portion of the Oxnard

27 Plan overlying the Fox Canyon aquifer that was the subject of the USGS study. The interim

- 15 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

- urgency ordinance was intended to remain in effect until December 7, 2020, unless terminated

2 sooner by the Board.

3 66. The Board took these actions even though the purported concerns regarding

4 allegations of a potential threat to groundwater in the Fox Canyoner area were conclusively

5 proven false by the County itself. In a Technical Memorandum, dated May 16, 2019, and

6

7 revised October 29, 2019, Dan Tormey, of Catalyst Environmental Solutions, the County's

expert

8 consultant for oil and gas issues, stated that the USGS groundwater monitoring results
"do not indicate that oil and gas operations have impacted groundwater quality." And,

9

10 furthermore, Catalyst "did not identify ongoing threats to the groundwater quality" from oil and

gas activities.

11 67.

12 Nevertheless, in response to the Board's direction to study potential amendments

13 to the County's zoning ordinances to require discretionary approval of new development under

14 long-term oil and gas permits, County Counsel, in consultation with the Planning Division,

15 provided the Board with a written report that was the subject of Item 3 of the Board's September

16 10, 2019 regular public meeting. The report states, among other things, that the County can

gas

17 legally require discretionary approval and environmental review of proposed new oil and

18 production facilities on land covered by long-term permits, and that the County can, in general,
apply its oil development standards to all existing oil and gas production facilities.

19 68. The Ventura County Board of Supervisors directed staff to study potential

20 amendments to the NCZO on April 9, 2019. (July 2020 Staff Report for PL20-0052.)

21 69. A potential draft amendment to the NCZO was attached to the September 10,

22 2019 staff report. At the conclusion of the September 10, 2019 item, the Board directed "the

23 Planning Division to

24 prepare draft amendments to the County's zoning ordinances that are

25 consistent with the potential draft amendment attached to the County Counsel report to be
processed through the standard land use public hearing process." (July 2020 Staff Report for

26 PL20-0052.)

27 70. The draft EIR regarding the GPU was published in January 2020; the Planning

- 16 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

Commission held a public meeting considering the GPU on July 16, 2020. This meeting was just

2 two weeks before the Planning Commission held a public meeting considering the Zoning
Amendments on July 30, 2020.

71. On July 30, 2020, the County Planning Commission considered the Zoning
Amendments at a public hearing. The purpose of the hearing was to determine whether the
Planning Commission should recommend that the Board: (1) adopt, not adopt, or adopt with
modification the Zoning Amendments; (2) find that the Zoning Amendments are exempt from

8 CEQA; and (3) find that the Zoning Amendments are consistent with the goals, policies, and

9 programs of the Ventura County General Plan, the Ventura County Coastal Area Plan, and the

10 Coastal Act.

11 72. The Zoning Amendments modify requirements for discretionary permitting for

12 certain new oil and gas exploration and production operations. The Zoning Amendments will

13 require new discretionary permitting approval for all new wells or other oil and gas exploration

14 and production operations, even if they are currently authorized under the terms of existing

15 permits, and expand the application of the current development design guidelines and operational

16 standards.

17 73. The Zoning Amendments included three major substantive changes to the NCZO

18 and CZO. They amend NCZO section 8107-5.2 and CZO section 8175-5.7.2. to require the

19 issuance of a new discretionary CUP, or approval of a discretionary permit adjustment or

20 modification, to authorize all new oil and gas development, including activities previously

21 allowed under existing permits, unless the proposed development is specifically described under

22 an existing discretionary permit. New development triggering the need for discretionary

23 approval includes, but is not limited to, the installation of new wells, tanks and other oil field

24 facilities, and the re-drilling or deepening of existing wells. Because these approvals would
25 require a discretionary permit the County would subject the projects to environmental review

26 under CEQA.

27 74. In addition, the Zoning Amendments amend NCZO 8107-5.2 and CZO 8175-

- 17 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 5.7.2, to state that the County's current oil development design guidelines and operational

2 standards uniformly apply to all oil and gas exploration and production operations to the extent:

3 (1) such guidelines and standards would impose more stringent requirements than those set forth

4 in existing permit conditions, laws, or regulations applicable to the operation; and (2) application

5 of such guidelines and standards would not impair any vested right of an operator under

6 California law.

7 75. The Zoning Amendments also amend NCZO section 8107-5.4 and CZO section

8 8175-5.7.5, to state that improvements that are the subject of a zoning clearance must be

9 developed within 180 days of permit issuance.

10 76. a As a result, the Zoning Amendments drastically alter the requirements for oil and

11 gas development in Ventura County.

12 77. In addition, by altering the activities that would require a CUP, the Zoning

13 Amendments fundamentally expand the operations subject to the GPU.

14 78. A Planning Commission Staff Report drafted by County Counsel in advance of

15 the July 30, 2020 Planning Commission hearing determined that the NCZO amendment was

16 exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15308 (the 8 Class 8 Exemption) as an

17 action taken by a regulatory agency, as authorized by state or local ordinance, "to assure the

18 maintenance, restoration, enhancement, or protection of the environment where the regulatory

19 process involves procedures for protection of the environment." The Planning Division staff

20 further determined that no "unusual circumstances" or other exceptions set forth in CEQA

21 Guidelines section 15300.2 prelude use of this categorical exemption.

22 79. In addition, Planning Commission Staff Report stated that the CZO amendment

23 was exempt from CEQA pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21080.9, which exempts

24 local governments from preparing an EIR or other CEQA document in connection with an

25 amendment to a Local Coastal Program ("LCP"). Instead, the LCP amendment must be certified

26 by the California Coastal Commission and is subject to Coastal Commission review for
27 compliance with the Coastal Act of 1972.

18
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

80. On November 10, 2020, the Board of Supervisors held a public meeting to

2 consider adopting the Planning Commission's recommendations on the Zoning Amendments.

3 81. An agenda for the Board of Supervisors' meeting was posted on the County's

4 website in advance of the meeting. The proposed actions regarding the Zoning Amendments

5 appeared as Agenda Item 47 on the Board's Agenda.

6 82. Agenda Item 47 contained several supporting materials, including a "Board

7 Letter" from the County Resource Management Agency, which contained certain recommended

8 actions, including that the Board: (1) find that the NCZO is exempt from CEQA under CEQA

9 Guidelines section 15308 and no unusual circumstances or any other exception set forth in

10 CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2 applies; (2) find that the CZO is exempt from CEQA pursuant

11 to Public Resources Code section 21080.9 as an amendment to the County's LCP; (3) find that

12 the Zoning Amendments are consistent with the goals, policies, and programs of the Ventura

13 County General Plan, the Ventura County Coastal Area Plan, and the Coastal Act; (4) adopt the

14 NCZO amendments; and (5) adopt the CZO amendments subject to Coastal Commission

15 certification.

16 83. During this November 10, 2020 meeting, the Supervisors discussed an updated

17 Board Letter which asserted "it is appropriate to rely on that certified EIR for the extension of

18 those policies to new oil and gas wells, and reliance on that ElR is an independent basis under

19 CEQA for the adoption of the proposed zoning ordinance amendments.24 Notably, a summary

20 of this updated recommendation was not included in the Agenda posted on the County's website

21 in advance of the November 10 Board meeting. The Agenda did not cite or refer to the EIR for

22 the GPU or CEQA Guidelines section 15162. In addition, as the clerk had conceded, the County

23 had not circulated the revised Board Letter to the public prior to or during the November 10

24 meeting. The revised Board Letter was subsequently uploaded to the County's website

25 embedded in a hyperlink to Agenda Item 47 after the November 10 meeting had already

26 concluded. The County therefore failed to notify the public of this proposed finding in advance

27 4 Ventura County Resource Management Agency, revised letter to Board of Supervisors, Nov. 10, 2020, p 3.

- 19 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

- of the November 10 meeting.

2 84. The Supervisors voted 3-2 to approve Agenda Item 47 regarding the adoption of

3 the Zoning Amendments.

4 85. The Notices of Exemption for the NCZO and CZO were filed on November 13,

5 2020.

6 F. The Zoning Amendments' Impact on CRC's Vested Rights

7 86. Since 1947, oil and gas exploration and production projects were identified as a

8 "special use" requiring discretionary approval that could only be authorized by the Board of

9 Supervisors following the consideration and advisory recommendation of the Planning

10 Commission.

11 87. Ventura County has historically recognized producers' existing permits as

12 creating vested rights to continue the production of oil and gas. (County Counsel's 2014 Office

13 Memorandum regarding Legal Analysis of Antiquated Oilfield Conditional Use Permits.)

14 88. The first discretionary special use permitsยฎ issued for oil and gas operations

15 typically authorized the continuation or expansion of operations which existed before the

16 County adopted its first zoning ordinance and imposed a permit requirement in 1947.

17 Approximately 60 percent of the wells in Ventura County are operated under permits that were

18 first issued between 1948 and the end of 1950.

19 89. CRC operates under or holds several long-term special use permits, which

20 generally authorize operators to use specifically-described parcels of land for "drilling for and

21 extraction of oil, gas and other hydrocarbon substances and installing, and using, buildings,

22 equipment and other appurtenances accessory thereto...." Unless subsequently modified, these

23 permits did not contain expiration dates or specifically identify the location or number of wells that

24 could be drilled on the permitted permit. Thus, once vested, these permits authorize the continued

25 drilling of new wells and installation of accessory facilities, and cannot be unilaterally modified or

26

27 Special use permits are the predecessors to the County's CUPs and are sometimes hereinafter referred to as CUPs or long-term permits.

- 20 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

r cancelled without a showing a of nuisance. While labeled as "antiquated" permits by the County,

2 these permits provide CRC with a vested a right to pursue oil and gas development in the County.

3 90. The Zoning Amendments require that new oil and gas development must be

4 specifically identified or authorized by a discretionary CUP, regardless of whether an existing

5 permit broadly authorizes oil and gas development activities.

6 91. According to the Zoning Amendments, a new oil and gas exploration and

7 production operation, or component thereof, triggering the need for a new discretionary approval

8 would include, but is not limited to, the installation of any permanent structure, the drilling of new

9 wells, and the re-drilling or deepening of existing wells, which are all currently subject to

10 ministerial rather than discretionary approvals under the long-term permits.

11 92. The Zoning Amendments also provide that the County's current oil development

12 design guidelines and operational standards uniformly apply to all oil and gas exploration and

13 production operations. CRC is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the County intends

14 to apply these new standards to existing wells and operations.

15 93. All of these Zoning Amendments violate the established law of vested rights.

16 94. Subjecting long-term permits to discretionary approval for any new operation will

17 unlawfully impair the constitutionally protected vested property rights of the holders of such

18 permits. Indeed, the Zoning Amendments contradict the County Counsel's own legal

19 memorandum, in which it concluded that the County's "ability to impose new conditions on

20 antiquated oilfield permits is very limited. Because of the vested rights doctrine and constitutional

21 protections afforded to these permits, the County can impose new, narrowly tailored conditions on

22 these permits only when a compelling public necessity, such aS danger, harm or public nuisance,

23 or significant violations exist, and not through an ordinary exercise of the police power for the

24 general welfare." (County Counsel's 2014 Office Memorandum regarding Legal Analysis of

25 Antiquated Oilfield Conditional Use Permits, emphasis added.) The County also previously

26 recognized that "when a conditional use permit has been issued and relied upon by the permittee,

27

โข 21 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

2 giving rise to a vested right, the permit becomes immunized from impairment and revocation by
subsequent government action." (Id., emphasis added.)

3 95. CRC is informed and believes and thereon alleges that, given the County's history

5 of delaying action on or rejecting new permit approvals, the requirement to obtain a new

6 discretionary permit from the County prior to any new oil and gas exploration or production

7 operation is fundamentally equivalent to precluding CRC from conducting these operations.

96. CRC and its predecessor have performed substantial work and incurred

8

o substantial liabilities in operating under its existing permits, investing in and installing

10 infrastructure and equipment for the oil-producing properties at issue with the expectation that

11 additional wells could be drilled. (See Hansen Brothers Enter: v. Bd. of Supervisors (1996) 12

12 Cal.4th 533, 587 ["[t]he very nature and use of an extractive business contemplates the

13 continuance of such use of the entire parcel of land as a whole, without limitation or restriction

14 to the immediate area excavated at the time the ordinance was passed"].) As a result of CRC's

15 operations in implementing the permitted use of drilling for and extraction of oil, gas, and other

16 hydrocarbon substances, CRC has acquired a vested right under these permits to continue the
construction authorized by these permits.

17 G. Inverse Condemnation

18 97.

19 By purporting to (1) eliminate CRC's vested right to continue and to complete the

20 development and production of its oil and gas resources within the County and (2) to prevent all

21 future oil and gas operations in the County, the GPU Oil and Gas policies and Zoning

22 Amendments, both separately and combined, effect a per se taking of and/or damage to CRC's

23 property, without just compensation, in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States
Constitution and Article I, section 19 of the California Constitution.

24 98.

25 The vested rights rule is grounded upon the constitutional principle that a vested

26 right is a property right which may not be taken without due process of law or just compensation.

27 (Urban Renewal Agency v. Cal. Coastal Zone Conservation Com. (1975) 15 Cal.3d 577, 583-84.)
"Under the law of this state the landowner has a property right in oil and gas beneath the surface,

22
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

not in the nature of an absolute title to the oil and gas in place, but as an exclusive right to drill

2 upon his property for these substances."(Bernstein v. Bush (1947) 29 Cal.2d 773, 778.) "This is a

3 right which is fas much entitled to protection as the property itself, and the undue restriction of the

4 use thereof is as much a taking 'for constitutional purposes as appropriating or destroying it."

5 (Ibid., citation omitted.)

6 99. The setback limitations preclude the use of CRC's existing operational lands for

7 future wells and act as a taking of CRC's vested property interests. In addition, the policy that

8 precludes trucking of produced oil eliminates the value of future oil reserves in place for those

9 fields where pipeline is not economically feasible and is a taking under the federal and state

10 constitutions. The County's effort to ban CRC from accessing public streets and highways utilized

11 by all other businesses to get their products to market will result in millions of dollars in economic

12 losses. Furthermore, requiring new permits for oil and gas exploration, production, drilling, and

13 related operations will prevent CRC from utilizing the resources they are currently legally

14 permitted to pursue. Furthermorc, eliminating the vested rights contained in CRC's pre-1960

15 permits which previously allowed for the drilling of new wells and related activities similarly

16 prevents CRC from utilizing the resources they are currently legally permitted to pursue.

17 100. In the alternative, application of the GPU Oil and Gas Policies and the Zoning

18 Amendments effects a taking of CRC's property under the principles of Penn Central

19 Transportation Co. V. New York City (1978) 438 U.S. 104. (Id. at p. 138 n.36.) The adoption of

20 the GPU Oil and Gas Policies eliminates substantially all economically viable use of CRC's oil

21 and gas fields within the County for the benefit of the public without prior compensation to CRC.

22 Furthermore, the County eliminated the vested rights contained in CRC's long-term permits which

23 previously allowed for the drilling, re-drilling, or deepening of new wells and related operations.

24 This action prevents CRC from utilizing the resources that it is currently legally permitted to

25 pursue. The adoption of the Zoning Amendments will eliminate substantially all cconomically

26 viable operations under CRC's existing long-term permits (See, e.g., Lucas v. S.C. Coastal Council

27 (1992) 505 U.S. 1003.)

23
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

101. CRC's interests in its oil and gas fields within the County and long-term permits

2 have substantial value, which will a be substantially lost as a result of the GPU's Oil and Gas

3 Policies and Zoning Amendments. Even taking into account the existing production occurring at

4 CRC's oilfields within the County, both the GPU's Oil and Gas Policies and Zoning Amendments

5 will cause the loss of nearly all of the available oil development opportunities within certain fields

6 (and thus their economic value).

7 102. The GPU Oil and Gas Policies and Zoning Amendments will cause a significant

8 interference with CRC's distinct, investment-backed expectations in these fields. "[I]f the law

9 effects an unreasonable, oppressive, or unwarranted interference with an existing use, or a planned

10 use for which a substantial investment in development costs has been made, the ordinance may be

11 invalid as applied to that property is unless compensation is paid." (Hansen Brothers Enterprises,

12 Inc. V. Bd. of Supervisors, supra, 12 Cal.4th at pp. 551-52.)

13 103. The County's adoption of the GPU Oil and Gas Policies and Zoning Amendments

14 also substantially impairs CRC's property rights in its oil fields within the County for the benefit

15 of the public without prior compensation to CRC. (Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (2005) 544 U.S.

16 528, 540.)

17 104. The GPU Oil and Gas Policies and Zoning Amendments will force CRC to bear

18 public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole. In

19 taking such action, the County violated Article 1, Section 19 of the California Constitution, which

20 prohibits the temporary or permanent taking or damaging of private property for public use

21 without prior, just compensation. Further, the County violated the takings clause of the Fifth

22 Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment, which

23 prohibits the temporary or permanent taking of private property for public use without prior, just

24 compensation.

25 105. The individual impacts on oil and gas production as a result of the GPU and the

26 Zoning Amendments in the County are compounded by County's simultaneous adoption of thesc
27 related policies.

โข 24 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

106. The combined impacts of the GPU policies and the Zoning Amendments have

2 a created a de facto denial of activities that historical required only ministerial approval under vested

3 permits.

4 107. The changes affect the vast majority of CRC's current permits.

5 108. The County has effectively completely deprived CRC of its vested rights.

6 109. The County disputes CRC's contention and intends to prohibit CRC's oil and gas

7 operations by way of the GPU Oil and Gas Policies or the Zoning Amendments.

8 110. A judicial determination of the invalidity of the GPU's Oil and Gas Policies is

9 necessary and appropriate to avoid the deprivation of state and federal constitutional rights that

10 will result from applying the GPU Policies to oil and gas production operations by CRC and the

11 resulting damages.

12 111. A judicial determination of the invalidity of the Zoning Amendments is also

13 necessary and appropriate to avoid the deprivation of state and federal constitutional rights that

14 will result from applying the Zoning Amendments to oil and gas production operations by CRC

15 and the resulting damages.

16 H. Resulting Damagesโข

17 112. CRC is the owner of surface rights and mineral rights in land within the County

18 that will be subject to both the County's GPU Oil and Gas Policies and Zoning Amendments.

19 CRC has fee and leasehold interests in the extraction of oil within the County. For many years

20 prior to the County's actions in drafting, reviewing, and adopting the GPU Oil and Gas Policies

21 and Zoning Amendments, CRC had and continues to have a vested right to continue drilling

22 operations within the County as a matter of right.

23 113. The adoption of the GPU Oil and Gas Policies and Zoning Amendments

24 eliminates substantially all economically viable use of CRC's oil and gas fields within the County

25 for the benefit of the public without prior compensation to CRC.

26 114. The adoption of the GPU Oil and Gas policies also substantially impairs the

27 property rights of CRC in its oil and gas fields within the County for the benefit of the public

- 25 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

without prior compensation to CRC. For example, by prohibiting trucking and flaring and by

2 imposing setbacks that impact its operations, these policies will result in a deprivation of CRC's

3 economically productive use of its mineral interests and vested rights, and they will thereby result

4 a in a taking of CRC's property interests. (See, e.g., Lucas v. S.C. Coastal Council (1992) 505 U.S.

5 1003, 1015-1020.)

6 115. Similarly, requiring a new CUP for continued development under existing permits

7 eliminates the vested interested that existing permits convey on their own to pursue development

8 consistent with the terms of the permit. The GPU and Zoning Amendment restrictions on "new"

9 oil and gas development mean that the expected value of CRC's vested property rights has been

10 eliminated.

11 116. In taking such action, the County violated Article 1, section 19 of the California

12 Constitution, which prohibits the taking or damaging of private property for public use without

13 prior, just compensation. Further, the County violated the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment

14 to the U.S. Constitution, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits the taking

15 of private property for public use without prior, just compensation.

16 117. As a direct result of the County's actions in adopting the GPU Oil and Gas

17 Policies and Zoning Amendments, the County has interfered with the reasonable investment-

18 backed expectations of CRC. Even if these Policies are subsequently invalidated as against CRC,

19 CRC will suffer damages to its property rights as a result of the current implementation of the GPU

20 Oil and Gas Policies. To-date, CRC has not received any compensation from the County on

21 account of the alleged taking of, or damage to, its property rights.

27 119. CEQA requires the lead agency for a project to prepare an EIR that complies with

- 26 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

the requirements of the statute. The lead agency must also provide for public review and

2 comment on the project and associated environmental documentation. An EIR must provide an

3 adequate project description and sufficient environmental analysis such that decision-makers can

4 intelligently consider environmental consequences when acting on the proposed project.

5 120. Defendants committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a

6 manner required by law by certifying and relying on an EIR that fails to meet the requirements of

7 CEQA.

8 121. Inadequate Project Description. CEQA requires that an EJR provide an
accurate, stable, and finite project description. An adequate EIR must be prepared with a

10 sufficient degree of analysis to provide decision-makers with information which enables them to

11 make a decision which intelligently takes account of environmental consequences.

12 122. The EIR fails to provide legally adequate project description. For example, the

13 EIR's project description is impermissibly vague; fails to identify where new land use

14 designations will be applied; fails to identify and describe the policies adopted by the GPU in

15 adequate levels of detail; fails to describe what each new GPU element will actually accomplish;

16 fails to identify what buildout of the plan area would be; and excludes any meaningful

17 description of the implementation measures, actions, and programs necessary to carry out the

18 GPU.

19 123. Failure to Properly Describe the Environmental Setting. An EIR must

20 describe existing environmental conditions in the vicinity of the proposed project, which is

21 referred to as "the environmental setting" for the project. This description of existing

22 environmental conditions normally serves as the "baseline" for measuring the changes to the

23 environment that will result from the project and for determining whether those environmental
24 effects are significant.

25 124. The EIR's description of the environmental setting and baseline is inadequate and

26 inaccuratc, including its description of existing environmental conditions concerning air quality,

27 aesthetics, biological resources, greenhouse gas emissions, energy, geologic hazards, hazards and

- 27 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

hazardous materials, land use, mineral resources, and population and housing.

2 125. The EIR impermissibly buries description of the existing environmental and

3 regulatory setting in the 1,000+ page Background Report appendix, in direct contravention of

4 CEQA's mandate. "[I]nformation 'scattered here and there in EIR appendices,' or a report

5 "buried in an appendix,' is not a substitute for a "good faith, reasoned analysis .. ."" (California

6 Oak Foundation v. City of Santa Clarita (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 1219, 1239, quoting Santa

7 Clarita Organization for Planning v. County of L.A., 106 Cal.App.4th 715, 722, 723.) Even the

8 Background Report appended to the Draft EIR fails to adequately describe existing
environmental and regulatory conditions.

10 126. Moreover, the EIR's description of the environmental setting cannot be any

11 longer than necessary to provide an understanding of the significant effects of the project and the

12 alternatives analyzed in the EIR. (14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง 15125(a).) The description of the

13 environmental setting is over 1,000 pages long and far exceeds what is necessary to understand

14 the project's significant effects.

15 127. Failure to Adequately Analyze and Disclose the GPU's Significant

16 Environmental Impacts and Support Conclusions Regarding Environmental Impacts with

17 Substantial Evidence. CEQA requires that an EIR describe the proposed project's significant

18 environmental effects; each such effect must be revealed and fully analyzed in the EIR. (Pub.

19 Res. Code ยงยง 21100(b), 21002.1; 14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง 15126.2(s).) Significant effect on the

20 environment refers to substantial, or potentially substantial, adversc changes in physical

21 conditions. (Pub. Res. Code ยงยง 21068, 21060.6, 21100(d).) The CEQA Guidelines further

22 require that in discussing the environmental effects of a project, an EIR should contain "a

23 sufficient degree of analysis to provide decisionmakers with information which enables them to

24 make a decision which intelligently takes account of environmental consequences." (14 Cal.

25 Code Regs. ยง 15151.) CEQA requires that substantial evidence in the administrative record

26 support all of the EIR's conclusions.

27 128. Defendants violated CEQA by certifying an EIR that fails to adequately analyze

28
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

and disclose the GPU's environmental impacts and fails to support conclusions regarding

2 environmental impacts with substantial evidence, including but is not limited to:

3 a. Failure to adequately analyze and disclose air quality impacts, especially

4 impacts associated with implementation of the GPU's Oil and Gas Policies. In addition, the EIR

5 fails to analyze or disclose that these policies are preempted by state or federal law, violate existing

6 private property rights, and are infeasible. The EIR fails to adequately analyze and disclose the

7 GPU's air quality impacts associated with favoring imported oil over oil produced in Ventura

8 County, which will deteriorate air quality in the region.

9 b. Failure to adequately analyze and disclose impacts on biological resources,

10 including impacts related to wildlife nursery sites, habitat conservation plans, and natural

11 community conservation plans.

12 C. Failure to adequately analyze and disclose impacts on energy, including

13 failure to qualitatively evaluate whether the GPU will result in inefficient and wasteful energy

14 consumption, and whether the GPU will conflict with state or local plans.

15 d. Failure to adequately analyze and disclose the GPU's impacts on

16 greenhouse gas emissions, especially impacts associated with implementation of the GPU's Oil

17 and Gas Policies. In addition, the EIR fails to analyze or disclose that these policies are preempted

18 by state or federal law, violate existing private property rights, and are infeasible. The EIR fails to
19 acknowledge, calculate, and disclose the increased greenhouse gas emissions that would result from

20 the loss of Ventura County crude development opportunities. The EIR also incorrectly analyzes

21 and calculates greenhouse gas emissions generated by the oil and gas industry, while failing to

22 properly analyze and disclose greenhouse emissions from stationary sources in non-oil and gas

23 industrial sectors, including emissions from paper mills.

24 C. Failure to adequately analyze and disclose the GPU's hazards and

25 hazardous materials impacts. The EIR fails to support with substantial evidence the conclusion

26 that Policies HAZ-5.2, HAZ 5.5, HAZ-5.8, and HAZ 7.1 and County Implementation Programs K

27 and L will reduce impacts to less than significant levels. The EIR fails to analyze or disclose the

- 29 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

- alleged impact of existing trucking of oil and gas products with regard to hazards or hazardous

2 materials. Furthermore, the EIR does not analyze or disclose potential impacts associated with

3 constructing and operating new oil and gas pipelines.

4 f. Failure to adequately analyze and disclose the GPU's impacts on hydrology

5 and water quality, including failure to support its conclusions regarding water quality and

6 overdraft with substantial evidence. The EIR does not analyze or disclose the foreseeable adverse
7 consequences associated with large scale construction, installation, and operation of oil and gas

8 pipelines on hydrology and water quality.

9 g. Failure to adequately disclose and analyze the GPU's impacts to mineral

10 resources, especially impacts associated with implementation of the GPU's Oil and Gas Policies.

11 In addition, the EIR fails to analyze or disclose that these policies are preempted by state or federal

12 law, violate existing private property rights, and are infeasible. Substantial evidence does not
13 support Respondents' conclusion that the GPU's Oil and Gas Policies are justified by a need to

14 protect the environment or human health, for example on the lack of justification for the setbacks

15 imposed between the drilling of new wells and residences.

16 h. Failure to adequately analyze and disclose the GPU's impacts associated
17 with noise and vibration, including failure to support with substantial evidence the conclusion that

18 oil supply facilitics are major industrial sources of noise.

19 โข Failure to adequately analyze and disclose the GPU's impacts associated

20 with population and housing, including by failing to analyze the housing impacts that will result

21 from the setback requirements under Policy COS-7.2.

22 j. Failure to adequately analyze and disclose the GPU's impacts associated

23 with transportation and traffic, including failing to support with substantial evidence the

24 conclusion that the GPU's policy addressing flaring and trucking associated with new discretionary

25 oil and gas wells would result in a potential reduction of vehicle miles traveled ("VMT").

26 k. Failure to adequately analyze and disclose the GPU's secondary impacts

27 caused by the economic impact from implementation of the GPU.

โข 30 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

] 129. Failure to adequately analyze or disclose the GPU's cumulative impacts related

2 to air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, noise, traffic, aesthetics, mineral resources, and

3 biological impacts among others. The County also failed to analyze or disclose the GPU's

4 cumulative impacts by impermissibly piecemealing its analysis in the EIR. The purpose of the

5 cumulative impacts analysis is to avoid considering projects in a vacuum, because failure to

6 consider cumulative harm may risk environmental disaster. Without this analysis, piecemeal

7 approval of several projects with related impacts will lead to severe environmental harm.

8 1. The County has impermissibly piecemealed the GPU from its concurrent

9 Zoning Code text amendments to Article 7, Section 8107-5 of the Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance,

10 and Article 5, Section 8175-5.7 of the Coastal Zoning Ordinance. Those amendments modify

11 permitting requirements for new oil and gas exploration and production operations, and the EIR

12 expressly anticipates those amendments to the Zoning Code. Yet the County has made no effort to

13 include cumulative impacts from the Zoning Code amendments in the EIR. The County's improper

14 piecemealing has deprived the public of its right to informed review of the EIR and GPU.

15 130. Failure to Adopt Feasible Mitigation Measures. An EIR must propose and

16 describe mitigation measures to minimize the significant environmental effects identified in the

17 EIR. The requirement that EIRs identify mitigation measures implements CEQA's policy that

18 agencies adopt feasible measures when approving a project to reduce or avoid its significant

19 environmental effects.

20 131. Defendants failed to adopt feasible mitigation measures to reduce potentially

21 significant environmental effects. For instance, Respondents lack substantial evidence that the

22 mitigation measure PR-1, as applied to the setback restrictions in Policy COS-7.2, mitigation

23 measure PR-2, as applied to Policies COS-7.7, and mitigation measure PR-3, as applied to COS-

24 7.8, could reduce the protection of human health and the environment.

25 132. The EIR fails to mitigate significant impacts to mineral resources, greenhouse gas

26 emissions, and air quality, including impacts associated with implementation of the GPU's Oil

27 and Gas Policies.

โข 31
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

- 133. Adoption of Inadequate and Infeasible Mitigation Measures. An EIR must

2 describe feasible mitigation measures that could minimize the project's significant adverse

3 impacts. Lead agencies must avoid remote, ineffective, and speculative mitigation measures.

4 Moreover, it is ordinarily inappropriate to defer formulation of a mitigation measure to the

5 future. Defendants have adopted inadequate and infeasible mitigation measures.

6 134. The EIR fails to disclose and consider that several mitigation measures are

7 infeasible because they are preempted by federal, state, and/or local law and/or cannot be carried

8 out without unlawfully impairing vested property rights and cannot be enforced.

9 135. Failure to Adequately Respond to Comments. A CEQA lead agency must

10 evaluate comments on environmental issues received from persons who reviewed and

11 commented on the EIR during the public comment period, and the CEQA lead agency must

12

13 prepare written responses to such comments. The written response must describe the disposition
of significant environmental issues raised. When the CEQA lead agency's position is at variance

14 must

15 with recommendations and objections raised in the comments, the responses to comments
address such recommendations and objections in detail, and the responses must explain why

16

17 specific comments and suggestions were not accepted. Conclusory statements unsupported by
factual information will not suffice.

18 136. The public, including CRC, submitted numerous comments to the County

19 throughout the environmental review process. Yet, the County either ignored these comments or

20 glossed over their substance with conclusory responses. For example, the County failed to

21

22 adequately address the public comments regarding: the insufficiency of the Project Description;
issues of preemption; and the infeasibility of various policies, alternatives, mitigation measures,

23 and goals.

24 137. Failure to Recirculate the EIR. CEQA requires that if significant new

25

26 information is added to an EIR after a draft EIR is prepared, but before certification of the final
EIR, an amended EIR must be recirculated for public review and comment.

27 138. Defendants failed to recirculate the Draft EIR despite inclusion of significant new

32 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

2 information in the Final EIR. For example, the County included new oil and gas information,
data, calculations, and analyses. The County also included significant new information

3 regarding the greenhouse gas inventory and forecast.
A 139. Recirculation is further required because the EIR omitted key information

a necessary to determine what the GPU's potentially significant impacts would be.

140. Defendants have also failed to revise the EIR to add missing required information,

cQ address legal deficiencies, and correct false and unsupported impact analyses. Accordingly, the
EIR is fundamentally flawed and must be recirculated.

141.

10 As a result of the foregoing defects and others according to proof, the EIR is

11 legally defective and Defendants have failed to comply with CEQA's procedural requirements.

12 By certifying an EIR that failed to comply with CEQA's mandates, Defendants committed a

13 prejudicial abuse of discretion, failed to proceed in the manner required by law, and acted

14 without substantial evidentiary support. Accordingly, the Court should issue a writ of a mandamus
directing Defendants to set aside certification of the EIR and approval of the GPU.

15 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

16 Violations of CEQA - Improper Use of Categorical Exemption

17 (Public Resources Code ยง 21000, et seq.)

18 142.

19 CRC realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as though
fully set forth herein.

20

21 143. Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in

22 the manner required by law in filing a Notice of Exemption ("NOE") for the NCZO amendments

23 and failing to prepare an initial study and/or environmental impact report to identify, analyze,

24 disclose, and mitigate significant environmental impacts from the NCZO amendments prior to
approving them.

25 144.

26 The NCZO amendments constitute a "project" under CEQA. (Pub. Res. Code
ยง 21065; Guidelines 15378(a).)

27 145. The Board of Supervisors incorrectly determined that the NCZO amendments are

33 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

L categorically exempt from environmental review under CEQA based on the Class 8 Exemption.

2 which applies to "actions taken by regulatory agencies, as authorized by state or local ordinance,

3 to assure the maintenance, restoration, enhancement, or protection of the environment where the

4 regulatory process involves procedures for the protection of the environment."

5 146. The Class 8 exemption does not apply to the NCZO amendments because the

6 Board of Supervisors is a legislative body, not a regulatory agency.

7 147. The Class 8 exemption is also inapplicable because the NCZO amendments will

8 have significant effects on the environment, including impacts to mineral resources and
greenhouse gas emissions. The NCZO amendments will broaden the applicability of the GPU

10 Oil and Gas Policies, which the Final EIR for the GPU found will already have significant and

11 unavoidable effects on the environment. Thus, the Final EIR for the GPU itself provides

12 substantial evidence that the NCZO amendments will have significant effects on the

13 environment.

14 148. At all times relevant herein, Respondents knew or should have known that

15 substantial evidence supported the conclusion that the Class 8 Exemption is inapplicable to the

16 NCZO amendments for the reasons stated herein.

17 149. Under Guidelines section 15300.2(c), "[a] categorical exemption shall not be used

18 for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant

19 effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances." The Class 8 Exemption claimed by

20 Respondents for the NCZO amendments cannot be used under CEQA Guidelines section

21 15300.2(c), because the NCZO amendments present unusual circumstances, and there is a

22 reasonable possibility that a significant environmental impact will result from those unusual

23 circumstances, including impacts to greenhouse gas emissions and mineral resources.

24 150. Further, the Class 8 Exemption claimed by Respondents for the NCZO

25 amendments cannot be used under CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2(b) because NCZO

26 amendments in conjunction with the GPU Oil and Gas Policies will have a cumulatively

27 significant impact on the environment, including on mineral resources and greenhouse gas

โข 34
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 emissions.

2 151. Moreover, since the County has not produced any evidence that the NCZO

3 amendments will have no adverse effect on the environment, the County "cannot say with

4 certainty 'there is no possibility that the activity in question may have a significant effect on the

5 environment.'" (California Unions for Reliable Energy v. Mojave Desert Air Quality

6 Management Dist., (2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1245-1246, citing Dunn-Edwards Corp,

7 supra, 9 Cal.App.4th at p. 658.)

8 152. For the foregoing reasons, the exception provided in CEQA Guidelines sections

9 15300.2(b) and 15300.2(c) applies.

10 153. Respondents have failed to comply with the requirements of CEQA and the

11 CEQA Guidelines prior to approving the NCZO amendments.

12 154. Respondents' actions in adopting the NCZO amendments without full compliance

13 with the requirements of CEQA, as alleged herein, were arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of

14 discretion. Respondents' failure to conduct any CEQA review prior to approving the NCZO

15 amendments further constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion for failure to proceed in a

16 manner required by law. (Pub. Res. Code ยง 21168.5.)

17 155. CRC performed any and all conditions precedent prior to filing this action and has

18 exhausted all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

19 156. As the NCZO amendments are not exempt from CEQA under CEQA Guidelines

20 section 15308, or any other CEQA exemption, the County as the lead agency must prepare an

21 initial study to be followed by the appropriate environmental document. (Guidelines ยง 15063(a);

22 San Lorenzo, supra, 139 Cal.App.4th at p. 1373.) Respondents failed to comply with these legal

23 requirements because the County did not prepare an initial study in connection with its approval

24 of the NCZO amendments or otherwise conduct any environmental review under CEQA prior to

25 its approval of the NCZO amendments.

26 157. For the foregoing reasons, a writ of mandate should issue, commanding

27 Respondents to rescind their action approving the NCZO amendments, until such time as

3 Violation of CEQA - Improper Use of Statutory Exemption

4 (Public Resources Code ยง 21000, et seq.)

5 158. CRC realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as though

6 fully set forth herein.

7 159. Respondents a committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed

8 in the manner required by law in filing a NOE for the CZO amendments and failing to prepare an

9 initial study and/or environmental impact report to identify, analyze, disclose, and mitigate

10 significant environmental impacts from the CZO amendments prior to approving them.

11 160. The CZO amendments constitute a "project" under CEQA. (Pub. Res. Code cn

12 21065; Guidelines ยง 15378(a).)

13 161. The Board of Supervisors incorrectly determined that the CZO amendments are

14 statutorily excmpt from environmental review pursuant to Public Resources Code section

15 21080.9 as an amendment to an LCP.

16 162. The statutory exemption under Public Resources Code section 21080.9 does not

17 apply because the CZO amendments do not constitute amendments to an LCP.

18 163. Respondents' actions in adopting the CZO amendments without full compliance

19 with the requirements of CEQA, as alleged herein, were arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of

20 discretion. Respondents' failure to conduct any CEQA review prior to approving the CZO

21 amendments further constituted a prejudicial abuse of discretion for failure to proceed in a manner

22 required by law. (Pub. Res. Code ยง 21168.5.)

23 164. CRC performed any and all conditions precedent prior to filing this action and

24 has exhausted all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

25 165. As the CZO amendments are not exempt from CEQA under Public Resources

26 Code section 21080.9, or any other CEQA exemption, the County as the lead agency must prepare

27 an initial study to be followed by the appropriate environmental document. (Guidelines 0On

21 On September 15, 2020, the Board of Supervisors certified an EIR for the GPU

22 and approved the GPU. The Draft EIR for the GPU acknowledged that the County was

23 "considering amending its zoning ordinances.ยป$6 But the EIR failed to analyze the significant

24 cumulative effects the Zoning Amendments and GPU Oil and Gas Policies would have on the

25 environment. The EIR failed to conduct this analysis even though the Zoning Amendments were

170. a The County must prepare a further EIR for the GPU because substantial changes

2 have occurred with respect to the circumstances under which the GPU will be undertaken that
will require major revisions to the EIR. This includes substantial changes to the CZO and NCZO
vis a vis the Zoning Amendments, which broaden the scope of the GPU's Oil and Gas Policies

5 and will result in new and more severe significant impacts on the environment that were not

considered in the EIR.

7 171. The County must also prepare a further EIR because new information, which

8 was not known and could not have been known when the EIR was certified, has become available.

9 The significant individual and cumulative environmental effects of the Zoning Amendments were

10 not fully known at the time the County certified the EIR for the GPU because the Zoning

11 Amendments had not yet been adopted at that time. The new information regarding the

12 significant individual and cumulative environmental effects of the Zoning Amendments shows

13 that (1) the GPU will have significant effects not evaluated in the EIR for the GPU and (2)

14 significant effects previously examined in the EIR for the GPU, including significant and

15 unavoidable impacts to mineral resources and greenhouse gas emissions, will be substantially

16 more severe than shown in the EIR.

17 172. The County violated CEQA by unlawfully adopting the Zoning Amendments

18 without first preparing a further EIR for the GPU that adequately addressed the additional

19 environmental effects caused by the Zoning Amendments.

20 173. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law by taking the
21 above-described actions in violation of CEQA. Respondents' actions were not supported by

22 substantial evidence.

4 (Public Resources Code ยง 21000, et seq.)

5 175. CRC realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as though

6 fully set forth herein.

7 176. CEQA requires that a lead agency's findings for the approval of a project be

8 supported by substantial evidence in the record. (14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง 15091.) CEQA further
requires that a lead agency provide an explanation of how evidence in the record supports the

10 conclusions it has reached. As a result of the inadequacies in the environmental analysis

11 identified above, the findings adopted by Defendants are not supported by substantial evidence

12 as required by CEQA.

13 177. Defendants violated CEQA by adopting findings that are inadequate as a matter of

14 law as they are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, including but not limited to

15 the following:

16 a. Findings supporting the GPU's Oil and Gas Policies.

17 b. Findings that recirculation of the Draft EIR was not required.

18 c. Findings that proposed mitigation measures and alternatives to the GPU that would

19 have avoided or lessened the significant impacts of the GPU were infeasible.

20 d. Findings that certain environmental impacts would be less than significant or that

21 adopted mitigation measures would avoid or lessen the GPU's significant effects on

3 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

4 Violation of CEQA -Improper Piecemealing

5 (Public Resources Code ยง 21000, et seq.)

6 180. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as

7 though fully set forth herein.

8 181. Under CEQA, an agency is generally prohibited from "segmenting" or
9 | "piecemealing" a project into separate parts to avoid full disclosure of environmental impacts.

10 182. The Zoning Amendments constitute "projects" under CEQA. (Pub. Res. Code

11 ยง 21065; Guidelines ยง 15378(a).)

12 183. The GPU constitutes a "project" under CEQA. The County analyzed the GPU in

13 an EIR and determined that the GPU would have significant and unavoidable impacts on the

14 environment.

15 184. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion and violated CEQA by

16 unlawfully segmenting the Zoning Amendments from the GPU to avoid CEQA review.

17 185. The "requirements of CEQA cannot be avoided by piecemeal review which results

18 from chopping a large project into many little ones-each with a minimal potential impact on the

19 environment-which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences." (Envl'l Prol. Info. Ctr.

20 V. Calif. Dept. of Forestry & Fire Prot. (2008) 44 Cal.4th 459, 503.)

21 186. Rather, when a lead agency undertakes the environmental review process, the lead

22 agency must review and consider the "whole of the action," (CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15378), and

23 consider "the effects, both individual and collective, of all activities involved in [the] project."

24 (Pub. Resources Code, ยง 21002.1(d).)

26 the Zoning Amendments and GPU together before adopting the Zoning Amendments.

27 188. Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law by taking the above-

described actions in violation of CEQA. Respondents' actions were not supported by substantial

2 evidence.

189. Because CEQA prohibits a disjointed, piecemeal process, a writ of mandate

4 should issue, commanding Respondents to rescind their action approving the Zoning
Amendments, until such time as Respondents have properly complied with the requirements of

6 CEQA.

7 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

8 (Brown Act Violations)
(Govt. Code ยง 54960.1)

10 190. CRC realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as though

11 fully set forth herein.

12 191. Defendant Ventura Board of Supervisors has a public duty to comply with the

13 requirements of the Brown Act and failed to comply with that duty when they failed to properly

14 describe the action to be taken at the September 1, 2020 meeting.

15 192. The Brown Act forbids "serial meetings" in which a series of individual contacts

16 are conducted between Supervisors; these serial meetings deprive the public of an opportunity to

17 participate in transparent and open discussions.

18 193. Supervisors engaged in serial meetings in violation of the Brown Act by

19 discussing agenda items via phone and text while the public session was closed.

20 194. The Brown Act also prohibits requiring registration to attend a public meeting. At

21 the September 1, 2020 meeting no in-person participation was allowed, participants were

22 directed to attend online. However, to participate via Zoom, the public was required to register.

23 195. The Brown Act requires that an agenda be posted at least 72 hours before

24 regular meeting and forbids action on any item not on that agenda. The legislative body may not

25 take any action on an item not appearing on the posted agenda. The purpose of the agenda

26 requirements is to inform the public of proposed action and to encourage public participation in
27 government decision making. On September 1, 2020, during its meeting, the Board of

- 41
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

Supervisors acted to combine its consideration of Item 39 with additional Items 34 and 35. The

2 subject matter of Items 34 and 35 was not introduced prior to the close of public comment on

3 Item 39. The "staff report" to describe these items was held and delivered, not by staff, but by

4 Supervisors Bennett and Parks, after public comment had been closed on the newly combined

5 items. As a result, the public was deprived of an opportunity to comment in any meaningful way

6 on Items 34 and 35.

7 196. CRC and the public were prejudiced by the Board's violations, and they did not

8 receive a full and informed opportunity to participate and comment on the GPU.

9 197. For these reasons, the Board's actions at its September 1, 2020 and continued

10 hearing on September 15, 2020 must be declared null and void.

11 EIGHTH CAUSE OF ACTION

12 (Declaratory Relief for Impairment of Vested Rights - Adoption of the GPU)

13 198. CRC realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as though

14 fully set forth herein.

15 199. CRC seeks a declaration from this Court that CRC has a vested right in the

16 continuation of oil and gas production in Ventura County. CRC further seeks a declaration that,

17 a as a result of this vested right, Ventura County may not prohibit the activities authorized by

18 existing use permits through the GPU.

19 200. The doctrine of vested rights seeks to protect property owners and developers who

20 have substantially relied on past permits and proceeded accordingly with the government's

21 acknowledgement. The doctrine protects permit holder's right not only to construct, but also to

22 use the premises as authorized by the permit. (Cnty. of San Diego v. McClurken (1951) 37

23 Cal.2d 683, 691.)

24 201. CRC has vested rights under the CUPs to the continued development and

25 production of oil and gas in the fields in which it has interests, consistent with long-established

26 plans and CRC's vested rights in the CUPs. Such vested rights prohibit the County from

27 prohibiting activities authorized by the CUPs by adopting the GPU.

42
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

202. CRC's vested rights prevent the County from prohibiting activities authorized by

2 CRC's CUPs on the basis of the policies set forth in the GPU.

3 203. CRC or its predecessors have drilled wells and installed equipment with the

4 expectation that additional wells would be drilled under applicable permits. "The very nature

5 and use of an extractive business contemplates the continuance of such use of the entire parcel of

6 land as a whole, without limitation or restriction to the immediate area excavated at the time the

7 ordinance was passed." (Hansen Brothers Enterprises, Inc. V. Bd. of Supervisors (1996) 12

8 Cal.4th 533, 553.)

204. CRC has a vested right to continue its operations in its Ventura County oilfields,

10 which may not be abridged absent due process and a finding of nuisance or payment of adequate

11 compensation. "The owner of a property right to drill for and extract oil in a proven field

12 acquired under a permit, may not constitutionally be deprived thereof without payment of just

13 compensation except upon showing that its exercise constitutes a nuisance." (Trans-Oceanic

14 Oil Corp., supra, 85 Cal.App.2d at p. 789.) The County has not found that any of the oil and gas

15 production activities on CRC's properties constitute a nuisance. To the contrary, at all times
16 relevant herein, the continued operations and drilling at CRC's properties have occurred

17 lawfully, in compliance with its CUPs, and in a manner that does not create harm or a nuisance

18 to local communities.

19 205. In the alternative, the "diminishing asset doctrine" applies, which permits oil and

20 gas operators and others in extractive industries to exhaust the mineral value of their property.

21 This doctrine was approved by the California Supreme Court in Hansen Brothers Enterprises,

22 Inc. v. Board of Supervisors (1996) 12 Cal.4th 533. There are many years of oil and minerals yet

23 to be extracted from CRC's properties. CRC's reasonable, investment-based expectation was

24 that its lessees would continue to produce and develop oil and gas until CRC's oil and gas

25 producing properties were no longer capable of producing oil and gas in commercial quantities.

26 Defendants' actions will have the direct result of substantially diminishing CRC's reasonable

27 investment-backed expectations.

โข 43 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 206. The GPU Oil and Gas Policies would have the effect not only of shutting down a

2 business that has mutually benefitted the County for decades, but also of terminating the right to

3 produce oil an extraordinarily valuable resource that reduces the need for California to rely on

4 foreign oil resources, which are much more carbon-intensive.

5 207. For example, the setback restrictions pursuant to GPU Policy COS-7.2 (Oil Well

6 Distance Criteria) will exclude large sections of existing oilfields from new wells.

7 208. The restrictions pursuant to GPU Policies COS-7.7 (Conveyance for Oil and

8 Produced Water) and 7.8 (Gas Collection, Use, and Disposal) will further impact CRC's ongoing

9 and future oil operations within the County. Many of CRC's oil fields require the use of trucks

10 to transport either produced water or oil, and the use of flaring to dispose of unneeded gas.

11 209. The combination of the new restrictions in the GPU Oil and Gas Policies will

12 it make it impossible to continue production in many fields currently operated by CRC.

13 210. CRC has clearly exhibited an intent to continue and to complete the development

14 and production of its oil and gas resources within the County. The continued development of

15 these resources is a progression of the extractive activity into all areas of CRC's oil and gas

16 fields as authorized by its permits.

17 211. The County disputes CRC's contention and intends to prohibit CRC's oil and gas

18 operations by way of the GPU.

19 212. CRC seeks a judicial declaration of the rights and obligations of the respective

20 parties.

21 213. Judicial intervention in this dispute, and a declaration by the Court, is necessary to

22 resolve whether CRC has a vested right to continue and to complete the development and

23 production of its oil and gas resources within the County.

24 214. The County's adoption of the GPU Oil and Gas Policies irreparably harms and

25 will continue to irreparably harm CRC based on the substantial economic harm and operational

26 harm that will flow from application of the GPU.

27

FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

1 NINTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Declaratory Relief for Impairment of Vested Rights - Adoption of the Zoning Amendments)

3 215. CRC realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as though

4 fully set forth herein.
5 216. CRC seeks a declaration from this Court that CRC has a vested right in the
6
continuation of oil and gas production in Ventura County. CRC further seeks a declaration that, 7

8 as a result of this vested right, Ventura County may not prohibit the activities authorized by

9 existing use permits through the Zoning Amendments.

10 217. CRC has performed substantial work and incurred substantial liabilities in

11 operating under its existing permits, investing in and installing infrastructure and equipment for
12 the oil-producing properties at issue with the expectation that additional wells could be drilled.
13 218. CRC has also clearly exhibited an intent to continue and to complete the
14

15 development and production of its oil and gas resources within the County. The continued

16 development of these resources is a progression of the extractive activity into all areas of CRC's

17 oil and gas fields as authorized by its permits. (See Hansen Brothers Enterprises, Inc. v. Bd. of

18 Supervisors (1996) 12 Cal.4th 533, 533 ['[t]he very nature and use of an extractive business

19 contemplates the continuance of such use of the entire parcel of land as a whole, without
20 limitation or restriction to the immediate area excavated at the time the ordinance was passed"].)
21 As a result of CRC's operations in implementing the permitted use of drilling for and extraction
22

23 of oil, gas, and other hydrocarbon substances, CRC has acquired a vested a right under these

24 permits to continue the construction authorized by these permits.

25 219. The Zoning Amendments effectively eliminate anticipated future development

26 activities. By altering the definition of what constitutes a discretionary permit, the Board has

27 eliminated the vested rights contained in pre-1960 CUPs.

45
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

- 220.

2 The County is forcing operators to seek additional CUPs where previously the

3 County has recognized the vested rights of existing permits.

4 221. Given the County's historic practice of delaying and rejecting CUPs for new

5 wells, CRC is informed and believes and thereon alleges that the County's actions will have the

6 effect of permanently banning future development previously allowed under existing CUPs held

7 by CRC.

8 222. The County has not shown that continued production and extraction operations

9 under CRC's mineral rights constitute a nuisance.

10 223. The County disputes CRC's contention and intends to prohibit CRC's oil and gas

11 operations by way of the Zoning Amendments.

12 224. CRC seeks a judicial declaration of the rights and obligations of the respective

13 parties.

14 225. Judicial intervention in this dispute, and a declaration by the Court, is necessary to

15 resolve whether CRC has a vested right to continue and to complete the development and

16 production of its oil and gas resources within the County.

17 226. The County's adoption of the Zoning Amendments irreparably harms and will

18 continue to irreparably harm CRC based on the substantial economic harm and operational harm

19 that will flow from application of the Zoning Amendments.

20 TENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

21 (Declaratory Relief Based Upon Violation of Article 1, ยง19 of the California Constitution

22 and Violation of the Takings Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments

23 [Inverse Condemnation])

24 227. CRC realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as though

25 fully set forth herein.

26 228. The GPU Oil and Gas Policies and Zoning Amendments are invalid because they

27 substantially impair CRC's property rights in their oilfields within the County without prior

46 โข
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

compensation to CRC. The County therefore violated Article 1. section 19 of the California

2 Constitution and the Takings Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United

3 States Constitution by adopting the GPU.

4 229. The County's adoption of the GPU Oil and Gas Policies and Zoning Amendments

5 are part of a concerted effort to stop oil and gas production in the County, directly attacking

6 ongoing business interests.

7 230. The County's adoption of the GPU Oil and Gas Policies and Zoning Amendments
co also substantially impairs CRC's property rights in its oil fields within the County for the benefit
9 of the public without prior compensation to CRC.

10 231. The GPU Oil and Gas Policies and Zoning Amendments will force CRC to bear

11 public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.

12 232. In taking such action, the County violated Article 1, section 19 of the California

13 Constitution, which prohibits the temporary or permanent taking or damaging of private property

14 for public use without prior, just compensation. Further, the County violated the takings clause

15 of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment,

16 which prohibits the temporary or permanent taking of private property for public use without

17 prior, just compensation.

18 233. The County disputes CRC's contention and intends to prohibit CRC's oil and gas

19 operations by way of the GPU Oil and Gas Policies and Zoning Amendments.

20 234. A judicial determination of the invalidity of the GPU's Oil and Gas Policies and

21 the Zoning Amendments is necessary and appropriate to avoid the deprivation of state and
federal constitutional rights that will result from applying the Policies to oil and gas production 22

23 operations by CRC and the resulting damages.

ELEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Damages for Taking or Damaging Property for Public Use Without Prior Compensation in

3 Violation of Article 1, ยง19 of the California Constitution and Violation of the Takings Clause

4 of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution)

5 235. CRC realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as though

6 fully set forth herein.

7 236. At the time the County adopted both the GPU Oil and Gas Policies and Zoning

8 Amendments, CRC was the owner of surface rights and mineral rights in land within the County.

9 CRC has fee and leasehold interests in the extraction of oil within the County.

10 237. For many years prior to the County's actions in drafting, reviewing, and adopting

11 the GPU Oil and Gas Policies and Zoning Amendments, CRC had a vested right to continue

12 drilling operations within the County as a matter of right.

13 238. The adoption of both the GPU Oil and Gas Policies and Zoning Amendments

14 eliminates substantially all economically viable use of CRC's oil and gas fields within the

15 County for the benefit of the public without prior compensation to CRC. The adoption of the

16 GPU Oil and Gas policies and Zoning Amendments also substantially impairs the property rights

17 of CRC in its oil and gas fields within the County for the benefit of the public without prior

18 compensation to CRC.

19 239. For example, by prohibiting trucking and flaring and by imposing setbacks that

20 impact its operations, these policies will result in a deprivation of CRC's economically

21 productive use of its mineral interests, and will thereby result in a taking of CRC's property

22 interests. (See, e.g., Lucas y. S.C. Coastal Council (1992) 505 U.S. 1003, 1015-1020.)

23 240. In taking such action, the County violated Article 1, section 19 of the California

24 Constitution, which prohibits the taking or damaging of private property for public use without

25 prior, just compensation. Further, the County violated the Takings Clause of the Fifth

26 Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment, which

27 prohibits the taking of private property for public use without prior, just compensation.

48
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

241. a As a direct result of the County's actions in adopting the GPU Oil and Gas

2 Policies and Zoning Amendments, it is interfering with the reasonable investment-backed

3 expectations of CRC.

4 242. To-date, CRC has not received any compensation from the County on account of

5 the alleged taking of, or damage to, its property rights.

6 243. CRC is entitled to damages and attorneys' fees for the County's constitutional

7 violations under Section 1983 of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1871. (See, Monell v. Dept. of

8 Social Services (1978) 436 U.S. 658.)
TWELFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

10 (Declaratory Relief and Damages for Violation of Article I, Section 7 of the California

11 Constitution and Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution [Due

12 Process])

13 244. CRC realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as though

14 fully set forth herein.

15 245. The adoption of the GPU Oil and Gas Policies and Zoning Amendments was

16 arbitrary and discriminatory, and not reasonably related to any legitimate governmental purpose.

17 The purpose of the GPU Oil and Gas Policies is to prohibit CRC's oil and gas operations in the

18 County, despite successful operation there for decades. For these reasons, the adoption of the

19 GPU Oil and Gas Policies and Zoning Amendments violates CRC's due process rights under

20 Article 1, section 7 of the California Constitution as well as the Due Process Clause of the

21 Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

22 246. The U.S. and California Constitutions guarantee persons equal protection of the

23 law and adequate due process rights which also apply in the land use context.
24 247. Courts have held that where a land use regulation docs not legitimately advance a
25 state interest and instead is arbitrary and capricious, substantive due process claims can be

26 upheld.

27 248. While the stated purpose of the GPU Oil and Gas Policics is "[t]o effectively and

- 49 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

safely manage the exploration, production, and drilling of oil and gas resources in Ventura

2 County," the Policies actually have the effect of imposing requirements and restrictions that

3 indirectly prohibit oil and gas operations in the County, rather than "safely manage" those

4 operations. The Zoning Amendments prevent development authorized under existing permits.

5 249. There is no legitimate interest in prohibiting oil and gas operations in the County.

6 250. There is no legitimate interest in eliminating an industry that is already regulated

7 and permitted by various government entities.

8 251. The GPU Oil and Gas Policies and Zoning Amendments also interfere with

9 CRC's vested rights to continue and to complete the development and production of its oil and

10 gas resources in the County. There are substantive due process requirements that vested rights

11 cannot be terminated or impaired by ordinary police power regulations, and can be revoked or

12 impaired only to serve a "compelling state interest," such as harm, danger or menace to public

13 health and safety or public nuisance, and that the government's interference with the vested right

14 must be narrowly tailored to address the compelling interest and its magnitude. The County has

15 not identified any compelling state interest to justify terminating or impairing CRC's vested

16 rights. Nor is there any.

17 252. Moreover, the GPU Oil and Gas Policies and Zoning Amendments impose

18 impermissible and arbitrary restrictions on oil and gas operators like CRC that are not imposed

19 on similarly situated persons or businesses, including use of public roads. This is precisely the

20 type of unequal treatment that has been found to be in violation of the Constitution's equal

21 protection clause.

22 253. A bona fide and actual controversy exists between CRC and the County in that

23 CRC alleges, and the County denies, that the adoption of both the GPU Policies and the Zoning

24 Amendments violated Article 1, section 7 of the California Constitution and the Due Process

25 Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

26 254. CRC desires a judicial determination of the validity of the GPU Oil and Gas

27 Policies and Zoning Amendments to save itself from the harm caused by the adoption of these

50 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

Policies, which prohibit and/or impair CRC's oil and gas operations within the County. The

2 adoption of the GPU Oil and Gas policies and Zoning Amendments results in substantial
hardship to CRC.

255. CRC is entitled to damages and attorneys' fees for the County's constitutional due
process violations under Section 1983 of the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1871. (See, Monell v.

6 Dept. of Social Services (1978) 436 U.S. 658.)

7 THIRTEENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

8 (Petition for Writ of Traditional Mandamus Under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1085 or

9 Alternatively under Section 1094.5)

10 256. CRC realleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing paragraphs as though

11 fully set forth herein.

12 257. a CRC seeks a writ a traditional mandamus pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

13 Section 1085, or alternatively Section 1094.5. The adoption of the GPU and the Zoning

14 Amendments are preempted because the County is preempted from intruding upon the state's

15 exclusive jurisdiction over certain parts of oil and gas regulations.

16 258. California has adopted numerous statutes and regulations that comprehensively

17 regulate virtually all aspects of oil and gas operations. Oil and gas operations are specifically

18 governed by Division 3 of the Public Resources Code (Pub. Res. Code ยง 3000, et seq.) and its

[9 implementing regulations (14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง 1712, et seq.) By and through this all-

20 encompassing statutory and regulatory scheme, the State of California, through CalGEM, has

21 exclusive jurisdiction over the field of oil and gas operations, methods, and procedures to the

22 exclusion of local legislation.

23 259. The GPU impermissibly attempts to indirectly prohibit or impair oil and gas

24 subsurface operations by imposing restrictive regulations. This includes, but is not limited to,

25 the GPU Oil and Gas Policies and General Plan 6.10 Implementation Program L (*Program L").

26 260. The Zoning Amendments impose additional restrictions on oil and gas

27 development, and together with the GPU effectively halts the industry in Ventura County.

- 51 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

261.

2 The Attorney General has concluded that a conflict arises whenever local
government attempts to "exercise control over subsurface activities," whether "directly or

A indirectly." (59 Ops.Cal.Atty. Gen 461, 478; Desert Turf Club v. Bd. of Supervisors (1956) 141
Cal.App.2d 446, 452.)

262.

a The GPU Oil and Gas Policies, Program L, and the Zoning Amendments are

7 preempted by federal and state law, providing that CalGEM has exclusive jurisdiction to regulate

8 the drilling, operation, maintenance, and abandonment of oil, gas, and geothermal wells, and
attendant facilities. CalGEM further has exclusive jurisdiction to regulate the use of pipelines

10 and the flaring of gas. The GPU Policies and Program L attempt to indirectly prohibit or impair

11 subsurface operations by imposing restrictive regulations, in direct contravention of applicable

law.

12

13 263. Program L requires ongoing County evaluation of potential effects from well

14 stimulation treatment and thermal enhanced oil recovery. Program L is preempted by federal

15 and state law, providing that CalGEM has exclusive jurisdiction to regulate well stimulation

16 treatment and underground injection control. Under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, the

17 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has delegated primacy authority over oil and gas

18 injection wells to the CalGEM Underground Injection Control Program.

19 264. GPU Policy COS-7.2 requires setbacks from well heads to address air toxics

20 produced at the well head. This Policy is preempted, including by AB 2588, which requires a

21 facility-specific evaluation of air toxic risk posed to nearby residents and businesses. AB 2588

22 ensures appropriate distances and control measures to minimize air toxic risks to nearby
residents and businesses.

23 265.

24 GPU Policy COS-7.4 attempts to require evaluations of well stimulation treatment

25 and enhanced oil recovery projects for seismic, groundwater, greenhouse gas emission, and other

26 impacts. This Policy is preempted, including by Senate Bill 4, codified in Pub. Res. Code. ยง

27 3150, et seq. Senate Bill 4 explicitly directs CalGEM to promulgate extensive regulations
governing well stimulation treatments in California.

- 52
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

266. GPU Policy COS-7.5 requires restoration for oil and gas sites. GPU Policy COS-

7.5 is preempted, including by 14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง 1776, which requires well sites to be
returned to as near a natural state as practicable within 60-days of plugging and abandonment of
any oil and gas well. Section 1776 also requires oilfield lease restoration to include the removal

5 of all tanks, above-ground pipelines, debris, and other facilities equipment.

6 267. GPU Policy COS-7.6 indicates that the County "shall evaluate discretionary

7 development to identify any abandoned oil and gas wells on the project site." This Policy is

8 preempted, including by Public Resources Code section 3208.1, which establishes well re-
abandonment responsibility when a previously plugged and abandoned well will be impacted by

10 planned property development or construction activities. Section 3208.1 gives CalGEM the

11 authority to order or permit the re-abandonment of any well where it has reason to question the

12 integrity of the previous abandonment, or if the well is not accessible or visible.

13 268. GPU Policy COS-7.8 attempts to restrict flaring of natural gas on new wells

14 except for emergencies and testing. Policy COS-7.8 is preempted, including by state law that

15 expressly provides for flaring of natural gas (Pub. Res. Code ยงยง 3300, 3500-3503; 17 Cal. Code

16 Regs. ยงยง 95665-95677) as does the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District ("VCAPCD"),

17 such as during emergencies, testing power outages, and maintenance of wells, facilities, and

18 pipelines. This Policy is also preempted by 40 C.F.R. Part 60, Subpart A General Provisions,

19 which regulates flares, including those at oil and gas facilities. Policy COS-7.8 is further

20 preempted by state regulations that cover measurement and reporting of flare emissions. (See,

21 e.g., 40 CFR Part 98 Mandatory Greenhouse Gas Reporting; 17 Cal. Code Regs., Mandatory

22 Greenhouse Gas Reporting).

23 269. By adopting the GPU and Zoning Amendments, the County has acted unlawfully

24 and beyond the scope of its statutory and regulatory authority as set forth in California and

25 fcderal law.

26 270. In adopting the GPU and Zoning Amendments, the Planning Commission and

27 Board of Supervisors also failed to comply with its legal obligations under the Government

- 53 -
FIRST AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS AND COMPLAINT

Code. The Planning Commission failed to conduct an independent review and recommendation

2 of the General Plan, as required by Government Code section 65354. The Board of Supervisors

3 substantially modified the General Plan by adding and modifying policies and mitigation

4 measures that were not previously considered by the Planning Commission, in violation of

5 Government Code section 65356.

6 271. The County has acted arbitrarily and capriciously and has abused its discretion.

7 272. CRC has beneficial interest in ensuring that the County does not enforce the

8 GPU Policies that exceed its authority and are preempted by state and federal statutes. CRC

9 owns or has operating interests in mineral rights for thousands of acres in the County and has an

10 interest in ensuring its right to continue production of oil and gas from its properties, which are

11 impacted by the preempted Oil and Gas Policies.

12 273. CRC is irreparably harmed by the County's adoption of the GPU and Zoning

13 Amendments.

14 274. CRC has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy at law to challenge the GPU and

15 Zoning Amendments other than the relief sought herein. Without the resolution of these

16 challenges, CRC will be permanently and irreparably harmed by implementation of the GPU.

17 275. Because the adoption of the GPU is quasi-legislative in nature and not

18 adjudicatory, CRC brings this action under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. In the

19 alternative, however, CRC also seeks writ of mandamus under Code of Civil Procedure section

20 1094.5 to the extent, if any, that the Court concludes section 1094.5 is applicable here.

2 in the County, and are in direct conflict with superior California law, including, without

3 limitation, the sections of the California Public Resources Code relating to oil and gas

4 production, Senate Bill 4, CalGEM regulations, and permits lawfully issued by CalGEM.

5 278. Defendants lack the power, authority, and jurisdiction to indirectly prohibit or

6 impair subsurface operations by imposing restrictive policies, as that power is exclusively a

7 function of the State of California. Moreover, the laws of the State of California preempt and

8 fully occupy regulation of the fields of drilling of oil and gas wells, well stimulation treatment,
underground injection control, enhanced oil recovery, well abandonment and re-abandonment,

10 flaring, and restoration of oil and gas sites. The provisions of the GPU Oil and Gas Policies,

11 Program L, and Zoning Amendments purporting to regulate, restrict, prohibit, and/or impair

12 subsurface operations are preempted, in whole or in party, by federal and state law, and, as such,
13 are invalid and without effect.

14 279, The Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors failed to comply with their

15 legal obligations under the Government Code. The Planning Commission failed to conduct an

16 independent review and recommendation of the General Plan, as required by Government Code

17 section 65354. The Board of Supervisors substantially modified the General Plan by adding

18 policies that were not previously considered by the Planning Commission, in violation of

19 Government Code section 65356.

20 280. CRC is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that Defendants dispute the

21 contentions set forth above.

22 281. Judicial intervention in these disputes, and a declaration by the Court, is necessary

23 to resolve whether the adoption of the GPU and Zoning Amendments is invalid under the

24 Government Code and whether its Oil and Gas Policies are preempted, in whole or in part, by

25 federal and state law.

26 JURY TRIAL DEMAND

27 CRC requests a jury trial as to all causes of action for which one is permitted.

Re: Notice of Intent to Commence Action Against Ventura County and the Ventura County

Dear Ms. Gonzalez:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code ยง 21167.5, that Petitioner and
Plaintiff, California Resources Corporation, will file suit against Defendants and Respondents,
County of Ventura and Ventura County Board of Supervisors. Petitioner is amending the
pleading it filed in California Resources Corporation v. County of Ventura et al. (Ventura County Superior Court Case No. 56-2020-00546189-CU-WM-VTA, filed on October 15, 2020), which
stated claims regarding the Board's adoption of the Ventura County 2040 General Plan Update,
including claims for violations of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). The
amended pleading states additional claims and allegations regarding the County's failure to observe the requirements of CEQA in the administrative process that culminated in the County's
November 10, 2020 decision to adopt amendments to the Ventura County CoastalZoning
Ordinance ("CZO")and Non-Coastal Zoning Ordinance ("NCZO") (collectively, "Zoning
Amendments") without first complying with CEQA.

The relief that California Resources intends toseek with the Petition for Writ of
Mandate and Complaint includes, but is not limited to, the following:

For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate, commanding the County:

O To vacate and set aside approval of the Zoning Amendments;

RE: September 15, 2020 Agenda Item No. 41, as continued from September 1, 2020 Agenda Item Nos. 34, 35 & 39, and Agenda Items Nos. 35 and 42

Honorable Members of the Board:
The earlier procedural and substantive defects that have marked the General Plan
Update and Final ElR process were compounded at and following the September 1, 2020 Ventura County Board of Supervisors ("BOS") meeting. On behalf of California Resources Corporation, we submit this letter to demand that the BOS cure or correct the serious Brown Act violations from Items 34, 35 and 39 that undermined the validity of the September 1, 2020 meeting. In addition to the Brown Act violations, the public process in this matter continues to be severely compromised. We highlight the newest
defects below.

1. The Board of Supervisors Violated the Brown Act.

The requirements of the Brown Act apply to the Board of Supervisors meeting held on September 1, 2020. (Gov. Code, ยง 54952.) The Brown Act requires an agenda to be available at least 72 hours prior to a meeting. This agenda must include a brief general description of each item of business. (Gov. Code, ยง 54954.2.) The public must have the opportunity to understand and comment upon the items up for deliberation in order to effectively discuss those items with the Board. (Gov. Code, ยง 54954.3.)
As is clear from the 967 comments on a wide a range of issues that were submitted in association with Item 39, and the number of individuals that were unavailable for comment due either to technical difficulties or to the significant delay, the citizens of Ventura County were not given adequate opportunity to comment. The many aspects of the General Plan Update and the Final EIR will greatly impact the citizens of Ventura. Any attempt to diminish the public's ability to effectively participate in the discussion on
this issue cannot be tolerated.

Chair Kelly Long and Members of the Ventura County Board of Supervisors
September 14, 2020
Page 2

A. The Board of Supervisors May Not Engage in Non-Public
Deliberations regarding the Adoption of the General Plan Update.
Under the Brown Act, "[a]ll meetings of the legislative body of local agency shall be open and public." (Gov. Code, ยง 54953.) The purpose of the Brown Act is to ensure that local government conducts the public's business openly, so that the public may be well informed. (ld., ยง 54950.) Board of Supervisors Chair Kelly Long reiterated this critical element of public meetings during the meeting stating that: "it is very important that we have transparency and public input" during the process.
However, during a break in the public session, Supervisor Bennett could clearly be heard discussing the content of the General Plan Update. Supervisor Bennett is heard saying: "Hey John, real quick while we're on this break..uh, yeah... if that's the case we have to go back to the planning ... so this proposal of 2,500 up from 1,500 ..." before the
audio feed was interrupted. The private conversation followed a proposal under agenda a Item 39 to increase the currently proposed oil and gas set back of 1,500 feet to 2,500 feet,
raised during public comments.
This discussion, apparently conducted between Supervisor Bennett and Supervisor Zaragoza, was clearly intended to be kept from the public, as Supervisor Bennett noted just after the public session resumed that he had just been told his mute button was not working and proceeded to test it. This private conversation is a concerning sign that non-public deliberations were occurring behind closed doors, and raises
unacceptable risks regarding compliance with the Brown Act.

In response to a Public Records Act request, the County has also recently produced text messages between Supervisor Bennett and Supervisor Parks discussing the revision of maps included in the General Plan. (See Attachment.) Thus, it appears that a majority of the Supervisors have been having private discussions concerning Item 39 during the time that it was directly before the Board for deliberation.
The Brown Act prohibits "serial mectings" in which a series of individual contacts are conducted between Supervisors. "A majority of the members of a legislative body shall not use a series of communications of any kind, directly or through intermediaries, to discuss, deliberate, or take action on any item of business that is within the subject matter jurisdiction of the legislative body." (Gov. Code, ยง 54952.2(b)(1).) Individual conversations cannot be used to accomplish in stages what would be prohibited in one step. These serial meetings deprive the public of an opportunity to participate in transparent and open discussions; they result in the kind of secret
deliberations that the Brown Act is designed to prevent.
B. The Public Was Improperly Required to Register for the Meeting.

The Brown Act also prohibits requiring registration to attend a public meeting. No
in-person participation is available, the agenda notes that the building is closed to the

LEGAL02/40050727v6

Chair Kelly Long and Members of the Ventura County Board of Supervisors September 14, 2020
Page

public, and notes that participants should attend online. However, none of the provided options for submitting comments are sufficient. The agenda notes that to comment via Zoom, a participant is required to register. Comments made while watching the livestream are only read at the "discretion of the chair" and thus this is not an adequate substitute for full and open participation. The agenda does not provide the necessary
clarity required by the Brown Act that registration cannot be required to attend a public
meeting.

A member of the public shall not be required, as a condition to attendance at a meeting of a legislative body of a local agency, to register his or her name, to
provide other information, to complete a questionnaire, or otherwise to fulfill any condition precedent to his or her attendance.
If an attendance list, register, questionnaire, or other similar document is posted at or near the entrance to the room where the meeting is to be held, or is circulated to the persons present during the meeting, it shall state clearly that the signing, registering, or completion of the document is voluntary, and that all persons may attend the meeting regardless of whether a person signs, registers, or completes
the document.

(Gov. Code, ยง 54953.3.) The Board of Supervisors did not adequately comply with this
requirement to allow public participation in the current pandemic.

2. The Addition of Agenda Items 34 and 35, and Combining Them with
Item 39, Precluded Planning Commission and Informed Public
Comment.

On September 1, 2020, during its meeting, the Board of Supervisors acted to combine its consideration of Item 39, a hotly contested and debated General Plan Update which encompassed a large range of topics, with additional Items 34 and 35. However, Items 34 and 35 proposed further additions to the General Plan Update, which were never heard by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission has a statutory obligation
to make an independent review of the proposed general plan in making a written
recommendation to the Board of Supervisors. Section 65354 of the Government Code
provides that "[t]he planning commission shall make a written recommendation on the
adoption or amendment of a general plan." (Govt. Code ยง 65354; see also Govt. Code ยง 65103.) These items, introduced at the September 1, 2020 meeting, alter the Gencral Plan but have not been reviewed by the Planning Commission.
Further, the subject matter of Items 34 and 35 was not introduced prior to the
close of public comment on Item 39. The "staff report" to describe these items was held
and delivered, not by staff, but by Supervisors Bennett and Parks, after public comment had been closed on the newly combined items. As a result, the public was deprived of an
opportunity to comment in any meaningful way on Items 34 and 35. The public didn't
know the County or Board's intention regarding these two added items.

LEGAL02/40050727v6

Chair Kelly Long and Members of the Ventura County Board of Supervisors
September 14, 2020
Page 4

3. The Creation of the Climate Emergency Council Occurred without
Public Input.

Throughout the General Plan Update process, mitigation measure GHG-4 has
called for the creation of a Climate Emergency Council ("CEC"), which will have
significant input into the County's work toward meeting its Climate Action Plan goals and obligations. However, without notice to the participating public, after the close of public comment on September 1, 2020, this measure was surprisingly and materially rewritten by the BOS during the hearing. It was not rewritten in general terms as would
be common to a broad policy document like General Plan Update, but with the specifics of membership that would be typical of an implementing resolution following weeks or months of staff consideration. Because this wholesale change took place after the close of
the public comment period, the public was again deprived of any input. The Board is now seeking to extend its denial of process on this item, which is slated for separate consideration on September 15, 2020 as agenda item 35, in advance of the very creation of the CEC and the adoption of the EIR (agenda item 41) that support and justify it. The hurried timeline for appointment of the CEC members, which is the subject of item 35, can only be understood as another Board strategy for depriving the public of meaningful input into the General Plan Update, EIR and CEC-creation process.

4. None of the Revised General Plan Update and EIR Documents are
Redlined, Disabling Informed Public Participation.
At its hearing on September 1, 2020, the Board conducted a tentative vote to approve the General Plan Update and Final EIR, subject to: (a) a significant number of revisions which were, at best, generally and confusingly described to the public at the September 1, 2020 meeting; and (b) the Board's return to review and vote on the final documents, as revised, on its continued hearing of this matter on September 15, 2020. Late at night on Thursday, September 10, 2020, the revised documents were first made available to the public. The newly published documents, consisting of 24 new exhibits, include thousands of pages. None of the revisions to these pages are identified for the public. It is unreasonable and irresponsible for the Board to require the public to comb
through these pages to find the changes, and to assume that this exercise of great importance could be accomplished by the public in the two working days that have been allotted to them. At this time, the public has simply been left behind and does not know what the Board is proposing to enact.

5. Outreach to the Spanish-Speaking Community Has Not Complied
with the State Mandate.

Furthermore, despite the fact that over 40% of Ventura County identifies as Latino, neither the General Plan Update, nor the Final EIR has been made available in Spanish. Not even the Executive Summary or key excerpts have been provided in Spanish. This is contrary to the State's requirement that "[a]ll communication should be done in the major languages spoken in the community. This includes any advertising and

LEGALO2/40050727v6

Chair Kelly Long and Members of the Ventura County Board of Supervisors
September 14, 2020
Page

written background materials as well as live interpretation at key public events. Some documents, such as the draft general plan or the draft environmental impact report, may be infeasible to translate in their entirety. In such cases, the planning agency should consider translating an executive summary into the major languages spoken in the
community." (California General Plan Guidelines, p. 32.) The County's continued assertion that it need not provide any General Plan materials in Spanish does not conform to these Guidelines.

This lack of outreach to the Spanish-speaking community, which may be disproportionately affected by the economic realities of the General Plan Update, has been an ongoing issue during the General Plan process. At the time of its September 1, 2020 hearing, the Board belatedly instructed staff to bring back cost figures to its September 15 hearing so that the General Plan Update could be translated into Spanish after-the-fact of its adoption into law. Unfortunately, even this effort has since been questioned. A new, separate item 42 has now been added to the September 15 agenda, apparently asking the Board whether it would like to rethink its translation instruction.
What is most apparent is the manner in which the BOS agenda has been manipulated for two successive Board hearings, to separate, introduce and reevaluate matters pertinent to
the General Plan Update, all disabling public participation.
The General Plan EIR drew significant public participation, and the public deserves to hear their elected officials discuss the issue in full. The backroom
conversations, the failure to adequately inform the public of opportunities to participate in the Commission hearing virtually, and the failure to make participation equally available to all members of the County community is unacceptable. The County has 30 days to take corrective action under Government Code Section 54960.1. CRC requests that Item 39 be reopened and a new hearing conducted. Further, the members of the Board of Supervisors must clarify to the public the exact nature of all non-public conversations between the Supervisors regarding Item 39.
Please notify CRC of any intent to cure the defects identified above prior to the running of the 30-day period.

Sincerely,
tt Ledueluolor
