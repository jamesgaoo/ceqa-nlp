13 MANDATE
V.

15 Respondent.
16 ETX, LLC dba El Toro Land and Cattle
17 Company,

18 Real Party in Interest

19

20 Heber Public Utility District alleges:

21 1. Petitioner Heber Public Utility District is a Special District organized and

22 operating under the laws of the State of California, which provides water, sewer, solid

23 waste, and parks services in and around the project, and whose constituents and rate

24 payers are affected by project approval.

25 2. Respondent, County of Imperial, is the responsible agency that made the
26 decision being challenged.

27 3. Real Party in interest, ETX, LLC, doing business as El Toro Land and Cattle

28 Company, is the applicant, property owner and developer of the project.

4. The project is located in the unincorporated area of Imperial County, near the
2 townsite of Heber, and consists of a multi-phased expansion that would double the size of
an existing 82 acre, 17,000 head cattle feed lot ("Project"). Respondent is the lead agency
responsible under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) for evaluating the

5 environmental impacts of the project.

6 5. Petitioner is informed and believes that while the environmental impacts of
ã 7 the proposed project were circulated for public comment, a full environmental review was
81:GG:ZL 8 not performed and members of the public, including Petitioner, were hindered or prevented

9 from commenting or attending public meetings regarding the project due to Covid-19 stay

d 10
Imperial Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery peuwugns 09-14-2020 at home orders issued by Respondent.

11 6. By Resolution dated August 11, 2020, Respondent approved the
12 | requested zone change for Zone Change # 18-006 and expansion of the existing feed lot

13 and adopted a Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND"). A Notice of Determination to carry
14 out the project was filed by Respondent on August 13, 2020.
15 7. Petitioner, other agencies, interest groups, and individuals made oral and
16 written comments on the proposed projects and raised the legal deficiencies asserted in
17 this Petition. Petitioner further asserts that Respondent failed to consider the written

18 comments submitted by it to Imperial County Planning and Development Services on

19 March 19, 2020.

20 8. Petition has performed all conditions precedent to filing this action by

21 complying with the requirements of the Public Resources Code §21167.5 and filing notice

22 of this action on September 11, 2020.

23 9. Petitioner is informed and believes that Real Party in Interest are preparing
24 to proceed with the construction and operation of the Project in the near future. Said
25 construction and operation will irreparably harm the environment in that a Mitigated
26| Negative Declaration does not adequately address the health and safety risks for air

27 quality, greenhouse gas emissions, noise, and transportation. A temporary restraining
28 order and permanent injunction should issue restraining Real Party in Interest from

I • proceeding with the Project.

2 10. Respondents actions in approving and certifying the Mitigated Negative

3 Declaration and adopted findings constitute a prejudicial use of discretion in that

4 Respondent failed to proceed in the manner required by law and its decision is not

5 supported by substantial evidence as follows:

6 A. Due to Respondents Covid-19 stay at home orders, the Petitioner and
ã the public at large were prevented and hindered from any meaningful
8799:ZL public comment or discussion prior to Project approval in violation of
§ 9 State open meeting laws.
* Imperial Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery submitted 09-14-2020: 10 B. The Mitigated Negative Declaration fails to thoroughly evaluate or

11 analyze the Projects significant impacts on air quality, greenhouse
12 gas emissions, noise impacts, transportation impacts, and other

13 significant environmental impacts on the Heber Community.

14 C. The Mitigated Negative Declaration fails to describe and evaluate

15 reasonable mitigation measures that could eliminate or substantially

16 lessen significant environmental and other impacts described herein.

17 D. The Project description is incomplete and misleading in that it fails to

18 acknowledge the probable increase in environmental impacts
19 associated with increased emissions from feedlot expansion,

20 including composting on and off site, expansion in the number of

21 cattle at the feed lot, noise and traffic circulation, and health issues for

22 people living in and around the Project. By failing to follow the CEQA

23 requirement that Respondent assess the Project as a whole, it

24 effectively chops the Project into smaller pieces and ignores the

25 cumulative consequences of Respondents actions on the

26 environment.

27 E Respondents approval of the Mitigated Negative Declaration fails to

28 respond adequately to comments on the Project, and fails to consider

3

1 at all Petitioners comments 'to Imperial County Planning and

2 Development Services of March 19, 2020.

3 F. Respondents approval of the Project ignores a "No Growth" condition

4 contained in a 2007 zone change for the feedlot, and fails to assess

5 the environmental and health impacts of so doing.

6 11. Respondent thereby violated its duties to Petitioner and the public at large
ã by determining that the Project will not have a significant impact on the environment, which
81:99:ZL is contrary to the requirements of CEQA. Accordingly, Petitioner requests that
Respondents action to approve the Project via a Mitigated Negative Declaration must be
* Imperial Superior Court Accepted through eDelivery pen!wqns 09-14-2020 10 set aside.

11 Wherefore, Petitioner demands entry of judgment as follows:

12 1. For a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction restraining real

13 party in interest ETX, LLC, doing business as El Toro Land and Cattle
14 Company, from taking any action to carry out the Project pending trial.
15 2. For a peremptory right of mandate correcting:
16 a. Respondent to vacate and set aside its Project approval and findings

17 and orders made with respect to the Mitigated Negative Declaration

18 and Resolution approving Zone Change #18-006 made on or about
19 August 11, 2020,

20 b. Respondent and Real Party in Interest to suspend all activity under

21 the Project approval that could result in any change or alterization in

22 the physical environment, including in and around the townsite of

23 Heber, until Respondent has taken actions that may be necessary to

24 bring the approval of the Project into compliance fo CEQA.

25 C. Respondent to prepare, circulate and consider a new and legally

26 adequate Environmental Impact Review and otherwise to comply with

27 CEQA in any subsequent action taken to approve the Project.

28 3. For its cost of suit.

•* '

1 4. For an order of attorneys fees.

2 5, For other equitable or legal relief that the Court considers just and proper.

Alternative Dispute Resolution Information
NOTICE: In all general civil cases, plaintiff and cross-complaints are required to serve this form on each defendant or new party to the action.
Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) may help resolve disputes without trial. ADR is usually less expensive, less formal and less time consuming than a trial. ADR can also be less adversarial and may provide parties with the opportunity for more creative and/or flexible outcomes than can be achieved in trial. Since various ADR methods may or may not be appropriate in any particular case, it is advisable to consult with an attorney about options available.
Mediation
An impartial person called a "mediator" helps the parties try to reach mutually agreeable resolution of the dispute. The outcome is decided only by the parties, If the parties do not reach an agreement, the mediator does not make any decisions or recommendations to the court. Mediation is useful when the parties have a relationship they wish to preserve. Mediation may not be as useful if one of the parties is unwilling to
compromise, or if one party has significant power over the other. The only court sponsored mediation service available in the Superior Court is for child custody and visitation.

Arbitration
An impartial person called an "arbitrator" listens to evidence and argument from both sides and then decides the outcome. Arbitration is less a formal than a trial, and the rules of evidence may be relaxed. Pursuant to Imperial Superior Court Local Rules, Division 5 - Arbitration, Rule 3.5.0, all non-exempt unlimited civil cases where the
amount in controversy does not exceed $50,000 as to any plaintiff, and all limited civil cases shall be submitted to arbitration under CCP 1141.10 et seq.

Settlement Conference The parties and their attorneys meet with a judicial officer to discuss possible settlement of the dispute. The judicial officer assists the parties in evaluating the strengths and weaknesses of the case, but does not make any decision. Settlement conferences are scheduled upon request of the parties and order of the judge assigned to the case.

Additional Information
For information on Superior Court of California, County of Imperial's arbitration process see the Local Rules at www.imperial.courts.ca.gov and Stipulation to Use of Alternative Dispute Resolution Process, Local Form GN-02.
