SUMMARY OF FACTS 3

4 15. The proposed project is located on the southeast corner of Yosemite Avenue and
McKee Road, west of Lake Road and the newly completed Campus Parkway. It is 5

6 approximately 2.2 miles south of the entrance to the University of California, Merced, located al

"] E Lake Road and Bellevue Road. It is approximately 5.94 acres in size.
si Adoo-e sIu i 8 16. Prior to the acquisition of the subject site by the Real Party in Interest (RPI),

9 Merced Holdings, LP (MHLP"), in 2012, the parcels were zoned Low Density Residential (LD)

10 and had two older (dilapidated) residential structures on the site.

11 17. In 2014, the RPI applied for a re-zone of the property to Neighborhood

12 Commercial (CN). Mr. Steed and other residents participated in the hearing process. Due to
13 the fact that the distance to the nearest commercial shopping center G Street and West Yosemite

14 Avenue is approximately 1.25 miles west of the propose project site, Mr. Steed and the other

15 residents of the noarby neighborhoods compromised and supported the rezoning, which included

16 environmental review without an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) having been prepared or

17 certified.

18 18. In July of 2019, MHLP applied for a Gencral Plan Amendment #19-02, Zone

19 Change #426, and Conditional Usc Permit #1231 for a mixed-use development on the subject

20 property, The zone change would change 22,670 square fect of the southernmost parcel from

21 Low Density Residential (R-1-6) to Neighborhood Commercial (CN). The CUP for the total site

22 would, would allow for the consiruction of 428 efficiency use onc-bedroom apartments and

23 18,000 square fect of retail commercial use in four 3-story buildings on the 5.94-acre project sito.

24 19. The City held n hearing before the Planning Commission on August 21, 2019, at

25 which Petitioner Steed and other members of the community appeared and opposed the project,

26 which the Planning Commission denied. Included with the City Staff Report for the Planning

27 Commission meeting was document provided by the R.PI, entitled "University Village at

28 Yosemite," bearing a replica of the official Seal of the City of Merced. Mr. Steed appcared and

6

DJooal unoo IEIOILIO (GCb815U) ww objected to the use of the City Scal and informed the Planning Commission that it was a violation

2 of the Merced City Code for the Applicant to use the City Seal without the City's approval.

3 20. Just prior to the hearing, there was an encounter between Mr. Steed and the

4. Applicant's representatives, in the presence of City Staff member Julie Nelson, when Mr. Steed

5 informed the Applicant's representatives, Mr. Englanoff and Raj Joshi, that their use of the City

6 Seal violated the City Code. 1Merced Code of Ordinances, Chapter 1.08|

7 21, g RPI filed its appeal of the Planning Commission decision and action approving
v2 8 Kdoo-e siut the application and adopting the Environmental Determination. On October 7, 2019, the RPI's

9 sappeal was heard and denied by the City Council. The Findings, Decision, and Action of the

10 Planning Commission were upheld by the Council; and the application for the project was denied

11 without prejudice.

12 22. In October, 2019, the RPI submitted a new application for the proposed project

13 which is being challenged by Petitioners and Plaintiffs in this action, described hercin as "The

14 Hub at Yoscmite." The revised application for the proposed project requests approval of

15 Conditional Use Permit #1238, Site Plan Review #455, and Environmental Review #19-37

16 (Mitigated Negative Declaration).

17 23. The application for CUP #1238 is for a mixed-use development located on the

18 same 5.94-acre site. It requests approval of 214 apartment units (with 366 bedrooms) and
19 approximately 37,117 square feet of commercial space (retail and office). These uses would be

20 contained within four separate buildings on the site. Buiklings 1 and 3 would be 2-story

21 buildings, and Buildings 2 and4 would be 3-story buildings. Building 1 would contain residential

22 units on both floors of the building. Buildings 2 and 4 would have a combination of retail space

23 and common area for the residents. Building 3 would have office ases on the first floor and

24 residential units on the second floor. The revised project would provide a total of 127, 206

25 square feet of residential living space, 12,544 square fect of space for the residential tenants,
26 12,255 square feet of office space, and 22,672 square fect of retail commercial space. The

27 residential units would include one, two, and three bedroom units. The development would have

28 82 - 1 bedroom/lbath units; 112 - 2 bcdroom/2 bath units; and 20 - 3 bedroom/3 bath units.

7

SIu I e-copy is tne omicial court recora (GC0815U) -

2 (366 bedrooms) The one bedroom units would vary in size depending on whether the unit

3 includes a balcony. A one bedroom unit with a balcony would have 276 square fcet and without

4 a balcony, it would have 300 square feet. The two-bedroom units would be 576 square feet with

5 a 24-square-foot balcony, and the thrce bedroom units would be 876 square feet with a 24-

6 square-foot balcony. [Staff Report dated Jan. 22, 2020)

has been in negotiations with UC Merced and has received a Letter of Intent (LOI) from the UC

9 indicating their intent to continue negotiations for a program to house UCM graduate students,

10

11 post doctorate students, and visiting faculty (Attachment G). They are considering negotiations
for 8 master lease for some portion of the residential units and office space.' [Staff Report,
January 22, 2020, p. 2]

12 25.

13 The hcaring of the application before the Planning Commission was set for

14

15 January 22, 2020, Petitioners and Plaintiffs and other members of the public appeared before the
Planning Commission and made objections to the approval of the application based on adverse

16

17 environmental impacts of the project and density based on inconsistencies with the City Gencral
Plan and Zoning Ordinance and other objections. The Planning Commission approved the

18 application for CUP #1238 and Environmental Detcrmination #19-37. (Site Plan Review #455

19 was not before the Planning Commission.)
26,

20

21 On or about January 29, 2020, Mr. Steed timely filed an appeal of the Planning
Commission's decision and action, based on numcrous adverse environmental impacts and

22 inconsistencies with the City General Flan and Zoning Ordinance and other issues.
27.

23

24 After Mr. Steed's appeal was filed with the City Cleck, the Planning Department

25 Staff determined that the City had failed to notice or includo the approval of Site Plan Review

26 #455 at the January 22., 2020 hcaring of CUP #1238, and noticed a hearing of only the Site Plan
Review #455 before the Planning Commission on March 18, 2020, in violation of the Merced

27 City Code of Zoning Ordinances.
28.

28 On March 16, 2020, Petitioners' legal counsel sent a letter to the Mayor objecting
to the hearing set before the Planning Commission on March 18, 2020 and demanding that the

8

SIU I e-copy is tne omciai court recora (UC0815U) 1

2 hearing on the Site Plan Review #455 must be heard at a new hearing of the CUP #1238. The

3 Planning Commission did not hear either matter on March 18, 2020 and it was noticed for April
13, 2020, without including CUP #1238.

4 29,

5 On April 13,2020, Petitioners submitted objections to the Site Plan Review #455

6 and appeared at the hearing on that date by telephone, due 10 the Covid19 restrictions on personal

7 appearances at public hearings in the City of Merced. Petitioners made their objections on the

8 record; however, the Planning Commission granted the application for the Sitc Plan Review and
adopted Environmental Determination #19-37.

9 30.

10 On April 20, 2020, Petitioners' lcgal counscl filed an appeal of the Planning

l1 Commission's approval of Site Plan Review #455 with the City Clerk.
31.

12 On April 29, 2020, Petitioners' legal counsel filed an Amended Appeal and

13 written objections to the approvals of CUP #1238 and Site Plan Revicw #455, which appeals

14 were both set on May 4, 2020 before the City Council.
32.

15 On May 4, 2020, the uppeal of both CUP #1238 and Site Plan Review #455 was

16 continued to June 15, 2020 at the request of Applicant's and Petitioners' legal counsel.
33.

17 On Junc 15, 2020, based on the correspondence of Applicant's attorney and

18 Petitioner'legal counsel, the City Council agreed to re-commence the hearing of the appeals on

19 both CUP #1238 and Site Plan Review #455 and the environmental review until August 17,
2020.

20 34.

21 On August 17, 2020, the appeals were heard and a Resolution of Inteut to deny

22 the appcals and to approve CUP #1238, and Site Plan Review #455 was approved, with

23 modifications proposed by Council members McLeod and Serratto, and Environmental

24 Determination #20-05 was certified by a vote of 4-2 (Council members McLeod, Martinez,
Serratto, and Shelton:

25 Aye; Mayor Murphy and Council member Echeverria, Nay). Council

26 member Kevin Blake had recused himsell from hearing the matter.
35.

27 During the hearing of the matter, there was substantial colloquy ("negotiations")

28 being conducted on the record between the Council members and the legal counsel for the
Applicant. After the closing statements had been heard from counsel for the parties, Mayor

9

(ncugann) diodej unoo leIlo eu si Ádoo-i 42 i nis 1 Murphy closed the public hearing and brought the matter back to the Council for deliberation;

2 however, when counsel for the Applicant asked the Mayor to rC-open the hearing and to be heard
3 further regarding additional discussion on the matter, the Mayor exercised the prerogative of the

4 Chair and denied the request for further colloquy.
5 36. Following this exchange between Applicant's attorney and the Mayor, during the

6 deliberations of the Council, Council member McLeod signaled to the City Attorncy that she had

7 something to say and the City Attorney indicated that Council member McLeod might have a

8 "clarification" to share with the Council, at which time Councilmember McLeod indicated that

9 the Applicant had just contacted and wanted her to share additional information with the Council.

10 As the meeting continued, Mayor Murphy withdrew from the deliberations and deferred to

11 Council member Scrratto, who appeared to be coordinating support a ro-negotiated modification

12 of the number of apartment units down from 214 to 200 in order to reach a consensus of the

13 Council members, which was facilitated by Councilmember Serratto, without input from the

14 Mayor, which produced the Resolution of Intent of the Council, which included referral of the
I5 drafting of the wording by Devclopment Director, Scott McBride to be brought back to the

16 Council at the Council meeting of September 21, 2020 for a hearing on the Findings and final

17 Resolution.

18 37. On September 11, 2020, due to the strange conduct exhibited by Council member

19 McLeod at the August 17, 2020 mecting, counsel for the Petitioners made a Public Records Act
20 request through the City Clerk requesting cellphone texts and other messages between the four

21 Council members who voted for the Resolution of Intent and the Applicant's representalives for

22 the time period of August 11 through August 18, 2020.
3 8 38. On September 21, 2020, based on the review of the Video recording of the August;
17, 2020 Council hearing for the cntitlements that are the subject of this action, counsel for the
Petitioners requested thet all council members disclose their ex parte communications and 25
26 requested that all Council members who had communications with the Applicant's
27 representatives after the close of the public hearing and during the deliberations of this matter on
28 August 17, 2020 to recuse themseives from the vote on the final Resolution before the Council.

10

(ncl9ans) puopei unoo IBI9IlIo eui si Ádoo-e siu l S2 ned No Council member recused himself or herself. Petitioners' legal counsel also objected to the

2 Applicant's representative (Joseph Englanoff) having interference with, contamination of, and

3 corruption of the hearing process by violating the Petitioners' and the public's right to a fair

4 hearing. The City Council took testimony and argument from the attorneys for the parties and

5 adopted Resolution No. 2020-63 on a 4-2 vote of the same four Council members who had voted

6 for the Resolution of Intent on August 17, 2020.

7 39. On September 22, the Notice of Determination certifying the Environmental
8 Detormination # 20-05 was filed with the County Clerk.

0 40. On September 28, 2020, the City provided its response to the Public Records Act

10 request sent to the City Clerk on September 11, 2020. Included in the responses were

11 screenshots of text messages on the cellphones of Council members McLcod and Serratto before
12 the meeting and during the deliberations on the subject entitlements sought by the RPI while they

13 were on the dais. These communications involved instructions from Joseph Engelhoff aka

14 Englanoff regarding instructions as to what to offer as further Conditions of Approval that the
15 Applicant wanted the Council members to put before the Council and urging the Council

16 members to get the matter resolved during the public meeting on August 17, 2020.
17 41. On October 19, 2020, Petitioners transmitted their Notice of Intent to File Suit

6 that was disputed by opposing expert witnesses, regarding the following.

7 A. Adverse impacts to traffic sufely and traffic congestion, which were not adequately

8 disclosed, analyzed, discussed or mitigated, caused by turning movements at the project's access

O and egress points on Yosemite Avenue and McKee Road during peak a.m. and peak p.In. time

10 periods, resulting from incoming and outgoing traffic thai were not adequately disclosed and

11 evaluated in the K2 Traffic Engineering, luc. Study or its amended study submitted in response to

12 Pelitioners' expert's report. The Supplemental Report by K2 did not adequately address the

13 cumulative impacts on internal circulation resulting from incoming traffic from vehicles coming

14 on-site for work at the offices and the retail stores proposed for the proposed project. [Appendix

15 D and Supplemental Report]

16 B. Adverse impacts caused by electric power outages on the proposed pump-storage

17 cquipment required for the retention and disposition of untreated effluent, due to the limited
18 discharge capacity of the Yosemite Avenue scwer system, which may require diesel pumps

19 during emergency shut-downs, and for which there is no back-up storage facility on site, in the

20 event of such emergency overflows. The resulting uncontrolled overflow would cause significant

21 effecis to public health and safety by being discharged into the street or into the Merced Irrigation
22 District canal on the east side of the project site or unto the neighboring property to the south of

23 the project site.

24 C. Failure to proceed in the manner required by law, based on the fact that the lead
25 ageney has not required the Applicant to prepore the Parking Management Plan referred to in the
26 record prior to the ndoption of the Envirommental Determination nor did the Mitigated Negative
27 Declaration require specific quantification or other substantive elements to be included in the

28 Parking Management Plan which should have been prepared and included in the Mitigated

12

(ncLeqnn) bJodeJ unoo IBIOILIO Negative Declaration, and not deferred to after the approval of the proposed project, because this
to review and comment on the 2 omission violates the public's right to a meaningful opportunity

3 proposed Environmental Determination (Mitigated Negative Declaration). CEQA Guidelines

4 Section 15201.

5 D. Environmental Determination #20-05 failed to disclose the substantial change in the

6 background environmental setting, due to the Covid19 pandemic and quarantine, which has

7 g caused a significant reduction in the number of college students who have to reside in Merced to

si Ádoo-e sIUI 8 attend classes at the University of California, Merced, and Merced Community College. This is

9 substantial defect in the Environmental Determination, because the Applicant has represented

10 that the demand for student housing for UC Merced students is a primary consideration in the

11 rationale supporting the Council's exercise of its discretion to allowing the HD density and small

12 sizes of the apartment units. [See, Resolution 2020-63, Exhibit A, p. 14, para. I "Neighborhood

13 Impact/Interface," RPI's representative Raj Joshi's representations.] However, since UCM has

14 substantially changed its policy on remote distance lcarning (as has Merced Community

15 College), CEQA Guidelines section 15162 is no longer applicable, because of the substantial

16 change in the background environmental seting, which requires an updated Environmental

17 Determination to be prepared, because of the change in the project environmental sciting, which

18 could potential result in a significant change in the number of tenants who will not cone to UC

19 Merced and/or Merced Community College.

20 45. Wherefore, Petitioners scek this Court's issuance of a writ of mandate commanding,

21 directing, and ordering the Merced City Council to vacate and set aside its decision and action

22 adopting and certifying Environmental Determination #20-05 (Mitigated Negative Declaration),

23 based in its abuse of discretion by failing to proceed in the manner required by law, pursuant to

24 Pub. Res, Code sections 21168 and 21168.5, and directing the City to prepare a legally adequate

25 environmental review document that complies with CEQA.

inis e-copy Ine orficial court recora (GC6815U) 46.

2 Petitioners re-allege and incorporate herein by reference each and every allegation
contained in paragraphs 1 through 45, inclusive, as though fully sct forth herein.
47,

4 City Staff has advised the City Council that the proposed project is consistent with

5 the City General Plan and the Zoning Ordinance, based on Staff's opinion that the Council can

6 properly exercise its discretion to infer that the HD residential zoning can be superimposed on a

7 Neighborhood Commercial zoned parcel, pursuant to MCC section 20.10.020, thereby

92 8 substantially increasing the density of development on the 5.94-acre project site.
48,

9 Petitioners submitted written opposition to this interpretation of the MCC and the

10 City General Plan, In addition, Mayor Murphy, who is a licensed attorney, objected on the record

11 to the "stacking" of multi-family housing units in a Neighborhood Commercial zone. Similarly,

12 former Council member, Michael Belluomini, who is professional planner with over 30 years

13 of experience working as a professional planner, concurred with Mayor Murphy's opinion and

14 set forth his analysis in writing in the record on several occasions. Also, Mr. Belluomi disagreed

15 with Staff's opinion and recommendation based on his participation in the preparation of the

16 2012 Merced General Plan Update and the Zoning Ordinance implementing the General Plan. In

17 his writfen comments, he stated that the Council's legislative intent did not support Staff's
analysis.

18 49

19 In the case at bar, Staff's recommendation relies upon its interpretation of the

20 Conditional Use Permit section of the MCC that allows the Council to exercise its discretion
under the CUP ordinance to modify

21 project approvals on appcal. However, the City's CUP

22 ordinance does not authorize the Council to abuse its discretion by overriding both the General

23 Plan and the Zoning Ordinance provisions under the circumstances of this application. Here, the

24 Applicant seeks to avoid either a rezoning or compliance with the Planned Unit Development

25 section of the Zoning Ordinance, either of which would have provided a proper alternative to the
CUP solution elected by the Applicant and Staff.
26

27 49, Petitioners concur with Mayor Murphy and Mr. Belluomini, and based their

28 objections to Staff's interpretation and recommendation on the lack of express language in both
the City General Plan and the City Zoning Ordinance to support it. Unlike the General Plan,
14

I nis e-copy iS tne oricial court recora (GC06150) 2

2 which has more flexibility in interpretation by the Council, the Zoning Ordinance should he

3 narrowly construed and intorpreted in the absence of express language authorizing specific uses
or densities.

4 50.

5 Similarly, with respect to design regulations, the Council abused its discretion in

6 the instant case for the rcasons sct forth in Mr. Belluomini's opinion and comments; Petitioners

7 contend they constitutc cxpert testimony and substantial credible evidence given his background

8 and expericnce as a former-two term Council member, and supports Petitioners' claim alleged
herein.

9 51.

10 Petitioners contend that the City Council abused its discretion by failing to

11 consider the facts and analysis provided by Mr. Belluomini which were not addressed nor

12 rebutted in the Findings adopted by the City Council its September 21, 2020, which further

13 demonstrated that the City Council's bias and prejudice caused by the improper communications

14 with Council members at the August 17, 2020 meeting.
52. Wherefore, Petitioners seck this Court's issuance of a writ of mandate
15 commanding, directing, and ordering the Merced City Council to vacate aud set aside its decision

16

17 and action regarding the granting of CUP #1238 and the Site Plan based on the City Council's

18 manifest abuse of discretion to the prejudice of the Petitioners and other members of the general
public.

19

20 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

21 53. [Failure to Comply with Site Plan Review Proccss}

22 Petitioners re-allege and incorporate herein by reference each and every allegation

23 contained in paragraphs through 52, inclusive, as though fully set forth herein.
54.

24 Petitioners submitted written objections to the City's failure to require the

25 Applicant to identify and disclose the location of the underground pump-storage site and the

26 storm water detention site on the Site Plan and presented oral testimony on these objections on

27 the record. Further, Petitioners' experienced licensed civil engincer, John T. Ennis

28 testified on the record that the Site Plan Review must disclose the location of such substantial
infrastructure facilities on the Site Plan.

15

c2 inis e-copy is tne oriciai court recora (GC6815U) 55.

2 Resolution 2020-63 addresses this issue in the Findings, Exhbit A, p. 9, paragraph

3 E) Sewer. This section refers to Conditions #9 and #10 and identifies the location of the

4 proposed onsite storage tank and refers to the adverse effect of potential emission of

5 objectionable odors. It. states "This condition also requires a monitoring system to allow the City

6 to monitor the flow and requires the developer to ensure the onsite storage tank doesn't emit

7 objectionable odors. Petitioners submitted numerous objections to the inadequate specificity
and enforcement measures in Conditions 9 and 10.

8 56.

9 The location of the proposed underground storage tanks and pumping equipment

10 ft the southeast corner of the project is just north of the existing residential neighborhood in the

11 adjacent Moraga development. With the prevailing winds coming from the northwest, any

12 "objectionable odors" .--from elther normal operations or sewage overflows resulting from

13 equipment failure--- if they were to occur would directly impact the neighbors to the immediate

14 west. In addition, any overflows caused by system failure would be discharged into the Merced

15 Trrigation District ditch, which flows southward next to the west side of the Moraga residential

16 development and the cast side of the residential parcels along McKee Road.
57.

17 Therefore, the location of this critical infrastructure was erroncously excluded

18 from the Site Plan Review #455 map, which constitutes material non-compliance with the City's
Site Plan Review Ordinance.

19 58. Wherefore, Petitioners seck this Court's issuance of a writ of mandate
20  commanding, directing, and ordering the Merced City Council to vacate and set aside its decision
21

22 and action approving the Site Plau Review #455, based on its abuse of discretion by failing to
proceed in the manner required by law.
23

24 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

25 59, [General Plan Inconsistency]

26 Petitioners re-allege and incorporate herein by reference each and every allegation

27 contained in paragraphs I through 58, inclusive, as though fully sct forth herein.
60.

28 In addition to previous objections to the inadequacy of Conditions #9 an #I0,
regarding the underground sewage storage system, Petitioners and other members of the public

16

omcial court recora (GUb815U) *

2

3 objected on the record that the underground sewage detention and pump storage facility could be

4 not approved due to the fuct that the Mitigation Measure which purports to address any potential

5 adverse impacts from this system requires that the system must comply with the City's Master
Sewer Plan.

61.

6

g *7 Petitioners objected to this Mitigation Measure on the ground that the City has not

12
inis e-copy 8 adopted a Master Sewer Plan; therefore, the City could not make a such a finding, due to the fact
that the City General Plan does not include such plan.

62.

10 Wherefore, Petitioners seek this Court's issuance of a writ of mandate
9 commanding, directing, and ordering the Merced City Council to vacate and set aside its decisionl

11

12 and action to approve the proposed project, based in its abuse of discretion by failing to proceed

13 in the manner required by law, pursuant to both Government Code section 65300 and Pub. Res.
Code sections 21168 and 21 168.5.

14 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

15

16 [Declaratory Relief - Violation of Due Process]

63. (Code of Civil Proccdure Scction 1060)

17

18 64. Plaintiffs re-allege and incorporate herein by reference each and every allegation

19 contained in paragraphs through 62, inclusive, as though fully set forth herein,

20 Plaintiffs allcge that a dispute and controversy has arisem between the parties

21 concerning the respective rights of the Plaintiffs and the general public and the duties of the

22 Respondent, regarding the conduct of the hearing procecdings and the unlawful conduct of

23 Council members during the August 17, 2020 and Seplember 21, 2020 mcetings.
65.

24 Plaintiffs contend that the City Council members had a duty to comply with the

25 Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and Article 1, section 7, of
the California Constitution.

66.

26

27 Plaintiffs contend that the secret communications of RPI's representative, Joseph

28 Englanoff nka Engelhoff, with Council members Matthew Serratto and Jill McLeod during the
August 17, 2020 meeting and at other times prior to and during the deliberations of the members
of the City Council violated the constitutional and statutory rights of Plaintiffs and the other

17

oiicial court recora (GCb615U) 2 members of the gencral by interfering with, contaminating, and corrupting the public bearing

proccss

3 for the project review of the proposed project.
67.

4 This conduct was particularly reprehensible because it occurred during the time

5 of the Covid19 virus pandemic, which has resulted in creating conditions whereby the Plaintiffs

6 and the gencral public has been disadvantaged in their ability to observe and otherwise detect

& 7 such clandestine and nefarious conduct, duc to the fact that the Council was meeting remotely by

92 nis e-copy 8 clectronic communications and were not on the dais in the Council Chambers, and each of the
Council members were appcaring from remote locations where the Plaintiffs and the general
9 public could not see their actions, such as texting and/or emailing with the RPI's representative.
10 68.

11 Pursuant to a the response of to Plaintiffs' Public Records Act request provided by

12 the City Clerk, Plaintiffs have copies of the texts between Council members McLcod and

13 Serratto which support these allegations and must rely on discovery in this action to obtain

14 additional information, facts, and evidence regarding similar conduct by the other two Council

15 members who supported and voted for the project challenged herein; to-wit: Anthony Martinez
and Delray Shelton.

16 69. Plaintiffs' counsel attempied to redress this violation of Plaintiff's and the
17 public's rights at the September 21, 2020 Council meeting, and none of the Council members

I8

19 who voted for the project disclosed these facts or recused themselves from participation in the

20 deliberations and final votc for the project challenged herein, but had not received the City's

21 response to the PRA request referred hereinabove.
70.

22 The issues raised hercin, regarding the violation of the constitutional rights of the

23 Plaintiffs and the gencral public, are ripe for adjudication; this dispute and controversy involves

24 an issuc of continuing importance to the public interest with respect to their contidence in thein

elected pubic officials and the integrity of the public decision making authority delegated to the
25 publicly elected officials.

26 71,

27 Furthermore, this issue has a direct and immediate relationship to the issues to be

28 contested by the Plaintiffs and Defendants and may have significant importance to other
members of the public if it is not heard, determined, and adjudicated by this Honorable Court.
