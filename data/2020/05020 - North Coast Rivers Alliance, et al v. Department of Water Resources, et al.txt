Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint

51 05599654 VOLKER LAW OFFICES PAGE 06/32
04/28/2020 11:46

1 (collentively "Couservation Groups") hereby petition the Court for a writ of mandate against dofendant
2 and respondent Department of Water Resources ("DWR") and by this Verified Petition for Writ of
Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Reliof and for Attorney's Fees ("Verified

4 Petition") hereby allege as follows:

5 INTRODUCTION

6 1. This is a public interest citizen suit to enforce the California Environmental Quality Act

7 ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code ("PRC') section 21000 et seg., the Delta Reform Act ("DRA"),

8 Water Code section 85000, et seq., and the Public Trust Doctrine. Petitioners bring this action to

9 challenge DWR's March 27, 2020, Cettification of the Final Environmental Impact Report ("FEIR") for
10 the Long Term Operation of the California State Water Project ("Project"), and Project approval. To
11 taking these actions DWR. violated CEQA, the Delta Reform Act, and the Public Trust Docttine,

12 2. ig CBQA is Califotnia's preeminent environmental law. It requires all public ageucies to
13 examine the potential adverse impacts of their actions before taking them. It is designed to protect
14 Califomnia's extraordinary environmental resources from uninformed and needlessly destructive agency

15 actions.

16 3. CEQA requires DWR to fully examine the impacts of its actions and to carefully consider
17  alternatives that would reduce those impacts. Contrary to CEQA, DWR's FEIR does ueither.

18 4. The Project, as approved, is intended to allow DWR to operate the State Water Project
19 ("SWP**) under an incidental take permit ("TIP*) issued by the California Department of Fish and
20 Wildlife ("CDFW) pursuant to the California. Endangered Species Act ("CESA"). Yet DWR failed to

21 present a stable project description, adequately examine the environmental impacts of the Project,
22 consult with impacted tribes, and comply with other applicable state laws intended to protect the

23 environment.

24 5. The Delta Reform Act requires agencies' covered actions to be consistent with the Delta

25 Stawardship Council's Delta Plan and with the coequal goals of the Deita Reform Act. Yet DWR failed
26 to make the required consistency findings before approving the Project.
27 6, The Public Trust Doctrine mandates that DWR consider public trust resources, including
28 fisheries, and act to protect those resources by all feasible means. Contrary to that mandato, DWR failed

04/28/2020 11:45 51 05599654 VOLKER LAW OFFICES PAGE 07/32

1 to adequately consider and protect these rosources in issuing the Project approvals.
2 VENUE AND JURISDICTION
7. This Court has jurisdiction over this proceeding pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure
4 ( ("CCP"*) sectious 526 (injunctive relief), 1060 (declaratory relicf), and 1085 (traditional mandamus);
PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5 (mandamus review); and article VI, section 10 of the California

6 Constitution.

7 8. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to CCP sections 393 (actions against public officers),
8 395 (actions gencrally), and 401(1) (actions against statc agenoy in aby county where Attorney General

ç has office) because the Attorney General maintains an office in the City and County of San Francisco.
10 Conservation Groups were unabie to file a verified petiton and complaint in Sacramento, where DWR'S
11 offices are located, as the Sacramento County Superior Court has declared holiday due to the ongoing
12 public health pandemic and is not currently accepting case-initiating documents in cases arising under
13 CEQA.

14 9. Pursuant to CCP section 388, petitioners are serving the Califomia Attorney General with a
15 copy of this verified petition and complaint. Consistent with PRC section 21167.5, petitioners timely
16 served DWR with potice of this suit. Although not required by PRC section 21167.6.5, petitioners have

17 also named the Bureau of Reclamation (the "Bureau") as a real party in interest. and are timely serving
18 this verified petition and complaint on the Bureau. The Burcau is neither a necessary party under Code
19 of Civil Procedure section 389(a) nor an indispensable party under Code of Civil Procedure section

20 389(b).

21 PARTIES

22 10. Petitioner NORTH COAST RIVERS ALLIANCE ("North Coast Rivers') is non-profit
23 unincorporated association with members throughout Northein California. North Coast Rivers was

24 formed for the purpose of protecting California's rivers and their watersheds from the adverse effccts of
25 excessive water diversions, ill-planned urban development, harmful resource extraction, pollution, and
26 other fonns of environmental degradation. Its members use and enjoy California's rivers and watersheds
27 for recreational, aesthetic, scientifio study, and related non-consumptive uses. The interests of North
28 Coast Rivers and its members have been, arc being, and unless the relief requested hercin is granted, will

VOLKER LAW OFFICES PAGE 08/32

1 be adversely affected and injured by DWR's certification of its inadequate FEIR and approval of the
2 Project.

3 11. Petitioner INSTITUTE FOR FISHERIES RESOURCES ("IFR") is a non-profit, tax-exempt
organization that works to protect and restore salmon and other fish populations and the communities

5 that depend. on them. IFR maintains its principal place of business in San Francisco, California. IFR

0 both funds and manages many fish habitat protection programs and initiatives. In that capacity, IFR
7 seeks reforms to protect fish health and habitat throughout the West Coast of the United States and has

8 successfully advocated for dam removals, improved pesticide controls, better forestry stream protection.

9 standards, and enhauced marine and watershed conservation regulations throughout the West Coast. IFR

10 has worked tirelessly for years to restore and enhance the Delta and its beleaguered fish and wildlife.

11 IFR and its members will be directly and indirectly injured by DWR's Project approval and its failure to
12 adequately protect and restore the imperiled fisheries of the Delta.

13 12. Petitioner PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATIONS

14 ("PCFFA") is a nouprofit membership organization incorporated in 1976 with headquarters located in

15 Sau Francisco, Califomia. PCFFA is composed of more than 14 separate commercial fishing and vessel

16 owners' associations situated along the West Coast of the United States. By virtue of its combined
17 membership of approximately 750 fishermen and women, PCFFA is the single largest commercial
18 fishing advocacy organization on the West Coast. PCFFA represents the majority of California's
19 organized commercial salmon fishermen and has been an active advocate for the protection of Pacific

20 salmon and their spawning, rcaring and migratory babitat for more than 30 years. PCFFA and its

21 members would be hanned by the proposed Project because it would threaten their commercial fishing

22 livelihoods, which depend on sustainable management of the salmonid fisheries resources of the Delta
23 and its associated ecosystems.

24 13. Petitioner SAN FRANCISCO CRAB BOAT OWNERS ASSOCIATION ("San Francisco
25 Fishermen") is a century-old association of owners and operators of small, family owned fishing boats
26 that catch Dungeness crab, wild California King salmon, Pacific herting, and other species that live in
27 and depend upon the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean, and San Francisco Bay-Delta and the Sacramento
28 and San Joaquin Rivers and their tributaries. San. Francisco Fishermen is also actively involved in

Vorifled Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaini - 4-

04/28/2020 11:46 5105599654 VOLKER LAW OFFICES PAGE 09/32

1 community education and advocacy concerning fisheries resoutces legislation to ensure that the rich
2 heritage of commercial fishing in the Bay Area will survive for future generations. San Francisco
3 Fishermen and its members will be harmned by the DWR's Project approval because it would threaten
4 their continued historic use and enjoyment of the fisherics resources of the Delta and its connected

ecosystems.

6 14. Petitioner WINNEMEM WINTU TRIBE is a Native American Tribe whose aboriginal
territory encompasses the upper watersheds of the Sacramento River including the McCloud River. The
8 Winnemem Wintu Tribe was traditionalty dependent on salmon fishing for both subsistence and cultural

9 purposes, and maintains a deep cultural, spiritual and recreational interest in the continued viability of
10 California's salmon runs that pass through the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta (*'Delta"). The
11 Winnemem Wintu Tribe is a strong proponent of Delta restoration, and will be harmed by the reduced

12 Delta fresh water flows, degradation of water quality, destruction of fish and wildlife species, and other
13  environmmental harns that implementation of the Project will allow.

14 15. Respondent and defendant CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES

15 ("DWR"*) is a California public agency established by the Legislature and charged with management of
16 the State Water Project and other water management tasks. Its certification of the FEIR on March 27,
17 2020, and approval of the Project, was subject to and violated the requirements of CEQA, the Delta
18 Reformn Act, and the Public Trust Doctrine. DWR is the lead agency under CEQA for environmental
19 review of the Profect.
20 16. The true names and capacities of respondents DOES 1-20, inclusive, are unknown to
21 petitioners who therefore sue such respondents by fictitious names pursuant to CCP section 474.
22 Petitioners are informed and believe, and based on such information and belief allege, that the
23 fictitiously named respondents are state or local officials or agencies who are responsible, in whole or in
24 part, for the approval and implementation of the Project. Petitioners will, with leave of Court if
25 necessary, amend this Verified Petition if and when the true names and capacities of said Doe
26  respondents have been ascertained.
27 17. Real party in interest UNITED STATES BUREAU OF RECLAMATION ("Bureau") is a
28 federal agency that operates the CVP. The Bureau and DWR coordinate their operation of the CVP. and

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint - 5-

51 05599654 VOLKER LAW OFFICES PAGE 10/32
04/28/2020 11:46

thus the Bureau may receive a benefit from DWR's approval of the Project.
18. DWR did not identify any real parties in interest in its Notice of Determination pursuant to
PRC section 21167.6.5(a), and petitioners are not otherwise aware that afty specific real partios in
4 interest exist, However, out of an abundance of caution and without conceding that its participation is
necessary, petitioners have identified the Bureau AS a potential real party in interest. The true names and

6 capacities of real parties in interest DOES 21-200, inclusive, are unknown to petitioners who therefore

7 sue such real parties in interest by fictitious names pursuant to CCP section 474. Petitioners arc
8 informed and believe, and based on such information and belief allege, that the fictitiously natned real
9 paxtics in interest have a direct interest in approval of the Project. Petitioners will, with leave of Court if
10 necessary, amend this Verified Petition if and when the true names and capacities of said Doe reul parties
11 in interest have been ascertained.

12 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

13 19. Petitioners have authorized their attorneys to file this lawsuit on their behalf to vindicate

14 their substantial beneficial interest in securing DWR's compliance with the law.

15 20. Petitioners have performed auy and all conditions precedent to the filing of this Verified
16 Petition and Complaint and have exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent
17  required by law.

18 21. Petitioners have no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law within
19 the meaning of CCP section 1086 in that, unless this Court issues its writ of mandate setting aside

20 DWR'$ Certification of the FEIR, and approval of the Project, and ordexing it to comply with the laws

21 whose violation is alleged herein, the eaviroumental interests of petitioners and the public that are

22 protected by those laws will be substantially and irreparably harmed. No monetary damages or other
23 legal remedy could adequately compensate petitioners for the harm to their beneficial interests, and to the
24 eavironment, occasioned by DWR's unlawful conduct,

25 22.. Petitioners are entitled to declaratory relief under CCP section 1060 because an actual
26 controversy exists between petitioners and DWR. Petitioners contend that DWR has acted in violation

27 of applicable laws and must therefore vacate and set aside its approval of the Project. Petitiouers are

28 informed and believe that DWR disputes this contention. A judicial resolution of this controversy ís

Verified Petition for Wtit of Mandate & Complaint - 6-

04/28/2020 11:46 5105599654 VOLKER LAW OFFICES PAGE 11/32

1 thereforc necessary and appropriate.

2 23. Petitioners are also entitled to injunctive rellef under CCP section 526 because approval of
3 the Project threatens irreparable environmental harm. Unless enjoined, DWR will implement the Project

4 despite its lack of compliance with applicable laws, causing undue and unnecessary environmentsl

5 degradation. Petitioners would thereby suffer inreparable harm due to DWR's failure to take the required

6 steps to adequately protect the envdronment. Injunctive relief is thus warranted under CCP section 525 et
7 seq. and PRC section 21168.9 to prevent irreparable harm to the environment.

8 LEGAL BACKGROUND
CEQA

10 24. CBQA is California's primary statutory mandate for environmental protection. It applies to
11 all state and local agencies, and requires themn to "first identify the [significant] environmental effects of
12 projccts, and then to mitigate those adverse effects through the imposition of feasible mitigation
13 measures or through the selection. of feasible alternatives." Sierra Club v. State Board of Forestry

14 (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1215, 1233. Its most important substantive imperative requires "public agencies to

15 deny approval of a project with significant adverse effects when feasible altematives or feasible
16 mitigation measures can gubstantially lessen such effects." Sierra Chib v. Gilroy City Council (1990)

17 222 Cal.App.3d 30, 41,

18 25. CEQA's mandate for detailed environmental review "ensures that members of the
19 | [governmental decision-making body] will fully consider the infoumation necessary to render decisions
20 that intelligently take into account the environmental consequences" of their proposed action. Mountain
21 Lion Foundation v. Fish and Game Commission (1997) 16 Cal. 4th 105, 133; PRC §g 21080.5(d)(2)(D),
22 21091(d)(2); 14 C.C.R. [CEQA Guidelines] ("Guidelines") § 15088. The CEQA process thus "protects
23 not only the environment but also informed self-government." Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Board of
24 Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553, 564.

25 26. All California "publio agencies" must comply with CEQA wheu they approve discretionary
26 projects. PRC § 21080(a). DWR is a "public agency" and a "state agency" as a dofined in CEQA. PRC §
27 21063. Therefore, DWR's discretionary approvals are subject to CEQA.
28 27. A proposed govermental action requires environmental review under CEQA if (1) the

Vorifed Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint - 7-

04/28/2020 11:46 5105599654 VOLKER LAW OFFICES PAGE 12/32

agency is contemplating an "approval" of an action as defined by Guidelines section 15352, (2) the
2 l subject matter of the contemplated approval constitutes a "project" under PRC section 21065 and
Guidelines section 15378(a), and (3) the project to be approved does not fall within a statutory

5 exemption created by the Legislature under PRC section 21080(b) and recognized under Guidelines

6 sections 15260-15285, or 8 categorical exemption in the Guidelines as promulgated by the California
Resources Agency pursuant to PRC section 21084(a) and Guidelines sections 15061(b)(2), 15300-15333
and 15354.

Co

9 28. The lead agency must prepare an environmental impact report ("EIR") if it determines that a

10 project may have significant adverse environmental impacts. The EIR must analyze those offects and
suggest feasible means, if any, of mitigating or avoiding them including alternatives that would achieve
11 most of the basic objectives of the project without causing significant envirommental effects. PRC §§
12 21002, 21002.1, 21061; Guidelines §8 15080-15096, 15120-15132,-15160-15170.

13 29. CEQA requires the lead agency to provide a clear description of the Project under
14 consideration. "An accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua

15 HOn of an informative
and legally sufficient EIR." County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 193;
16 Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa, Inc. v. 3and District Agricultural Association (1986) 42 Cal.3d 929,
17 938; Washoe Meadows Community v. Depariment of Parks & Recreation (2017) 17 Cal.App.5th 277,
18 287.

19

20 30. The EIR. must include "[a] statement of the objectives sought by the proposed project.. . .

21 The statement of objectives should include the underlying purpose of the project and may discusg the

22 project benefits." Guidelines § 15124(b), "[A] lead agoncy may not give a project's purposc an

23 artificially narrow definition."* North Coast Rivers Alliance v. Kawamura (2015) 243 Cal.App.4th 647,

24 668 (quoting In re Bay--Delta (2008) 43 Cal.4th 1143, 1166). The agency's formulation of its underlying
purpose and objectives is essential to its consideration of altematives, Id. An agency need not study
25  alternatives that cannot satisfy the Project's basic goal. Id.
26 31. In applying these CBQA procedures, an agency may not segment a project to avoid
27 prepering an EIR on, the entirety, or whole, of the project. Guldelines § 15378(a), (c), (d). CEQA'S
28 "requirements cannot be avoided by chopping up proposed projects into bite-size pieces which,

Vorified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint . 8 -

individually considered, might be found to have no significant effect on the enviromuent or to be only
2 ministerial." Plan for Arcadia, Inc. V, City Council of Arcadia (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 712, 726.
3 32. In order to comply with CEQA "an EIR must be performed before a project is approved, for
4  "if postapproval environmental review were allowed, EIR's would likely become nothing more than post

5 hoc rationalizations to support action alrcady taken." Save Tara V. City of West Hollywood (2008) 45

6 Cal.4th 116, 130, bracket omitted, quoting Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. v. Regents of University of

7 California (1988) 47 Cal.3d 276, 394),

8 33. For every CEQA project that had "a notice of preparation or a notice of negative declaration

9 or mitigated negative declaration filed on or after July 1, 2015" - such as this Project - the lead agency is

10 required to consult with California Indian Tribes. Stats. 2014, ch. 532 (A.B. 52), § 11(o), eff. Jan 1,
11 2015); PRC § 21080.3.1. For the purposes of CEQA, section 21080.3.1(b) incorporates the definition of

12 "consultation" found in Government Code section 65352.4. Thas, DWR was tequired to undertake

13 [a] xcaningful and timely process of sceking, discussing, and considering carefully the views of others, in a manner that is cognizant of all parties' cultural values and, where 14 feasible, seeking agrecment, Consultation between government agencies and Native

15 American tribes shall be conducted in a way that is mutually respectful of each party's sovereignty. Consultation shall also recognize the tribes' potential needs for confidentiality with respect to places that have traditional tribal cultural significance. 16

17 Government Code 65352.4, emphasis added.

23 The Delta Reform Act

24 35. To address the indisputably perllous state of the Delta, in 2009 the California Legislature

25 erlacted the Delta Rcform Act, declaring that "It]he Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed and

26 California's water infrastructure are in crisis and existing Delta policies are not sustainable." Water

27 Code § 85001(a), cmphasis added. The Legislature found that *44the Delta' is a critically important
natural resource for Califomnia and the nation. 28 It serves Califotnians concurrently as both the hub of the

California water systern and the most valuable estuary and wetland ecosystem on the west coast of North
2 and South America." Water Code 5 85002. "Resolving the crisis requires fundamental reorganization

3 of the state's management of Delta. watershed resources." § Water Codc § 85001(a), emphasis added.

4 Therefore, the Legislature resolved "to provide for the sustainable management of the [Delta] ecosystem,

5 to provide for a more reliable water supply for the state, to protect and enhance the quality of water
6 supply from the Delta, and to establish a governance structure that will direct efforts across state
7 agencies to develop a legally enforceable Delta Plan." Water Code § 85001(c), emphasis added.

8 36. The Delta Reform Act was meant to advance the "coequal goals" of restoring the Delta

9 ecosystem and enswing water supply reliability. Water Code § 85054. The Legislature found that eight
10 "objectives" were inherent in those coequal goals:

11 (a) Manage the Delta's water and environmental resources and the water resources of

12 the state over the long term.

13 (b) Protect and enhance the unique cultural, recreational, and agricultural values of the California Delta as an evolving place.
14 (c) Restore the Delta scosystem, including its fisheries and wildlife, as the heart of a

15 healthy estuary and wetland ecosystem.
(d) Promote statewide water conservation, water use efficiency, and sustainable water
16 use.

17 (e) Improve water quality to protect human health and the environment consistent with

18 achieving water quality objectives in the Delta.

19 (f) Improve the water conveyance system and expand statewide water storage.

20 (g) Reduce risks to people, property, aud state interests in the Delta by effective emcrgency preparedness, appropriate land uses, and investments in flood protection.
21 (h) Establish a new governance structure with the authority, responsibility,

22 accountability, scientific support, and adequate and secure funding to achieve these objectives.

23 Water Code § 85020, emphasis added.

24 37. The Legislature also declared that:

25 The policy of the State of California is to reduce reliance on the Delta in meeling

26 California's future water supply needs through a statewide strategy of investing iu improved regional supplies, conservation, and water use efficiensy, Each region that
27 depends on water from the Delta watershed shall improve its regional self-reliance for water through investmment in water use efficiency, water recycling, advanced water

28 technologies, local and regional water supply projects, and improved regional coordination of local and regional water supply efforis.

2 The Public Frast Doctrine

3 38. Water Code section 85023 states, "the longstanding constitutional principle of reasonable
4 use and the Public Trust Doctrine shall be the foundation of state water management policy and are
5 particularly important and applicable to the Delta."
39. In National Audubon Society v. Superior Court (1983) 33 Cal.3d 419, 426, the court noted
7 that the public trust doctrine mandates that "before state courts and agencies approve water diversions
8 they ... consider the effect of such diversions upon interests protected by the public trust, and attompt,

9 SO far as feasible, to avoid or minimize any harrn to those interests." The National Audubon Society
10 Court went on to explain:

11 Just as the history of this state shows that appropriation may be necessary for efficient use of

12 water despite unavoidable harm to public trust values, it demonstrates that an appropriative water rights system administered without consideration of the public trust may cause

13 unnecessary and unjustified harm to trust interests. As a matter of practical necessity the state may have to approve appropriations despite foresecable harma to public trust uses. In so
14 doing, however, the state must bear in mind its duty as trustee to consider the effect of the taking on the public trust, and to presetve, so far as consistent with the public interest, the

15 uses protected by the trust.

16 Id., citations omitted.

17 40, "Public trust easements are traditioually defined in terms of navigation, commerce and
18 fisheries. They have been held to include the right to fish, hunt, bathe, swim, to use for boating ard
19 general recreation purposes the navigable waters of the state, and to use the bottom of the navigable
20 waters for anchoring, standing, Or other purposes." Marks v. Whitney (1971) 6 Cal.3d 251, 259. For
21 nearly 50 years it has been settled law in California that public trust values also "encompass[]...the
22 preservation of those lands in their natural state, so that they may serve as ccological wnits for scientific
23 study, as open space, and as environments which provide food and habitat for birds and marine life, and
24 which favorably affect the scenery and climate of the area."
25 41. Although compliance with CEQA "may assist an agency in complying with its duties under
26 the public trust doctrine ... 6] CEQA review of a project does not necessarily or automatically satisfy
27 the agency's affirmative duties to talce the trust into account and protect public trust uses whenever
28 feasible." San Francisco Baykeeper Inc. v. State Lunds Com. (2018) 29 Cal.App.5th 562, 571. "[A)

H public trust use is not any use that may confer public benefit, but rather a use that facilitates public
2 access, public enjoyment, or public use of trust land." Td. at 570.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
42. "[T]he Sacramento-San Joaquia River Delta is a natural resource of statewide, national, and

5 international significance, containing ireplaceable resources." FRC § 29701. The Delta is the largest

6 and most productive estuatine system on the West Coast of North and South America, but its future is in
peril. It is the State of California's avowed policy "to recognize, preserve, and protect those resources of
8 the delta for the use and enjoyment of current aud future generations." Id.

9 43. The Delta's imminent ecologic collapse is well-recognized and indisputable. It has two
10 principal causes. First, an unsustainable proportion of the Delta's freshwater flows has been diverted for

11 decades by the Central Valley Project ("CVP*) and the California (or "State') Water Project ("SWP").

12 Second, for too long, agricultural divexters have discharged subsurface drainage and surface run-off
13 contaminated with salt, selenium, and other toxic substanoes into groundwater and the rivers that arc
14 tributary to the Delta. This one-two punch of diminished freshwater flows and increased temperature,

15 salinity, herbicides, pesticides, and heavy metals has pushed the Delta to the brink of ecologic collapse.

16 44. Duc to excessive diversions of water for consumptive use, many species of fish endemic to
17 the Delta have already gone extinct, including the Sacramento perch, formerly one of the most abundant

18 fishes of the Delta, which disappeared in the 1970s. Just 12 indigenous species remain, and these are in

19 grave danger. Since the SWP and CVP began operation, the Sacramento River winter and spring run
20 Chinook salmon, Central Valley steelhead, North American green sturgeon and Delta smelt have been

21 driven perilously close to extirpation.

22 45. Winter run Chinook salmon were declared threatened under the federal Endangered

23 Species Act ("ES.A") in 1990 (55 Fed.Reg. 46515), and then due to continuing population decknes,
24 declared endangered in 2005 (70 Fed.Reg. 37160). Their critical habitat in the Sacramento River and its

25 tibutaries was designated in 1993. 58 Fed.Rcg. 33212. Spring run Chinook salmon were declared
26 threatened, and their critical habitat designated under the ESA. in 2005, 70 Fed.Reg. 37160, 52488.

27 Central Valley steelhead were declared threatened in 2000 (65 Fed.Reg. 52084) and their critical habitat
28 was designated in 2005 (70 Fed.Reg. 52488). The Southern distinct population segment ("DPS") of

1 North American green sturgeon was declared threatened in 2006 (71 Fed.Reg. 17757) and its critical
2 habitat was designated in 2008 (73 Fed.Reg. 2084). Delta smelt wete declared endangered in 1993 (58
Fed.Reg. 12854) and their critical habitat was designated in 1994 (59 Fed.Reg. 65256).

4 46. The SWP, as originally envisioned, would have included additional dams and divetsions
that would have destroyed the frec-flowing xivers of California's North Coast and removed additional
cssential spawning and rearing habitat for salmon and steelhead. The unbuilt portion of the SWP was
7 expected to provide between five and 10 million acre fcet of water each year to the SWP system. Thus,
DWR's SWP existing contracts contemplate delivery of much more water than can be delivered in all
9  but the wettest of water years.

10 47. In. addition to harming many fish species in the Delta, the excessive use of Delta water

11 exports to irrigate contaminated soils in the San Joaquin Valley pollutes ground and surface waters that

12 flow into the Delta. Irrigation leaches pollutants from the toxic soils underlying many of the areas
13 irrigated with Delta water. The subsurface drainage and surface run off from these contaminated sois
14 contain pollutants including selenium, arsenic, boron, mercury, uranium, chromium, molybdenum and
15 sodium chlorides and gulfates. The resulting pollution of the Delta and its San Joaquin Valley tributaties
16 threateps the Delta's water quality and the fish and wildlife dependent on them.
17 48. On December 12, 2018, DWR approved the Coordinated Operations Agreement Addendum

18 ("COA Addendum*), which modified DWR's operation of the SWP in coordination with the Bureau of

19 Reclamation. Yet DWR failed to conduct any eoviromental review of that action.

20 49. O11 or about April 19, 2019, DWR. issued a Notice of Preparation ("NOP*) for the Project,
21 notifying the public that it would act as the lead agency for tho preparation of an EIR for the Project.
22 That Notice of Preparation did not include a clear description of the Project DWR proposed to undertake.
23 While the NOP indicates that the EIR is intended to facilitate the issuance of an ITP by CDFW for
24 DWR's operations of the SWP, it failed to provide a particularized description of a project under
25 consideration. Instead, the NOP informed the public merely that DWR will continue to operate the SWP
26 *to provide flood control and water supply for agrieultural, muniolpal, iudustrial, recrcational, and
27 environmental purposes consistent with applicable legal requirements." April 19, 2019 Notice of
28 Preparation, p. 3.

3 impacts of the COA Addendum in the Project's EIR in order to provide the public "with transparent
analysis of the environmental effects." NOP 4.

5 51. Conservation Groups submitted detailed comments dated May 28, 2019, iuforming DWR of

6 its need to comply with CEQA, the Public Trust Doctrine, and the Delta Reform Act.

7 52. Opor about November 22, 2019, DWR issued its Draft Environmental Impact Report

00 ("DEIR") for the Project. The DEIR included a No Project Alternative, as well as a Proposed Project,
and Alternatives 2e, 2b, 3, 4 and 5 to the Proposed Project.

9

10 53. On or about Jannary 6, 2020, Conservation Groups submitted additional detailed comments

11 addressing shortcomings in the DEIR. and related violations of CHQA, and reminding DWR of its nced
to comply with the Delta Reform Act and Public Trust Doctrine.

12

13 54. On.or about March 27, 2020, DWR certified the FEIR and approved the Refined Alternative

14 2B, a Project Altemative developed after DWR's circulation of the DEIR. DWR's Notice of
Determination was received by the State CEQA. Clearinghouse maintained by the Governor's Office of
15 Planning and Research on March 30, 2020. In approving the Project, DWR incorrectly determined that
16 the Project would have no significant impacts.

18 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

19 (Violation of CEQA)

20 (Alleged by Al Petitioners Against All Respoudents)

21 55. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by

22 reference.

23 56. Petitioners bring this First Cause of Action purzuant to PRC sections 21168 and 21168.5, of

24 the grounds that DWR committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion, by failing to proceed in the manner

25 required by law, in approving a deeply flawed Project based on a legally inadequate FEIR.

26 DWR Failed to Utilize a Stable Project Description as CEOA Requires

27 57. CEQA requires DWR to provide a clear description of the Project under consideration. "An

28 accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an informative and legally sufficicnt

2 Washpe Meadows Community, 17 Cal.App.5th at 287. Yet DWR failed to do so.

3 58. Instead, the DEIR states:
The Proposed Project, which is the preferred alternative in this [DEIR], consists of

5 multiple elements that characterize future operations of SWP facilities, modify ongoing programs being implemented as part of SWP aperations, improve specific activities that

6 would enhance protection of special-status fish species, or support ongoing studies and research on these special-status species to improve the basis of knowledge and
7 management of these species. Implementation of these elcments is intended to continue operation of the SWP and deliver up to the full contracted water amounts while

8 minimizing and fully mitigating the take of listed species consistent with CESA requirements.

10 Proposed Project. DEIR 3-15 to 3-17; FEIR M.3-16 to MII.3-19. Yet this discussion lacks sufficient

11 clarity and detail to Inform the reader tegarding what DWR proposed to do. Id. The alternatives to the
12 Proposed Project wete described in similarly vague and obfuscatory ways. FEIR III.5-I.

13 59. Only after circulating the DEIR did DWR provide a description of what the Proposed
14 Project was intended to accomplish. FEIR. III.3-16. DWR's changes to the description of the Proposed

15 Project include a belated disclosure of its planned duration. Id. By failing to provide a stable and finite
16 description of the Project, DWR violated CEQA.

17 60. The Project, as approved, is not described in the DEIR. DWR developed Refined
18 Alterative 2B after it circulated the DEIR. FEIR I-1. Thus, the FEIR includes entirely new analysis
19 and discussion that was not provided to the public for review and comment before approval. FEIR IIL.5-

20 38 to JIII.5-285. DWR's description. of the Project WaS not sufficient to inform the public of the Project
21 that it approved.

22 DWR Failed to Provide a Clear Discussion of the Project's Purpose and Objectives
23 61. CEQA requires that the EIR include "[a] statement of the objectives sought by the proposed
24 project. The statement of objectives should include the underlying purpose of the project and may
25  disçuss the project benefits." Guidelines § 15124(b). "[A] lead agency may not give a project's
26  purpose an artificially narrow definition. North Coast Rivers Alliance, 243 Cal.App.4th at 668.

T DEIR, DWR stated that:

2 The objective of the Proposed Project is to continue the long-term operation of the SWP consistent with applicable laws, contractual obligations, and agreements. DWR proposes 3 to store, divert, and convey water in accordance with DWR's cxisting water rights to delivet water pursuant to water contracts and agreements up to full contract quantities.
4 DWR seeks to optimize water supply and improve operational flexibility while protecting fish and wildlife based on the best available scientific information.
5
NOP DEIR 3-1. It was only after DWR circulated the DEIR for public comment that it created a 6

7 statement of the underlying purpose of the Project:
The underlying purpose of the Proposed Project is to obtain incidental take authorization 8 from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife pursuant to the California Endangered Species Act to allow DWR to contique the long-term operation of the SWP 9 consistent with applicable laws, contractual obligations, and agreements.

10

11 FEIR I.6.5-15. Thus, DWR falled to provide the public with a clear explanation of what DWR intended

12 the Project to do, aud why. But by delaying the formulation of the statement of underlying purpose until

13 the conclusion of the environmental review process, DWR improperly curtailed informed public

14 participation. Without a clear statement of the underlying goal of the Project, DWR frustrated the

15 formulation and discussion of reasonable alternatives to the Project, and the public's ability to weigh in
regarding the same. 16 DWR Failed to Comply With CEQA's Cousultation Requirements
17 63. For every CEQA project that had "a notice of preparation or a notice of negative declaration 18

19 or mitigated negative declaration filed on or after July 1, 2015" - such as this Project - the lead agency is

20 required to consult with California Indiau Tribes, Stats, 2014, ch. 532 (A.B. 52), § 11(c), cff. Jan 1,
2015); PRC § 21080.3.1. For the purposes of CEQA, PRC section 21080.3.1(b) incorporates the 21 definition of "consultation" found in Government Code section 65352.4. Thus, DWR was required to
22
undertake
23

24 [a] meauingful and timely process of seeking, discussing, and considering carefuily the vlews of others, in a manner that is cognizant of all parties* cultural values and, where 25 feasible, seeking agreement, Consultation between govemment agencies and Native American tribes shall be conducted in a way that is mutually respectful of each party's 26 sovereignty. Consultation shall also recognize the tribes' potential needs for
27 confidentiality with respect to places that have traditional tribal cultral significance.

28 Government Code § 65352.4, emphasis added.

1 64. Consultation is complete either when parties "agree to measures to avoid or mitigate a
2 significant effect on a tribal cultural resource" or "a party, acting in good faith and after reasonable
3 effort, concludes that mutual agreement cannot be reached." PRC § 21080.3.2.(b)(1)-(2), emphasis
4 added. To determine whether a project has an impact on a tribal cultural resource, DWR is required to
5 consider the significance of the resource to the Winnemem Wintu Tribe. PRC 21074.

6 65. DWR failed to consult with the Winnemem Wintu Ttibe before preparing and circulating
7 the DEIR, despite Conservation Group's May 28, 2019 comment letter informing DWR of its duty to do
8 50. DWR made no effort to cure this defect in response to Conservation Group's January 7, 2020

9 comment letter on the DEIR, which highlighted this ongoing deficiency. Instead, DWR asserts that it
10 had neither a duty to consult with the Winnemem Wintu Tribe, nor a duty to respond to a tequest for
11 consultation from the Winnemem Wintu Tribe. lndeed, DWR improperly ignored and misconstrued the
12 Winnemem Wintu Tribe's scoping comments. The FEIR states that while "at the Delta Conveyance
13 Informational Meeting for The Califomia Tribal Community in Liucoln, California, DWR's Tribal
14  Policy Advisor reminded the Winnemum [sic] Wintu representative that DWR had not yet reccived a
15 request for consultations per the Public Resources Code" -- despite having received the Tribe's scoping
16  comments which included a request for consultation. Thus, whether or not a supposed "Tribal
17 Representative" purportedly "agreed that such, a letter had yet to be submitted," during a purported
18  conversation with DWR without counsel present, DWR had a clear duty to act upou the written request it
19  had received in the Winnememn Winfu Tribe's formnal scoping comments.
20 66. By proceeding with the Project without undertaking the necessary consultation, DWR failed
21 to consider the Winnernem Wintu Trive's expertise and evidence in identifying, evaluating and
22 discussing the Project's potential impacts on the Tribe's cultural resources.
23 The FEUR Fails to Appropriately Address the
24 Coordinate Operations Agreement Amendment

25 67. Despite its commitment in its NOP that the EIR would evaluate the impacts associated with
26 the COA Addendura, DWR failed to provide an adequate and transparent analysis of the COA
27  Addendum in the FEIR. Instead, DWR incorporated the COA Addendum's changes to SWP operations
28 into the environmental baseline for the Froject. And while DWR presents modeling that compares the

2 COA Addendum and the 1986 Coordinated Operations Agreemeat, it does not address how the Project'g

3 impacts would differ with (or without) the COA Addendum. Further, DWR's hyperlink to complete

4 CalSim II model output for the 2018 COA Addendura. aud 1986 COA Studies did not provide the public
with the promised information.

5

6 68. DWR's failure to provide accurate and transpatent analysis of the COA. Addenduu fails to

7 foster informed decisionmaking and public participation, contrary to CEQA's informational mandstes.

8 The FEIR Fails to Disclose and Analyze the Proiect's Impacts
69. The purpose of an. EIR is to provide agencios and the public with information about a
9 proposed project's potential environmental effects, ways to minimize those effects, and potential
10 altematives to the project. PRC § 21061, The BIR must "include a detailed statement** describing, inter

11 alia, all of the proposed project's significant effects on the environment, alternatives to the project, and
12 | potential mitigation measures. PRC § 21100(b).

13 70. The FEIR fails to disclose the impacts of the Project in several ways. First, DWR
14 improperly limited the Project area to include only "tbe SWP Service Areas and Existing SWP storage

15 and export facilitics located within the Delta and vicinity." FEIR IIL.3-1. DWR included only the arEas
16 recelving Project benefits, and excluded areas the Project would harm. Equally improper, it excluded the
17  related CVP facilities from the Project Area, as well as DWR facilities upstream of the Delta. FEIR

18 IIL.1-4, I0.3-1. Thus, despite the interrelated nature of their SWP and CVP operations, and the manner in
19 which cach water project alters the conditions for the other, the DWR's Project Area excludes
20

21. watersheds and water facilities that will face changed environmental conditions due to DWR's Project

22 operation. In so doing, DWR avoided disclosing potentially significant impacts that would occur due to
the Project's implementation, including impacts surrounding the operation of Oroville Reservolr and the
23 Trinity River System, and all CVP water sources that would be primarily under the control of the Bureau
24 | including the Trinity, Sacramento and American rivers. This failure led DWR to omit discussions of the
25 impacts to fisheries resources upstream of the confluence of the Feather and Sacramento Rivers,
26 Including in. the Trinity River, even when the Project may impact flow and temperature in these
27 waterways. This violates CEQA. Friends of the Eel River v. Sonoma County Water Agency (2013) 108
28 Cal.App.4th 859, 870-872 (impacts on interconnected waterways must be examined in. EIR.).

Verified Potition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint - 18-

04/28/2020 11:46 5105599654 VOLKER LAW OFFICES PAGE 23/32

71. DWR's FEIR disclaims any need to study impacts caused by its Project upstreamn of the

2 confluence of the Sacramento and Feather Rivers because, it argues, DWR has limited ability to take

3 actión to mitigate those effects. But this does not excuse DWR's failure to disclose these impacts.

4 CEQA required DWR to do so. Were DWR to have determined that appropriate mitigation tocasures
cxist but are outside its jurisdiction to mandate, it was required to make findings that indicate that "those
6 changes or alterations are within the responsibility and jurisdiction of another public agency and have
*2 been, or cat and should be, adopted by that other agency." PRC § 21081(a)(2). DWR was not

8 authorized to ignore potentially feasible mitigation measures for significant impacts simply because

9 other agencies may be required to implement them. Habitat and Watershed Caretakers v. City of Santa
10 Cruz (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 1277, 1304-1305; City of San Diego v. Boord of Trustees of California

11 State University (2015) 61 Cal,4th 945, 957.

12 72. The FEIR improperly concludes that the Project will not have water quality impacts from
13 proposed fall. pulse flows of agricultural drain water. FEIR 11.6.5-19 to 11.6.5-20. DWR instead claims
14 that the timing of these flows will prevent the introduction of pollutants, or that the use of these flows

15 will be "adaptively managed" to avoid water quality impacts. Id. Neither position is based on science,

16 let alone actual empirical evidence. "An EIR must foous on impacts to the existing environment, not
17 hypothetical situations," County of Amador V. El Dorado County Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th
18 931,955. The Project's fall pulse flows of agricultural drain water would be composed of available
19 | drainage water from rice fields discharged at the end of the growing season. FEIR IL.3-32 to III.3-33,
20  IIT.5-57 to III.5-58 (use of fall pulse flows wider Refined Alternative 2B), The FEIR concedes that:
21 "mercury methylation can occur when lands are flooded, such as... for rice production." FEIR 11.6.5,-

22 19. Yet the FEIR inexplicably - and falsely claims that the use of water that will be drained from rice
23 fields would not introduce additional contaminants. Id. DWR's discussion and analysis of this impact
24 fails to foster informed decsionmaking.

25 73. As part of the Project, DWR proposes "using agricultural drain water from Colusa Drain

26 over a 4-week period [in the fall to] improve downstream transport of phytoplankton." FEIR III.5-
27 58. But DWR never appropriately studied whethor this drain water would be contaminated with
28 pesticides and other chemicals commonly used in the rice fields drained by tho Colusa Drain, and

r whether using this water as proposed would have resultant impacts on water quality and fishcries.

2 74. DWR's FEIR also fails to discuss and disclose the potential impacts of the Project's

3 pesticide use. The Project includes applications of Aquathol K. and copper-based herbicides. Yet DWR
fails to disclose the significant risks of harm to fish posed by coppet-based products, let alone discuss
whether these risks are mitigated adequately. Instead, DWR telies solely upon herbicide application

6 procedures and water quality sampling to claini that the Project will not have significant impacts.
75. By improperly conflating its discussion of the Project's impacts with its discussion of

8 measures designed to minimize those impacts, DWR. bas prevented the public from understanding the

9 scope and severity of those impacts and subsequently, the effloacy of the mitigation measures that the
10 DWR improperly presumed would reduce those impacts to insignificance. The distinction is not onc of
11 semantics, but instead of purpose and effect. Lotus v. Dep't of Transportation (2014) 223 Cal.App.4th.

12 8 645, 655-656, 656 n. 8 (discussing the distinction between measures that are part of the project, such as
13  paving mixes, from measures that are "plainly mitigation measures," such as restorative planting).

14 76. The FEIR improperly concludes that the Project will not harmn chinook or cobo salmon. Yet

15 the Project will harm both. First, by altering the operation of the SWP, the Project will result in changes

16 to the Bureau's operation of the CVP, including the Trinity River flows which otherwise flow through
17 the Klamath River and are avallable for coho salmon in that system. Second, the FEIR discloses that in

18 wet, above normal, and. below normal wator year types, Retined Alternative 2B is modeled to have
19 higher loss of juvenile Spring Run Chinook salmon when compared to existing conditions. FEIR III.5-

20 177. In wet water years, this loss is projected to be 56% higher. Id, This increase in loss corrclates with
21 Refined Alternative 2B's increase in south-of-delta exports in wetter conditions. FEIR II.5-179.

22 77. The FEIR likewisc aszumes - contrary to a long history of Endangered Species Act

23 violations - that DWR and the Bureau will continue to comply with the requirements of the 2009
24 Biological Opinion for the Coordinated Operation of the SWP and CVP, skewing its analysis to obscure

25 and understate Project impacts on fish and wildlife.
26 DWR Failed Include an Adequate Discussiou of Alternatives

27 78. Under CEQA, am EIR must focus on alternatives that would lessen significant effects, even
if they "would impede to some degree the attainment of the project objectivos, or be moTe costly." 28

Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate & Complaint - 20 -

1 Cuidelines § 15126.6(b).

2 79. CEQA requires an EIR to "include sufficient information about cach alternative to allow
3 meaningful evaluation, analysis, and comparison with the proposed project." Guidelines § 15126.6(d).

4 Agencics must prevent "significant, avoidable damage to the environment" through the use of feasible

5 altemnatives or mitigation measures. Guidelines & 15002(a)(3); PRC §§ 21002, 21002.1, 21081. Project
6 approval should be withheld where such measures or alternatives exist, but are, as here, ignored.

7 Guidelines & 15021(a)(2),

8 80. The FEIR's presentation of the Project's alternatives fails to foster informed
9 decisionmaking. In addressing the Project and the alternatives thereto, DWR failed to detail how each

10 alternative compares to the Proposed Project. For example, the No Project Alternative discussion simply
11 states that it does not include the Proposed Project's actions, and refers the reader to the DEIR's
12  discussion of the existing environmental conditions. FEIR III. 5-1 to 5-5. Ouly in updating the analysis
13 to include Refined Alternative 2B did DWR provide any level of detailed analysis that might allow the
14 public to contrast the options under consideration. FEIR III. 5-38 to III.5-285. And this information was
15 | only made available to the public after DWR approved the Project. The discussion of the other
16 alternatives provides some additional information, but continues to obfuscate the differences between the
17 various alternatives. FEIR III.5-6 to IIT.5-38 (discussing Alternative 2A), III.5-286 to IT.5-329
18 (discussing Alternatives 3 and 4). For example, the FEIR's discussion of Altemative 4 indicates that it
19 would replace summer and fall actions of the Proposed Project to add additional Delta Smelt habitat
20  criteria. FEIR III.5-301. The FEIR indicates that this change may require "additional outflow" which
21 would be provided through "some combination of" (1) "SWP and CVP export reductions," (2) increased
22 releases from Oroville Reservoir, or (3) "[w]ater purchases from other water users." FEIR IIL5-301 to
23 III.5.302. But, S with its discussion of the Proposed Project, the FETR fails to examine the impacts of
24 these changes throughout the impacted watershed. And, because DWR excluded Oroville Reservoit and
25 the Feather River from its analysis, the FEIR lacks the information necessary to understand the impacts
26 of Alternative 4 as compared to the No Project Altornative or the Proposed Project. FEIR UI. 5-316
27 (discussing impacts upstream of the Delta for Alternative 4).

1 DWR Fails to Diseuss Inconsistencies Between the Project and the Applicable Delta Plan

2 81. CEQA requires that the EIR "distuss any inconsistencies between the proposed project and
3 applicable... regional plans" such as the Delta Stewardship Council's Delta Plan. Guidelines &

4 15125(d). Despite this requirement, DWR failed to include such a discussion in the FEIR, on the
5 mistaken premise that the Delta Plan does not apply to the Project, DWR's failure to include this
6 analysis violates CEQA.

7 DWR Sbould Have Recirculated the DEIR

8 82. Guidelines section 15088.5(a) requires agencies "to recirculate an EIR when significant new

9 information is added to the EIR. after public notice is given of the availability of the draft EIR... . but

10 before certification." New information is deerned "significant" where "the EIR is changed in a way that

11 deprives the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment upon [1] a substantial adverso
12 environmental effect of the project or [2] a feasible way to mitigate or avoid such an effect.. that the
13 projoct's proponents have declined to implement." Id.

14 83. Here, as discussed above, DWR made substantial changes to the EIR after circulating the
15 | DEIR. The FEIR includes 247 new pages of analysis of the impacts of Refined Alterative 2B alone.
16 FEIR IL5-38 to FEIR II.5-285. The significant addition of this Project Alternative in the FEIR
17 precluded public comment on the Project that DWR approved, including the ability to comment on the
18 additional impacts that Refined Alternative 2B may have on the environment.
19 84. Likewise DWR's significant alteration of the Project's fundamental purpose in the FEIR
20 precluded public participation and requires recirculation,

21 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

22 (Violation of the 2009 Delta Reform Act)

23 (Alleged by All Petittoners Against All Respondents)
24 85. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by
25 reference.

26 86. The Delta Reform Act, Water Code sections 85000 et seq-; was passed by the Legislature in
27 recognition of the fact that the "[t]he Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed and California's water
28 | infrastructure are in crisis" and that "frJesolving the crisis requires fundamontal roorganization of the

I Verlded Petition for Writ of Maudate & Complaint 22 -

state's management of Delta watershed resources." Water Code § 85001(a). The Legislature's goal was
2 "to provide for the sustainable management of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta ecosystem, to provido

3 for a more reliable water supply for the state, to protect and enhance the quality of water supply from the

4 Delta, and to establish a govemnance structure that will dircct efforts across state agencies to develop a

5 legally enforceable Delta Plan." Water Codc § 85001(c).

6 87. The Delta Refonn Act requires any state agency "that proposes to undertake a covered
action" to "prepare a written certification of consistency with detailed findings as to whether the covered

8 action is consistent with the Delta Plan" and submit that written finding to the Delta Stewardship
Council. Water Code 6 85225.

10 88. The Delta Reform Act defines "[c]overed action" as "a pian, program or project" as defined

11 by PRC section 21065 that:

12 (1) Will occur, in whole or in part, within the boundaries of the Delta or Suisun Marsh.
13 (2) Will be carried out, approved, or funded by the gtate or a local public agency.
14 (3) Is covered by one or more provisions of the Delta Plan.

15 (4) Will have a significant impact on achievement of one or both of the coequal

16 goals or the implementation of government-sponsored flood control programs to reduce risks to people, property, and state interests in the Deita.
17 Water Code § 85057.5(a). The Project meets these criteria, and is therefore a covered action. While the

18 Delta Refoun Act states that "[rjoutine maintenance and operation of the State Water Project" is not a

19 covered action, the Project does not qualify for that exemption because it is ueither routine maintenance
20 nor routine operation of the SWP. Water Code § 85057.5(b).
21 89. The 2013 Delta Plao prepared by the Delta Stewardship Council was found invalid and set
22 aside by the Sacramento Superior Court beoause it failed to satisfy the requirements of the Delta Reforin
23 Act. Specifically, the Delta Plan failed to include "quantified or otherwise measurable targets associated
24 with acbieving teduced Delta reliauce, reduced environmental harm from invasive species, restoring
25 more natural flows, and increased water supply teliability, in accotdance with the Delta Reform Act."
26 Ruling on Submitted Matter, JCCP 4758 (Sacramento Superior Court, May 18, 2016) at 26. To address
27 these Delta Plan deficiencies, the Delta Stewardship Council amended the Delta Plan in 2018.
28 Petitioners - and others - have challenged the Delta Stewardship Council's 2018 Delta Plan

2 other laws requiring informed decisionmaking. Sacramento Superior Court Case Nos.

90. DWR denieg that the Project is covered action under the Delta Refor Act. FEIR II.17-6.

5 But Water Code section 85057.5(b)'s exemption of "r]outine maintenance and operation of the State
6 Water Project" from the definition of covered action cannot apply to this Project, which encompasses

7 changes to the operatiou of the SWP to comply with CDFW's ITP requirements. Such changes are more

8 that simple "routine operation."

9 91. Because the Project is covered action under the Delta Reform Act, DWR cannot approve
10 the Project without first making a determination of consistency with the Delta Plan, Water Code §
11 85225. And because approval of the Project continues DWR's over-allocation of SWP water without
12 any attempt to address the Froject's conflict with the Delta Refonn Act's coequal goals, the Project is

13 inherently inconsistent with what would be required by any valid Delta Plan.

14 92. Because DWR failed to "prepare a written certification of consistency with detailed findings
15 as to whether the covered action is consistent with the Delta Plan" as required by the Delta Reform Act,
16 | its approval must be set aside. Water Code § 85225.

17 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (Violation of the Public Trust Doctriue)

19 (Alleged by Au Petitioners Against All Respondents)
20 93. The paragraphs set forth above and below are realleged and incorporated herein by

21 roference.

22 94. Water Code section 85023 states, "the longstanding constitutional principle of reasonable
23 use and the Public Trust Doctrine shall be the foundation of state water management policy and are
24  particularly important and applicable to the Delta."
25 95. In National Audubon Society v. Superior Court (1983) 33 Cal.3d 419, 426, the court noted
26 that the public trust doctrine mandates that "before state courts and ageucies approve water diversions
27 they.. consider the effect of such diversions upon interests protected by the public trust, and attempt,
28 $0 far as feasible, to avoid or minimize any harm to those interests." The National Audubon Sociery

Court went on to explain:

2 Just as the history of this state shows that appropriation may be necessary for efficient use of water despite unavoidable harm to public trust values, it demonstrates that an appropriative water rights system administered without consideration of the public trust may cause unnecessary and unjustified harm to trust interests. As a matter ofpractical necessity the state
4 may have to approve approptiations despite foreseeable harm to public trust uses. In so

5 doing, however, the state must bear in mind its duty as trustee to consider the effect of the taking on the public trust, and to preserve, so far as consistent with the public interest, the uscs protected by the trust.
6
Id., citations omitted.
7 96. "Public trust easements are traditionally defined in terms of navigation, comerce and
8

9 fisheries. They have been held to include the right to fish, hunt, bathe, swim, to use for boating and

10 general recreation purposes the navigable waters of the state, and to use the bottom of the navigable

11 waters for anchoring, standing, or other purposes." Marks, 6 Çal.3d at, 2.59. For nearly 50 years it has

12 beet scttled law in California that public trust values also "encompass[1 .. . the preservation of those

13 lands in their natural state, so that they may serve as ecological units for scientific study, as open space,

14 and as environments which provide food and habitat for birds and marine life, and which favorably affect

15 the scenery and climate of the area." Jd. at 259-260.

16 97. Although compliance with CEQA "may assist an agency in complying with its duties under

17 the public trust doctrine.. . . [] CEQA review of a project does not necessarily or automatically satisfy

18 the agency's affirrnative duties to tako the trust into account and protect public trust uses whenever

19 feasible," San Francisco Baykeeper, 29 Cal.App.5th at 571. "[A] public trust use is not any use that

20 may confer a publio benefit, but rather a use that facilitates public access, public enjoyment, or publie

21 use of trust land.33 Id, at 570. Agencies tasked with protecting public trust resources have affirmative

22 statutory and constitutional "duties to take the trust into account and protect public trust uses whenever

23 feasible," based on a fair and fully informed balancing of the impacts of these alternatives QJ1 public trust

24 resources. San Francisco Baykeeper, 29 Cal.App.5th at 571.

25 98. The Project will adversely affect numerous public trust resources, including flows and

26 habitat necessary for fish, wildlife, and recreation, and do so for non-public trust purposes - the

27 diversion of Delta water for consumptive use. Despite public comment regarding the Project's impacts

28 to public trust resources, and the need to protect those resources from hatm by non-public trust uses guch

1 as the Project's diversion of Delta water for consumptive uses, DWR argues that Its CEQA analysis is all
2 that was necessary to address or examine the issue in its FER. Yet DWR's public trust duties require

3 DWR to examine whether its activities will protect public trust uses independently of any analysis
required by CEQA, and to protect those public trust uses from harm from non-public trust uscs.

5 99. By approving the Project without appropriate consideration of whether additional feasible

6 altematives could benefit public trust resources to greater extent than the Projoct, and without

7 adequately protecting public trust resources and uses from non-public trust uses, DWR abdicated its
affirmative statutory and constitutional "dutics to take the trust into account and protect public trust uses

9 whenever feasible," based on a fair and fully informed balancing of the impacts of these alternatives on
10 public trust resources. San Francisco Baykeeper, 29 Cal.App.5th at 571.

17 101. DWR proceeded in excess of its jurisdiction and abused its discretion in purporting to
