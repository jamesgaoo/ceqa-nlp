Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 Introduction

2 1. Petitioner Laurel Heights Improvement Association filed its first environmental

3 citizen suit to enforce the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) over 30 years ago.

4 The California Supreme Court issued a unanimous landmark decision that comprehensively

5 interpreted CEQA and has guided environmental compliance for countless projects in the
decades since. (Laurel Heights Improvement Association of San Francisco, Inc., v. Regents of the 6 University of California (Laurel Heights) (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376.)
7 The association now a seeks a second peremptory writ due to needless significant
8 environmental impacts attending approvals of a million-and-a-half square feet of mixed-use

9 development in San Francisco's Laurel Heights neighborhood. The project proposes

10 substantial demolition of buildings and landscaping at the historic Fireman's Fund Insurance

11 Company complex that is currently the UCSF Laurel Heights campus.

24 The association contends that the city's approvals of the project, including affordable
25 housing at a density that the association fully supports, fail to comply with CEQA. The city certified

26 and relied upon an inadequate environmental impact report (EIR) and failed and refused to

27 adopt feasible mitigation measures and project alternatives to reduce significant impacts.

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 2

1 Following its review of a substantial regional project in southern California a few years

2 ago, the California Supreme Court ruled that voluminous environmental review - indeed, a

3 12-year process - remained flawed. The Court emphasized that neither a project's touted
merit nor delay attending environmental compliance may affect judicial review, which
4

5 does not turn on our independent assessment of the project's environmental merits CEQA's requirements for informing the public and decision makers of adverse
6 impacts, and [imposing] feasible mitigation measures, still need to be enforced.

7 (Center for Biological Diversity v. Dept. of Fish and Wildlife (2015) 62 Cal.4th 204, 240, italics
8 added; cf. dis. opn. of Chin, J., at 254.) Here, in a much shorter timeframe, the sole EIR and
9 CEQA process fail to comply with the mandates of CEQA.

10 Appellant respectfully requests judgment and a peremptory writ of mandamus in the

11 public interest to enforce CEQA's protections for Laurel Heights and its environs.

12 Jurisdiction
13 2. This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code section 21168 and Code
14 of Civil Procedure section 1094.5. The parties and the environmental resources at issue are
15 located in the City and County of San Francisco.

16

17 Environmental Leadership CEQA Challenge

3.
18 The Governor has certified the 3333 California Street Mixed Use Project as a
leadership project under Public Resources Code sections 21182-21184 et seq. and it is subject to
19 California Rules of Court, Rule 3.2223, and other associated statutes and rules for leadership
20 projects. The person or entity that applied for certification of the project as a leadership project
21 must, if the matter goes to the Court of Appeal, make the payments required by Public

22 Resources Code section 21183, subdivision (f). The statutes and rules for leadership projects

23 expedite judicial review but do not waive or affect any of CEQA's procedural or substantive

24 mandates in any manner.
Parties
25
4.
26 Petitioner Laurel Heights Improvement Association of San Francisco, Inc., is a
non-profit California corporation formed in 1950. The association's purposes are to protect
27 and improve the real property known as the Laurel Heights tract, to promote the mutual
28 welfare of its members, and to do any and all other acts and things, and to exercise any and all

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 3

1 other powers a that a non-profit corporation could do and exercise and which now or hereafter

2 may be authorized by or not inconsistent with the laws of the United States or of the State of

3 California. Members of the association enjoy and appreciate the 3333 California buildings and
landscaping and will be affected by the construction and operational noise, traffic, air
4 emissions, impairment of historical resources, excavation, destruction of trees, and other
environmental impacts that would result from the proposed project. The association brings
6 this petition on behalf of all others similarly situated that are too numerous to be named and

7 brought before this Court as petitioners. Its members objected to the respondents' approval of

8 the 3333 California Street Mixed Use Project and exhausted their administrative remedies.
5. Respondents City and County of San Francisco and its Board of Supervisors
(collectively, the city) is the governmental body that approved the project and certified its 10 environmental impact report and is the lead agency responsible for CEQA compliance.
11 6. Real parties in interest Laurel Heights Partners, LLC, a Delaware Limited
12 Liability Company, and its project manager Don Bragg are the 3333 California Street Mixed

13 Use Project proponents named as applicants (collectively, applicant) in the Notice of

14 Determination filed by the city on December 2, 2019.
7.
15 Does 1 to 20 are fictitiously named respondents and real parties in interest whose
true names and capacities are currently unknown to the association. If and when their true
16 names and capacities are known, the association will amend this petition to assert them.
17 8. A copy of this petition has been mailed to the California Attorney General.

1 General Allegations

2 9. The paragraphs below refer to and rely on information in documents that will be

3 lodged with this court as part of the record of proceedings.

4 Environmental Setting

5 10. The 10-acre project site at 3333 California Street is in the Laurel Heights

6 neighborhood. Presidio Heights lies to the north. Pacific Heights and the Western Addition lie
to the east and portions of the Laurel Heights area and the Anza Vista area of the inner
7 Richmond lie to the south. Built in 1957 on the site of the former Laurel Hill Cemetery, a
8 354,000 square-foot, a horizontal four-story International Style building and 13,000 square-foot

9 annex building on the site were designed by master architect Edward Bradford Page (1905-

10 1994) for the Fireman's Fund Insurance Company's new corporate headquarters. Landscaping

11 is an integral part of the original design by the highly-acclaimed master landscape

12 architectural firm of Eckbo, Royston & Williams.
11. The Fireman's Fund building dramatically transformed the former cemetery
13 site and stands as the most prominent postwar commercial development in the Laurel Heights
14 neighborhood. The building retains integrity in all seven categories of historicity - location,

15 setting, design, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association. It is eligible for the National

16 Register of Historic Places and is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources.

27 12. In 1985, the Regents of the University of California purchased the site to alleviate
28 space constraints at its Parnassus campus. Concerns over the potential dangers of conducting

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 5

1 "scientific research using toxic chemicals, carcinogens, and radioactive materials" in the

2 residential neighborhood prompted an EIR process. The association brought a successful

3 CEQA challenge resulting in the Supreme Court decision cited above. UCSF ultimately
implemented an alternative plan for offices and social and behavioral research and instruction.
4

5 Administrative Process

6 13. The proposed 3333 California Street Mixed Use project as described in the Notice

7 of Determination filed by the city on December 2, 2019, would demolish the annex building,
surface parking lots, and circular garage ramps; partially demolish the four-story office
Fireman's Fund building and divide it into two separate buildings, vertically expanding the
o existing building to add two to three levels; construct 13 new buildings that would include
10 978,000 square feet of residential uses containing a total of 744 units, approximately 35,000
11 square feet of retail use, and approximately 15,000 square feet of child care use and

12 approximately 400,000 square feet devoted to off-street vehicular parking with 754 parking

13 spaces, bicycle parking, loading facilities, and streetscape alterations.
14.
14 The city published the project's Initial Study in April 2018. The Draft EIR was

15 published in November 7, 2018 with a 60-day public comment period. The city's historic
preservation commission and planning commission held public hearings on the Draft EIR in
16 December 2018. Responses to comments were published on August 22, 2018.
17 15. In September 2019, following public hearing the city's planning commission

18 certified the Final EIR; a adopted CEQA findings, a Statement of Overriding Considerations,

19 a and a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program; recommended approval of planning

20 code and zoning map amendments to create the 3333 California Street Special Use District;
recommended execution of the project Development Agreement; and approved a Conditional
21 Use Authorization and Planned Unit Development. The same month, the city's Public Works
22 Director approved a Tentative Map conditioned on final approval by the Board of Supervisors
23 and the Mayor of all project-related legislation, relied upon the City's adopted CEQA findings,

24 Statement of Overriding Considerations, and the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting

25 Program, and recommended passage of a major encroachment permit ordinance.
16.
26 The city's Municipal Transportation Agency Board of Directors approved aspects
of the project under its jurisdiction and adopted the CEQA findings, Statement of Overriding
27 Considerations, and the Mitigation, Monitoring and Reporting Program related to
28 transportation and circulation in October 2019.

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 6

1

1 17. The association filed administrative appeals of the planning commission's

2 CEQA-related actions and approvals and the Public Works Director's conditional approval of

3 the Tentative Map. During the administrative proceedings, including the appeal to the board
of supervisors, the association identified mitigation measures and project alternatives to allow
4 the mixed-use development to proceed without loss of housing units but with substantial
5 reduction to significant impacts to the historic building and landscaping.

6 18. Following public hearing, the board of supervisors upheld the planning

7 commission's certification of the Final EIR, the planning commission's approval of the

8 Conditional Use Authorization and Planned Unit Development, and the city Public Works

9 Director's approval of the Tentative Map, and adopted the planning commission's CEQA
Findings and its own supplemental CEQA findings and mitigation, a Statement of Overriding
10 Considerations, and a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program on November 12, 2019.
11 Among the findings made by the board of supervisors was that the project would cause a

12 substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.

13 19. On November 12 and 19, 2019, the board of supervisors approved ordinances

14 amending the planning code and zoning map to create the 3333 California Street Special Use

15 District, approved the project Development Agreement and an ordinance authorizing a Major
Encroachment Permit, and adopted the planning commission's CEQA Findings, a Statement of
16 Overriding Considerations, the Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program, and its own
17 supplemental CEQA findings and mitigations for the three ordinances.
18 20. The city filed a Notice of Determination on December 2, 2019. This action is

19 timely-filed within the 30-day statute of limitations.

20 21. The association has no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary

21 course of law. Issuance of a peremptory writ is needed to avoid immediate, severe, and
irreparable harm to San Francisco City and County and California residents via demolition
22 and construction of the 3333 California Mixed Use project without compliance with state law.
23 The city has the capacity to correct its violations of law but has failed and refused to do so.

12 23. The association incorporates all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.

13 CEQA requires agencies to conduct a prescribed, public EIR process before

14 taking actions that may have a significant adverse environmental impact. The point of the

15 process is to inform the public and to provide necessary information to allow elected officials

16 and decisionmakers to comply with CEQA's substantive mandate: to adopt feasible project

17 mitigations and alternatives that can reduce a project's significant environmental impacts.
24. The city abused its discretion and failed to act in the manner required by law in

18 approving the 3333 California Street Mixed Use Project with significant environmental

19 impacts, inter alia and as documented and supplemented by the to-be-lodged record of
proceedings, including:
20

21 a. Certification of an inadequate EIR without a stable, accurate, finite project

22 description; with overly-narrow project objectives; with insufficient analysis of project

23 impacts, mitigations, and alternatives as a matter of law to adequately provide information to
the decisionmakers and the public (e.g., Sierra Club v. County of Fresno (2018); with inadequate

24 analysis of the revised project; with inadequate analysis of shadow impacts; failing to analyze

25 project inconsistencies with the city's general plan priorities, goals, policies, and elements; and
with inadequate analysis and mitigation for project impacts on biological resources,
26 Il construction noise, and the integrated historic architecture and landscape;

27 b. Failure to adequately respond to comments on the EIR;

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 8

1 C. Reliance on findings that are not supported by substantial evidence in the whole of

2 the record of proceedings and contrary to facts and analysis in the record, including

3 inadequate findings that all significant project environmental effects have been eliminated or
substantially lessened when feasible in light of expert analysis and information to the contrary.
4 d. Failure to adopt identified project mitigation measures and alternatives that could
5 reduce or avoid various identified environmental impacts, including mitigations set forth in

6 the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties with Guidelines for

7 Preserving, Rehabilitating, Restoring, and Reconstructing Historic Buildings to substantially reduce

8 significant impacts to the historic resources on site.

9 WHEREFORE, the association prays:
10 1. That the Court issue judgment and a peremptory writ ordering the city

11 respondents to set aside all actions and approvals relating to the 3333 California Street Mixed

12 Use Project, requiring that before further consideration of project approval the city must revise

13 and recirculate the project EIR and identify and adopt feasible mitigations and alternatives and

14 make all findings required by CEQA, supported by substantial evidence;
2. That the Court enjoin the city, real parties, and their employees and agents from
15 all physical actions furthering the project while the petition is pending and after judgment
16 pending compliance with the writ;

17 3. For the association's reasonable costs, expenses, and attorney fees pursuant to

18 Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5; and
4.
19 For other and further relief as the Court finds proper.
