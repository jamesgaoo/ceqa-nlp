VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Petitioner, CITIZENS FOR THE PRESERVATION OF R-1 ZONES ("Petitioner"),
alleges through this Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate (*Petition"), as follows:

INTRODUCTION 3

1. Petitioner challenges the approval by Respondent City of Bakersfield ("City" or
"Respondent") of the environmental determination for an ordinance that will allow hens within
areas of the City zoned as R-1, R-S, R-H and A zones ("Ordinance" or "Project"). The Project is
known as the "Urban Hens Ordinance." As noted below, implementation of the Project will have
substantial adverse impacts on the environment.

2. Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the
10 Actions and findings related to the Project, as well as the exemption determination considered by
11 Respondent. The Project was approved by the City on or about October 21, 2020. Petitioner
4-IZ06 Channishibre ys Croupuile -550 euns "pAla eJjys|!M €8€8 12 requests that the Court vacate any project approvals issued by the City, including the Ordinance,
13 8 because Respondent failed to comply with the provisions set forth under the California
SIl!H AueAeg 14 Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA") and
15 therefore failed to proceed a in a manner required by law.
PARTIES 16

17 3. Petitioner, Citizens for the Preservation of R-1 Zones ("Petitioner"), is an
18 unincorporated association whose purpose is to promote the welfare of the residents of the City
19 of Bakersfield by advocating for the rights of those than reside in R-1 zones, to encourage and
20 promote those policies and programs which will promote public health, safety and welfare and
21 reduce environmental harm to the residents residing in R-1 zones in the City of Bakersfield, to
22 encourage cooperation among all residents residing in R-1 zones, and to educate appropriate
23 governmental bodies concerning changes in existing or proposed laws affecting those that reside
24 in R-1 zones. Petitioner and its respective members have a direct and substantial beneficial
25 interest in ensuring that Respondent complies with laws relating to environmental protection.
26 Petitioner and its respective members are adversely affected by Respondents' failure to comply
27 with CEQA in approving the Project. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this
28

2

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

f

1 Petition because Petitioner and its members' environmental interests are directly and adversely
2 affected by Respondent's' approval of the Project.

4. Respondent, City of Bakersfield (*Respondent"), is a charter city incorporated
under the laws of the State of California. The City is the lead agency under the California
Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").

5. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties sued herein
as ROES 1-25, inclusive, and therefore sues these Real Parties by such fictitious names.

8 Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacities of fictitiously named
9 Real Parties in Interest. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each
10 Respondent designated herein as a ROE a has some responsibility for the events and happenings
11 alleged in this Petition. 2 d11 'dnoJo MeT |auueuo JURISDICTION AND VENUE -LZ06 LL0S  PN B LAIMGSCO SIl!H AjeASg 12

13 6. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1094.5 of the Code
14 of Civil Procedure, and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.
15 7. This Court also has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1085 of the

16 Code of Civil Procedure.

17 8. Venue for this action properly lies in Kern County Superior Court because the
18 causes of action alleged in this Petition arose in Kern County, the Project is located in Kern

19 County and the environmental effects of the Project will be felt in Kern County.

PROJECT 20

21 9. On October 21, 2020, the City adopted the "Urban Hens Ordinance." The City
22 described the Project as an "ordinance by the Bakersfield City Council to allow hens (female
23 chickens of the subspecies Gallus gallus domesticus), but not roosters (males chickens of the
24 same subspecies) within areas of the City zoned as R-1 (One Family Dwelling), R-S (Residential
25 Suburban), RH (Residential Holding), and A (Agricultural). The sole purpose of a hen is for egg
26 laying and/or pet companionship."
27 10. This action arises under CEQA and its implementing regulations, which are
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 prescribed by the Secretary of the California Resources Agency to be followed by all state and
2 local agencies when undertaking projects subject to CEQA. (Pub. Resources Code§ 21000 et
3 seq.; Cal, Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.) This Court has jurisdiction over the matters
4 alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, and Public Resources
5 Code section 21168.5. In the alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil
6 Procedure section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code section 21168.
7 11. Members of Petitioner and other interested persons made oral and written

8 comments on the Project and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition.
PROJECT BACKGROUND, ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND APPROVAL

10 12. In 2011, the Bakersfield Municipal Code was amended to allow the keeping of

8 11 poultry or fowl only in agricultural and residential suburban zones, with minimum lot size of d11 'dnoJo ME] |3uueud • LZ06 A10S  P AISI M SI M A R O O 'SIl!H Aueneg 12 24,000 square feet, provided they are securely enclosed in a yard or pen.
13 13. In 2012, the City Council made a referral to explore if residents should own
14 | chickens in other residential zones. In November 2012, the Legislative and Litigation Committee
15 approved a motion to present an ordinance to the City Council that would allow City residents to
16 keep chickens only after receiving approval from the Planning Director. However, the topic was
17 revisited by the Committee in April 2013, and concerns were raised related to odors, free-ranged
18 chickens, noise and code enforcement. The Committee voted to deny the previously proposed
19 options for a chicken ordinance, and to keep current ordinance as is.
20 14. Chickens are currently permitted in three zone districts within the City, which are
21 those that permit farming or other agricultural-type uses (R-S, RH and A), as follows:
22 R-S (Residential Suburban) Zone: Minimum lot size of 24,000 square feet; allows for breeding, hatching, raising and keeping of poultry, fowl, rabbits, chinchillas,
23 Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs, fish, frogs and becs for the domestic use of the resident/occupant of the lot. 24 RH (Residential Holding) Zone: Minimum lot size of 20 acres; allows breeding, hatching and raising of poultry and fowl. 25 A (Agricultural) Zone: Hatching, raising and fattening of chickens, turkeys, or other
26 fowl, or poultry or rabbits, fish or frogs for domestic or commercial use; provided, that no commercial poultry pen or coop or commercial rabbitry shall be maintained 27 on a building site containing an area of less than one acre.

28 15. Currently, where poultry or fowl are allowed by zoning, they must be contained in

4

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

2 unlawful for any person to keep or have under their care, custody or control, either as owner or 1 a yard or pen (cannot roam freely). The code states: "Keeping Prohibited Exception: It is

3 otherwise, any chickens, ducks, geese, or poultry or fowl of any kind whatsoever, within the city,
4 unless same are kept securely enclosed in a yard or pen at all times and that the property is
5 within an agricultural zone or residential suburban zone."

16. The City Council conducted a workshop on August 12, 2020 to consider the
7 Project. Thereafter, the City conducted a public hearing and first reading of the Ordinance on 6

Ordiannce was then conducted on October 21, 8 September 23, 2020. A second reading of the
2020. At this final hearing, the City determined that the Project was exempt from CEQA and

10 then adopted the Ordinance. The City determined that the Ordinance was exmept pursuant to

11 CEQA Guidelines Section 15306 (Information Collection) and 15061(b)(3) (Common Sense). 8 d11'dnoio Mel jeuueus 17. The Notice of Exemption prepared by the City stated the following as the the •LZ06 12

8 e}nS "pAla eJJySI!M €8€8 13 rationale for the exemption: "There is no possibility that this project would have a significant
SIl!H AUeAS on the environment because it consists of basic data collection, research, experimental
15 management, and resource evaluation activities, which do not result in a serious or major 14 effect

16 disturbance to an environmental resource. This ordinance is strictly for information gathering
17 purposes, or as part of a study leading to an action which a public agency has not yet approved,
18 adopted, or funded; therefore, the project is not subject to CEQA." The Ordinance will go into

22 keeping of hens. In fact, the City's own Staff Report for the Workshop conducted on August 12, 21 oral and written evidence outlining the significant environmental impacts associated with the

23 2020 outlined such impats. The Staff Report listed the following "cons" associated with the
24 Ordinance:

25 Sanitation; must be kept clean (odors and flies)
Noise (roosters), but some may object to noises from hens (research from discussions
26 about chickens note that some dominant hens will also crow)
May attract rodents (from feed and manure) Health concerns (c-coli and salmonella) 27 Vulnerable by predators (cats, small birds of prey)
28 Chicks can be difficult to sex (not all chicks are sold as hens)

1 Respiratory diseases can easily spread to all confined birds (and other nearby birds)
19. The Staff Report from August 12, 2020 went on to state the following: "[I]n a 2

3 USA Today article released on July 30th, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
advised that, 'Chicks and ducklings kept in backyards are the likely source of a nationwide

5 Salmonella outbreak that has sickened nearly 1,000 people and killed one person.' The report

6 continued by advising that, "Reported cases have grown four-fold in a matter of days, increasing

7 from 212 last Friday to 938 Tuesday. Sick people range in age from 1 to 94-years-old, and more

8 than 150 people have been hospitalized.' Thus, there is the potential for negative impacts to

9 accompany an allowance for chickens in urbanized areas."

20. The Staff Report from August 12, 2020 outlined code enforcement issues as well 10

11 (many of which have environmental components). The following list of code enforcement issues
§ d'11 'dn0J9 MET jeuueyd were provided: +IZ06 LR T PINLES P H S IDNG S CO 'SIl!H AUeAg 12
Increased number of calls; insufficient Code Enforcement Officers
peace 13 In certain situations, will require the involvement of Police Officers to keep the
Noise (roosters) 14 Chickens not properly contained in coop/yard (allowed to free range)
15 People stating that if they wanted to live next to chickens, they would have purchased a home in a rural area (they chose to live in the City away from farm animals) 16 Chickens let loose in parks or other public areas
17 Expired chickens improperly disposed (river, canal, empty lots, side of road, etc.)
Social outcry where roosters are removed from homes where members of the household
18 have become attached to the animal (considered a pet)
Increased complaints if chickens are unsecured and encroach into other property 19 21. The Staff Report's concluded stating: "[S]taff believes allowing chickens to be
20 kept in urban residential zones "by right" has a very definite potential for problems, issues, and
21 complaints to be generated that would be disproportionate to the benefits. Urban chickens have
22 the potential for added cost and burden to the Code Enforcement department, where that resource
23 could be better utilized elsewhere. In comparison, requiring a fee-permitting system and
24 establishing provisions for the keeping of chickens may reduce the potential impacts on City
25 resources and staff. In conclusion, staff believes the City's interests would be best served by
26 protecting the peace, quiet, and quality of life issues that are of paramount concern for single-
27 family neighborhoods, while noting that there are current provisions for the keeping of chickens

1 within the City."

2 22. The City also received a detailed letter from the Bakersfield Association of
3 Realtors ("Association") objecting to the approval of the Project without conducting
4 environmental review under CEQA. The Association explained to the City that the Ordinance
5 would create noise, odor and spread of disease. The Association further explained that the
6 Ordinance had the potential to cause a direct or indirect physical change to the environment.
7 23. The City also received a published article from the Journal of Community Health
8 dated January 25, 2018 entitled "A Method for Guarding Animal Welfare and Public Health:
Tracking the Rise of Backyard Poultry Ordinances. " The article outlined a variety of documental
10 environmental consequences deriving from ordinances such as the Project.
11 24. The City filed a Notice of Exemption ("Notice") with the Kern County Recorder 3 Channel Law Group, LLP •LZ06 12 on October 23, 2020. This lawsuit has been brought within 35 days of the filing of the Notice of

E ezns "PAE BIJUSI!M €8€8 13 with the Kern County Recorder.
SIIIH Áueg 14 CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS
15 25. California Environmental Quality Act is California's broadest environmental
16 law. CEQA helps to guide public agencies such as the City during issuance of permits and
17 approval of projects. Courts have interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest protection of the
18  environment within the reasonable scope of the statutes. CEQA applies to all discretionary
19 projects proposed to be conducted or approved by a City, including private projects requiring
20 discretionary government approval. See California Public Resources Code, sections 21000 -
21 21178, and Title 14 Cal. Code Regs., section 753, and Chapter 3, sections 15000 - 15387
22 26. "CEQA broadly defines a 'project' as "an activity which may cause either a direct
23 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the
24 environment, and ... that involves the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate,
25 or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies.' [Citation.] The statutory definition
26 is augmented by the [CEQA] Guidelines [Cal.Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.], which define
27 a 'project' as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a direct
28

1 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the
2 environment...."* Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Sonora
3 (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1222, 66 Cal.Rptr.3d 645 (Tuolumne County). This includes all
4 phases of a project that are reasonably foreseeable, and all related projects that are directly linked
5 to the project. (CEQA Guidelines section 15378).

6 27. A strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an Environmental
7 Impact Report ("EIR") is built into CEQA which is reflected in what is known as the "fair
argument" standard, under which an agency must prepare an EIR whenever substantial evidence
in the record supports a fair argument that a project may have a significant effect on the
10 environment. No Oil, Inc. V. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 75, 82; Friends of "B" St.
11 v. City of Haywood (1980) 106 Cal.App.3d 988, 1002. ® d11 5dnoJo MET jeuueua LIZ06 12 28. "The EIR is the primary means of achieving the Legislature's considered LA0 MPANE LH ASID N OSE SIIIH ALeAg 13 declaration that it is the it policy of this state to 'take all action necessary to protect, rehabilitate,
14 and enhance the environmental quality of the state.' [Citation.] The EIR is therefore 'the heart of
15 CEQA.' [Citations.] An EIR is an 'environmental "alarm bell" whose purpose it is to alert the
16 public and its responsible officials to environmental changes before they have reached ecological 17| points of no return." Laurel Heights Improvement Assn. V. Regents of University of California
18 (1988) 47 Cal.3d 376, 392.
19 29. Under CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, if a project is not exempt and may cause
20 a significant effect on the environment, the agency must prepare an EIR. PRC §§ 21100, 21151;
21 14 Cal. Code Regs. §15064(a)(1), (f)(1). "Significant effect upon the environment" is defined as
22 'a substantial or potentially substantial adverse change in the environment." PRC §21068; 14 Cal
23 Code Regs §15382. A project "may" have a significant effect on the environment if there is a
24 "reasonable probability" that it will result in a significant impact. No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los
25 Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68, 83 n.16; Sundstrom v. County of Mendocino (1988) 202
26 Cal.App.3d 296, 309, 248 CR 352. This standard sets a "low threshold" for preparation of an
27 EIR. Pocket Protectors v. City of Sacramento (2004) 124 Cal.App. 4th 903, 928; Bowman v. City

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 4 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act)
5 30. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this
6 Petition.
7 31. The City determined that the Project was exempt from CEQA Guidelines Section
see with 8 15061(b)(3). The common sense exemption is applicable only when a public agency can
certainty that there is no possibility that a project may have a significance effect on the
10 Ienvironment. As the court in Myers v. Board of Supervisors (1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 413, 425, has
11
8 observed, this exemption should be reserved for those "obviously exempt" projects, "where its MET jeuueyo Group, LLP -LZ06 12 ouns "pAla eulysI!M €8€8 absolute and precise language clearly applies."
13 8 32. The initial burden of demonstrating that the common-sense exemption is
SIlH AHeseg 14 applicable rests with the City. As explained in Davidon, "In the case of the common sense
15 exemption [] the agency's cxemption determination is not supported by an implied finding by the
16 Resources Agency that the project will not have a significant environmental impact. Without the
17 benefit of such an implied finding, the agency must itself provide the support for its decision
18 before the burden shifts to the challenger. Imposing the burden on members of the public in the
19 first instance to prove a possibility for substantial adverse environmental impact would frustrate
20 CEQA's fundamental purpose of ensuring that government officials "make decisions with
21 environmental consequences in mind."
22 33. As explained in Davidon, the "showing required of a party challenging an
23 exemption under common sense exemption is slight, since that exemption requires the agency to
24 be certain that there is no possibility the project may cause significant environmental impacts. If
25 legitimate questions can be raised about whether the project might have a significant impact and
26 there is any dispute about the possibility of such an impact, the agoncy cannot find with certainty
27 that a project is exempt." 54 Cal. App. 4th at 117 (emphasis added). Further, claims raised by
28

9

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 opponents "even if exaggerated or untrue" may be sufficient to remove a project from the
2 common sense exemption. Myers V. Board of Supervisors (1976) 58 Cal.App.3d 413. A
3 petitioner must simply offer a reasonable argument to suggest a possibility that a project may
4 cause a significant environmental impact. Once that occurs, a public agency must refute that
a claim to a certainty before finding that the common sense exemption applies. Davidon Homes v.
City of San Jose (1997) 54 Cal. App. 4th 106, 118 (emphasis added). In Davidon, the

7 homebuilder simply argued that the activity in question "would result in noise, dust, and visual
8 impacts on surrounding residents, wildlife and plantlife" and that was deemed adequate. Id. at
118-120. The court held that the City had failed to refute these claims to a certainty rendering
10 the common sense exemption inapplicable. Id. at 120.
11 34. In this case, Respondent has failed to refute the claims of environmental impacts 8 d71 'dnoJg Law [ouueus -LZ06 LA0S VPANLS HSUON SCR SI!H ÁueAea 12 raised by members of the public during the course of the administrative proceedings to a
13 certainty in order for the common sense exemption to apply. Issues of noise, odor and diseases
14 remain.

15 35. The City also determined that the Project was exempt from CEQA Guidelines
16 Section 15306. The Class 6 exemption consists of "basic data collection, research, experimental
17 management, and resource evaluation activities which do not result in a serious or major
18 disturbance to an environmental resource. These may be strictly for information gathering
19 purposes, or as part of a study leading to an action which a public agency has not yet approved,
20 adopted, or funded." The City claimed in the Notice of Exemption as follows: "There is no
21 possibility that this project would have a significant effect on the environment because it consists
22 of basic data collection, research, experimental management, and resource evaluation activities,
23 which do not result in a serious or major disturbance to an environmental resource. This
24 | ordinance is strictly for information gathering purposes, or as part of a study leading to an action
25 which a public agency has not yet approved, adopted, or funded; therefore, the project is not

consist of the mere collection of information or a study leading to the action not yet approved.
2 Rather, it a zoning ordinance that authorize a use that was otherwise prohibited.
3 37. In determining whether a project meets the requirements of a categorical
exemption, the courts apply the rule that exemptions must be narrowly construed and that the
5 scope of the exemptions should not be unreasonably expanded. Wildlife Alive V. Chickering

7 Cal.App.3d 1136 (exemption not upheld). Categorical exemptions must be construed in light of 6 (1976) 18 Cal.3d 190, 205 (claim of exemption rejected); McQueen v. Bd. of Dirs. (1988) 202

8 their statutory authorization, which limits such exemptions to classes of projects that have been
determined not to have a significant effect on the environment. Azusa Land Reclamation Co. V.
10 Main San Gabriel Basin Watermaster (1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 1165, 1192. Strict construction
ensures that categorical exemptions are interpreted in a manner affording the greatest 8 d71 'dnoJo MET leuueus -LZ06 OINS "PALE EJJYSIIM E8€8 12 environmental protection within the reasonable scope of their language. Save Our Sch. v. 11

8 13|| Barstow Unified Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. (2015) 240 Cal.App.4th 128, 140; Cnty. of Amador v. El
'SI!H Auereg 14 Dorado Cnty. Water Agency (1999) 76 Cal.App.4th 931, 966. When a court is interpreting the
15 scope of a categorical exemption, the court is considering a "question of law." Walters v. City of
16| Redondo Beach (2016) 1 Cal.App.5th 809, 817; San Francisco Beautiful v. City & Cnty. of San
17 Francisco (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 1012, 1021; Robinson v. City & Cnty. of San Francisco (2012)

20 1251.

21 38. For the aforementioned reasons, Respondent committed a prejudicial abuse of
22 discretion and failed to proceed in a manner required by law by failing to consider Petitioner's
23 appeal and conduct the required additional environmental analysis under CEQA before
24 approving the Project.
