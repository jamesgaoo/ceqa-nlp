1 TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA:

2 PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21167.7, that on
3 December 11, 2020, Petitioner, SIERRA CLUB, filed a Verified Petition for Peremptory Writ
4 of Mandate (*Petition") pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA")
5 challenging the approval by Respondent, CITY OF FONTANA ("the City"), of the Fontana

6 Foothills Commerce Center project ("the Project").

7 a The Project is described as a proposal for the construction and operation of two

8 industrial warehouse logistics buildings, totaling 754,408 square feet, on approximately 33.55

9 acres at the intersection of Juniper Avenue and Jurupa Avenue in the City of Fontana, in San

10 Bernardino County. The buildings are anticipated to operate as warehouse logistics centers,

11 meaning that trucks traveling from distant locations such as the Ports of Long Beach and Los

12 Angeles will bring cargo to the warehouse buildings for storage and sorting for transport on

13 other trucks to destinations in and outside California. Because the site is designated and zoned

14 for residential uses, the Project required a general plan amendment and zone change. The site is

15 adjacent to, and surrounded on three sides, by existing residences. Indeed, existing homes are

16 located within 100 feet of the Project and its intense truck activity. The Project's Environmental
Impact Report ("EIR") concludes the Project will generate significant air quality, greenhouse
17 gas emission, and transportation impacts. The City approved the Project in spite of these
18 significant impacts.
19 The Petition alleges the City failed to comply with CEQA in certifying the EIR for the
20 Project. Among other deficiencies, the EIR fails to include mitigation measures to address the
21 Project's significant air quality and greenhouse gas emission impacts including measures set
22 forth in the City's 2015-2035 General Plan Update.
23 For the reasons alleged in the Petition (transmitted herewith), the decisions approving
24 the Project and certifying the Project's EIR must be overturned.

2 INTRODUCTION

3

4 1. On November 10, 2020, the City of Fontana ("the City") approved the Fontana

5 Foothills Commerce Center Project ("the Project")--a massive warehouse

6

7 development located immediately adjacent to single-family homes and near schools.

8 The City also approved a final environmental impact report ("EIR") that purports to,

9 but fails to, analyze and mitigate the widespread impacts of the Project's vast

10 operations. The Project's location So close to residences - within 100 feet in some

11

12 instances -- conflicts with the policy of the California Air Resources Board ("CARB")

13 that warehouse distribution facilities shall not be located within 1,000 feet of such

sensitive receptors.
14

15 2. This action challenges the City's approval of the Project, including certification of a

16 Final Environmental Impact Report (SCH #2020040155), General Plan Amendment

17

18 No.19-0007, Specific Plan Amendment No. 19-000011, General Plan Amendment

19 No. 20-009, Zone Change No. 20-008, Zone Change No. 19-0005, Design Review

20 No. 19-036, Tentative Parcel May 19-000018, and Development Agreement No.

21 20-002 and all related land use approvals (collectively, "the Project").

22

23 3. The City's certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") must be

24 vacated because the EIR fails to comply with the California Environmental Quality

25 Act ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.) in a number of material

26 ways, including that the City failed to adopt all feasible mitigation and alternatives

27

28 for the Project's significant environmental impacts namely air quality, greenhouse

gas emissions and traffic impacts. The decision to approve the Project without

-2-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1

2 imposing all feasible mitigation and alternatives is contrary to CEQA's "substantive

A W mandate" that the lead agency for a project subject to CEQA shall not approve a

project with significant impacts where feasible mitigation or alternatives exist to

reduce the impacts.

6 4. During the administrative review process, interested parties and members of the

7

8 community notified the City that there was need for further analysis and mitigation

9 due to the Project's adverse environmental effects. In spite of these reasoned

10 comments in the record, the City approved the Project and certified the Final EIR.

11 5. By this verified petition, Petitioner alleges the following:

12 PARTIES

13

14 6. Petitioner, Sierra Club, is a national nonprofit organization of more than three million

15 members. Sierra Club is dedicated to exploring, enjoying, and protecting the wild

16 places of the earth; to practicing and promoting the responsible use of the earth's

17

18 ecosystems and resources; to educating and encouraging humanity to protect and

19 restore the quality of the natural and human environment; and to using all lawful

20 means to carry out these objectives. The San Gorgonio Chapter of the Sierra Club

21 advocates for the interests of the southern California area particularly San Bernardino

22

23 and Riverside counties. The members of the San Gorgonio Chapter live, work, and

24 recreate in and around the areas that will be directly affected by the operation of the

25 Project. Sierra Club submitted extensive comments to the City throughout its

26 environmental review process for the Project that are part of the City's record of its

27 decision to approve the Project and its Final EIR.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 STATEMENT OF FACTS

2 The Project

3 15. The Project is described as a proposal for the construction and operation of two
4 industrial warehouse logistics buildings, totaling 754,408 square feet, on
5

6 approximately 33.55 acres of land at the intersection of Juniper Avenue and Jurupa

7 Avenue in the City of Fontana, in San Bernardino County. To comply with Senate

8 Bill 330, the Project also includes the approval of an "upzone" of 13.76 acres of
9 land at the southwest corner of Merrill Avenue and Catawba Avenue from single-
10

11 family residential to medium density residential. The Project does not propose the

12 construction of any physical housing units at the "upzone" property.

13 16. The Project's Building 1 would be 432,569 square feet with 57 dock doors and

14 Building 2 would be 321,839 square feet with 45 dock doors. Buildings will be up
15

16 to 60 feet in height. The Project includes 337 passenger vehicle parking spaces and

17 152 trailer parking spaces. Vehicle access to the Project site will be provided by

18 four driveways including driveways on Jurupa Avenue. Single-family homes are
19 located on the south side of Jurupa Avenue.
20

21 17. The Project is expected to operate 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Although

22 no building tenants have been identified according to the EIR, the Project will

23 function as a high-cube/logistics warehouse facility(ies) for storage, distribution,

24 and goods-movement. As such, the Project is a truck-intensive use. The EIR
25

26 concludes the Project will generate 1,058 actual daily vehicle trips including 342

27 actual diesel truck trips; the Project generates a daily total of 1,644 passenger car

28 equivalent ("PCE") vehicle trips. To calculate transportation impacts, including

-6-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 impacts associated with heavy duty truck trips, the EIR assumes a certain

2 distribution of truck trips on certain area roadways; but the Project's trucks are not
3 limited to these roadways or designated truck routes in the manner assumed by the
4
EIR's transportation analysis.
5

6 18. The City of Fontana General Plan Update 2015-2035 ("City of Fontana General

7 Plan") designates the site for residential and "mixed use" development. 28.92 acres

8 of the Project site is designated Residential - Planned Community (R-PC) and 4.63
9 acres are designated Walkable Mixed-Use Downtown and Corridors (WMXU-1).
10

11 The later land use designation is intended to develop properties with "mixed uses"

12 in part to reduce vehicle miles traveled ("VMT") by creating opportunities for

13 residents to work, shop, and live in the same neighborhood. To allow for the
14

15 proposed industrial-scale warehouse uses, the Project requested and received a

16 general plan amendment to designate the entire property as General Industrial (I-G).

17 19. The Project site is also zoned for residential uses. The site is zoned Residential -

18 Planned Community (R-PC) and Form Based Code (FBC). To allow for the
19 proposed warehouse uses, the Project requested and received specific plan zoning -
20

21 namely an amendment of the Southwest Industrial Park (SWIP) Specific Plan to

22 expand the boundaries of the SWIP to encompass the Project site. With respect to

23 the SWIP, the City of Fontana General Plan, Land Use Element, states under Goal 5
24 that: "[h]igh-quality job-producing industrial uses are concentrated in a few
25

26 locations where there is casy access to regional transportation routes"; Goal 5,

27 Action A states: "[e]xtend industrial land uses along I-10 as shown in the Future

28 Land Use Map"; and Goal 5, Action B states: "[d]irect new industrial development

-7.
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

to SWIP in order to build out this area designated for industrial development."

2 However, rather than locating industrial uses along the I-10 Corridor and within the
3 boundaries of the SWIP, the Project requested a zoning change to expand the
4 boundaries of the SWIP to push industrial development into an area designated for 5

6 residential development. An examination of the SWIP land use map shows that

7 heavy industrial uses, such as the Project, are intended, as affirmed in the City of

8 Fontana General Plan's land use map, to be located along the Interstate 10 Corridor
9
away from residences.
10

11 20. Indeed, the closest existing residences to the Project site are located 15 feet to the

12 east, 86 feet to the west, and 134 feet to the south. Surrounding existing land uses

13 generally include single-family residential homes and vacant land to the east;
14 single-family residential homes to the south; and single-family residential homes, a
15

16 church, and logistics warehouse complexes (existing and future) to the west.

17 21. Areas to the north, south, and west of the Project site consist of residential land use

18 designations as well. Surrounding areas are designated R-PC and WMXU-1 under
19 the City of Fontana General Plan.
20

21 22. The Project includes the following land use approvals:

22 a) General Plan Amendment No. 19-000007 changing the General Plan

23 Land Use Designations of the site from R-PC/WMXU-1 to General
24 Industrial (I-G).
25

26 b) Specific Plan Amendment (SPA 19-000011) to amend the SWIP Specific

27 Plan Land Use Plan and expand the SWIP boundary to include the

28 Project's development site.

-8-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

c) Zone Change (ZCA 19-000005) to amend the Zoning District Map to

2 change the zoning designation for all parcels in the Project's

3 development site from R-PC and FBC-Transitional to Specific Plan
4 (Southwest Industrial Park/SWIP).
5

6 d) Design Review (DPR 19-000036) to approve the specific development

7 plan, including a physical site layout, architectural design, and

8 landscaping plan for the Project's development site to include two
9 warehouse and distribution buildings, among other infrastructure and
10

11 improvements.

12 e) Tentative Parcel Map (TPM 19-000018) to consolidate all 12 parcels on

13 the Project's development site and re-subdivide the site into two legal
14 parcels.
15

16 f) A Development Agreement between the City and the Project

17 Applicant(s) pursuant to Cal. Gov't Code Sections 65864-65869.5.

18 g) Zone Change (ZCA 20-008) to amend the Zoning District Map to change
19 the zoning of 13.76 acres of land at the "upzone site" from R-1 to R-2 to
20

21 offset the potential loss of housing units resulting from the Zone Change

22 for the Project's development site.

23 h) General Plan Amendment (GPA 20-009) to amend the existing land use
24 designation for all parcels within the "upzone site" from R-SF to R-M.
25

26 CEQA Review and Project Approval

27 23. The City circulated a Draft EIR for public review and comment pursuant to CEQA

28 on or about August 11, 2020. The Draft EIR finds that the Project will result in

-9-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

significant and unavoidable environmental impacts in the areas of air quality

2 (project-level and cumulative nitrous oxide [NOx] emissions and consistency with

3 applicable air quality plan); greenhouse gas emissions (project-level and cumulative
4
GHG emissions and consistency with an applicable GHG reduction plan); and
5

6 transportation/traffic (project-level and cumulative vehicle miles traveled).

7 24. The Project's Final EIR was completed pursuant to CEQA in or about October

8 2020.

9
25. On or about October 20, 2020, the City of Fontana Planning Commission held a
10

11 public hearing and voted to recommend approval of the Project to the City of

12 Fontana City Council.

13 26. On or about October 26, 2020, the City purported to prepare a Supplemental Errata
14 to the Fontana Foothills Commerce Center Final EIR.
15

16 27. On November 10, 2020, the City of Fontana City Council considered and voted to

17 approve the Project at a public hearing, including certification of the Final EIR as

18 well as adoption of Findings of Fact, a Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting
19 Program, and a Statement of Overriding Considerations pursuant to CEQA.
20

21 1S 28. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the City posted the

22 NOD pursuant to CEQA on November 12, 2020.

23 29. The City's approval of the Project will cause Petitioner irreparable injury
24 for which Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law. Petitioner and its members will
25

26 be irreparably harmed by the City's actions in approving the Project. Petitioner was

27 harmed by, among other things, the failure of the City in its certification of the EIR

28 to adequately evaluate the potential impacts of the Project, and the City's approval

-10-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

of the Project without providing adequate and effective mitigation measures

2 contrary to the requirements of State law.

3 30. The maintenance of this action is for the purpose of enforcing important public
4

5 policies of the State of California with respect to the protection of the environment

6 under CEQA and conformance with state law and local law. The maintenance and

7 prosecution of this action will confer a substantial benefit upon the public by

8 protecting the public from environmental and other harms alleged in this Petition.
9

10 Petitioner is acting as a private attorney general to enforce these public policies and

11 prevent such harm.

12 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

13 31. This Court has jurisdiction to issue writs of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure
14 Section 1094.5.
15

16 32. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure Sections 393 and

17 394 as the Project is located in, and the relevant events occurred in San Bernardino

18 County.
19 33. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing the action by complying
20

21 with the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.5, in notifying Respondent

22 of the filing of this action (attached hereto as Exhibit "A"), and by complying with

23 the requirements of Public Resources Code § 21167.6, in notifying Respondent of
24 Petitioner's election to prepare the record of Respondent proceedings in connection
25

26 with this action (attached hereto as Exhibit "B").

EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

2 34. During the Project's administrative review process, Sierra Club commented to the

3 City that the Project would result in potentially significant impacts to/from
4
including, but not limited to: air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, land use, noise,
5

6 traffic and others. Petitioner commented the EIR was legally inadequate; further

7 mitigation was required; and project alternatives were feasible and must be adopted.

8 35. As a result of these comments in the record, Petitioner Sierra Club exhausted its

9 administrative remedies within the meaning of Public Resources Code § 21177. 10

11 CAUSE OF ACTION

12 (Writ of Mandate)

13 (All parties did not comply with the requirements of CEQA.)
14 36. Petitioner hereby realleges and incorporates paragraphs 1 through 35 above as
15

16 though set forth in full herein.

17 37. The California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") (Public Resources Code §

18 21100 et seq.), enacted in 1971, requires government agencies to consider the
19 environmental consequences of their actions before approving projects subject to
20

21 CEQA's provisions.

22 38. The Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") is considered "the heart" of CEQA. To

23 effectuate the Legislature's goals of environmental protection, CEQA provides that
24 an adequate EIR must evaluate all potentially significant environmental impacts of a
25

26 proposed project including both direct and indirect impacts as well as cumulative

27 impacts. (State CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15126, 15126.2 (a), 15130.)

28

-12-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

39. Petitioner and others commented that the EIR fails to adequately evaluate impacts

2 to/from including, but not limited to, air quality, energy, greenhouse gas emissions,

3 land use, noise, and traffic. By way of example, Petitioner commented extensively
4

5 that the EIR improperly ignores and the Project is inconsistent with the policies of

6 the City of Fontana General Plan related to increasing renewable energy insofar as

7 the Project does not include any solar/PV power. By way of further example, the

8 EIR improperly ignores and the Project is inconsistent with the policies of the City
9

10 of Fontana General Plan related to meeting the State of California's Greenhouse

11 Gas Emission ("GHG") reduction targets. For instance, the City has failed to require

12 the Project to reduce VMT through enforceable measures that serve to decrease

13 reliance on vehicle use.

14

15 40. CEQA establishes a substantive mandate on the part of the lead agency to mitigate

16 the significant environmental impacts of a project. (Public Resources Code §

17 21002, 21002.1; State CEQA Guidelines, § 15021 (a).) A lead agency may not

18 approve a project for which there are significant environmental impacts unless the
19
agency makes findings that: (a) mitigation measures have been required of the
20

21 project which avoid or substantially lessen the significant environmental impacts, or

22 (b) mitigation measures are found to be infeasible based on substantial evidence.

23 (Public Resources Code §§ 21081, 21081.5; State CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15091
24 (a)(b), 15092 (b).)
25

26 41. Petitioner commented extensively that the Project fails to adopt all feasible

27 mitigation including mitigation to reduce air quality, greenhouse gas emission,

28 energy, and land use impacts. Petitioner proposed a number of feasible air quality

-13-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

mitigation measures to lessen significant impacts due to the Project. These feasible

2 measures were not adopted, and the City failed to demonstrate, based on substantial
evidence in the record, that the measures were infeasible. By way of example,
4 Petitioner proposed that the Project shall install electric vehicle ("EV") charging
5

6 stations to mitigate significant air quality and GHG impacts. The Project does not

7 adopt such a measure; instead, the Project is conditioned to comply with the State of

8 California Title 24 "CalGreen" requirement to provide EV charging spaces. The
9
Project does not require the installation of any physical charging units although
10

11 these are entirely feasible and are routinely installed and utilized by commercial and

12 industrial projects throughout southern California.

13 42. CEQA additionally provides that adopted mitigation measures must be certain and
14 enforceable. (Public Resources Code 21081.6(b); State CEQA Guidelines, §
15

16 15126.6(a)(2).) The lead agency must ensure that mitigation measures are required

17 by or incorporated into the project to ensure that the measures are actually carried

18 out. (Public Resources Code § 21081.6 (a), (b).)
19 43. Petitioner and others commented in the record that adopted mitigation measures are
20

21 not certain and enforceable. By way of example, the City added a mitigation

22 measure through a purported Supplemental Errata to the Final EIR stating that on-

23 site forklifts shall be powered by non-diesel or electricity "if technically feasible."
24 This is not adequate, certain, and enforceable mitigation because the language
25

26 allows the applicant or City to dispense with the measure as there are 1o standards

27 to determine "technical feasibility."

28

-14-
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

44. CEQA requires that the lead agency evaluate alternatives to the proposed project

2 that are environmentally superior to the proposed project. (State CEQA Guidelines,
3 § 15126.6 (a).) The lead agency has a duty to adopt a project alternative if it is
4

5 feasible. (Public Resources Code 21002) A lead agency may not reject an

6 alternative unless the agency makes findings supported by substantial evidence

7 showing that the alternative is infeasible. (Public Resources Code, 8§ 21081,

45. Petitioner and others commented that the City failed to demonstrate that the
10

11 Reduced Density Alternative evaluated through the EIR is infeasible based on

12 substantial evidence in the record. The Reduced Density Alternative would reduce

13 the size of the Project by approximately 1/3, resulting in fewer vehicle trips,
14 including heavy-duty diesel truck trips. As such the EIR determines that the
15

16 Reduced Density Alternative would eliminate the Project's significant air quality

17 (NOx) impact and substantially reduce the Project's significant GHG impacts. The

18 City improperly rejected this alternative insofar as the record lacks substantial
19 evidence, i.e., facts or data, demonstrating that the alternative is infeasible. While
20

21 the City Council Staff Report concludes the "alternative would achieve all of the

22 project objectives,' it is merely stated -- without evidence -- that the "reduced level

23 of benefit" associated with the Reduced Density Alternative renders it infeasible.
24 CEQA, however, requires that the record contain evidence of infeasibility of
25

26 alternatives. A lead agency may not reject an alternative unless the agency makes

27 findings supported by substantial evidence showing that the alternative is "truly"

28 infeasible. (Public Resources Code §§ 21081 (a), 21081.5; Guidelines, §§ 15091

U

4 46. An EIR must accurately describe the it project it analyzes. (State CEQA Guidelines,

5 §§ 15124, 15125.) An inaccurate or incomplete description of the proposed project

6 undermines CEQA's purposes, particularly where it minimizes the project's

7

8 environmental impacts. "An accurate, stable, and finite project description is the

sine qua
9 non of an informative and legally sufficient EIR." (County of Inyo v. City

10 of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal.App.3d 185, 192-93.) When an EIR gives "conflicting

11 signals to decision-makers and the public about the nature and scope of the activity

12

13 being proposed," the courts have found it "fundamentally inadequate and

14 misleading." (San Joaquin Raptor Rescue Cntr. v. Cnty of Merced (2007) 149

15 Cal.App.4th at 645, 655-56.) CEQA similarly requires analysis of the "whole of the

16 [project]." (State CEQA Guidelines, § 15378.) All phases of a project must be

17

18 considered in an EIR. (State CEQA Guidelines, § 15063 (a)(1); City of Antioch v.

19 City Council (1986) 187 Cal.App.3d 1325, 1334.) CEQA broadly defines a

20 "project" as "an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the

21 environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the

22

23 environment." (Public Resources Code, § 21065.) The purpose of this broad

24 construction is to "maximize environmental protection."(McQueen v. Board of

25 Directors (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1143.) If an EIR "does not 'adequately

26 apprise all interested parties of the true scope of the project for intelligent weighing

27

28 of the environmental consequences of the project,' informed decisionmaking cannot

I occur and "the final EIR is inadequate as a matter of law." (Communities for a

b Better Environment City of Richmond (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 70, 82-83, 98.)

4 47. Petitioner commented that the EIR's Project Description section is misleading and

5 incomplete where it states there would be no refrigerated uses associated with the

6 operation of the two warehouse buildings upon completion. This statement is

7

8 misleading and incomplete because the EIR indicates that the Project may entail

9 cold storage in the future, and in fact the Project's mitigation program purports to

10 permit an "amendment" to the land use entitlements to allow for cold storage.

11 Refrigerated uses/cold storage uses must be disclosed in the EIR Project

12

13 Description, and furthermore evaluated in the EIR, because refrigerated uses,

14 including the operation of truck Transportation Refrigeration Units ("TRUs") to

15 transport cold goods, will intensify the Project's impacts, including, but not limited

16 to, increasing localized air quality impacts. The absence of a complete analysis of

17

18 refrigerated uses renders the EIR deficient on an informational basis, and the

19 conclusions of the EIR are not based on substantial evidence without a full and

20 robust analysis of the utilization of cold storage. Regardless of the purported

21 "amendment" process, CEQA does not permit deferred and segmented analysis of

22

23 environmental issues within an EIR. As is cold storage is contemplated at the time of

24 Project approval, i.e., it is reasonably foreseeable at the time of Project approval,

25 these uses must be fully disclosed and evaluated in the EIR. If, as here, an EIR

26 "does not "adequately apprise all interested parties of the true scope of the project

27 for intelligent weighing of the environmental consequences of the project,'

28 informed decisionmaking cannot occur and "the final EIR is inadequate as a matter

-17-

of law." (Communities for a Better Environment City of Richmond (2010) 184

2 Cal.App.4th 70, 82-83, 98.)

3 48. For these reasons, the City violated CEQA and the EIR and Project approvals must
4
be set aside. (Code Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5; Public Resources Code § 21168.)

6 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

7 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays the following relief on all causes of action:

8 a) For the Court's peremptory writ of mandate requiring Respondent, City of
9 Fontana, to set aside its decision certifying the EIR and all Project approvals. 10

11 b) For such other and further relief, including preliminary and permanent

12 injunctive relief, in the event that a Real Parties in Interest, or their agents or

13 instrumentalities, intend to commence construction on the site while this
14 lawsuit is pending.
15

16 c For such other relief as may be just and proper.

17 d) For the costs of this suit, including attorney's fees, pursuant to Code of Civil

18 Procedure, § 1021.5.
