INTRODUCTION 1

2 1. Petitioner SHAFTER-WASCO IRRIGATION DISTRICT ("Petitioner" or

3 "SWID") brings this Petition for Writ of Mandamus and Complaint for Injunctive Relief

4 ("*Petition") against Respondent KERN-TULARE WATER DISTRICT ("Respondent" or

5 "KTWD") to remedy KTWD's failure to properly evaluate the potentially significant

6 environmental impacts of renewing two water service contracts with the Bureau of Reclamation

7 (*Reclamation") and the California Department of Water Resources ("DWR"): Interim Renewal

8 Contract No. 14-06-200-8601A-IR18 and Interim Renewal Contract No. 14-06-200-8367A-IR18

9 (collectively, the "Project" or the "Renewal Contracts"), in violation of the California
JTT NOTHHOS HUHMVA LIVAH NIZISNMONA 10 Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA").

11 2. The Renewal Contracts provide that KTWD may via Reclamation obtain and
TILZ-TOTE6 VO 'RIEQIEA EIUES J00ld puz haang edeavuy tror 12 transport water from the Central Valley Project ("CVP") San Luis Unit and Delta Division

13 through the Cross Valley Canal, which connects the California Aqueduct to the Friant-Kern

14 Canal, as shown on the map on the following page.

15 3. The Friant-Kern Canal provides a major water delivery system to water users

16 throughout California's Central Valley. Water in the Friant-Kern Canal is high quality,

17 originating in the Sierra Mountains before flowing south to Millerton Lake, a reservoir on the San

18 Joaquin River. In contrast, water delivered through the Cross Valley Canal is generally

19 significantly higher in salts and other constituents. Accordingly, Cross Valley Canal deliveries,

20 such as those approved by Respondents, will degrade the quality of water in the Friant-Kern

21 Canal, resulting in numerous significant environmental impacts under CEQA.

25 4. Despite the potentially significant environmental impacts of Cross Valley Canal

26 deliveries to the Friant-Kern Canal, KTWD erroneously determined that the Renewal Contracts

27 were categorically exempt from CEQA under CEQA Guidelines Section 15301 because the

28 Renewal Contracts involved the delivery of water through existing facilities. KTWD also

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

P erroneously relied upon the statutory exemption for certain rate-setting activities pursuant to

2 CEQA Guidelines Section 15273. Moreover, KTWD approved the Renewal Contracts without

3 offering the public or affected stakeholders an opportunity to understand the basis for the claimed

4 CEQA exemptions.

5 5. Accordingly, SWID respectfully seeks a writ of mandate pursuant to Code of Civil

6 Procedure section 1085 (and in the alternative, Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5) requiring

7 KTWD to rescind, void, and vacate any and all motions and resolutions reflecting its approval of

8 the Project. These motions and resolutions include KTWD Resolution 2020-03: Authorizing

9 Execution of Interim Renewal Contract No. 14-06-200-8601A-IR18 and KTWD Resolution
dII 'XOTHHOS MHRAVA LIVAH NIMISNMOXH 10 2020-04: Authorizing Execution of Interim Renewal Contract No. 14-06-200-8367A-IR18.

11 6. SWID also prays for appropriate injunctive relief and a stay to prevent KTWD
IILZ-IOTE6 VO RIBQIPE RICES 1001d puz "139nS edesruy izol 12 from taking further actions to implement or proceed with the Project during the pendency of this

13 litigation and prior to complying with CEQA.

PARTIES 14

15 7. Petitioner SWID is California irrigation district organized and existing under and

16 pursuant to California's Irrigation District Law (Wat. Code, $§20500 et seq.). SWID's service

17 area includes approximately 38,766 acres, located in the southern area of the San Joaquin Valley

18 generally in the northwest quadrant of Kern County. SWID's service area includes the

Section 22650 to commence and maintain any action and proceeding to carry out its purposes or 19 incorporated cities of Wasco and Shafter. Petitioner is authorized pursuant to Water Code

20

21 protect its interests. Petitioner brings this action on behalf of itself and on behalf of the

22 landowners and water users within its boundaries.

23 8. Respondent KTWD is a California water district organized and existing under

24 California Water District Law (Wat. Code, §§34000 et seq.).

25 9. SWID is currently unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents ROES

26 through 10, inclusive, and therefore sues those parties by fictitious names. SWID will amend
when the same has been ascertained. 27 this Petition to allege their true names and capacities

JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 10. The Kern County Superior Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged herein

3 pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 526, 527, 1085, 1094.5 and Cal. Pub. Res. Code §§ 21168

4 and 21168.5.

5 11. Venue is appropriate in Kern County pursuant to Cal. Code Civ. Proc. §§ 393, 394

6 and 395 because Respondent is located within the County of Kern. Among other things,

7 Respondent's Project threatens prime agricultural farmland, landowners, water users, natural

8 resources, a common and interconnected groundwater basin, and the environment, all located

9 within the County of Kern.
BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 10 STANDING

11 12. SWID has a direct and substantial beneficial interest in KTWD's full and complete LILZ-LOIE6 VO *BI8QUEg BIUES 10014 puz '13911§ edroeuy IZOl 12 compliance with CEQA, and all other applicable laws, in approving the Renewal Contracts.

13 13. KTWD owed a mandatory duty to act within the boundaries of its legal authorities

14 under CEQA and all other applicable laws before exercising its discretion to approve the Renewal
15 Contracts and file the Notices of Exemption (NOEs).
16 14. SWID also has the right to enforce the public's right and duties that CEQA and all
17 other applicable laws impose on KTWD.

18 15, SWID has no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of
19 law, and will suffer irreparable injury unless this court issues the relief requested herein. SWID

20 has continuously maintained a public project for the diversion, delivery and use of water for the
21 beneficial use of irrigation for agricultural users within its boundaries. SWID, and its landowners

22 and water users, use surface water and groundwater existing in a common and interconnected

23 groundwater basin located north of Kern River for reasonable and beneficial use of irrigation, and
24 other purposes. KTWD's approval of the Renewal Contracts harms SWID, and its landowners

25 and water users, by threatening impairment of their reasonable and beneficial use of the common

26 and interconnected groundwater resources.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

2 16. SWID has repeatedly raised its concerns to KTWD regarding the water quality

3 impacts of introducing Cross Valley Canal water into the Friant-Kern Canal. KTWD's service

4 area and intake facilities are located north of SWID's, along the Friant-Kern Canal. In the past,

5 KTWD has sometimes used the Shafter Check (a major water pump used to lift water up

6 elevations) to create a "reverse" flow on the Friant-Kern Canal, conveying poorer quality Cross

7 Valley Canal water in a northerly direction, past SWID's intake facilities.

8 17. SWID has repeatedly explained to KTWD that introducing Cross Valley Canal

9 water into the Friant-Kern Canal impacts water quality and results in significant environmental
BROWNSTEIN d'TT'NOIHHOS MIHXVJ LIVAH 10 impacts. SWID has attempted repeatedly to engage KTWD in discussions about mitigation and

11 monitoring to ameliorate the water quality impacts of Cross Valley Canal water. SWID has
ITLZ-IOTE6 VO HEqIeg TILES 10018 puz 00ns ?deserry izot pump 12 sought, in multiple forums, to obtain more information about use of the Shafter Check to
13 Cross Valley Canal water past SWID's intake facilities. SWID's efforts have been rebuffed at

14 every turn by KTWD.

15 18. KTWD approved the Renewal Contracts at a special meeting held on February 26,

16 2020. Although the agenda for the February 26, 2020 special meeting mentioned the potential

17 filing of a notice of exemption for the Renewal Contracts, the agenda did not mention CEQA nor

18 did it give any indication of which categorical and/or statutory exemption KTWD intended to rely

19 upon, Besides the meeting agenda, no additional materials were available on KTWD's website -

20 not even the Renewal Contracts proposed to be executed, nor any explanatory staff report or

21 Board letter.

22 19. On Friday, February 21, 2020, SWID's special counsel, Doug Gosling, received an

23 email from KTWD's administrative assistant notifying him of KTWD's February 26, 2020

24 special meeting and attaching : copy of the agenda. Mr. Gosling responded by email requesting a

25 copy of the meeting packet and any agenda materials. On the morning of Monday, February 24,

26 2020, Mr. Gosling received an email from KTWD's Assistant General Manager without any

27 additional information and simply stating, "All materials will be made available pursuant to the

28

6

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

-

2 applicable provisions of the government code for special meetings." Mr. Gosling received no

3 other correspondence with additional materials prior to the February 26, 2020 meeting.

20.

4 Despite KTWD's refusal to provide any further materials associated with the

5 Project or the NOEs, SWID nonetheless submitted a comment letter on February 25, 2020

6 expressing concerns with degradation in water quality which would result in the Friant-Kern

7 Canal, impacting SWID and its customers, ifKTWD approved the contracts. Because SWID was

8 unable to obtain any additional information about the items to be discussed at KTWD's February

9

BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 26, 2020 meeting, SWID incorporated by reference a copy of SWID's prior December 12, 2019

10 letter to Reclamation concerning NEPA and CEQA issues with the Interim Renewal Contracts for

3001d puz 'yeeus edeoeuy TZOI 11 the Cross Valley Contractors (which included the Renewal Contracts approved by KTWD).

12 SWID's December 12, 2019 letter outlined specific water quality concerns with the Renewal

Barbara, 13 Contracts arising from the discharge of Cross Valley Canal water into the Friant-Kern Canal. The

14 letter also outlined potential environmental impacts that would result from the degradation in

15 water quality in the Friant-Kern Canal, including impacts to water quality. In particular, the letter

16 raised the concern that water from the Cross Valley Canal is significantly higher in salts

17 compared to water coming down the Friant-Kern Canal from Lake Millerton.

21.

18 When Mr. Gosling walked into the KTWD special meeting, he was handed a copy

19 of materials exceeding 250 pages. Neither Mr. Gosling nor any other SWID representative was

20 given an opportunity to review the Renewal Contracts or the claimed basis for the CEQA

21 exemptions until minutes before the meeting commenced. Mr. Gosling stated for the record that

22 he had not been given adequate time to offer comments on meeting materials provided to him or

23 the action that the agency planned to take. The facts alleged in paragraphs 19 through 20 above

are

24 set forth in the attached Declaration of Doug Gosling attached hereto and incorporated herein
by reference.

25 22.

26 Despite SWID being forced to comment on the Project without adequate notice or

27 information, the grounds for noncompliance with CEQA and other applicable laws alleged in the
Petition are consistent with the objections to the Project that SWID raised repeatedly in
28 conversations and correspondence with SWID for years, and again in its February 25, 2020 letter,

7
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated herein by reference. SWID

2 therefore sufficiently exhausted its administrative remedies to bring this action.

3 23. On February 26, 2020, KTWD's Board of Directors approved two resolutions

4 authorizing the execution of the Renewal Contracts and the "filing" of an NOE for each.

5 Although not disclosed to the public prior to its February 26, 2020 special meeting, KTWD relied

6 upon two CEQA exemptions in approving the Project without environmental review: the

7 categorical exemption for existing facilities pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section 15301 and the

8 statutory exemption for certain rate-setting activities pursuant to CEQA Guidelines Section

9 15273. The NOEs were posted with the Kern County Clerk office on March 2, 2020.
JTT'NOTIHOS HJAHVA JIVAH NIMISNMOHE 10 24. If any grounds for noncompliance with CEQA and other applicable laws alleged in this

11
TTLZ-101S6 VO BIBQIEA BIUPS 1021 Anacapa puz teans Floor reason, not raised prior to KTWD's February 26, 2020 approval of the Petition were, for some

12 Project, it was because there was no meaningful opportunity for members of the public to raise

13 those objections prior to the approval of the Project, because KTWD failed to give notice required

14 by law, and/or because any attempt to exhaust administrative remedies appears to be futile as

15 KTWD chose not provide the requested information prior to the meeting.

16 25. SWID has therefore exhausted its administrative remedies.

17 FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND
18 26. SWID has continuously maintained public facilities for the diversion, delivery and

19 use of water for the beneficial use of irrigation for agricultural users within its boundaries. In

20 2001, SWID secured a long-term (25-year) water service contract with Reclamation for CVP

21 water, entitling SWID to 50,000 acre-feet of Class I water and 39,600 acre-feet of Class II water.

22 SWID receives its CVP water primarily through its intake facilities on the Friant-Kern Canal.

23 27. Both Petitioner and Respondent have water delivery facilities to take water from

24 the Friant-Kern Canal for use within their service areas, but only Respondent has allocations of

25 CVP water from both the San Luis Unit/ Delta Division and the Friant Division. Respondent also

26 purchases other supplemental water supplies when available. Petitioner's only CVP allocation is
27 from the Friant Division.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 28. The Cross Valley Canal is a joint-use facility owned by various participants,

2 including Cross Valley Canal Contractors and Arvin-Edison Water Storage District. The Cross

3 Valley Canal can convey water from the California Aqueduct to the Kern Water Bank, the City of

4 Bakersfield groundwater recharge facility, the Berrenda Mesa Property, the Pioneer Banking

5 Project, the Kern River channel, to Arvin-Edison's Intake Canal, or to various member units of

6 Kern County Water Authority and other districts who have access to the Cross Valley Canal.

second 7 When needed, the Cross Valley Canal is also capable of conveying 500 cubic feet per

8 (cfs), in reverse flow-gravity mode, to the California Aqueduct. In 2008, as part of the Cross

9 Valley Canal expansion project, an additional 500 cfs turnout was constructed to provide 500 cfs
BROWNSTEIN HYATT FARBER SCHRECK, LLP 10 of flow between the Friant-Kern Canal and the Cross Valley Canal. From the Cross Valley Canal

11 1001J puz *1390S tdvoeuy 1ZOl water can be delivered to the Friant-Kern Canal through the use of a pumping lift. SWID is

12 informed and believes that KTWD brings water from the California Aqueduct into the Friant-
13 Kern Canal, past SWID's intake, through this pumping lift. *RIRqIeg BILES 14 29. SWID is informed and believes that KTWD's Project has the potential to degrade

15 Friant-Kern Canal supplies, at a minimum, by increasing sodium, chloride, and boron in the water

16 taken by SWID from the Friant-Kern Canal. SWID is required to work within a variety of State

17 of California regulatory programs, including the Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control

18 Board's Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program and the Central Valley Salinity Alternatives for

19 Long-Term Sustainability Program. The Project threatens to impair SWID's ability to comply
20 with its regulatory mandates under those programs.

21 30. Pursuant to the mandates of the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act

22 (*SGMA") a groundwater sustainability plan ("GSP") was adopted for the Kern County subbasin,

23 which SWID's service area overlies. SWID is a part of the Kern Groundwater Authority, which

24 adopted a GSP aimed at achieving SGMA's legal mandate of achieving "sustainability" by the

25 year 2040. This means that for the first time, the Kern County subbasin is being managed under a

26 state mandate to avoid six statutorily defined "undesirable results," including degraded

27 groundwater quality trends.

28

9

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 31. The potentially significant impacts to SWID's agricultural users and its water

2 management programs from the introduction of poor quality water into the Friant-Kern Canal at

3 or near SWID's turnout have never been addressed by KTWD. This is in spite of KTWD being

4 presented with laboratory test results during discussions about Friant-Kern Canal water quality.

5 32. SWID, as well as members of the general public, will suffer irreparable harm if the

6 relief requested herein is not granted and the Project is commenced.

7 33. SWID has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law to

8 redress the claims pleaded herein.

9 34. SWID has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
ITT'NOTAHOS HHAAVA LIVAH NIJISNMOHE 10 21167.5 by mailing a written notice of commencement of this action to Respondent prior to the
11 commencement of this suit, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit B.

13 required by Public Resources Code section 21167.7.

14 36. SWID hereby and by a separate election notifies KTWD that SWID elects to

15 prepare the record of proceedings relevant to the approval of the Project in compliance with

16 Public Resources Code section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2). A copy of such notice is filed

17 concurrently with this Petition.
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 18

19 [Violation of California Environmental Quality Act, PRC SS 21168, 21168.5 |

20 37. Petitioner incorporates by this reference paragraphs 1 through 35 as though they

21 were set forth in full herein.

22 38. KTWD determined that the Project was statutorily exempt from CEQA pursuant to

23 CEQA Guidelines Section 15273 and categorically exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA

24 Guidelines Section 15301.

25 39. The relied on exemptions do not apply to this Project. Neither the statutory or

26 categorical exemption was proper to rely on in these circumstances.

27 40. As to the statutory exemption, KTWD improperly determined that the Project is

28 exempt from CEQA on the basis of the statutory exemption for the "establishment, modification,

10
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- structuring, restructuring, or approval of rates, tolls, fares, and other charges by public agencies

2 which the public agency finds are for the purpose of .. . Meeting operating expenses, including

3 employee wage rates and fringe benefits." This exemption is inapplicable because the Renewal

4 Contracts include operational details of water service delivery that go beyond the establishment of

5 rates.

6 41. More problematic still for KTWD's claimed exemption, the Renewal Contracts do

7 not involve any "rates, tolls, fares, [or] other charges" imposed by KTWD. The fact that the

8 Renewal Contracts address certain payments owed by KTWD to Reclamation and DWR do not

9 transform the Renewal Contracts into the sort of rate-setting action contemplated by this statutory
d'TT 'XOINHOS MAIHVA LIVAH NIXISNMONA 10 exemption. This Project does not just involve setting a rate for customers to pay. This Project

11 expressly approves the transfer of water which will cause direct and indirect impacts on the TIZZ-10L€6 VO 'BIBQIUE B1UBS 1001d puz saans EdEOEuy IZOI 12 environment. A physical change to the environment will occur because of this Project because it

13 will significantly degrade the water quality in the Friant-Kern Canal. The statutory exemption for

14 rate setting therefore does not apply.

15 42. Pursuant to CEQA Guidelines section 15300.2, subdivision (c), "A categorical

16 exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity

17 will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.»

18 43. There are "unusual circumstances" concerning the Project arising from the fact

19 that the Renewal Contracts provide for the delivery of CVP water to KTWD via the Cross Valley

20 Canal, allowing for the introduction of water from the California Aqueduct into the Friant-Kern

21 Canal. The circumstances of this Reclamation service contract are unusual in that they involve

22 the use of existing and fixed conveyance infrastructure, but involve variable operations as to the
23 source of water conveyed. These unusual circumstances give rise to potentially significant

24 environmental impacts: as SWID has repeatedly expressed, the discharge of Cross Valley Canal

25 water into the Friant-Kern Canal has significant water quality impacts to SWID's surface and

26 groundwater irrigation supplies and associated adverse water quality impacts on soils and crops

27 within SWID's service area.

28

11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 44. SWID overlies a closed groundwater basin and the introduction of degraded water

2 supplies tend to accumulate in the groundwater and become worse over time. KTWD has tended

3 to rely upon Cross Valley Canal water pumped up the Friant Kern Canal during times of drought.

4 Currently, south-of-Delta agricultural water service contractors south are allocated only 15% of

5 their contract supply, and accordingly, it is anticipated that KTWD may rely heavily upon

6 deliveries of Cross Valley Canal water during the 2020-2022 time period, compared to existing

7 operations. Moreover, the increasing and unaddressed potential for water quality degradation has

8 become more pronounced with the adoption of a GSP for the Kern County subbasin in early 2020

9 and the legal imperative to manage groundwater to avoid undesirable results, including water
LLP 'HOTHHOS HIAHVA LIVAH NIMISNMONA 10 quality degradation.

11 45. The discharge of degraded water has impacts which worsen over time and now
LILZ-IOLE6 VD 'ZIZqIEE Santa 1001d puz gaans edeoeuy IZOl 12 threaten to have catastrophic and longstanding impacts on SWID's customers. There are 21,600

13 acres of almond trees within SWID's service area. The almond trees within SWID's service are

14 of a specific rootstock that is both particularly high-yield and especially sensitive to the quality of

15 applied water. The impacts of applying saltier water to almond trees now threatens to diminish

16 the viability of agricultural operations within SWID's service area, during the term of the 2020-

17 2022 Renewal Contracts.

18 46. The significant impacts and unusual circumstances described above make it

19 impossible for KTWD to rely on a categorical exemption to approve this water diversion. There

20 is more than a reasonable possibility under these circumstances that the Project will have a

21 significant effect on the environment. Accordingly, KTWD improperly determined that the

22 Project is categorically exempt from CEQA.

23 47. KTWD's improper determination that the Project is exempt from the provisions of

24 CEQA constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion.

Gentlemen:

We are in receipt of the above meeting notice. Although we have not received any other information on the above agenda items they appear to be the same subject that the Shafter- Wasco Irrigation District ("SWID") previously provided comments in the attached letter dated December 12, 2019. SWID has not changed its position in defending its water quality and will continue to defend against any reduction in the water quality it receives.

Very truly yours,

Re: Draft Environmental Assessment Central Valley Project Interim Renewal
Contracts for Cross Valley Contractors 2020-2022 Draft EA-19-044

The Shafter-Wasco Irrigation District ("SWID") has reviewed the above-entitled document per the Natiopal Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"), 42 U.S.C. $§ 4321 et seq., the Administrative Procedure Act ("APA"), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701 et seq., the Central Valley Project Improvement Act ("CVPIA"), Public Law 102 - 575, and the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq. The renewal of interim water service contracts was first evaluated in 1994 with supplemental
review with roll-over documents and now tiered documents to those previous reviews.

As you know, SWID receives water from the southerly portion of Friant Kern Canal. SWID outlets from the Friant Kern Canal ("FKC") are above the second to last check

Draft EA-19-044 Page 1 of 4

structure, the Shafter Check, on the FKC. Thus, SWID has had a long interest in the Bureau's actions and specifically with the actions of specific agencies contracting for the renewal of such cross valley project supplies. The above referenced project does not
specifically propose to pump water over the Shafter Check to facilitate reverse flow of
the FKC. There are exchanges referenced but said exchanges do not discuss specifically pumping water over the Shafter Check. We believe there is a compelling need for detailed evaluation of long-term and cumulative impacts of district-level water quality
the Shafter Check and consider NEPA and CEQA compliance issues when pumping over to be significant and desire to work with those agencies to resolve our concerns to avoid
further impacts.

SWID is concerned over the difference in water quality delivered to it. The Cross Valley Canal water is significantly higher in salts than FKC supplies from Millerton Reservoir.
Should the project include any potential for a reduced water quality to SWID then the
environmental documents are insufficient and need additional work by the Bureau to
analyze potential impacts to SWID. In addition, as the FKC operating entity, Friant Water Authority, and the contracting Districts are all agencies formed and operating under State of California law-they should also be analyzing potential impacts under the California
Environmental Quality Act. Upon review, some of the elements that must be included in
an environmental impact report are not required by an environmental impact statement. And, NEPA is merely procedural', whereas CEQA, in addition to its procedural requirements, contains substantive provisions with which agencies must comply. The most important of these is Pub. Resources Code § 21002, requiring public agencies to deny approval of a project with significant adverse effects when feasible alternatives or
feasible mitigation measures can substantially lessen those effects.2 Finally, CEQA thus
places a higher priority on environmental values than NEPA.3

In part, SWID's areas of interest stem from its on-going activities with the FKC water
quality regiment, subsidence in the FKC, and a variety of State of California regulatory
Robertson v. Methow Valley Citizens Council, 490 U.S. 332, 109 S. Ct. 1835, 104 L. Ed. 2d 351, 29 Env't. Rep. Cas. (BNA) 1497, 19 Envtl. L. Rep. 20743 (1989)

programs. The Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board (CVRWQCB)
mandates the Irrigated Lands Regulatory Program (ILRP) and a CVSALTS Program.
Under the ILRP regulations, the CVRWQCB is limiting the use of groundwater with high
nitrate levels. In addition, the CVSALTS Program is envisioned to limit the salt (TDS
and/or EC) loading on agricultural irrigated land. Along with a variety of projects that
discharge water into the FKC that have cumulative impacts to SWID and other users:

S-year FKC Groundwater Pump-In Program
San Joaquin River Restoration Program Recapture and
Recirculation EIR
Kaweah River Pump-in Program
Tule River Pump-in Program
Storage and Conveyance of Non-Project, Water for Kern
Tulare Water District and Lindsay-
Strathmore Irrigation District

Program
Cawelo Water District Warren Act
Rosedale Rio-Bravo and Delano Barlimart Irrigation District
Banking Program
Kern Tulare Water District Return of Banked Water
North Kern Water Storage District Recovery and
Transportation of Banked Water

We believe it possible to have some focused discussion to prevent degradation of water
quality in the FKC.

Should the above project specifically preclude the pumping of water over the Shafter
Check then the prior comments by SWID can be disregarded. However, if the project contemplates or will engage in pumping water over the Shafter Check, then the project
document is impermissibly narrow in its project goals, it has flawed assumptions, and
thus its reliance on outdated and inapplicable methodologies, and a cursory a treatment of a
reasonable alternatives renders its fatally defective as an information document under the
relevant statutes. SWID acknowledges the significant efforts made by the Bureau and its

staff and we stand ready to offer our support on working through the issues raised or on
other issues raised during the comment period by others. If you should have any
questions about these comments, please call the undersigned.
