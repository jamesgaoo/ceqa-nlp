11  aesthetic, environmental and property interests are directly and adversely affected by the City's
12 approval of the Project, adoption of two Notices of Exemption relating to the CEQA Exemptions

14 and Project, and approval of a zoning ordinance that conflicts with the California Planning Laws.
BACKGROUND FACTS

15 16. In 2004, the Turlock City Council approved Resolution No. 2004-045 establishing
16 Planned Development District No. 233 ("PD-233"), rezoning approximately 6.8 acres--which
17 ineludes the Project Site to be developed in accordance with the standards of the Commercial
18

19 Thoroughfare (C-T) zoning district as described in the Turlock Municipal Code and the Northwest
Triangle Specific Plan.

20 17.

21 In 2012, the City approved the City of Turlock General Plan (the "General Plan"),
which sets the zoning for the Project Site as Highway Commercial.
22 18.

23 The City of Turlock General Plan, in describing the Highway Commercial land use
classification, states:

24

25 This designation provides for uses designed to serve motorists traveling along State Route 99 at or near interchanges that are convenient and safe for

26 such uses, and to a lesser extent along Golden State Boulevard. This designation is also intended to provide locations for uses that depend on high

27 visibility from the freeway. Allowable uses in this designation include

28 service stations, hotels/motels, restaurants, auto sales and other similar types of automobile-dependent uses. This designation corresponds to the

Damrell Nelson Schrimp
Pallios & Sitra 4

..A-Professional
Corportion VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF

Commercial Thoroughfare zoning district. The maximum allowable FAR is
2 0.35.

3 19 Turlock Municipal Code Section 9-3-301 provides that the purpose of the Commercial
4 Thoroughfare District (C-T) zoning classification is "[t]o provide areas for uses required by the
5 traveling public such as hotels and motels, service stations and restaurants, with immediate access
6 to Highway 99.

7 20. In 2016, California voters approved Proposition 64 entitled the "Adult Use of

8 Marijuana Act" ("AUMA"), leading to recreational cannabis sales in California by January 2018.
9 21. While the AUMA legalized the cultivation, processing, and sale of cannabis under
10 Califoria law, possession or sale of cannabis containing more than 0.3% Tetrahydrocannabino!
11 (THC) remains illegal under the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970.1
12 22. On or around June 11, 2019, the Turlock City Council adopted Ordinance 1255-CS
13 enacting cannabis regulations within the jurisdiction of the City and establishing a Cannabis
14 Business Pilot Program. The Cannabis Business Pilot Program allows for the regulation of
15 cannabis businesses by the City through a development agreement and conditional use permit.
16 23. Ordinance 1255-CS and the Cannabis Business Pilot Program were adopted by the City
17 without any CEQA review or compliance.
18 24. On or around August 13, 2019, the Turlock City Council adopted Ordinance No. 1259-
19 CS, which amended Title 9 of the Turlock Municipal Code to establish zoning regulations for
20 commercial cannabis businesses within the City's jurisdiction. At the outset, the City barred retail
21 cannabis dispensaries within Commercial Thoroughfare (C-T) zoning districts.
22 25. Ordinance No. 1259-CS was adopted by the City without any CEQA review or
23 compliance.
24 26. On or around February 11, 2020, the Turlock City Council adopted Ordinance No.
25 1275-CS which, among other things, amended Turlock Municipal Code Section 9-3-302 to expand
26 and authorize the retail sale of cannabis within Commercial Thoroughfare (C-T) zoning districts.
27

28' Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the primary psychoactive agent in cannabis.

Damreli Nelson Schrimp 5
Pallios d Siha VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF A Professional
Corporation

27. Ordinance No. 1275-CS was adopted by the City without any CEQA review or

2 compliance.

3 28. Petitioners are informed and believe that, in or around July 2020, Mr. Russom, on

4 behalf of and at the direction of NHC or its agents and/or affiliates, submitted an application (the

5 "Application") to the City to drastically remodel and expand an existing family sit-down restaurant

6 (E] Rosal) at the Project Site to operate a retail cannabis dispensary thereon--the Project.

7 29. Petitioners are informed and believe that, in processing the Application, the City

8 improperly bifurcated and separately analyzed the individual components of the Project as opposed

9 to reviewing the Project, and the actual and potential environmental impacts therefrom, as a whole.
10 30. The Project was first set for consideration by the City during the regular meeting of the

11 City of Turlock Planning Commission on August 6, 2020. The Staff Report for said Planning

12 Commission Meeting recommended that the Planning Commission find that the CUP was

13 categorically exempt from CEQA under the "existing facilities exemption" and approve the CUP.

14 The Staff Report further recommended that the Planning Commission find that the Development

15 Agreement was categorically exempt from CEQA under the "common sense exemption" and

16 approve the Development Agreement.

17 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

18 31. Petitioner Jacob, on behalf of himself and Petitioner Badalian, appeared before the City

19 of Turlock Planning Commission on August 6, 2020, and opposed the Project and the proposed
20 CEQA determinations relating to the Project. Despite Petitioners' objections, the City of Turlock

21 Planning Commission voted to approve the Project and the determination that the Project was

22 categorically exempt from CEQA.

23 32. Petitioner Jacob, on behalf of himself and Petitioner Badalian, appealed the Planning
24 Commission's approval of the Project and CEQA determination to the Turlock City Council and.

25 pursuant to Turlock Municipal Code Section 1-4-04, exercised their right to a 30-day period to

26 prepare the appeal to the Turlock City Council (the "Appeal*). The Appcal was accepted by the

27 City,

•l 33. On August 25, 2020, during the regular meeting of the Turlock City Council and during

2 the pendency of Petitioners' Appeal, the Turlock City Council improperly took action to advance

3 the Project and voted to approve the first reading of the Development Agreement.

4 34. On September 8, 2020, Petitioner Jacob, on behalf of himself and Petitioner Badalian,
5 as well as their counsel, Blaine R. Cox, appeared before the Turlock City Council and opposed the

6 City's proposed and recommended action to adopt an ordinance approving the Development
7 Agreement prior to the hearing on the Appeal. Petitioners also objected to the City's actions as an

8 improper "piecemealing" or segmenting of the Project into smaller components to understate the

9 Projects impacts. The City agreed to continue the consideration of the Development Agreement to

10 the Turlock City Council's regular meeting on September 22, 2020, for consideration of the

11 Appeal as a whole.

12 35. Petitioner Jacob, on behalf of himself and Petitioner Badalian, as well as their counsel,

13 Blaine R. Cox, appeared before the Turlock City Council on September 22, 2020 and opposed the

14 Project anc the proposed.CEQA determinations relating to the Project. Despite Petitioners* Appeal
15 and opposition to the Project and the claimed CEQA Exemptions related to the Project, the

16 Turlock City Council voted to approve the Project and the CEQA Exemptions.

17 36. Petitioners have no plain, speed y, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law

18 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require the City to set aside their

19 approvals of the Project and finding that the Project is categorically exempt undor CEQA.

20 37. Petitioners have brought this action within 35 days of the City filing two Notices of

21 Exemption relating to the Project as required by Public Resources Code section 21167(d).

22 38. Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by concurrently
23 filing a request concerning the preparation of the record of administrative proceedings relating to

24 the Project. Petitioners have further complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and

25 Code of Civil Procedure § 388 by furnishing a copy of this Petition to the Attorney General of the
26 State of California within 10 days after filing this Petition.

1 ATTORNEYS' FEES

2 39, Petitioner brings this action under Code of Civil Procedure & 1021.5, and other
3 applicable laws, which entitle Petitioner to an award of attorney's fees in actions to enforce an

4 important right affecting the public interest, such as the CEQA and Planning and Zoning Law

5 violations hore in question.

6 40. In addition to § 1021.5, or in the alternative, Petitioner brings this action on the basis of
7 Government Code 800, which would entitle Petitioners to an award of attorney's fees.

8 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

9 (Prejudicial Abuse of Discretion: Failure to Comply with CEQA)

10 41. Petitioners re-allege and by this reference incorporate paragraphs 1 through 40
11 inclusive, as if fully set forth herein.

12 42. CEQA defines a "Project" as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for
13 resulting in either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect
14 physical change in the in environment' which is undertaken by governmental agency. The whole of

15 the action to be considered by the City cntails consideration of the potential effects of both the
16 Conditional Use Permit (including the activities thercunder') and the Development Agreement
17 together, and not separated out into individual components without consideration of the collective
18 effects of both taken together.

19 43. The City committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in the

20 manner required by law in filing the Notices of Exemption and failing to prepare an initial study
21 and/or environmental impact report to identify, analyze, disclose, and mitigate significant

22 environmental impacts from the Project prior to approving the Project.

23 44. The City exercised porsonal discretionary judgment in deciding to approve the Project
24 despite the Project's potential to cause significant environmental effects that had not been
25 disclosed, evaluated, or mitigated. Such discretionary decision-making triggered the City's

26 obligation to consider the Project's environmental effects as required by CEQA prior to approving
27 the Project.

28

Damrell Nelson Schrimp 8
Pallios & Silva
A-Professional VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEE

Corporntion

1 45. The City's decision to approve the Project commits the City to a definitive course of
2 action that will, or in the alternative may, result in significant physical environmental changes, both
3 direct and indirect.

4 46. The common-sense exemption to CEQA review (14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15061(b)(3))
applies only where it can be seen with certainty that a project will not have a significant effect on
6 the environment, and the City failed to meet its evidentiary burden to invoke that exception.
7 47. The existing facilities exemption to CEQA review (14 Cal. Code Regs., § 15301)
8 applies only to "minor alteration of existing public or private structures, facilities, ... or
9 topographical features, involving negligible or no expansion of existing or former use." Here, the
10 Project would not only expand the existing use at the Project Site, it would entirely change the
11 existing use thereon from a sit-down family restaurant to a commercial cannabis dispensary with,
12 among other things, drastically higher levels of patronage, security, traffic generation, and new
13 environmental concerns that did not exist under the prior use.
14 48 CEQA categorical exemptions are unavailable where "there is a reasonable probability
15 that the activity will bave a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances."

16 Unusual circumstances exist with respect to the Project as the products proposed to be sold
17 pursuant to the Projcct-cannabis-remains to be a Schedule I drug under the Controlled
18 Substances Act and the activities thereunder remain illegal. The illicit nature of retail cannabis
[9 sales inevitably creates unusual circumstances related to crime and security, while the physical
20 nature of Cannabis products create unusual circumstances related to, among other things, odor,
21 waste, e-waste (generated by electronic devices used to consume cannabis), impaired driving, and
22 underage consumption.

23 49. The City did not evaluate the Project's potential to cause or contribute to these
24 significant environmental impacts.

25 50. Accordingly, the City prejudicially abused its discretion in adopting the Notices of
26 Exemption and failing to evaluate and mitigate individual and cumulative environmental impacts
27 from the Project.

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 (Violation of General Plan Laws - Government Code §§ 65300 et seq.; CCP § 1085) §
3 51. Petitioners re-allege and by this reference incorporate paragraphs 1 through 50
4 inclusive, as if fully set forth herein.

5 52. The Planning and Zoning Laws, Cal. Government Code §§ 65000 et seq. ("Planning
6 and Zoning Laws") govern the land-use planning process for the city, county and local
7 government agencies within the State of California.

8 53. The Planning and Zoning Laws mandate that cities and counties prepare a general
9 plan to govern the long term, physical development of the land under city and county jurisdiction
10 addressing the following cight mandatory elements: land use, circulation, housing, conservation,
11 open space, noise, safety, and environmental justice. (Cal. Government Code §§ 65300, 65302.)
12 54. Each California city and county must adopt a comprehensive, long-term general plan
13 governing development. (Napu Citizens for Hanest Gov. v. Napa County Bd. of Supervisors
14 (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 342, 352, citing Gov. Code §§ 65030, 65300.) The general plan sits at the
15 top of the land use planning hierarchy (sec DeVita v. County of Napa (1995) 9 Cal.4th 763, 773),
16 and serves as a "constitution" or "charter" for all future development. (Lesher Communications,
17 Inc. v. City of Walnut Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 540.)
18 55. Government Code section 65300.5 requires the City to ensure that "the general plan
19 and clements and parts thereof comprise an integrated, internally consistent and compatible
20 statement of policies for the adopting agency."
21 56. Government Code section 65860 requires that all zoning ordinances of the City be
22 consistent with the general plan and the land uses authorized by the ordinance be compatible with
23 the objectives, policies, general land uses, and programs specified in the general plan.
24 57. A zoning ordinance thai is inconsistent with the general plan is invalid when passed
25 (Lesher Communications, Inc. v. City of Walnut Creek (1990) 52 Cal.3d 531, 541.)
26 58. In adopting Ordinance No. 1275-CS and purporting to allow retail commercial
27  cannabis dispensaries within Commercial Thoroughfare (C-T) zoning districts, the City created a
28 zoning ordinance that is inconsistent with its General Plan.

Damweil Nelson Schrimp 10
Pallios & Siha VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF Professianal
Corporation

:

59. In addition to Ordinance No. 1275-CS and the Project's inconsistency with the General
2 Plan, the Project is also inconsistent with the applicable Northwest Triangle Specific Pian, and PD
3 233.

•4 60. The City's adoption of Ordinance No. 1275-CS was legislative act reviewable under
5 section 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure. At all times herein, the City has had the ability to
6 comply with the Government Code.

7 61. Because Ordinance No. 1275-CS and the Project are each inconsistent with the
8 General Plan, the City's approvals of Ordinance No. 1275-CS and the Project violated the
9 Planning and Zouing Laws and must be set aside.

10 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
I1 (Violation of Procedural Due Process)
12 62. Petitioners re-allege and by this reference incorporate paragraphs I through 61
13 inclusive, as if fully set forth herein.
14 63. The constitutional guarantee of due process under the Fourteenth Amendment
15 requires the City and its Councilmembers to conduct adjudicative proceedings in a fair, impartial
16 and unbiased manner.

17 64. The constitutional guarantee of due process requires that adjudicatory decisions be
18 based on factual findings rather than speculation and bias.
19 65. The City denied Petitioners their procedural due process rights.
20 66. The City's conduct set forth above was acted upon under color of state law.
21 67. The City has a clear and present duty to comply with the Fourteenth Amendment of
22 the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 7, of the California Constitution, and
23 Petitioners' have a clear, present and beneficial interest in the performance of such duty.
24 68. As an actual and proximate result of Defendants' actions, Petitioners have suffered
25 one or more violations of their constitutional rights.
