Petition for Writ of Mandamus

1 Petitioner alleges:

2 Introduction

3 1. The Friends of New Helvetia Public Housing bring this mandamus action in the

4 public interest to enforce California's environmental laws. The Friends claim that the City of

5 Sacramento's approval of the West Broadway Specific Plan violated the protective mandates
of the California Environmental Quality Act. CEQA safeguards California's unique 'built'
6 Il environment including a National Register Historic Landmark District known as New
7 Helvetia that lies within the Specific Plan's boundaries - just as it protects natural
8 environmental resources such as clean air and water and endangered flora and fauna.

q The New Helvetia public housing project of 360 units was a first in Sacramento and

10 became an early national model of racially-integrated public housing. It is the legacy of

11 Nathaniel Sextus Colley, the first Black attorney in private practice in the city. Colley became a

12 national civil rights leader in the mid-twentieth century via successful court battles against
housing segregation, beginning at New Helvetia. In his words: "Housing segregation is the
13 key to the entire fight for desegregation in America. Until we desegregate housing, all of our

14 other efforts will be of limited consequence."

15 Despite the ongoing and historic importance of New Helvetia, the as-adopted West

16 Broadway Specific Plan anticipates and facilitates needless demolition. The city discounted the

17 protests of racial justice advocates including the Nathaniel S. Colley, Sr., Civil Rights Coalition,

18 tenants, preservation organizations, and concerned Sacramento residents objecting to the
portion of the Specific Plan that encompasses New Helvetia. The city failed to analyze or adopt
19 viable Plan alternatives to rehabilitate much of New Helvetia's housing while allowing
20 additional mixed-use development.

21 As the Plan recites, its practical purpose is to facilitate new development in the West

22 Broadway area to provide substantial new housing as well as mixed-use retail and other

23 development. The approved Plan depends on a new street grid -- prominently displayed

24 throughout the Plan - that directly conflicts with the historic buildings and roadway that
have defined New Helvetia for many decades.
25 As a public service, a prominent architectural firm, Cody Anderson Wasney Architects,

26 Inc., prepared a New Helvetia Historic District Development Study addressing rehabilitation

27 of a majority of the historic public housing on twenty-six acres while accomplishing

28 substantial new development envisioned to meet the Specific Plan's objectives, including a

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 2

1 complimentary street grid. In refusing to consider the potentially-feasible Plan alternative in

2 the environmental impact report (EIR) process, the city violated CEQA.

3 The city's approval also violated CEQA in approving the Plan that is designed to
accommodate the demolition of the historic New Helvetia public housing. The Plan would
4 require amendment to avoid demolition, dependent on future circumstances including
5 whether the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development [HUD] insists. CEQA does

6 not allow a lead agency to rely on project mitigations or alternatives that may or may not be

7 imposed by another agency.

8 This action seeks to enforce CEQA to require the city to revised its EIR to study, and

9 then to approve a feasible Plan alternative that reduces or avoids the significant impacts of
demolishing a national landmark. The city assured the concerned public and New Helvetia
10 tenants that rehabilitation of New Helvetia remains of interest and may be considered in the
11 future if feasible. That is insufficient to comply with CEQA. Instead of incorporating a street

12 grid and design consistent with anticipated demolition, the current Plan should incorporate a

13 street grid and design that anticipates and facilitates the rehabilitation of New Helvetia. It

14 could also include provisions allowing amendment to allow future demolition if necessary.

15 As pointed out to the City Council, the sequence of planning for New Helvetia must be
reversed to comply with CEQA. The Plan should anticipate rehabilitation, with an appropriate
16 street grid, while allowing for a future Plan amendment for demolition if proven necessary.
17 The Friends respectfully seek this Court's peremptory writ in the public interest to

18 require the city to set aside its approvals of the West Broadway Specific Plan and its

19 certification of the EIR, and to reconsider the Plan only after revising the EIR and making

20 findings that comply with CEQA.

1 Jurisdiction

2 2.

3 This Court has jurisdiction under Public Resources Code section 21168.5 and
Code of Civil Procedure section 1085. The parties are located in the City and County of

4 Sacramento, and the New Helvetia Historic District is located there.

5 Parties

6 3.

7 Petitioner Friends of New Helvetia Public Housing is an unincorporated

8 association formed in September 2020. Its public interest purposes include the enhancement,
protection, and preservation of the New Helvetia Historic District, located on Broadway and
9 Muir Way in Sacramento, and advocating for establishment of an active civil rights center in

10 the historic district to honor Nathaniel Colley, who fought Sacramento's first segregation

11 lawsuit at New Helvetia. Its members enjoy and appreciate the New Helvetia Historic District

12 and seek to enforce the California Environmental Quality Act to protect its historic context and

13 use. The Friends bring this petition on behalf of all others similarly situated and too numerous

14 to be named and brought before this Court as petitioners. Among its members, Dan Visnich

15 and Karen Jacques objected to the respondents' approval of the West Broadway Specific Plan
and exhausted administrative remedies for the since-formed Friends group.

16 4. Respondents City of Sacramento and its City Council and Community

17 Development Department (collectively, the city) is the lead agency that approved the Specific

18 Plan and is responsible for CEQA compliance.
5.

19 Does 1 to 10 are fictitiously-named real parties in interest whose true names and

20 capacities are currently unknown to the Friends. If and when true names and capacities are
known, petitioner will amend this petition to assert them.

21 6. A copy of this petition has been mailed to the California Attorney General.

18 9. The northeast side of the Specific Plan contains Alder Grove. Twenty-six of its 32
19 acres is known as New Helvetia, a post-World War II public housing project of 360 units that
20 a was a first in Sacramento. It became an early national model of racially-integrated public

21 housing. Now a National Register Landmark, it is the legacy of Nathaniel Sextus Colley, the

22 first Black attorney to practice in the city. Colley became a national civil rights leader via

23 successful court battles against segregation in public housing, beginning at New Helvetia.
The historic housing project remains in use.
24

25 Administrative and Environmental Review Process

26 10. In April 2018, the city began preparation of the West Broadway Specific Plan,

27 planned to provide a comprehensive guide for the integration of infill development and

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 5

1 redevelopment in the Plan area. An EIR was prepared. The Draft Plan was reviewed in public

2 meetings held by the city's Planning and Design Commission in July and August 2019.
11.
3 In July 2020, the Planning and Design Commission held a zoom hearing and
forwarded to the City Council its recommendation to adopt the Plan. The City Council held a
4 zoom hearing on August 25, 2020, and over the public objections the majority certified the EIR
5 and adopted CEQA findings; approved the Plan; and approved various related approvals

6 implementing the Plan including, inter alia, resolutions and ordinances effecting rezoning of

7 parcels within the Plan are and amending the General Plan and Central City Specific Plan.

8 12. The adopted Plan anticipates the demolition of New Helvetia, and would require

9 amendment to rehabilitate it. The Plan amends the current street grid in the Plan area,
inconsistent with the placement of the New Helvetia Historic District roadways and buildings.

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 6

1 13. On August 26, 2020, the city filed and posted a Notice of Determination with the

2 County and the State Clearinghouse. This action is timely filed within 30 days.
14.
3 The Friends have no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course
of law. Issuance of a peremptory writ is needed to avoid immediate, severe, and irreparable
4 harm to Sacramento residents and the city's environment via implementation of the West
5 Broadway Specific Plan. The city has the capacity to correct its violations of law but has failed

6 and refused to do so.

7

8 Violations of the California Environmental Quality Act
15.
9 The Friends incorporate all previous paragraphs as if fully set forth.
16. CEQA requires agencies to conduct a prescribed EIR process before taking
10 a actions that may have a significant adverse environmental impact. The point of the process is
11 to inform the public and to provide necessary information to allow elected officials and

12 decisionmakers to comply with CEQA's substantive mandate: to adopt feasible project

13 mitigations and alternatives that can reduce a project's significant environmental impacts.

14 17. While the city has not yet made available to the public, despite requests, the final

15 versions of its resolutions and ordinances relating to the August 2020 approvals of the Specific
Plan, based on the information available and subject to supplementation: the city abused its
16 discretion and failed to act in the manner required by law in approving the Plan with
17 significant impacts, inter alia and as supplemented by the record of proceedings, including:

18 a. Certification of the EIR with inadequate project objectives; insufficient analysis of

19 significant project impacts; insufficient identification and analysis of potentially feasible

20 mitigations; and insufficient identification and analysis of a reasonable range of alternatives as

21 a matter of law to adequately provide information to the decisionmakers and the public;
b. Failure to adequately respond to comments on the Draft EIR;
22 C. Failure to adopt findings supported by substantial evidence in the whole of the
23 record and contrary to facts and analysis in that record, including but not limited to findings

24 as to significance of project environmental impacts, feasibility of mitigations and alternatives,

25 whether significant project environmental effects have been eliminated or substantially

26 lessened in light of expert analysis and information to the contrary, and a statement of

27 overriding considerations.

28

Petition for Writ of Mandamus 7

1 WHEREFORE, the petitioner prays:

2 1. That the Court issue a judgment and a peremptory writ ordering the city

3 respondents to set aside all actions and approvals relating to the West Broadway Specific Plan

4 and its implementing approvals, resolutions, and ordinances as described in the Notice of

5 Determination, requiring that before further consideration of Plan approval the city revise and

6 recirculate the project EIR and identify and adopt feasible mitigations and alternatives and
make all findings required by CEQA, supported by substantial evidence;
7 2. That the Court enjoin the city and its employees and agents from all physical
8 actions furthering the Plan or issuing permits for others to do so while the petition is pending

9 and after judgment pending compliance with the writ;

10 3. For petitioner's reasonable costs, expenses, and attorney fees pursuant to Code

11 of Civil Procedure section 1021.5; and
4.
12 For other and further relief as the Court finds proper.
