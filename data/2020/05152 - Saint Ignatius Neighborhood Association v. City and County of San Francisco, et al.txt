I. INTRODUCTION

1. Petitioner Saint Ignatius Neighborhood Association ("Petitioner") challenges Respondent
2 City and County of San Francisco's ("City") November 10. 2020 approval of stadium lighting and
3 a telecommunications tower at the Saint Ignatius athletic field at 2001-37th Avenue ("Project") as
V a conditional use under the City's planning code, exempt from environmental review under the
5 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), Public Resources Code §§ 21000 et seq.
6
2. The Project proposes to add four 90-foot tall light towers to the J.B. Murphy Field
7 Stadium (field) at St. Ignatius College Preparatory (SI), a private secondary school located in a
8 residential neighborhood in the Sunset District of San Francisco. The light towers are intended to
9 allow for up to 150 nights a year of weekday and weekend evening use of the field for practice,
10
games and events lasting until 8:30 pm and on 15 evenings per year until 10:00 pm. In addition,
11 on the proposed northwest light tower, the Project seeks to install and operate a Verizon Wireless
12 telecommunication service facility, consisting of nine antennas, six remote radio units and
13 ancillary equipment.
14 3. The light and wireless towers would be the tallest structures in the area of the affected
15 Sunset District neighborhood, exceeding the 40 foot height limit for this area by more than a
16 factor of two. The Project will expand previous games, practices and events into the evening and
17 nighttime hours until as late as 10 p.m. through the installation of permanent lighting at the
18 Project site. This change in use will have new and potentially significant impacts on residents
19 surrounding the stadium due to evening light pollution and glare, as well as noise, traffic and
20 parking impacts caused by the change in the timing of events into the evening and nighttime hours
21 and the aesthetic impacts of four 90 foot towers suddenly appearing in the neighborhood.
22
4. Despite the potentially significant impacts of this major change in the field facility,
23 including a shift to nighttime sports activities, the Planning Department chose to exempt this
24 Project from CEQA review, relying on the Class 1 Existing Facility, and Class 3, New
25 Construction exemptions contained in the CEQA Guidelines, 14 Cal. Code Regs. 15000 et. al.
26 However, the Project adding a l: ghting facility allowing for expanded use into the evening hours
27 does not fit within these or any other CEQA exemptions. See CEQA Guidelines §§ 15301, 15302.
28 Further, even if the Project did fall within a CEQA exemption, it has the potential for significant

1
Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

impacts to the surrounding neighborhood and thus must undergo a CEQA review process. See
CEQA Guidelines § 15300.2.
2
5. Petitioner also challenges the City's approval of the Project as contrary to the City's
3 Planning Code ("City Code") and its General Plan. The Project does not serve the neighborhood
4 and will be detrimental to the health, safety, convenience or general welfare of persons residing or
5 working in the vicinity. See City Code § 303(c). The Project is also inconsistent with the General
6 Plan's requirement that parking and traffic issues be thoroughly evaluated prior to project
7 approval. See City General Plan, Commerce and Industry Element - Policy 6.9.
8
6. Petitioner seeks a writ of mandate directing the City to set aside its Project approval until
it has complied with CEQA and its zoning code and General Plan. See Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5
10 II. PARTIES
11 7. Petitioner Saint Ignatius Neighborhood Association (SINA) is a mutual association comprised
12 of over 160 members who live in the area surrounding Saint Ignatius College Preparatory, located at
13 2001 37th Avenue in the Sunset District. Petitioner was formed in response to SI's proposal for a
14 lighted stadium for games and events at the high school. Petitioner and its members provided oral
15 and written comments to the City on the Project. Petitioner's members are volunteers promoting
16 well-planned growth and development in a manner that protects the local environment and
17 neighborhood community and the health and safety of its citizens.
18
8. Respondent City and County of San Francisco (City) is and was at all relevant times the
19 governmental entity responsible for reviewing and approving the Project challenged in this action.
20 9. Real Party in Interest the Ignatian Corporation aka Saint Ignatius College Preparatory (SI) is
21 a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation operating a private secondary school located in a residential
22 neighborhood in the Sunset District of San Francisco, with a listed location and mailing address of
23 2001 37th Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94116.
24
10. Real Party in Interest Verizon Wireless Services LLC is a Delaware limited liability company
25 with a headquarters and mailing address of One Verizon Way, Basking Ridge, New Jersey 07920.
26 11. The true names and capacities of Respondent Does 1-10 are not presently known to Petitioner.

III. JURISDICTION AND EXHAUSTION OF REMEDIES

12. Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure 1094.5 & Public
2 Resources Code $ 21168.
3 13. Petitioner SINA was formed by concerned local citizens prior to the City's approval of the
4 Project. Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to filing this instant action and has
5 exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required by law. Petitioner and
6 its members provided written and oral comments to the City during the administrative phase of this
7 Project related to each of the claims raised in this Petition.
8 14. On December 14, 2020, Petitioner's attorney faxed a Notice of Commencement of Action
9 letter pursuant to Public Resources Code § 21167.5 informing the City of its intent to file a legal
10 action challenging the City's approval of the Project. (See Exhibit 1, attached hereto.)
11
15. On December 15, 2020 Petitioner's attorney mailed a copy of its Verified Petition to the
12 Attorney General's office to give notice of Petitioner's intent to bring this proceeding as a private
13 attorney general under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. (See Exhibit 2, attached hereto.)
14 16. Petitioner has no other adequate remedy in the course of law unless this Court grants the
15 requested writ of mandate. In the absence of such remedy, the City's Project approval will remain
16 in effect in violation of law.
17 IV. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
18
A. SETTING AND PROJECT DESCRIPTION
19 17. SI has been in San Francisco and is located at 2001 37th Avenue in the Sunset District of San
20 Francisco. The SI campus occupies a 495,470 square foot parcel and is developed with approximately
21 290,595 square feet of secondary school facilities. J.B. Murphy Field athletic stadium is located at
22 the southwest corner of the campus, with frontage on 39th Avenue and Rivera Street. The stadium
23 consists of a football field with artificial turf and a six lane synthetic track that surrounds the football
24 field perimeter. The project site is surrounded by a steel fence with four locked access gates located
25 on-site: three locked gates on 39th avenue and one locked gate on Rivera Street. During 2019-2020,
26 SI rented temporary lighting that was used for up to 40 evenings until approximately 7:30 p.m. The
27 temporary lighting was unpermitted, not approved by the City and received no CEQA review.
28 18. Around the stadium are predominantly two-story, mostly single family residential homes,

3
Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

including directly west of the sports field across 39th Avenue and to the south across Rivera Street.
The AP Giannini Middle School, Ortega Branch Library, West Sunset Community Garden, and the

2 Sunset Elementary School are located to the north, and the San Francisco Park and Recreation fields
to the west. The Sunset Parkway, consisting of 36th Avenue, Sunset Boulevard, 37th Avenue and
landscaped medians are located to the east of the project.
5 19. The Project includes the expansion of SI's facilities by adding four (4) permanent 90-foot tall

6 light standards to the J.B. Murphy Field Stadium. The lighting will allow for nighttime use of the
7 field for practice and games by SI's athletic teams. The addition of the lights will allow for evening

8 use of the field for practice, games and events until as late as from 8:30 to 10 pm. In addition, the

9 Project includes an unmanned macro wireless telecommunications service (WTS) facility attached
10 to the northwest light standard. The WTS consists of nine antennas, six remote radio units located on
11 the light standard, two surge suppressors, and ancillary equipment within a 12-foot by 28-foot fenced
12 compound located on the ground adjacent to the north side of the light standard.
13 20. As finally approved by the City, the Project will allow field lights Monday-Thursday until
14 8:30pm. Lights may be used for 150 nights per year. Sound systems and/or amplified sound shall
15 not be used past 7:30pm except for later games and events. In addition, for up to 15 evenings per year
16 out of the 150 allowable nights, the lights may remain on until 10:00 pm on any day of the week
17 except Sunday. Sound systems and/or amplified sound shall not be used past 9:30pm.
18 B. DISTRICT'S APPROVAL OF THE PROJECT.

19 21. The City approved the Project by granting a Conditional Use Authorization ("CUA"), pursuant
20 to Planning Code Sections 209.1, 303, and 304 to amend an existing Planned Unit Development
21 ("PUD") "to allow the expansion of a private secondary school by constructing four light standards
22 and a macro WTS facility with rear yard modification within an RH-1 Zoning District."
23 22. On June 3, 2020, the Planning Department determined that the Project was categorically
24 exempt from further environmental review under CEQA. The Planning Departments staff reviewed
25 the proposed project and determined that additional transportation review was not required as the
26 addition of lights at the existing facility would not expand the use of such facility but would instead,
27 shift the existing use to later times in the day. Planning Department staff also found that "light
28 spillover would not be expected to substantially affect the closest residences" and that "the light and

4
Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

glare from the proposed lighting system would be nominal on surrounding residential areas."
Planning Department staff found that the "Project is desirable because it promotes the operation of

2 a neighborhood-serving school." Overall, the Planning Department found the Project "to be
3 necessary, desirable, and compatible with the surrounding neighborhood, and not to be detrimental
4 to persons or adjacent properties in the vicinity."
5 23. On July 23, 2020, the Planning Commission approved a CUA for the Project and affirmed the

6 Planning Department's determination of a CEQA exemption.
7 24. On August 21, 2020 and August 24, 2020 respectively, Petitioner filed a timely appeal of the

8 Planning Commission's approval of the CUA and CEQA exemption for the Project.

9 25. On October 6, 2020, the Board of Supervisors ("Board") held a duly noticed public hearing
10 to consider the appeal, at which it heard extensive testimony and upheld the Planning Commission
11 and Planning Department's exemption of the Project from CEQA review.
12 26. On October 20,2020, the Board voted to conditionally disapprove the Planning Commission's
13 approval of the CUA for the Project, and then to approve the CUA for the same property,

14 incorporating the Planning Commission conditions along with additional conditions and guidelines
15 for the Project developed after the October 6, 2020 Board hearing. The additional conditions require
16 1) SI to work with the Planning Department on the building design, including, "to the extent
17 possible" have settings to dim the lights to the minimum necessary to ensure safety of the field; • 2)
18 SI to submit "an exterior lighting plan to the Planning Department and all registered neighborhood
19 groups for the area which will "include, to the extent possible, how lights will be set at the minimum
20 necessary to ensure safety of the field;" 3) reduction of nightly field and light usage by ½ hour to
21 8:30 p.m., and the number of events with lights on until 10 pm to 15 per year; • 4) SI to install a light
22 monitoring system that, "to the extent possible, reports each date and time the lights are turned on,
23 the foot candle setting(s) used, the times the lights are dimmed and the time the lights are turned off,"
24 which information shall be made available on the Good Neighbor Program web page and updated at
25 least monthly; • 5) amplified sound to be limited to spectator attended events on Monday to Saturday;
26 6) limits on Sunday use of the field to 12pm - 5pm; • 7) SI to update its Large Event Management
27 Plan to include as part of their day-of-event transportation plans additional proposals for St. Ignatius
28 to provide "off-site parking;" 8) SI to provide off-site parking to accommodate at least 200 vehicles

5
Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

for events with anticipated crowds of more than 500 people; • 9) SI to post on its Good Neighbor
Program web page the anticipated schedule of all practices, events, games, or activities on the field
2 at least a month in advance; 10) trees to be planted every 20ft along the 39th Ave and Rivera public
3 sidewalks; and • 11) establishment of a community liaison officer who shall enforce the Large Event
4 Management Plan and conditions.
5 27. On November 10, 2020, the Board approved the Project. As part of its approval, the Board
6 found that the "Project, as originally approved by the Planning Commission, would be unduly
7 detrimental to people residing and working in the vicinity, their families, and especially their growing
8 children by increasing noise and light during certain hours, and limiting public access to street parking

9 during those hours, but that "[r]egulating the times of use of field lights can protect youth from the
10 negative impacts of evening activities on their development, and provide neighbors consistency and
11 reliability in the quality of their home life" and that "[p]rohibiting field lights and amplified sound
12 on Sundays can provide relief and consistency to neighbors, while protecting their health,
13 convenience, and general welfare. The Board ultimately found that with the new conditions, the
14 Project would be "desirable for and compatible with the neighborhood and community." As part of
15 its approval, the Board also affirmed the Planning Department's determination of exemption from
16 review under CEQA.
17 C. PETITIONER'S EXHAUSTION AND SERVICE ON ATTORNEY GENERAL.

18 28. During the administrative phase, Petitioner and its members, as well as other citizens,
19 submitted written and oral comments to the Planning Department, Commission and Board objecting
20 to the Project and highlighting the deficiencies in the City's review of the Project's environmental
21 impacts on the neighborhood and compliance with the City's planning code and General Plan.
22 29. On December 14, 2020, Petitioner's attorney faxed a Notice of Commencement of Action
23 letter to the City's offices informing the City of Petitioner's intent to file a legal action challenging
24 the City's approval of the Project. (See Exhibit 1, attached hereto.)
25 30. On December 15, 2020, Petitioner's attorney served a copy of this Verified Petition on the
26 Attorney General's office to give notice of Petitioner's intent to bring this proceeding as a private
27 attorney general under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. (See Exhibit 2, attached hereto.)

Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

V. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
1 (Violation of CEQA: Pub. Res. Code § 21168)

2 31. Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations in the paragraphs set forth above.

3 32. The City's approval of the Project violates CEQA by exempting the Project from any CEQA

4 review. The Project is a large construction that will introduce lighted evening sports activities into

5 a low light residential neighborhood for up to 150 nights during the fall and winter evenings until 8:30

6 or 10 p.m. This drastic change will have significant impacts to residents due to light and glare

7 pollution and the aesthetic impacts of the large towers, as well as increased evening noise, traffic and

8 parking, particularly for the 15 events a year lasting until 10 pm as envisioned by the Project. CEQA

9 review is required for light stadium projects such as this one.

10 33. The City violated CEQA by exempting the Project from environmental review based on the

11 Class 1 Existing Facility exemption. See CEQA Guidelines § 15301. This exemption is inapplicable

12 to the Project, a lighted sports facility complex that will add new impacts such as glare and light

13 illumination, while also expanding stadium use into the nighttime hours to as late as 10 p.m. with

14 accompanying noise, traffic, parking and other adverse effects on the local neighborhood.

15 34. The City also exempted the Project from CEQA review based on the Class 3, New

16 Construction exemption. See CEQA Guidelines § 15303. This exemption is inapplicable to the

17 Project, a lighted sports facility complex that will expand use and add new impacts such as glare and

18 light illumination, as well as noise and parking. The 90 foot light towers erected to allow for

19 nighttime sports activities in a residential neighborhood is a different project than the 'small

20 structures' described in the exemption such as a garage, patio or a residence, and safety effects.

21 35. The City's approval of the Project violates CEQA. The Project has the possibility for

22 significant impacts due to its unusual size and new change of use being introduced into the evening

23 hours of the neighborhood, in which case an exception to the CEQA exemptions would apply, thereby

24 requiring CEQA review. See CEQA Guidelines 15300.2(c). Such impacts would include aesthetic

25 visual impacts caused by the tall lighting and cell-phone towers, the shifting of game and event

26 impacts to the local community into the evening hours, traffic, parking, noise and public safety

27 impacts, along with their attendant social effects related to these environmental changes.

Petitioner's Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate Case No.

VI. SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
(Violation of City Code; Inconsistency with City General Plan)
2 36. Petitioner incorporates by reference the allegations in the paragraphs set forth above.
3
37. The City's approval of the Project violates the City Planning Code provisions applicable to
4 conditional use authorizations. See City Code § 303(c).
5
38. The Project is not necessary or desirable for, and compatible with, the neighborhood or the
6 community. The proposed use exceeds the Non-Residential Use Size limitations for the district in
7 which the use is located, the proposed use will not serve the neighborhood, in whole or in significant
part, and the facility proposed does not respect the scale of development in the district. Id. §
9
303(c)(1).
10 39. The Project will be detrimental to the health, safety, convenience or general welfare of persons
11 residing or working in the vicinity with respect to: • (A) the nature of the proposed site, including
12 its size and shape, and the proposed size, shape and arrangement of structures; (B) accessibility
13 and traffic patterns for persons and vehicles, the type and volume of such traffic, and the adequacy
14 of proposed off-street parking and loading and of proposed alternatives to off-street parking; and
15 (C) safeguards afforded to prevent noxious or offensive emissions such as noise, glare, dust and odor.
16 Id. § 303(c)(2).
17 40. The Project does not comply with the applicable provisions of the City Code and will
18 adversely affect the General Plan by being inconsistent with Commerce and Industry Element Policy
19 6.9 as set forth below. Id. § 303(c)(3).
20 41. The Project violates City Code § 303(c)(4) in that it will provide development that is not in
21 conformity with the stated purpose of the applicable RH-1 use district, which is intended to recognize,
22 protect, conserve and enhance areas characterized by dwellings in the form of houses, usually with
23 one, two or three units with separate entrances, and limited scale in terms of building width and
24 height. See City Code § 209.1.
25 42. The Project is inconsistent with the General Plan, Commerce and Industry Element Policy
26 6.9, which requires that traffic impacts and parking problems caused by projects be evaluated and
27 minimized and, if adequate parking does not exist or cannot be provided, or excess parking demand
28 cannot be otherwise mitigated, the use be denied.

VII. PRAYER FOR RELIEF

WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:
2
1. For a Writ of Mandate ordering the City to (a) set aside its decision approving the
3 Project; (b) comply with CEQA with respect to any further action taken with respect to the Project;
4 (c) take whatever additional action is necessary in conformance with the Court's decision; and (d) file
5
a return with the Court showing compliance with the writ of mandate. Code Civ. Proc. § 1094.5;
6
2. For preliminary and permanent injunctive relief precluding development of the Project
7
until the City has complied with applicable law;
8
3. For reasonable attorney's fees under Code of Civil Procedure § 1021.5;

4. For costs of suit; and
10 5. For such other and further relief as the Court deems proper.
