To Plaintiffs and Others Filing First Papers. If you are filing a first paper (for example, a complaint) in a civil case, you must complete and file, along with your first paper, the Civil Case Cover Sheet contained on page 1. This information will be used to compile statistics about the types and numbers of cases filed. You must complete items 1 through 6 on the sheet. In item 1, you must check one box for the case type that best describes the case. If the case fits both a general and a more specific type of case listed in itern 1, check the more specific one. If the case has multiple causes of action, check the box that best indicates the primary cause of action. To assist you in completing the sheet, examples of the cases that belong under each case type in item 1 are provided below. A cover sheet must be filed only with your initial paper. Failure to file a cover sheet with the first paper filed in a civil case may subject a party, its counsel, or both to sanctions under rules 2.30 and 3.220 of the California Rules of Court.
To Parties in Rule 3.740 Collections Cases. A "collections case" under rule 3.740 is defined as an action for recovery of money

22 INTRODUCTION

23

24 Petitioner BRENTWOOD AUTO SPA, INC., (*Petitioner") respectfully petition this
Court for a Writ of Mandate pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and

25

26 for a declaration of rights directed to the CITY OF BRENTWOOD ("City"), by and through the
City Council, to vacate its approval of the Rotten Robbie Project ("Land Use Permits" or

27

28 "Project"), to set aside the Land Use Permits, to undertake environmental review as required by
the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub.Res.C. §§21000, et. seq., hereafter "CEQA") and

{00173957.}

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1. the State Planning and Zoning Law (Govt. C. §§65000, et. seq., hereafter "Planning and Zoning

2 Law") prior to considering the Land Use Permits for approval. The City's actions in approving

3 the Project on July 28, 2020 violate State and local laws and amount to a prejudicial abuse of

4 discretion. A writ of mandate is necessary to remedy the City's failure to adequately address the

5 Project's environmental impacts, to ensure the City complies with all applicable laws, including

6 laws regarding notice and conduct of public hearings, and to ensure proper review, disclosure,

7 and mitigation of the potential environmental impacts resulting from the approval and

8 development of the Project pursuant to CEQA. By this Petition, Petitioner represents the

9 following:

10 PARTIES

11 1. Petitioner BRENTWOOD AUTO SPA, INC. is a California corporation lawfully

12 authorized to business in California. BRENTWOOD AUTO SPA, INC., owns and operates
13 Brentwood Auto Spa located at 6945 Lone Tree Way in Brentwood, across the street from the
14 Project.

15 2. Respondent CITY OF BRENTWOOD is, and at all times herein mentioned was, a
16| general law city located in the State of California, County of San Joaquin. The City has a duty a to
17 comply with State law requirements, including CEQA, State Planning and Zoning Law, and the
18 Brown Act when considering land use proposals and conducting public hearings thereon.

19 3. Real Party in Interest ROBINSON OIL CORPORATION, INC., ("Robinson") is,
20 identified in the record of proceedings (July 16, 2019, Planning Commission Staff Report and

21 July 31, 2020, Notice of Determination) as the "Owner/Applicant" for the Project. Petitioner is
22 informed and believes Robinson will operate the Rotten Robbie Project once it is completed.

23 Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that Robinson a is a retail petroleum and
24 convenience company headquartered in Santa Clara, California.

25 4. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities, whether individual,
26 corporate, or otherwise, of those Respondents and Real Parties in Interest sued herein as Does
27 through 100 and 101 through 200, respectively. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon

28 alleges that said Respondents and Real Parties in Interest are in some manner responsible for the

(00173957.}
2
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

•

1. adoption of, imposition of, or administration of those laws, ordinances, regulations of which

2 Petitioner complains herein. Petitioner will amend this Petition to set forth the true names and

3 capacities of the fictitiously named Respondents and Real Parties in Interest when such

4 information has been ascertained.

5 5. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each fictitiously

6 named Respondent and Real Party in Interest is responsible in some manner for the occurrences

7 herein alleged.

8 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

9 LAND USE APPROVALS AND PUBLIC HEARINGS

10 A. Application and Planning Commission Approval

11 6. On or about June 20, 2018, Robinson submitted an application to City requesting
12 approval of a Design Review (DR 18-010) and Conditional Use Permit ("CUP") (CUP 18-006)

13 for 7,968+ sq. ft. fueling station canopy, 1,767 sq. ft. car wash, and 4,800+ sq. ft. conveniencel
14 store located on two parcels totaling 2.46t acres at the northwest corner of the intersection of

15 Lone Tree Way and Fairview Avenue in City (APNs: 019-010-043 and 019-010-044.)
16 7. City prepared and circulated a Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") for the
17 Project. A MND is prohibited if there is substantial evidence in the whole record supporting a

18 fair argument that a project may have a significant non-mitigatable effect on the environment. If

19 the lead agency receives such evidence, it must prepare an Environmental Impact Report

20 (EIR)--even if it receives other substantial evidence that the project will not have a significant

21 effect on the environment.

22 8. The Project came before the Planning Commission for a public hearing on or

23 about July 16, 2019. Several persons spoke in opposition to the Project at the July 16, 2019

24 hearing, some alleging the Project would cause the closure of nearby commercial retail spaces.

25 Ultimately, the hearing was continued because a motion to approve the Project failed. Three
26 affirmative votes are required to approve the Project. The vote at the July 16, 2019, Planning

27 Commission Meeting was 2-1, in favor of approving the Project. The Planning Commission

28 continued the hearing on the Project until August 20, 2019.

(00173957.)
3
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

F 9. At the August 20, 2019, public hearing on the Project, the Planning Commission
2 voted to approve the Design Review for the Project (DR 18-010), MND, and CUP (CUP 18-
3 006), Planning Commission Resolution Nos. 19-021, 19-022, and 19-023, respectively, each by a
4 4-0 vote stating that they could not deny a Project that meets the criteria of the Brentwood

5 Municipal Code and the Brentwood General Plan.

6 10. Petitioner filed its notice of appeal to the Planning Commission's approval of the
7 Project on or about August 28, 2020.

8 B. First City Council Meeting (November 12, 2019)

9 11. Petitioner's appeal of the Planning Commissions' approval of the Project (Design
10 Review, MND, and CUP), first came for public hearing before the Brentwood City Council on or
11 about November 12, 2019.

12 12. At the hearing, Petitioner argued that that MND prepared for the Project did not
13 consider potentially significant urban decay impacts and the resulting abandonment of
14 underground storage tanks, resulting in brownfields. Petitioner further argued two other stand-

15 alone car washes were recently approved by the City and the total number of gas stations,
16 combined with the potential reduced need for gasoline due to alternative fuel sources, had a
17 cumulative effect not addressed in the MND.

18 13. Petitioner also introduced an expert report prepared by an economist, Philip King,
19 Ph.D., (the "King Report") which explained that the Project--operating a car wash as a high
20 volume facility, right across the street from Petitioner's existing facility-would create a
21 substantial impact to not only the carwash component of Petitioner, but also to the auto-lube, fuel
22 station, and mini-mart, all which rely on traffic from the car wash. Petitioner noted that when the
23 Arco gas station located at 6481 Lone Tree Way opened a full-service car wash, Petitioner
24 experienced a 10-15% drop in volume.
25 14. Members of the public commented in agreement with Petitioner, arguing that
26 there would be a reduced need for gasoline in the future. Members of the public also commentedl
27 there was a need to ensure that the wall adjacent to the residences behind the Project was high
28 enough.

15. The City Council members expressed concerns regarding the number of existing
2 gas stations and car washes currently in the community, noting that there were seven existing gas
3 stations along Lone Tree Way between Brentwood Boulevard and Heidorn Ranch Road. The

4 City Council members were also concerned with the day-to-day operations of the Project,
5 including its hours of operation and resulting noise impacts to residences on the south side of

6 Lone Tree Way. Members of the Council considered whether the existing wall would mitigate
7 the noise impacts from the Project.

8 16. Due to the concerns with noise from the Project, the City Council ultimately
9 continued the public hearing on Petitioner's appeal to a date uncertain, in order to allow an
10 acoustic engineer to evaluate potential sound impacts from the Project.
11 C. Second City Council Meeting (July 28, 2020)
12 17. After months of analyzing the potential noise impacts from the Project, the City
13 Council placed the continued public hearing on the Project on the agenda for the June 23, 2020,
14 City Council Meeting. The City then continued the hearing until July 28, 2020, as the City failed
15 to notice the June 23, 2020 hearing in the manner required by state law.
16 18. At the July 28, 2020 hearing, Petitioner again argued that the Project, as approved
17 by the Planning Commission (design review, MND, and CUP) failed to consider the potentially
18 significant impacts of the Project, including without limitation, urban decay and the creation of
19 brownfields. Petitioner further noted a letter from its counsel delivered prior to the November
20 12, 2019 hearing on appeal, which included the King Report, had initially been omitted from the
21 Staff Report and the Staff Report failed to provide any meaningful response to the King Report
22 and its conclusions that the Project would cause significant environmental impacts.
23 19. At the hearing, Petitioner again argued that the development of the Project,
24 because of its business model (i.e., high volume and low prices) would have a substantial
25 financial impact on the local business, including the impacts on Tri City Plaza where Petitioner's
26 business is located. Petitioner argued, as previously noted by the owner of Tri-City Plaza, that
27 Petitioner's co-tenants in Tri City Plaza rely on a symbiotic relationship with Petitioner. If
28 Petitioner's business were to close, such closure would have a negative impact on the other

{00173957.)
5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

tenants in Tri City Plaza, and could potentially render those business unprofitable, subjecting
2 them to permanent closure.

3 20. Moreover, Petitioner further summarized the previously introduced King Report.
4 Dr. King noted that California mandated a reduction in fuel consumption by the year 2030-thus
5 reducing the overall need for gas stations. Because of the state mandate, Petitioner argued that
6 over the next 15 years, the City of Brentwood would see several fuel stations close in order to
7 compensate for the decreasing demand. The closed fuel stations would result in brownfields

8 spread throughout the City of Brentwood.

9 21. The brownfields from the abandoned gas stations would also result in abandoned
10 underground storage tanks, potentially leaking petroleum and other effluents into the
11 environment, resulting in what can only be described as an environmental impact.
12 22. Petitioner further argued that with 13 existing gas stations in Brentwood, and 4
13 within 1.1 miles of the Project, urban decay and brownfields would most certainly be the reality
14 for Brentwood in 2030 and beyond. Because of the resulting urban decay and brownfields from
15 the Project, an EIR is required.

16 23. The City Council also considered the noise study conducted by Saxelby Acoustics
17 which determined that the Project would not have significant noise impacts to the area.
18 24. Additionally, members of the public commented again, with many members of
19 the public opposed to the Project.

20 25. The City Council then deliberated the Project. Ultimately, the City Council
21 approved the Project (Design Review, CUP, a and MND), in a 4-1 vote, citing that because the
22 Project was consistent with it the general plan, it must be approved.
23 II. STANDING, EXHAUSTION, AND RIPENESS
24 26. City was presented with substantial evidence of a fair argument that the Project
25 may result in significant environmental effects that had not been adequately studied or mitigated
26 in the MND and that the City failed to proceed in the manner required by law under CEQA and
27 the City's General Plan and zoning laws.
28

{00173957.}
6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

27. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21177 Petitioner has exhausted all

2 administrative remedies concerning the Project. Petitioner commented on the MND, objected to
3 the Project at the Planning Commission and City Council hearings on the Project, appealed from
4 the Planning Commission's decision, presented substantial evidence of a fair argument that the
5 Project may cause significant environmental impacts not adequately addressed in the MND and

6 that the environmental review considered for the Project does not satisfy the minimum
7 requirements of CEQA. Petitioner presented evidence and arguments that the Project and MND
8 do not adequately address the potential impacts of the Project, and therefore an EIR would be

9 required.

10 28. Petitioner has a direct and beneficial interest in the City's full compliance with
11 CEQA and all other applicable laws in approving this Project.
12 29. The City has a mandatory and public duty to comply with CEQA, the City's
13 General Plan and zoning laws, and all other applicable laws when approving the Project.
14 30. As the City has taken final action in adopting the MND, CUP, and Design Review
15 and approving the Project, this claim is ripe for review.
16 31. Petitioner will be directly and substantially affected by the adverse environmental
17 impacts and land use change that may result from the Project.
18 32. Petitioner has standing to bring this action as a business owner and taxpayer in the
19 City who will be directly and adversely affected by the Project's significant impacts and because
20 it seeks to compel a public duty in the form of the City and the Real Party in Interest complying
21 with State and local land use and environmental laws.

22 33. Petitioner will comply with Pub. Res. C. § 21167.5 by mailing written notice of
23 this action to the City.

24 34. Petitioner will comply with Pub. Res. C. § 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure
25 § 388 by notifying the Attorney General of California of the commencement of this action.
26 35. Petitioner does not have a plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary
27 course of law.

28

{00173957.}
7
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

36. A clear and significant benefit will be independently conferred upon the general
2 public by the City fully satisfying the requirements of CEQA, and applicable general plan

3 policies and zoning laws. In instituting this action, Petitioner seeks to procure enforcement of a

4 mandatory duty. Petitioner is vitally and beneficially interested in assuring that the mandate of

5 law is fully satisfied and fulfilled. Granting the relief requested by Petitioner would confer a

6 significant benefit on a large class of persons, in that fundamental rules of law would be affected.

7 37. By the authority of Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5,

8 Government Code sections 65009, and Public Resources Code sections 21168, 21168.5 and

9 21168.9, this Court has jurisdiction to issue a Writ of Mandate to set aside the City's adoption of

10 the MND and approval of the Land Use Permits.

11 38. Venue is proper in this Court because the causes of action alleged in this Petition
12 arose in Contra Costa County where both the Project and the agency that approved the Project

13 are located.

14 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

15 WRIT OF MANDATE CODE CIV. PROC. S§1085, 1094.5, 21168, 21168.5
(Prejudicial Abuse of Discretion: Failure to Prepare EIR As Required by CEQA)
16 39. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained
17 in Paragraphs 1 through 38, above.
18 40. Determination of whether an EIR is required for a project depends upon the "fair

19 argument" test. CEQA requires a public agency to prepare an EIR whenever it can be fairly
20 argued on the basis of substantial evidence that the project may have significant environmental
21 impact. If substantial evidence of such impact exists in the record, contrary evidence is not
22 adequate to support a decision to dispense with an EIR.
23 41. The City received, from Petitioner and others, substantial evidence of a fair
24 argument that the Project may cause significant environmental impacts in the form of
25 commercial business closures, urban decay, and resulting brownfields.
26 42. For example, Petitioner and others presented substantial evidence that, building
27 another gas station and a car a wash directly across the street from an existing car wash will result
28 in urban decay and resulting brownfields from such closures.

{00173957.)
8
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

43. The City further violated CEQA by failing to consider the cumulative impacts of
2 related projects, processed concurrently with the Project, including the two other car washes/gas
3 station combinations that came before the Planning Commission on July 16, 2019.

4 44. The County committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in
5 the manner required by law in adopting a MND rather than an EIR.

6 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

7 WRIT OF MANDATE-CODE CIV. PROC. 8§ 1085, 1094.5

8 (Prejudicial Abuse of Discretion: Adopting CUP in Violation of Planning & Zoning Laws)
45. Petitioner realleges and incorporates herein by reference the allegations contained
in Paragraphs 1 through 44, above.
10
46.
11 State Planning and Zoning Law prohibits a City from approving a project that is

12 inconsistent with that City's general plan or zoning laws.
47.
13 Petitioner presented substantial evidence that the Project is inconsistent with the

14 City's Planning and Zoning Laws including having "harmful effects...upon desirable

15 neighborhood character or the planned specialization of retail [and] commercial [uses]"

16 (Brentwood Municipal Code § 17.830.005.), including urban decay to the area surrounding the
Project and the eventual creation of brownfields.
17
48.
18 Notwithstanding the Project's conflict with the City's land use laws, City

19 prejudicially abused its discretion and acted in an arbitrary and capricious manner by approving
the Project.
20
49.
21 The City's action in approving the Project despite the inconsistencies with the

22 City's planning and zoning laws is improper. In order for the City to approve the Project, the
Project must be modified, or the general plan must be amended. 23
PRAYER FOR RELIEF
24 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays as follows:
25 1.
26 That this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate:
a. Commanding the City to immediately set aside and vacate its decision to 27

28 approve the MND and the CUP, as memorialized in Notice of Determination filed on July 31,

{00173957.}
9
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1. 2020, including the finding that the Project does not require an EIR and the Project is consistent

. 2 with City planning and zoning laws;

3 b. Commanding the City and Real Parties in Interest to immediately suspend all
4 activities in furtherance of the Project, including but not limited to issuing building and grading
5 permits;

6 c. Commanding the City to comply with CEQA and State Planning and Zoning
7 Law in any subsequent action(s) taken to approve the Project;

8 2. a For a stay, temporary restraining order, and/or preliminary and permanent
injunction restraining the City and the Real Parties in Interest (including any successors or
10 agents), or any other Real Parties in Interest, from taking any action to carry out the Project and
11 implement the Land Use Permits pending the outcome of this litigation;
12 3. That Petitioner be awarded the costs incurred in bringing this action, and
13 reasonable attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure 1021.5, the "common benefit"
14 theory, Government Code section 800, or as otherwise provided by law or equity.
15 4. That the Court grant such other and further relief as may be just and proper.
