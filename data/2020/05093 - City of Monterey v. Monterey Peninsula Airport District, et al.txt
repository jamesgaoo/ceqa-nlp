PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

INTRODUCTION

2 1. Petitioner CITY OF MONTEREY ("City" or "Petitioner") petitions this Court for a Writ of
3 | Mandate ("Petition"), directed to Respondents MONTEREY PENINSULA AIRPORT DISTRICT and
MONTEREY PENINSULA AIRPORT DISTRICT BOARD OF DIRECTORS ("District" or
5 "Respondents"). This action challenges Respondents' August 12, 2020, decisions to: (1) approve the
6 Modified November 26, 2018, Final Airport Master Plan ("Modified Plan" or "Modified Project"); and
7 (2) adopt the August 2020 Addendum to the Final Airport Master Plan Environmental Impact Report
8 (*EIR") (State Clearinghouse House No. 2015121105) ("Addendum") without first preparing and
9 certifying a supplemental or subsequent EIR as required.
10 2. The District's actions violate the provisions governing subsequent environmental review in the
11 California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). (See Pub. Resources Code, § 21166, subd. (a); see
12 also Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, div. 6, ch. 3 ["CEQA Guidelines"], §§ 15162, subd. (a)(1), 15164, subd.
13|| (a).) The District's actions will result in environmental impacts that have not been adequately
14 considered, analyzed, and mitigated. Therefore, any project approvals and other entitlements that rely
15 on the Addendum must be overturned. Petitioner seeks a writ directing Respondents to set aside their
16 adoption of the Addendum and approval of the Modified Project until such time that Respondents
17 demonstrate full compliance with CEQA.

18 PARTIES

19 3. Petitioner City of Monterey is a municipal corporation located within the County of Monterey.
20 The City is contiguous with the Monterey Regional Airport and surrounds it to the east, south, and
21 west. As a result, the City has a vested interest in ensuring that all environmental impacts of the
22 Modified Project are fully disclosed, analyzed, and mitigated to the extent feasible to protect the City's
23 residents.

24 4. Respondent the District is the CEQA "lead agency" for the Modified Project for purposes of
25 Public Resources Code section 21067, and has principal responsibility for conducting environmental
26 review prior to considering and approving any discretionary modifications to its November 26, 2018
27 Final Airport Master Plan and taking other actions necessary to comply with CEQA. The District is a
28 California special district responsible for all operation, maintenance, and planning for the Monterey

1
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

•*

Regional Airport, which provides both commercial and general aviation services.

2 5. Respondents' Board governs the District and is comprised of locally elected Board members

3 who vote on project approvals and adoption/certification of CEQA documents.

4 6. The City currently does not know the true names of Respondents DOES 1 through 10 and Real
5 Parties DOES 11 through 20, inclusive, and therefore names them by such fictitious names. The City

6 will seek leave from the court to amend this petition to reflect the true names and capacities of DOES
through 20 inclusive if and when ascertained.

8 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

7. The Monterey County Superior Court has jurisdiction over matters alleged in this Petition
10 pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections

11 21168 and 21168.5.

12 8. Venue is proper in the Monterey County Superior Court in accordance with Code of Civil
13 Procedure section 395 because the Modified Project at issue is located in the County of Monterey.

14 9. Venue is proper in the Monterey County Superior Court under Code of Civil Procedure sections
15 394 and 395 because Respondents include a local agency based in the County of Monterey and because
16 the cause of action alleged in this Petition arose in the County of Monterey and the Modified Project
17 will occur within the County of Monterey.

18 STANDING

19 10. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims alleged in this Petition because it is "beneficially
20 interested" in this matter pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1086. Petitioner has a direct and
21|| beneficial interest in Respondents' compliance with laws bearing upon approval of the Modified
22 Project, an action which violates the law as set forth in this Petition, because such approval will result
23 in substantial harm to quality of life in the surrounding community over which the City has jurisdiction.
24 In addition, unless the relief requested herein is granted, the natural environment will be adversely
25 affected and injured by Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA when adopting the Addendum and
26 approving the Modified Project.
27| ///

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
11 . Petitioner has performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition. Petitioner has
3 actively participated in the administrative and environmental review process associated with the

4 Modified Project and Addendum before the issuance of the notice of determination ("NOD"). This
participation includes, but is not limited to, all correspondence asserted in paragraphs 27 to 29 of this
6 Petition. Petitioner has fully exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law. (Pub.
Resources Code, § 21177, subd. (a).)
12. Respondents have taken final agency actions adopting the Addendum and approving the
9 Modified Project. Respondents had a mandatory duty to comply with all applicable laws, including, but
10 not limited to CEQA prior to undertaking the discretionary approvals at issue in this lawsuit. Petitioner
11 possesses no effective remedy to challenge the Adoption and Approval at issue in this action other than
12|| by means of this lawsuit.

13 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

14 13. On August 12, 2020, the Board adopted the Addendum, approved the Modified Project, and
15 filed and posted an NOD for those actions.

16 14. The statute of limitations under CEQA to bring a challenge to Respondents' decision to adopt
17 the Addendum expires 30 days from the filing and posting of the NOD. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15094,
18 subd. (g), 15112, subd. (c)(1).) The 30th day after the August 12, 2020 NOD falls on Friday, September
19 11, 2020. This petition is timely filed on or before that date.
20 NOTICE OF CEQA SUIT

21 15. On September 9, 2020, Petitioner served a notice of their intent to file this lawsuit to
22 Respondents, in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.5. (See Exhibit 1; Notice of
23 Intent to File Petition Pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act.)
24 16. Petitioner will furnish a copy of this Petition on the California Department of Justice, Office of
25 the Attorney General, in accordance with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil
26 Procedures section 388, and file an appropriate notice with this Court.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

PREPARATION OF ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

2 17. Pursuant to Public Resources Code, section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), Petitioner elects to
3 prepare the record of proceedings in this action. Notice of this election has been filed with this Petition.
ATTORNEYS' FEES
18. Petitioner is entitled to attorneys' fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 1021.5 and
6 1032 because Petitioner brings this action to enforce important rights affecting the public interest such
that:

Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit on the general
public by requiring Respondents to carry out their duties under CEQA and other applicable laws
10 before approving the Modified Project. By compelling Respondents to engage in a legally
11 adequate analysis of the Modified Project, the public will have a meaningful opportunity to
12 review and comment on the impacts and mitigation measures for the Modified Project. Issuance
13 of relief will also confer specific significant benefit on the constituents of the City of
14 Monterey who will be significantly negatively impacted by the Modified Project should it be
15 implemented as approved.

16 attorneys' fees appropriate The necessity and financial burden of enforcement make an award of

17 in this case. Without this Petition, Respondents will implement the Modified Project and enact
18 development and changes in the physical environment that will cause significant, unmitigated
19 environmental and related impacts that might otherwise have been reduced or avoided through
20 legally adequate environmental review and the adoption of feasible mitigation measures or
21 alternatives.

22 IRREPARABLE HARM

23 19. Petitioner's constituents live and/or work near the Modified Project site in the City of Monterey
24 within the County of Monterey. They have been and will continue to be harmed by Respondents'
25 failure to provide an environmental document that accurately and fully informs interested persons of
26 the Modified Project's true impacts, and mitigates those impacts. Such documents would lead to better
27 environmental decision making regarding the Modified Project, and would enable all residents, land
28  owners, and business owners in the affected region to better understand the true environmental impacts

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

of the Modified Project and provide meaningful comments.
20. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless this
require Respondents to set aside their approval of the 3 Court grants the requested writ of mandate to
4 Modified Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' decisions will remain in effect in
5 violation of State law and Petitioner will be irreparably harmed. No monetary damages or legal remedy

6 could fully and adequately compensate Petitioner for that harm. The District has the capacity to correct
7 its violations of law but refused to do so before taking the actions challenged in this petition.
8 FACTUAL BACKGROUND
9 21. The paragraphs below refer to and rely on information in documents relating to this action, alle
10 of which will be filed with this Court as part of the record of proceedings and are here incorporated by
11 reference.

12 22. The originally proposed Airport Master Plan ("Project") was evaluated in the November 2018
13 Airport Master Plan EIR (State Clearinghouse No. 2015121105) ("2018 EIR*) and intended to provide
14"a development framework to implement improvements that would enable the Monterey Regional
15 Airport (Airport) to accommodate future demand for forecasted air travel." (2018 EIR, p. ES-1.) The
16 2018 EIR analyzed the proposed Project and several project alternatives. Ultimately, Respondents, as
17 the lead agency for CEQA review, approved Alternative 1 as the Monterey Regional Airport Master
18|| Plan ("AMP") and certified the 2018 EIR on November 26, 2018.

19 23. The approved Alternative 1 "retains all the major projects of the Proposed Project" and, in
20 relevant part here, included the near-term construction and operation of a new, publicly accessible,
21 North Side Road "to remove the need for additional traffic to use Airport Road, even in the short term"
22 and the relocation of the existing aircraft rescue and firefighting ("ARFF") facility to the north side of
23 the Airport to continue to be jointly used by the City. (2018 EIR, pp. 3-22, 3-25, 4.14-10.) Alternative
24 2, conversely, omitted the North Side Road, but otherwise "would construct the Proposed Project." (Id.,
25 Ip. 3-36.) Because it did not include the North Side Road, Alternative 2 was found to have "Significant
26 and Unavoidable" land use and planning impacts that Alternative 1 did not have, as well as increased
27 operational traffic.on Airport Road that would require "in-depth traffic analysis" should the alternative
28| be chosen. (Id.; pp. 3-44 to 3-45.) But, at that time, Alternative 2 was not selected.

5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

24. Petitioner, as a neighboring municipality whose residents would be negatively impacted by
2 increased traffic on and near Airport Road, publicly supported Alternative 1 and requested in an
October 16, 2018, comment letter that the North Side Road be "the first project constructed" to

4 eliminate the immediate "construction traffic through a single family [] residential neighborhood,"

5 Casanova Oak Knoll ("CONA"), within its jurisdiction. (2018 EIR, Final, pp. 3A-18 to 3A-19.)

6 25. At some point after Respondents' approval and certification actions on November 26, 2018, it
7 was determined that "minor changes and project modification to the approved AMP [i.e., Alternative 1]

8 are beneficial" and public notice for the Addendum was posted on the District's website on August 7,
9 2020. (District, Environmental Impact Report (EIR) on the Approved Airport Master Plan (Aug. 7,
10 2020) < http://montereyeir.airportstudy.com/> [as accessed Sept. 9, 2020].)
11 26. However, as demonstrated in this Petition, the changes approved by Respondents are not minor,
12 as they claim. In relevant part, the Modified Project will ostensibly eliminate the publicly accessible
13 North Side Road by postponing its construction and use as such to some unknown and unarticulated
14 future date, similarly or the same to the original Alternative 2. (Addendum, p. 1; see  23.) It also will
15 postpone the relocation of the ARFF facility and remove it from future "joint-use I1 with the City of
16 Monterey" in contrast to analytical assumptions made in 2018 EIR (Ibid; see 2018 EIR, p. 4.14-10.)
17 The consequences of these major changes are the source of Respondents' CEQA violations and
18 discussed accordingly below.

19 27. A public Board meeting was held on August 12, 2020, at 9 a.m. where the matter was
20 considered. City representatives were in attendance and submitted oral comments of the same substance
21 as their written comments that followed. That same day, the Modified Project was approved, the
22 Addendum adopted, and the NOD posted. (See 11 l, 11.) With such a short time between the release of
23 the Addendum and its adoption (five days total), Petitioner was not able to provide written comments
24 until August 11, 2020, wherein each CEQA violation discussed below was raised in a comment letter
25 submitted on behalf of Petitioner to Respondents.

26 28. Mayor Clyde Roberson wrote again to Respondents on August 21, 2020, urging them to
27 reconsider their August 12th actions and reiterating Petitioner's concerns set forth in this Petition.
28 Respondents rejected that request.

6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

29. The Project and Modified Project are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act
2 ("NEPA") because of Federal Aviation Administration (*FAA") oversight and approval. (2018 EIR, p.

3 1-1.) The FAA did not prepare a federal environmental document for the original Project, or

4 presumably the Modified Project, because, as stated, "[e]nvironmental analysis under federal
5 regulations will occur when FAA considers a development project for federal funding and/or project

6 approval. (Ibid.) The FAA did, however, prepare an environmental assessment ("EA") for a specific
7 Airport safety enhancement project in March 2020. Petitioners dutifully commented on the EA with the
8 same concerns raised in their comments on the Addendum, and formally submitted those written
9 comments to Respondents in an April 28, 2020, letter. These comments included responses from the
10 City's Traffic Engineering Division, wherein potentially significant traffic impacts to the CONA
11 neighborhood were preliminarily quantified for the scenario in which North Side Road is not made
12 publicly accessible (an estimated increase of 6,933 trips per day with more than 950 trips during both
13 AM and PM peak hours) and potentially significant impacts to nearby intersections were defined along
14 with the need for mitigation measures.

15 CEQA CAUSES OF ACTION

16 (Violations of CEQA: Failure to Prepare a Subsequent EIR)
17 Substantial evidence shows that a subsequent EIR must be prepared for the Modified Project.

18 30. Section 15164, subdivision (a), of the CEQA Guidelines orders the preparation of an addendum
19 only when "some changes or additions are necessary but none of the conditions described in Section
20 | 15162 calling for the preparation of a subsequent EIR have occurred." (See Friends of College of San
21 Mateo Gardens v. San Mateo County Community College Dist. (2016) 1 Cal.5th 937, 945-946
22 ("Friends of College of San Mateo Gardens').) Section 15162 calls for the preparation of a subsequent
23 EIR when, as it pertains here: "Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major
24 revisions of the previous EIR or negative declaration due to the involvement of new significant
25 environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant
26 effects." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15162, subd. (a)(1); Pub. Resources Code, § 21166; see Friends of
27 College of San Mateo Gardens, supra, (2016). 1 Cal.5th at pp. 949-950.) As explained below,
28 conditions described in subdivision (a)(1) of section 15162 of the CEQA Guidelines apply here and,

7
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

therefore, a subsequent EIR is required, contrary to Respondents' assertions. (See Addendum, pp:
2 39-40.) As result, provisions in section 15164 that allow preparation of an addendum are inapposite.
3 The Modified Project will result in new and/or severely increased significant impacts to land

4 use/planning and transportation/traffic as shown in the 2018 EIR and therefore a subsequent
EIR must be prepared.

6 31. With the Modified Plan, Respondents purport to eliminate the public access portion of the North
Side Road from Phase 1, which will have dramatic traffic impacts on the City and on the residents in
up to two the CONA neighborhood. (See 11 23, 26, 29.) CONA residents will be forced to endure
9 decades of substantially increasing Airport-related traffic until such time that the North Side Road is
10 fully constructed, if it ever is constructed.1 (See Addendum, pp. 1, 4; see also 11 24, 29.) This traffic,
11 which would otherwise be routed through the new North Side Road under Alternative 1 (i.e., the
12 originally adopted Project alternative) will continue to "go west through CONA." (2018 EIR, p. 3-44;
13 see 1 23, 29 [estimated increase of 6,933 trips per day with more than 950 trips during AM and PM
14 peak hours].) This long-term traffic increase presents at least two new potentially significant impacts
15 that are recognized in the 2018 EIR and which trigger the CEQA requirement to prepare a subsequent
16|| EIR. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15162, subd. (a)(1).)
17 32. Potentially significant impacts are first discussed in the "Land Use and Planning" analysis for
18 Alternative 2 (i.e., the Project alternative that omits construction of the new North Side Road) in the
19 2018 EIR. (See 11 23, 26.) There, the 2018 EIR states that the decision of "eliminating the new "north
20|| side' road" would have "Potentially Significant and Unavoidable impacts" because there would be
21  "significant policy inconsistencies with the applicable City of Monterey [GJeneral Plan and CONA
22 Neighborhood Plan goals and policies related to vehicular traffic from the Airport via the CONA
23 neighborhood," including GP Circulation Element Policy b-5, Policy c.8, Policy i.7, and Goal j; GP
24 Noise Element Goal a; and CONA Neighborhood Plan Policies 15, 16, 29, and 34. (2018 EIR, pp. 3-43
25 to 3-44.) The Modified Project de facto eliminates the North Side Road by postponing its construction
26

27 In a letter dated August 21, 2020, sent from the City to the Board, City Mayor Clyde Roberson expressed concern about comments made by Board Chair Mary Ann Leffel during a March 25, 2020, 28 City Council meeting for the City of Del Rey Oaks, wherein the Chair publicly stated that there was 10 plan for construction of the North Side Road.

8
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

for up to two decades, or maybe indefinitely, thereby in essence implementing Alternative 2, instead of
the approved Alternative 1. (See fn. 1; T 23.) This action creates new potentially significant and
3 unavoidable land use and planning impacts that must be analyzed in a subsequent EIR. (CEQA
Guidelines, § 15162, subd. (a)(1).) Further, if there is no plan to construct North Side Road, as has been
5  indicated by Respondents (see fn. 1), that fact would constitute "new information of substantial
6 importance" that was unknown at the time of the 2018 EIR and would create a significant effect not
7 discussed in the previous EIR, which must then be analyzed in a subsequent EIR. (Id., subd. (a)(3)(A);
8 see Moss v. County of Humboldt (2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 1041, 1058.)
9 33. Potentially significant impacts are then discussed in the "Transportation/Traffic" analysis for
10| the omission of the North Side Road, where the 2018 EIR states that an "in-depth traffic analysis with
11 the distribution of long-term traffic from the north side through the CONA neighborhood would be
12 required to fully determine the extent and significance of this impact," which "would be greater" than
13 under the originally proposed Project and Alternative 1. (2018 EIR, p. 3-45.) The 2018 EIR goes on to
14 state that there also would be an increase in construction traffic through the CONA neighborhood
15  beyond that analyzed under the Alternative 1 scenario, and, as a result of all of these traffic increases,
16 "[m]itigation...would be necessary." (Ibid.) Because full construction of the North Side Road is
17 considered now to be a "long-term project," if it ever is constructed (see fn. 1), any future traffic
18 generated by its omission-by definition- -is "long-term traffic" of the exact type determined in 2018
19 EIR to require "in-depth traffic analysis." (Addendum, p. 4 [Exhibit 2].) Moreover, by requiring
20 additional traffic studies and mitigation, it is made clear that the traffic increase resulting from
21 implementation of the Modified Project will create a potentially significant impact, otherwise such
22 measures would not be necessary. (See Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa, Inc. v. 32nd Dist.
23 Agricultural Assn. (1986) 42 Cal.3d 929, 937 ("Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa") [increases in
24 "acoustic effects" and "seating capacity" of a fairground amphitheater "were sufficiently important to
25 require consideration of their effects in a later EIR"]; a see also 1 29 [presenting preliminary data on
26 traffic increase through CONA].)

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

34. Further evidence of substantial increases in traffic can be found in Table 16 of the Addendum,

2 which shows an increase of 92 weekday average daily trips resulting from the Modified Project.2 These

3 trips, however, are not at all analyzed in the long-term scenario, which is a glaring omission

4 considering that: (a) they would occur in the long-term-for up to 20 years until the North Side Road is

5 completed for public access (if it ever is); and (b) several intersections and roadways surrounding the

6 Project site already operate at unacceptable levels during peak hours. (Addendum, pp. 37-38; 2018
7 EIR, pp. 4.16-20 to 4.16-21; see American Canyon Community United for Responsible Growth v. City
8 of American Canyon (2006) 145 Cal. App.4th 1062, 1080-1081 (*American Canyon Community") ["a
9 30-trip increase could have a significant effect" on intersections already operating at subpar levels
10 thereby the lead agency's "determination that that the [project] would not have significant traffic
11 effect...is not supported by substantial evidence"].) These new potentially significant traffic impacts
12 must be analyzed in a subsequent EIR or the public will be deprived "of any meaningful assessment of
13 the actual project chosen by the agency." (Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa, supra, 42 Cal.3d at p.
14| 938; CEQA Guidelines, § 15162, subd. (a)(1).)

15 35. The Addendum omits mention of the above 2018 EIR conclusions entirely. The required in-
16 depth traffic analysis did not occur nor did any discussion of inconsistency with applicable land use and
17 planning policies and plans; there was no additional traffic mitigation presented. (See Addendum, pp.
18 37-38.) In fact, the Addendum does nothing at all to address the long-term impacts of the Modified

19

20 The Addendum attempts to offset these 92 new traffic trips with a reduction in trips resulting from the elimination of month-to-month landscaping storage operations at the ARFF, but this is problematic for 21 several reasons. (Addendum, p. 37 [Table 16].) For one, the 122 weekday vehicle trips attributed to the
22 elimination of this landscaping storage are not categorized as such in the traffic memo prepared for the Addendum. (See Id., Appendix D.). In fact, the trips appear to be associated largely with the onsite 23 towing company, not landscaping storage. (See Id., p. D-6.) Also, this storage elimination is not listed in the project description, although it is treated as part of the Modified Project. (See Id., pp. 5-6.) It is 24 discussed and utilized throughout the analysis in an effort to demonstrate a reduction in impacts below those established in the 2018 EIR, yet there is no guarantee that it actually will occur nor is a timeline 25| for implementation provided. (See Addendum, pp. 13, 24, 26-31, 36-37.) It is never properly
26 described, and it is not included in the original or modified Mitigation, Monitoring, and Reporting Plan (*MMRP"). This calls into question the accuracy of the Addendum's project description and any 27 analysis and impact conclusions associated with this eliminated storage.
(Stopthemillenniumhollywood.com v. City of Los Angeles (2019) 39 Cal.App.5th 1, 17 ["an 28 accurate...and finite project description as the sine qua non of an informative and legally sufficient [CEQA document]".)

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Project and makes the claims that "[i]n the long-term, [l programmatic traffic analysis contained in the
2 [2018 EIR] is not changed by the proposed Project modifications" and that consistency with the
"Monterey GP Circulation Element" and CONA policies "are the same as the Approved Project."
4 (Addendum, p. 38.) (See Mani Brothers Real Estate Group v. City of Los Angeles (2007) 153
5 Cal.App.4th 1385, 1402 ["a]s with all substantial evidence issues, [a challenger] must...show why it is
6 lacking"]). This claim is not just conclusory, it is wrong and directly contradicts Respondents' claims in
7 2018.

8 36. It is anomalous that a lead agency could believe both that these exact changes would result in
9 potentially significant impacts such that additional analysis and mitigation is required and also that
10| prior analysis is adequate and the impacts are the same as before. Respondents have not accounted for

11 this incongruity, although Petitioner raised it on several occasions during the preparation of the
12 Addendum and after its publication. (See 11 27-29, infra.) In fact, this is a longstanding concern that
13 Respondents have been informed of for years. Petitioner has long been vocal about the potentially
14 significant impacts of increased traffic in the CONA neighborhood that would occur without buildout
15 of the North Side Road. (See 2018 EIR, p. 3-20 [*"[t]he City of Monterey and the CONA neighborhood
16 are strongly opposed to more Airport-related traffic being introduced into [their neighborhood]"]; see
17 also  24, infra.)

18 37. Thus, Respondents were well aware of these potentially significant impacts, but, instead of
19 properly addressing them in a subsequent EIR as required under CEQA, they opted for truncated
20 analysis in the Addendum that lacks substantial evidence to support its conclusory findings. A CEQA
21 lead agency is supposed to look at "substantial evidence in light of the whole record" to determine
22 whether or not to prepare a subsequent EIR." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15162, subd. (a); see American
23 Canyon Community, supra, 145 Cal. App.4th at p. 1072.) And yet, Respondents failed to look even to
24 their own EIR to properly inform their Addendum analysis and conclusions. Put broadly, identifying :
25 these changes as a mere modification of the approved Project, instead of a near complete shift to an
26 alternative project, "is more misleading than if the agency has prepared no EIR, since the public might
27 justifiably but erroncously assume that the project being built is the one discussed in the EIR."
28 (Concerned Citizens of Costa Mesa, supra, 42 Cal.3d at p. 938.) To put it in exacting CEQA terms, the

11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- Modified Project is a substantial change from the original, approved Project which results in new
2 impacts and/or a substantial increase in severity of previously identified impacts, which then triggers
3 the mandatory preparation of a subsequent EIR. (Id., § 15162, subd. (a)(1).)

4

5 The Modified Project will create a new potentially significant impact on public services and
therefore a subsequent EIR must be prepared.

6 38. With the Modified Plan, Respondents purport to postpone the relocation of the ARFF facility
7 and it preclude it from being a joint-use facility with the City, thusly necessitating the construction of a
8 new City fire station in order to maintain acceptable response times to the areas currently serviced, and
9| planned to be serviced, by a joint-use facility. (See 11 23, 26.) Construction of a new facility could
10 result in a potentially significant impact(s) that must be analyzed in a subsequent EIR. (CEQA
11 Guidelines, § 15162, subd. (a)(1).) The 2018 EIR includes the ARFF facility as one that provides
12 structural response units for off-airport emergencies to the east of the Airport" through a "mutual aid
13 agreement with the City of Monterey." (2018 EIR, pp. 4.14-6 to 4.14-7.) The 2018 EIR explicitly
14 considered "off-airport response times" in relation to whether the originally approved Project would
15 have "substantial adverse physical impacts associated with the provision of new or physically altered
16 government facilities, construction of which could cause significant environmental impacts, in order to
17 maintain acceptable...response times, or other performance objectives for...fire protection." (Id., pp.
18 4.14-8 to 4.14-10, quoting in part CEQA Guidelines, appen. G, § XV(a).) In a turn of course, the
19 Addendum only addresses impacts to "on-airport fire protection" in direct contrast to assumptions
20 made in the 2018 EIR (Addendum, pp. 33, 37.) This dramatic Project change is not properly addressed

21 in the Addendum-a meaningful oversight in its own right--but, even if it were addressed, that would
22 fall short of what CEQA requires, as explained below.

23 39. The removal of the ARFF facility as a joint-use facility under the Modified Plan would result in
24 "off-airport response times" of up to nine minutes3 to certain areas of the City.4 (2018 EIR, p. 4.14-10.)

25

26

27 3 This nine-minute response time was determined by the City of Monterey Fire Chief Gaudenz Panholzer and conveyed to Respondents in the City's August 11, 2020, letter commenting on the 28 Addendum. A response letter submitted the next day to the City from the firm of Gatzke Dillon & Balance LLP on behalf of Respondents does not refute Chief Panholzer's assessment.
12
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

This extended response time was deemed a significant and unavoidable impact in the 2018 EIR, and it
remains the same now. (2018 EIR, p. 4.14-9 ['the suggested response time is five minutes or less" thus
"longer response times...would be a Significant and Unavoidable impact"].) Moreover, it is
unacceptable to the City and would directly result in the City constructing a new fire station to ensure
5 appropriate and equitable service to those negatively impacted communities.
40. By Respondents' own methodology and thresholds of significance, the construction of this new
7 City fire station would upgrade one impact to potentially significant because construction of a new
8 facility would cause, at least, some significant environmental impacts, and would ensure another impact
9 remain significant and unavoidable, as it was classified in the 2018 EIR, because of the increase in
10 response times until the construction of a new facility could occur.› (See 2018 EIR, pp. 4.14-5, 4.14-8,
11 4.14-9; see also CEQA Guidelines, § 5064, subd. (d) ["the lead agency shall consider direct physical
12 changes in the environment which may be caused by the project"].) This new potentially significant
13 impact was not accurately identified in either the 2018 EIR or the Addendum, and it changes the nature
14 of the development such that the Modified Project must be analyzed in a subsequent EIR. (CEQA
15 Guidelines, § 15162, subd. (a)(1); see American Canyon Community, supra, 145 Cal. App.4th at p.
16 1078; see also CEQA Guidelines, appen. G, § XV(a).)
17 ///

18 ///

20 4 The new ARFF facility that was proposed and approved in the original Project would have been
21 "located only 1,250 feet west" of the existing facility and would maintain a "nearly identical response time" as under existing conditions, which would, therefore, result in no "adverse physical impacts…..associated with the provision of new government facilities" that must be constructed "in order 22 to maintain acceptable...response times." (2018 EIR, pp. 14.4-8 to 14.4-10.) The Modified Project will
231 I result in the exact opposite effects. 5 In Respondents' August 11, 2020, response letter submitted to the City (see fn. 3), Respondents fail to 24 address their own threshold of significance for this impact as contained in Section 4.14.5.1 of the 2018
25 EIR, which clearly states that the provision of new government facilities required to maintain fire protection response times are potentially significant if they "could cause significant environmental
26 impacts." Instead, Respondents merely speculate that any fire station constructed within City limits would not result in a significant impact and assert that, in any event, they are not obliged to provide 27 mitigation for the City's need for additional fire services. However, Respondents base their former. assertion on unevidenced assumptions, and their latter assertion does not address the most relevant 28 issue here- whether the Modified Project would create a new potentially significant impact, which it would as established herein.
