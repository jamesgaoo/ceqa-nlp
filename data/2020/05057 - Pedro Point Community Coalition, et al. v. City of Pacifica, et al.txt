INTRODUCTION

3 1. On June 22, 2020, the City Council of the City of Pacifica ("City") approved an

4 application of San Pedro Valley, LLC on property owned by the Frances E. Christen Trust for

5 demolition of an existing single-family residence, detached garage, and barn, and construction

6 of a 1,753 square-foot, two-story single-family residence, a 236 square-foot detached garage,

7 and a 216 square-foot carport on a 3,516 square foot-lot at 277 Kent Road ("Project"). The

8 applicant is also developing property at 1300 Danmann Ave, which is contiguous with and has

9 been merged with the parcel for the project. The parcel for the proposed Project ("277 Kent

10 Parcel") is a sub-standard lot that was merged with the 1300 Danmann Parcel in 1985. The

11 1300 Danmann Ave Parcel is being concurrently proposed for a mixed-use development

12 consisting of commercial development and an additional six residential uses that has been

13 approved by the Planning Commission is on appeal to the City Council.

14 2. Respondents determined that the Project is not subject to the California

15 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"-Pub. Resources Code ยง 21000 et seq.) claiming that the

16 Project is categorically exempt from CEQA under Sections 15303 "New Construction or

17 Conversion of Small Structures."

18 3. Petitioners Pedro Point Community Coalition and Allison West ("Petitioners")

19 challenge the approval of the Project and adoption of the Categorial Exemption under CEQA

20 because the Project does not fall within the scope of these exemptions. See Save Our Big Trees

21 V. City of Santa Cruz (2015) 241 Cal.App.4th 694, 707; Mountain Lion Foundation v. Fish &

22 Game Com. (1997) 16 Cal.4th 105, 125; Wildlife Alive v. Chickering (1976) 18 Cal.3d 190,

23 205. More importantly, the City piecemealed the project because the applicant is proposing the

24 Project and has proposed further development on the 1300 Dannman Parcel. CEQA requires

25 agencies to analyze "the whole of an action, which has a potential for resulting in either a

26 direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change

27 in the environment... ." ยง 14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง 15378(a). If the whole of the action is

28 considered, the Project does not qualify for the claimed exemption. Furthermore, the Project

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
2

violates the Subdivision Map Act and the Pacifica City Code in that the 277 Kent Parcel is not

2 a separate legal parcel because it was merged with the parcel located at 1300 Danmann.
3 4. On July 10, 2020, the City staff purportedly filed a Notice of Exemption, and,

4 pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21167, this action was filed within 35 days thereof.

5 However, while Petitioner Allison West requested a copy of the Notice of Exemption, the City

6 could only produce an unexecuted copy of the Notice of Exemption that is dated July 10, 2020

7 and the City represented to Ms. West that the unexecuted version was the Notice of Exemption

8 that was executed. Nonetheless, within 35 days of July 10, 2020, and this matter has been
timely filed particularly in light of the Judicial Council's tolling of statute of limitations in

10 these types of civil actions until August 3, 2020.

11

12 II

13 PARTIES

14 5. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 4 as if fully

15 set forth herein.

16 6. Pedro Point Community Coalition is an unincorporated association of residents

17 and taxpayers of the City of Pacifica and the County of San Mateo. Petitioner Pedro Point

18 Community Coalition has a strong interest in preservation of the environment, the coastal

19 environment, and the character of the Pedro Point Community Coalition, and include residents
20 affected by the Project and whose interests will be adversely affected by the violations of

21 CEQA, the Subdivision Map Act and the City Code. Petitioner Pedro Point Community

22 Coalition and its members submitted comments on the Project that addressed the lack of
23 environmental review and violations of law before the Planning Commission and the City

24 Council.

25 7. Petitioner Allison West is an individual dedicated to the protection of the
26 environment in the City of Pacifica and the County of San Mateo by participating in local

27 environmental and land use policy and decision making. Petitioner Allison West is a resident a

28 of the City of Pacifica and the County of San Mateo and is affected by the Project, and whose

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
3

1 interests in preservation of the ecological integrity of the City and County will be adversely

2 affected by the lack of environmental review under CEQA, violations of the Subdivision Map

3 Act, and the Pacifica City Code, and by approval of the Project. Petitioner Allison West

4 participated at public hearings, appealed the Project to the City Council, and submitted
comments on the Project.

6 8. Respondent City of Pacifica, through Respondent City Council of the City of

7 Pacifica (collectively, "Respondents"), is a political subdivision of the State of California. On

8 June 22, 2020, Respondents gave final approval to the Project and determined the Project to be
categorically exempt from the provisions of CEQA.

10 9. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise, of

11 Does 1-15 are unknown to Petitioners who therefore sue said Respondents by such fictitious

12 names and will seek leave to amend this Petition when their identities have been ascertained.

13 10. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Respondents
14 and each of them were the agents and employees of each of the remaining Respondents and

15 while doing the things herein alleged, were acting within the course and scope of such agency

16 and employment.

17 11. Real Party in Interest, San Pedro Valley, LLC, is the applicant and properly

18 named as a Real Party in Interest pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5(a),

19 which states Petitioners shall name as a Real Party in Interest any person or persons identified
20 in the Notice of Exemption filed by Respondents.

21 12. Real Party in Interest, Frances E. Christen Trust, is the owner of the 277 Kent

22 Parcel.

23 13. The true names and capacities, whether individual, corporate, or otherwise, of

24 Does 16 through 30 are unknown to Petitioners who therefore sue said Real Parties in Interest

25 by such fictitious names and will seek leave to amend this Petition for Writ of Mandamus

26 when their identities have been ascertained.

27 14. Petitioners are informed and believe that at all times herein alleged, Real Parties

28 in Interest and each of them were the agents and employees of each of the remaining Real

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
4

1 Parties in Interest and while doing the things herein alleged, were acting within the course and

2 scope of such agency and employment.

3

4 TI

5 STANDING

6 15. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 14 as if fully

7 set forth herein.

8 16. Approval of the Project will adversely affect the interests of Petitioner Pedro

9 Point Community Coalition. Petitioner Pedro Point Community Coalition has a strong interest

10 in the preservation of the environment. Members of Petitioner Pedro Point Community

11 Coalition reside in the City of Pacifica and the County of San Mateo, and include residents

12 affected by the Project and whose interests will be adversely affected by the violations of

13 CEQA, the Subdivision Map Act and the City Code. Approval of the Project and adoption of

14 an exemption from CEQA, the Subdivision Map Act and the City Code will adversely affect

15 these interests of Pedro Point Community Coalition and its members. Petitioner Pedro Point

16 Community Coalition was formed subsequent to Project approval. Its members have expressed

17 their concerns and commented on the Project during the administrative proceedings wherein

18 the Project was considered. Therefore, Petitioner Pedro Point Community Coalition has

19 exhausted its administrative remedies and has standing pursuant to Public Resources Code
20 Section 21177(c). Accordingly, Petitioner Pedro Point Community Coalition is an "aggrieved

21 person" within the meaning of Public Resources Code ยง 21177. The claims asserted and relief

22 requested are broad-based, so that participation in the litigation by individual members is not

23 required.

24 17. Approval of the Project will adversely affect the interests of Petitioner Allison

25 West. Petitioner Allison West is a resident and taxpayer of the City of Pacifica and the County

26 of San Mateo who is dedicated to preserving the environment of the City of Pacifica and the

27 County of San Mateo as set forth, supra, and is concerned about maintaining the environmental
28 integrity of the City of Pacifica and the County of San Mateo. Approval of the Project and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
5

adoption of an exemption from environmental review will adversely affect these interests of

2 Petitioner Allison West. Petitioner Allison West has submitted comments on and objections to

3 the lack of CEQA compliance and has participated at public hearings. Accordingly, Petitioner

4 Allison West is an "aggrieved person" within the meaning of Public Resources Code Section

21177.

18. Jurisdiction of this Court is invoked pursuant to California Code of Civil

7 Procedure ยงยง 1085 and 1094.5; California Public Resources Code ยง 21167; CEQA Guidelines
ยง 15112; the Constitution of the State of California; the Constitution of the United States; and

9 other applicable laws and regulations.

10 IV

11 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

12 19. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 18 as if fully

13 set forth herein.

14 20. Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition

15 by themselves or others, raising each and every issue known to them before Respondents, in

16 compliance with Public Resources Code ยง 21177, Code of Civil Procedure ยงยง 1085 and

17 1094.5, and other applicable laws.

18 21. Notice of the filing of this action as required by Public Resources Code cop

19 21167.5 was mailed to Respondent on July 28, 2020. (Letter and Proof of Service are attached
20 hereto as Exhibit "A.")

21 V

22 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

23 Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act
[Public Resources Code ยง 21000 et seq.]
24 22. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 21 as if fully
25 set forth herein.
26 23. Respondents' determination that the Project is categorically exempt from CEQA
27 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion because Respondents failed to a act in a manner
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
6

required by law when they determined the Project to be exempt from environmental review

2 under the Class 3, "New Construction or Conversion of Small Structures" CEQA categorical

3 exemption. The Project also includes the development of a mixed-use development located at

4 1300 Danmann which includes the development of six additional residential units and

5 commercial development. The interpretation of the exemption presents a question of law for

6 the Court's independent review. Moreover, Respondents' factual determinations are not

7 supported by substantial evidence.

8 24. CEQA prohibits piecemeal environmental review because when an agency does

9 so, it underestimates the environmental impacts of the overall action since each segment is

10 analyzed in a vacuum without consideration of the other parts of the project that will also be

11 approved. Precedent has long established that the environmental impacts of a project cannot be
12 "submerged by chopping a large project into many little ones, each with a potential impact on

13 the environment, which cumulatively may have disastrous consequences." See, Burbank-
14 Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority v. Hensler (1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 577, 592; Bozung v.

15 Local Agency Formation Comm'n (1975) 13 Cal.3d 263, 274, 283-284; Orinda Ass'n v Board

16 of Supervisors (1986) 182 Cal.App.3d 1145, 1171.

17 25. A project is defined broadly in order to maximize environmental protection.

18 City of Santee V. County of San Diego (1989) 214 Cal.App.3d 1438, 1452; McQueen v. Board

19 of Directors of the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 1136,
20 1143 (disapproved on other grounds). A project must be defined and accurately described to

21 ensure an "intelligent evaluation of the potential environmental effects of a proposed activity."

22 Burbank Glendale Pasadena Airport Auth. v. Hensler, supra, 233 Cal.App.3d at 592 (citing

23 McQueen V. Bd. of Directors, supra, 202 Cal.App.3d at 1143 44). "A narrow view of a project

24 could result in the fallacy of division, that is, overlooking its cumulative impact by separately
25 focusing on isolated parts of the whole." Id.

26 26. The applicant is also developing property at 1300 Danmann Ave for commercial
27 and residential development, which is contiguous with and has been merged with the parcel for
28 the project. The parcel for the proposed Project (277 Kent Parcel") is a sub-standard lot that

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
7

was merged with the 1300 Danmann Parcel in 1985. Since the 277 Kent Parcel and the 1300

2 Danmann Parcel are one lot merged voluntarily in 1985, the project is one project for purposes

3 of CEQA. Moreover, the 277 Kent and 1300 Danmann Parcels are threatened with coastal

4 erosion and development will cause irreparable harm to the coastal environment.

6 VI

7 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

8 Violation of the Subdivision Map Act and the City Code [Government Code ยง 66410 et seq.; City Code ยง 10-1.1201(a)] 9

10
27.
11 Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference Paragraphs 1 through 26 as if fully
set forth herein.
12
28.
13 The Project is part of a larger project ay 1300 Danmann that is separately on

14 appeal to the City Council. The applicant is also proposing to develop the 1300 Danmann

15 Parcel, which as stated supra, is contiguous with and has been merged with the parcel for the

16 project. The 277 Kent Parcel is a sub-standard lot that was merged with the 1300 Danmann
Parcel in 1985 through recorded notices of merger. The City and the applicant cannot undo 17

18 what was already done by recordation. The City has essentially approved development on a

19 substandard lot without approval pursuant to the Subdivision Map Act for the creation of this
new substandard lot.
20
29.
21 Assuming for the sake of argument that the lots were not previously merged, the

22 277 Kent Parcel and the 1300 Danmann Parcel are required to be merged. City Code section

23 10-1.1201(a) states:

24 At least one of the affected parcels is undeveloped by any structure for which a building permit was issued, or for which a building permit was not required at the time
25 of construction, or is developed only with an accessory structure or accessory structures, or is developed with a single structure, other than an accessory structure,
26 which is also partially sited on a contiguous parcel or unit.

27 The City is not only ignoring the notices of merger but did not correctly apply the City Code to
28 require merger. The 1300 Danmann Parcel is undeveloped, except for perhaps a small

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
8

1 accessory structure which requires merger pursuant to the City Code. Nevertheless, the parcels
2 have already been merged voluntarily by the owner.

3 30. The Respondents' failure to recognize the merger of the parcels was a failure to

4 proceed in a manner required by law.

5

6 VII

7 ATTORNEYS' FEES

8 31. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 30 as if fully

9 set forth herein.

10 32. In pursuing this action, Petitioners will confer a substantial benefit on the

11 People of the State of California and therefore are entitled to recover from Respondents and

12 Real Parties in Interest reasonable attorneys' fees and costs pursuant to California Code of

13 Civil Procedure ยง 1021.5 and other provisions of the law.

14

15 VIII

16 INJUNCTION

17 33. Petitioners hereby incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 32 as if fully

18 set forth herein.

19 34. An actual controversy has arisen concerning Respondents' failure to comply

20 with CEQA (Pub. Resources Code ยง 21000 et seq.), as set forth above.

21 35. As a result of the above-alleged violations of CEQA, Respondents have failed to

22 conduct adequate environmental review as required by law, and have violated the Subdivision

23 Map Act and the City Code and, thus, have failed to proceed in a manner required by law in

24 approving the Project.

25 36. At all times mentioned herein, Respondents have been able to comply with

26 CEQA, the Subdivision Map Act and the City Code, and prepare adequate environmental

27 review, and comply with all relevant provisions of law. Notwithstanding such an ability,

28 Respondents have failed and continue to fail to perform their duty to comply with CEQA, the

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
9

Subdivision Map Act, the City Code, and all other relevant provisions of law.

2 37. Petitioners are informed and believe, and on that basis allege, that Respondents

3 are threatening to proceed with development of the Project in the near future. Said

4 implementation of the Project will irreparably harm the environment and will result in

5 significant and unmitigated adverse environmental impacts.

6 38. Petitioners possess no speedy, adequate remedy at law, in that implementation

7 and development in connection with the Project will permanently and forever harm, injure,

8 degrade, and impact the environmental values of the City of Pacifica, the County of San Mateo

9 and the State of California. Petitioners will suffer irreparable and permanent injuries if

10 Respondents' actions described herein are not set aside.

11 39. A stay and/or restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunction

12 should issue restraining Respondents from proceeding with development of the Project.

13 40. In order to preserve the status quo, a stay and/or restraining order and

14 preliminary and permanent injunction should issue staying Respondents' approval of the

15 Project and determination of exemption from environmental review.

16

17 PRAYER

18 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment as follows:

19 1. For Alternative and Peremptory Writs of Mandate ordering Respondents to set

20 aside the Project, including but not limited to City Council Resolution No. 41-2020 and any

21 and all Project approvals;

22 2. For an order staying Respondents or other Project applicants from engaging in

23 any activity pursuant to the Project until Respondents perform environmental review and the

24 Project complies with California statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the
25 requirements of CEQA, the Subdivision Map Act and the City Code;

26 3. For reasonable attorneys' fees, pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure

27 1021.5, and other provisions of the law;

28 4. For costs of suit; and

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS

The Honorable Dierdre Martin and City Council

Pacifica, CA 94044

Re: Notice of Intent to Commence Litigation
Dear Mayor Martin and Members of the Council:
Pursuant to the requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21167.5, this letter will
serve as notice that the Pedro Point Community Coalition and Allison West will commence
litigation against City of Pacifica and the City Council of the City of Pacifica ("Respondents")
by filing a Petition for Writ of Mandamus.
This litigation challenges the actions of Respondents. Petitioner challenges the approval
of an application of San Pedro Valley, LLC on property owned by the Frances E. Christen Trust
for demolition of an existing single-family residence, detached garage, and barn, and
construction of a 1,753 square-foot, two-story single-family residence, a 236 square-foot a
detached garage, and a 216 square-foot carport on a 3,516 square foot-lot at 277 Kent Road
(Resolution No. 41-2020). This litigation has been commenced, inter alia, because the actions
listed in the preceding paragraph do not comply with the requirements of the California
Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code ยง 21000 et seq.) because the approval of the
Project is part of a much larger development on Pedro Point. The petition also alleges violations
of the Subdivision Map Act and the City Code.

Very truly yours,
