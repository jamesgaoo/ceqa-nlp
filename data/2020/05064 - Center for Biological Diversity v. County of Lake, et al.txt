INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the July 21, 2020 decision of Lake County and its Board of
3 Supervisors ("Respondents") to approve the Guenoc Valley Mixed Use Planned Development
4 Project ("Project") and certify an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the Project (State
5 Clearinghouse Number 2019049134). The Project includes a general plan amendment, a new
6 zoning district, a zoning reclassification, subdivision map, and various other associated

7 approvals.

8 2. The Project, proposed by Lotusland Investment Holdings, Inc. ("Real Party in

9 Interest"), would encompass a total of approximately 16,000 acres in the southeastern portion of
10 the County, about 2 miles southeast of Middletown and 15 miles north of Calistoga. The Project
11 site is mostly undeveloped open space and ranch land, with some existing vineyards. It contains
12 thousands of acres of valuable and sensitive oak woodland and savannah and habitat that
13 supports numerous special-status plant and wildlife species, such as Golden eagle, Western pond
14 turtle, and Yellow-legged frog.

15 3. The Project has been billed in promotional materials as "one of the world's
16 preeminent luxury resort communities" and "a perfect fit for the present moment, when high net
17 worth individuals are seeking to move out of urban areas to more natural, healthy, and pristine
18 environments." It proposes a luxury resort with retail and commercial uses and low density
19 residential "estates." It will also include recreational facilities such as a golf course, spa and
20 wellness center, and polo club. In total, the Project would permit the development of up to 850
21  hotel and resort residential units and 1,400 residential estates. The Project also includes an off-
22 site housing complex for its workers in Middletown.
23 4. Members of the public including the Center for Biological Diversity (the
24 "Center") and other environmental organizations raised concerns throughout the administrative
25 process that the Project will have significant negative environmental impacts on, among other
26 things, biological resources (including special status species), wildfire, community safety,
27 greenhouse gas emissions, water quality, water supply, traffic, and land use. Yet, Respondents
F 28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

failed to disclose or adequately analyze these impacts, failed to identify and adopt feasible
2 mitigation measures to reduce them, and failed to consider reasonable alternatives to the Project.
3 THE PARTIES

4 5. Petitioner CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY is a non-profit
5 conservation organization dedicated to the protection of native species and their habitats through
6 science, policy, and environmental law. The Center has approximately 81,000 members
7 worldwide, including members who reside within communities in the vicinity of the Project.
8 The Center has worked for many years to protect imperiled plants and wildlife, open space, air
9 and water quality, and the overall quality of life for people in unincorporated Lake County
10 where the Project is proposed. Members of the Center will be directly and adversely affected by
11 the approval and construction of the Project.
12 6. Respondent COUNTY OF LAKE (the "County"), a political subdivision of the
13 State of California, is responsible for regulating and controlling land use in the unincorporated
14| territory of the County, including implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA.
15 The County is the "lead agency" for the Project for the purposes of Public Resources Code
16 Section 21067, with principal responsibility for conducting environmental review of the Project.
17 The County has a duty to comply with CEQA and other state laws.
18 7. Respondent BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF THE COUNTY OF LAKE (the
19 "Board") is the duly elected decision-making body of the County. As the decision-making body,
20 the Board is responsible for granting the various approvals necessary for the Project and for
21 ensuring that the County has conducted an adequate and proper review of the Project's
22 environmental impacts under CEQA.
23 8. On information and belief, Real Party in Interest LOTUSLAND INVESTMENT
24 HOLDINGS, INC. ("Real Party in Interest"), is a corporation registered to do business in the
25 State of California, is the owner of the real property that is the subject of the approvals
26 challenged in this action, is the Project applicant for purposes of CEQA, and is the recipient of
27 the approvals challenged in this action.
28 2

RELIEF

9. Petitioner does not know the true names and capacities, whether individual,

2 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of respondents DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, and therefore 1
3 sues said respondents under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition to show their
4 true names and capacities when the same have been ascertained. Each of the respondents is the

5 agent and/or employee of Respondents, and each performed acts on which this action is based

6 within the course and scope of such respondent's agency and/or employment.

10. Petitioner does not know the true names and capacities, whether individual,
corporate, associate, or otherwise, of real parties in interest DOES 21 through 40, inclusive, and
9 therefore sues said real parties in interest under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this
10 Petition to show their true names and capacities when the same have been ascertained.

11 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

12 11. This Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set aside Respondents'
13 decision to approve the Project under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 (or
14 alternatively, section 1085) and Public Resources Code section 21168.5 (or alternatively, section
15 21168) and section 21168.9.

16 12. Venue for this action properly lies in the Lake County Superior Court because
17 Respondents and the proposed site of the Project are located in the County, Many of the
18 significant environmental impacts from the Project that are the subject of this lawsuit would
19 occur in the County, and the Project would affect the interests of County residents, including
20 members of the Center.

21 13. Respondents have taken final agency actions with respect to approving the Project
22 and certifying the EIR. Respondents had a duty to comply with applicable state laws, including
23 but not limited to CEQA and the State Planning and Zoning Law, prior to undertaking the
24 discretionary approvals at issue in this lawsuit.

25 14. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
26 21167.5 by serving a written notice of Petitioner's intention to commence this action on

27

28 3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

1 Respondents on August 19, 2020. A copy of the written notice and proof of service is attached
2 hereto as Exhibit A.

3 15. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
4 21167.6 by concurrently notifying Respondents of Petitioner's request to prepare the record of
5 administrative proceedings relating to this action. A copy of the Petitioner's Election to Prepare
6 Administrative Record of Proceedings is attached hereto as Exhibit B.
7 16. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant
8 action and has exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the extent required by law,
9 including, but not limited to, timely submitting extensive comments objecting to the approval of
10 the Project and identifying in writing to Respondents the deficiencies in Respondents'
11 environmental review for the Project on April 21, 2020, July 6, 2020, and July 20, 2020, and
12 orally during the County of Lake Planning Commission's hearing on June 18, 2020 and the
13 Board's hearings on July 7 and July 21, 2020.
14 17. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section
15 21167 and CEQA Guidelines section 15112.
16 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

17 The Proposed Project and Proiect Site
18 18. The Project is located on approximately 16,000 acres in unincorporated
19 southeastern Lake County. The Project site is largely undeveloped, consisting predominately of
20 agricultural land and open space. The site contains thousands of acres of oak woodlands, which
21 provide valuable habitat and connectivity for a wide variety of species. Blue oak woodland is the
22 most predominant habitat type on the Project site.
23 19. The site also includes a large network of ponds and reservoirs connected by major
24 tributaries as well as perennial and intermittent streams. There are almost 200 acres of riparian
25 stream habitat, as well as over 400 acres of emergent wetlands, over 650 acres of ponds and
26 reservoirs, over 122 acres of jurisdictional wetlands, and over 10 acres of jurisdictional open
27 waters in the Project area. The Project site provides wildlife movement corridors and contains
28 4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

habitat for numerous protected and special status wildlife species such as the Golden eagle,
2 Western pond turtle, and foothill yellow-legged frog, all of which have been observed on the
3 site. At least nine separate special status plant species have also been observed and recorded

4 onsite.

5 20. The Project is a phased master planned mixed-use resort and residential
6 community intended to provide high-end luxury accommodations and services. The Project
includes a resort, consisting of hotels, retail and commercial uses; low density residential

8 housing; and recreation amenities such as a golf course, spa and wellness center, and equestrian

9 facilities and polo club. The Project approvals include a General Plan and Zoning Ordinance
10 Amendment that would introduce a new zoning district and rezone the entire Project site to
11 permit the development of up to a total of 850 hotel and resort residential units and 1,400
12 residential estates. The Project also includes an off-site housing complex for its workers, located
13 on a 12.75-acre site in central Middletown, and an off-site water supply well and pipeline
14 located adjacent to Butts Canyon Road. The Project will eventually add over 4,000 new
15 residents-approximately 6% of Lake County's 2017 population---to the Project site and off-site
16 location.

17 21. The Project site is extremely susceptible to wildfire. The majority of the Project
18 site is located in an area designated by the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection
19 as a "Very High" or "High" Severity Fire Hazard Zone. Environmental review documents for
20 the Project indicate that a majority of the Project site has been burned by wildfire since the
21 1950s, with at least 12 separate wildfires burning a portion of the Project site. More recent fires,
22 including the Butts Fire in 2014 and the Jerusalem and Valley Fires in 2015, were large-scale
23 fires that affected large portions of the site. In particular, the Valley Fire caused wide-spread
24 damage to the southern portion of the site, particularly along Butts Canyon Road. These affects

25 are still visible and present today.

26 22. The Project will generate greenhouse gas emissions from the removal of carbon-

27 sequestering forest land, Project construction, and new vehicle traffic, in addition to other

28 5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE

- sources. The EIR acknowledges that even with the proposed mitigation measures, the Project
2 will emit over 30,000 metric tons of CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions each
3 acknowledges that this impact will be significant. year and

4 23. The EIR acknowledges that the Project will also have significant and unavoidable
5 impacts to aesthetics, land use and agriculture, noise, and transportation.
6 The Project Approvals and EIR
24. On or about April 23, 2019, the County issued a Notice of Preparation ("NOP")

9 for the Project, in which it notified public agencies and interested individuals that, as a lead
agency, it would be preparing a Draft EIR to analyze the proposed Project's potentially
10 significant environmental impacts.
11 25.

12 On or about February 21, 2020, Respondents published a Notice of Availability of

13 a Draft EIR for the Project and circulated the Draft EIR for public review and comment.
26. Petitioner and numerous others, including public agencies, organizations, and
14 individual members of the public, submitted comments on the Draft EIR. Commenters pointed
15 out serious deficiencies in the Draft EIR. For example, commenters explained that the Project
16 would have significant impacts on biological resources (including special status species),
17 greenhouse gas emissions, water supplies, water quality, wildfire risk and public safety, traffic,
18 and land use, and that the EIR's analysis and proposed mitigation of those impacts was woefully
19 inadequate.

20 27. On April 21, 2020, before the close of the comment period on the Draft EIR,
21 Petitioner submitted written comments on the Draft EIR to the County. The comments
22 explained, among other things, that the Draft EIR failed to comply with CEQA in the following
23 respects:

24 a.

25 The Draft EIR's Project Description failed to describe the whole of the proposed

26 action and failed to accurately describe the nature and extent of the project

27 approvals being considered as a part of the Project;

28 6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

b. The Draft EIR's analysis of and mitigation for impacts to biological resources was

2 inadequate because, inter alia, it failed to disclose, evaluate, avoid and/or mitigate

3 significant impacts to biological resources including special status species,
4 sensitive habitat, including oak woodlands and aquatic resources, and wildlife
5 movement;

6 C. The Draft EIR's analysis of and mitigation for the Project's greenhouse gas

7 impacts was inadequate because, inter alia, the Draft EIR failed to provide
adequate information regarding the Project's emissions and purported reductions

9 from mitigation, the proposed mitigation measures were improperly deferred and
10 unenforceable, and the Draft EIR failed to consider all feasible mitigation;

11 d. The Draft EIR's analysis of and mitigation for the Project's impacts to water

12 quality and hydrology were inadequate because, inter alia, the Draft EIR provided

13 inadequate stream setbacks and buffers;
14 c. The Draft EIR's analysis of and mitigation for the Project's wildfire-related
15 impacts were inadequate because, inter alia, the Draft EIR failed to disclose the

16 increased risk of wildfire resulting from the Project, failed to disclose the full

17 extent of the Project's wildfire-related impacts, failed to adequately mitigate the

18 Project's wildfire-related impacts, and failed to consider the Project's impact on

19 the ability of residents and those in the vicinity of the Project site to evacuate

20 safely in the event of a wildfire; and

21 f. The Draft EIR failed to disclose, analyze or mitigate the Project's cumulative

22 impacts.

23 28. On or about June 12, 2020, the County released a Final EIR for the Project, which
24 included text changes to the Draft EIR and Respondents' responses to public comments on the
25 Draft EIR. Many of the defects identified in the Draft EIR identified by Petitioner and other
26 commenters persisted in the Final EIR.

27

RELIEF

- 29. On June 18, 2020, the Planning Commission held a hearing to consider the
2 Project. Petitioner submitted comments and testimony at the hearing requesting that the County
3 postpone the Board's approval of the project in order to permit the public and interested parties

4 the time they needed to adequately and intelligently review the Final EIR and thousands of
5 additional pages of accompanying documentation. After multiple commissioners admitted that
6 they had not yet fully reviewed the voluminous Final EIR, the Planning Commission voted to
7 continue the hearing for 7 days, 7 to June 25, 2020.

30. On June 25, 2020, the Planning Commission held a hearing at which it continued
9 its consideration of the Project. At that meeting, the Planning Commission voted to recommend
10 approval of the Project and certification of the EIR, and the item was calendared for hearing
11 before the Board on July 7, 2020.

12 31. On June 30, 2020, Petitioner submitted a letter to the County expressing alarm at
13 the speed with which the County was hurrying to approve the Project and repeating its request
14 that the County postpone the Board's hearing to approve the Project to allow the public and
15 interested parties the necessary time to adequately and intelligently review the Final EIR and
16 accompanying documentation. The County provided no response to this letter.
17 32. In a letter submitted to the County on July 6, 2020, before the hearing to consider
18 the Project and certify the Final EIR, Petitioner described deficiencies remaining in the Final
19 EIR, commenting that the Final EIR failed to comply with CEQA in the following respects:
20 a.

21 The EIR's analysis of and mitigation for impacts to biological resources remained

22 inadequate because, inter alia, it failed to adequately disclose, evaluate, avoid

23 and/or mitigate significant impacts to biological resources including special status

24 species, sensitive habitat including oak woodlands and aquatic resources, and
wildlife movement;

25

26 b. The EIR's analysis of and mitigation for the Project's greenhouse gas impacts

27 remained inadequate because, inter alia, the EIR failed to provide adequate

28 information regarding the Project's emissions and purported reductions from
8

mitigation, the proposed mitigation measures were improperly deferred and
2 unenforceable, and the EIR failed to consider all feasible mitigation; and

3 C. The EIR's analysis of and mitigation for the Project's impacts to water quality and
hydrology remained inadequate;
d. The EIR's analysis of and mitigation for the Project's impacts to water supply

6 remained inadequate;

7 e. The EIR's analysis of and mitigation for the Project's wildfire-related impacts

8 remained inadequate because, inter alia, the EIR failed to disclose the increased
risk of wildfire resulting from the Project, failed to disclose the full extent of the

10 Project's wildfire-related impacts, failed to adequately mitigate the Project's
11 wildfire-related impacts, failed to disclose existing wildfire and safety conditions

12 on the Project site, and failed to consider the Project's impact on the ability of

13 residents and those in the vicinity of the Project site to evacuate safely in the event

14 of a wildfire; and

15 f. The EIR failed to disclose, analyze or mitigate the Project's cumulative impacts.
16 Petitioner requested that the County revise the EIR to correct the deficiencies and recirculate the
17 revised EIR for public review and comment.

18 33. On July 6, 2020, the California Attorney General submitted a letter to the County
19 commenting on the Final EIR for the Project. The Attorney General stated that after reviewing
20 the environmental review documents for the Project, including the Final EIR, it concluded that
21 the EIR's discussion and analysis of the Project's wildfire impacts was inadequate and failed to
22 comply with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. Specifically, the Attorney General's letter stated
23 that the Final EIR was deficient in the following ways:

24 a. The Final EIR failed to analyze the increased risk of wildfire ignition and spread

25 that would result from the Project;

26

27

28 9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

-

2 b. The Final EIR failed to adequately analyze the Project's alternatives, and in

3 particular the County's findings failed to justify the rejection of the EIR's
Alternative C;

4 C.

5 The Final EIR failed to adequately analyze or disclose the Project's impacts on

6 community health and safety in the event of a wildfire, including the Project's
impacts on the ability of residents to evacuate; and

7

8 d. The Project failed to comply with applicable regulations governing dead end
roads.

9 The Attorney General's letter also noted that the County's timeline for preparation of the Final
10 EIR and scheduling of hearings to approve the Project represented "an unusually rapid pace to
11 consider an EIR, particularly one for a Project of this scale and significance."
12 34. On July 7, 2020, the Board held its public hearing to consider the Project, and at
13 the Project applicant's request, continued the hearing for two weeks.
14 35. On July 20, 2020, Petitioner submitted a letter with additional comments on the
15 Final EIR and the County's supplemental environmental review documents. Petitioner objected
16 to the County's last-minute addition of new materials and substantive changes to the Project and
17 environmental review for the Project and requested that the Board deny or postpone approval
18 and continue the hearing and direct the EIR to be revised and recirculated for public review and
19 comment prior to approval of the Project. The comments identified numerous deficiencies in the
20 environmental review for the Project, including the following:
21

22 a. The environmental review for the Project failed to properly analyze and mitigate

23 the Project's greenhouse gas-related impacts, and the last-minute changes to the

24 mitigation-including a brand-new carbon offset purchase program-did not cure
these deficiencies;
25

26 b. The environmental review for the Project failed to properly analyze and mitigate

27 the Project's wildfire-related impacts, and the last-minute addition of new Project

28 materials did not cure these deficiencies; and
10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

C. The environmental review for the Project failed to properly analyze and mitigate

2 the Project's greenhouse gas-related impacts, and the last-minute addition of new

3 Project materials did not cure these deficiencies.

4 36. On July 20, 2020, the California Attorney General submitted a second letter to the
5 County with further comments on the Final EIR for the Project and the supplemental documents
6 that the County and Project Applicant had recently posted to the County's website. The letter
7 requested that "that the Board of Supervisors refrain from certifying the FEIR and approving the

8 Project until we have the opportunity to review the supplemental FEIR documentation"
9 including an "Errata" to the Final EIR; new Responses to Comments; an updated Mitigation
10 Monitoring and Reporting Program; updated CEQA Findings of Fact and Statement of
11 Overriding Considerations; new Project maps and materials; and a response letter with exhibits
12 from the applicant's attorney. The letter noted that the Attorney General and the public had only

13 one day to review much of the additional analysis, assess its adequacy, and be informed about
14 the Project's wildfire impacts. The letter further explained that the environmental review for the
15 Project remained inadequate for the following reasons:

16 a. The environmental review for the Project failed to provide a Project-specific
17 analysis of increased wildfire risks resulting from the Project;

18 b. The environmental review for the Project failed to analyze whether Alternative C
19 would have reduced wildfire risks compared to the Project;

20 c. The environmental review for the Project failed to address evacuation, including

21 capacity on internal and external roadways, in the event of wildfire; and
22 The Project continued to fail to comply with applicable dead-end road
23 requirements; and

24 d. The environmental review for the Project did not address deficiencies in

25 mitigation for the Project's wildfire-related impacts.
26 The Attorney General requested that the County "refrain from certifying the FEIR and
27 approving the Project until the FEIR is further revised and sufficient time is provided for our
28 11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

office and members of the public to review and understand the wildfire risks associated with the
2 Project."

37. Other non-profit conservation organizations, including the California Native Plant
4 Society and the California Wildlife Foundation, submitted written comments to the County prior
5 to the Board's final hearing on the Project identifying additional deficiencies in the
environmental review for the Project and requesting that the Board deny approval of the Project.
Respondents' Approval of the Project and Certification of the EIR

38. On July 21, 2020, the Board of Supervisors held a public hearing to consider
9 whether to certify the Final EIR and approve the Project. Petitioner and members of the public
10 attended the public hearing and gave testimony opposing the certification of the Final EIR and
11 approval of the Project.
12 39. At the conclusion of the July 21, 2020 hearing, the Board of Supervisors adopted
13 the Planning Commission's recommendation, certified the Final EIR, approved the Project and
14 adopted findings in support of the Project approval and EIR certification, and voted to adopt a
15 General Plan amendment as well as other Project-related entitlements. During the hearing,
16 Supervisor Rob Brown observed, "This is the largest land use decision this board will ever
17 make."

18 40. On or about July 21, 2020, the County filed a Notice of Determination for the
19 Project with the County Clerk, which stated that the County had approved the Project, prepared
20 an EIR, and adopted Findings and a Statement of Overriding Considerations. The County filed
21 the Notice of Determination even though the Project approvals had not yet undergone a second
22 reading as required by California law.
23 41. The Notice of Determination listed Lotusland Investment Holdings, Inc. as the
24 sole project applicant.
25 42. As a result of Respondents' actions in approving the Project, certifying the EIR for
26 the Project, and adopting Findings and a Statement of Overriding Considerations, Petitioner and
27 its members will suffer significant and irreparable harm. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or
28 12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

adequate remedy at law for this irreparable harm. Unless this Court grants the requested writ of
2 mandate to require Respondents to set aside certification of the EIR and approval of the Project,
3 Respondents' approval will remain in effect in violation of state law..
43. Respondents have prejudicially abused their discretion and failed to proceed in the

5 manner required by law in the following ways:

6 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

7 Violation of CEQA - Inadequate EIR (Public Resources Code ยง 21000, et seq.,

8 CEQA Guidelines 14 Cal. Code Regs. ยง 15000 et seq.)

9 44. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference cach and every allegation set forth
10 above.

11 45. CEQA was enacted by the legislature to ensure that the long-term protection of the
12 environment is a guiding criterion in public decisions. CEQA requires the lead agency for a
13 project with the potential to cause significant environmental impacts to prepare an EIR for the
14 project that complies with the requirements of the statute, including, but not limited to, the
15 requirement to disclose and analyze the project's potentially significant environmental impacts.
16 The EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such that the decisionmakers can
17 intelligently and fully consider environmental consequences when acting on the proposed
18 project. Such analysis must include and rely upon thresholds of significance that are based on
19 substantial evidence in the record.

20 46. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency analyze and adopt feasible and

21 enforceable mitigation measures that would reduce or avoid any of a project's significant
22 environmental impacts. If any of the project's significant impacts cannot be mitigated to a less
23 than significant level, then CEQA bars the lead agency from approving a project if a feasible
24 alternative is available that would meet the project's objectives while avoiding or reducing its
25 significant environmental impacts.

26

27

28 13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

47. CEQA requires that substantial evidence in the administrative record support all of
2 the agency's findings and conclusions, including those contained in the EIR, and that the agency
3 explain how the evidence in the record supports the conclusions the agency has reached.

4 48. Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a
manner required by law because the Project relies on an EIR that fails to meet the CEQA's
6 requirements for the disclosure, analysis, mitigation, reduction, and/or avoidance of significant
7 environmental impacts from the Project, including direct and cumulative impacts relating to

8 wildfire, greenhouse gas emissions, traffic, biological resources, water supplies, water quality,

9 and land use.

10 49. Project Description. The Draft EIR's Project Description failed to describe the
11 whole of the proposed action and failed to accurately describe the nature and extent of the
12 project approvals being considered as a part of the Project.
13 50. Biological Resources. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or
14 mitigate the Project's significant direct and cumulative impacts to biological resources,
15 including numerous special status wildlife and plant species affected by the Project. Those

20 leaved daisy, Two-carpellate western flax, Lake County western flax, Colusa layia, Keck's
21 checkerbloom, Green jewelflower, and Three Peaks jewelflower. The EIR's biological resources
22 analysis is inadequate because, inter alia, the EIR:
23 a. fails to include and fully analyze all biological resources impacts resulting from
24 the Project;
25 b. relies on mitigation measures that are vague, ineffective, deferred, and/or
26 unenforceable;

27 C. fails to incorporate all feasible mitigation or avoidance measures;

1 d. fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's significant

2 impacts on habitats and features such as oak woodlands and riparian areas; and

3 e. fails to adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the direct, indirect, and

4 cumulative impacts of the Project on other biological resources, including

5 cumulative impacts to wildlife movement.

6 51. Greenhouse Gas Emissions. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or
7 mitigate the Project's significant direct, indirect, and cumulative greenhouse gas impacts. The

8 EIR's analysis of greenhouse gas impacts is inadequate because, inter alia, the EIR:

9 a. fails to include and fully analyze all greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the
10 Project;

11 b. fails to support its selection of thresholds of significance with substantial evidence
12 in the record;

13 C. relies on greenhouse gas mitigation measures that are vague, ineffective, deferred,
14 and/or unenforceable;

15 d. fails to incorporate all feasible mitigation and avoidance measures; and

16 e. impermissibly relies on off-site offsets to mitigate Project's greenhouse gas
17 emissions because the EIR fails to provide substantial evidence that such offsets

18 are real, permanent, quantifiable, verifiable, and enforceable reductions.

19 52. Transportation. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the
20 Project's significant direct, indirect, and cumulative traffic impacts. The EIR's analysis of traffic

21 impacts is inadequate because, inter alia, the EIR:

22 a. fails to include and fully analyze all traffic impacts resulting from the Project;

23 b. relies on traffic mitigation measures that are vague, deferred, and unenforceable;
24 C. improperly relies on outdated "level of service" metrics when evaluating traffic

25 impacts; and

26 d. fails to incorporate all feasible mitigation and traffic reduction measures.

53. Water Supply. The EIR does not adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the
2 environmental consequences of supplying water and adequate utilities service to the Project. The
EIR's utilities and water supply analysis is inadequate because, inter alia, the EIR:

a. fails to include and adequately analyze the impacts of providing the Project with
long-term potable water supply;
b. fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's impacts on

groundwater;

C. relies on mitigation measures that are vague, ineffective, deferred, and/or
9 unenforceable, and fails to adequately assess the impacts associated with those
10 mitigation measures; and
11 d. fails to incorporate all feasible mitigation measures to reduce the impacts of
12 supplying the Project with potable water and long-term utilities service.
13 54. Hydrology and Water Quality. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze,
14 and/or mitigate the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts the Project will have on hydrology
15 and water quality. The EIR's analysis is inadequate because, inter alia, it fails to adopt feasible
16 mitigation measures to reduce the environmental impacts from development on the Project site.
17 55. Land Use. The EIR fails to adequately analyze or fully disclose or mitigate
18 | inconsistencies with all applicable land use policies, and guidance, including, but not limited to:
19 a, The County of Lake General Plan;
20 b. The County of Lake Zoning Ordinance;
21 C. The Guenoc Water Rights Modification Project Mitigation Plans; and
22 d. Applicable requirements for dead end roads.
23 56. Aesthetics. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the
24| direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts the Project will have on aesthetics and fails to adopt all
25 feasible mitigation measures to reduce or avoid the Project's aesthetic impacts.
26 57. Alternatives. The EIR fails to provide an adequate selection and discussion of
27 alternatives for consideration that foster informed decision-making and informed public
28 16
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

1 participation. The alternatives analysis in the EIR does not meet CEQA's requirement that an

2 EIR consider a reasonable range of alternatives that lessen the Project's significant

3 environmental impacts, does not focus on alternatives that either eliminate adverse impacts or
4 reduce them to insignificance even if they would to some degree impede the Project's
5 objectives, failed to consider a feasible alternative that would lessen significant impacts,

6 unlawfully rejects alternatives without adequately analyzing whether their impacts would be less

7 with substantial evidence its conclusions significant that the Project's, and fails to support
8 regarding alternatives.

0 58. Response to Comments. The responses to comments in the Final EIR fail to meet
10 CEQA's requirements in that they neither adequately dispose of all the issues raised, nor provide
11 specific rationale for rejecting suggested Project changes, including the consideration or
12 adoption of feasible mitigation measures or alternatives. CEQA requires that a lead agency
13 evaluate and respond to all environmental comments on the Draft EIR that it receives during the
14 public review period. The responses must describe the disposition of the issues raised and must
15 specifically explain reasons for rejecting suggestions and for proceeding without incorporating
16 the suggestions. The Final EIR's responses to comments fail to satisfy the requirements of law.
17 59. Based upon each of the foregoing reasons, the EIR is legally defective under
18 CEQA. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in violation of CEQA in approving the
19 || Project. As such, the Court should issue a writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside the
20  certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

21 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

22 Violation of CEQA - Failure to Recirculate Environmental Impact Report (Public

23 Resources Code ยง 21000, et seq., CEQA Guidelines ยง 15000 et seq.)

24 60. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth
25 above.

26

27

28 17
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

61. CEQA requires that if significant new information is added to an EIR after a draft
2 EIR is prepared, but before certification of the final EIR, an amended EIR must be recirculated
3 for public review and comment.
62. After the close of the public comment period for the Draft EIR and after the

5 publication of the Final EIR, the County added significant new information, including a so-
6 called "Errata" with extensive new analysis, to the EIR prior to certifying it and approving the
7  Project.

63. Despite the changes and addition of new materials, Respondents failed to
9 recirculate the EIR or any portion of the EIR as required CEQA, nor did Respondents update the

10 text of the Final EIR to reflect the proposed changes or new analysis. As a result of
11 Respondents' failure to recirculate the EIR, the public and public agencies were deprived of any
12 meaningful opportunity to review and comment on the approved Project, its substantial adverse
13 environmental consequences, and the new information regarding other unanalyzed
14 environmental effects of the Project.

15 64. By failing to amend and recirculate the EIR, Respondents failed to proceed in the
16 manner required by law, and their decision to approve the Project was not supported by
17 substantial evidence.

18 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

19 Violation of CEQA - Inadequate Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations

20 (Public Resources Code ยง 21000, et seq., CEQA Guidelines ยง 15000 et seq.)
21 65. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth
22 above.

23 66. Respondents' Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations violate
24 the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. Respondents' findings fail to identify the
25 changes or alterations that are required to avoid or substantially lessen the project's significant
26 environmental effects, and do not provide adequate reasoning or disclose the analytic route from
27 facts to conclusions, as required by law. The purported benefits of the Project cited in the

28 18
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

Statement of Overriding Considerations do not outweigh the Project's substantial costs to public
2 health and the environment. Respondents' Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
3 are not supported by substantial evidence in the record.

4 67. When an EIR concludes that project would result in significant environmental
5 effects, but where mitigation measures and alternatives identified in the EIR are deemed
6 infeasible, the CEQA findings must identify the specific economic, legal, social and
7 technological and other considerations that make infeasible the adoption of mitigation measures
or alternatives. All CEQA findings must be supported by substantial evidence in the record and
9 must disclose the analytical route by which approval of a project is justified. Here, the findings
10 regarding the impacts, mitigation measures, and alternatives relied upon by Respondents'
11 approval of the Project are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, and do not
12 disclose the links between evidence and conclusions.

13 68. Respondents' Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations fail to
14 reflect the independent judgment of Respondents.
15 69. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents failed to proceed in a manner
16 required by law, and their decision to approve the Project and adopt Findings of Fact and a
17 Statement of Overriding Considerations was not supported by substantial evidence.
18 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
19 Violation of State Planning and Zoning Law
20 (Government Code ยง 65300, et ยง seq.)
21 70. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth
22 above.

23 71. The California State Planning and Zoning Law requires the legislative body of
24 each county to adopt a general plan for the physical development of the county. The County's
25 General Plan is a fundamental land use planning document and serves as the "constitution" for
26 future development within the County. Land use decisions, including the approvals associated
27 with the Project, must be consistent with the General Plan.

28 19
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

72. The Project is inconsistent with mandatory County of Lake General Plan policies,
2  including, but not limited to, Open Space and Conservation Policy 1.13 requiring the County to
3 support the conservation and management of oak woodland.

4 73. By approving a project inconsistent with the County's General Plan, Respondents
5 prejudicially abused their discretion and violated provisions of the State Planning and Zoning
6 Law, requiring invalidation of the County's approvals.
7 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for relief as follows:

8 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

9 1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to vacate
10 and set aside certification of the EIR, adoption of the Findings and Statement of Overriding
11 Considerations, and approval of all associated Project permits, entitlements, and approvals;
12 2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to comply
13 with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines and take any other action as required by Public
14 Resources Code section 21168.9;

15 3. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent
16  injunctions restraining Respondents or Real Party, and their agents, servants, and employees,
17 and all others acting in concert with them or on their behalf, from taking any action to
18 implement, fund or construct any portion or aspect of the Project, pending full compliance with
19 the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines;
20 4. For a declaration that Respondents' actions in certifying the EIR and approving
21 the Project violated CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, and that the certification and approvals
22 are invalid and of no force or effect, and that the Project is inconsistent with other applicable
23 plans, policies, or regulations;

24 5. For costs of the suit;

25 6. For attorney's fees as authorized by Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and
26 other provisions of law; and,

27 7. For such other and future relief as the Court deems just and proper.

Re: Notice of Commencement of Legal Action Alleging Environmental Harm

Dear Mr. Becerra:

The enclosed Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate, Center for Biological Diversity v. County of Lake et al., Case #CV421152 (Lake County Superior Court), is submitted to your office pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 388 and Public Resources Code section
21167.7. This case is being pursued under the private attorney general provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

The case is being brought by the Center for Biological Diversity challenging Lake County's approval of the Guenoc Valley Mixed Use Planned Development Project (the "Project"). The 16,000 acre Project site is mostly undeveloped open space and ranch land, with
some existing vineyards. It contains valuable and sensitive oak woodland and savannah and habitat that supports numerous special-status plant and wildlife species, such as Golden eagle, Western pond turtle, and Yellow-legged frog. The Project also poses serious wildfire risks.
The Center for Biological Diversity alleges environmental harm from the Project that could affect the public generally and the natural resources of the state.
Please acknowledge receipt in the enclosed prepaid, self-addressed envelope. Thank you for your attention to this matter.
