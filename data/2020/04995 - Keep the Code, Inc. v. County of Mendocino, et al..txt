VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRTT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Petitioner and Plaintiff KEEP THE CODE, INC. (Petitioner) alleges as follows:

2 INTRODUCTION AND STATEMENT OF FACTS

3 1. Through this Petition for Writ of Mandate, Petitioner seeks to compel
4 Respondents/Defendants COUNTY OF MENDOCINO (County) and COUNTY OF MENDOCINO
5 BOARD OF SUPERVISORS (Board or Respondents) to acknowledge, to properly analyze, and to fully
6 mitigate the significant adverse environmental impacts associated with the Board's December 16, 2019
7 approvals of: (1) amendments to the Mendocino County Zoning Ordinance creating a new Mineral
8 Processing Combining District ("MPCD") to allow for asphalt and concrete batch plants on Rangeland
9 within one-half mile of surface mining activities that have vested rights or a permit to mine from the
10 County; (2) a concurrent rezone adding the combining district to an 18-acre portion of the Harris Quarry

11 project site to accommodate a proposed asphalt facility; (3) a Use Permit Renewal/Modification (UR 19-
12 83/2005) for 30 years to allow expansion of the Harris Quarry, extraction of up to 200,000 in-place

13 cubic yards of material per year, production of up to 150,000 tons of asphalt per year, and nighttime
14 operations up to 100 nights per year; and (4) an associated revised Reclamation Plan for the quarry site
15 (collectively, the "Harris Quarry Use Permit and Reclamation Plan" or "Project"). Specifically,
16 Petitioner asserts that the County violated: (i) the California Environmental Quality Act (Pub. Resources
17 Code, § 21000 et seq.) (CEQA) and the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14, California Code of Regulations,
18 §15000 et seq. (CEQA Guidelines) by approving the Project without preparing a revised environmental
19 impact report ("EIR") that complied with this Court's 2013 judgment/writ of mandate and by failing to
20| investigate and analyze significant new information relating to the Project's significant environmental
21 impacts, alternatives, and mitigation that did not exist at the time of the County's 2012 approvals; (ii)
22 State Planning and Zoning Law (Government Code sections 65000, et seq.) by approving the Project
23 based on a General Plan that fails to comply with the State law requirements relating to fire hazards and
24 emergency evacuation; and (iii) the Mendocino County Code by improperly exercising original
25 jurisdiction over approvals related to the Project's actions.

26 2. This action follows a successful court challenge to the County's initial 2012 approvals of

27 the Project. In that action, the Mendocino County Superior Court found the County's findings regarding
28| two alternatives were not supported by the record and not in compliance with CEQA. The first District

2
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 Court of Appeals upheld this Court's judgment and writ of mandate directing the County to vacate all of
its 2012 Project approvals, including its certification of the 2012 Final EIR ("FEIR"). Since then, the
County has cobbled together various documents provided by Real Parties in a transparent effort to
4 rehabilitate its 2012 decisions - which were found legally deficient - without addressing any changed of
the circumstances that have occurred since the County's original approvals over seven years ago, as

6 required by CEQA.

3. Critically, at a time in which Californians are bearing witness to an increasing risk of
catastrophic fire dangers at an alarming and accelerating rate, the Board, by a narrow 3-2 vote, refused
to evaluate or propose mitigation measures to address significant new information relating to the
10 Iproposed Project's potential impacts on fire hazards and emergency evacuation.
11 4. Keep the Code submitted comments on the 2019 revised draft EIR ("RDEIR") explaining
12 that CEQA required the County to recirculate the RDEIR to address significant new information relating

13 to increased fire risks in the Project area, and the Project's significant adverse impacts on fire hazards
14 and emergency evacuation. Keep the Code's comments explained that the California Department of
15 Public Health released the "Climate Change and Health Profile Report" for Mendocino County in
16 February 2017. The report indicates that climate change has substantially increased fire hazard risks in
17 Mendocino County since 2012 and will continue to do so through 2085. As the California Department of
18 Forestry and Fire Protection states on its home webpage: "fire season in California and across the West
19 lis starting earlier and ending later each year. Climate change is considered a key driver of this trend.
20 Warmer spring and summer temperatures, reduced snowpack, and earlier spring snowmelt create longer
21 and more intense dry seasons that increase moisture stress on vegetation and make forests more
22 susceptible to severe wildfire. The length of fire season is estimated to have increased by 75 days across
23 the Sierras and seems to correspond with an increase in the extent of forest fires across the state." In
24 2017, the Redwood Fire burned a total of 36,523 acres and 543 structures in Mendocino County,
25 || including lands less than one mile from the Project. In 2018, Mendocino County experienced the
26 devastating Mendocino Complex Fire. Six of the top ten most destructive fires in California State history
27 have occurred in just the past two years. Recognizing the need for urgent action, Governor Gavin
28 Newsom proclaimed a "State of Emergency" on March 22, 2019, and directed the Department of

3
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Forestry and Fire Protection ("CALFIRE") to immediately implement high priority fuel reduction
2 projects (including in Mendocino County) to protect the lives, health, property, and natural resources of
3 the State of California. Pursuant to the corresponding Executive Order (N-05-19), CALFIRE published
4 Community Wildfire Prevention and Mitigation Report, which identified thirty-five emergency fuel
5 reduction projects, including the Willits Emergency Fuels Reduction Project in Mendocino County. The
6 2019 Revised Final EIR ("RFEIR") ignored all of this significant new information regarding the
7| increased fire risks in the Project area. Instead, the RFEIR simply concluded that this foregoing
8 information was insignificant, and thus, the 2012 FEIR's discussion of, and mitigation for, fire hazards
and emergency evacuation remained valid and did not need to be updated.

10 5. Concerned with the County's failure to provide any meaningful response to its comments
11 on increased fire risks and emergency evacuation, Keep the Code provided additional comments on the
12 2019 RFEIR from fire protection experts. The comments explained that the Project greatly increases the
13 overall fire risk in the proposed Project area, and that the 2012 FEIR's proposed mitigation does
14 essentially nothing to reduce the Project's increased fire risks or adverse impacts on emergency
15 evacuation. The comments explained that the 2019 RFEIR failed to address the increased risk of
161 wildland fires in the Project area, extreme fire behavior potential in Northern California (most notably
17 ember showering), increase in external fire ignition risk from traffic and outdoor facility operations as
18 compared to no-project conditions, and failed to provide an evaluation of fire/life safety for existing
19 structures and vulnerable populations that neighbor the proposed development. These experts also
20 explained that due to the perched location of the Project, even weak to moderate winds could generate
21 embers capable of reaching and igniting nearby vegetation and structures. These potentially devastating
22 impacts could be exacerbated by the seasonal, and historically strong, Diablo winds that affect the
23 region. They explained that the 2012 FEIR's mitigation inadequately addressed the Project's
24 contribution to increased fire risks and that "an ignition on or nearby to the Northern Aggregates
25 property under drought and high-wind conditions would effectively make these mitigation efforts
26 useless and prove to be insufficient to protect downwind structures under a plausible emergency
27 scenario in high-risk fire months." The Board did not address these comments in its findings approving
28| the Project.

4
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

6. Even worse, Keep the Code explained that the County failed to comply with Senate Bill

2 1241 (passed in 2012 after the original Project approvals), which mandates the County to update the

3 Safety Element of its General Plan to address the risk of fire in state responsibility areas and very high

4 fire hazard severity zones. Because the County's General Plan fails to include this mandatory discussion,
approval of the Project and Mineral Processing Combining District (*MPCD") Ordinance would also
6 render it incompliant with SB 1241 (codified under Government Code § 65302).

7. This action continues the Petitioner's ongoing efforts to ensure that Respondents'
8 approvals of the proposed Projectincluding the associated amendments to the Mendocino County
9 Zoning Ordinance creating a new MPCD overlayfully evaluate and consider the Project's significant
10 adverse environmental impacts, feasible alternatives, and mitigation, particularly in light of the
11 significant new information and circumstances that have transpired since the County's original 2012
12 approvals, as required by CEQA.

13 8. This case also centers on the County's disregard for the public's right to review and
14 participate in the decision-making process that CEQA guarantees. CEQA mandates public
15 accountability by requiring the County to a engage as a partner with the public through evaluating shared
16 expertise, disclosing agency analyses, checking for accuracy, detecting omissions, discovering public
17 concerns, and soliciting counter proposals. Not only did the County fail to independently evaluate
18 changed circumstances as required by CEQA, it misinformed the public by stating that it would not
19 respond to comments other than those related to the Court's ruling. Further, the Board improperly
20 eliminated review by the Planning Commission by asserting original jurisdiction over the Project's
21 approvals in an attempt to shorten the Project's public review period. This decision curtailed the
22| opportunities for the public to review and comment on the purported 2019 RFEIR's new analyses. Not
23 only do these purportedly new analyses fail to comply with CEQA's substantive requirements, this type
24 of disordered and misinformed process of environmental review is simply not allowed under CEQA.

25 9. Accordingly, Petitioner hereby seeks a writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside
26 approval of Project until further environmental review and analysis, as required by CEQA, is conducted.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

PARTIES

10. Petitioner, Keep the Code, Inc., is a California non-profit corporation whose members
include persons and entities that objected to the approval of the Project on the grounds raised in this
Petition, prior to the Project's approval. Keep the Code, Inc. is the successor to the unincorporated
association Keep the Code, which was formed in 2005. Keep the Code's mission is to preserve and
6 protect the natural environment, agriculture, and rural character of Mendocino County for the general
7 public. Petitioner's members are united by their concern about the Project's potentially significant,
8 adverse environmental impacts, and the County's failure to properly investigate, disclose, analyze, and
9 mitigate such impacts, prior to certifying the EIR and approving the Project, as mandated by the
10 procedural and substantive requirements set forth in CEQA, the State Planning and Zoning Law, and the
11 Mendocino County Code. Petitioner was duly authorized to, and does bring this action in a
12 representative capacity on behalf of its members.

13 11. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Petitioners and Plaintiffs
14 fictitiously named herein as Does through 10, inclusive. Petitioner is informed and believes, and
15 thereon allege, that such fictitiously named Petitioners and Plaintiffs are beneficially interested in the
16 County's compliance with its mandatory duties under CEQA before approving the Project, and that such
17 Petitioners and Plaintiffs adequately participated in the County's administrative review process for the
18 Project to have standing to be joined as Petitioners and Plaintiffs in this proceeding. Petitioner will
19 amend this Petition, with leave of the court if necessary, to allege the fictitiously named Petitioners' and
20 | Plaintiffs' true names and capacities when ascertained.

21 12. Respondent, County of Mendocino, is and at all times herein mentioned was, a political
22 subdivision of the State of California, duly organized and existing by virtue of the Constitution and the
23 laws of the State of California. The County is, and at all relevant times was, responsible for
24 administering and carrying out its laws and applicable federal and State laws. The County is the "lead
25 agency" for the purposes of Public Resources Code section 21067, with principal responsibility for
26 conducting environmental review of the Project. The County has duty comply with CEQA, the
27 Planning and Zoning Law, and its own County Code.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

13. Respondent, Board of Supervisors of the County of Mendocino, is and at all times herein
2 mentioned was, the duly elected decision-making body of Respondent County. As the decision-making
body for the Project, the Board of Supervisors of the County of Mendocino was charged with

4 responsibilities under CEQA for certifying the 2019 RFEIR for the Project and granting the various
approvals necessary for the Project.

14. Petitioner is unaware of the true names and capacities of Respondents fictitiously named
DOES 11 through 100, and sues such respondents by fictitious names. Petitioner is informed and

8 believes, and on the basis of such information and belief, alleges the fictitiously named respondents are
9 also responsible for the actions described in this Petition. When the true identities and capacities of these
10 respondents have been determined, Petitioner will amend this petition, with leave of the court if
11 necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.

12 15. Hereinafter, Respondents County of Mendocino, Board of Supervisors of the County of
13 Mendocino, and DOES 11 through 100, inclusive, are referred to as "Respondents."

14 16. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that Real Party in Interest
15 NORTHERN AGGREGATES, INC. ("NAI") is a California corporation, and at all times herein
16 mentioned had an interest in real property located within the Project site and is the applicant and
17 recipient of the challenged Project approvals and, therefore, is an entity whose interests will be affected
18 by this action against Respondents.

19 17. Petitioner is unaware of the true capacities of Real Parties in Interest DOES 101 through
20 200, and sues such real parties in interest by fictitious names. Petitioner is informed and believes, and
21 based on such information and belief, alleges that the fictitiously named real parties in interest are
22 directly and materially affected by the actions described in this Petition. When the true identities and
23 capacities of these real parties in interest have been determined, Petitioner will amend this Petition, with
24 leave of the court if necessary, to insert such identities and capacities.

25 18. Hereinafter, Real Party in Interest NAI, and DOES 101 through 200, inclusive, are
26 referred to as "Real Parties."

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

2 19. The Mendocino County Superior Court has initial jurisdiction of the matters alleged

3 herein pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure sections 526, 527, 1085, 1087, and 1094.5, and Public

4 Resources Code sections 21168 and 21168.5.

20. Venue for this action properly lies in the Superior Court for the State of California in and
6 for the County of Mendocino pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394. The main offices of
Respondents are located in Mendocino County. The Project relates to amendments of the Mendocino
County Zoning Ordinance. Further, this action is brought against the County of Mendocino.

STANDING

10 21. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition. Petitioner is beneficially
11 interested in this matter. (Cal. Code Civ. Proc., § 1086.) Petitioner has a direct interest in ensuring that
12 Respondents fulfill their duties to comply with CEQA. Petitioner has an interest in preserving and
13 protecting, for the general public, the natural environment, agriculture, and rural character of Mendocino
14 County. Furthermore, Petitioner actively participated in the administrative process leading up to
15 Respondents' decision to adopt and certify the 2019 RFEIR and approve the Project.

16 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

17 22. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant action and
18 has exhausted any and all available administrative remedies to the extent possible and required by law.
19 Petitioner submitted numerous objections to approval of the Project during the administrative process.
20| (Pub. Resources Code, § 21177, subd. (a).)

21 23. Respondents have taken final agency actions with respect to adopting and certifying the
22 2019 RFEIR and approving the Project. Respondents have a mandatory duty to comply with applicable
23 state and federal laws, including, but not limited to CEQA, prior to undertaking the discretionary
24 approvals at issue in this lawsuit. Petitioner possesses no effective remedy to challenge the approvals at
25 issue in this action other than by means of this lawsuit.

26 24. If any grounds for noncompliance with CEQA or other applicable laws alleged in this
27 Petition were, for some reason, not raised prior to the close of the public hearing on the Project before
28 the County issued its NOD, it was because there was no meaningful opportunity for members of the

8
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 public to raise those objections in writing prior to the approval of the Project, or because the County

2 failed to give notice required by law.

3 25. Keep the Code has exhausted its administrative remedies.

4 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

5 26. On December 16, 2019, Respondents approved the Project. The County issued a notice of
6 determination ("NOD") for the Project on December 17. 2019.

27. CEQA requires that an action challenging Respondents' decision to certify the RFEIR be
8 filed no later than 30 days after the posting of the NOD for the Project. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21167,
9 subd. (c).)

10 28. This Petition was filed in Mendocino County Superior Court prior to the 30th day
11 following the posting of the NOD issued by Respondents.

12 29. The statute of limitations for a State Planning and Zoning Law challenge to the
13 Respondents' decision to adopt or amend a zoning ordinance is 90 days after Respondents' decision
14 became final. (Gov. Code § 65009, subd. (c)(1)(B).

15 30. This Petition was filed in Mendocino County Superior Court prior to the 90th day
16 following Respondents' final decision.

17 31. Petitioner has filed this Petition prior to the expiration of any and all applicable statute of

18 limitations.

19 ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTIONS

20 32. Petitioner brings this action on the basis, among others, of Government Code section 800,

21 and other applicable laws, which awards petitioners attorneys' fees in actions to overturn decisions that

22 are arbitrary and capricious, such as the decisions in questions here.

23 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

24 33. Petitioner brings this action as a private attorney general pursuant to Code of Civil
25 Procedure section 1021.5, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights affecting the
26 public interest.

27

28

9
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

34. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer significant benefit on the
general public by requiring the Respondents to carry out their duties under CEQA and other applicable
laws before approving the Project.

35. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will result in the enforcement of important
5 rights affecting the public interest by compelling the Respondents to engage in a fair, objective, and
6 legally adequate analysis of the Project, and to ensure that the public has a meaningful opportunity to
review and comment on the impacts and mitigation measures for the Project.

36. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make an award of
9 attorneys' fees appropriate in this case. Absent enforcement by Petitioner, Respondents will proceed
10 with a project that will cause significant, unmitigated environmental impacts that might otherwise have
11 been reduced or avoided through legally adequate environmental review and the adoption of feasible
12 mitigation measures.

13 37. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.7, Petitioner will serve a copy of this
14 Petition on the Attorney General's office to give notice that Petitioner brought this lawsuit as private
15 attorneys general under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

16 IRREPRARABLE HARM

17 38. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law unless
18 this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their approval of the
19 Use Permit for the Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approvals will remain in
20 effect in violation of State law and Petitioner and residents and property owners of Mendocino County
21 will be irreparably harmed. No money damages or legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioner

22 and the residents and property owners of Mendocino County for that harm.

23 RELIEF REQUESTED

24 39. Petitioner seeks an alternative writ of mandamus, a peremptory writ of mandamus,
25 temporary and permanent injunctive relief, costs, and attorneys' fees.

26 A. Alternative and Peremptory Writs of Mandamus (Code Civ. Pro., §§ 1085, 1087;

27 Pub. Resources Code, 88 21168.5, 21168.9; Gov. Code, § 65860

28

10
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

40. Petitioner seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate pursuant to Code of Civil
2 Procedure section 1085, which provides that a writ of mandate "may be issued by any court to any
inferior tribunal, corporation, board, or person, to compel the performance of an act which the law
4 specially enjoins, as a duty resulting from an office, trust, or station," and Code of Civil Procedure
section 1087, which provides that "[t]he writ may be either alternative or peremptory."

41. Petitioner also seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate pursuant to Public
Resources Code sections 21168.5 and 21168.9. Section 21168.5, applicable in traditional mandamus
8 actions involving alleged violations of CEQA, provides as follows:

9 In any action or proceeding, other than an action or proceeding under [Public Resources Code]

10 section 21168, to attack, review, set aside, void or annul a determination, finding, or decision of
a public agency on the grounds of noncompliance with [CEQA], the inquiry shall extend only to
11 whether there has been a prejudicial abuse of discretion. Abuse of discretion is established if the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law or if the determination or decision is not
12 supported by substantial evidence.

13 42. Public Resources Code section 21168.9 authorizes a court, after determining that a
14 respondent agency has violated CEQA, to issue a peremptory writ of mandate requiring the agency to
15 void or suspend decisions where the agency failed to comply with CEQA, or to take other steps

16 necessary to bring its decision into compliance with CEQA. Petitioner requests that, pursuant to
17 subdivision (a)(1) of section 21168.9, the Court issue a peremptory writ requiring Respondents to void
18 their actions adopting the RFEIR and findings, and approving the Project.
19 43. Section 21168.9, subdivision (b), provides that "[t]he trial court shall retain jurisdiction
20 over the public agency's proceedings by way of a return to the peremptory writ until the court has
21 determined that the public agency has complied with [CEQA]." Petitioner also seeks alternative and
22 peremptory writs of mandate on the grounds that Respondents adopted zoning amendments that are
23 inconsistent and in violation of the State Planning and Zoning Law, Government Code section 65860.
24 Government Code section 65860 states that a county's zoning ordinances must be consistent with that
25 county's general plan.
26 44. Petitioner seeks alternative and peremptory writs of mandate requiring Respondents to
27 void the Board's approval of Use Permit and Reclamation Plan Renewal #UR 19-83/2005 until adequate
28 environmental review as required by CEQA is performed.

11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

45. Petitioner has incurred costs and reasonable attorney's fees in the course of bringing this
2 action and will seek compensation thereof if Petitioner prevails.

3 B. Temporary and Permanent Injunctive Relief (Code Civ. Pro., §§ 526, 527; Civ.

4 Code, § 3422)
46. Petitioner requests injunctive relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 526,
which provides, in pertinent part, that:
6 (a) An injunction may be granted in the following cases:
(1) When it appears by the complaint that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief demanded,

1 and the relief, or any part thereof, consists in restraining the commission or continuance
of the act complained of, either for a limited period or perpetually.

10 (2) When it appears by the complaint or affidavits that the commission or continuance of some act during the litigation would produce waste, or great or irreparable injury, to a
11 party to the action.

12 (3) When it appears, during the litigation, that a party to the action is doing, or threatens,
13 or is about to do, or is procuring or suffering to be done, some act in violation of the rights of another party to the action respecting the subject of the action, and tending to
14 render the judgment ineffectual.

15 (4) When pecuniary compensation would not afford adequate relief.

16 (5) Where it would be extremely difficult to ascertain the amount of compensation which

17 would afford adequate relief.

18 (6) Where the restraint is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of judicial proceedings.

19 (Code Civ. Proc., § 526, subd. (a).)

20 47. Petitioner requests temporary injunctive relief pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure

21 section 527, which provides that the court may issue a temporary restraining order or a preliminary

22 injunction if the plaintiff (or petitioner) meets specified criteria.

48.
23 Petitioner requests an administrative stay pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section

24 1094.5, subdivision (g), which provides that the court "may stay the operation of the administrative

25 order or decision pending the judgment of the court," if the court concludes that such a stay is not

26 "against the public interest."

27 49. Petitioner requests permanent injunctive relief pursuant to Civil Code section 3422,

28 which provides that the court may issue a permanent injunction if the plaintiff meets specified criteria.

4 prohibiting respondent county and applicant from altering project site pending full compliance with
CEQA].)

50. Respondents' actions will result in irreparable harm to Mendocino County, those who
6 reside, work, or own property in Mendocino County, and the public at large because the Project, as

7 approved, will cause significant environmental impacts that will not be mitigated to less than significant
8 levels.

51. Mendocino County, those who reside, work or own property in Mendocino County, and
10| the public at large, have also been harmed by Respondents' failure to provide environmental documents

11 that accurately and fully inform interested persons of the Project's true impacts. Such documents would
12 lead to better environmental decisionmaking regarding the Project, and would enable all residents of the
13 affected region to better understand the true environmental and economic values of the decision makers
14 of the County of Mendocino.

15 52. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law. No
16 money damages or other legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioner for the harms described
17 in the preceding paragraphs.

18

19 53. C. Attorneys' Fees and Costs (Code Civ. Pro., §§ 1021.5, 1032; Gov. Code, § 800)

20 This litigation involves the enforcement of an important right affecting the public

21 interest. Accordingly, if Petitioner is successful in prosecuting this action, Petitioner will confer a

22 substantial benefit on the citizens of the region and state, and therefore will be entitled to an award of
reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to section 1021.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

23 54.

24 Petitioner also brings this action pursuant to Government Code section 800, which

25 awards petitioners up to $7,500.00 in attorneys' fees in actions to overturn agency decisions, such as
those at issue herein, that are arbitrary and capricious.

26 55.

27 Additionally, Petitioner requests reimbursement for costs pursuant to Code of Civil
Procedure section 1032, subdivision (b), which provides that "[e]xcept as otherwise expressly provided
28 by statute, a prevailing party is entitled as a matter of right to recover costs in any action or proceeding.

NOTICE OF CEQA SUIT

56. On January 14, 2020, Petitioner e-mailed and mailed to Respondents a letter stating that
Keep the Code planned to file a Petition for Writ of Mandate seeking to invalidate Respondents'
4 approval for the Harris Quarry Expansion Project, Use Permit and Reclamation Plan Renewal
(Resolution Nos. 19-402 and 19-403), and its adoption of Ordinance Nos. 4450, 4451, 4452, 4453, and

6 4454.

57. Through this letter, Petitioner complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.5.
Attached hereto as Exhibit A is the true and correct copy of this letter.

9 58. Petitioner will furnish the Attorney General of the State of California with a copy of the
10 Petition and Complaint, in compliance with Public Resources Code section 21167.7 and Code of Civil

11 Procedure section 388.

12 ELECTION TO PREPARE RECORD

13 59. Pursuant to Public Resources Code, section 21167.6, subdivision (b)(2), Petitioner elects
14 I to prepare the record of proceedings in this action. Concurrently with this Petition, Petitioner is filing a
15 notice of its election to prepare the administrative record.
16 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

17 60. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their
18 entirety.

19 A. Project Background and Original Approvals

20 61. In 2006, Real Parties proposed to expand the operations at the existing Harris Quarry and

21 construct and operate new asphalt and concrete processing facilities. Real Parties also proposed adding a

22 Mineral Processing Combining District to the Mendocino County Zoning Ordinance to permit aggregate
23 processing facilities on quarry properties on lands zoned Rangeland. A notice of preparation ("NOP")

24 for this proposed project was posted by the State Clearinghouse on November 14, 2006.

25 62. In 2007, a draft EIR for the proposed Harris Quarry Expansion Project was circulated.
26 Before preparation of a final EIR was complete, applicant Real Parties redesigned the project. A revised

27 NOP was issued on August 4, 2010. A revised draft EIR for the Project was published in May of 2011.

28

14
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

63. During the environmental review process on the County's original approvals, Petitioner
submitted numerous comment letters describing their concerns regarding the potential significant
impacts attributable to the Project. These letters included comments regarding the potential impacts of
the proposed asphalt plant and Use Permit at the Harris Quarry site and the potential impacts of the
proposed MPCD Ordinance specifically. Commenters, including Petitioner, implored the County to
6 conduct program-level analysis of the MPCD Ordinance.

64. The 2012 DEIR states that "[a]mending the Mendocino County Zoning Code to create a
Mineral Processing Combining District (MPCD)" was the first primary project element. The second
9 element of the Project would then overlay this new MPCD on a portion of the applicant's property.
10 Finally, the Project would involve a use permit renewal/modification to allow increased extraction and
11 processing of aggregate, production of asphalt, and nighttime operations up to a 100 nights per year at
12 the Harris Quarry site.

13 65. On April 10, 2012, the Board adopted Resolution #12-065. certifying the Final
14 Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) for the Harris Quarry Expansion Project, including its
15 | incorporated Water Supply Assessment, the Findings of Fact, Statement of Overriding Considerations
16 and Mitigation Monitoring and Reporting Program, the Draft EIR (State Clearinghouse No.
17 2006112087), comments and responses to comments on the Draft EIR, and an errata section listing
18 minor edits to the Draft EIR (collectively, the "original EIR").

19 66. On May 11, 2012, Keep the Code filed a Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint for
20 Injunctive and Declaratory Relief against the County and County Board of Supervisors challenging the
21 Board's adoption of Resolution #12-065. (Mendocino County Superior Court, Case No. SC UK CVPT
22 1260196.)

23 67. On May 17, 2012, after Petitioners had filed their original Petition for Writ of Mandate,
24 the Planning Commission approved the Use Permit to allow for (1) the extraction of up to 200,000 in-
25 place cubic yards (cy) of rock a. from a hillside quarry; (2) establishment of an asphalt processing facility
26 and production of up to 150,000 tons of asphalt from the process material; (3) nighttime operations that
27 could occur up to 100 nights per year; and (4) a revised Reclamation Plan for the site. Petitioner
28 appealed this approval to the Board of Supervisors.

15
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 68. On June 19, 2012, the Board denied the appeal of the May 17, 2012, decision of the

2 Planning Commission and approved the Use Permit and Reclamation Plan Renewal #UR 19-83/2005.

3 By denying the appeal, the Board also adopted the Planning Commission's CEQA Consistency

4 Findings, General Plan Consistency Findings, and Project Findings.

5 B. Prior Litigation

6 69. Following briefing and a trial on the merits, the Mendocino County Superior Court found
7 the County's 2012 findings regarding Project Alternatives 4 and 5 were not supported by substantial
8 evidence. (Keep the Code, Inc. v. County of Mendocino, Super. Ct., Mendocino County, Oct. 9, 2013,

9 No. SCUK-CVPT-12-60196.) On November 14, 2013, the Court entered its judgment and issued a writ

10 of mandate directing the County to set aside and vacate the certification of the original FEIR and Project
11 approvals. (Ibid. [Judgment Granting Petition for Writ of Mandate].) Keep the Code and the Real Party

12 in Interest NAI separately appealed the decision.

13 70. On December 19, 2013, the County filed its initial return to the writ, stating it did not

14 concede that recirculation of the EIR was required under CEQA, as required under the Court's

15 I judgment. Rather, the County stated that it would recirculate the pages of the EIR that discussed

16 Alternatives 4 and 5, hold a noticed public hearing, receive additional evidence, accept additional public

17 comments, and make new findings. The initial return indicated the County would take other actions that

18 it deemed necessary to comply the Court's Judgment Granting the Petition for Writ of Mandate. The

19 County did not vacate the Project approvals, as required by the Court's Judgment Granting the Petition

for Writ of Mandate. 20

21 71. On November 30, 2018, the First District Court of Appeal affirmed this Court's decision.

• 22| (Keep the Code, Inc. v. County of Mendocino (Nov. 30, 2018, No. A140857) [nonpub. opn.].) In
23 reaching its decision, the Court of Appeal stated: "there was no evidence that Alternative 5's proposed

24 reduction in nighttime operations from 100 nights to 20 nights would be economically infeasible."
25| (Opinion at p. 15.)

26 C. County Approvals following Issuance of Writ of Mandate

27 72. On May 21, 2019, nearly six years after the Superior Court's decision, Tina Wallis,

28 counsel for NAI, sent the Mendocino County Board of Supervisors a letter requesting the Board to

16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

exercise its original jurisdiction powers under section 2.54.010. Ms. Wallis alleged-without any
2 evidence- -that the Harris Quarry Project's subsequent approvals required the Board to exercise original
3 jurisdiction because "time was of the essence." Ms. Wallis claimed the Project would contribute to the

4 County's general welfare and economic well-being because the Quarry's aggregate materials were the
only significant source of aggregate that could meet CalTrans' needs, and that there was a state-wide

6 shortage of such high-quality resources. The Board of Supervisors approved the request on June 18,

7 2019.

73. On August 28, 2019, the County released the RDEIR to supplement information that was
previously disclosed in the 2012 FEIR, as required by the final judgement in Keep the Code, Inc. v.
10 County of Mendocino. The RDEIR limited its analysis and discussion to the feasibility of Project
11 Alternatives 4 and 5, and included an economic analysis prepared by Real Parties' consultant,
12 EnviroMINE, Inc. ("EnviroMINE"). The 2019 RDEIR stated that the forthcoming final EIR would
13 incorporate the 2012 FEIR's approvals because "the Court found that all other aspects of the 2012 Final
14 EIR were sufficient." (2019 RDEIR at p. 2-1.) The RDEIR further stated: "Given the limited scope of
15 the 2019 RDEIR, together with the directives contained in the Court's remand and the requirements of
16 CEQA Guidelines Section 15234(d), comments that are not related to the specific issues under review
17 (Alternatives 4 and 5) will not be responded to. (2019 RDEIR, p. 1-4, emphasis added.) This statement

18 was misleading and suggested that the public and public agencies may not comment on significant new
19 information that had developed in the more than seven years since the County originally certified the
20 2012 FEIR.

21 74. In addition, at the time the County circulated the 2019 RDEIR, the County had not
22 complied with this Court's judgement to vacate its 2012 Project approvals or to decertify the 2012 FEIR.
23 This lead to uncertainty and confusion regarding whether the County would actually do so.

24 75. In light of the uncertainty regarding the status of the original 2012 FEIR and project
25 approvals, Keep the Code explained in its comments that, under CEQA, any agency granting an
26 approval for a project must prepare a subsequent or supplemental EIR if, on the basis of substantial
27 evidence in the light of the whole record, one or more of the following occurs:

28

17
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

(1) Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major revisions of the

2 previous EIR or negative declaration due to the involvement of new significant environmental

3 effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant effects;
t (2) Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the project is
undertaken which will require major revisions of the previous EIR or Negative Declaration due
6 to the involvement of new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the

7 severity of previously identified significant effects; or

8 (3) New information of substantial importance, which was not known and could not have been
known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the previous EIR was certified as
10 complete or the Negative Declaration was adopted, shows any of the following:

11 (A) The project will have one or more significant effects not discussed in the previous

12 EIR or negative declaration;

13 (B) Significant effects previously examined will be substantially more severe than shown
14 in the previous EIR;
15 (C) Mitigation measures or alternatives previously found not to be feasible would in fact
16 be feasible, and would substantially reduce one or more significant effects of the project,
17 but the project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative; or

18 (D) Mitigation measures or alternatives which are considerably different from those

19 analyzed in the previous EIR would substantially reduce one or more significant effects
20 on the environment, but the project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or

21 alternative.

22 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15162, subd. (a); see Pub. Resources Code, § 21166, italics added.) If any of these
23 conditions occur, a subsequent or supplemental EIR must be prepared by "the public agency which
24 grants the next discretionary approval for the project, if any." (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15162, subd. (c),
25 15163.)

26 76. Keep the Code further explained that, had the County vacated its initial approval of the
27 2012 FEIR as required by the Mendocino County Superior Court and Court of Appeal, recirculation of
28 the 2019 RDEIR would be required in order to address this significant new information. (Laurel Heights

18
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Improvement Assn. V. Regents of University of California (2003) 6 Cal.4th 1112, 1129-1130

2 [recirculation and supplemental review adhere to the same analysis and are required when significant

3 new information substantially changes a project's environmental effects].) As the California Supreme
•4 Court has explained, "[r]ecirculation is not mandated under section 21092.1 when the new information

5 merely clarifies or amplifies the previously circulated draft EIR, but is required when it reveals, for
6 example, a new substantial impact or a substantially increased impact on the environment." (Vineyard

7 Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. V. City of Rancho Cordova (2007) 40 Cal.4th 412, 447.)

8 According to the CEQA Guidelines, "significant new information" requiring recirculation includes, for
example, a disclosure showing a "substantial increase in the severity of an environmental impact would
10 result unless mitigation measures are adopted that reduce the impact to a level of insignificance."
11 (Guidelines, § 15088.5, subd. (a)(2).).

12 77. Upon advice of counsel, Keep the Code did not heed the County's direction and
13 submitted comments on the 2019 RDEIR, including comments from several experts who explained how
14 the RDEIR failed to evaluate significant changes that have occurred over the last seven years since the
15 County certified the 2012 FEIR, as mandated by CEQA. The comments explained that changed
16 circumstances required the County to revise and recirculate the 2019 RDEIR before it could consider
17 approving the Project. Keep the Code's comments, and those of its experts, centered on:

18 (1) the RDEIR's analysis and modification to Alternatives 4 and 5 improperly ignored the

19 changed circumstances and significant new information, especially in light of completion of
20 the First Phase of Willits Bypass;

21 (2) the completion of the first phase of Willits Bypass and changes in the demand for asphalt

22 over the last seven year constituted significant new information that changed the VMT

23 analysis in the 2012 FEIR and required the County to revise and recirculate its analysis of

24 and mitigation for Air Quality, Traffic, and Greenhouse Gas/Climate Change impacts, as

25 well as its evaluation of alternatives;

26 (3) the completion of the Willits Bypass was significant new information demonstrating

27 additional alternatives are feasible;

28 (4) significant new information demonstrated alternative locations are feasible;

19
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

(5) the RDEIR's analysis of Alternatives 4 and 5 improperly ignored road improvements made

2 since the project was originally approved in 2012;

3 (6) the County did not include an independent peer-review of the economic analysis of
4 Alternatives 4 and 5 prepared by Real Party's consultant EnviroMINE in the RDEIR, or

5 perform such an analysis before circulating the RDEIR;

6 (7) the RDEIR failed to analyze significant new impacts related to increased fire risks near the

7 project site;

8 (8) the previous EIR's Toxic Health Risk. Assessment relating to air quality impacts was
outdated and needed to be updated; and

10 (9) the previous EIR's VMT assumptions and estimates were outdated and required a new

11 analysis consistent with CEQA requirements.
12 The comments explained that, given this new information, the County was required to prepare and
13 recirculate a Revised RDEIR (or supplemental EIR) that complies with CEQA (see Pub. Resources
14 Code, § 21166; CEQA Guidelines, § 15262, subd. (a) [requiring an agency to prepare a supplemental
15 EIR if new information of substantial importance shows the project will have more significant effects
16 not discussed in previous EIR].) In doing so, the County was required to recirculate the 2019 RDEIR to
17 the public with an explanation that it will consider public comments that address this new significant
18 information or any new other new information submitted by the public agencies or public. (South
19 County Citizens for Smart Growth v. County of Nevada (2013) 221 Cal.App.4th 316, 327-328.)

20 78. On December 4, 2019, the County released 2019 RFEIR. However, the 2019 RFEIR
21 rejected consideration of the new information provided by Keep the Code and other commenters, on the
22 basis of res judicata and lack of substantial importance.

23 79. Keep the Code submitted comments on the 2019 RFEIR, explaining that res judicata did
24 not excuse the Board's failure to address significant new information, because such information was not
25 available at the time the County approved the Project in 2012. The significant new information
26 demonstrated that the Project will have significant effects that were not considered or analyzed in the
27 2012 RFEIR, and that previously examined significant effects will be even more severe. Keep the
28 Code's comments also included comments from additional experts who explained that the RFEIR failed

20
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

comply with CEQA by not providing responses to comments or addressing significant new information,
as required by CEQA.

80. Keep the Code's comments explained, in detail, that there was significant new
information that renders the original EIR's description of Alternatives 4 and 5 outdated and meaningless
for a comparison of alternatives. Notably, the new information regarding both Alternatives transforms

6 their original intent, thereby significantly changing the entire EIR and the scope of its impact analyses.
The comments explained that the information rendered the original and 2019 RFEIR's range of
alternatives unreasonable and inconsistent with the requirements of CEQA. Foremost, the 2019 RDEIR

9 and RFEIR modified the language of Alternative 4, such that it is rendered obsolete and cannot be
10 considered a feasible alternative. Second, the 2019 RDEIR and RFEIR failed to consider how changed
11 conditions namely, road improvements - affect the relevancy and appropriateness of Alternative 5,
12 which calls for the construction of a partial interchange. Finally, both Alternatives were rejected on the
13 basis of findings presented in the 2019 EnviroMINE Economic Feasibility Report - a report that rests
14 upon substantially different factual information than that which was relied upon in the initial
15 2012RFEIR.

16 81. The comments also explained that the passage of Senate Bill 1241 (2012) mandated the
17 County to update the Safety Element of its General Plan to address the risk of fire in state responsibility
18 areas and very high fire hazard severity zones. Because the County's General Plan fails to include this
19 mandatory discussion, approval of the Project and MPCD Ordinance would also render it incompliant
20 with SB 1241 (codified under Government Code § 65302).

21 82. Ultimately, the County rescinded all of its approvals, as directed by the Court, on
22 December 16, 2019. On the same day the County reapproved the Project, claiming to have corrected the
23 errors that accompanied the County's initial 2012 approval of the Project. In a narrow 3-2 vote, and
24 without addressing any of Keep the Code's comments on the 2019 FEIR or suggested mitigation, the
25 Board adopted:

26 (1) Resolution No. 19-402, which certified the Revised Final Environmental Impact Report,
27 adopted the CEQA Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations, and adopted a

26 85. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their
27 entirety.

28

22
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

A. Significant New Information Required the County to Prepare a Supplemental
EIR or recirculate the 2019 RDEIR.
2 86. Under CEQA, when an EIR has been adopted for a project, the certifying agency must
prepare a subsequent or supplemental EIR if, on the basis of substantial evidence in the light of the
whole record, one or more of the following occurs:
(1) Substantial changes are proposed in the project which will require major
6 revisions of the previous EIR. or negative declaration due to the involvement of
7 new significant environmental effects or a substantial increase in the severity of
8 previously identified significant effects;
9 (2) Substantial changes occur with respect to the circumstances under which the
10 project is undertaken which will require major revisions of the previous EIR or
11 Negative Declaration due to the involvement of new significant environmental
12 effects or a substantial increase in the severity of previously identified significant
13 effects; or
14 (3) New information of substantial importance, which was not known and could
15 not have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the
16 previous EIR was certified as complete or the Negative Declaration was adopted,
17 shows any of the following:
18 (A) The project will have one or more significant effects not discussed in the
19 previous EIR or negative declaration;
20 (B) Significant effects previously examined will be substantially more severe than
21 shown in the previous EIR;
22 (C) Mitigation measures or alternatives previously found not to be feasible would
23 in fact be feasible, and would substantially reduce one or more significant effects
24 of the project, but the project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure
25 or alternative; or
26 (D) Mitigation measures or alternatives which are considerably different from
27 those analyzed in the previous EIR would substantially reduce one or more
28

23
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

significant effects on the environment, but the project proponents decline to adopt
the mitigation measure or alternative.
(CEQA Guidelines, § 15162, subd. (a); see Pub. Resources Code, § 21166, italics added.) If any of these
conditions occur, a subsequent or supplemental EIR must be prepared by "the public agency which
grants the next discretionary approval for the project, if any." (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15162, subd. (c),
6 15163.

87. Relatedly, recirculation of an EIR is required when:

8 significant new information is added to the EIR after public notice is given of

9 the availability of the draft EIR for public review…but before certification…New
10 information added to an EIR is not "significant" unless the EIR is changed in a

11 way that deprives the public of a meaningful opportunity to comment upon a

12 substantial adverse environmental effect of the project or a feasible way to

13 mitigate or avoid such an effect (including a feasible project alternative) that the
14 project's proponents have declined to implement.
15 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15088.5, subd. (a).) "Significant new information" includes:

16 (1) A new significant environmental impact would result from the project or from

17 a new mitigation measure proposed to be implemented.

18 (2) A substantial increase in the severity of an environmental impact would result

19 unless mitigation measures are adopted that reduce the impact to a level of a
20 insignificance.

21 (3) A feasible project alternative or mitigation measure considerably different

22 from others previously analyzed would clearly lessen the significant

23 environmental impacts of the project, but the project's proponents decline to
24 adopt it.

25 (4) The draft EIR was so fundamentally and basically inadequate and conclusory

26 in nature that meaningful public review and comment were precluded.
27 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15088.5, subd. (a), emphasis added; Pub. Resources Code § 21092.1.) A decision
28 to not recirculate must be supported by substantial evidence in the administrative record. (CEQA

24
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

- Guidelines, § 15088.5, subd. (e).) "Recirculation is not mandated under section 21092.1 when the new
2 || information merely clarifies or amplifies the previously circulated draft EIR, but is required when it

3

4 reveals, for example, a new substantial impact or a substantially increased impact on the environment."

5 (Vineyard Area Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. v. City of Rancho Cordova, supra, 40 Cal.4th at p.
447.)

6 88.

7 including: The record contains substantial evidence that several of these conditions have occurred,

8 (a) The construction of the Willits Bypass is significant new information that renders Alternative
4 unactionable;

10

11 (b) The construction of the lane improvements by NAI and the completion of the Willits Bypass

12 are significant new information that requires modifications to Alternative 5 to comply with
CEQA; and

13

14 (c) The 2019 RFEIR conclusions and Board's findings regarding the Project's significant and

15 unavoidable air quality impacts from NOx emissions and potential feasible mitigation must

16 be revised because the passage of seven years has rendered the 2012 FEIR's analysis

17 outdated and the County's rationale for rejecting mitigation for the Project's significant and
unavoidable NOx impacts unsupported by the record;

18 89. The record also contains significant new information showing that the Project's impacts
19 will be substantially more severe than previously analyzed in the original FEIR. As Keep the Code and
20| its experts explained in their comments, this information includes information that was not available
21 when the County certified the original FEIR in 2012, including:

22

23 (a) is Construction of the Willits Bypass is significant new information that substantially changes

24 the 2012 RFEIR's VMT analysis and consideration of alternatives;

25 (b) New information on increased fire risks and changes to emergency evacuation since

26 County's 2012 approvals demonstrate the 2019 RFEIR and the Board's findings regarding

27 the Project and the new MPCD Ordinance's impacts on increased fire risk and evacuation are
not supported by substantial evidence; and

28

25
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

(c) The 2019 FEIR and Board's findings regarding the Project's health impacts caused by the
Project from diesel emissions and other sources of toxic air contaminants (TACs) must be
updated to reflect new information and changed circumstances.
90. The record further contains significant new information showing that the County failed to
evaluate or consider mitigation measures and other available alternatives that considerably differ from
6 those previously analyzed in the 2012 FEIR and that would substantially reduce one or more significant
7 effects on the environment.

8 91. The Board erroneously found, by a narrow 3-2 vote, that the County did not need to

9 address this significant new information based on res judicata grounds. Keep the Code explained in its
10 comments on the 2019 RFEIR why this basis is factually and legally inaccurate. Contrary to the Board's

11 findings, the County was required to consider this information before approving the Project.

12 92. The County prejudicially abused its discretion and violated CEQA when it approved
13 Project without preparation of a subsequent or supplemental EIR or recirculating the 2019 RDEIR
14 addressing the significant new information in the record. The County's decision to approve the Project,
15 including the MPCD Ordinance, without further environmental review is not supported by substantial
16 evidence

17 B. Misleading Notice of Completion

18 93. The County also violated CEQA by not correcting its misleading Notice of Completion

19 of the 2019 RDEIR, which told the public that: "Given the limited scope of the 2019 RDEIR, together

20 with the directives contained in the Court's remand and the requirements of CEQA Guidelines Section
21 15234(d), comments that are not related to the specific issues under review (Alternatives 4 and 5) will

22 not be responded to." (2019 RDEIR, p. 1-4, emphasis added.) This statement ass misleading and
23 suggested that the public and public agencies could not comment on significant new information that has
24 developed in the seven years since the County originally certified the 2012 FEIR.

25 C. Failure to Respond to Comments as Required by CEQA

26 94. "The evaluation and response to public comments is an is essential part of the CEQA

27 process. Failure to comply with the requirement can lead to disapproval of a project." ("Discussion"

28 following CEQA Guidelines, § 15088.) By forcing the approving agency to acknowledge, summarize

26
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

and respond to the public's concerns, the requirement "enable[s] the public to determine the
environmental and economic values of their elected and appointed officials thus allowing for appropriate
action come election day should a majority of the voters disagree." (CEQA Guidelines, § 15003, subd.
(e).)

95. Respondents must include and respond to comments in an FEIR. (CEQA Guidelines, §§
6 15132, 15088.) To pass legal muster, an agency's responses to comments must specifically explain the
reasons for rejecting suggestions received in comments and for proceeding with a project despite its
environmental impacts. Such explanations must be supported with specific references to empirical
9 information, scientific authority and/or explanatory information. The responses, moreover, must
10 manifest a good faith, reasoned analysis; conclusory statements unsupported by factual information will
11 not suffice. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15088.)

12 96. Keep the Code and other members of the public submitted extensive comments on the
13 2019 RFEIR. Yet, the County either ignored these comments or glossed over their substance with
14 conclusory responses. By disregarding these comments, the County failed to address significant new
15 information relating to alternatives as well as the project's environmental impacts, including fire hazards
16 and emergency evacuation.

17 D. Failure to Adopt Adequate Findings

18 97. The County also violated CEQA by adopting inadequate findings. In particular, the

19 findings adopted by the County are not supported by substantial evidence. These failures include, but are

20 not limited to, infeasibility findings regarding alternatives. In addition, the County's findings do not
21 provide adequate reasoning or the analytic route from facts to conclusions, required by law. The
22 Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations are also unsupported by substantial

23 evidence in the record

24 98. a As a result of the foregoing defects and others according to proof, the County

25 prejudicially abused its discretion in approving the Project without preparing a FEIR that complied with
26 CEQA. Accordingly, the County's approval of the Project is contrary to law and invalid and must be set

27 aside.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
Violation of the State Planning and Zoning Law
2 (Gov. Code, 8 10910 et seq.)

99. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their
4 entirety.

100. The County's General Plan does not reflect substantial compliance with the requirements
6 of Government Code section 65302(g)(1), which requires: "[u]pon the next revision of the housing
element on or after January 1, 2014, the safety element shall be reviewed and updated as necessary to

8 address the risk of fire for land classified as state responsibility areas, as defined in Section 4102 of the
Public Resources Code, and land classified as very high fire hazard severity zones, as defined in Section
10 51177. This review shall consider the advice included in the Office of Planning and Research's most
11 recent publication of 'Fire Hazard Planning, General Plan Technical Advice Series' and shall also
12 include all of the following:

13 (A) Information regarding fire hazards, including, but not limited to, all of the following:

14 (i) Fire hazard severity zone maps available from the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.

15 (ii) Any historical data on wildfires available from local agencies or a reference to where the data

16 can be found.

17 (iii) Information about wildfire hazard areas that may be available from the United States

18 Geological Survey.

19 (iv) General location and distribution of existing and planned uses of land in very high fire
20 hazard severity zones and in state responsibility areas, including structures, roads, utilities, and

21 essential public facilities. The location and distribution of planned uses of land shall not require

22 defensible space compliance measures required by state law or local ordinance to occur on

23 publicly owned lands or open space designations of homeowner associations.

24 (v) Local, state, and federal agencies with responsibility for fire protection, including special

25 districts and local offices of emergency services.

26 (B) A set of goals, policies, and objectives based on the information identified pursuant to
27 subparagraph (A) for the protection of the community from the unreasonable risk of wildfire.
28

28
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

(C) A set of feasible implementation measures designed to carry out the goals, policies, and
objectives based on the information identified pursuant to subparagraph (B) including, butnot
m + limited to, all of the following:
(i) Avoiding or minimizing the wildfire hazards associated with new uses of land.
(ii) Locating, when feasible, new essential public facilities outside of high fire risk areas,

6 including, but not limited to, hospitals and health care facilities, emergency shelters, emergency
command centers, and emergency communications facilities, or identifying
construction methods or other methods to minimize damage if these facilities are located in a
state responsibility area or very high fire hazard severity zone.

10 (iii) Designing adequate infrastructure if a new development is located in a state

11 responsibility area or in a very high fire hazard severity zone, including safe access for

12 emergency response vehicles, visible street signs, and water supplies for structural fire

13 suppression.

14 (iv) Working cooperatively with public agencies with responsibility for fire protection.

15 (D) If a city or county has adopted a fire safety plan or document separate from the general plan,

16 an attachment of, or reference to, a city or county's adopted fire safety plan or document that
17 fulfills commensurate goals and objectives and contains information required pursuant to this

18 paragraph."
19 (Gov. Code, § 65302, subd. (g)(3).) SB 1241 also requires that the "draft element of or draft
20 amendment to the safety element of a county or a city's general plan be submitted to the State Board of
21 Forestry and Fire Protection ('State Board') and to every local agency that provides fire protection to
22 territory in the city or county[.J" (Ibid.)

23 101. The County last updated its General Plan in 2009. The County's General Plan Housing
24 Element was updated on December 10, 2019. Because this update occurred after January 1, 2014, the
25 County was required to review and update the plan's safety element, "as necessary to address the risk of
26 fire for land classified as state responsibility areas, as defined in Section 4102 of the Public Resources
27 Code, and land classified as very high fire hazard severity zones, as defined in Section 51177." (Gov.
28 Code, § 65302, subd. (g)(3)(A).)

29
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

102. The County's General Plan neither contains safety element, nor the information
2 mandated by section 65302, subdivision (g)(3). In fact, the County has acknowledged it is currently in

3 the process of updating its General Plan to comply with these requirements and that the "remainder of
4 the County's General Plan will also need to be reviewed for consistency with the updated Safety
5 Element.3 Because the General Plan fails to comply with this mandate, any Project approvals would also

6 be out of compliance. Importantly, this includes the Project's proposed MPCD Ordinance, which would
amend the County's Zoning Code. The MCPD must conform to the General Plan. Yet, the General Plan

8 does not conform to state law. Therefore, the adoption of the MCPD would violate state law. Adopting
the MPCD it without a compliant Safety Element makes it impossible for the County to adopt findings that
10 the potential fire risks created by the coning designation is consistent with state law requirements and
11| that it would protect the lives, health, property, and natural resources of the County.

12 103. Similarly, given that the Project will increase fire risks and its location, the County

13 cannot approve the Project until its General Plan complies with state law.
14 104. An actual controversy has arisen and now exists between Petitioner and Respondents.
15 Petitioner requires a judicial determination of the rights and duties of the parties and a declaration that
16 the General Plan is invalid for non-compliance with Government Code section 65302. A judicial
17 determination is necessary and appropriate at this time and under these circumstances in order that the
18 parties may ascertain their rights and duties under the law and know the extent to which respondent's
19 general plan is lawful.

20 105. Petitioner is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that unless the County is
21 restrained and enjoined by order of this court, it will continue to engage in the above-described acts and
22 omissions constituting a violation of the CEQA and the Planning and Zoning Law.

23 106. Petitioner has no adequate remedy at law to compel the County to comply with
24 Government Code section 65302 or CEQA, nor can Petitioner be compensated adequately for the losses
25 alleged herein by an award of damages in that petitioner will not be able to determine the precise amount
26 of damage it will suffer if respondent's conduct is not restrained.

27 107. Such conduct will result in irreparable harm to Petitioner and the individuals it represents.
28 The threat of such irreparable and permanent damage justifies the issuance by this court of an injunction.

30
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 108. Petitioner seeks preliminary and permanent injunctions restraining Respondent, its
2| agents, employees, contractors, consultants and all persons acting in concert with them, from
3 undertaking any construction or development, issuing any approvals or permits, or taking any other

4 action to implement in any way the approval of the Project without full compliance with California
5 Planning and Zoning Law section 65302, and CEQA.

6 109. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents' approval of the Project is contrary to
7 law and invalid and must be set aside. Accordingly, Petitioners pray for relief as set forth below.

R THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
Violation of the Mendocino County Code

10 110. Petitioner realleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in their

entirety.
11
111.
12 State law requires that land use decisions, including approving discretionary projects,

13 comply with and be consistent with applicable county codes and zoning ordinances.

112.
14 Section 2.48.040 of the Mendocino County Code confers the Planning Commission with

15 the powers and duties set forth under the laws of the County.

16 113. Section 2.54.010 of the Mendocino County Code permits the Board of Supervisors, when

17 deemed appropriate and necessary, "to reserve to itself the functions of the planning agency when time

18 is of the essence with respect to any permit or approval, based on the project's special contribution to

19 the County's general welfare and economic or environmental wellbeing, including, but not limited to,

20 projects that provide substantial employment opportunities, support necessary government services, and

21 involve County-wide infrastructure improvements." (Emphasis added.)

114.
22 On May 21, 2019, counsel for Real Parties in Interest sent a letter to the Mendocino

23 County Board of Supervisors requesting they exercise original jurisdiction over all actions necessary to

24 comply with the court's decision regarding the County's 2012 approvals for the Harris Quarry

25 expansion, proposed asphalt plant, and Mineral Processing Combining District zoning amendment.

115.
26 On June 18, 2019, the Board of Supervisors held a public hearing on whether it should

27 exercise original jurisdiction over all future actions related to the Harris Quarry expansion project,

28 proposed asphalt plant, and zoning amendments. At the hearing, counsel for Real Parties in Interest

31
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

-

2 testified that "time was of the essence" because the quarry would be required to shut down the following
month, once it reached the 75,000 cubic yards of annual production limit imposed by its original
3 [ conditional use permit.

4 116. On June 18, 2019, the Board of Supervisors approved the request for direct review of
5 actions related to the Harris Quarry, finding that the overall project provides a special contribution to the
6 County's general welfare and economic wellbeing, pursuant to Section 2.54.010 of the Mendocino
7 County Code.

8 117. The Board of Supervisors' exercise of original jurisdiction over actions related to the
Harris Quarry project violates the Mendocino County Code by failing to meet section 2.54.010's "time
10 is of the essence" requirement. Pursuant to a December 21, 2015 peremptory writ of mandate in a
11 related matter between the same parties involved in this action, the Harris Quarry was permitted to
12 continue quarrying activities in excess of the previous permit's rate of 75,000 cubic yards per year.
13 Accordingly, and contrary to Real Party's counsel's testimony, the Harris Quarry did not face threat of
14 immediate closure because it could continue activities beyond the limits imposed by the previous
15 conditional use permit. Thus, no "urgency" existed to warrant the Board's exercise of original
16| jurisdiction under section 2.54.010.

17 118. Section 2.54.010 prohibits the Board of Supervisors from reserving original jurisdiction
18 over land use matters if doing so will conflict with any provision of Title 17 (Division of Land
19 Regulations), Title 20 (Zoning Ordinance), and Chapter 22.16 (Surface Mining and Reclamation) of the
20 Mendocino County Code, or, where State law mandates prior review by the Planning Commission. The
21 Board of Supervisors' reservation of original jurisdiction over actions related to the Harris Quarry
22 contravenes this prohibition.

23 119. Section 20.196.010 of Title 20 to the Mendocino County Zoning Code confers the
24 Planning Commission with original jurisdiction over applications for granting, extending time limits, or
25 modifying the conditions of a Major Use Permit. The Harris Quarry project requires rescission of a
26 previously-issued use permit, and issuance of a new, major use permit. Because the court ordered the
27 County to reconsider Alternatives 4 and 5 of the permit's related EIR, the Planning Commission was
28 required to exercise original jurisdiction over, or at least review and provide recommendations on the

32
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 recirculated EIR and subsequent permit approvals. By exercising original jurisdiction over the matter,
2 the Board improperly prevented the Planning Commission from exetcising this statutorily mandated

3 duty. This was prejudicial as it curtailed public review and participation. Thus, the Board of Supervisors

4 improperly exercised original jurisdiction, in direct contravention of section 20.196.010 of Title 20
5 (Zoning Code), as prohibited by section 2.54.010.

6 120. Sections 20.212.025 of Title 20 of the Mendocino County Zoning Code requires the

7 Planning Commission to conduct hearings, review, and recommend any proposed amendment,

8 alteration, or change to a zoning district. Section 20.212.030 requires the Board of Supervisors to first
9 refer any modification to a proposed zoning amendment or alteration to the Planning Commission for
10 report and recommendation, before approval. The Harris Quarry project requires amending the County's
11 Zoning Code a to add a new Mineral Processing Combining District, and subsequently applying the
12 designation to the Harris Quarry site. Because the court ordered rescission of the ordinances that created
13 the MPCD and subsequent zoning amendments, the Planning Commission is required to review and
14 provide recommendations on those newly proposed by the recirculated EIR. As a result, the Board of
15 Supervisors failed to receive the Planning Commission's input on the proposed amendments. This was
16 prejudicial as it curtailed public review and comment, and informed decisionmaking by depriving the
17 Planning Commission from holding a public hearing on the matter. As such, the Board of Supervisors
18| improperly exercised original jurisdiction, in direct contravention of sections 20.212.025 and 20.212.030
19 of Title 20 (Zoning Code), as prohibited by section 2.54.010.
20 121. Section 22.16.060 of Title 22, Chapter 22.16 of the Mendocino County Code prohibits
21 any person from conducting or expanding surface mining operations unless a permit is obtained from,
22 and a reclamation plan has been submitted to and approved by the Planning Commission for such
23 operation. Pursuant to this Section, the Planning Commission must hold a minimum of one (1) public
24| hearings for any surface mining use permit or reclamation plan. The Harris Quarry project requires
25 expansion of its surface mining operations and a new reclamation plan. The court ordered the County to
26 rescind all previously-issued surface mining permits and reclamation plan approvals. As such, those
27 contemplated by the recirculated EIR must be submitted to, and approved by the Planning Commission
28 before the project may lawfully operate. By exercising original jurisdiction over the project, the Board

33
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

of Supervisors prevented the Planning Commission from reviewing and approving the proposed

2 expansion and reclamation plan. Accordingly, the Board of Supervisors improperly exercised original
3 jurisdiction in direct contravention of section 22.16.060 of Chapter 22.16 (Surface Mining and
4 Reclamation) of the Mendocino County Code, as prohibited by section 2.54.010.

122. The County prejudicially abused its discretion in invoking original jurisdiction over
6 actions related to the Harris Quarry project by contravening section 2.54.010's "time is of the essence"
mandate, and by conflicting with provisions in Title 20 (Zoning Code) and Chapter 22.16 (Surface

8 Mining and Reclamation) that confer the Planning Commission with review and approval authority.

123. Alternatively, the Board abused its discretion in invoking original jurisdiction over
10 actions related to the Harris Quarry project by contravening section 2.54.010's "time is of the essence"
11 mandate, and by conflicting with provisions in Title 20 (Zoning Code) and Chapter 22.16 (Surface
12 Mining and Reclamation) that confer the Planning Commission with review and approval authority
13| when Real Parties testified at the December 16, 2019 Project approval hearing that Real Parties were not
14 required to shut down as they had previously represented. When the Board considered the Project on
15 December 16, 2019, there were only two weeks left in the year and there was sufficient time for
16 Planning Commission to hold a hearing and makes recommendations to the Board before any 2020
17 production limits would be implicated.

18 124. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents' approval of the project is contrary to
19 law and invalid and must be set aside. Accordingly, Petitioners pray for relief as set forth below.

20 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

21 WHEREFORE, Petitioner prays for judgment as follows:

22 l. Alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing the Board to rescind all of its
