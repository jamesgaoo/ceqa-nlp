INTRODUCTION

2 1. This action challenges the December 10, 2019 decision of Placer County and its

3 Board of Supervisors ("Respondents") to approve the Sunset Area Plan and Placer Ranch
4| Specific Plan project ("Project") and certify the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") for the
5 Project. Approval of the Project, State Clearinghouse Number 2016112012, included the
6 a following entitlements: a General Plan Amendment, the Sunset Area Plan, Placer Ranch
7 Specific Plan, a Zone Reclassification, Development Agreement, and Large Lot Vesting
8 Tentative Subdivision Map.

2. The Project, proposed by the Placer County Community Development Resource
10 Agency, would encompass a total of 8,497 acres in western Placer County. The 13.9-square mile
11 Project is bordered by the cities of Roseville to the south, Rocklin to the east, and Lincoln to the
12 north, and unincorporated Placer County to the west. The Project contains over 7,000 acres of

13 rare vernal pool habitat that supports special-status plant and wildlife species, such as vernal
14 pool fairy shrimp, western spadefoot toad, and dwarf downingia.
15 3. The Project would include 8,094 housing units in total, with 5,636 housing units
16 contained within the Placer Ranch Specific Plan area which covers 2,213 acres in the southern
17| portion of the Project. A significant portion of these housing units would be built in close
18 proximity to a sanitary landfill, subjecting residents to unpleasant and potentially unhealthy
19 odors while constraining the County's ability to provide sufficient waste disposal services for
20  existing customers.

21 4. The Project proposes mix of residential, commercial and industrial uses that will
22 generate over 500,000 additional vehicle trips each day, clogging area roadways while
23 undercutting California's greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions reduction targets.
24 5. Members of the public including the Center for Biological Diversity ("the
25 Center") raised concerns throughout the administrative process that the Project will have
26 significant negative environmental impacts on, among other things, biological resources
27 (including special status species), greenhouse gas emissions, water quality, traffic, housing

1 affordability and land use. Yet Respondents failed to disclose or adequately analyze these
2 impacts, failed to identify and adopt feasible mitigation measures to reduce them, and failed to
3 consider reasonable alternatives to the Project.

4 THE PARTIES

5 6. Petitioner CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY is a non-profit

6 conservation organization dedicated to the protection of native species and their habitats through
7 science, policy, and environmental law. The Center has approximately 68,000 members
8 worldwide, including members who reside within communities in the vicinity of the Project.
9 The Center has worked for many years to protect imperiled plants and wildlife, open space, air
10 and water quality, and the overall quality of life for people in unincorporated Placer County
11 where the Project is proposed. Members of the Center objected to the approval and construction
12 of the Project and will be directly and adversely affected by the Project.
13 7. Respondent PLACER COUNTY (the "County"), a political subdivision of the
14 State of California, is responsible for regulating and controlling land use in the unincorporated
15 territory of the County, including implementing and complying with the provisions of CEQA.
16 The County is the "lead agency" for the Project for the purposes of Public Resources Code
17 Section 21067, with principal responsibility for conducting environmental review of the Project.
18 The County has a duty to comply with CEQA and other state laws.
19 8. Respondent PLACER COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS (the "Board") is
20 the duly elected decision-making body of the County. As the decision-making body, the Board
21 is responsible for granting the various approvals necessary for the Project and for ensuring that
22 the County has conducted an adequate and proper review of the Project's environmental impacts
23 under CEQA.

24 9. Respondent PLACER COUNTY COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT RESOURCE
25 AGENCY (the "CDRA") is an agency of the County and performs all land use planning
26 functions for unincorporated areas of the County. The CDRA is the Project applicant for the
27 purposes of CEQA.

RELIEF

10. On information and belief, Real Party in Interest PLACER RANCH, INC. ("Real
2 Party in Interest"), is the owner of the property subject to the Placer Ranch Specific Plan, as
3 amended, and is currently party to a Memorandum of Understanding with the County that
4 demonstrates Real Party's intent to develop the Placer Ranch Specific Plan site following
5 approval of the Project. Real Party is also a party to the Development Agreement that was

6 approved by the Board on December 10, 2019.

7 11. Petitioner does not know the true names and capacities, whether individual,
8 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of respondents DOES 1 through 20, inclusive, and therefore
9 sue said respondents under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition to show their
10 true names and capacities when the same have been ascertained. Each of the respondents is the

11 agent and/or employee of Respondents, and each performed acts on which this action is based
12 within the course and scope of such respondent's agency and/or employment.

13 12. Petitioner does not know the true names and capacities, whether individual,
14 corporate, associate, or otherwise, of real parties in interest DOES 21 through 40, inclusive, and
15 therefore sues said real parties in interest under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this
16 Petition to show their true names and capacities when the same have been ascertained.

17 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

18 13. This Court has jurisdiction to issue a writ of mandate to set aside Respondents'
19 decision to approve the Project under California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5 (or
20 alternatively, section 1085) and Public Resources Code section 21168.5 (or alternatively, section
21 21168) and section 21168.9.

22 14. Venue for this action properly lies in the Placer County Superior Court because
23 Respondents and the proposed site of the Project are located in the County. Many of the
24 significant environmental impacts from the Project that are the subject of this lawsuit would
25 occur in Placer County, and the Project would affect the interests of Placer County residents,
26 including members of the Center.

1 15. Respondents have taken final agency actions with respect to adopting the EIR and
2 approving the Project. Respondents had a duty to comply with applicable state laws, including
3 but not limited to CEQA and the State Planning and Zoning Law, prior to undertaking the
4 I discretionary approvals at issue in this lawsuit.

5 16. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
6 21167.5 by serving a written notice of Petitioner's intention to commence this action on
7 Respondents on January 9, 2020. A copy of the written notice and proof of service is attached
8 hereto as Exhibit A.

17. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
10 21167.6 by concurrently notifying Respondents of Petitioner's request to prepare the record of
11 administrative proceedings relating to this action. A copy of the Petitioner's Election to Prepare
12 Administrative Record of Proceedings is attached hereto as Exhibit B.
13 18. Petitioner has performed any and all conditions precedent to filing this instant
14 action and has exhausted any and all administrative remedies to the extent required by law,
15 including, but not limited to, timely submitting extensive comments objecting to the approval of
16 the Project and identifying in writing to Respondents the deficiencies in Respondents'
17 environmental review for the Project on February 22, 2019 and December 7, 2019, and orally
18 during the Board's hearing December 10, 2019.
19 19. This Petition is timely filed in accordance with Public Resources Code section
20 21167 and CEQA Guidelines section 15112. •

21 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

22 The Proposed Project and Project Site

23 20. By this action, Petitioners challenge the decision of Respondents to approve the
24 Project based upon a legally inadequate EIR and inadequate findings of fact and statement of
25 overriding considerations in violation of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").
26 21. The Project is located on 8,497 acres in unincorporated western Placer County.
27 The Project site is sparsely developed, consisting predominately of agricultural land and open
28 4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE

1 space. The Project would destroy over 5,000 acres of vernal pools and associated grassland
2 habitat, threatening the survival of unique and imperiled species such as the vernal pool fairy
3 shrimp, vernal pool tadpole shrimp, and western spadefoot toad that depend on this rare and
4 imperiled habitat type.

5 22. Vernal pools are seasonally flooded depressions and swales that occur in annual
6 grasslands under the occurrence of specific climatic, soil and hydrologic conditions. Vernal pool
7 wetlands and associated upland grassland habitats ("vernal pool complex") are critical to the
8 survival of many species that carry out their entire life cycle 11 vernal pool complex habitat.
23. Nearly the entire Project area is within the Western Placer County "core area"
10 identified in the United States Fish and Wildlife Service's 2005 vernal pool recovery plan.
11 Despite the recognition of the site's importance as one of the region's last remaining vernal pool
12 strongholds, the Project would only preserve approximately 40% of the site's existing vernal
13 pool habitat-less than half of the recovery plan's goal of 85% retention.

14 24. In addition to the vernal pool species listed above, the Project site provides habitat
15 for rare and special status species of plants and wildlife including, but not limited to, western
16 pond turtle, white-tailed kite, loggerhead shrike, northern harrier, burrowing owl, Swainson's
17 hawk, valley elderberry longhornbeetle, and dwarf downingia.
18 25. Rainwater and runoff from the Project site will flow into Orchard Creek and
19 Pleasant Grove Creek, which are hydrologically connected to Auburn Ravine, which is
20 designated critical habitat for Central Valley Steelhead and Central Valley Fall-run Chinook
21 salmon, the former being federally listed as threatened and the latter being a species of special
22 concern in California. The nearest salmonid-occupied portions of Auburn Ravine are 0.75 miles
23 north of the Project site boundary.
24 26. The County claims that at buildout, the Project would result in 55,760 new jobs,
25 8,094 dwelling units, and 19,314 new residents. The County claims that the Placer Ranch
26 Specific Plan, as amended, would provide 14,956 of those jobs spread over almost 8.5 million
27 square feet of commercial, industrial, retail, and educational land uses. The EIR acknowledges

28 5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

that the significant additions of housing and jobs is projected to produce an additional 3.5
2 million vehicle miles traveled each day on area roadways. This Project-generated traffic, in
3 addition to other operational processes within the Project area, will emit 367,900 metric tons of

4 CO2-equivalent GHGs each year, according to the EIR.

5 The Projéct Approvals and EIR

6 27. On or about November 3, 2016, the County issued a Notice of Preparation
7 | (NOP") for the Project, in which it notified public agencies and interested individuals that, as a
8 lead agency, it would be preparing a Draft EIR to analyze the proposed Project's potentially

9 significant environmental impacts.

10 28. On or about December 18, 2018, Respondents published a Notice of Availability
11 of a Draft EIR for the Project and circulated the Draft EIR for public review and comment.
12 29. Petitioner and numerous others, including public agencies, organizations, and
13 individual members of the public, submitted comments pointing out serious deficiencies in the
14 Draft EIR. For example, commenters explained that the Project would have significant impacts
15 on GHGs, biological resources (including special status species), water supplies, water quality,
16 current and future capacity of public utilities, fire safety, affordable housing, traffic, and land
17 use, and that the EIR's analysis and proposed mitigation of those impacts was woefully
18 inadequate. The cities of Roseville, Lincoln and Rocklin expressed concerns with the Project's
19 cumulative impacts on transportation, the administration of public services, and other impacts on
20 the cities that were not properly addressed in the Draft EIR. Additionally, public comments
21 raised specific concerns over the Project description's failure to include stable and specific
22 projections for how buildout of the Project would proceed, and how this gap in analysis
23 undermines the EIR's assessment of the Project's jobs and housing impacts.
24 30. In a letter to the County on February 22, 2019, before the close of the comment
25 period on the Draft EIR, Petitioner commented that the Draft EIR failed to comply with CEQA
26 in the following respects:
27

28 6
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

a. The Draft EIR's analysis of and mitigation for impacts to biological resources was

2 inadequate because, inter alia, it failed to disclose, evaluate, and avoid significant

3 impacts to biological resources including special status species, vernal pools, and

4 wetlands; and

5 b. the Draft EIR's analysis of Project alternatives was inadequate because, inter alia,

6 the Draft EIR utilized an improper no-project alternative, failed to analyze a

7 reasonable range of alternatives, and failed to consider a feasible alternative that

8 would substantially lessen the Project's significant environmental impacts.

9 31. On or about October 31, 2019, the County released a Final EIR for the Project,
10 which included text changes to the Draft EIR and Respondents' responses to public comments
11 on the Draft EIR. However, the defects identified in the Draft EIR identified by Petitioner and
12 | other commenters persisted in the Final EIR.

13 32. On November 21, 2019, the Planning Commission considered the Project, and
14 voted to recommend approval. The vote was 6-1, with Commissioner Nader the lone 'no' vote.
15 Commissioner Nader had earlier submitted public comments on the Draft EIR criticizing the
16 Project's provision of housing adjacent to the landfill, stating that the Project's incompatibility
17 with the landfill "seems like a clear signal that this project as currently presented is not wise and
18 would have wide ranging negative implications to the residents of Placer County."
19 33. In a letter submitted to the County on December 6, 2019, before the final hearing
20 to approve the Project and certify the Final EIR, Petitioner described deficiencies remaining in
21 the Final EIR, commenting that the Final EIR failed to comply with CEQA in the following
22 respects:

23 a. The EIR's analysis of and mitigation for the Project's impacts to biological

24 resources, including impacts to vernal pool, wetland, and riparian habitat, as well

25 as special status species such as the federally listed vernal pool fairy shrimp, state

26 fully protected white-tailed kite, northern harrier, loggerhead shrike, western pond

27 turtle, western spadefoot toad, and dwarf downingia, remained inadequate;

15 Petitioner requested that the County revise the EIR to correct the deficiencies and recirculate the
16 revised EIR for public review and comment.
17

18 34. Respondents' Approval of the Project and Certification of the EIR
On December 10, 2019, the Board of Supervisors held a public hearing on the
19 proposed Project and Final EIR to consider whether to certify the Final EIR and approve the
20 Project. Members of the public, including members of the Center, attended the public hearing
21 and gave testimony opposing the certification of the Final EIR and approval of the Project.
22 35. At the conclusion of the December 10, 2019 hearing, the Board of Supervisors
23 adopted the Planning Commission's recommendation, certified the Final EIR, approved the
24 Project and adopted findings in support of the Project approval and EIR certification, and voted
25 to adopt a general plan amendment as well as other Project-related entitlements.
26 36.

28 On December 12, 2019, the County recorded a Notice of Determination for the
27 Project with the Governor's Office of Planning and Research, which stated that the County had
8
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

1 approved the Project, certified the EIR, and adopted Findings and a Statement of Overriding
2 Considerations.

3 37. The Notice of Determination listed the Placer County Community Development

4 Resource Agency as the sole project applicant.

5 38. As a result of Respondents' actions in approving the Project, certifying the EIR for

6 the Project, and adopting Findings and a Statement of Overriding Considerations, Petitioner and
7 its members will suffer significant and irreparable harm as described herein. Petitioner has no

8 plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at law for this irreparable harm. Unless this Court grants the
9 requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside certification of the EIR and
10 approval of the Project, Respondents' approval will remain in effect in violation of state law.
11 39. Respondents have prejudicially abused their discretion and failed to proceed in the
12 manner required by law in the following ways:

13 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

14 Violation of CEQA - Inadequate EIR (Public Resources Code § 21000, et seq.,

15 CEQA Guidelines 14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15000 et seq.)

16 40. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth
17 above.

18 41. CEQA was enacted by the legislature to ensure that the long-term protection of the
19 environment is a guiding criterion in public decisions. CEQA requires the lead agency for a
20 project with the potential to cause significant environmental impacts to prepare an EIR for the
21 project that complies with the requirements of the statute, including, but not limited to, the
22 requirement to disclose and analyze the project's potentially significant environmental impacts.
23 The EIR must provide sufficient environmental analysis such that the decisionmakers can
24 intelligently and fully consider environmental consequences when acting on the proposed
25 project. Such analysis must include and rely upon thresholds of significance that are based on
26 substantial evidence in the record.

27

28 9
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

42. CEQA also mandates that the lead agency analyze and adopt feasible and
2l enforceable mitigation measures that would reduce or avoid any of a project's significant
environmental impacts. If any of the project's significant impacts cannot be mitigated to a less
4 than significant level, then CEQA bars the lead agency from approving project if a feasible
alternative is available that would meet the project's objectives while avoiding or reducing its
significant environmental impacts.
43. CEQA requires that substantial evidence in the administrative record support all of
8 the agency's findings and conclusions, including those contained in the EIR, and that the agency
9 explain how the evidence in the record supports the conclusions the agency has reached.
10 44. Respondents committed a prejudicial abuse of discretion and failed to proceed in a
11 manner required by law because the Project relies on an EIR that fails to meet the CEQA's
12 requirements for the disclosure, analysis, mitigation, reduction, and/or avoidance of significant
13 environmental impacts from the Project, including direct and cumulative impacts to GHGs,
14 biological resources, water supplies, wäter quality, traffic, public services, and land use.
15 45. . Biological Resources,. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or
16 mitigate the Project's significant direct and cumulative impacts to biological resources,
17 including numerous wildlife and plant species affected by the Project. Those species include, but
18 are not limited to: vernal pool fairy shrimp, vernal pool tadpole shrimp, western spadefoot toad,
19 white-tailed kite, loggerhead shrike, northern harrier, Swainson's hawk, western pond turtle,
20 burrowing owl, valley elderberry longhorn beetle, Sacramento Orcutt grass, and dwarf
21 downingia. The EIR's biological resources analysis is inadequate because, inter alia, the EIR:
22 a. fails to include and fully analyze all biological resources impacts resulting from
23 the Project;
24 b. relies on mitigation measures that are vague, ineffective, deferred, and/or
25 unenforceable;
26 C. fails to incorporate all feasible mitigation or avoidance measures;

27

28 10
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

p d. fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's significant

2 impacts on habitats and features such as vernal pools, non-riparian wetlands,

3 riparian areas, and preserved lands such as the Warm Springs Mitigation Bank,

4 Moore Ranch Conservancy, Antonio Mountain Ranch, and Orchard Creek

5 Conservation Bank;

6 e. fails to adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the indirect impacts to

7 occupied salmonid habitat that is hydrologically connected to the Project site; and

co f. fails to adequately disclose, analyze and/or mitigate the direct, indirect, and

9 cumulative impacts of the Project on other biological resources, including

10 cumulative impacts to wildlife movement.

11 46. Greenhouse Gas Emissions. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or
12 mitigate the Project's significant direct. indirect, and cumulative GHG impacts. The EIR's
13 analysis of GHG impacts is inadequate because, inter alia, the EIR:
14 a. fails to include and fully analyze all GHG emissions resulting from the Project

15 b. relies on GHG mitigation measures that are vague, ineffective, deferred, and/or
16 unenforceable;

17 C. fails to incorporate all feasible mitigation and avoidance measures; and
18 d. impermissibly relies on off-site offsets to mitigate Project's GHG emissions
19 because the EIR fails to provide substantial evidence that such offsets are real,

20 permanent, quantifiable, verifiable, and enforceable reductions.

21 47. Traffic. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the
22 Project's significant direct, indirect, and cumulative traffic impacts. The EIR's analysis of traffic*
23 impacts is inadequate because, inter alia, the EIR:
24 a. fails to include and fully analyze all traffic impacts resulting from the Project;

25 b. relies on traffic mitigation measures that are vague, deferred, and unenforceable;
26 C. improperly relies on outdated "level of service" metrics when evaluating traffic
27 impacts; and

28 11
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

d. fails to incorporate all feasible mitigation and traffic reduction measures.

2 48. Water Supply and Utilities. The EIR does not adequately disclose, analyze,
3 and/or mitigate the environmental consequences of supplying water and adequate utilities
4 service to the Project. The EIR's utilities and water supply analysis is inadequate because, inter
5 alia, the EIR:

6 d. fails to include and adequately analyze the impacts of providing the Project with
7 long-term potable water supply;

8 b. fails to adequately disclose, analyze, and/or mitigate the Project's impacts on
9 groundwater;

10 C. fails to adequately analyze the impacts of providing the Project with long-term
11 wastewater treatment services;

12 d. relies on mitigation measures that are vague, ineffective, deferred, and/or
13 unenforceable, and fails to adequately assess the impacts associated with those
14 mitigation measures; and
15 e. fails to incorporate all feasible mitigation measures to reduce the impacts of
16 supplying the Project with potable water and long-term utilities service.
17 49. Hydrology and Water Quality. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze,
18 and/or mitigate the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts the Project will have on hydrology
19 and water quality. The EIR's analysis is inadequate because, inter alia, it fails to adopt feasible
20 mitigation measures to reduce the environmental impacts from Project site stormwater runoff.
21 50. Land Use. The EIR fails to adequately analyze or fully disclose or mitigate
22 inconsistencies with all applicable land use policies, and guidance, including the County's
23 General Plan.

24 51. Alternatives. The EIR fails to provide a selection and discussion of alternatives
25 for consideration that foster informed decision-making and informed public participation. The
26 alternatives analysis in the EIR does not meet CEQA's requirement that an EIR consider a
27 reasonable range of alternatives that lessen the Project's significant environmental impacts, does
28 12
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

not focus on alternatives that either eliminate adverse impacts or reduce them to insignificance

2 even if they would to some degree impede the Project's objectives, failed to consider a feasible

3 alternative that would lessen significant impacts, and unlawfully narrows the analysis by using

4 an improper no-project alternative.

5 52. Response to Comments. The responses to comments in the Final EIR fail to meet
6 CEQA's requirements in that they neither adequately dispose of all the issues raised, nor provide

7 specific rationale for rejecting suggested Project changes, including the consideration or
8 adoption of feasible mitigation measures or alternatives. CEQA requires that a lead agency

9 evaluate and respond to all environmental comments on the Draft EIR that it receives during the
10 public review period. The responses must describe the disposition of the issues raised and must
11 specifically explain reasons for rejecting suggestions and for proceeding without incorporating
12 the suggestions. The Final EIR's responses to comments fail to satisfy the requirements of law.
13 53. Based upon each of the foregoing reasons, the EIR is legally defective under
14 CEQA. Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion in violation of CEQA in approving the
15 Project. As such, the Court should issue a writ of mandate directing Respondents to set aside the
16 certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.
17 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

18 Violation of CEQA - Inadequate Findings and Statement of Overriding Considerations
19 (Public Resources Code $ 21000, et seq, CEQA Guidelines 14 Cal. Code of Regs § 15000 et
20 seq.)

21 54. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth
22 above.

23 55. Respondents' Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations violate
24 the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. Respondents' findings fail to identify the
25 changes or alterations that are required to avoid or substantially lessen the project's significant
26 environmental effects (CEQA Guidelines § 15091(a)(1), and do not provide adequate reasoning
27 or disclose the analytic route from facts to conclusions, as required by law. The purported

28 13
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

benefits of the Project cited in the Statement of Overriding Considerations do not outweigh the
2 Project's substantial costs to public health and the environment. Respondents' Findings and
3 Statement of Overriding Considerations are not supported by substantial evidence in the record.
4 (CEQA Guidelines, § 15091(b).)

5 56. When an EIR concludes that a project would result in significant environmental

6 effects, but where mitigation measures and alternatives identified in the EIR are deemed
7 infeasible, the CEQA findings must identify the specific economic, legal, social and
8 technological and other considerations that make infeasible the adoption of mitigation measures

q or alternatives. All CEQA findings must be supported by substantial evidence in the record and
10 must disclose the analytical route by which approval of a project is justified. Here, the findings
11 regarding the impacts, mitigation measures, and alternatives relied upon by Respondents'
12 approval of the Project are not supported by substantial evidence in the record, and do not
13 disclose the links between evidence and conclusions.

14 57. Respondents' Findings of Fact and Statement of Overriding Considerations fail to
15 reflect the independent judgment of Respondents.
16 58. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents failed to proceed in a manner
17 required by law, and their decision to approve the Project and adopt Findings of Fact and a
18 Statement of Overriding Considerations was not supported by substantial evidence.
19 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

20 Violation of State Planning and Zoning Law
21 (Government Code § 65300, et seq.)
22 59. Petitioner hereby incorporates by reference each and every allegation set forth
23 above.

24 60. The California State Planning and Zoning Law requires the legislative body of
25 each county to adopt a general plan for the physical development of the county. The County's
26 General Plan is a fundamental land use planning document and serves as the "constitution" for

27

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE
RELIEF

future development within the County. Land use decisions, including the approvals associated
2 with the Project, must be consistent with the General Plan.

3 61. The Project is inconsistent with mandatory Placer County General Plan policies,
4 including, but not limited to, policies governing the siting of landfill facilities and adjacent land
5 uses (such as policies 4.G.11, 4.G.5 and 4.G.6); policies requiring the protection of vernal pool
6 and wetland habitats (such as policies 6.B.2 and 6.B.5, among others); policies mandating the
7 protection of agricultural land from conversion to urban uses (such as policies 7.A.1 and 7.A.8);
8 and policies requiring the provision of affordable housing for projects proposing a specific plan

9 and the location of those units (such as 2.B.4 through 2.B.7).

10 62. By approving: project inconsistent with the County's General Plan, Respondents
11 prejudicially abused their discretion and violated provisions of the State Planning and Zoning
12 Law, requiring invalidation of the County's approvals.

13 PRAYER FOR RELIEF

14 1. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to vacate
15 and set aside certification of the EIR, adoption of the Findings and Statement of Overriding
16 Considerations, and approval of all associated Project permits, entitlements, and approvals;
17 2. For alternative and peremptory writs of mandate directing Respondents to comply
18 with CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines and take any other action as required by Public
19 Resources Code section 21168.9;

20 3. For a temporary stay, temporary restraining order, and preliminary and permanent
21 injunctions restraining Respondents or Real Parties, and their agents, servants, and employees,
22 and all others acting in concert with them or on their behalf, from taking any action to
23 implement, fund or construct any portion or aspect of the Project, pending full compliance with
24 the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines;
25 4. For a declaration that Respondents' actions in certifying the EIR and approving
26 the Project violated CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines, and that the certification and approvals

27

r are invalid and of no force or effect, and that the Project is inconsistent with other applicable
2 plans, policies, or regulations;

3 5. For costs of the suit;

4 6. For attorney's fees as authorized by Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and
5 other provisions of law; and,

6 7. For such other and future relief as the Court deems just and proper.
