13 BACKGROUND FACTS
14 . PETITIONER'S ORIGINAL CHALLENGE TO THE PROJECT
15 9. On October 4, 2017, Respondents originally approved the Project based upon a
16 Notice of Exemption. On November 9, 2017, Petitioners filed a Petitioner for Writ of Mandate
17 in Placer County Superior Court challenging Respondents' approval of the Project on the
18 grounds that it violated the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act, Public
19 Resources Code, section 21000 et seq., City of Roseville Zoning Code section 19.78.060(B)(3);
20 and Government Code, section 65300 et seq. (Threlkel v. City of Roseville, Placer County
21 Superior Court, Case No. CV0040328.

22 10. On December 5,2018, the Court issued a Judgment Granting Petition for Writ of
23 Mandate on the grounds that the approval of the Project violated CEQA as the record did not
24 contain substantial evidence to support the City's determination that the Project would not
25 significantly effect air quality. The court denied Petitioners' remaining allegations with respect
26 to CEQA, City of Roseville Municipal Code, section 19.78.060(B)(3) and Government Code,
27 section 65300.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 4

I 11. On January 16, 2019, Respondents complied with the Court's Writ of Mandate and

2 vacated the October 4, 2017 approvals for the Project.
c v1o B. THE PROJECT AND PROJECT SITE

12. On January 18, 2019, Real Parties filed a new application for a Design Review
Permit (PL19-0013). The new application is substantially similar to the previously approved
development with minor changes to the site design and elevations.

13. 0 The Project is located at 4701 Fiddyment Road, Roseville, California (APN 017-
162-067-000). The Project is the construction of a 8,802 square-foot mixed-use commercial

9 building consisting of 3,977 square feet of retail, 1,938 square feet of restaurant space, and 2,887
square feet for a convenience store. The Project also includes a 3,310 square-foot gas station 10

11 canopy with 5 fuel bays/10 pumps. The Project also includes site improvements such as parking,

12 lighting, and landscaping.

13 14. The 1.38-acre site is part of the West Roseville Specific Plan (WRSP) and is

14 surrounded by residential development to the north, south and east. Fiddyment Road, a
15 residential development and a park site exist to the west. A 50-foot wide public right of way

16 easement is located directly behind the site (to the east) that was originally anticipated for the -

17 construction of Fiddyment Road. The alignment of Fiddyment Road was subsequently

18 reconfigured and the right of way located behind the building has been partially improved with |

19 landscaping adjacent to the Crocker Ranch residential subdivision and an eight-foot wide

20 sidewalk. In 2014, as part of the WRSP Specific Plan Amendment (SPA) 3 project, the property|

21 was rezoned from Single Family Residential/Development Standards (R1/DS) to CC.

22 C. APPROVAL OF THE PROJECT

23 15. On September 26, 2019 the City of Roseville's Planning Commission approved a
24 Design Review Permit to allow the construction of the Project. As part of the approval, the
25 Planning Commission approved an Addendum to the 2004 West Roseville Specific Plan

26 Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") and the 2014 Fiddyment Ranch Specific Plan Amendment

27 3 Subsequent EIR ("SEIR") for the Project. The Addendum held that the Project is consistent

H

2 with the previously certified EIR and SEIR and that the Project will not generate new significant|
impacts or substantially more severe impacts that previously analyzed.

16, On October 7, 2019, Petitioners timely filed an appeal of the Planning
Commission's approval based on concerns related to inconsistency with the City of Roseville
Zoning Ordinance and violations of CEQA.

M 0 17. On December 18, 2019, the City Council held a public hearing on Petitioners'
appeal; of the Planning Commission's approval of the Addendum and Project. At the conclusion

9 of the hearing, the City Council adopted a Resolution "Denying the Appeal From the September

10 26, 2019 Approval by the Planning Commission, Adopting the Four Findings of Fact for the

11 Design Review Permit and Approving the Design Review Permit."

18.

12 On December 19, 2019, Respondents filed a Notice of Determination with the

13 County Clerk of Placer County as provided for in Public Resources Code, section 21152.

14 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

15 AND INADEQUACY OF REMEDY

19.

16 Petitioners have performed any and all conditions precedent to filing the instant
action and have exhausted

17 law. any and all available administrative remedies to the extent required byl

18 20.

19 Petitioners have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code, section

20 21167.5 by mailing written notice of this action to the Respondents. A copy of this written

21 notice and proof of service are attached as Exhibit A to this Petition for Writ of Mandate.

21.

22 Petitioners have complied with Public Resources Code section 21167.6 by

23 concurrently filing a request concerning preparation of the record of administrative proceedings
relating to this action.

24 22.

25 Petitioners have no plain, speedy or adequate remedy in the course of ordinary law

26 unless this Court grants the requested writ of mandate to require Respondents to set aside their

27 approval of the Project. In the absence of such remedies, Respondents' approval will remain in
effect in violation of State law.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE -

6

n HN0 TADP 00 23. This action has been brought within 30 days of the filing of the Notice of
Determination as required by Public Resources Code section 21167(b).
STANDING

24. Petitioners have standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because -
Petitioners' aesthetic, environmental and property interests are directly and adversely affected by
Respondents' approval of the Project.

ARBITRARY AND CAPRICIOUS ACTIONS

24. Petitioners bring this action on the basis, among others, of Government Code

10 section 800, and other applicable laws, which award Petitioners' attorneys' fees in actions to

1 overturn agency decisions that are arbitrary and capricious, such as the decisions in question in
this action.
Ss2 CAUSES OF ACTION

14 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

15 Abuse of Discretion Violation of CEQA, Public Resources Code, 8 21000 et seq.

16 25. Petitioners reallege and incorporate herein, as if set forth in full, each and every

17 allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 24.

18 26. A lead agency must prepare an addendum to previously certified EIR when

19 changes or additions to the EIR are necessary but none of the conditions in CEQA Guidelines,

20 section 15162 triggering preparation of a subsequent EIR have occurred. (CEQA Guidelines, ยง

21 15164(a).) CEQA, however, requires that a subsequent or supplemental EIR be required if

22 substantial changes proposed in the project will require major revisions of the EIR. (Pub.

23 Resources Code, ยง 21166(a).) The subsequent inquiry should focus on the environmental

24 consequences of a project change. (CEQA Guidelines, ยง 15162(a)(1).) A change in a project

25 requires preparation of a subsequent EIR if: (1) the change in the project is substantial; (2) the

26 change involves new or more severe significant environmental impacts; (3) the change will

27 require major revisions to the previous EIR based on the new or more severe impacts; and (4) the

28 new or more severe impacts were not considered in the previous EIR.

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 7

P 00 t.a 27. In the present matter, the record demonstrates that the change of the project to
include a gas station at this location and adjacent to neighborhood constitutes a substantial
change in the project as gas stations were not contemplated in this location. Additionally,
neither the West Roseville Specific Plan EIR nor the Fiddyment Ranch Specific Plan
Amendment 3 Subsequent EIR evaluated the air quality issues associated with gas station and
the release of toxic air contaminants associated with the operation of a gas station.
28. Information provided by Dr. Markus Hilpert, an associate professor in the
Department of Environmental Health at Columbia University identifies the new and more severe
9 environmental impacts addressed in the EIR and Subsequent EIR. These new and more severe
10 impacts were not considered in the previous EIRs. (See 2004 WRSP EIR, pages 17-26; 2014
11 SPA3 SEIR at pages 17-27; see also Addendum at pages 16-19.)
12 29, As Respondents' reliance on an Addendum is not supported by substantial
13 evidence, approval of the Project constituted prejudicial abuse of discretion and is contrary to
14 law.

15
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 16 (Violation of City of Roseville Municipal Code ยง 19.26.040(F); Code of Civil Procedure ยง 1094.5) 17
30. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 29. 18
31. Roseville Municipal Code section 19.26.040(F) provides that loading shall be 19

20 provided as follows:
a. No Maneuvering Within Public Rights-of-Way. All site designs shall 21 be designed so as to prevent truck back-up maneuvering within the 22 public right-of-way.
b. Design. The location, number, size and access of the loading area 23 shall be determined pursuant to design review.
24 32. Although the Project includes 3,977 square feet of retail space, 1938 square feet
25 of restaurant space, 2,887 square feet for a convenience store, 53 parking spaces, 10 fuel
26 pumps, 2 trash enclosures, and 2 driveways on 1.38 acres, it does not include a loading zone
27 or loading area in violation of the section 19.26.040.

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE 8

L 33.

N As the Project does not include a loading area/zone and violates section 19.26.040

auA0 approval of the Project constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion and is contrary to is law.
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION (Violation of City of Roseville Municipal Code ยง 19.78.060(B)(3);

34. Code of Civil Procedure ยง 1094.5)

35. Petitioners reallege and incorporate by reference paragraphs 1 through 33.

co City of Roseville Municipal Code section 19.78.060 requires that the Approving
Authority shall make four findings in order to approve a Design Review Permit. Finding 2
requires that:
9 02: The project site design as approved provides open space; access; vehicle parking; vehicle, pedestrian, and bicycle circulation; pedestrian walks and links to

12 alternative modes of transportation; loading areas; landscaping, irrigation, and lighting which results in safe, efficient, and harmonious development; and which is consistent with the applicable goals, policies, and objectives set forth in the

13 General Plan, the Community Design Guidelines, and the applicable Specific Plan and/or applicable design guidelines. (Roseville Municipal Code, 19.78.060(B)(2) [emphasis added].)

14 36.

15 Although the Project includes 3,977 square feet of retail space, 1938 square feet

16 of restaurant space, 2,887 square feet for a convenience store, 53 parking spaces, 10 fuel

17 pumps, 2 trash enclosures, and 2 driveways on 1.38 acres, it does not include a loading zone

18 or loading area in violation of the sections 19.78.060(B)(2) and 19.26.040.

37.

19 As the Project does not include a loading area/zone, substantial evidence does not
support the City's findings under section 19.78.060(B)(2).

20 38.

21 As Respondents' findings are not supported by substantial evidence and are

22 contrary to law, approval of the Project constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion.
PRAYER

23 -

24 Wherefore, Petitioners respectfully request the following relief and entry of judgment as

follows:

25 1.

26 That this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate ordering Respondents to:
(a)

27 vacate and set aside its approval of the Project grounds that it violates the

12 2. For a declaration that Respondents' actions in approving the Project violated

13 CEQA, and the City of Roseville Municipal Code, as set forth above;

17 Project in any way pending full compliance with CEQA, the CEQA Guidelines, and the City's
18 Municipal Code;
