19 INTRODUCTION

20 1 . Petitioners bring this action seeking to obtain court orders preventing
21 Respondents/defendants, California Department of Public Health, Sandra Shewry, Dr.
22 Erica Pan, the Harm Reduction Coalition of Santa Cruz County, and Denise Elerick
23 (hereinafter collectively "Respondents") from instituting, maintaining and approving a

24 heedle exchange program that does not comport with the legal requirements necessary
25 to ensure the health and safety of the public at large. Indeed, the needle exchange
26 program, which was authorized to commence on or about August 7, 2020, poses a
27 serious threat to the health and safety of the citizens of Santa Cruz County. Finally, this
28 action challenges the violation of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") by

Petition and Complaint

1 Respondents, California Department of Public Health, Sandra Shewry, and Dr. Erica Pan

2 (hereinafter "State Respondents') because they have entirely failed to perform the
3 required environmental review needed for the distribution, collection and disposal of used

4 needles.

5 2. Petitioners are also bringing this action because the state authorized
6 heedle exchange program does not comport with local legal requirements or local
7 ordinances. The County of Santa Cruz already operates a locally authorized Syringe
8 Exchange Program (SEP) under the oversight of the Santa Cruz County Health Services
9

10 Agency ("HSA"). The HSA operations, under the oversight of the Santa Cruz County

11 Board of Supervisors, engage in public outreach and the development of local policy to

12 address the needs of Santa Cruz County Residents. The HSA's SEP program is

13 accountable to residents of each of the four (4) incorporated Cities of Santa Cruz County

14 (Capitola, Santa Cruz, Scotts Valley, and Watsonville) and residents of the

15 unincorporated County.

3.
16 In contrast, the Harm Reduction Coalition of Santa Cruz County

17 Khereinafter "HRCSCC") has undermined the local health and safety of Santa Cruz

18 County residents and is in direct conflict with local policy actions and land use

19 brdinances. HRCSCC operates through a random collection of "volunteers" who have

20 ho responsibility to abide by State regulations much less the norms of community safety

21 land local rules and regulations. HRCSCC's operations have led to a documented

22 increase in discarded needles in Santa Cruz County, including more than 2,000 dirty

23 needles collected from one distribution site alone. Furthermore, HRCSCC operations

24 have resulted in a drastic decrease in the number of clients seen at the HSA, thereby
25 reducing their opportunity for medical care, HIV/Hepatitis testing, and rehabilitation
26 referrals.

27 4. The HRCSCC and the California Department of Public Health have
a 28 created a public nuisance that is injurious and offensive to the senses and public welfare,

3

Petition and Complaint

1

1 have caused economic blight, environmental and public safety impacts, and economic
2 harm to Santa Cruz County residents. The HRCSCC has undermined and is in direct
3 conflict with professionally trained and managed local health and human services
4 programs operated through the HSA. The HRCSCC undermines professionally trained

5 staff by providing services and activities that are operated by an ad-hoc unaccountable

6 collection of volunteers who distribute tens of thousands of hypodermic needles which
7 F'litter" parks, residential neighborhoods, beaches, rivers, public places, and the business
8 districts of the City of Santa Cruz and throughout Santa Cruz County.
9 PARTIES
10 5.
11 Petitioner/Plaintiff Grant Park Neighborhood Association Advocates,

12 Melissa Freebairn, Johnny Font, Kevin Vogel, and Renee Golder are a broad and diverse

13 group of individual people and Plaintiffs: The Grant Park Neighborhood Association

14 Advocates are founders of a neighborhood association materially affected by the public

15 consumption of illegal drugs and the needle distribution program authorized and

16 bperated by the Respondents, and located adjacent to the operations of the Santa Cruz

17 County Health Services Agency; Melissa Freebairn is a nurse who is a resident of the

18 City of Santa Cruz; Johnny Font is a resident of the City of Santa Cruz, who stepped on a

19 dirty needle at a beach in the City of Santa Cruz; Kevin Vogel is a resident of the City of

20 Santa Cruz and the former Chief of the Santa Cruz City Police Department; and Renee

21 Golder is a resident of the City of Santa Cruz and although she asserts the action

22 individually, she is a current member of the Santa Cruz City Council and former member
23 of the Citizens Public Safety Taskforce of the City of Santa Cruz. What each of the
24 Petitioners share in common is that they have been egregiously harmed by an unlawful
25 hypodermic needle distribution program, erroneously approved by the California
26 Department of Public Health and the State Health Officer without any environmental
27 review, without any outreach to long-standing neighborhood associations, that is
28 operated by an ad hoc unaccountable collection of volunteers, and who spread tens of

Petition and Complaint

T Ithousands of used and unused hypodermic needle "litter" throughout the parks, beaches,

2 residential landscape, public places, and the business environment of the City of Santa

3 Cruz and Santa Cruz County. The needle exchange distribution program has created a
4 serious threat to health and safety not just for the people of Santa Cruz, but also ranging
5 Ithroughout Santa Cruz County and beyond due to the high number of visitors who travel
6 EO Santa Cruz County. It was approved by the State Respondents in violation of the law
7 land is being operated in violation of the law.
8 6. Petitioner/Plaintiff Melissa Freebairn has been a resident of the County of
9

10 Santa Cruz for over 30 years. For the past eleven (11) years she has been a registered

11 hurse. As a a parent of a young daughter, she constantly fears that she or her daughter

12 will be injured from needle litter. She and her daughter regularly find and dispose of dirty

13 heedles around their neighborhood. She consistently finds needles especially during the

14 winter months on the beach at Seabright and Rivermouth, near the Lost Boys Bridge and

15 down in the beach flats area along the San Lorenzo River Mouth (a City designated

16 park). Needle litter from the needle distribution program specially and directly threatens

17 the health and safety of Petitioner and her family, who encounter needle litter in their

18 heighborhood and in the course of their visits to local parks and beaches.

19 7. Petitioner/Plaintiff Johnny Font has been a resident of the City of Santa

20 Cruz for over thirty (30) years. He is a retired contractor and current health coach. Mr.

21 Font suffered injury to his foot when he stepped on a used drug needle, while with his

22 daughters, on Cowell Beach on Father's Day in 2012. Mr. Font continues to find and

23 dispose of dirty needles at Cowell Beach on the shoreline and on various locations along

24 the beach. During his visits to the beach, Mr. Font has frequently seen young children

25 and their parents pick up needles at the beach and walk them over to the lifeguards. The

26 ongoing needle litter has made Mr. Font more vigilant when visiting the beach which he

27 does regularly. Needle litter from the needle distribution program specially and directly

28 threatens the health and safety of Petitioner, who encounters needle litter in his
heighborhood and in the course of his visits to local parks and beaches.

5

Petition and Complaint

1 8. Petitioner/Plaintiff Kevin Vogel has been a resident of the City/County of
2 Santa Cruz for 31.5 years. He was a member of the Santa Cruz City Police Department
3 for 30 years, from February 9, 1987 until he retired on June 1, 2017. He served as Santa
4 Cruz City Chief of Police for nearly seven (7) years from December 9, 2010 through June
5 , 2017. As a consequence of the needle distribution program he is specifically and
6 directly negatively impacted by the negative health and safety impacts of an all-volunteer
7

8 heedle distribution program. As a former Police Chief and safety-conscious city resident,
he constantly fears that he or his family members will be injured from needle litter.
9 9.
10 Petitioner/Plaintiff Renee Golder has been a resident of the City/County of

11 Santa Cruz for over 40 years. She served on the City's Public Safety Task force in

12 2012/2013. For the past 20 years, she has worked as a bilingual elementary school

13 teacher. She also spends her personal time enjoying the outdoors, biking, running and

14 hiking at local beaches and parks. Although she asserts this matter individually, she is

15 lalso a current Santa Cruz City Councilmember. As a parent of two teenage kids, who

16 also spend their free time at beaches and parks, she constantly fears that she or her

17 lfamily members will be injured from needle litter. Needle litter from the needle distribution

18 program specially and directly threatens the health and safety of Petitioner and her

19 family, who encounter needle litter in their neighborhood and in the course of their visits

20 to local parks and beaches on a weekly basis.

21 10. Grant Park Neighborhood Association Advocates are representative core

22 members of Grant Park Neighbors, a special project of Ante Meridiem, Inc., a 501(c)3

23 California Corporation Nonprofit. In December 2018, neighbors in the immediate
24 proximity of the City of Santa Cruz's Grant Park gathered as stakeholder advocates for
25 the public space located at 150 Grant Street, Santa Cruz, CA 95060. Currently with over
26 120 self-identified volunteers, Grant Park Neighbors has a mission to advocate for a
27 beautiful, clean, and safe neighborhood on behalf of local residents and to promote the
28 health and safety of Grant Park. Brad Angell, as a founding member and director of

Petition and Complaint

Grant Park Neighbors, asserts this petition/complaint on behalf of the representative core
2 members defined as the Grant Park Neighborhood Association Advocates.

3 11. As a consequence of the needle distribution program Mr. Angell is

4 specially and directly negatively impacted and receives constant neighborhood
5 comments from members of his group that they will not utilize the neighborhood park due
6 the fear of needle litter and drug users. The park is located in a residential
7 heighborhood and features a basketball court, bocce ball court, bicycle pump track,
8 playground, youth ball fields, fenced dog area, picnic table, and barbecue pits. The park
9

10 is located adjacent to the needle exchange distribution site and therefore provides a

11 location for open drug use. Unfortunately, the public restrooms at that park are often

12 closed due to misuse, including the deposit of drug needles in the toilets that have

13 regularly clogged the toilets. Grant Park itself has been closed on multiple times in the

14 past three years due to needle debris and other, typically drug-based, nuisance activities.

15 This belief of health and safety risks at public spaces negatively impacts the desirability

16 to visit local parks and the general quality of life in the City of Santa Cruz. Mr. Angell

17 regularly communicates with GPN members, local elected officials, and local government

18 staff on behalf of the park and the neighborhood to increase the health and safety of his

19 heighborhood and city.

20 12. Respondent and Defendant California Department of Public Health

21 ("CDPH") is, and at all times herein mentioned was, a state department within the

22 California Health and Human Services Agency and was created under the laws and

23 regulations of the State of California. (Health & Safety Code, § 131000.) CDPH is
24 charged with implementing Health and Safety Code section 121349, et seq. On or about
25 Friday, August 7, 2020, Respondent CDPH acted to authorize HRCSCC to begin needle
26 distribution operations in the City and County of Santa Cruz. Just two (2) days later, on
27 or about late Sunday, August 9, 2020, State Public Health Officer and Director Sonia

28

Petition and Complaint

1 Angell, MD, MPH resigned her position. Sonia Angell was succeeded by Respondent
2 Sandra Shewry and Respondent Dr. Erica Pan.

3 13. Respondent Sandra Shewry ("Shewry") is, and at all times since about

4 August 10, 2020, has been, the Interim Director of CDPH. Shewry is sued in her official

5 capacity. As the Interim Director of CDPH, she has the legal duty to ensure that CDPH
6 complies with Health & Safety Code § 121349 et seq. and/or other applicable laws which
7 may include, but are not limited to, the California Environmental Quality Act.
8 14. Respondent Dr. Erica Pan ("Pan") is, and at all times since about August
9

10 10, 2020 has been, the Acting State Public Health Officer. Pan is sued in her official

11 capacity. As the Acting State Public Health Officer, Dr. Pan has the legal duty to ensure

12 that CDPH complies with Health & Safety Code § 121349 et seq. and/or other applicable

13 laws which may include, but are not limited to, the California Environmental Quality Act.

15.
14 Petitioners are informed and believe and thereon allege that Respondent/

15 Defendant and Real Party In Interest HRCSCC is an ad-hoc, volunteer-run organization

16 with an unknown legal status that has twice applied to CDPH, most recently on

17 November 20, 2019, seeking authority to distribute syringes to intravenous drug users in

18 the City and the County of Santa Cruz, California.

19 16. Respondent/Defendant and Real Party In Interest Denise Elerick is

20 believed to be a resident of Aptos, California, an unincorporated town in the County of

21 Santa Cruz. She is believed to be the founder of the HRCSCC and according to

22 HRCSCC's CDPH SEP Application self-identified as HRCSCC's applicant and as its

23 "Coordinator." On or about March 2019, Respondent Denise Elerick submitted

24 HRCSCC's first CDPH SEP application. According to an April 18, 2019 Santa Cruz

25 Sentinel News Article, the HRCSCC program was described to operate separate from
26 lexisting Santa Cruz County-led needle exchange efforts. On or about November 20,
27 2019, Respondent Denise Elerick submitted HRCSCC's second CDPH SEP application.
28 According to HRCSCC's second application, Respondent Denise Elerick described the

8

Petition and Complaint

HRCSCC as "a volunteer-run community organization serving people who use drugs in
2 Santa Cruz County and thereby improving the health of the entire community." Further,
3 Respondent Denise Elerick signed in her individual capacity an acknowledgement and
4 attestation that upon HRCSCC certification that she and her organization "will comply
5 with state laws, regulations, and local ordinances."
17. Respondents/Defendants Does I through 50 and Real Parties In Interest
51 through 100 are the agents, employees, contractors, alter egos, and/or entities acting

8 under the authority of each other respondent and defendant or real party in interest, and
9 each performed and participated in the acts upon which this action is based. Each of
10 such Doe respondents/defendants acted within the cause and scope of such agency
11 and/or employment. Petitioners do not know the true names and capacities, whether
12

13 lindividual, corporate, or 1 otherwise, of Does 1 through 100, inclusive, and therefore sue

14 said respondents and defendants under fictitious names. Petitioners will amend this

15 Complaint and Petition to show their true names and capacities when they have been

ascertained.
16

17 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

18 18. This court has jurisdiction pursuant to section 10 of article VI of the

19 California Constitution and Code of Civil Procedure.

20 19. Venue is proper with this court as Petitioners have asserted

21 claims against a department of the State of California and an officer/s of the State in

22 their official capacity and this action has been filed in a county in which the Attorney

23 General maintains offices pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 401.2.

24 BACKGROUND OF ACTION
STATUTORY & REGULATORY BACKGROUND
25

26 Clean Needle and Syringe Exchange Programs.

27 20. Health and Safety Code § 121349(c) provides that upon application by
28 qualified parties, CDPH may authorize said applicant to provide hypodermic needle and

9

Petition and Complaint

1 syringe exchange services consistent with state standards in certain locations as
2 determined by CDPH. This is commonly known as a "Clean Needle and Syringe
3 Exchange Program."

4 21. Under applicable law, the CDPH is required to consult with the local
5 health officer and local law enforcement leadership prior to authorizing a hypodermic

6 heedle and syringe exchange program. Only after consulting with the local health officer
7 land local law enforcement leadership and balancing their concerns can any such
8 lauthorization be approved or granted. (Health & Saf. Code, § 121349(c).)
9 22. Health and Safety Code § 121349(d) requires that, in order for CDPH to
10 lssue the authorization, the applicant must demonstrate that it is qualified as provided by
11
law and that it can and will comply with certain minimum standards. These minimum
12

13 standards include establishing that the entity can provide certain services, including drug

14 labuse treatment, HIV/hepatitis screening, Hepatitis A and. B vaccination, screening for

15 sexually transmitted infections, etc.; that the entity has the capacity to commence needle

16 land syringe exchange services within three months of authorization; that the entity has

17 ladequate funding to provide needle and syringe exchange services for all of its

18 participants, to provide HIV and viral hepatitis prevention education service for all of its

19 participants and to provide for the safe recovery and disposal of used syringes and

20 sharps waste from all of its participants; and that the entity has the capacity, and

21 established plan, to collect evaluative data in order to assess program impact, including

22 total number of persons served, total number of syringes and needles distributed,
23 recovered and disposed of, and total numbers and types of referrals to drug treatment
24 and other services. (Health & Saf. Code, § 121349(d).)

25 23. CDPH has also issued rules and regulations regarding the authorization
26 of the hypodermic needle and syringe exchange services. (See, Cal. Code Regs., tit. 17,
27 § 7000 et seq.) As it relates to the application, title 17, § 7002(a), of the Code of
28 Regulations sets forth the requirements for the application, which include, but are not

10

Petition and Complaint

1 limited to, a description of services, anticipated number of participants to be served each
2 year, estimated number of syringes to be dispensed and collected each year, a copy of

3 various plans that must meet certain regulatory criteria and that guide the operation of

4 the Clean Needle and Syringe Exchange Program as well as collection and dispensing of
5 heedles, and a signed a statement attesting to various criteria, including compliance with

6 law and capacity to begin syringe exchange services within 90 days.
7 24. In addition, title 17, section 7004, of the Code of Regulations imposes a
8 mandatory and non-discretionary duty upon CDPH, requiring it to reject an application if
9 any of the following deficiencies exist:
10 (a) Information submitted in the application is incorrect or incomplete;
11
(b) The applicant does not meet all the requirements listed in Health
12
and Safety Code § 121349;
13
(c) Evidence of project harm to public safety, presented by local law
14

15 enforcement official(s), is, in the department's judgment, greater than evidence of

16 projected benefits to public health.

25.
17 In addition, title 17, section 7002 (a)(5)(c) of the Code of Regulations

18 also imposes a mandatory and non-discretionary duty upon CDPH, requiring it to reject

19 an application unless it, among other requirements, "Ip]rovides for the safe recovery and

20 disposal of used syringes and sharps waste from all its participants."

21 26. Finally, title 17, section 7002 (a) also imposes a time period by which

22 to issue a final decision within 30 days of after the close of the 90-day public comment

23 period requiring that, "Pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section 121349, the
24 department, after consultation with the local health officer and local law enforcement
25 leadership, shall issue a final decision to certify or not to certify within 30 days after the

26 close of the 90-day public comment period."

Petition and Complaint

Legislative Findings on Public Health Risks of Discarded Needles

2 27.. The California State Legislature has made express findings as to the
3 public health risks posed by improperly discarded needles. In enacting the Safe Needle

4 Disposal Act of 2004, the Legislature found the following: (1) Every year, more than 2
5 pillion needles and syringes are used outside of healthcare settings; (2) Most of these
6 needles are improperly stored and then are placed in either municipal trash or recycling
containers, thereby posing serious health risks to children, workers and the general
8 public. (Stats. 2004, C. 157 (S.B. 1362, §1)).
9 28. Similarly, in amending the Medical Waste Management Act, the
10 Legislature found that improperly discarded needles present "substantial risks to children,
11
workers and the general public." Improperly discarded needles pose a "serious health
12
threat" to workers who sort and collect waste because they are "exposed to the danger of
13

14 being stabbed by needles that poke through clothing, including heavy gloves and boots.

15 This could result in serious injury, including infection by pathogens either from the needle

16 user or by pathogens that adhere to a needle." (Assem. Com., Off. of Assem. Floor

17 Analysis, Rep. on Senate Bill No. 1305 (2005-2006 Reg. Sess.) June 16, 2006.)

18 THE NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAM IN THE COUNTY OF SANTA CRUZ
STATEMENT OF FACTS

19 Epidemic of Discarded Needles in Santa Cruz
20

21 29. The City and County of Santa Cruz have been battling an epidemic of

22 discarded needles for many years. Tens of thousands of dirty syringes have been found
23 littering Santa Cruz's streets, parks, public spaces, and beaches.

24 30. Discarded needles have impacted the water infrastructure in Santa Cruz
25 in that public restrooms have had to be shut down due to needles clogging the toilets.

26 Needles have also made their ways down storm drains and gotten stuck in drainage
27 systems. There have been numerous needle stick injuries, including needle stick injuries
28 to children and residents utilizing municipal public spaces such as beaches and parks.

12

Petition and Complaint

1 The testing and prophylactic treatment after a needle stick injury is anxiety provoking,
2 constitutes a financial burden for many individuals, is not without side effects, and is not

3 always effective.

4 31. The issue of discarded needles has reached such a volume in Santa Cruz

5 that it significantly impacts community access to parks and beaches and local recreation
6 programs such as the City of Santa Cruz Parks and Recreation Junior and Little Guards
7 Program (a City of Santa Cruz ocean and beach youth program that provides quality
8 water safety education, physical conditioning, and understanding and respect for the

! 9 environment). Many parents of youth participants do not feel safe bringing their children
10 to City parks and beaches. These fears are well-founded, given the sheer number of
11

12 dirty needles being found at public spaces, and the number of reported needle stick
injuries.
13
32.
14 Discarded needles also cause significant and substantial economic blight,

15 las needles are frequently found at or near businesses. Customers and potential

16 customers are understandably turned off by the sight of biohazardous waste at business

17 lestablishments. Furthermore, with its many beaches and Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk

18 amusement park, the City and County of Santa Cruz heavily relies upon the tourism

19 industry for tax revenue to support city programs and services. Used, discarded needles

20 tarnish the reputation of Santa Cruz as a clean and safe place to visit. This belief of

21 health and safety risks at public spaces negatively impacts the desirability to visit local

22 parks and the general quality of life in the City of Santa Cruz.

23 33. As a result of public outcry regarding discarded needles, there is an
24 extensive recent history of public policy that has formed around syringe programs in the

25 City of Santa Cruz and County of Santa Cruz. This history includes the coordinated
26 transition away from non-medical volunteer, privately-run programs, to a County-run SEP a
27 Syringe Services Program ("SSP"). The HRCSCC project is an attempt to undermine

28

13

Petition and Complaint

1 and undercut local policies and regulations which manage Santa Cruz County Health and
2 Human Services.

3

4 Syringe Outreach Supporters

5 34. In or about 2012, a group of volunteers called Syringe Outreach
6 Supporters ("SOS") was distributing needles out of a van in a residential neighborhood in
7 parking lot located on Bixby Street in the City of Santa Cruz, near the Santa Cruz
8 Beach Boardwalk. Neighbors were negatively impacted by dirty needles littering their
9 streets, as well as by increased drug activity and crime in the area. SOS did not offer
10 any client support services or otherwise attempt to get clients medical care or treatment.
11

12 The all-volunteer operations of the SOS were believed to be one of the major sources of
needle litter in the City of Santa Cruz.
13
35.
14 In or about December 2012, community opposition to the proliferation of

15 dirty needles being found in public spaces was heightened and extensively debated by a

16 cross-section of the community. As a result of public input and associated policy actions,

17 the City of Santa Cruz formed a Public Safety Citizen Task Force, which investigated and

18 issued a repart on its findings. The task force met over the course of nearly one year

19 land the task force work was informed by a variety of County executive Staff and key

20 community stakeholder presentations from health service providers and service

21 recipients.

22 Santa Cruz County HSA Takes Over
Countywide Needle Exchange Program
23
36.
24 On or about April 2013, concurrent with the implementation of local policy

25 actions between the City of Santa Cruz and County of Santa Cruz, the County SSP was

26 formed and assumed the oversight of the programs formally operated by the all-volunteer

27 SOS, which eventually dissolved. The County SSP established two fixed locations in the

28 County - one at the County's medical clinic located at 1070 Emeline Street within the
furisdiction of the City of Santa Cruz, and one located at 9 Crestview Terrace within the

14

Petition and Complaint

1 urisdiction of the City of Watsonville. The County SSP has a "1:1 exchange" policy,
2 which means that program participants are required to bring back dirty needles in order
3 to obtain new ones. This policy is intended to reduce the number of dirty needles

4 limproperly discarded in the County of Santa Cruz.

5 37. The City of Santa Cruz's Public Safety Citizen Task Force issued its final
6 report in December 2013. The Santa Cruz City Council and Santa Cruz County Board of
7 Supervisors unanimously accepted the report. With regard to the proliferation of needles
8 in public spaces and the County's Syringe Exchange Program, the Task Force
9 recommended that City staff and the City Council work with the County HSA and the
10

11 3rd/5th District Supervisors' Offices to ensure the public safety efficacy (harm reduction

12 of users and community affected by discarded syringes) of the County's Syringe Services

13 Program. The Task Force considered the highest priorities for further policy actions to

14 include: (a) Insist that the County Board of Supervisors address the community-wide

15 impacts of SEP on their work plan/agenda; (b) Ensure best practices are in place for SEP

16 to mitigate impacts to the City's public spaces and neighborhoods with the following

17 lactions: (1) Relocate the SEP to County-owned property located in a nonresidential area;

18 (2) Implement a syringe identification tagging program (e.g., color coding or serial

19 humber); (3) SSP Exchange to be on a true one-for-one basis with an actual physical

20 count of syringes being exchanged with no estimations allowed; and (4) It was

21 established that the City should prevent additional syringe exchange programs from
22 pperating or opening within the City limits through ongoing policy actions in collaboration
23 with the County of Santa Cruz. As a result of this policy deliberation and public process,
24 the County Health Services Agency assumed responsibility for syringe distribution in
25 Santa Cruz County. A true and correct copy of the December 2013 Public Safety Citizen
26 Task Force report is attached as Exhibit "A."

27 38. There is no shortage of clean syringes in Santa Cruz County. The
28 County SSP has continuously distributed significantly more syringes per capita than any

15

Petition and Complaint

1 nearby County. According to the 2019 County SSP 2019 Biennial Report, Santa Cruz

2 County's SSP distributed more than 593,000 syringes during the period of March 2018

3 through February 2019. According to the U.S. Census, Santa Cruz County's Population

4 is 273,213. As a comparison, Santa Clara County, with a County population of

5 1,927,852 (approximately seven times more populous than Santa Cruz County)
6 dispensed 438,783 needles during the period of July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019.
7 Monterey County, with a population of 434,061 County residents, distributes
8 appropriately 113,847 needles per year. Santa Cruz County's authorized SEP distributes
9 more needles per capita, than that of the combined programs which exist in Santa Clara
10 land Monterey Counties. True and correct copies of the SEP needle exchange statistics
11 for the above referenced counties are attached as Exhibit "B"
12
39. On June 27, 2017, the Santa Cruz County Grand Jury issued a report
13 labout the County HSA SEP program entitled, "Sharper Solutions: A Sticky Situation That
14

15 Won't Go Away." On or about August 22, 2017, the County Board of Supervisors and

16 the County HSA provided their responses to the Grand Jury Report. A true and correct

17 copy of the Grand Jury report and the required agency responses is attached as Exhibit

18 "C". The Grand Jury found, among other things, that a significant problem with used,

19 discarded needles continues to exist across Santa Cruz.

20 Unauthorized Activities of the
21 Harm Reduction Coalition of Santa Cruz County (HRCSCC)

22
40.
23 On or about March of 2018, the Harm Reduction Coalition of Santa Cruz

24 County ("HRCSCC") was formed. An April 5, 2018 Santa Cruz Sentinel article, reported

25 that, "(T)he group, forged during a March 19 community meeting, aims to bring together

26 health service providers, elected officials, law enforcement and community members to

27 advocate for continuing and improved public health policies and programs." Instead of

28 bringing together health service providers, elected officials, law enforcement and
community members, HRCSCC "volunteers" began exploiting a loophole in the County

16

Petition and Complaint

SSP's policies and procedures to obtain syringes from the County and pass them out as

2 "secondary" needle exchange program without any oversight or authorization.
3 Petitioners and Plaintiffs are informed and believe that HRCSCC volunteers enrolled as

4 "clients" of the Santa Cruz County HSA SSP to obtain needles and supplies for use by
5 their organization. Petitioners and Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the HRCSCC
6 refused to undertake the advocacy and effort required to obtain local authorization and
7 ktherefore operated without authorization.
8 41. On or about November 2018 through April 2019, the HRCSCC continued
9 to operate without authorization, through their volunteers, and offer unauthorized
10 services within the City of Santa Cruz and the County of Santa Cruz. As an example, the
11

12 HRCSCC distributed up to 600 needles per day at a homeless encampment which was
established adjacent to the San Lorenzo River in the City of Santa Cruz. The
13

14 unsanctioned encampment was located behind a private shopping center ("Gateway

15 Plaza") and located on land adjacent to a state highway. The HRCSCC's operations

16 resulted in a dramatic increase in used, discarded needles where they operated. As a

17 result of the increase of unauthorized services, the encampment grew in size and

18 became a public and private nuisance with significant health and human safety concerns.

19 42. In order to manage the encampment and proliferation of needle litter

20 therein, the County HSA, in collaboration with local officials, installed a large red sharps

21 heedle disposal kiosk mere steps away from camp residents. The HRCSCC's

22 unauthorized daily distribution of needles resulted in a significant amount of needle waste

23 at the site despite the presence of the needle disposal kiosk. News stories featured

24 photos of the improperly discarded needles in the encampment. Furthermore, business
25 owners and employees at Gateway Plaza businesses regularly found dirty needles in
26 and around their establishments.

27 43. During the time period of the HRCSCC's distribution of needles at the
28 Gateway Encampment, unexpectedly large amounts of needles began washing up on

17

Petition and Complaint

t Santa Cruz beaches from the San Lorenzo River. The Director of an environmental
2 group, Save Our Shores, noted "the exceptionally high number of needles we have found

3 on our local beaches this winter season." She further éxplained, "While the largest

4 volume of needles we've found have been in locations adjacent to the outflow of rivers
5 land creeks, we have also been finding needles on beaches where we have not typically
6 found them in past years. This suggests, in addition to the increased numbers we are
7 finding on beaches like Seabright where the San Lorenzo joins the Monterey Bay, some
8

9 heedles are being swept out into the open Bay before we are able to collect them and
then washing back ashore in another location." A true and correct copy of a
10 correspondence from Save Our Shores that was submitted to the CDPH in opposition to
11

12 the HRCSCC's first application is attached as Exhibit "D".

44.
13 On or about March 2019, the City of Santa Cruz attempted to vacate the

14 unsanctioned encampment and participated in a legal action in a case entitled 19-

15 081898-EJD. In that case, a variety of City Public Safety Staff and property owners

16 provided declarations that described the impact of the unsanctioned activities. Both

17 Santa Cruz City Police Department Chief Andy Mills and Santa Cruz City Fire

18 Department Chief Jason Hajduk noted the widespread presence of used needles at the

19 encampment. Chief Hajduk specifically found that there were many needles underneath

20 debris and junk, and that many needles had further migrated just below the surface of the

21 dirt. HRCSCC directly distributed needles to the unsanctioned encampment without

22 lauthorization. To mitigate the damage from discarded needles and other contaminants,
23 the top layer of soil had to be scraped, removed and graded with heavy equipment.
24 When the unsanctioned encampment was finally abated, on or about May 2019, City
25 workers retrieved more than 2,000 dirty needles that had been improperly discarded
26 adjacently to local waterways a and a public park.

2 HRCSCC'S First Application for CDPH Certification
and Continued Unauthorized Operations
3

4 45. On or about March 11, 2019, the HRCSCC submitted its first application
5 to request authorization by Respondent/Defendant CDPH to operate a state certified
6 syringe exchange program. In its first application, the HRCSCC requested to operate a
fixed and mobile service delivery operation that was estimated to annually serve 150
8 individuals and distribute approximately 100,000 to 150,000 needles. A true and correct

9 copy of the HRCSCC's March 11, 2019 Application ("The March 11, 2019 Application") is

10 attached as Exhibit "E".

11 46. The HRCSCC's March 11, 2019 Application provided inaccurate and
12 inconsistent information. These inconsistencies and inaccuracies included the following:

13 (a) Answering "no" to the question "Is there a neighborhood association

14 affiliated with the location(s) of your proposed SEP site(s)?" In fact, there are
15 numerous neighborhood associations for the Coral Street fixed location and across the
16 County.
17 (b) Claiming that the Harm Reduction Coalition had a fiscal sponsor,
18 when in fact there was no such agreement.
19 (c) Claiming that "Watsonville saw a significant overdose increase in
20

21 2018" in order to justify increased syringe distribution in that City. This claim was later

22 confirmed to be false by Watsonville Chief of Police David Honda.

23 (d) Including the Salvation Army's 214 Union Street, Watsonville CA

24 location as a distribution site. The Salvation Army never agreed to allow syringe

25 distribution at this site, nor would it ever allow syringe distribution at any of its sites.

26 (e) Including a location in a Pajaro, Monterey County without first

27 informing law enforcement and the health officer of that jurisdiction, in violation of

28 Health & Safety Code Section 121349.14. When Monterey County's First District

19

Petition and Complaint

1 Supervisor belatedly learned of the site inclusion, his staff attempted to contact the

2 HRCSCC's founder, but was unsuccessful.

3 47. News articles which appeared in the Santa Cruz Sentinel on May 18, 19,
4 21, 2019, reported the lack of public review in the processing of the application. It was
5 reported at the time that then Scotts Valley Mayor Dilles "looked at the rules online, and
6 this could be a local decision. This group (HRCSCC) has the option of applying either
7 through local jurisdictions, city councils or supervisors or to the state," Dilles said. "And
they chose to go to the state. And I think this should be more of a local discussion and
decision, so we have more local control." Rev. Herb Schmidt noted in one of the articles
10 that "(w)e do not have any way of knowing if what (she's) doing is helpful or not helpful....
11 but more important is that we get people into treatment. And that seems to me the big
12

13 problem here in our county." A true and correct copy of the May 18 and 19, 2019 Santa
Cruz Sentinel Articles is attached as Exhibit "F".
14
48.
15 On or about May 22, 2019, The HRCSCC withdrew its first application for

16 CDPH authorization amid widespread community opposition and due to the inaccuracies

17 on their application.

49.
18 Despite HRCSCC's application withdrawal, without local or state

19 authorization, the HRCSCC continued to distribute needles on Coral Street, located in

20 the Harvey West neighborhood of Santa Cruz. This continued unauthorized distribution

21 of syringes at this location has resulted in a significant rise in the number of needles

22 cleaned up by City workers in adjacent parks and open spaces. An open space known

23 as the "Pogonip" adjoins the Harvey West area. As an example, more than 1,200

24 needles were found in the Pogonip in the month of March 2020. Furthermore,

25 needles were found by City staff at Grant Street Park, along the River Levee, at Cowell

26 Beach and in Sycamore Grove. Petitioners/Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the

27 HRCSCC is doing needle "drops," as hundreds of unopened boxes and bags of

28 syringes have also been found at the Coral Street location. HRCSCC clients are also

20

Petition and Complaint 1

thereby able to transport and utilize syringes they receive in other locations such as at

2 adjacent parks, neighborhoods, beaches and open space without any contact with any
local health professional. True and accurate copies of Santa Cruz City worker Needle
Logs for the months of March, June, July, and August 2020, obtained via Public
Records Act Request, are attached as Exhibit "G".

50. On or about October 2, 2019, Santa Cruz City Mayor Martine Watkins
sent a letter to the County Board of Supervisors regarding the County's evaluation of
8 harm reduction programs, syringe exchange sites or the consideration of secondary

10 syringe exchanges. Mayor Watkins stated that the City "would expect the County to

11 have prior City approval before any such programs and/or services are located within the
City of Santa Cruz' jurisdiction."
12 A true and accurate copy of the aforementioned
correspondence is attached as Exhibit "H".
13
51.
14 On or about October 2019, without local or state authorization, the

15 HRCSCC also began distributing syringes on Felker Street, a mixed-residential street,

16 located in the City of Santa Cruz. As a result of the HRCSCC's unauthorized operations,

17 City staff were forced to increase maintenance of the area in the interest of the public's

18 health and safety. City worker logs reflect that in the months prior to the HRCSCC's

19 heedle distribution at Felker Street, no needles were found at that location. As soon as

20 the HRCSCC began distribution at that location, City workers began finding needles. A

21 City park known as the Grant Street Park adjoins the Ocean Street corridor and is within

22 walking distance of the Harvey West and Felker Street neighborhoods. A group known

23 as the Grant Park Neighbors Association has had long-standing communications with

24 Santa Cruz County and Santa Cruz City Officials regarding the environmental and social
25 impacts of the needle exchange program. A true and correct copy of correspondence

26 from the Grant Park Neighbors Association is attached as Exhibit "I".
27 Petitioner/Plaintiff Grant Park Neighborhood Association Advocates are the founders of
28 the group and issued said correspondence.

21

Petition and Complaint

1 52. On or about November 14, 2019, the County HSA held a public meeting
2 to solicit public opinion about the County's SSP and to make recommendations for the

3 County Board of Supervisors to make improvements to the County SSP at a scheduled a
4 December 10, 2019 meeting. The purpose of this meeting was to guide further
5 improvements to the County's SSP program.

6 HRCSCC'S Second Application for CDPH Certification and Continued
7 Unauthorized Operations

8 53. Petitioners and Plaintiffs are informed and believe that the HRCSCC has

9 never requested nor applied for a local permit from the County of Santa Cruz.
10 54. On or about November 20, 2019, the HRCSCC submitted a second
11 application to the CDPH requesting state certification to operate an authorized state
12 certified clean needle and syringe exchange program and services for a fixed location on
13 Coral Street in the City of Santa Cruz, and "mobile" services anywhere and anyplace in
14 the County of Santa Cruz. In their second application, the HRCSCC requested to
15 operate a mobile site operation that was estimated to serve 200 individuals and distribute
16 150,000 and 160,000 needles annually. A true and correct copy of HRCSCC's
17

18 November 20, 2019 application (the "November 20, 2019 Application") is attached hereto

19 as Exhibit "J" and incorporated herein by reference as if set forth fully herein.
55.
20 Needle distribution programs may be established pursuant to Health &

21 Safety Code Section 121349 and state regulations found at 17 CCR Section.7000 et seq.

22 Such programs may be initiated by the local government of a City or a County, and

23 approved by the CDPH and State Public Health Officer for a local agency to administer

24 (see H&S Section 121349(b)); in this matter neither the City of Santa Cruz nor the

25 County of Santa Cruz sought out or endorsed a local needle distribution program.

26 However, the CDPH may authorize a needle distribution program independently of local

27 control, through approval of an application by an "entity" that meets standards listed in

28 H&S Section 121349 and 17 CCR Section 7000.

22

Petition and Complaint

56. The HRCSCC's November 20, 2019 Application also provided inaccurate
2 and inconsistent information. These inconsistencies and inaccuracies included the
3 following:

4 (a) Claiming again that there are no neighborhood associations
5 affiliated with the Proposed SEP sites, when in fact, there are numerous neighborhood
6 associations in each of the incorporated Cities of Santa Cruz County and in the
Unincorporated County;
8 (b) Claiming again that "Watsonville saw a significant overdose increase
9 in 2018" in order to justify increased syringe distribution in that City. This claim was
10 again confirmed to be inaccurate by Watsonville Police Chief Honda;
11 (c) Claiming that the southern portion of the county receives fewer
12

13 services than the rest of the county due to limited hours at the Watsonville campus of

14 the County Syringe Services Program (SSP). However, in November 2019, the County

15 Board of Supervisors authorized an increase in the hours of operation at the County

16 SSP Watsonville Campus as well as the Santa Cruz campus;

17 (d) Claiming that it had worked "in collaboration" with the County SSP,

18 which the County has since denied.

19 57. HRCSCC's November 20, 2019 Application requests to operate a needle

20 and syringe distribution program sanctioned for "mobile" outreach and delivery. Mobile

21 butreach services were requested for a site a on Coral Street, located between Limekiln

22 Street and River Street, in the City of Santa Cruz. This is essentially a fixed location

23 within the City of Santa Cruz located on public property and public right of way. Mobile

24 delivery services were also requested to be available anywhere throughout the entire
25 County. Petitioners/Plaintiffs are informed and believed that the CDPH has never
26 previously authorized any group to have such broad geographical authorization for
27 needle distribution. The mobile delivery locations are anticipated to include repeated
28 Jocations that do not comport with local planning regulations. Petitioner/Plaintiff is

23

Petition and Complaint

1 informed and believes that the November 20, 2019 Application will provide fixed services
2 at distribution locations throughout the incorporated cities and unincorporated County of
3 Santa Cruz.

4 58. The short summary of the HRCSCC's November 20, 2019 Application

5 lacknowledges that it seeks to a operate a Syringe Exchange Program (SEP), and that the

6 program will largely be a mobile delivery service with regularly occurring operations in the
7 City a of Santa Cruz and a mobile service within the incorporated Cities and
8 Unincorporated County of Santa Cruz. However, Petitioners/ Plaintiffs are informed and
9 believe that HRCSCC's mobile delivery services will largely take place at the same
10 Jocation/s. Petitioners/Plaintiffs are further informed and believe that the November 20,
11 2019 Application was drafted with CDPH guidance to attempt to avoid required
12
environmental review of its desired operations.
13
59.
14 Petitioners/Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that the

15 HRCSCC's mobile outreach operations in the City of Santa Cruz will for all intents and

16 burposes be at a fixed location near or adjacent to a "recreational" park. Furthermore,

17 Petitioners/Plaintiffs are informed and believe and thereon allege that the mobile delivery

18 services will occur anywhere throughout the entire County of Santa Cruz, except within

19 any "recreational" park. The authorization does not prohibit distribution of needles next

20 to, or directly outside of parks, nor does it prohibit distribution near schools or in open

21 spaces. The County of Santa Cruz has more than fourteen (14) state parks and

22 beaches. The City of Santa Cruz has more than twenty-five (25) parks. The City of

23 Watsonville has more than twenty-five (25) parks. Our parks are critical environmental
24 and cultural resources to our community. HRCSCC's all-volunteer operations pose
25 significant harm to the health and safety of Santa Cruz County residents. The

26 HRCSCC's November 20, 2019 Application, and as later CDPH authorized, was and is
27 physically, logistically and practically incapable of satisfying the requirements for
28 recovery of all of the anticipated 160,000 needles that HRCSCC requests to annually

24

Petition and Complaint

1

1 distribute, leaving only the inevitable consequence of thousands of used needles littered
2 across the incorporated Cities and the unincorporated neighborhoods of Santa Cruz
3 County.

4 60. The HRCSCC's November 20, 2019 Application indicates a single contact
5 person identified as Denise Elerick, who is also identified as the SEP Administrator, with
6 the Title of Coordinator. The "Applicant Organization Description" is referenced in
Attachment I of the Application and simply described as follows: "The Harm Reduction
8 Coalition of Santa Cruz County (HRCSCC) is a volunteer-run community organization
serving people who use drugs in Santa Cruz County and thereby improving the health of
10 the entire community." Simply, "HRCSCC" or "Harm Reduction Coalition of Santa Cruz
11

12 County" is a name to describe a collection of individuals who volunteer their time, as

13 each individual may choose, who collectively have no "membership" and may change

14 depending on who shows up to volunteer, with no organization or formal legal entity

15 separate and apart from the actions by the individuals themselves on their own.
61.
16 Health and Safety Code Section 121349 states that authorization to

17 conduct a program is to be given to an "entity." It is the "entity" that is responsible for

18 compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements. Merriam Webster dictionary

19 defines "entity" as "an organization that has an identity separate from those of its

20 members." HRCSCC does not have such an identity separate from those of its

21 members. Notwithstanding its seeming good intentions, HRCSCC was not statutorily

22 authorized to receive approval from CDPH for a needle distribution program.

23 62. Although the purported mobile needle and syringe exchange program will
24 physically occur within the boundaries of County of Santa Cruz, the HRCSCC's "mobile"
25 butreach program in the City of Santa Cruz will regularly operate in the Harvey West
26 Neighborhood, and thus that neighborhood and adjacent neighborhoods will be
27 disproportionately impacted by the program. The mobile outreach services will operate
28 in close proximity to the City of Santa Cruz's Harvey West Park, a park which serves

25

Petition and Complaint

1 humerous youth recreational organizations, Santa Cruz's Pogonip Park Open Space and
2 Grant Street Park, a neighborhood City park that is adjacent to the Ocean Street corridor
3 in the City of Santa Cruz.

4 63. As a practical matter, there are no boundaries restricting HRCSCC's

5 mobile outreach or home delivery operations. There is nothing preventing individuals

6 from securing new needles at Coral Street and continuing down Coral Street or Limekiln
7 Street down to Harvey West Blvd. toward Harvey West Park to use those needles to
8 inject drugs. There, educational facilities, serving elementary, middle school, and high
9 school aged children, are located adjacent to the park. There are also no boundaries
10 restricting HRCSCC home delivery operations which are intended to provide services
11
county wide; anywhere, anyplace, except in a "recreational" park. There is nothing
12

13 preventing individuals from securing hundreds of new needles countywide, at a delivery

14 location, which can occur anywhere, at or adjacent to a "recreational park" or other

15 environmentally sensitive property or neighborhood.

64.
16 The Coral Street fixed location is immediately adjacent to the only family

17 homeless shelter in the County of Santa Cruz, The Rebele Family Homeless Service

18 Center. The Coral Street location is also near City and County youth recreational and

19 leducational serving facilities. The Coral Street fixed location is also less than a 10-minute

20 walk to "The Cottage," an afternoon County high school educational program, and "Kirby

21 School," an independent school serving sixth through twelfth grade students. The City of

22 Santa Cruz Parks and Recreation Department operates Harvey West Park, which is
23 ppen to the public daily from 7:00 a.m. - Sunset and provides adult and youth serving
24 recreation classes and serves countless countywide nonprofit youth sports organizations,
25 including Little League baseball.

26 65. The location of the mobile delivery services is approved to operate
27 lanywhere, anyplace county-wide except in a "recreational park." There is no local

Petition and Complaint

1 oversight of the HRCSCC program to prevent HRCSCC from violating local land use
2 regulations or to be accountable to local officials.

3 66. The County of Santa Cruz's locally approved SEP is managed by County

4 personnel staff, at County facilities in the incorporated Cities of Santa Cruz and

5 Watsonville. These facilities are managed under County regulations and oversight. Over

6 the past six years the County has made investments in its SEP program and expanded
7 its services after public outreach and environmental analysis. The County has worked to
8 mitigate the impacts of their operations on surrounding neighborhoods. The CDPH and
9 HRCSCC circumvent local decision making and the ability to enforce local rules and
10 regulations.
11 Impacts of Proposed Project Excluded from
12 Consultation & Administrative Process.

13 67. On or about November 20, 2019, upon deeming the application
14 provisionally appropriate and, as required by California Health and Safety Code §
15 121349(e), CDPH opened a ninety-day public comment period, which officially ended on
16 January 20, 2020.
17 68. Pursuant Health and Safety Code § 121349(c), the CDPH must consult
18

19 with "local law enforcement leadership..." during the review process. As a precursor to
action on an application, H&S Section 121349 requires that the CDPH "shall balance the
20

21 concerns of law enforcement with the public health benefits" [Section 121349(d)].

22 Further, 17 CRC Section 7004 provides standards for denial of an application and states

23 that "The department shall reject an application if: (c) Evidence of projected harm to

24 bublic safety presented by local law enforcement officials(s), is, in the department's

25 judgement greater than evidence of projected benefits to public health."

26 69. During the public comment period, the law enforcement heads of the

27 County of Santa Cruz and the cities located within the County unanimously submitted

28 letters of opposition. Each law enforcement department head drafted written concerns
about the HRCSCC Application and submitted their opposition to the proposed HRCSCC

27

Petition and Complaint

1 project. These letters listed and highlighted certain facts and numerous concerns

2 regarding the potential public safety, environmental impacts and health effects of the
3 applicant's project operation. These concerns were informed by HRCSCC's ongoing

4 bperation of an unsanctioned needle and syringe exchange program in the County of
5 Santa Cruz. These concerns were also directly related to the very operation and design
6 of the HRCSCC's requested needle and syringe exchange program and in relation to the
7 statutory and regulatory scheme for CDPH authorization. In light of the existing Santa
8 Cruz County SEP, the available administrative record does not contain any
9

10 counterbalancing evidence of benefits to public health from a needle distribution program

11 which would allow the CDPH and the Public Health Officer to approve the HRCSCC

12 lapplication without a clear and substantial abuse of their discretion.

70.
13 Emails to and from the CDPH obtained through Public Records Act

14 it requests make it clear that approval was a foregone conclusion and there was no

15 weighing of public opinion or that of law enforcement. Apparently, the CDPH did not

16 want to encourage public comment or review of the application. The CDPH only

17 discussed and pushed for positive news stories, with no discussion of negative media

18 coverage, including news footage showing the numerous discarded needles left behind

19 at the Gateway Encampment. The HSA invited the CDPH to a public meeting to a hear

20 about needle distribution in Santa Cruz County, but the CDPH refused to attend, citing

21 "the intensity" of opposition to the HRCSCC application. The County HSA and law

22 enforcement heads emailed the CDPH regarding their concerns about the drastic

23 reduction of clients seen at the HSA by medical professionals. The CDPH failed to
24 respond to these concerns. True and correct copies of the aforementioned emails are

25 attached as Exhibit "K".

26 71. On or about December 10, 2019, the County of Santa Cruz received an
27 lagenda report (Agenda Item #17) from the County HSA with recommendations for a
28 policy that provided direction to manage secondary exchanges effective January 2020.

12 Santa Cruz County Sheriff/Coroner Jim Hart participated in the

13 administrative review of the HRCSCC November 20, 2019 application, and submitted a

14 correspondence dated January 7, 2020, on behalf of the County of Santa Cruz, and the

15 County's approximately 273,000 residents of the unincorporated county, and the

16 approximately 131,567 residents of the incorporated Cities of the County (Capitola,

17 Scotts Valley, Watsonville and Santa Cruz). The letter raised several specific concerns

18 regarding a "secondary program,' with little to no oversight and no services other than

19 handing out syringes." He stated, "Approving the HRC's application will negatively impact

20 public safety by putting our community members at risk from exposure to even more

21 syringe litter." A true and correct copy of the January 7, 2020 correspondence is

22 lattached hereto as Exhibit "N" and incorporated herein by reference as if set forth fully

24 74. The City of Scotts Valley participated in the administrative process by
25 submission of a letter of opposition dated January 17, 2020, by its then Mayor Randy
26 Johnson, and the full City Council. A true and correct copy of that correspondence is
27 attached hereto as Exhibit "O" and incorporated herein by reference as if set forth fully
28 herein.

29

Petition and Complaint

75. Watsonville Police Chief David Honda participated in the administrative

2 process by submitting a January 14, 2020 correspondence, on behalf of the City of

3 Watsonville. The letter raised several specific concerns about the HRCSCC application
and the impact of the mobile delivery services throughout the entire County. Chief Honda
5 hoted that the "applicant indicates that there are no neighborhood associations affiliated

6 with the proposed SEP sites. However, the SEP proposed home delivery services
7 throughout the entire county. In Watsonville there are countless neighborhood
8 Jassociations (Bay Village, Pajaro Village, Portola Heights and Pajaro Vista to name a
9 few) which should be consulted. The applicant's proposal is open ended and seeks to
10 bperate an all-volunteer mobile exchange purportedly anywhere, any place without any
11

12 support or outreach by local neighborhood associations." A true and correct copy of that

13 January 14, 2020 correspondence is attached hereto as Exhibit "P" and incorporated
herein by reference as if set forth fully herein.

15 City of Capitola Police Chief Terry McManus participated in the

16 administrative review process with his email correspondence dated December 23, 2019.

17 The communication raised several concerns regarding the HRCSCC's operations and

18 stated "(d)espite the lack of proper certification and huge opposition, the operators of the

19 Harm Reduction Coalition of Santa Cruz County deliberately obtained thousands of

20 syringes from the County and distributed them at various locations in the City of Santa

21 Cruz and perhaps other municipalities without authorization. •This group's operation has

22 resulted in a drastic decrease of clients utilizing the County's Syringe Services Program,

23 meaning that there are fewer addicts receiving medical attention and exposure to critical
24 rehabilitation opportunities." A true and correct copy of the December 23, 2019
25 communication is attached hereto as Exhibit "Q" and incorporated herein by reference
26 as if set forth fully herein.

27 77. The City of Santa Cruz Police Chief Andy Mills participated in the
28 administrative process with his email dated December 11, 2019. The email also raised

30

Petition and Complaint

1 several concerns regarding the HRCSCC's operations and stated, "I cannot support a
2 heedle exchange expansion without local oversight and accountability; a plan to reduce
3 discarded needles, and ensuring the effectiveness of reducing infection rates and drug
4 bverdoses . ..' A true and correct copy of the communication is attached hereto as
5 Exhibit "R" and incorporated herein by reference if as if set forth fully herein.
6 78. The State has treated these letters by local law enforcement as nothing
more than a "public comment" . they were given the same weight as a single concerned
8

9 citizen. Consequently, the residents of the County of Santa Cruz, and the residents of
the incorporated Cities of Capitola, Watsonville, Scotts Valley and Santa Cruz have been
10 frozen out of the administrative process. Thousands of additional communications were
11

12 sent to the CDPH in opposition to this program. The CDPH has trivialized the

13 environmental and social impacts of the hypodermic needle litter on County of Santa
Cruz residents.
14
79.
15 The requirement that "local law enforcement" be consulted is intended to

16 provide a voice to communities impacted by a needle exchange program. The statute is

17 of little value if as here, if the weight of every law enforcement agency in the County and

18 incorporated Cities is dismissed.

19 Non-Compliant Environmental Review

20 80: The CDPH created and prepared a form commonly known as an

21 'Environmental Checklist Form" in relation to the HRCSCC's November 20, 2019

22 Application. The completed "Environmental Checklist Form" was not provided to the

23 public for review prior to the CDPH's authorization of the HRCSCC's application. The
24 'Environmental Checklist Form" was only made available on or about September 1,
25 2020, after a Public Records Act request revealed its existence.

26 81. The "Environmental Checklist Form" is dated January 24, 2020, and
27 electronically signed by CDPH employee Alessandra Ross. Ms. Ross is believed to work
28 as an Injection Drug Use Specialist for the CDPH. Petitioners/Plaintiffs are informed

31

Petition and Complaint

and believe that no actual review under the California Environmental Quality Act ever
2 took place. Instead, Respondents summarily checked off boxes on the aforementioned
3 Environmental Checklist Form" and falsely described the surrounding area around the
HRCSCC's Coral Street location as only "dedicated to industry with some businesses"
5 land having "no parks or residential properties present." in fact, there are multiple
6 businesses open to the public, numerous residential properties, a vast City park, Little
7 League fields, a school, a historically and culturally significant cemetery, and dedicated
8 ppen spaces, all of which have been impacted by improperly discarded drug needles.
9 Most important, the needle distribution takes place just outside the County's only family
10 shelter, where children and their families make their home. A true and correct copy of
11 the CDPH's "Environmental Checklist Form" is attached as Exhibit "S".
12
82.
13 On the "Environmental Checklist Form," Respondents did not check off a

14 single box under "Environmental Factors Potentially Affected." This includes "Aesthetics"

15 and "Hazards or Hazardous Materials." Dirty needles are obviously hazardous, and

16 bbviously unsightly.

83.
17 On the "Environmental Checklist Form" Respondents answered no, when

18 asked if thére would be a "direct or reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in

19 the environment." This is despite the HRCSCC's documented track record of leaving

20 significant amounts of needle waste behind wherever they operate. On the

21 *Environmental Checklist Form" Respondents further characterized the needle.

22 distribution as a "temporary land use" while simultaneously stating that the HRCSCC had

23 been operating at the location on a permanent basis for eighteen (18) months as part of

24 the HRCSCC's work with the Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency's Syringe
25 Services program.

26 84. On the "Environmental Checklist Form" Respondents failed to make
27 l'Mandatory Findings of Significance." Included in this category are environmental
28 Impacts that are individually limited but "cumulatively considerable." The incremental

32

Petition and Complaint

1 effects of a project are "considerable when reviewed in connection with the effects of
2 past projects, the effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable future

3 projects." Respondents checked the "no" box, despite the serious environmental effects
4 that the HRCSCC caused to the soil at the Gateway encampment location, at the San
5 Lorenzo River, and at local beaches.

6 85. On the "Environmental Checklist Form" Respondents denied that the
7 HRCSCC's project will have any "substantial adverse effects on human beings - either
8 directly or indirectly." On the "Environmental Checklist Form" Respondents also denied
9 that the HRCSCC project would impact fire protection, police protection, parks, or other
10

11 public facilities. Public facilities include Santa Cruz City sidewalks and streets.

86.
12 Public comment was received on the application, and Respondents

13 were obliged to consider the voluminous quantity of letters, emails, and comments in

14 opposition to the application and environmental impacts. Attached as Exhibit "T" are

15 copies of 19 of the public comment letters as a random sampling of the many concerns

16 expressed. Recurring themes in the public comments were: the danger to the

17 environment, the danger to young children, the danger to public safety by permitting a

18 needle distribution program without any local accountability, the proximity of the

19 proposed location adjacent to the County's only family shelter; the proximity of the

20 heedle distribution program to parks, schools and locations frequented by children and

21 the incompatibility of the program with the residential neighborhoods and environment;

22 the lack of coordination with trained medical providers which has led to a reduction in

23 services administered by the County HSA; the pollution of our rivers, streams, beaches,

24 land other public spaces. In addition, letters from over a thousand residents were

25 submitted in opposition to the program.

26 87. Notwithstanding the opposition to the application, and the application's
27 Ifailure to meet statutory and regulatory requirements, on August 7, 2020 (nearly 200
28 days after the close of the public comment period and 170 days beyond the 30-day

33

Petition and Complaint

deadline), less than 48 hours before the former CDPH Director resigned, Respondents
2 CDPH and the Public Health Officer approved the application by the HRCSCC with minor
3 revisions which purportedly restrict the HRCSCC's volunteers geographical limits from

4 bperating in a "recreational park." Otherwise, the scope of its services includes the

5 lentirety of the County of Santa Cruz with no other restrictions.

6

7 The HRCSCC's Competing Operations Undermine the County's Existing
8 Program

9 88. The HRCSCC's competing program is inferior to and undermines the
10 County's existing Syringe Services Program. The HRCSCC is not made up of medical
it 11 professionals, nor does it provide essential wraparound services to its clients; the
12 HRCSCC is essentially an amorphous assemblage of unnamed individual volunteers
13 with an unspecified structure. In contrast, the County's Syringe Services Program falls
14 under the auspices of the County's Public Health Division of the County Health Services
15 Agency. It is housed in the County's medical clinic located on Emeline Street in the City
16 of Santa Cruz, as well as another location in the City of Watsonville. The SSP is run with
17 the oversight of the Santa Cruz County's Director of Nursing, with the help of public
18 health nurses. The County has designed and implemented a Drug Medi-Cal Organized
19
Delivery System which has significantly expanded treatment capacity in the County. The
20

21 County's Syringe Program, not the HRCSCC, is in the best position to be able to connect

22 injection drug users with treatment, including the County's Medication Assisted

23 Treatment Program ("MAT").

89.
24 Unfortunately, the HRCSCC's operations have resulted in a drastic

25 transition of SSP clientele away from the county-administered SSP program, thereby

26 depriving addicts of the opportunity to receive medical treatment, HIV/Hepatitis testing,

27 and rehabilitation referrals from trained professionais and under the oversight of the

28 County Health and Human Services Agency. For comparison, there were 387 unique
ID's (clients) at the County SSP in September 2017, 157 in September 2018 (after the

34

Petition and Complaint

1 HRCSCC began its operations), 148 in September 2019 and just 104 in September
2 2020. Indeed, a unanimous Board of Supervisors wrote in its opposition to the

3 HRCSCC's application (Exhibit "M" to this Petition and Complaint): "If the State approves

4 the Harm Reduction Coalition's application, there will likely be worse outcomes for
5 injection drug users as they are directed away from the County SSP (as has been

6 documented) and toward an entity that doesn't have strong treatment connections, and
7 isn't run by professionals. If the application is approved, it will harm our community, and
8 would further jeopardize the effectiveness of the County's SSP. What would be best for
9 linjection drug users and best for the larger community (not to mention the environment)
10 would be to support the County's professionally-run SSP which has the ability to change
11 lives for the better and to deny HRCSCC's application which would draw clients to an
12

13 linferior service, potentially putting them in danger. Injection drug users and our larger

14 community deserve better." (Emphasis added.). True and correct copies of the Santa

15 Cruz County Syringe Services Characteristics of Clients data sheets for September

16 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 are attached as Exhibit "U".
90.
17 The HRCSCC's operations also make it more difficult for the County of

18 Santa Cruz to expand and improve upon the County program. On or about May 2019,

19 the Santa Cruz County Second District Supervisor, wrote an email opposing the

20 HRCSCC's application to establish an SEP in Santa Cruz County. The Supervisor

21 wrote: "(I)n this climate the County is unable to engage in any sort of dialogue regarding

22 ways in which the current program can be improved while this application is being

23 considered for approval. Additionally, should the program be approved, it's clear that the
24 current County program will be difficult to separate from this independent program by the
25 greater community. Any resultant lack of transparency, increase in needle waste, public
26 health impacts or other impacts will reflect back upon the County program. have
27 concerns that any attempts to improve upon the current County program will be nearly
28 impossible to implement in that context - and understandably so." A true and accurate

35

Petition and Complaint

copy of Santa Cruz County's Second District Supervisor's May 23, 2019 email is
2 attached as Exhibit "v".

3 91. The County has also recently formed a new SSP Advisory Committee,

4 which meets monthly and makes recommendations regarding the County syringe

5 program. The HRCSCC has no such transparency or local oversight.

6 HRCSCC'S "Secondary" Distribution Practices and Lack of Data Collection
7 92. While the number of clients seen at the SSP decreased with the

8 HRCSCC's inception, the number of syringes dispensed by the SSP actually increased.
9 This is because the HRCSCC was obtaining syringes from the SSP for "secondary"
10 distribution. "Primary" visits are those in which a client is seen at the clinic and obtains
11 syringes only for him or herself. At a primary visit to the SSP, the client can be directly
12 lassessed by medical professionals. "Secondary" visits are those in which syringes are
13

14 obtained for others who are not present at the visit. Because these secondary users are

15 hot present at the "secondary" visit, they cannot be directly assessed, nor can data be

16 collected regarding them. Primary visits at the SSP have dropped dramatically since the

17 HRCSCC began its operations. There were 196 primary visits at the County Syringe

18 Services Program in September 2017. In September 2018 (after the HRCSCC began its

19 unauthorized operations) that number went down to 103. In September 2019 there were

20 lust 47 primary visits, and only 39 in September 2020.

21 93. The County Board of Supervisors has since placed a cap on the number

22 of syringes that can be distributed for secondary exchange from the SSP. The HRCSCC

23 has no such limit on secondary distribution, and secondary distribution is a major part of

24 their program. Because secondary users are not seen by the HRCSCC, it is impossible
25 for the HRCSCC to obtain any data on these users.

26 Public Benefit - Attorneys Fees & Costs

27 94. This action is brought by Petitioners not just in their private capacities but
28 also in the public interest, to vindicate important public rights. The relief sought by

36

Petition and Complaint

1 Petitioners would be impossible to measure fully in money damages such that there is no
2 economic benefit to Petitioners to justify the cost of litigation for purely economic return.
3 This litigation will confer a significant benefit on the general public and a large class of

4 persons who otherwise would suffer the ill effects from the environmental degradation

5 land nuisance impacts of the actions of Respondents/Real Parties/Defendants. Upon
6 successful conclusion of this legal proceeding, Petitioners will request a full award of
7 attorneys' fees and costs on the "private attorney general statute" of CCP §1021.5, or
8 lany other such grounds as the law supports and the court deems appropriate.

11 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
12 VIOLATION OF CEQA
13 (Against All Respondents and against HRCSCC and Denise Elerick as Real

14 Parties in Interest)

15 95. Petitioners incorporate by reference all the allegations contained in the
16 preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

17 96. Under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA" - Public
18 Resources Code §S 21000, et seq.), the State Respondents CDPH and Acting Public
19 Health Officer (State Respondents) functioned as the Lead Agency in decision-making as
20 to prescribed environmental review of the approval of the needle distribution program
21 memorialized by the August 7, 2020 Authorization letter. The applicant HRCSCC and
22 Denise Elerick stand in the position of a Real Party in Interest in respect to this challenge

23 based on CEQA. A true and correct copy of the August 7, 2020, Authorization Letter is
24 attached hereto as Exhibit "W".

25 97. Petitioners are informed and believe that State Respondents have
26 violated CEQA and have failed to proceed in the manner as required by law, committed a
27 brejudicial abuse of discretion and acted arbitrarily and capriciously in authorizing the
28

37

Petition and Complaint

HRCSCC application because the discretionary approval by CDPH of the application was
2 hot subjected to any environmental review as required by CEQA.

3 98. The Authorization Letter from the California Department of Public Health

4 dated August 7, 2020 was approved despite extensive evidence in the record and
5 otherwise put before the State Respondents of significant and substantial adverse
6 impacts to the environment that would and later did result from approval of the needle
7 distribution program, but those potential foreseeable and actual impacts were not
8 laddressed by CEQA environmental review. Such reviews are in order to address the
concerns conveyed during the CDPH/OA consultation with local law enforcement and
10 received during the public comment period regarding litter. Although CDPH/OA did not
11 lauthorize syringe services to operate within any recreational parks located in the City of
12

13 Santa Cruz or Santa Cruz County, there has been no analysis of the impacts of services

14 adjacent to parks where HRCSCC's operations occur. Additionally, CDPH states it will

15 provide HRCSCC with a grant to address syringe litter in Santa Cruz County and will

16 require the HRCSCC to conduct syringe litter clean up, among other activities, at a

17 minimum weekly. However, there is no analysis as to the extent of the financial and

18 environmental cost to support the authorized program and to prevent syringe litter.

19 99. The HRCSCC operations have resulted in syringe litter, which creates

20 environmental impacts to public health and safety that have not been addressed through

21 ICEQA environmental review. Such impacts include, but are not limited to, used syringes
22 being littered near schools where children walk, along recreational trails utilized by
23 lfamilies, in parks utilized by families, in libraries frequented by children, in restrooms, in
24 parking lots and garages, and in other public buildings and public places, along public
25 rights-of-way, loose in trash, and within conduits of waste which result in syringes being
26 found in creeks, streams, rivers, and outlets to the ocean, including beaches near those
27 putlets. These impacts result in exposure of innocent persons, including children, to
28 experiencing a needle stick which could result in the contracting of communicable

38

Petition and Complaint

diseases such as Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, or HIV. The syringe litter also results in
2 potential adverse impacts to the water quality in the creeks, streams, rivers and beaches
3 of the County of Santa Cruz, City of Santa Cruz, City of Capitola, City of Scotts Valley

4 and the City of Watsonville.

5 100. Furthermore, needle litter results in adverse impacts to the recreational
6 use and environmental degradation of the creeks, streams, rivers and beaches of Santa
7 Cruz and Santa Cruz County. The needle litter in commercial and business areas of
8 Santa Cruz results in economic "blight" because patrons and customers of businesses
9 will avoid unhealthy, unsafe business areas where needle litter is present.
10
101. Within the City of Santa Cruz there are special planning zones subject to
11

12 detailed local planning and land use ordinances. The CDPH authorization of the

13 HRCSCC to operate a needle exchange program, is in conflict with local land use

14 ordinances, with actual adverse impacts due to the hindrance in implementing those

15 prdinances and plans. All these impacts have not been analyzed or considered by

16 Respondents for their effects on the environment as required by CEQA.
102.
17 Petitioners/Plaintiffs are informed and believe, and thereon allege, as

18 follows: That at the time Respondent CDPH authorized the HRCSCC's needle

19 distribution program on August 7, 2020, it was the policy and practice of CDPH to ignore

20 or decline to engage in any kind of CEQA review for approval of SEP programs such as .

21 this one.. That CDPH admits that it did not begin to consider CEQA review of SEP
22 approvals until November of 2019 - before the approval of the HRCSCC program. On or

23 about November 2019, the CDPH began the process of preparing a "preliminary
24 checklist." CDPH provided an email response to an inquiry from municipal law attorney
25 Conor Harkins (no connection to this matter) as to whether CDPH has evaluated the
26 applicability of CEQA to SEP Approvals, with the reply that:

27 "For SEPs approved by the California Department of Public Health

28 since November 2019, the Department does a preliminary checklist to assess whether CEQA applies and also if any CEQA exemptions

39

Petition and Complaint

1 apply. The Department does not publish a notice of exemption or

2 notice of determination."

3 A true and correct copy of the aforementioned email is attached and a copy of a the

4 standard "preliminary checklist" that CDPH began to use in November 2019 is attached.

5 hereto as hereto as Exhibit X".

6 103. Said "preliminary checklist" was never used for the review of the earlier
7 March 11, 2019 HRCSCC application. The commencement of CEQA preliminary review
8 in November 2019 was not coincidental but rather was a protective administrative policy
9 decision in reaction to an October 28, 2019 court ruling adverse to CDPH in County of
10 Orange v. California Department of Public Health, No. 37-2019-00039176-CU-MC-CTL-
11 Superior Court for the County of San Diego. In that case, the CDPH lost a motion for
12 summary adjudication requiring CDPH to engage in CEQA review for a SEP program
13 (based on the environmental impacts of needle litter) in Orange County, CA. A true and
14 correct copy of the aforementioned "Notice of Ruling" on Motion for Summary
15 Adjudication hereto attached as Exhibit "Y". The CDPH "ENVIRONMENTAL
16

17 CHECKLIST" (Exhibit "S" attached hereto) prepared in this matter and obtained from
the files of CDPH, was formulated in bad faith without any factual or legal support, and
18

19 calculated to provide a predetermined but false "excuse" for CDPH to refuse to engage in
lany actual CEQA review whatsoever.
20
104.
21 The purported "ENVIRONMENTAL CHECKLIST" prepared in this matter

22 lists the name of the Syringe Services Program as "Right on Point." To
Plaintiffs/Petitioners knowledge there is no such thing as "Right on Point" and HRSCC 23

24 does not have any legally registered use of that fictitious name, much less use of that

25 hame by common usage; the name "Right on Point" does not appear in the CDPH SEP

26 lapplication by HRCSCC, or anywhere else. The "ENVIRONMENTAL CHECKLIST"

27 prepared in this matter next lists the "Lead Agency" as HRCSCC. Plaintiffs are informed

28 and believe that "Right on Point" was inserted in the "ENVIRONMENTAL CHECKLIST"
las part of the improper document, so that it would not be obvious that ostensible CEQA

40

Petition and Complaint

T review by the "Lead Agency" (HRCSCC) is not a review of a different or separate
2 prganization, but rather a false review of itself under an illusory/false name. The improper
3 'ENVIRONMENTAL CHECKLIST" is a false, a fraud on the public, and the document

4 together with any and all of its findings, determinations, and conclusions has no legal
5 force or effect under CEQA.

6 105. The entry of "Harm Reduction Coalition of Santa Cruz County
‹HRCSCC)" on the "ENVIRONMENTAL CHECKLIST" prepared in this matter as the
8 "Lead Agency" (followed by the HRCSCC contact information for the Lead Agency) is
false and unlawful in violation of Public Resources Code §21067, which states in its
10 entirety:
11 "Lead agency" means the public agency which has the principal responsibility for 12
carrying out or approving a project which may have a significant effect upon the 13
environment.
14
HRCSCC is not now and never has been a "public agency." And the public agency 15

16 with responsibility for approving the SEP program was and is CDPH. By law CDPH

17 would be the "Lead Agency" responsible for filling out the "ENVIRONMENTAL

18 CHECKLIST" prepared in this action (see CEQA Guidelines 14 CCR §15000 et seq.,

19 Appendix G) - which is the critical first step in determining whether any further CEQA

20 review will occur. As shown on the face of this document, HRCSCC unlawfully acted as

21 the Lead Agency to review itself and its own project, then made a fallacious

22 determination that the discretionary decision on its own SEP program is not a "project"

23 under CEQA due to false findings of "no impact," and a groundless assertion that it

24 came under an inapplicable exemption, so that no environmental review would be

25 required.

26 106. The "ENVIRONMENTAL CHECKLIST" prepared in this action is signed
27 (digitally) on p.2 by Alessandra Ross, a CDPH official working in the State's SEP
28 pversight program. Plaintiffs/Petitioners are informed and believe, and thereon allege,

41

Petition and Complaint

1 that: Following the CEQA litigation loss in the Orange County matter CDPH adopted an
2 internal policy that new SEP program files must be documented with at least the
3 appearance of CEQA initial review. To satisfy this internal policy the CDPH official signed
4 the unlawful and defective false "ENVIRONMENTAL CHECKLIST", and placed it in the
5 CDPH file on the HRCSCC program. The execution and placement in government files of
6 the false "ENVIRONMENTAL CHECKLIST" was done without regard to the illegality of
7 the public document, or the false information in the public document, or the harm that
8 might be caused to members of the public that might be misled to believe that
9 environmental review had been initiated by CDPH.
10 107. Respondent/Defendant CDPH is vested with discretion in its approval of
11 the HRCSCC needle distribution program, and the CDPH decision to approve this
12

13 program was a "project" under CEQA as an activity which may cause either a direct

14 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect change in the

15 environment. Petitioners/Plaintiffs further allege that had Respondent CDPH conducted

16 CEQA review it would have found substantial evidence and more than a fair argument of

17 significant environmental a impacts as a consequence of the HRCSCC project.

18 Respondent CDPH would therefore require an environmental impact report before going

19 forward with approval of the needle distribution program. Respondents' failure to engage

20 in environmental review under CEQA was unlawful, arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of

21 discretion, which should be corrected by a judgement and writ of mandate as prayed for

22 herein.

23 108. Notice of the Petitioners intention to file this Petition and Complaint will be
24 served on the State Respondents on December 7, 2020. A true and correct copy of the
25 hotice is attached hereto as Exhibit "Z", A copy of this pleading shall be furnished to the
26 Attorney General of the State of California in accordance with Public Resources Code §
27 21167.7.

1 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

2 PUBLIC NUISANCE
(Against All Defendants and Respondents)
3

4 109. Petitioners incorporate by reference all the allegations contained in the
5 preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

6 110. The operation and design of a needle distribution program that creates
7 the injurious, hazardous, noxious, and harmful impacts as described at lengthy herein is
8 in violation of Civil Code § 3479 and §3480. §

111. Petitioners have, as alleged herein, suffered special injury as a
10 consequence of the public nuisance, and have exhausted their administrative remedies

11 where required to do so.

12 112. The injurious actions of Respondents which create the nuisance
13 complained of herein are not authorized by statute but rather are in violation of a statute
14 or in excess of any authorization by statute, such as Respondents' failure to provide for
15 the safe recovery and disposal of used syringes and sharps waste from all program
16 participants - in violation of Health and Safety Code § 121349(d)(3).
17 113. Unless and until the nuisance created by Defendants and Respondents is
18 enjoined, the safety, health and well-being of the public, as well as the special and direct
19 injury to Petitioners, will suffer irreparable damage for which money damages would be
20
an inadequate remedy.
21
114. Defendants and Respondents must be compelled to perform the acts and
22

23 refrain from the acts requested in the prayer for relief below and incorporated by

24 reference, as Petitioners have no other adequate remedy at law.

Petition and Complaint

1 THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

2 WRIT OF MANDATE:
VIOLATION OF LOCAL ORDINANCES (CCP § 1085)
3 (Against All Defendants and Respondents)

4 115. Petitioners incorporate by reference all the allegations contained in the
5 preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.
6 116. 17 CCR Section 70004 of the Code of Regulations requires that CDPH to
7 reject an application if, among other things, information submitted in the application is
8 lincorrect or incomplete. 17 CCR Section 7002 requires a signed statement that the
9 applicant will comply with local ordinances, but to Petitioner's knowledge no such
10 statement is in the record and the application was fatally incomplete.
11 117. 17 CCR Section 7014 explicitly requires that the program shall be
12

13 pperated in compliance with local ordinances. The program as submitted for
consideration in the application could not be operated in compliance with the local land
14 use ordinances that make up the Local Coastal Land Use Plan, San Lorenzo Urban
15

16 River Plan, the Local Coastal Implementation Program, the Pogonip Master Plan, and

17 City's General Plan. In fact, following the approval of the needle distribution program the

18 program was and is operated in conflict with the local ordinances creating those Plans

19 which do not permit, either as a use by right or by discretionary permit, the operation of a

20 heedle distribution program.

21 118. In regards to the HRCSCC November 20, 2019 application, the needle

22 distribution service area is designated as the entire City of Santa Cruz, and the entire

23 Santa Cruz County, where there currently is no general plan designation or land use

24 zone where needle distribution would be permissible as a use by right or by grant of a
25 discretionary permit. Pursuant to 17 CCR Section 7014 neither the City of Santa Cruz or
26 the County of Santa Cruz is legally required to accommodate needle distribution as a
27 land use that is in conflict with the ordinances establishing the general plan and land use
28 zoning laws of the City.

44

Petition and Complaint

1 119. Further in regard to the HRCSCC November 20, 2019 application, the
2 needle distribution program which purports to distribute needles throughout the entire

3 City of Santa Cruz is in direct violation of Santa Cruz Municipal Code Section: 24.08.10
4 and 24.08.200.

5 120. The HRCSCC's operations conflict with state and federal Clean Water

6 Acts because they cause dirty needles to end up in our waterways. They also interfere
7 with coastal access rights under the California Coastal Act of 1976 because citizens are
8 unable to fully utilize the beaches due to dirty needles on the beaches.
9 121. The actions and decisions of Defendants/Respondents to approve the
10 HRCSCC application were arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion and contrary to
11 law. Further, the continued operation of the HRCSCC needle distribution program by
12 Defendants is in conflict with local ordinances and is an ongoing and continuing violation
13
of law.
14
122.
15 Petitioners/Plaintiffs have exhausted their administrative remedies where

16 required to do so.

123.
17 Unless and until the Defendants/Respondents are enjoined, the safety,

18 health and well-being of Plaintiffs/Petitioners and the public will suffer irreparable

19 damage for which money damages would be an inadequate remedy.

20 124. Defendants and Respondents must be compelled to perform the acts and

21° refrain from the acts requested in the prayer for relief below and incorporated by

22 reference, as Petitioners have no other adequate remedy at law.

24 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
WRIT OF MANDATE
25 VIOLATION - PROGRAM APPROVAL FOR NON-"ENTITY"

26 (Against All Defendants/Respondents)

27 125. Petitioners/Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all the allegations contained

28 in the preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

45

Petition and Complaint

1 126. 17 CCR Section 7004 of the Code of Regulations requires CDPH to reject

2 an application if, among other things, information submitted in the application is incorrect

3 or incomplete or contrary to the requirements of H&S Section 121349.

4 127. H&S Section 121349 unequivocally requires that approval of an

5 application and program authorization is available only to an "entity." HRCSCC is merely
6 a shape shifting collection of volunteers, with no separate and distinct status as an
7 "entity" from its volunteers.
8 128. The application, pursuant to 17 CCR Section 7004, failed as incomplete,
9

10 because there is no indication of any "entity" status other than its desire to operate as a
*volunteer-run community organization." A group of volunteers does not establish
11• l'entity" status pursuant to relevant Health and Safety regulations.
12
129.
13 The application violated H&S Section 121349 for failing to provide an

14 "entity" as the legally required application and operator of a program.

130.
15 The actions and decisions of Respondents to approve the HRCSCC

16 lapplication were arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion and contrary to law.

17 Further, the continued operation of the HRCSCC needle distribution program is an

18 ongoing and continuing violation of law.

19 131. Petitioners/Plaintiffs have exhausted their administrative remedies where

20 required to do so.

21 132. Unless and until the Defendants and Respondents are enjoined, the
22 safety, health and well-being of the public will suffer irreparable damage for which money
23 damages would be an inadequate remedy.

24 133. Defendants and Respondents must be compelled to perform the acts and
25 refrain from the acts requested in the prayer for relief below and incorporated by
26 reference, as Petitioners have no other adequate remedy at law.

Petition and Complaint

1 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

2 WRIT OF MANDATE:
DUTY TO REJECT APPLICATION DUE TO INCORRECT INFORMATION AND
3 FAILURE TO MEET H&S CODE REQUIREMENTS

4 (Against All Defendants/Respondents)

5 134. Petitioners/Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all the allegations contained

6 in the preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

135. Title 17, section 7004, of the Code of Regulations requires CDPH to
8 reject an application if, among other things, information submitted in the application is
incorrect or incomplete, or if the applicant does not meet the requirements listed in
10 Health and Safety Code section 121349.

11 136. The HRCSCC's application to CDPH contained incorrect and incomplete
12 information in several areas, including but not limited to: a false claim that no
13 neighborhood associations exist for the areas of distribution, a false claim of
14 *collaboration" with the County Syringe Services Program, and a false claim about
15 increased overdoses in Watsonville.

16 137. Moreover, the HRCSCC's application failed to meet requirements set
17 forth in Health and Safety Code section 121349 et seq. Specifically, HRCSCC's
18 application was entirely devoid of any evidence or information as to how it would improve
19 its operation and eliminate any concern that the threats to public health and safety that
20 occurred at the Gateway Encampment, Coral Street site, and Felker Street site would not
21 occur with the new certification to operate the mobile program all across the County.
22 138. The HRCCC's program also conflicts with and undermines the existing
23 County Syringe Services Program, with the potential to cause the SSP to fail completely.
24 Health and Safety Code Section 121349 authorizes a city OR a county OR a city and
25 county, OR the state to authorize a syringe program. The Health and Safety Code does
26
not allow for competing programs to be authorized by two different governmental entities
27
in the same jurisdiction.
28

47

Petition and Complaint

1 139. The HRCSCC's application is devoid of any evidence or information as to
it 2 how it will actually provide the wraparound services enumerated in Health and Safety
3 Code section 121349 et seq., including Drug abuse treatment services, HIV or hepatitis
4 screening, Hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination, Screening for sexually transmitted
5 infections, Housing services for the homeless, for victims of domestic violence, or other

6 similar housing services, and Services related to provision of education and materials for
7 the reduction of sexual risk behaviors, including, but not limited to, the distribution of
8 condoms.
9 140. Furthermore, the HRCSCC's broad "secondary distribution" practices
10 completely bypass the reporting requirements in Health and Safety Code Section
11

12 121349(d)(4), which requires that it prove that the entity has the capacity, and an

13 established plan, to collect evaluative data in order to assess program impact, including,

14 but not limited to, all of the following: The total number of persons served, and the total

15 humber of syringes and needles distributed, recovered, and disposed of, and the total

16 humbers and types of referrals to drug treatment and other services. Because the

17 HRCSCC is not interacting with these "secondary" recipients directly, it is in fact

18 impossible for it to obtain the required data.

19 141. Further, title 17, section 7002(c) of the Code of Regulations also imposes

20 a mandatory and non-discretionary duty upon CDPH, requiring it to reject an application

21 unless it, among other requirements, requirements, "[p]rovides for the safe recovery and
22 disposal of used syringes and sharps waste from all its participants." HRCSCC's
23 application failed to outline how it would avoid another repeat of the soil destruction and
24 thousands of dirty needles recovered at the Gateway Encampment.

25 142. State Respondents therefore had a non-discretionary and mandatory duty
26 •to reject HRCSCC's application, and their failure to comply with their duties under the law
27 has resulted in the unlawful authorization of the HRCSCC's operation of the needle

28

48

Petition and Complaint

1 exchange program, posing an immediate threat to the public health and safety of the
2 citizens of the City and County of Santa Cruz.

3 143. Finally, authorization of a syringe exchange program can only be made

4 after consultation with local law enforcement leadership. (Health & Saf. Code, §

5 121349(c).) All of the evidence submitted to CDPH relating to public health and safety

6 concerns about the HRCSCC's operations in the City and County of Santa Cruz
7 demonstrate that the harm to public safety exceeds any public health benefit of the
8 HRCSCC' s operation across the County. The CDPH has refused and/or failed to
9 adequately consult with the law enforcement of Santa Cruz County, instead summarily
10 dismissing law enforcement's concerns and opposition.
11
144. Petitioners have no plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary
12
course of law.
13
SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION
14 DECLARATORY RELIEF AND INJUNCTION

15 (Against all Defendants/Respondents)

16 145. Petitioners/Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all the allegations contained
17 in the preceding paragraphs as though fully set forth herein.

18 146. An actual controversy exists between the parties. Petitioners contend that
19 State Respondents have authorized HRCSCC to operate a needle exchange program a
20 without meeting the necessary legal requirements of CEQA and the fundamental
21 requirement of H&S 121349 and 17 CRC 7000 et seq.: that the operation of the needle
22 distribution program is a public nuisance; that the operation of the needle program.

23 violates local ordinances and therefore violates 17 CRC 7014; that the approval and
24 continuing operation of the needle distribution program by an amorphous collection of
25 individual volunteers does not meet the legal requirements for a responsible "entity" and
26 therefore is invalid; that the CDPH has a ministerial duty to reject the HRCSCC's
27 erroneous application; and that the invalid approval of the needle distribution program

49

Petition and Complaint

1 and its continuing operation causes ongoing irreparable harm to Petitioners that must be
2 enjoined. Respondents and Defendants dispute these contentions.

3 147. Based upon the foregoing, a clear, actual and present controversy has
4 arisen between Petitioners/Plaintiffs, State Respondents, Respondent HRCSCC and
5 Respondent HRCSCC Applicant and Coordinator Denise Elerick, which controversy
6 cannot be resolved without a judicial determination.
7 148. Accordingly, Petitioners/Plaintiffs seek a judicial determination of the
respective rights, duties and obligations of the parties.
WHEREFORE Petitioners/Plaintiffs pray for judgment against Defendants
10 and Respondents as follows:
11
1. That this court issue alternative and peremptory writs of mandate
12

13 commanding State Respondents to reject the application of HRCSCC to operate a

14 mobile needle exchange outreach program in the City of Santa Cruz;

2.
15 That this court issue alternative and peremptory writs of mandate

16 commanding State Respondents to reject, rescind, invalidate and to set aside the

17 authorization and approval given to the HRCSCC to operate a needle distribution a

18 program in the County of Santa Cruz;

3.
19 That this court issue alternative and peremptory writs of mandate

20 commanding State Respondents to reject the application of HRCSCC to operate a

21 mobile delivery program in the incorporated Cities of Scotts Valley, Capitola, Santa

22 Cruz and Watsonville.

23 4. That this court issue alternative and peremptory writs of mandate
24 commanding State Respondents to prepare, circulate and consider appropriate
25 environmental documentation to comply with CEQA;

26 5. a That this court issue a preliminary and permanent injunction enjoining all

27 Respondents and Defendants, their agents, servants, employees, and representatives

28 and all persons acting under the control, in concert with, or participating with

5 and all persons action under the control, in concert with, volunteering to act, ör

6 participating with Respondents and Defendants, from taking any action in furtherance
7 of the disputed needle distribution program that could result in a change or alteration of
8 the physical environment until Respondents and Defendants have taken actions that
are necessary to bring the needle distribution program into compliance with CEQA;
10 7. That this court issue an order declaring that the approval and subsequent
11

12 operation of the needle distribution program by Respondents and Defendants

13 constitutes a public nuisance and a threat to public safety because there is inadequate

14 control and recovery of the discarded hypodermic needle litter resulting from the

program:
15
8.
16 That this Court issue an Order declaring that the State Defendants'

17 authorization of HRCSCC to operate a needle a distribution program in the County of

19 inadequate control and recovery of contaminated medical waste;

20 9. That this court issue an Order declaring that the State Defendants'

21 authorization of HRCSCC to operate a needle distribution program in the City of Santa

22 Cruz and mobile delivery needle exchange program in the County of Santa Cruz is

Dear Mayor Bryant and City Council Members:
On behalf of the 14 members of the Publiò Safety Citizen Task Fotce; I am pleased to transmit our Report: Research, Findings and Recommendations: Santa Cruz City Public Sufety Citizen Task Force, This report serves as the culmination of the six-month process and addresses the charge of the Task Force as stipulated by the April 9, 2013 City.Council Agenda Report on the subject.
The Task Force committed to exploring the underlying safety issues impacting our community fromn a factual basis, and to developing recommendations to bring to City Council for thoughtful consideration. Despite our different backgrounds, porspectives and life experiences, we worked cohesively as group to learn about the pressing safety issues, to engage a wide array of experts in the fields of public safety and health, and to listen to community-membets.
Tögether we lcarned that Santa Cruz faces a host of complox publio safety challonges, and that our local governments (City and County) and social service providers need to collaborate to address them effectively. Many of the conversations were quite difficult given the sensitive nature of the Jopics and the Task Force was not in full agreement on cach and dvery recommendation. Howeyer, we remained committed to the process, put our personal opinions to the side, analyzed the Issues over four months and worked for the last two months to develop feasible recommendations for your roview. The recommondations reflect a principled compromise of Task Force members, but not a compromise of our prinoiples. We stand behind this serious work and are deeply appreciative of the time, energy and thought that Santa Cruz County Treasure-Fred Keeley, City of Santa. Cruz staff Susie O'Hara and Scott Collins, and the expert paänelists added to the process.
Santa Cruz can address these difficult issues; now is our opportunity, is We urge the City Council and City staff to review the report and determine how best to oporationalize the recommendations. We undorstand that the City will need time to assess each recommendation and work with its partners to make them a reality, That being said, we ask that the City Council conduct a 6-month and 12-month check-in with the community to measure progress made on these recommendations:
Thaok you all for your continued work to make Santa Cruz a safer place to live, work and play.

Sincerely,
ML Kris Reyös

Executive Summary SANTA CRUZ

Introduction

Santa Cruz is a community of limitless beauty and opportunity. Towering redwood forests and verdant coastal grasslands dominate the hillside landscape. Pristine beaches and world-class surf breaks bring Monterey Bay and Pacific tides to the edge of the forest, This exträordinary community is tucked in between the sea and the mountains,
Cradled by this exceptional natural environment, Santa Cruz enjoys opportunities not usually found mn small rural areas. The community is home to a University of Callfornia campus. Students and university jobs bolster the local economy, Research and entrepreneurship are sliared values of faculty and local residents, oftentimes leading to remarkable innovation.
Santa Cruz liosts visitors from around the world and its tourism industry is the economic bedrock of the town: Tourists are drawn to Santa Cruz for its recréation, seaside amusement park, bustling downtown, and endless beaches. Art, culture, sustainable agriculture and locally sourced food and drink connect community members and visitors alike in museums, along Downtown streets, on farms and vineyards, and around local restaurant tables,
The community fabric is woven with these threads of beauty and opportunity, People lucky the benefits of this vibrant community. enough to live and spend time in Santa Cruz reap However, the fabric of Santa Cruz also contains-different and troubling threads that impact our
community.
The small geographical space between the mountaing and the sea is also home to metropolis- level crime and complex societal issues. Santa Crüz property and violent crime rates rival or surpass even those of innet-city California communities." Drug addiction is rampant and fuels high property crime rates and a public health crisis around carelessly discarded hypodermic syringes in public spaces: Alcohol spurs violence in the Downtown entertainment district. Like other Central Coast cities, gang culture exists and impacts the livès of countless at-risk youth.and young men of all ethnicities. Youth violence is sparked by gang rivalries, at times ending in homicides. When compared with other cities in California, the city of Santa Cruz has one of the highest per capita rates of homelessness. Many Santa Cruz homeless suffer from crippling addiction and/or mental illness, symptoms of which may result in public nuisance and criminal
behaviors.

Large metropolitan cities manage the myriad of public safety issues within their much larger geographic boundaries utilizing substantial budget resources, a broader tax base, health servides and all-encompassing criminal justice systems. Further, some metropolitan cities and countjes are bundled under one combined government agency, ensuring common public safety goals are achieved through better management of resources and cost-savings.'
12012 Crime rates: Califórnía Metropolitan Statistical Area (violent crime raie: 424/100,000 inhabitants, pröperty crine rale: 2767/100,000 inhabitants); Compton (violent crime rate: 1242/100,000 inhabitants; prpperty orime rate: 2447/100,000 inhábitanis); San José (violent crime rate: 363/100,000 inhabitants, property crime rate: 2914/100,000 inhäbitants); Santa Crüz (violent crime rate: 711/100,000 inhabitants, property crime rate: 5887/100.000 inhabitants) An example of a bundled city/county management structure is the City/County of San Francisco.

D3l PUBLIC SAFETY CITIZEN TASK FORCE
SANTA CRUZ Executive Summary

In contrast, Santa Cruz must tackle thiese same issues with a lean police force, budget and tax base within a high density geographical space. The City's public safety goals have not historically been prioritized by the County even though the City hosts County Heath, the Main Jail, the Superior Court, and ts the County seat. Lack of inter-agency collaboration and coordination as well as a unified City/County vision is partly to blame for the City's public safety chällenges.

Community discourse over Santa Cruz's public safety challenges has evolved over the years.
There is widespread support for the funding programs that improve public safety by treating addiction, providing affordable housing, and reducing poverty, However, views on tolerance, which has. long been an overarching value of the community, have changed. Many now believe
tolerance without accountability is a cause of the City's current safety concerns, especially. around drug addiction, related crime, and public health concerns. Recent community discusstons are focused on balancing tolerance and compassion with accountability.
Responding to this recent community discourse, and on the heels of a seties of horrific events, the Santa Cruz City Council elected to form a Public Safety Citizen Task Force to grapple-with the "deep-rooted issues affecting our public safety." 15 members" were selected and given six months to arrive at a set of policy recommendations capable of improving public safety conditions in the City. Although a colossal task, Tusk Force members rose to the challenge, bringing open minds and hearts, a common purpose and respect for each other and the precess. After six months of education and heated deliberation, several high-priority recommendations were idenfified that coalesce atound the following topics.

Prevention

Discarded hypodermic syringes in the City's opcn spaces, beaches and residential neighborhoods pose a significant public health problem. The Task Force finds that the County has not properly açcounted for and mitigated the unintended consequences of locating a Syringe Services Program (SSP) within a residential neighborhood and the geographical boundaries of the City of Santa Cruz. Discarded hypodermic syringes in public and privatsly-owned spuces must be significantly reduced : Until this public safety crisis is rectified, the Task Force strongly recommends that the County Board of Supervisors consider the management of SSP as a top priority and relocate SSP to a non-residential area.
Current prevention programs for drug addictión and gang involvement are under-serying the community. Additionally, the City's open spaces are not designed and utilized effectively to reduce crime opportunities. The Task Force strongly belleves that to reduce criminal conduct and recidiyism within its boundaries, the City must re-evaluate its priorities regarding public safety to
focus more ón drug treatment funding and efficacy to reduce criminal recidivism, support at-risk youth after-school programming, and enhance environmental design and pro-social.activation of the City's most erime-ridden open spaces, business districts, and parks,

One member resigned leaving a yoting membership öf 14 during deliberations on tecommendations.

PUBLIC SAFETY CITIZEN TASK FORCE SANDICHZ Executive Summary

Stmtegic Police Enfoxcement

The Santa Cruz Police Department (SCPD) is understaffed and is thus unable to focus on
community policing, directed enforcement, and/or enforcement of low-level crimes and nuisance behaviors io the City's open spaces, gateways and other geographical focal points. This leads to disorder and high erime rates in the City's most beloved areas, The Task Force has identified two
critical SCPD priorities. The Task Force recommends the City take immediate measures to staff the SCPD at budgeted levels, and move towards a long-term goal of building police force-on par with national per capita levels. The Task Force also recommends implementing a targeted policing model that emplasizes enforcement of nuisance crimes in natural, city entry and focal point áreas.

Strategic Code Enforcement

Santa Cruz is burdened with a high number of high-risk alcohol outlets' and residential indoor and outdoor marijuand grow operations for medical and recreational purposes. High-risk alcohol outlets contribute to alcohol-fueled violence and crime, Growing, cultivation and processing of marijuana in residential heighborhoods is a serious public safety concern, a code enforcement issue, and often involves secondary criminal activity. The Task Force therefore recommends. regulatory reform of the City's high-risk alçohol ouflets and medical marljuana grows.
Offender Assistance with Accountability/Recidiyism Reduction
Repeat offenders are an ongoing challenge to the City. A relatively small number of individuals are responsible for an excessive number of arrests and citations.' A new collaborative management model, in partnership with the City's rögional partners in Health Services, non-. profits, and oriminal justice system, is needed to reduce the impact of repeat offenders on the community. The Task Force recommends a specialty court model for veterans, substance abusers, mentally ill and/or homeless offenders. The specialty court is a proven model in halting the revolving door of recidivism by linking offenders to freatment and rigorous judicial monitoring, Specialty courts are highly collaborative, bringing together the criminal justice system and service providers to enforce court-ordered sanctions. The Task Force finds that the specialty
court model would provide offenders with the right balance of treatment assistance with:
accountability.

Criminat Justice Accountability
The Task Force finds that the Santa Cruz County Courts have failed the community with regards to criminal sentencing. Improved accountability should come in the form of increased

PUBLIC SAFETY CITIZEN TASK FORCE
SANTA CRUZ. Executive Summary

transparency, consistent adjudication of the City's municipal code violations, and implementation
of a specialty court model (as noted above).
The Task Force recommends the following measures be implemented by the Santa Cruz County Superior Court:
• Court to issue a misdemeanor warrant to individuals following threé failures to appear in a six-month period. This automatic worrant issuance will eliminate the need for the City: Attorney to prosecute repeat municipal code infraction offenders who fail to appear.
8 Compel the Presiding Judge of the Santa Cruz County Superior Court to appear before the Santa Cruz City Council twice a year to share what the Court Is doing to address high repeat offender rates in the City of Santa Cruz and receive input from the City Council and City Attorney.
Collaborative Accountability and Appropriate Funding
The Task Force strongly recommends that the City communicate with each jurisdiction named in the report and ask that it be responsive, in writing, to the recommendations that impact their operations. Further, the Task Force recommends the City Council and County Board of Supervisors consider an alternätive fünding mechanism to support any Task Force
recommendations that are outside of the City and County's regular budget.

Conclusion

Santa Cruz's public safety problems are complex, but can be solved. Multiple factors including substance abuse, tolerance without accountability, and lack of inter-agency collaborative strategies among the City, County and Court system have led to a serious public safety problem within the City. Fourteen City residents took on the challenge of identifying solutions through cducation, collaboration, and respeçtful dialogue, a trend that will hopefully spread to others throughout the rest of the County. The outcome of the Task Force process is a set of policy recommendations capable of far-reaching influence and a community united behind positive change. Change will only happen with the full commitment of the City, County, criminal justice system, social service nonprofits, and residents to move together towards a common goal of improved public safety for all.

SANTACRUZ Introduction and Background

Introduction

Background

Set on the idyllic central coast of California, Santa Cruz, a small city of 62,000 residents, has grappled historically with a difficult dichotomy. Santa Cruz is both a tight-knit community with strong preservationist values, and an isolated city that depends on outsiders to sustain its economy. These seemingly paradoxical qualities of protection and openness have long been the overarching management principles of Santa Cruz government and politics. This dichotomy is also lacge part of Santa Cruz's publio image.
As far back as the late 19th century, local leaders communicated the Santa Cruz image and fifestyle to would-be migrants and tourists. Public safety and the efficacy of the police force was a hot topic in one 1896 publication, Santa Cruz County, a Faithful Reproduction in Print and Photography of its Climate, Capabilities and Beduties, whose aim was to promote Santa Cruz and "to attract the attention of people in other parts of the country,
The orderliness and sobriety of Santa Cruz is one of its best features. I know of no
place in the United States which can surpass its admirable record, I doubt if thère is one of the same size which can cqual lt. The three officers whose pictures
appear on this page constitute the entire night and day police force of this city of nine thousand inhabitants, and they are found amply sufficient to police it. The few arrests are due wholly to the almost totat lack of drunkenness and crime.
Setting aside the unavoidable Influx of pickpockets and petty thieves which comes upon such occasions as the great Water Carnival week, along with the thousands who then throng the city, the record of the police docket is practically cloan all the year round. in the two years falling under the writer's: observation no man has drawn a pistol,

Not only is a woman perfectly safe from danger of harm, but she is perfectly certain of immunity from anything bordering on insult. I dwell on these facts not because they excite any comment here, where they are taken as matters of course, but because they will help to eradicate from the Bastern reador's mind the absurd and
unjust notion that the far West is "wild and woolly"
Over a century later, each of the public safety themes noted in the 1896 publication: disorder, substance abuse, petty crime, and violence, are at the forefront of Santa Cruz community discourse. Butthe tone has changed dramatically. Rather thän a story of a pristine and "safe"

SANTAÇRUZ Introduction and Background

environment meant to attract newcomers, contemporary perception is that "outsiders" are responsible for an unsafe environment for Santa Cruz residents. Öf course, it is questionable that the 1896 characterization of public safety in Santa Cruz was entirely genuine, nor is it the case that the current public safety challenges are the sole responsibility of a transitory population.
Nevertheless, over the last five years community concern around public safety has reached a critical mass, with many residents calling into question supposed community tolerance and apathy towards illegal activity. During this period, multiple violent events jolted the community, each seemingly more senseless than the previous. In addition, persistent quality-of-life crimes, a large unsheltered homeless population, perceived disorder, and lack of pro-social opportunities in public spaces, coupled with these acts of violence, tipped the scale for many in Santa Cruz, leading to calls for more protection and security,
Much of the current community unease began with the 2009 and 2010 murders of Santa Cruz teenagers Tyler Tenorio and Carl Reimer. Both murders were gang-related and galvanized a
number of robust and vocal community groups into action.
Following 2011, year in which Santa Cruz County saw 14 homicides, the months between May 7, 2012 and February 28, 2013 could onfy be described as a perfect storm of criminal activity in Santa Cruz. On May 7th local shop owner Shannon Collins was brutally murdered at midday by a mentally-ill homeless man who had recently been released from prison due to a clerical error and who had been an overnight client of the Homeless Services Center (HSC). Her death sparked debate over the management of the HSC and the local effects of Assembly Bill 109 (AB109).°
In August of the same year, 12-year old Joey Mendoza was gunned down in a gang-related drive-by shooting on his way home from football practice. His death opened up festering wounds from the 2009 and 2010 deaths of Tenorio and Reimer and prompted new community conversations regarding the prevalence of gangs and youth violence,
Ini November of 2012, a combination of heightened property crime and media attention around drug dens above Cowell Beach and illegally discarded hypodermic syringes found across town catulyzed community debate over the potential role of Syringe Exchange in perpetuating drug addiction, environmental and health hazards and neighborhood crime.
The fallout over discarded syringes lasted för several weeks with no resolution to the debate. Shortly thereafter, on February 9, 2013, 32 year-old Pauly Silva was shot and killed outside of a Downtown bar and eatery. His murder began a cycle lasting 17 days, in which Santa Cruz experienced no less than four acts of violent crime.' The last event of that tragic cycle brought

PUBLIC SAFETY CITIZEN TASK FORCE

SANTA CRUZ Introduction and Background

the community to its knees, On February 26, Sergeant Lorän "Butch" Baker and Detective Elizabeth Butier were murdered by a recent transplant with a criminal history., Their deaths ignited a firestorm of community speculation around the reputed "draw" of criminals to Santa Cruz, ánd renewed debate over the legitimacy of the "Keep Santa Cruz Weird" motto.
The narrative of the previous several months of violence, property crime and discarded hypodermic syringes forced the community to question the consequences of tolerance for drug abuse and illegal activity, and ultimately the dichotomy of protection and openness. The nature of the crimes and their perpetrators contributed to a perception about the "draw" of mentally ill, <rüg-addicted, or gang-affiliated outsiders to Santa Cruz and raised questions about how the criminal justice system is managing this supposed segment of the population.
But even as the comtnunity wrestled with such difficult questions, in the weeks following the officer shootings, Santa Cruz came together to memorialize the fallen officers and found new energy for collaboration. An important opportunity arose to address the community's most difficult public safety questions. In that spirit of collaboration, the plan for the Public Safety Citizen Task Force crystallized,
Formation of the Public Safety Citizen Task Force
The concept of the Public Safety Citizen Task Force was born out of a series of public meetings, commencing with the December 2012 City Council Public Safety Committee. At that meeting, the Commitice directed City staff to return in January with "recommendations to address the public safety concerns in the City's parks, beaches, open space, neighborhoods, and commercial areas.d The Committee was particularly Interested in developing a forum for community input and discussion, as public meétings did not proyide sufficient time and space for dialogue and
exploration of public safety concerns.
Staff researched other city models and best practices for community collaboration on public safety issucs. This research resulted in a recominendation to asseible a citizen task force. Diversity of residential geogräphy, social networks, professions, gender, and age were noted to be critically important to the composition of the proposed group. A broad citizen demographic would bring unique, unfiltered, and oftentimes unheard perspectives from everyday life. in Santa Cruz. The Public Safety Committee adopted staff's Task Force recommendation at its January 29th meeting. The City Council followed suit on February 12th
Several weeks after the February tragedies, and fortified by a community unified in its call for positive change, the City Council established the scope and charge of the Task Force and confirmed the Mayor's selection of participants.

PUBLIC SAFETY CITIZEN TASK FORCE

SANTACRUZ Introduction und Background

As noted in the Coûncil Agenda Report, "the charge of the Task Force is to clearly define the underlying safety issues facing the City of Santa Cruz and present their findings and recommended solutions to the City Counoil, utilizing quantitative and qualitative evidence and best practice research to support that work. The Task Force will be tasked with exploring the deep-rooted issucs affecting our public safety, including, but not limited co: drug abuse and treatment; drug-related crimes; transients; inappropriate social behaviors; mental iliness: gang activity: and the impacts (increased calls for service have on our local justice.system}. These complex issues require deep thought and analysis, and most importantly, open minds and plenty of room for disagreement and collaboration. Ultimately, the Task Force will develop a report on these issues and provide recommendations [for] short-term and long-term actions to City Council to include programmatic, budgetary, and policy-oriented solutions.'
The following City of Santa Cruz residents were appointed to serve on the Task Force as they provided a "well-balanced representation of the community, including members from public safety (past and present), local non-profits, schools, university and community groups:"9

Introduction

The Task Force initiated their work on May 7, 2013 and focused the first set of meetings on establishing decorum, governance structure, work plan and educational priorities. By request of Mayor Hilary Bryant, Santa Cruz County Treasurer, Fred Keeley, provided guidance to the Task Force at their flrst meeting, understanding that the 15 members were heading into uncharted territory. Treasurer Keeley offered the following important advice:

. The Task Force should determine rules of engagement early in the process, by consensus. Meeting decorum and governance structure are fundamental components of the procèss.
Conventional wisdom about issaes and policy are not always the truth; therefore Task Force members should come into the process tyith an open mind. Given the diversity of opinion around the issues, the overarching goal of the Tusk Force should be tò "manage principled compromise where no one compromises their principles." Principles are very different from ideas, opinions or notions,
Treasurer Kecley further recommended that the Task Force work plan include four components: study, analysis, solutions and recommendations. He likened the course of study to an "expanding and contracting universe." The Task Force would spend the yast majority of its time in the expanding phase, collecting data, hearing from experts, and broadening its perspectives. Then, in the contracting phase, the Task Force could use that information to assemble thoughtful, well- grounded aud succinct recommendations, capable of far-reaching impacts. Finally, he suggested that the recommendations be measurable, adjustable and efficient and be operationalized by the City, County, neighborhoods and/or voters.
Leading up to the inaugural meeting, Task Force members were asked to provide their personal perspectives on the major safety issues facing the City. They identified the following list of critical issues, generally in descending order of community impact (by number of individual Task Force members identifying that issue):

Violence
Property/neighborhood crime Gangs/Gäng activities Drug addiction.
Alcohol addiction
Mental health issues
Homelessness
Homeless Service Center "enabling" Large number of unstable people, in business district Transients/transient activities

Läck of sense of safety
Pollution of beaches
Insufficient public safety resources in City Budget
Illegal camping Siphoning of police and fire resources to social problems Perceived highi crime rates

The collective list of issues includes both causes and effects and many, if not all, are intrinsically related. In general, most critical issues fall into one of five categories, listed in order of causation: human. conditions/afflictions, structural/systemic issues, behvlors and/or activities affecting public/community space, victimization, and public perception.
Equipped with these working priorities and Treasurer Keeley's recommendations, the Task Force elected a Chair and Vice Chair, Kris Reyes and Jim Howes respectively, developed a tentative schedule, and reached consensus on three-meeting work plan, Heeding advice about keeping an open mind on the issues, the Task Force decided to use its list öf critical issues as baseline, but set educational priorities only after hearing the perspectives and experiences of the general püblic and the City's department staff. After the inaugural meeting, the next three meetings consisted of the following program:

Prioritization of Critical Issues/Themes of Study
The Task Force spent significant time distilling the wide range of issues identified down to the priorities it could reasonably address over their 6-month tenure. In establishing the prilority list, the Task Force was mindful of incorporating the issues identified as most critical by the public, those issues that were creating signifioant hardship on City departments, and, in turn, issues that fell outside of the Çity's management jurisdiction but nonetheless negatively impacted our community. With those variables in mind, the May 29h and June 12t4 meetings focused on establishing those parameters and receiving the perspectives of both the City and the community.

City Perspectives
The City's jurisdiction over quality of life and public safety is limited to is five distinct categories: municipal infrastructure, natural and waste management; emergency first responder (policing and fire safety); code enforcement; and parks/recreation. All five categories are interrelated and

PUBLIC SAFETY CITIZEN TASK PORCE
SANTACRUZ Introduction and Background 4

City departments work collaboratively to provide the highest quality of life for the Santa Cruz community.

On an average day, the City runs a seamless, but complex operation to ensure a safe environment for the community. Santa Cruz Police and Fire Departments typically respond to hundreds of calls for service of vatying degrees of gravity. The Police Department enForces Federal and State laws and City ordinances. The Fire Department responds to medical calls, fights fires, and performs inspections. Public Works and Park and Recreation Departments maihtain City-owned facilities and the right-of-way. Park. Rangers monitor the City's parks, beaches and open spaces to cnsure order. Code Enforcement upholds the City's building and health standards.
The Task Förde asked the City to provide insight on the safety challenges most burdensome to City operations, that is, those requiring the most staff and fiscal resources, City staff provided written material and testimony that highlighted several recurring themes.
Calls for Service: Calls for service-are at an all-time high, Police responded to an astonishing 104,836 calls for service in 2012 (15,8% increase from 2011). Calls are trending up for 2013. Mapping of the annual calls for service provides insight on areas of public safety concern, from day to night, high tourist season to Low season. The vast majority of calls for service are lacated in close proximity to the San Lorenzo River basin".

In fielding this record volume of calls for service, Police and Fire Department staffs are diverted from other important functions, limiting the amount of time and résources they can devote to prevention activities, training and community outreach.

Repeat Offenders; Repeat offenders create a significant drain on the City's publio safety management resources. The City generated a report in April 2013 to track the number of arrests of repeat offenders (those with more than 10 arrests in the study period), Over a 28-month period--January 2011 to April 2013--146 individuals were arrested a total of 3,598 times: On average, these individuals were arrested 24 times, during this period. Over 50 percent of the arrests wöte related to drugs or alcohol. 13
Crime Rates: Repeät offenders are a part of an intricate puzzle of crime in Santa Cruz. As a destination city; Santa Cruz sees spikes in crime rates for myriad reasons. On any given summer holiday weekend, the City oxperiences an influx of hundreds of thousands of visitors to its tourlst destinations. Santa Cruz is the entertainment hub for the Coutty, and alcohol-fueled violence and crime are factors on weekend nights Dowhtown throughout the year. Out-of-town gang members

The themes noted above (high volume of calls for service, repeat offenders and disproportionately high crime rates) present, a constant set of public safety managemvent challenges for the City. Additionally, several prominent issues routinely compound thèse challonges, resulting in very few *average days' for City public safety operations, Illegal camping and trash dumping, public nuisance and erratic behaviors, addiction-fueled petty crime, alcohol-fueled violence, gang-related drug trafficking and violence, and a "revolving door" criminal justice system place an extremely heavy load on City resources.
Environmental and geographical factors add to the management complexity of these issues as is well. Santa Cruz is the County seat.and the city center is home to the vast majority of North County's soolal and health services, the criminal justice system, and many non-profit social services, resulting in a high concentration of vulnerable people in the heart of the community. The city center is also home to large and forested open spaces, creating an. ideal setting to congregate, hide, take drugs, and commit crime: Taken separately, these conditions pose challenges. With all these factors occurring in concert almost every day of the year, the City and our partners' systems are overwhelmed, creating an untenable public safety management
scenario.

SANTACRUZ PUBLIC SAFETY CITIZEN TASK FORCE
Introduction and Background

The outcome of the Maÿ 29l City-oriented data and testimony validated many of the critical issues identified by the individual Task Force members. Similar top priorities included: substance abuse; environmental and social degradation of City parks, open spaces and business districts; violent crime; and lack of judicial recourse for municipal code violations.
Participating Community Perspective
Staff disseminated an informal poll in early June in preparation of the June 12th Public Comment meeting, Within a week of the poll's release, over thousand responses were tabulated. Although not a statisticully relevant data set, poll results were used to shed light on community perception around public safety issues for those who responded.
Poll respondents were asked to select their top three public safety concerns from à list of identified safety issues generated by the Task Force members; alternatively, respondents could provide their own prioritization and feedback. The results of the poll can be found in the table
*below.

PUBLIC SAFETY CITIZEN TASK FORCE

SANTA CRUZ Introduction and Background

Investment in prevention and treatment of mentai illness and addiction has a higher payoff compared to criminalizing those suffering from these issues.
The City needs more foot patrol police officers.

9 The City needs more low-income housing.
Unemployment plays a large role in our homeless issue. There is not an integrated approach to our regional public safety issues. Bike safety should be a priority. a There is a major problem with how the court system handles drug and public nuisance crimes.
More resources should go to the pursuit and arrest of drug dealers in town. Public discourse around these issues should shift to a conversation about unacceptable
behaviors and crimes rather than housing and health statús.

The public was also provided an opportunity to discuss their concerns with the Task Force at the June 12th meeting. Over 30 members of the community, including four Santa Cruz Youth Council representatives, offered public input. Major themes included:

Overwhelming negative effect of garbage in parks, Levee, open spaces, and other public locations. The need for sharps containers, garbage cans and 24-hour bathroors.
The community needs more drug and mental illness treatment prograins.
Identification requirements for social service recipients.
Need for more affordable housing supply,
Using youth as a resource. Sexual assault and rape should be a high priority, Night Walks program could be an. effective way to decrease crime.
Santa Cruz Sanctuary Camp a could be a tool for decreasing the effects of illegal camping.
The HSC needs more monitoring and patrol around meal times.
In addition to the themes highlighted above, one community member summarized his correspondence with Santa Cruz Police Department (SCPD) Chief Kevin Vogel regarding his perspective on these issues. In these exchanges, Chief Vogel identified the following four broad
topics for the Task Force to consider:
1. The negalive impacts of AB109 on our community. 2. The negative impacts of the County Superior Court's current handling of municipal code infraction citations through a civil process. 3. The negative impaots of lack of treatment programs for drug addiction, 4. The negative Impacts of the high number of high-risk alcohol outlets within the City of Santa Cruz.

The outeome of the public comment session yielded very similar results to the other contact
points with the community, City staff and Task Force members. Comments provided by Chief
Vogel particularly resonated with the oft-noted challenges around substance abuse and the
criminal justice system.

Prioritization and Educational Strategy
The Task Force, with ipput from City staff and the general public, identified three areas of critical interest or themes of study: environmental degradation and behaviors affecting our sense of safety in the City's parks, open spaces, beaches and businesses districts; substance abuse, drug trafficking and related non-violent crime; and gang violence/violent crime. These three critical issues draw significantly on the City's budget and staffing resources, and increasingly limit the ability to pravide the core municipal public safety functions expected by the community. Additionally, the Task Force wanted to understand the interaction of the three identified critical themes with current local and statewide criminal jüstice and governance policies. The Task Force. decided to host a seven-meeting education program to hear from experts in the field, dialog with the City's partner agencies, and gain a broader perspective on the role of the City and its criminal justice regional partners in managing these critical issues. The seven-week program was scheduled as follows:

The educational mectings provided an opportunity for the Task Force fo work with the City and its regional partners to examine the causes and effects of the critical themes of study. The resulting dialog transitioned public discourse around these issues from broad-based assumptions, conjecture and perceptions to an evidence-based and data-driven undetstanding of these public safety chullenges. The Task Force grappled with issues and perceptions very. sensitive in nature to the community, from the role of the homeless and transient populations in perpetuating the effects of Theme and Theme 2, to the role of City and County govemnmental and criminal justice policies in creating a perceived "draw" to Santa Cruz for those participating in all of the identified themes.

Study/Analysis Phase

Introduction

The Task Force's early discussions with City staff and the public established a framwork for the remaining proceedings, Given that testimony and data, it was apparent that not-only are the issues extremely complex, but also fundamentally related. Each thematic Issue compounds. and intensifies the challenges of the others, with substance abuse and addiction seemingly being the catalyst for much of the publio nuisance behaviors and crime in the City.

00024

PUBLIC SAFETY CITIZEN TASK FORCE

SANTAGRUZ Introduction and Background

In order to establish a comprehensive narrative, and èquip themselves with enough information to. make informed decisions, the Task Force was required to be strategic in its course of study, First, given that impressions can greatly influence community image and how community members interact with each other and their environment, it was critically important for the Task Fotce to understand the competing perceptions around each theme and the evolution of thöse
perceptions. Additionally, it was important to evaluate carefully the relationship between the themes. Within that context, developing an understanding of root causes such as addiction, homelessness and mental illness became the priority in that management of symptoms alone has limited effectiveness.

Lastly, in order to identify highly effective solutions fo these challenges, the Task Force needed to understand the ourrent systems in place, outside of the City's jurisdiction, to manage the most critical public safety challenges. Social service and criminal justice systems offer prevention, intervention, enforcement and accountability measures to reduce crime and other satety. challenges. Within a systems discussion framework, thosé working in the social service and criminal justice systems could help identify where program inefficiencies exist and be part of the dialogue to build stronger and more collaborative recommendations that connect the various public safety management pieces,

Theme 2: Diug Addiction and.Non-Violent Crime
Substance abuse and addiction are societal probiems and Santa Crüz is not unique in feeling their damaging effects. Few in our community are free of some connection to this problem. Whether a family member or friend suffers from the disease, or one witnesses open usé of drugs or drug deals, or worse, is a victim of addiction-related crime, this issue impacts us alt. Consequently, we each have an opinion óf the community's problems based on our personal experiences and the stories We share with one another.

The Task Förce heard from indivicuals who shared their stories as they related to the critical themes of study. While not a full, representation of the prablom, one such personal reflection from a heroin addict, Nate, sheds light on the relationship between addiction, petty crime and life on the street as an addiot in Santa Cruz.

Nate

"Ifit's (illicit drugs) got a hold of you, you're going to get what you need no matter what. You'd have to throw -me in jail, lockme up miles and miles away, io kick this habit.'
Nate is a 21-year old heroin addict. Born and raised in Santa Cruz, Nate:split his childhood. between stints at his mother's home in Aptos and his grandmother's home on the Westside of Santa Cruz. Nate started smoking marijuana at nine. He tried heroln for the first time at 16, and acquired à hard-core uddiction by 18.
Nate lives on the streets in Santa Cruz and sustains his $80/day heroin habit by stealing from stores, cars and homes. He diso steals to pay for sustenance (hotel stays and food), In his testimony, he noted it's casy to hang out Downtown because everything an addict needs is in

SANTA CRUZ Introduction and Background

such close proximity. When he needs drugs, he calls a friend or finds someone on the streets. Nate panhandies for small change from people on the streei shen he is hungry and needs a meal, He claimed panhandling is insufficient to support his drug habit in Santa Cruz. Instead, he trades stoien goods for money or drugs.
Nate asserted that he tried for a long time to gët into rehab before his first felony conviction, But, he said, it is impossible to get into a rehab in Santa Cruz that is not "overly religious" or does not require hard labor: Nate now has multiple felony convictions and layers of probation, but is no longer interested in going to rehab. He clalmed the only way to gët clean would be to lock him up in jail, fat away from Santa Cruz.
Näte reported whät he described as a new trend in Santa Cruz. Heroin has become a trendy drug for Santa Cruz high school and UCSC students, with kids as young as 14 using heroin. Heroin is a drug of choice on. the party scene. Nate has frequently seen UCSC students stop their cars and ask to buy heroin.from his friends, Accordinig to Nate, methamphetamine (meth) is more of a street drug used by homeless people than a recreational drug.
Though Nate has used heroin for years, he has never disposed a used syringe in a sharps container, If needed, he said, he will break off the tip of the syringe and throw it in the trash, He believes that a solution to people stealing for drugs is to have more methadone clinics, free food and clean syringes from an easily accessible syringe exchange.
Scope of the Problem/Community Perceptions
Nate is just one example of the highly challenging issues around drug addiction and crime in Santa Cruz, and certainly his story cannot be taken to tepresent the range of addicts and their circumstances, Nonetheless, his account resonates strongly with local attitudes regarding the nature of drug addiction. There is strong community sentiment in Santa Cruz that substance abuse and drug dealing is more prevälent here than other towns with similar demographics. Many believe that (ong-term community tolerance for alcohol.and "recreational" drug use has contributed to County youth ambivalence towards and acceptarce of illicit drug use, while creating a "brand" that draws addicts, dealers and other criminals to our town. From this perspective, such pull factors, coupled with perceived lax drug policies and sentencing of drug related offenses, have created a. vicious oycle of drug abuse and petty crime in our community.
Like many communities throughout the United States and California, Santa Cruz is dealing with widespread use of mheth. Meth seems to have changed the drug user demographio in Santa Cruz over the last several years. Meth users appear more inclined to indulge in risky and violent behaviors and commit crimes at a higher rate compared to addicts of depressant drugs like heroin. There is strong community sentiment that the high population of younger "transients" coming to Santa Cruz use and abuse meth.

There is little community disagreement that substance abuse is a major problem In Santa Cruz
and that addictión leads to imyriad crime and behavior issues. However, there are competing positions regarding the solutions to the problem. Many in the community have expressed concern over a lack of adequate substance treatment and prevention programs: Others believe only

Discussion centered on the state of the community, from the perspective of the Santa Cruz Police Department and Santa Cruz County Health, with regard to substance abuse, local trentment options/best practices, and the relationship between the criminal justice system and drug treatment. The efficacy of the County's Syringe Exchange Program was discussed with emphäsis on the distinction between enabling drug addiction and harm reduction. Nate, the current probafioner/heroin addict, provided a personal perspectiye on the prevalence of drugs in Santa. Cruz County and related crime.
Several problems resonated through panel remarks and follow-up questions. In summary, Santa Cruz has a high concentration of drug and alcohol addicts. Repeat offenders, of which over 50% commit substance-related crimes, create a significant drain on City and County resources, Santa Cruz appears to provide an environment conduciye to untreated and perpetuated addiction due to several factors, There currently is an oversaturation of alcohol outlets and drug dealers in our community. Publicly provided drug abuse treatment is insufficiently funded to meet demand for services. The Serial Incbriate Program (SIP) and Drug Court are successful models for treatment and recidivism reduction, yet remain underfunded, ylelding mixed results. The underfunding of treatmnent options, in combination with overcrowding in the County Jail facilities and light criminal sentencing for drug and non-violent offences, limits the criminal justice system's abllity to effectively adjudicate drug offenses. Thus, a perception has been created among the community (offenders and non-offenders alike) that there is tlttle consequence to substance abuse and related non-violent crime.
Violent and non-xiolent crimes are strongly linked to substance addiction; therefore, prevention and-treatment are paramount to reducing victimization in Santa Cruz. Universally, panelists were adamant that funding of prevention and intervention programs within schools, County Health and Human Services, treatment non-profits, and the crimipal justice system, are more

cost-effective in reducing crime compared to incarceration. The County is home to a is wealth of effective prevention and intervention programs. Unfortunately, most programs are insufficiently funded.

Conclusion

Drug addiction is pervasive in Santa Cruz and, as a result, our community has an untenable situation to overcome. There are many different Interventions that can be effectiye in breaking the vicious cycle of drug addiction and crime (crimes fueled by drug highs and/or theft to support
4 habit), Early prevention and treatment are key and ofteritimés more effective and less expensive than criminal justice interventions like jail time. But in Santa Cruz these strategic interyentions are not currently working to address the bigl concentration of addicts in our community. Prevention and treatment are grossly underfunded and drug sentencing is lax, often leading to probation for felony drug charge convictions. Without an effective management strategy and interventions working seamlessly, the community is left to deal with scores of drug addicts who are unaccountable for their actions and have no resources to overcome their
problems.

Therne 1: Environmental Degradation and Behaviors Affecting our Sense of Safety
Santa Cruz is a community rich in natural resourcés including parks, open spuces and
beaches. We are a community that thoroughly enjoys the outdoors and all the landscape has (o offer. The City's growth policies reflect those valucs, and as a result, our community is blanketed with forested open space and parks. One can traverse from the hills to the sea without louching
foot on pavement.
These sogments of opch space connect our conmunity's essential business and commercial districts to Downtown and the neighboring residential areas. While unique and beautiful landscape to enjoy, the City's network of open space creates a significant public safety and health manägement challenge.
Many in Santa Cruz believe that the comiminity's open spaces and business districts are not enjoygble for several reasons. A high concentration of homeless people live and camp in open nreas stretching from the UCSC campus down through the San Lorenzo River Levee and surrounding purks neat Downtown and the beach area. At times, this homeless populalion comes with erratic behaviors, trash, sleeping materials and human waste. Bchaviors not perceived ns
normal can be off-putting to many and even frightening to others. Waste and the resulting delerioratión of our public spaces create heatth concerns, driving away would-be park users, pärticularly those with small children. One only needs to visit the San Lorenzo Benchlands. Park on.a weekend afternoon to witness the depth of this problem.
Additionally, a ligh concentration of orime takes places along the San Lorenzo River corridor. Fear of crime limits pro-social opportumities along the Levee and,neighboring parks. For some, this fcar translates into an aversion to visit Downtown. Aggressive panhandling, public

district to flourish and graw economically.
In an altempt to manage the challenges around our public spaces and business districts, the City has adopted several municipal codes ordinances to regulate public nuisance behavior. However, the current enforcement and accountability strategy of these ordinances is clearly not working. Many in our community witness the same individuals day in and duy qut behaving in erratic ways, causing disturbances. harassing others, and getting cited for municipal code infractions withaut consequences. This repelitive behavior and the perception that there is no accountability arc genuine concerns and a significant drain on Police, Park and Public Works stuff iesources.

One example of individuals with repeat municipal code violatians and arrests is Miguel DeLeon and Ana Richardson, Their story exemplifies the community's crisis around repcat municipal code offenders and the lack of accountability currently provided by the criminal justice system.

DeLeon and Richardson

"As time went on, he exhibited growing territorial behaviors and a mentality of entitlement. He is almost entirely free of subsiance abuse charges andlor signs of mental illness. He is completely competent that what he is doing is unlawful, yet he has no regard for the law."
Miguel DeLeon is a 40-year-old resident of Santa Cruz. DeLeon is a serial municipal code infraction offender and an constant challenge for the Santa Cruz Police Department. DeLeon and his partner, Ana Richardson, together have hundreds of unpaid.municipal code citations and have cost the City tens of thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours of Police Department and
Citÿ Attorney time.
Qriginally from Elk Grove, DeLeon has lived on the sfreets in Santa Cruz for several years. Richardson, 32, left her Santa Cruz home at age 14. Both street musicians, DeLeon and Richardson "dream of making a living and making the world better place with their music.»I4
DeLeon's first contact with SCPD was in 2002, and since that time he has been a constant fixture of the Santa Cruz criminal backdrop. His offenses are varied - illegal camping, urinating in public, in park space after hours, and washing in publio fountains, amongst others - but the rate of his offonses is constant. SCPD has been managing DeLeon and his behaviors since the first
year he moved from Elk Grove to Santa Cruz.
In 2008, DeLeon began exhibiting territorial behavior around his campsites, at times creating barrters that made entering into businesses impossible for workets and clients. Almost entirely free of substance abuse charges and/or signs of mental illness, he was considered completely competent, and aware that what he was doing was unlawful. Quite simply, he had no regard for the law.

In 2009, with over: 60 unpaid citations at the time, and complaints from the post office, Bunny's Shoes, Borders Books, Lulu Carpenter's, and the Palomat Building, the Cily decided to file a

permanent civil injunction against DeLeon and Richardson to prohibit them from sleeping and committing muni code violations Downtown.
Judge Paul Burdick granted the injunction. Since that time, DeLeon continues to be cited for muni code violations and- continues to live on the streets in Santa Cruz. His behavior has not changed; in fact, his offenses have escalated in severity.
In thè last yeär, DeLeon has been arrested 18 fimes for watrants, probation violations, narcotics, theft, resisting arrest and trespassing. Over that span of 12 months, DeLeon was cited 15 times
for municipal code violations and had eight other SCPD contacts.
Scope of the Problem/Community Perceptions
DeLion and Richardson are indeed just one example of Santa Cruz's difficult problem.of nuisance behaviors in our public spaces. However, there are many others with similar stories, creating disorder Downtown; along the Levee, and in other parts of the City, While not exclusively a homeless or translent issue, there is strong public sentiment in Santa Cruz that the homeless are responsible for much of the behaviors and activities around Theme I. Many in our community perceive transients to be drawn to Santa Cruz because of mild weather, ensy access to drugs, lax criminal justice policies, and plentiful social service provisions.
Many in Santa Cruz believe there to be a significant public health threat due to human waste and hypodermic syringes in our public spaces. While difficult to quantity, many also believe that our business districts suffer due to the disruptive behaviors and loitering,
There is alsò strong public-sentiment in Santa Cruz that those experiencing homelessness should not be persecuted or become scapegoats for the behaviors and activities around Theme 1. As one of the most vulnerable segments of the Santa Crüz population, many believe that our
homelessness problem and the behaviors and activities around Theme l are crimes of circumstance (living in the open) and a Tunction of limited affordable housing options, high cost of living, insufficient social services and/or a lack a of organized homeless camping.
Thus, there seems to be competing sentiments about the supposed causes and solutions to the behaviors and aciivities around Theme 1. Some feel that stronger enforcoment and penalties are required, others feel that underlying factors (i.e., homelessness and substance addiction), which they perceive to be the root causes of thie behaviors mentioned above, should be addressed more is effectively. Fortunately; there is common ground to build upon, as most community members attest that less homelessness is better for all, and we need work together tö address this difficult
issue.

Discussion centered on the environmental, economic, programmatic and budgetury impacts to the City caused by quality-of-life crimes, anti-social behaviors, and illegal camping. Panelists offered their perspectives on best-präctice solutions to reduce behaviors that fuel these problems, ranging from housing homeless individuals and drug and-mental health treatment, to reprogramming/reactivation and enforcement. Several themes crystallized through panel remarks.
and Task Force follow-up questions.

In summary, Santa Cruz has à disproportionately large homeless population (over 3,500 countywide), many living completely unsheltered." Mental illness and uddiction, whether individual conditions or co-occurring, directly influence how a large percentage of our homeless population interacts with the community and our environment. Large swaths of open spacé, heavily forested and abundant in natural cover, provide ideal spaces to camp illegally and commit crime. Our community's open spaces and business districts are geographically linked, moreover; with the San Lorenzo River corridor providing access from encampments to social services and the Downtown district.

Lack of jail space, Ireatment options, and ineffective method's for managing quality-of-life crimes within the crimimal justice system greatly diminish the Santa Cruz Police Department's capacity to limit these behaviors. Calls for service and arrests are at a record high, With heavy concentration along the San Lorenzo River corridor. Despite this effort, the problems persist, Without an effective way to manage this problem, potential for crime and drug abuse to escalate is a concern.
Panelists agreed that solutions need to balance prevention with enforcement. Housing the most vulnerable and chronic homeless demonstrably reduces law enforcement costs and could create a marked improvement to community perceptions around homeless behaviors. With substance
abuse and mentat illness a root cause of the behaviors around Theme 1, preyention and treatment
programs should be considered first. Homeless encampment removals can be effective and long lasting with early outreach and services to those affected. Greater collaboration between law

Conclusion

Santa Cruz has a staggering homelessness problem with over 3,500 individuals countywide. living without a home. This overwhelming number challenges all public and non-profit systems, from hospitals, health care, service providers, and shelters, to parks and open space, to police aud the Superior Court. The impacts on our community members from hosting such lurge population of unsheltered people are real; residents, business owners, visitors, community service workers, public safety officers and homeless individuals themselves feel these impacts on a daily basis.
From a fangible perspeotive, illegal encampments pepper the landscape throughout the City and County. The accumulation of human waste, trash, and spent hiypodermic syringes create real public health hazards and safety issues for park and open space attendees, Further, attitudes of entitiement from illegal campers create physical and social barriers to communal use of many of our open spaces and parks. From a theoretical perspective, as a community of both housed and unsheltered residents, Santa Cruz is faced with a difficult moral dilemma as we share space with fellow citizens living in substandard conditions that affect physical health, mental health and. spirit: Competition over the use of public and community spaces creates divisions within, a community, leading to breakdowns of social cohesion. 16
While the vast majority of homeless individuals in the community abide by the law, Santa Cruz is burdened by a segment of the homeless population that is responsible for escalated disorder and public health concerns. Distüptive behaviors and flagrant disposal of human waste, illegal trash and hypodermic syringes, oftentimes symptoms of substance abuse and mental illness, are a major public health concern and exacerbate fear of crime in Santa Cruz.. A commonly held perception that homelessness is uniquely tied to crime and substance abuse further marginalizes that segment of the community.
À solution to Santa Cruz's homelessness problem is incredibly complex and falls outside of the
chargè of the Task Force. However, there are systems in place to reduce the effects of this staggering problem. Providing housing to those most vulnerable and likely to benefit from additional services is primary goul. It is equally important to bulld new prevention and intervention techniques within the social service and criminal justice systems to manage the most disruptive criminal element of the population,

Theme 3: Gang Violence and Violent Crime
Many kids in Santa Cruz County, especially those from under-represented families, are tangled in a complex web of gang culture. Predominately Hispanic Norteño/Northerner and Sureño/Southener gangs have established territorial lines all over the County. Gangs prey on and

victimize families experiencing poverty and other social inequities, recruiting youngsters looking for a culture of support and conpection. Oftentimes, kids are simply victims of their geographical circumstances, with neighborhoods across the County claimed by certain gangs. Simply living in specifio areas increases one's risk to experience gäng violence and rivalry issues. Families in Beach Flats and Lower Ocean understand this problem first hand.
Many in our community have no personal experience with the damaging effects of gäng violence in Santa Cruz. But that doës not mäke the probiem any less severe for those families involved in gang culture. One such story, of a teenage boy from South County, demonstrates the critical need for everyone in Santa. Cruz to understand the issues around gang violence and oulture.

Juan

"Are you optimistic about your future? No, not really. think I'll probably be dead in a fex years."
Juan is a teenager from Santa Cruz County: A son of migrant färm workers, Juan has spent his entire life in the same house in a rural neighborhood. His parents pick berries for a liying. He is the oldest of the family.
Juan spends eyery minute of his waking hours fearing for his life. Although he has never been "jumped in," Juan is a Sureño gang member by amliation. Juan is a victim of poor judgment and a set of circumstances far outside of bis control. His story is tragic but is no different than the stories of countléss kids living in Santa Cruz County.
Juan's parents migrated to Santa Cruz County äs teenagers and had Juan when they were 19 years.old. In the berry season, his father and mother pick from 6:00 am 6:00 pm, making $1.40 box and $4.00/hour in wages. Picking labor is strenuous and exhausting, leaving Juan's parents oftentimes too tired to care for their children above their most basic needs, On school days growing up, Juan was left to his own devices. He was never self-mötivated in schoof and did not receive consistent support from his parent
Juan's neighborhood is traditionally Sureño. Growing up with kids from the neighborhood with Sureño familial ties, by his middle school years, Juan was identifled Sureño simply by assóciation. While not interested in being officially initiated into the gang, Juan considered himself Sureño and spent most of his school days smoking weed with his friends. He was not involved in after-school programs and no one paid attention to his grades.
Juan attended a local high school for two years but only managed to accrue 10 credits while he was there. He failed nearly every class, leading to his expulsion for failing grades. He-transferred to an alternative high school to finish his high school education. With most kids at the alternative school affiliated with Norteño gangs, Juan was quickly identified as a Sureño scrub. Juan's stint at the alternative school lasted only six months because he was jumped. and severely beaten. He was so traumatized by the experience, he finished high school through the Santa Cruz County Office of Education with their independent study program, commuting to weekly Santa. Cruz to
take classes.

SANTACRUZ Introduction and Background

Although done with high school and currently employed full time, Juan continues to be plagued by his Sureño affiliation. His life has been threatened multiple times, Recontly, while sitting in his car in a parking lot, a Norteño gang member pointed a gun at his head but did not pull the trigger.
Juan is expecting a baby with his teenage girlfriend who lives with her mom in his neighborhood. Her family doesn't know she's having baby. While excited to be a parent and meët his child. Juan worries about how to provide for his girlfriend and his child. He doesn't have the means to rent an apartment. He doesn'i haye a plan for building a career. He feels stuck and has no optimism for his future, In fact, he's not hopeful about seeing his child grow up.
Juan belleves that kids join gangs for the lifestyle. Guns, drugs, girls and partying are the main draw for kids. Initiated young, middle school kids are not aware of the risks involved in gangs or don't believe they'll be involved in the most violent acts. Juän believes that if kids had other interesting things to do, they might be able to stay out of gangs. Most importantly, he maintains that strong family and community support are essential for the survival of Latind youth in Santa Cruz County.
Scope of the. Problem/Community Perceptions
While in recent months much of the community discourse over our public safety challenges has focused pn Theme and Theme 2, there continues to be very deep concerns around gang violence. Juan's story, inoluding the exceedingly difficult circumstances of his life, is a prime example of how a large segment of our community is suffering because of gang issues. Gaing violence has plagued his life even though he never formally joined a gang.
Over the last several years, Santa Crüz has experienced many high-profile aggravated assaults and murders, both- with and without gang associations. There is much community speculation on the role of local gangs in drug trafficking, and how much violent crime is tied to drug deals. Gang initiations create a sense of randomness around youth violence. It is gang interactions often end in acts of axtreme violence. apparent that rival

In conträst to the first two themes, there does not seem to be competing discourse on how fo solve the problems around gang violence. In fact, this theme scems to be the least understood or discussed by those participating in the Task Force proceedings, There was strong agreement, however, that gang violence needs to be examined closely and addressed by the Task Foice.

PUBLIC SAFETY CITIZEN TASK FORCE
SANTACRUZ Introduction and Background

Discussions centered on the hature of gang activity and violence in Santa Cruz County, what gangs are involved, and the social and economic structures in our community that catalyze gang assemblage, drug trafficking and violence.
Gangs within the City of Santa Cruz span racial lines, with territorial rivalries predominately fueling violent crime. Santa Cruz County has approximately 1,200 documented gangs members, of which 64% are 25. years or younger. Current County programs, both preventative and suppression, concentrate resources on the predominately Hispanic Norteño/Northerner and Sureño/Southener gangs, as these gangs are responsible for the vast majority of gang crime and vtolenco in the region.

The Santa Cruz County Gang Task Force deploys predominately in South County, where 75% of the gang cases take place. Rival gang members from outside of the area frequently spark Santa
Cruz City's gang-related violence. South County and neighboring region gang members elect to commit crime in Santa Cruz to avoid detection from local law enforcement. Neighborhoods in Santa Cruz, particularly concentrated in Beach Flats and the Westside, fall vietim to terriforial gang rivulries, much of which does not originate with Santa Cruz gang-affillated residents."7
Overwhelmingly, panelists agreed that prevention and early intervention are critical to limit the
number of young males entering gangs in Santa Cruz County. Because active and supervised youth are much less likely to join a gang, after-school enrichment programs are essential for under-represented and at-risk school children. Families from under-represented and low socio- economic classes need community support and outreach, with wraparound models providing services, counseling and familigrity with law enforcement officials. Panelists agreed that more structuted and supervised activities during the 3:00-9:00 pm timeframe are essential for the engagement of youth in a positive direction.

Conclusion

At-risk youth in Santa Cruz and all across the County are highly susceptible to joining a gang. Economically disadväntaged families often spend a disproportionately high amount of time. working, leaving children to the own devices after school and on weekends.
While gäng violence is not experienced community-wide, Santa Cruz has an obligation nonetheless to manage this problem with prevention and enforcement. After-school programming is essential for pre at-risk and at-risk kids. A child that stays in school and is active after school is much less likely to commit crime, try drugs or join a gang. While an important gang desistance technique, youth programs are capable of far-reaching effects, and have the potential of long-term benefit for crime reduction.

The criminal justice system has two overarching goals: preventing and contrölling crime and achieving justice. It is comprised of many different parts, all-working simultaneously to process

the defendant. Above all, the System is intended to be fair and equally responsive, affording criminal defondants their full rights and societal privileges. When applied appropriately, the criminal justice system can have a positive impact, reducing crime, advocating for victims, correcting behaviors, and successfully reintroducing offenders back into society. When misapplied, the system has the potential to fail in.any or all of those desired outcomes.
Many in Santa Cruz believe our local criminal justice system is failing. SCPD is making more arrests than ever, but crime rates remain high and repeat offenders routinely victimize the community. While difficult to pinpoint the precise causes, it is obvious that the essential elements of the system are not working together as efficiently and effectively as possible.
Bryan Matthew Martin was a habitual offender in Santa Cruz and is now serving a 16-year prison sentence for burglary. His story demonstrates the failure of the criminal justice system in managing our community's repeit öffenders.
Bryan Matthew Martin
"The trial court found true that (the] defendant had to prison priors... The court sentenced him 1O the aggravated five-year term for the röbbery (Pen. Code, § 213, subd. (a)(2)) and one year for each prior prison term, but suspended execution of the sentence and placed defendant on probution. u19
While awaiting trial for stealing backpack from a.hotel worker's car, Bryan Matthew Martin escaped from the Rountree medium-security prison during a lunch break from a recidivism reduction class. He and accomplice, Blaine Richard Collamore, simply walked out of the building, broke into a neighboring house, stole the resident's car and purse and drove away. Martin was arrested iwo days fater and subsequently sentenced to 16 years and 8 months: in prisón. Thät sentence term culminated his eleven-year criminal history in Santa Cruz County.
Born in 1983, Martin is a Santa Cruz local. He was convicted as an adult in 2001 for a felony theft. He received probation for that first adult conviction. Since that time, Martin wracked up the following record;

PUBLIC SAFETY CITIZEN TASK FORCE
SANTACRUZ Introduction and Background

Martin went to prison twice In 2004 and 2005 and was convicted of 13 additional felonies in 2006. The court ordered a 4 year, 8 month suspended prison sentence at that time, meinning if he
violated his probation he would automatically serve the imposed sentence,
Following the 2006 convictions, Martin was convicted of four misdemeanors from 2008- 201 C. He was given probation for each, rather than the suspended sentence.
While on probatión, Martin was convicted of robbery in 2011. The District Attorney in that case asked for prison time, especially given his suspended sentence from 2006 and the subsequent repeat misdemeanors. The judge declined, senlencing Martin to one year in County Jail and suspended another 7-year prison term.
Due to the Court's soft handling of Martin, he wa's allowed to victimize the community to the tune of 30 convictions of 18 felonles, receiving only tyo years of prison time over the course of
a decade. It took Martin's brazen escape from Rountree and subsequent melee for him to finally receive a significant sentence. Prior to that incident, each time his prison sentence was suspended by a Santa Cruz Supertor Court judge, subsequent judges falled to impose the sentence for significant probation violations, leaving Martin free to repeatedly victimize the community.
Scope of the Problem/Community Perceptions
There are numerous other repeat offenders in Santa Cruz, many with felony convictions. Many repeat offenders are low-level criminals that accumulate municipal code infraction citations, and then, over timne, escalate in criminality to misdemeanors and felonies, Because of the problems around repeat offenders, there is substantial public sentiment that local and state-wide criminal justice and govermental policies contribute directly to the severity of Themes 1-3. Many believe thät the Santa Cruz Superior Court and jail system are essentially "revolving" doots for criminals, particularly those with substance abuse issues,
is There is also significant public concern around the issuänce of civil penalties for the City's municipal code infractions. Many in the community believe this civil process to he completely ineffective and pattially responsible for the perceived "draw" of criminals and transients to Santa Cruz.

The local effects of AB109 are also widely speculated on by the public. Many believe that Santa Cruz has seen a shift in demögraphics of our homeless and transient population as a result of this legislation, with many more violent criminals on our streets and committing crimes.

The two-part meeting covered a range of topies, but focused particularly ou the role of the criminal justice system in managing the behaviors and activities around the other three themes of study. The panelists identified several problems, Although all of the specific issues had been raised at previous meetings, the City's criminal justice partners voiced several areas of heightened concern.
The City Attorney, acting as municipal code infraction prosecutor, lacks adequate resources to prosecute effectively the concentration of nuisance crimes committed locally. As a resuli, the City Aftorney pursues only the most egregious cases. However, a relatively small number of individuals, around 100 in a typical year, are respousible for the vast majority of the unadjudicated citations.
The community's sorial inebriate population is significänt drain on public resources across the spectrum, from law enforcement to hospital emergency rooms. With jait overcrowding and, funding constraints, the SIP program is not as effective as it could. be.
A significant portion of the City's crime takes place along the San Lorenzo River comridor. The environmental design of the Levee and lack of programming in the adjoining parks and neighborhoods contributes to the prevalence of loitering, problematic behaviors and crime along the river corridor. All panelists voiced support for revitalizing and reprogramming the Levee and adjoining areas.
Panelists further discussed Santä Cruz crime rates. There wa's consensus among the panelists thrat the rates of crime ate decreasing, across all.types of offenses, in line with California and national crime rates. However, they posited that crime rates remain too high, and our rates are skèwed because we are an extremely popular destination (for tourists, students, families, transients and criminals alike) and the central city for Santa Cruz County (county seat, home to the main,jall
and major entertainment district in the region, etc.)
A current case study of violent criminals, specifically those in custody for murder, was discussed. Of the 18 casès currently pending, 17 are local residents, and 15 went to high school in Santa Cruz County. The point was made that our violent criminals are primarily local, and not out-of-towners drawn to Santa Cruz for services and community tolerance of criminogenic lifestyles.20
This information was in contrast to a casè study provided earlier in the proceedings by Judge Symons. That case study focused on a number of homicides committed within the homeless or transient population over the last several years and noted a common series of eyents leading to. the tragedy, Symons argued that there is a transient population in our community drawn to Santa Cruz to live a criminogenic lifestyle. Fueled by addiction and sustained by social service

provisions, the offenders committed crimes of escalating significance over several months, starting with public nuisance violations and ending in homicides. Heavier enforcement of the lesser crimes, consistent with the "broken window" theory of crime preventlon, was suggested by a Judge Symons as a way to intervene in this series of events. 21
The expert panelists discussed management of violent criminals. All were in agreement that
violent crime is effectively adjudicated within the criminal justice system. Police enforcoment
and investigations are surcamlined, the District Attorney buflds solids cases, conviction rates are high, but trials are fair, and the Public Defender's office frequently prevaits when evidence does not suggest a guilty verdict. Juries in Santa Cruz do not shy away from convicting violent criminais. This may be in contrast to juries on lower level offenses.22
Both panels highlighted insufficient early prevention and education as contributors to the safety issues in Santa Cruz. School-aged children are our most vulnerable population; therefore early and effective prevention of drug abuse and truancy would greatly teduce fulure crime locally. Finally, the panèlists voiced sttong support for problein solving courts like Drug, Flomeless,
Veteruns, etc;

Conclusion :

Literally hundreds of individuals in our community walk through the doors of the Superior Court every day. Hundreds are in our local jails. Hundreds more are contacted, cited, and arrested by our police officers. Each person bears a unique set of conditions that propelled him or her into the criminal justice system. Some may be oxperlenting homelessness or suffering from addiction or mental illness. Others may have been recruited into a gang as a youngster. Many have cycled through the system for years, nèvet achieving successful rehabilitation and assimilation back into society,
A community's trust and confidence in its criminal justice system is built upon perceptions of Fairness and effectiveness. These perceptions may be widely skewed depending on an individual's relationship with the system (offender, victim, observer, community member) and how the system is portrayed in the media (both social and traditional).

Sce Appondix for more inforiation. 22 The iecont spike in violent crime contributed to the creation of the Task Force and was ohe of the highest concerps of individual Task Forçe members at the beginning of the process. However the course of study and follow-up questions did nol focus dircctly on violent crithe, but rather its intérsection with the other major themes of study. This is likely because panclists exhibiied confidence in the criminal justice system as il relates to the management of violent offenders. In addition, violent crime is à more difficult tssue-to tackle, with many dynamic variables. Unlike the other themes of study, violent crime is less of a systemic issue with common root causes. Causes are widespread, variable and dependent oid many factors.
This decision of the Task Force was not made liglitly, nor docs it reflect upon the importance of the issue. Violent crime scars victims and their families for life, and contributes to perceptions around safely in the community. However, the lime constraints placed upon the group and the realities of violent crime (i.e., it is typically random and sporadio) led the Task Force to focus on themes of study that sere systemic ant citgwide, and which the Task Force was reiatively optimistic it could improve.

SANTACRUZ Introduction and. Background

Testimony received by the Task Force indicates that Santa Cruz's confidence in its criminal justice systent is low and in line with the rest of the Country. Recent Gallup polls demonstrate that only a third of Americans have confidence in their criminal justice system. This is in striking contrast to confidence lévels in policing, with 60% of respondents expressing a great deal or quite a bit of confidence in that institution.23 Our community's support for our police force is likely at an all-time, high.
As demonstrated by the data and testimony provided by the expert panelists, Santa Cruz's criminal justice system is overburdened and dealing with ah extenuating set of circumstances. Ratès of addiction are high, leading to property crime. A segment of the homeless population is susceptible to escalating criminality; victimization among our homeless is a grave concern. Repeat offenders, especially those with low-level, non-violent and drug offenses are difficult to adjudicate for lack of jail space and treatment options. But even though the criminal justice system is burdened with these challenges, it has a real obligation to the community of Santa Cruz to apply justice and rehabilitation in an effective manner and to reduce the impact
criminals have on the community. Our community's trust in the system will not increasè unless steps are taken to rectify these very serious concerns.

Treasurer Fred Keeley convened the Task Force deliberations on recommendations. The Task Force adopted a legislative process for this aspect of its work. The fundamentals of the legislative process are outlined as follows:

City Staff provided a draft teport of recommendations for the first round of deliberations. The Task Force moved, line-by line, through the document and was asked to indicate where they had tentative agreement and items for amendment. The voting membership of the Task. Force was fourteen (14) members. A majority was eight (8). It was suggested that the Task Force resolve as many issues as possible by consensus. For those points where a consensus could not be reached, à majority vote prevailed.
In order to provide the maximum opportunity for reaching consensus on the final work product, the Task Force adopted a "Caucus" procedure. This gave individual members a moment to spcak in a less formal setting. Each deliberative meeting produced a new draft recommendation report. Subsequent deliberative meetings followed the same procedure until each recommendation was voted on and adopted.

Policy Recommendations Srsicmpacia xs/ow ajinniocdactadyutrgrontasSORA0  er SCOgAVe
The follosing recommendations came from a variety of sources - experts, community members .- and individual Task Force members. Every recommendation presented was considered by the Task Forco. The Task Force was provided with substantial data, material and testimony and used that information to make these recommendations,
Public safety policy recommendations consist of'a four-pronged approach: prevention, strategic enforcement with accountability, collaborative oversight, and appropriate funding,
Highest Priority Prevention Initiatives

Although more long-range in nature, preventative programs are essential to reduce crime and victimization in a sustainable fäshion. The Task Force recommends policy changes to be heavily weighted towards prevention initiatives, with the City, County, schools, neighborhaods and our non-profit service partnors playing an integral role in funding, implementation and management.
Prevention initratives should include the following highest priorities:
1, Environmental design and protection of high crime areas and open spaces 2. Enhancement of drug and alcohol treatment funding 3. Expansion of pro-social youth programs

PUBLIC SAFETY CITIZEN TASK FORCE
SANTACHUZ Policy Recommendations

Environmental Design and Protection of High Crime Areas and Open Spaces

Findings

Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design (CPTED) and reactivation of spaces are data- driven crime prevention programs. With proven efficacy in many cities, CPTED reduces criminal opportunity through landscape and architectural design of space (lighting, visibility, cover reduction, etc.) while reactivation is intended to create pro-social actiyities in public locations. Environmental design and pro-social activities are laoking in the City's greenbelt and commercial areas, particularly along the San Lorenzo River corridor, on Pacific Avenue, and in Harvey West.
The County's Syringe Services Program (SSP) is effective in lowering the fransmission of blood bornè discases such as HIV and Hopatitis C for intravenous drug uses. However, the Task Force finds that the County has not properly accounted for and mitigated the unintended consequences. of locating a syringe exchange within a residential neighborhood and the geographical boundaries of Santa Cruz. No spent hypodermic syringes should be found in the City's open. spaces, parks, neighborhoods, beaches and business districts. Until this public health orisis is rectified, the Task Force finds that the County Board of Supervisors should consider the management of SSP a top priority.

Recommendations

The Task Force recommends a comprehensive environmental design and programming study of the City's most crime-ridden public and commeroial arêas. The study's implementation plan should be phased to target the community's highest areas of safety concern. Wbile the study is underway, the City should immediately improve lighting oni the San Lorchzo River Levce and Park and the Harvey West arèa to discourage illegal behavior and reinvigorate those public,
spaces.

With regard to the County's Syringe Exchange Program, the Fask Force recommends that City staff and the City Council work with the County Health Services Agency and 31%sth District Supervisor Office to ensure the public safety efficacy (harm reduction of users and community affected by discarded syringes) of the County's Syringe Services Program. The following méasures are considered the highest priority by the Task Force:
Insist that the County Board of Supervisors address the community-wide inpacts of SSP on their work plan/agenda. Ensure best practices are in place for SSP to mitigate impacts to the City's public spaces and neighborhoods.
0 Relocate SSP to County-owned property located in a non-residential area.
Q Implement a syringe identification tagging program (e.g. color coding or serial
number). O Exchange to be on a true one-for-one basis with an actual physical count of syringes being exchanged. No estimations should be allowed,

36

00042

PUBLIC SAFRTY CITIZEN TASK FORCE
Policy Recommendations
SANTACRUZ

O Account for both syringes being distributed and returned. Account separately for syringes without identification tag.
9 City should prevent additional syringe exchange programs from operating or opening
within the City limits.

Enhancement of Drug and Alcohol Treatment Funding

Findings

Treatment of drug addiction is underfunded in Santa Cruz County, Given that addiction treatment lowers the rate of criminal recidivism, the Task Force finds that investment in (and
greater collaboration between) proven effective treatment programs is essential,

Recommendations

The Task Force therefore recommends that City Counoil and staff work with the County Board of Supervisors and the County Health Services Agericy staff on the County Strategic Plan for Alçohol and Drug Treatment and Intervontion to insure that proven, evidence- based interventions and treatment programs that address specific City needs are included in the Strategic. Plan and adequately funded.
Needs specific to the City noted by the Task Force include the followingt
Reduce publio anti-social behaviors caused by serial inebriates and drug users. Reduce both violent and non-viotent crime caused by addiction to opiates and other
drugs.
With these measures, the Task Force believes that the County's Strategic Plan will fürther help to delineate the problems and their interventions and treatment that contribute to unsafe
environments.

Expansion of Pro-Social Youth Programs

Findings
The Task Force finds that an investment in our youth is part of an essential strategy to reduce fituie criminal behavior. Children that stay in schoo) and are active under adult supervision during after-school hours are far less likely to try drugs and/or alcohol, develop addiction, join gangs, and engage in criminal activity as young adults.

Recommendations

The Task Force recommends leveraging existing programs and, if necessary, consider creating new programs to providc pro-social activities, focusing on the 3-9 p.m. petiod, that serve both at- risk and pre at-risk youth. These programs should include activities that appeal to particular

cultures and subcultures (0.g., baile folklórica and skate bourding) as well as programs that bring different cultures and subcultures together (such as Little League and soccer), These programs should be both attractive to a wide variety of youth and focus on minimizing barriers fo participation, such.as costs, accessibility, complex sign ups/initiation processes, location of programs, hours and duration of programs.
° City should create a mechanism to inform community residents, businesses and non-
profits on how to proyide scholarships for Task Force recommended youth programming
initiatives.

City Park and Recreation Department (P&R) shall develop an outreach strategy that
targets underserved youth in our community with the goal being to involve them in more
P&R programs. The outreach should be both in English and Spanish,
Bnsure that the long range plan for P&R includes appropriate facilities for demographic trends and to increase participation rates.
Youth Programming recommendations should include information published by the Criminal Justice Council Report on Youth Viblonce.

Secondary Priority Prevention Initiatives

Additional preventative recommendations were identified by the Task Force for City Council consideration. These include more specific youth programming initiatives, Iruancy enforcement ephancements, education and noighborhood connection, and enhancements to social service activities.

Highest Priority Strategic Enforcement with Accountability Initiatives

Findings

The mission of the Santa Cruz Police Department (SCPD) is to provide proteotion and services to our community: With a $23 million annual budget and 94 budgeted sworn officers serving : population of 62,000, the force runs a lean operation. In fact, an average police force for a city of 60,000 is about 140 sworn efficers.24 As a destination spot for summer fourists, University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC) students, and transients, and as an entertainment hub for Santa Cruiz County and beyond, the SCPD is often stretched extremely thin.
SCPD currently has 6 vacant officer positions, with several officers out on work related and non- work related injurics, and several other individuals in the training process. In. total, SCPD are at 75 percent of sworn strength in the field. Currently there are no gaps in service or coverage. However, this shortage puts a significant strain on those officers serving the community.. While there are a number of factors contributing to officer attrition (the recent tragedy, long-term disability, retitement, etc.), SCPD historically has had difficulty maintaining a fully-staffed force. With ourrent staffing levels, it becomes difficult to effectively balance department priorities: crime prevention, investigations, community programming, eto.
Public nuisance/quality of life crimes and repeat offenders put a heavy strain on SCPD resources. Calls for service are at an all-time high, and individuals that self-affiliated with the Homeless Services. Center (by providing 115 Coral Street address at the time of arrest) accounted for about 40%.of arrests and 30 % of citations in 2012. Repeat offenders, averaging 100 individuals per 25 year, are responsible for a staggering number of (otal arrests." Over 50 percent of repeat offender arrests are in some manner related to drugs or alcohol.
SCPD's record volume of repeat offender arrests and municipal code violations is a symptom of failing criminal justice system for low-level crimes in Santa Cruz County, Lack,of jail space, treatment options, Probation Department capacity, and the Superiot Court's apparent indifference fo nuisance crimes has created an endless cycle of recidivism among low-level
criminals.

Santa Cruz is burdened with a high number of high-risk alcohol outlets. Santa Cruz is approved by Alcohol and Bêverage Control (ABC) for 102 alcohol outlets and currently has 249. In addition, Santa Cruz is pverburdened with residential indoor and outdoor marijuana grow operations for medical and recreational purposes. High-risk alcohol outlets contributè to alcohol- fueled violence and crime. Growing, cultivation and processing of marijuana in residential neighborhoods is a serious public safety concern, a code enforcement issue, and often involves criminal activity. The Task Force finds that 1strategic intervention is required to improve community conditions around addiction-related crime and public nuisance behaviors in our neighbothoods, open spaces, parks, and business districts. Therefore, the Task Force recommends four priorities: strategio police and code enforcement, offender assistance with
accountability/recidivism reduction, and criminat justice system accountability.

PUBLIC SAFETY CITIZEN TASK FORCE

SANTACRUZ Policy Recommondations

Recommendations

Strategic Police Enforcoment
The Task Force has identified several critical priorities for SCPD. The Task Force recommends the City, with the highest priority and utmost urgency, fill existing and budgeted SCPD vacancies and, further, to increase the SCPD police force to national averages. The Task Force recommends moying to a targeted policing model, with a strätegy that emphasizes enforcement of nuisance crimos tn natural, city entry and focal pöint areas (i.e., a "broken window" policing model).
in additión, to enhance the City's enforcement of repeat municipal code offenders, the City Council should designate existing infractions as misdemeanors in the municipal code for current infractions such as depositing of public waste, multiple offenses for illegal camping, and other offonsés that the City Council designates to curb quality of life crimes in the City. This recommendation would include a request to the County to fund a municipal code prosecutor as well as designating the revenue from current infraction penalties to fund the increased court
costs.

Strategic Code Enforcement
The PSTF recommends two priorities for enhanced code enforcement:
City Council to work with Code Enforcement to reduce and reform high-risk alcohol outlets, Rewrite the municipal code 6.90.040 to prohibit the cultivation and processing of marijuana in residential properties in Santa Cruz City. Marijuana should be subjèct to the same zoning regulations as other agriculture.
Offender Assistance with Accountability/Recidivism Reduction
The Task Force recommends a specialty court model for substance abusers, vetcrans, mentally Ill and/or homeless offenders, The specialty court model is próven to balt the revolving door of recidivism by linking offenders to treatment and rigorous judicial monitoring. Specialty courts are highly collaborative, bringing together the criminal justice system and seryice providers to enforce court-ordered sanctions. The Task Force finds that the spccialty cout model would provide offenders with the right balance of treatment assistance with accountability.
The Task Force recommends that the City collaborate in developing a strategic multi-disciplinary team (enforcement, criminal justice, drug treatment, social service providors) to idenfify individuals repeatedly exhibiting behaviors and crimes harmful to the community (i.e., the "top offenders" as identified by SCPD), This strategic team will develop an intervention and accountability plan on a case-by case-basis for cach offender in order to reduce criminal behavior and harm to the community. The overall goal of the team would be reduce recidivisin and crime in the City. The strategic team would work, with SCPD to identify those that are generating the most çalls for services, arrests, and municipal code infraction, citations.

42

00048

PUBLIC SAFETY CITIZEN TASK FORCE
S SANTA CRUZ Policy Recommendations

Additionally, after implementation of the photo identification system and gate atthe Homeless Services Center (HSC) campus, the City should work with HSC campus managers to minimize unintended negative impacts of homeless services to Santa Cruz community, while maximizing program effectiveness. Agencies located at Coral Street (on HSC campus) should cooperate with SCPD in recommendations to modify or eliminate services to persons identified as chronic offenders who threaten public safoty.
The purpose of this recommendation is to improve accountability for those that continually break the law and have repeat municipal code violations.
Superior Court Accountability
The Task Force finds that the Santa Cruz County Courts have failed the community as it relates to criminal sentencing. Improved accountability should take the form of increased transparency, consistent adjudication of the City's municipal code violations, and implementation of a specialty court model (as noted above),
The Task Force recommends the following measures be implemented by the Santa Cruz County Superior Court:

Court to issue a misdemcanor warrant after three failures tò appear in a six-month period. This automatic warrant issuance will eliminate the rieed for the City Attorney to prosecute repeat municipal code infraction offenders who fail to appear. Compel the Presiding Judge of the Santa Cruz County Superior Court to appear before the Santa Cruz City Council twice year to share what the Court is doing to address high repeat offender tates in the City of Santa Cruz and to receive input from the City Council and City Altorney.
Secondary Priority Strategic. Enforcement with Accountability Initiatives
Several addilional recommendations were identified by the Task Force with regard to Strategic Enforcoment with Accountability, In general, secondary priority recommendations are more specific about new policing strafegies, code enforcement, and additional accountability measures within the criminal justice systemn,

Now initiatives including Whole Person Care (WPC), Drug Medi-Cal Organized Delivery System (DMC-ODS), Integrated Behavioral Health (IBH), and the expansion of Medipation Assisted Treatmhent (MAT) make HSA better positioned than eyer to help SSP clients Interrupt the oyole of iaddiotion, poverty and homelessness. This report details HSA's plan to leverage new capacity to create a better SSP and Increase public health and safety.

Background
Relevant Public Health Concerns: SSP is an evidence-based public health intervention with the goal of reducing the risk of exposure to infection and disease, and preventing oplojd-related death in Santa Cruz County through säfer injection practices. Listed below are public health concerns which have intersected with SSP from 2017 to 2019.
Hepatifis.A California experienced a significant hepatitis A outbreak in 2016-2018, primarily among persons experiencing homelessness and/or using drugs in settings of limited sanitation. Although the outbreak In California is now over, other states continue to experience outbreaks in similar populations of at- risk people. This outbreak began in San Diego County in November 2016 and spread to the counties of Santa Cruz, Los Angeles and Monterey. San Diego and Santa Gruz reported the greatest number of cases. By the end of the outbreak, Santa Cruz County had reported 76 cases, 33 hospitalizations and one death related to hepatitis A. Attached is a CDPH summary of the statewide outbreak (Exhibit 1: CDPH Report Hepatitis A Outbreak, April 2018).
During the outbreak; HSA's SSP was a beneficial venue to engage with the at-risk population. Approximately one third of ali people who inject drugs (PWID), including a third of those also experiencing unstable housing, were able to be vaccinated for hepatitis A using the SSP; Ari additional benefit of using the SSP as an opportunity to vaccinate is the rapport built over time as some ollents took multiple visits before they agreed to be vaccinäted. Attached is additional information about Santa Cruz County's epidemiological analysls of SSP utilizatlon during the hepatitis A outbreak (Exblbit 2: Council of State and Territorial Epidemiolagists (CSTE) Conference - Use of Syringe Exchange in the Controt of an Outbreak of Hepatitis A Among Injection Drug Users Who Are Experiencing Unstable Housing, Santa Cruz County, California 2017, Abstract, June 13, 2018).
HIY Outbreaks in Other States Although diagnoses of human immunodefiolenoy virus (HIV) infection among persons who inject drugs in the United States are declining, an HIV outbreak among such persons in riral Indiana demonstrated this population's vulnerability to HIV infection. A Yale study of the outbreak concluded that it could have been prevented, had State leaders acted sooner to heed public. health leaders' recommendations to establish syringe exchange and other programs to prevent HIV transmission.

In August 2018, Public Health-Seattle and King County (PHSKC) identified a cluster of cases of HIV infeotion among persons living homeless, most of whom injected drugs. Investigation identified 14 related cases diagnosed from February to mid-November 2018 among women who inject drugs and men who have sox with women (MSW) who inject drugs and their sex partners. All 14 persons were living homeless in an approximately three-square mile area and were part of a cluster of 23 cases diagnosed since 2008. Twenty-seven cases of HIV infection were diagnosed among women and MSW who inject drugs in King County during January 1 to November 15, 2018, a 286% increase over the seven cases diagnosed in 2017. The outbreak is part of a larger increase in HIV infection among heterosexual persons who inject drugs that is ongoing in King County, During 2018, King County experienced a nearly threefold increase in new HIV infections among women and MSW who inject drügs.
Seyeral factors might contribute to King County's vulnerability. First, although access to HIV care and prevention in the county is generally good, this outbreak was concentrated in an area where syringe and clinical services for persons who inject drugs are Ilmited, highlighting the need to expand access. Second, like much of the United States, King County faces growing epidemics of opioid overdose and homelessness. From 2007 to 2018, the number of heroin overdose deaths In the county increased 264%, and from 2007 to 2017, the number of county residents living hameless inpreased 47%, Among SSP users surveyed in 2017, 43% were living homeless, and an additional 26% were unstably housed, a 19% increase from 2015.
Thus, the area has a rapidly growing population who inject drugs and are living homeless, a group for whom accessing services is particularly difficult. These factors have resulted in a new population-level susceptibllity to HMV transmission.

Wound Botulism Botulism is a rare but serious paralytio illness caused by a nerve toxin that is produced by the bactarium Glostridium botulinum. Wound botulism is caused by toxin produced in a wound infected with. Glostridjumi botulinum. Untreated, botulism can progress to respiratory paralysis and death. All forms of botulism can be fatal and aro considered medical emergencies.
Every year in the United States, about. 20 people are diagniosed with wound botulism. California recently experienced clusters of wound botulism associated with the injection of contaminated black tar heroin. Santa Cruz County sustained one confirmed case of wound botulism in a local resident in early 2019. Attached is a publio information document, produced by the Communicable Disease Unit of HSA's Public Health Division, regarding wound bofullsm (Extibit 3: HSA Information Sheet - Wound Bofulism, March 2019).
The risk of getting wound botulism increases with injection drug use, especially black tar heroin, under the skin ("skin popping") or into the muscle ("musole popping" or "muscling"). Skin or muscie popping creates an environment conducive to the formation of the botulinum toxin.
Botulism is known to be prevalent in contaminated black tar heroin. Black tar heroin use poses a heightened risk for wound botuism due to its production, proparation, and practice. Black tar heroin is a dark, gummy drug that often contains adulterants to increase its bulk. It may contain contaminants introduced during illicit transport to the United States, such as inside cartires or other unsanitary (ocations where the drug might be exposed ta soil containing C. botulinum spores, People who use this drug prepare the black tar heroin for injection by cooking it; however, the botullnum toxin can survive High heat and later germinate to produce nerve toxini.
Opioid Overdose Sarta Cruz experienced 18 deaths due to ali opioid-related overdoses in 2017, the most recent calehdar year of data available. The annual crude mortality rate during that period was 6.9 per 100k residents. This reprèsents a 37% decrease from 2015. Though the trend is decreasing, Santa Cruz County's opioid-related death rate is higher thän the State's rate. Attached is a CDPH report of data for oploid overdose data for Santa Cruz County for approximately three years from 2015 Quarter 4 to 2018 Quarter 3 (Exhibit 4: CDPH Sarita Cruz County Öpioid Overdose Data, 2015 to 2018).

Statutory Requirements: On January 1, 2006, AB547 became. law and legalized services for health care providers to exchange used Intravenous syringes for new clean ones (syringe exchanges) in California without the need for a declaration of a state of local emergency due to a significant risk-of the spread of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infectlon by injection drug users. Subsequent laws passed, AB110 (2007) and AB6Q4 (2011), which require:
"(a) The health officer of the participating jurisdiction shall present biennially at an open meeting of the board of supervisors a report detailing the status of olean needle and syringe exchange programs, including, but not limited to, relevant statistics on bloodborne infections associated with needie sharing activity and the use of public funds for these programs. Law enforcement, administrators of alcohol and drug treatment programs, other stakeholders, and the public shall be afforded ample opportunity to comment at this biennial meeting, The notice to thei public shall be sufficient to ensure adequate participation in the meeting by the public. This meeting shäll be noticed in accordance with all state and looal open meeting laws and ordinances, and as local officials deem appropriate."
County Implementation History
April 30, 2013 - Following statewide leglslation vastly increasing access and availability of syringes, and in response to Increasing community concern regarding the accountability of syringe services and a high prevalence of discarded syringes in public plades, the Board approved HSA's administration of a new SSP without additional funding for operations or staffing. SSP home dellvery and moblle exchange services that were previously provided by a volunteer group, Street Öutreach Services (SOS), were discontinued after HSA assumed program responsibility. In addition to the program's core component of syringe collection and distribution, the SSP also provided education and referrals for substance use treatment. The SSP Advisory Group first convened in March-2013. Since then, the group has met regularly to provide guldance for the program.
June 18, 2014 - The Board approved HSA's recommendatione to reduce SSP hours from 18.5 to 10 hours per week at the Emeline site. Additionally, Board direction resulted in capping the number of syringes distributed per individual to 1:1 and allowing exceptions to 1:1 exchange only for those meeting criteria for Medlcal or First Encounter exceptions,
June 23, 2015 - The Board accepted a report and update of the SSP and directed HSA to provide the next program status report biennially, as delineated by Assembly Bill 604.
June. 6, 2017 - The Board authorized HSA to discontinue the provision of additional syringes vla Medical or. First Encounter exceptions,
Program Staffing, Evolution, & 2019 Reorganization: The initial goals of the program wore to implement a public health intervention proven to reduce transmission of blood-borne palhogens, and to reduce the number of improperly discarded syringes in the community. Due to limited hours, funding and staffing, HSA operated the program until very recently as a stand-alone service, with temporary staffing assignments rotating amongst existing staff.
Since 2017, HSA made dramatic strides in implementation of new programs including: WPC, DMC-ODS, IBH, and MAT. HSA has increased integration and availability of these broad-reaching programs and services that address physical and behavioral health needs of residents as well as social determinants of health such as housing. This new capacity created an opportunlty to optimize SSP as venue to reach populations who ace homeless, mentally Ifl, and struggle with addiotion, who would otherwise not access available education, health care, and housing services.
In February 2019, SSP was reorganized from a stand-alone, part-time prögram to operate within the Public Health Division Communicable Diseäse Unit (CDU), under the oversight of the Director of Nursing. Nurses, program staff, and epidemiologiste of the CDU have begun working in SSP to identify opportunities for quality-improvement in programmatic operations and S8P data analysís. Collaborative planning resulted in a new staffing structure in which. SSP is implemented by a team of program, public health nurse, and certified addiction counseling staff working in partnership with WPC, DMC-ODS, IBH and MAT. With this change in oversight and program structure, the program's metrics and performance indicators are being evaluated to create sustainable, continuoús quality improvement.

Syringe Litter: The SSP has maintained three community syringe disposal kiosks (one in Watsonville and two in Santa Cruz). In this operational perlod, the program has colleoted 1,589,234 syringes, compared with 1,053,379 syringes dispensed during the personalized client services. The program has partnered with the County's •Department ot Publio Works (DPW) to service kiosks and oversee other syringe litter collection throughout the County, HSA has contracted, both dfrectly and through DPW, for increased cleanup in areas at high-risk for syringe lifter. SSP has three additional syringe disposal klosks in storage for immediate placement in areas with high needs, such as the homeless.encampment near Gateway Plaza in Santa Gruz. Finally, HSA ls willing to collaborate more deeply with the City of Santa Cruz as they work to address the syringe litter. issue within the city limits,
All SSP participants are offered personal shärps containers and education on safe disposal of used syringes. Established SSP participants typically return their used syringes in an appropriate sharps container. The perception among SSP participants is that the accessibillity of SSP assists with reducing needle litter in the community, People who are actively using drugs have expressed they do not want to oarry or hold onto large amounts of eyringès until the next available day of SSP. It is Impractical to have a surplus of supplies, espeoially for those who are homeless, However, if the SSP is unavailable, people may hold onto their unused syringes, thus increasing the risk of improper disposal. By improving the accessibility of the program, the frequency of SSP participation may increase, therefore minimizing the risk of improper syringe disposal.
Although there Is existing research indicating that increased syringe distribution services are not correlated with Increased syringe litter, further local assessment is warranted to assist the SSP with developing focused interventions to improve-syringe.disposal. CDPH has offered to conduct an evaluation of syringe litter in Santa Cruz County, This study would include field observations of areas identified to be at-risk for improper syringe disposal as well as fogus groups with people who inject drugs. The focus groups would ask questions related to the participant's behavior and attitude around syringe disposal. CDPH would collaborate with the SSP to tailor the evaluation for the County's needs, similar to the study conducted for Orange County (Exhibit 5: Orange County Needle Exchänge Program Expanded Service Area Syringe Litter Report, Draft.). This study would provide HSA with data regarding where to focus resources to reduce the presence of syringe litter.
2016-2017 Grand Jury Report: The 2016-2017 Civil Grand Jury issued the following relevant Findings and Recommendations in its 'Sharper Solutions' report approved by the Board of Supervisors on August 22, 2017 (Exhibit 6: 2016-2017 Santa Cruz County Civil Grand Jury Report 'Sharper Solutions', June 27, 2017; and the Health Services Agency Response, August 14, 2017).
Finding #F4: The SSP currently operates without a budget or permanent staff, which hinders the success of prögram goals.
Finding #F6: Limited hours, space, and staff hamper roferrals to couniseling, treatment, and support programs, reducing the number of people receiving assistance.
Finding #F8: Some injection drug users don't travel to SSP sites, thus preventing them from receiving assistance from other health programs.
Recommendation #R5: HSA should devote more time and resources to community autreach to promoté rehabilitation and counseling of SSP olients.
Recommendation #R6: HSA should implement a mobile needle exchange unit to increase access to SSP sörvices.

Recommendation #R7: HSA should post hazardous waste signs with a single contact number for advide or reporting, available 24/7, in areas where syringes are commonly found.
California Department of Public Health Best Practices: At the most recont Advisory Group meeting on April 30, 2019, a CDPH representative provided a presentation on state-recommendations and best practices for Syringe Service Programs, Currently, the

00058

County of Sanfa Cruz's policies are more restrictive and do not follow CDPH best practices. Attached ls a presentation that summarizes HSA's SSP operations for its SSP Advisory Group (Exhibit 7: SSP Presentation and SSP Advisory Group Participants, April 30, 2019).
The following recommendatlons to adhere to Publio Heallh Best Practices Were made to HSA, at the close of the April 30, 2019 Advisory Group meeling:
1. Improve SSP accessibility and availability by addressing current practices such as one-for-one exchange, limits on syringes per client per visit, limited hours and locations of service.
2. Increase the ability to maintain secondary syringe collection and distribution. Current practice limits secondary services due to stock on hand.
3. Ensure dedicated program funding and a staffing for a sustainable, high quality program
4. Improve information dissemination regarding current law (Health and Safety Code 121349.1) stating that individuals (n possession of syringes and associated materials necessary to prevent communicable disease shall not be subject to criminal prosecution.
5. Transition to needs based distribution from the current practice of one-for-one exchange and requiring a clihio visit for individuals without syringes to exchange.
6. Inorease access|bility and avallability of syringe disposal kiosks in outlying communities and in partnership with other municipalities.
7. Utilize the Citizen Connect application as a tool for the public to report syringe litter and track litter "hot spots" to more effectively deploy clean up resources.
8. Formalize the Advisory Board by developing a charter, by-laws, membership and öperations,
'The SSP continues to be transparent and post monthly reports with syringe distribution, disposal, and Informatlion on linkages for participants on the County website, www.santacruzhoalth.org/ssp.
Analysis
July 1, 2019 - June 30, 2021 Operational and Reporting Perlod: After almost six, years of directly operating the SSP, HSA will focus on sustaining practices (hat work and implementing changes that support best practices. Given the existing foundation for this program and the ongoing request to ensure high-quality implementation of the SSP, HSA proposes the foliowing measures to be implemented for the next two-year operational and reporting perlod:
á) Improve accessibility of this prögram by expanding SSP hours and locations. Attached is a CDO position paper that presents guidelines for preventing opioid overdose (Exhibit 8: CDC Evidence Based Strategies for Preventing Opioid Overdose, 2018). Accarding to the CDC (Exhibit 8), and an issue briet from CDPH (Exhibit 9: CDPH Issue Brief - Syringe Distribution Policies), Syringe Services Programs should be "low-barrier," meaning that the program should be easily accessible and user- friondly. The program's current practices have supported this by improving the client visifation space at the Emeline Jocation, providing minimal client data-entry requirements, and ensuring training for all SSP staff on providing respeotful care for the program's participants.
During this next operational period, HSA proposes to enhance accessibility of the program by expanding hours (not to exceed more than 20 hours per week) as staffing resources become available amongst the programs collaborating with SSP (Medically Assisted Treatment, Homeless Persons Health Project, and Integrafed Behavioral Health) to meet the needs of the community, and expanding access points outside of the HSA.Clinic locations through Homeless Persons Health Project clinícal field services,
These improvements align with requests contained in Finding #F6 of the Grand Jury Report (Exhibit. 1), which notes that sSP limited hours lead to less referrals to counseling, treatment and support programs, reducing thé number of peopfe receiving assistance; and align with Finding #F7 which

00059

notes that some injectlon drug users don't travel to SSP exchange sites, thus preventing them from receiving assistance from other health programs.
b) Improve access for safe disposal of syringes. Through continued partnership with DPW, working with local jurisdictions to install sharps kiosks in public locations, and expediting syringe disposal and improved tracking of syringe litter through the Citizen Connect applicatión, HSA will improve safe dispose of syringes.
HSA's SSP will continue to provide information and guidance to participants on safe and proper syringe disposal. The SSP will work with the community, including SSP participants, on identifying. areas where publicly available syringe kiosks are most needed, and will continue to partner with DPW and local organizafions for organized, continuous cleanup of syringe litter:
Additionally, HSA will incorporate syringe litter reporting through the existing Santa Cruz County Citizen Connect applilcation. This application already allows Santa Crüz, County residents to report environmental hazards such as potholes, illegal dumping and graffiti. HSA will leverage this existing tool to expedite syringe disposal and improve the tracking of syringe litter.
Lastly, upon Board approval, HSA will collaborate with CDPH to conduct a study of syrlnge liter in Sahta Cruz County to provide an assessment of local syringe litter issués to utilize for future planning efforts. These efforts will help address Recommendation #R7 in the Grant Jury Report and are in alignment with improvements noted as needed in Finding #F11.
Program and Cllent Statistics: The SSP continues to cojlect data of syringe distribution, syringe coilection, and linkages through the program. Reports are posted monthly on the. SSP website. Attached are consolidated biennial and annual data reports of client characteristics for the last two program years (Exhibit 10: HSA SSP Client Characteristic Data March 2017 through February 2019).
Data highlights for the period of March 2017 through February 2019 include;

'Note: Hepatitis C infection often causes little or no apparent illness at the time of infection, and often gões undiagnosed. The numbers shown here do not diiferentiate between newly acquired infections and infections that may have occurred as long as several decades ago, when infection rates were many times higher than today. Judging by nationwide estimates of newly acquired infection rates, the numbers shown here probably consist almost entirely of older, previously undiagnosed infections.
Enhanced Referrals and Medication Assisted Treatment: As of June 2017, per Board direction, the program discontinued authorizing Medical Exceptions. SSP facilitates a transfer to HSA. Clinie Services personnel for participants who do not have syfinges to exchange. From April 2018 to April 2019, SSP referred 71 participants to Emeline Clinic, of which, 64 were unduplicated patients and two left the clinic before being seen. In addition to syringes, the referred participants were interested in wound care. All these-patients received information and warm hand-off to a MÄT counselor, and alf were given follow-up appointments for a follow-up Clinic visit to establish care with a medical provider,
In 2017, HSA's SSP slarted distributing Naloxone to participants. Naloxone (a|so known as Narcan) is a medication that immediately reverses the effects of opioids, preventing death in someone whose breathing. has slowed or stopped due to opiold overdose. Natoxone can be given by nasal spray or injection by a lay persion with some basic fraining onits use. SSP staff provide an initial training for participants on proper use of Naloxone, and regularly check in with participants if they have questions or concerns. Most of HSA's SSP program participants have received the initial training to administer Nalaxone.

Program Expenditures: The CDPH Center for Infectlous Disease, Öffice of AIDS, has established a Syringe Exchange Supply Clearinghouse, a collaboration with the North American Syringe Exchange Network: (NASEN). The Supply Clearinghouse has provided a baseline level of supplies to authorized California syringe exchange programs (SEPs) for the purpose of enhancing the health and wellness of people who inject drugs and to increase the stabllity of California SEPs. Funds for the program, which were authorized by Section No. 14 .of California. Senate BIl 75 (2015) are ongoing and total $3 million annually statewide, administered by CDPH. Attached is. a list of CDPH requirements to recelve State funds for SSPs (Exhibit 11: CDPH Guidelines for SSP, July 2018). These CDPH Guidellnes include policies and procedures that align with Harm Reduction Principles• a set of strategies to reduce drug-related harm experlenced by individuals, families and communities, but do not require the drug uset to cease or modify their drug use prior to taking action to reduce harm.
As of September 2016, the SSP. began recelving SSP supply shipments directly, from NASEN. No funding reductions are anticipated from the new federal administration. The table below shows the NASEN award for. the past twa flsoal years.

FISCAL IMPLICATIONS
Reccipt of this report has no fiscal implications, as this is an informational report.
REASONS FOR RECOMMENDATION
The Needle Exchange Program reporting requirement established by Assombly Bill-(AB) 547 (Berg, Chapter 692, Statutes of 2005) requires that, in counties implementing a needle/syringe exchange program, the local public hiealth officer present annually : report detailing the status of the piogram, including any relevant statistics on blood bomne infections associated with needle sharing activity, at on open meeting of the Board of Supervisors. AB 110 (Laird, Ch, 707, Statutes of2007) amended the reporting requirement to include a report on the use of public funds for clean needle/syringe exchange programs. In 2011, AB 604 changed the minimum frequency of the reporting requirement to bicpnially.(1] However, annual reports haye continued to be submitted to ensure that the Board of Suporvisors and the community have timely, relevant information on the status of the NEX Program,
As the NEX Program may prevent HIV and viral hepatitis infections aiiong clients, their sex partners and their offspring - as well as proyiding an added benefit of decrcasing acute complications associated with infecting drugs such as skin abscesses and cardiovascular infections - this service is in line with County of Santa Clara Health System's Strategit Road Map Triple Aim Plus Objectives by reducing the burden of illness and cost of care and inereasing the number of healthy life years. It is also. aligned with the Public Health Deparlment's Strategic Priority to strengthen prevention and response to current and emerging infectious diseases. The NEX Program also supports the Getting to Zero initiative in climinating new HIV infections.

BACKGROUND AW DtO :

00064

Needie exchange or syringe access programs are one of a suite of'ovidence based HIV prevention Interventions that avert new HIV infections. Research supports the association of these programs with a reduction in HIV transmission among people who inject drugs (PWID) and demonstrates tey are cost-effectivo.121131 In addition to preventing HIV, necdle exchange programs also provent transmission of othor blopd bome pathogens such as hepatitis Band C viruses and can SRS

redtice the risk of other life-threatening infections of the skin, blood vessels and heart valves.
STATUS OF SPRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAM
Suminary
The County of Santa Clara's NEX Program, a function of the STD/HIY Prevention & Control Program within the Publio Health Department, is one of 50 authorized ncedle exchange programs in California, and is California's fourth longest oporating needlo exchango program, The prögram has been at the forefront of public health elforts to promote safer behaviors proyen to reduce now infections of' HIV and other blood borne infections.
Syringe access programs are community- or strect-based programs that provide sterile, umised necdles and other injection equipment to persons injecting drugs, hormones, steroids, vitamins, insulin, or other substances. Clients are encouraged to deliver used syringes when sterile syringcs are provided in order to promote safe disposal of used syringes as Well as access to safer injection equipment and other harm reduction resources.
NEX clients may be primary users (individuals exchanging their awn ncedles) or secondary users (individuals shose needles are exchanged for them by a primary user or othor client). Maferidls such as glcohol swabs are also provided ta hielp prevent abscesses and other bacterial infections due to injection. NEX also provides an opportunity to deliver, ofher services to this higli risk/underserved population who may not otherwise connect, with healthi care or social services. Such sórvices include three-site STD testing; HIV and Hepatitis C (HCV) testing and treatment referral; rosourcos for sexual and injection tisk reduction; referral to substance abuse counseling; and information regarding shölter, food services, targeted vaccination campaigns, and other health and social serviccs. NEX.Program staff have been oross-trained to provide-HIV, HCV and STD fosting and counseling at all cight needle exchange sites and to incorporate new training in opioid overdose prevention,
Rates of heroin and oploid use nationvide provide insight into the opioid epidemic and its origins. From 2006 through 2016, all United. States census regions experienced an indrease in the use of heroin in every demographic group, and a rise in opfoid related deaths. In 2016, a total of 15,469 lieroin-related deaths were rocorded, a 19 percent incrcase compared to the, year before,[4) In the samo time period, the regions that experionced the greatest increase in denths attributäble fo heroin and opioids were also those with the lowest income per capita, Heroin related admissions from 2005 thröugh 2015 were highest among persons ages 20 to 34, years, demonstrating the disproportionate impact of heroin use among the young adult population,[5) The Southwest border remains the principal enlry point of heroin and other opjoids into the United States.7a)
Paralleling national trends, Santa Clara County experienced an fncrcase of heroin and opioid use in recent years. Consequently, the NEX Program has-seen a substantial rise in the number of clients served at seyen out of its eight site locations. To account for this recent surge in number of clients served (a 27.1% increase from July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019), the NEX Program exfended its, hours af two site locations and implemented service expausion to further address. eltent needs. The service expansion included remodeling the mobile clinic facility that NEX staff directly operates to accomiodäte the provision of the Opioid Överdose Prevention Program (including the distribution! of Naloxóne) and HIV, HCV and STD testing. Due to the nature of activities that NEX clients engage in (e.g., injection drug use, potential sharing of syringes), they have a significantly higher risk of acquiring HIY, HCY and STDs compared to people who da hot Juject drugs:(7) This was a critical determinant in the decision to implement HIV, HCV and STD testing at all NEX sites.

Program and Client Statistics
Accordling to the 2018 National Suryey on Drug Use and Health, the lifetime prevalence of"ever" engaging in injection drug use (of cocaine, horoin and/or methamphctamine) was 1.6% among those aged 12 years and older: Applying these rates to Sonta Clara County's population yiclds a, rouigh estimate of 26,630 who have "ever" used injection drugs.18) Nationally, the estimated number of injection opioid users is rising stoadily, atfributed primarily to prescription opioid users who transition from oral and/or intranasal prescription opioid abuse to heroin injection.pormo) Additionally, in the county, 13 (7.8%) of the 167-new cases of HIV diagnosed in 2018 wore among people who were known to inject drugs, four (4, 2.4%) of whom had no other known risk factors for FIIV. For the addilional nine individuals, all were also known to be men who have sex with
men (MSM),

The anonymous nature of the NBX Program creates à number of challenges to capturing client data. However, the Public Fealth Department continues to make improvements in its ability to report unduplicated client counts and demographic information, with an eye to: monitoring if Santa Clara County has followed national trands of increased opioid use, especially among youth and young adults.

in Santa Clura County, the provalence of HBV infection is highest among Asian/Pacific Islanders. Approximatoly 1 in 12 Asians and Pacific Islanders arç estimated io have chronic HBV as comparod to l in 1,000 non-Hispanic whites nationaly. Among newly reported cases of chronic HBV in the County of Santa Clara whose rate/ethnicity was known (n=261), 77% were Asian/Pac|fic Islandors. Howover, Asiän/Pacific Islanders are underrepresented among NEX clients
as compared to other race/ethnicity groups. Other non-blood borne modes of transinission include mother to child transmission (e.g: transplacental, perinatal, and via breast milk), and via sexual transmission.[ia]
Hepatits C(HCY) in Santa Clara Countyl19)
In Santa Clara County, the estimated prevalence of past and current HOV infection amongr adults agés 18 and over is 1.7%:(25,736 cases).[20] Moreover, there sere 2,03 1 new cases of HCV reported between July I, 2018 and Juno 30, 2019 in the County (this figure inoludes individuals who were previously diagnosed with chroniç HCV).[21] Among individuals in the county who tested positive for HCV it the year 2018, a total of 1.0% éxhibitéd co-infection with HIV (this figure includes individuals who were previously diagnosed, with chronic HCV).(22] Among the 83" unduplicated clients who accessed needle exchange services during this period, a total of 6.1% (511) reported having a history of HCV and 6% (50) reported hoving a history of both HCV and HIV

RECENTACTIVITIES
Opioid Överdose Prevention Project
I: Backgromid
Drug related deaths are the lcading cause of injury mortality among US adults.(241 Opioid overdose deathis account for more than half of deaths among PWID.[25) Between 2000 and 2017,

00068

the rate of deaths from drug overdoses more than tripled, including.a five-fold increase in the rate of overdose deaths involving opiolds (opioid pain relievers und heroin),(26) (n 2017, a total of 70,237 drug overdose deaths occurred in the United States, representing a one-ycar inereaso of 10.4%, from 63,632 drug överdose deaths in 2016. Of drug overdose deaths that ocourred in 2017, 47,600 (67.8%) involved opiolds. The rate of drug overdöse deaths involving opioids in 2017 incrensed 12% from 2016.[27]
in 2018, 2,3 1l opioid oyerdose deaths were reported in Californla. Meanwhile, by September 2019, the Santa Clara County Medical Examiner's office had verified 59 deaths due to opioids within the County.[28)
Partioularly concering, low-income communities in Santa Clara County are experiencing the greatest losses attributable to the opioid epidemie, Tronds in opioid-rolated overdose deaths in the county indicate particularly high death rates among the geographica) regions of South-East San José and Gilroy(29], aréas thät also have the lowest median annual income per household. 304 The NEX Program continucs to serve the most impacted regions of the county with the greätest need, with three sitc locations in South-East and Enst San José, and one in Gilroy.
2. Naloxone Distribution
Optoid overdoses, including heroin, are particularly amenable to intervention: A safe and effective antagonist - naloxone hydrochloride - is available for use by lay responders, to reyerse the life- threatoping effecis of opioids during mn overdose. AB 635, passed in October 2013, is an expansiony of prevíous Naloxone-related iegislation in Califomia, allowing for the prescription and distribution of Naloxone throughout the State. Senate Bill (SB) 833 (Chapter 30, Statutes of 2016) requires CDPH, subject to an annual appropriation, to award funding to local health departments to support or establish programs that provide Naloxone ta Gitsi responders and to at-risk opioid users through programs that serve at-risk drug users, including, but not limited to, syringe exchango and disposal programs, liomeless programs and substance use disorder freatment proyiders. A total of $3 million yas allocaled on a ope-time basis to support this program. CDPH has designated $47,900 for Naloxone nasal spray (purchased medication sont ta the jurisdiction) to the County of Santa Clara Public Health Department, which was thew distribuied both by NEX and through collaboration with other County prögrams.
Qn August 29, 2016, the NEX Program implomented the Opiold Overdose Prevention Program tó meet the needs of its clients at high risk for an opioid-related death and/or allow them to bocome uniquely positioned to respond to and reverse an overdose. NEX Programt staff provide olients with traïning on recognizing an ovordose, calling for emergency nedical response and caring for someone experiencing an overdose until help arrives. Clients then receivo Opioid Överdose Prevention kits that include Näloxone to help reverse the ife-threatening effects of opioids, and they receive instructions ón safe administration of the medication in accordance with law. From January 1, 2019 through July 30, 2019, a total of 280 opioid overdose kits were disseminated to clients, 96 (34,3%) of which were distributed as the initial startor pack, 68 (24,3%) of which were distributed as refills and 116 (41.4%) of which were distributed due to loss. NEX Program data convey, an increasingly high demand för opioid overdose prevention services, inctuding overdose recognition fraining and distribution of Naloxone.[31] This froquency of use is consistent with the experience of other opioid ovordose prevention programs.[32)
The efficacy of the NEX Program's Opioid Overdose Prevention Program can be assessed in revicwing the recent decrease in opfoid-relatod overdose deaths in Santa Clara County. Since the program's implementation in 2016, the county hds sceh ä steady decease in opioid-related overdose deaths. in Calondar Year (CY) 2016, a total of 68 doaths aitributable-to overdose were recorded in the county (a 5-year high. in the County between CY 2014 and CY 2018). This number declinied in CY 2017 (67 recorded deaths attributablaito overdose) and CY 2018 (59 recorded deaths AOM atiributable to overdose).[33] This timely decrease demonstrates the effectiveness of NEX's Öpioid. Overdose Prevention Program in holping educate clients on overdose, preyention methods and reduce the number of opioid-rolated overdose deaths in the County of Santa Clara.
3. Fentanyl Testing Strips Distribution
An added risk-to those using drugs is the relatively recent:finding of opioid and nop-opioid street reduca drugs laced with the consequences of intended aud unintended fontanyl exposure, the fentanyl, a synhetic opioid 50-100 times more potent than morphine. In ordor fo County of Sania Clara AORNE

00069

Public Health Department established guidelines for the distribution of fentanyl drug test strips through the NEX Program. Clients are given instructions on the use of fentanyl testing strips and DE harm reduction odlucation, especially pertaining to use of substances in which fontanyl is prosont. Upon provision of testing strips, ollents are requested to return to the NBX site tò fill ouf a voluotary, anonymous survey detailing their findings. On August 7, 2018, the NEX Program began distribution of fentanyl testing strips for oltents using syringe access services who were interested in testing their drugs for the presence of fentanyl, In FY 2019, the NEX Program distributed over
250 testing kits to clients.
4. Parmering Stakeholders
The NEX Program staNf'work with and are an active participant in the. larger opioid o verdose and injection drug use provention programming efforts with the Santa Clara County Opioid Overdöso Prevention Coalition (SCCOQP) led by County of Santa Clara Behavioral Health.
Community partners involved in SCCOOP coalition offorts include Stanford Hospital, Vèterans' Affairs (VA), County óf Santa Clara Hcalth System, Valley Homeless Hcalthcare Program (VHHP), County of Santa Clara Public Health Department (SCCPHD), County of Santa Clara Department of Correction, County of Santa Clara Office of the District Attorney, County of Santa Clara Probation Department and San José Public Library. Actfvitics and projects that are currently being implemented by the coalition encompass opioid awareness and education cvents, oxpanding freatment access, extending medicationi assisted treatment (MAT) opportunities and serviccs to
youth, piloting the introductión of mobile MAT teams to emergency departments, and inercasing the capacity of jail services to include suboxone and Naloxone distribution.
5. Moblle HIV/HCVISTD Testing & Field Delivered Therapy
Mobile STD testing was intograted into existing NEX services beginning in 2018, such that clienis.
are now offered testing, for chlamydja and gonorled at the lime of receiving sytinge access and other related services. Currently, all' eight NEX sites offer STD festing. For chlamydia and gonoirheä testing, once clients consent to-test and provide a brief sexual history, those who meet criteria for sereening are prompted to use the restroom on the mobile unit to collect their own
pharyngeal, rectal, vaginal, and/or urine specimens.
Individuals. who have tested positive for any sexually transmitted infection will be contacted by staff for follow-up at the Crane Center. If the client is unwilling or unable-to seek medical evaluation at the Crane Centor or from a primary medical care provider, Field Delivered Themapy (FDT) will be offered in accordance with existing pharmacy policios and proçedures, The client will also be offered Patient Delivered Portner Therapy (PDPT), using "Partnet Packs" to distribute. approprinte medications and safely information to partners who may have been expösed to.sexually
.transinitted infections.
Since inception in February 2018, the program has tested 12 individuals, yielding four (4) positiye tests. With funding from the CDPH Office of AIDS (OA), much ofthe testing during the fiscal
year was interrupted with modifications made to-the NEX mobilo unit to better facllitäte STD
testing services.
FUTURE DEFELOPMENT
The California Dopartment of Public Health Stafe Office of AIDS recently supported the NEX Prógram's desire to build team cohesion, ongoing training and documentation of operations. The crcation of an annual needs assessment to determine and prioritize community needs and improve program design was emphasized through the hiring of a consultant during FY 2018. In continuation of this focus, updating and reyising protocols for standard operating procedures in order to further inect the evolving needs of both NEX Program clients and staff was prioritized.
CONSEQUENCES OL NEGATIVE ACTION
Failure to receivo the report may impact the County's ability to comply with Section 121349.3 of the California Health and Safety Cöde.

Syringe Exchange Program
Published on December 22, 2016. Last modified on December 07 2019
Syrings exchange is a publio health intervention which is proven to reduce the transmission of bloodborne pathogens like: HIV and hepatitis C in the community, Syringe exchange programs work by providing people who cannot or will not stop injecting illegal drugs with new syringes and a place to safely dispose of used syringes. In addition, syringe exchange programs serve as a point of access to health education and other physiçal and mental health services. They provide a wide range of services in addition to syringe exchange and disposal. These services include HIV and hepatitis C testing, overdose prevention training, free naloxone distribution, and referrals to drug treatment, housing, and mental health services: They also provide first aid and basic supplies.

Sharper Solutions
A Sticky Situation That Won't Go Away

p•.g. dmtd....mm.e'e . +9 1-g- . **

The increase of illegal injection drug use and the notable rise in discarded syringes has Summary

many in Santa Cruz County uneasy. In 2013, Santa Cruz County started a syringe exchange program to address this issue. Howeyer, questions still remain about the mission of the Syringe Services Prögräm (SSP), as public perception is often misguided and misunderstood. In an effort to understand these issues, the Grand Jury investigated the pöllcies and procedures of the S8P and the effects of their implementation.
A läck of transparency between the SSP and the public has created an atmosphere of distrust. Even more important, inadequate funding for drug rehabllitation and services is responsible for the unfulfilled promises of the SSP.

Background
The earliest record of opium drug use dates as far back as 5000 BC in® the Sumerlan community located in present day Iran and Iraq. Societies worldwide continue. to fight substance abuse in various punitive ways including the death penalty. Sadly, drug abuse continues in spite of these often disturbing consequences,
Iñ 1989, Santa Cruz Syringe Access Program,() a community volunteer group, set out to curb the spread of HIV, AIDs, and Hepatitis C. They offered free needle exchangè in a building on Paoifio Avenue where they also provided counseling, drug treatmönt information, outreach resources, HIV testing, and free condoms. The program also sponsored Sharps containers in publio bathrooms. After losing their bullding they acquired a van as a means to continue their needle exchange services.
In 2011, the California State Assembly passed AB604 authorizing citles and counties to conduct a clean needle and syringe exchange project/21 On April 30, 2013, the Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency (HSA) implemented the Syringe Services Program (SSP). The purpose of the SSP is to reduce the damage associated with using unsterile injection equipment, to offer counseling and rehabilitation services, and to address the community's concern about improperly discarded syringes. Policies and procedures were established along with the creation of an advisory board made up-of stakeholders including health staff, law enforcement, mental health workers, rehabilitation personnel, and. city and county staff.
Since the inception of the program, there have been numerous media reports and citizen complaints about found needjes and accidental needle sticks in Santa Cruz County. In addition, the public has expressed concorns about a lack of communication and transparency by county agencles.
Scope
The Grand Jury examined the SSP by reviewing its policies and procedures.ta) In addition, numerous Interviews were conducted with the County Health Services Agency, law enforcement, a community organization, and individuals struggling with the challenges of illegal infection drug use...An on-site tour was conducted of the needle exchange clinic on Emeline Street during off-hours.
Investigation
SSP Policy and Procedures require an advisory group to assist with the program's implementation, to review reports, and to meet regularly to monitor the program.Wl The current advisory group is composed of city and county employees. as well as those working in the drug and rehabilitation community. They hold meetings that are not open to the public. The $SP provides several statistical reports on its webslte and has a link a to a comment form, but without public meetings there is no avenue for dialog. We found distrust and confusion by the general public due to the lack of information provided by the SSP. The advisory group should also inolude members of the general public, including at least one rehabilitated injection drug user, which would provide both greater

Published on June 27, 2017 Page 2 of 7

00078

transparency of the program and insight into the day-to-day challenges of the injection
drug user community.
The SSP uses a three-pronged approach to prevent the spread of deadly and costly communicable diseases. The first is to operate the county needle exchange sites and explore future expansion for more sitès, either fixed or mobile. The second is to work with the community's concerns regarding used syringes and diug paraphernalia found on streets, beaches, publie parks, residential neighborhoods, and encampments. The third is to provide clients with a variety of medical treatments, services and rehabilitation
programs.
The SSP, run by dedicated professionals from the HSA, operates without a budget or permanent $taff. Staff are pulled from HSA Clinic Services and other public hèalth divisions, providing temporary personnel. Frequent rotation of staff makös it diffioult to
develop rapport and trust with clients. This creates yet anothor challenge to transitioning olients into rehabilitation, and as a consequence the SSP is unable to meet their goals.
The SSP offers two walk-in sites, one in Santa Cruz and the other in Watsonville, with different hours and days of operation. The Santa Cruz exchange site is available on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday for a total a of 10 hours per week, while the Watsonyille síte is open Monday through Thursday for a total of 5 hours per week. During a Emeline clinic visit we found the closet-sized exchange room to be á cramped, windowless, confined space of approximately 50 square feet. During use, this office must accommodate the client and medical staff, as well as various supplies and equipment that is shared with other departments, There are additional challenges of dealing with cliants' personal belongings and Sharps containers: in this limited space.
There is controversy about whether the policy of a one-to-one needle exchange is ourrently being enforced. Our investigation revealed thiat this pollcy is inherently difficult, if not impossible, to enforce. To Increase the safety of staff and clients, staff are instructed to never touch used injection equipment or the containers they arrive in. As a result, they are unable to ascertain the exact number of syringes retumned by a participant and must rely on a visual esfimate.
The Policy and Procedures provide that a client on their initial visit may receive up to fifteen syringes regardless if they have any to exchange. Subsequent syringe exchanges by the same participant could fall under a predefined medical exception which allows up to fifteen extra syringes per exchange. !5l These exceptions, verified by a needs assessment by staff, are:
A. known or self-disclosed HIV or Hepätitis G client A.client with a partner knöwn to have HIV or Hepatitis C A client with evidence or history of skin abscessés
A sex wörker
A person with a known mental illness
Further exceptions may be authorized by the County. Health Officer.
Because some clients are unable to travel to either site, the Policy and Procedures allows for needle exchanges on behalf of others. These exchanges are limited to 100

Published on June 27, 2017 Page 3 of 7

00079

syringes per vlsit, unless approved by the County Health Officer. Documentation is required by SSP staff when an exchange exceeds the number of syringes the agengy is
authorized to distribute per their policy.
Community members continue to voice their concern regarding illegally disposed syringes and the county's apparent inability to implement an effactive collection program. Acoording to those who track this data, there have been over 13,000 syringesl reported found since April 30, 2013. It should be noted that not all syringes are from the SSP. During interviews with five admitted illegal injection drug users, four were unaware of the needle exchange program.. When asked how they disposed of their needles, some said they deposited them in the garbage or flushed them down toilets. What to do if a syringe is found? The county and cities do not post signage with a contact number for those that find hazardous waste including syringes. The SSP has a section on its webpage for directing the public to agencies that will retrieve and properly dispose of syringes; however, this information is very confusing as it lists nine different contacts, and which to use depends on where a syringe is found. There are currently only three kioske throughout the county for the collection of used syringes: 701 Ocean St., Santa Cruz, 1080 Emeline St., Santa Cruz, and 9 Crestview Dr., Watsonville. Syringes may be from both the legal use of injected medicatlon for both humans and animals as well as illegal injection drug üse. All pharmacies within the county will collect used syringes. For some, it is not worth exchanging at the SSP sites as some pharmacies and online providers will sell syringes. without a prescription.
The Santa Cruz Gounty HSA Syringe Services Program (SSP) is pärt of the three-pronged approach framework to prevent the spread of costly and deadly communicable diseases and address the community's concern regarding used syringes and trash being found on streets, beaches and encampments as well as illegal drug activities. SSP Policy and Proceduresl

H$A staff and some community members. substantially disagree on how concerns about improperly discarded syringes are being addressed. A citizens' organization has been formed in recent years to assist with communicating publio concerns regarding the increasing amount of found syringes and associated paraphernalia they believe are. a direct result of the SSP. Complaints have been received by both the HSA and the Board of Supervisors regarding these concerns. However, other than an annually scheduled community clean-up day and three kiosks placed throughout the county, we can find no other HSA or county initiated clean-up effort instituted since the inception of the program. Further, we were unable to locate information in any progress reports, or annuat or biennial report with regard to specific HSA initiated clean-up efforts.
The SSP 2013 90-Day Progress Reportie) and 20.14 Annual Report of the SSP ul state:
The County has expanded oleanup efforts to alleviäte the problem of improperly discarded syringes. The dleanup is a combined effort

between HSA, Environmental Health, the Department of Public Works, the Sheriff's Departmont and the City of Santa Cruz.

While it does not have a standalone budget, the Syringe Services Program (SSP) is overseen by the Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency (HSA) administration and embedded within the clinic setting at HSA. With financial assistance form the State, the Courty provides safe, clean needles to injection drug users. This objective, along with

the current structure. other program principles such as the one-to-one needle exchange, are being met under

However, the Board s committed to improving operations, and there are new funding opportunities at hand, Congress recently lifted the federal ban on funding för needle exchange operatíons, creating. potential funding opportunities for SSP. HSA will continue exploring outside funding sources with hopes of securing grants for this program in the future. The County also expects President Trump's recent announcement that he will declare the oploid epidemic a national omergency will free up further resources. The Board recently approved a Whole Person Care (WPC) Pilot grant program that provides funding for individuals with mental illness, substance use disorder, and other health conditions who are homeless or are at risk for homelessness, The Board also understands HSA will pursue funding through future Drug Medl-Cal expansion and other resources to enhance SSP operations.

Recommendations
R4. The Board of Supervisors should allocate funds for a permanent budget for the SSP to function as mandated per SSP Policy and Procedures. (F4)
HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED - summarize what has been done
HAS NOT BEEN IMPLEMENTED BUT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN THE
FUTURE - summarize what will be done and the timeframe
X REQUIRES FURTHER ANALYSIS - explain scope and timeframe (not to exceed six months)
WILL. NOT BE IMPLEMENTED - explain why
Response explanation, summary, and timeframe:

As noted above, there are now and probable funding opportunities available for needle exchange. programs and to support intravenous drug users on their path toward recovery that did not exist when the County assumed administration of the program in 2013. The Board believes it necessary to evaluate these opportunities before committing scarce general fund dollars to the program.
The Trump Administration signaled it would declare a national emergency for the opioid
epidemic in early August. More time is needed to understand the significance of this move, which appears to be unprecedented. There are likely two avenues to declare a national emergency: the Stafford Act or the Public Health Service Act. In particular, the latter could be utilized to deploy medical staff in underserved araas. At this point, it.is too early to say how such a declaration could impact our county.
Furthermore, Whole Person Care and the Drug Medi-Cal expansion are new programs which must be established before we fully understand how they could support the SSP.

Response explanation, summary, and timeframe:
As noted in HSA's response, the agency has worked with a number of groups to train more clinicians in medicatión assisted treatment (MAT) and counseling. SSP staff are linking clients to drug treatment, medical and behavioral health services.
However, due to the limited rehabilitation and counseling options in Santa Cruz County, our outreach efforts will go for naught without increasing local treatment and rehabilitatión options, The Board is committed to that achieving that goal through the expansion of County medical Infrastructure, Whole Person Care, the Drug Medi-Cal
expansion and other grant programs.

Should the SSP Advisory Group recommend that we re-establish a mobile exchange a program, the Board would consider that recommendation with input from stakeholders, public safety officials, medical experts and the communlty.

Under Board direction, SSP staff are working with local jurisdjctions to identify and install additional public sharps disposal access points in the areas where syringes are commonly found. Sharps containers will be installed with appropriate signage, contact and program information.
While the Board supports the safe, proper disposal of discarded needies, locating signage in highly effective areas requires the cooperation of our partner jurisdictions.

Response explanation, summary, and timeframe:
As previously stated, the Board supports the safe, proper disposal of discarded needles. The Board approved one of the first provider responsibility laws in the U.S. aimed at reclaiming used needles. The City of Santa Cruz and other jurisdictions followed suit, and there are now dozens of needle collection sites throughout Santa Cruz County. (see http://sharpmedsolutions.org/collection_sites/index.html).
While the County has no jurisdiction over public bathrooms on private property, we continue working with partner jurisdictions to identify additional collection sites throughout the County. Public bathrooms would likely be a focus of those discussions.

Response explanation, summary, and timeframe: As previously noted by the Grand Jury, the operations of the SSP. are absorbed jn HSA's budget and the program itself has no full-time staff. A number of community- based cleanup events do dcour, and some, such as regular beach cleanups, do receive County funding. In addition, local law enforcement agencies regularly address illegal homeless encampments, at which numerous needles are often found. Assuming control over those cleanups raises funding, coordination, jurisdiotional and safety issues, and requires further analysis.

AGREE
PARTIALLY DISAGREE - explain the disputed portion X. DISAGREE - explain why
Response explanation (required for a response other than Agree):
The Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency (HSA) has been very responsive to public input, In April 2013, through HSA's commitment to community engagement and listening to public stakeholder's input, HSA began directly administering the Syringe Services Program (SSP).
Sínce inception of the SSP, HSA convened and staffed an SSP Advisory Group. While not a rèquirement of state legislature, HSA identified the need and value of convening a group of community representatives including law enforcement, County Probation, City of Santa Cruz executive management, community pharmacy representatives, California Department of Public Health (CDPH), physiclans, community based organizations serving Injection drug users and other subjeot matter experts to help guide the process and mitigate any unintended consequences of operating a syringe services program.
Now that HSA is in Phase 3 of the SSP program, additional members will be welcomed in order to broaden the community perspective. Inviting residents, espocially thöse impacted by addiction, will expand the perspective of the SSP Advisory Group.

SSP leadership and staff have mäde every effort tq talk to the public via email, phone, and face-to-face meetings and through the online dialogue feature of the SSP webpäge. Through Facebook and other social media outlets, the SSP stays engaged in public discussion, education and uses the afprementioned outlets as a way to notify the public about important meetings, reports, and news related tò the SSP. In 2016, HSA convered 11 countywide community health dialogues in which SSP was a regular topic of discussion.
In 2013, 2015 and 2017, the SSP presented annual reports tö the Board of Supervisors under Brown Act rules and open meeting policies in order ta assure public participation and voice of the community,
Poor communication and laok of transparency are not characteristic of the SSP

Response explanation (required for a rasponse other than Agree):
As authorized by the Board of Supervisors, the SSP adherès to a one-for-one policy. The number of used syringes being returned for exchange for new syringes is confirmed both by visual inspection as well as reviewing the database to see how many syringes the olient received at their prior Vislt. Asking staff or clients to physically count and handle syringes would place staff at risk and be in violation of one of the primary goals of the program, which is to prevent the spread of infectious disease.
In order to participate in the state Syringe Exchange Program (SEP) Cleäringhouse, all SEPs must adhere to California Department of Publio-Health/Office of AIDS (CDPH/OA) guidelines for safe handling of sharps waste.

Response explanation, summary, and timeframe:
The SSP program has been working with a number of groups, including Janus and the safety net clinics, in order to train more olinioians in medication assisted treatment (MAT) and counseling.
SSP olients currently have limited options for rehabilitation and counseling. Through newly acquired grants and increased collaboration between Behavioral Health, Clinics and the Homeless Person's Health Project. (HPHP), SSP clients have experienced the
1 benefit of increased access to services such as counseling and drug treatment services specifically, MAT. Currently SSP is staffed by a Public Health Nurse from HPHP and a case manager from the MAT grant program. These oritical staff are able to link alients to drug treatment, medical and benavioral health services and provide an Increased level of continuity.
HSA will continue to monitor and apply for grant funds that become available in response to the national oplold epidemic prioritizing SSP support services as a primary area of funding. With additional funds, SSP plans to provide more comprehensive services to SSP clients.

TO: TBSC Needles Solutions Team
VIA: needlessolutions@gmail.com
RE: Opposition to the application of a local "harm reduction group"
To whom it concerns,
As Executive Director of Save Our Shores, I am writing in opposition to a local group organizing under the moniker "the Harm Reduction Group" whose goes is to increase distribution of
syringes in Santa Cruz. We particularly oppose increased needle distributions at the existing "Ross Camp," but also at any other location where significant numbers of homeless drug users who mäy also be in need of mental health care currently congregate or may congregate in
sanctioned or unsanctioned "camps.'

Save Our Shores is weighing in on this issue because of our concern re: the exceptionally high number of needles we have found on our local beaches this winter season. While the largest
volume of needles we've found have been in locations adjacent to the outflow of rivers and
creeks, we have also been finding needles on beaches where we have not typically found them in past years. This suggests, in addition to the Increased numbers we are finding on beaches like Seäbright where the San Lorenzo joins the Monterey Bay, some needles are being swept out into the open Bay before we are able to collect them and then washing back ashore in another
location.

To be clear, we agree that a needle exchange program can help reduce the spread of disease and we are certainly in favor of that, However, we älso firmly believe that such exchange programs must be operated by professional, licensed health care service pröviders such as Santa Cruz County's Health Services Agency. We understand this agency is already running a needle exchange program and operating the program in compliance with local government oversight and controls. Therefore, we see no rationale for approval of an additional volunteer program, which may not be subject to the same accountability as the approved health agency.
Incréased needle distribution is not in the best interest of anyone. We urge the Santa Cruz
Board of Supervisors to unequivocally deny the Harm Reduction Group's application.

Sincerely,
Karknne DiA
Katherine O'Dea,
Executive Directly

Doscription of Services:
Harm Reduction Road Show is focused on public health outreach, emphasizing HIV and Hepatitis C prevention among high risk, underserved populations. We do this by providing specific support services to pcople practicing high, risk behaviors. These services are all free, confidential and anonymous. All of our services are organized and will be provided by trained, volunteers. While we currently have no paid staff and we have an offer from a local non profit to act as fiscal sponsor and allow us to seek donations and grant funding. (United Services Agency 501c3)

Our services will include:

Mobile syringe exchänge provides free, confidential, anonymous access to sate injecting
supplies in a non judgmental harm reduction model. The supplies include; access to sterile
syringes and other safe injecting supplies shich arc otherwise not widely available. Our success
is built on trust and consistendy in providing servico, We arrive at specific locations on a
predictable and regular basis.
Syringe disposal is a free service for anyone with syringe. Cutrently our county has only three
anonymous kiosks, and several pharmacies particlpate in syringe disposal in part because. of our
robust Extended Producers Responsibility Ordinance. The purpose is to keep used syringes off
the streets and out of trash cans where they can cause accidental sticks.
We will provide free intranasal and/or injectable naloxone to distribute among the drug using
community.
We will provide fentanyl test. strips to empower people who use drugs with information
regarding their drug supply that will enable them to make decisions about safety while using (to
not use alone, to make sure naloxone is available, to yse a smaller amount and use more slowly,
to inform their community that fentanyl may be present)
Frce condoms for any person: Unprotected sex is high risk behavior which can bè a concern,
HIV testing to anyone: We will refer to agoncies that provide free anonymous testing and we
will invite Santa Cruz AIDS Project staff to join us in outreach to offer free testing.
Referrals: we provide referrals to various social welfare programs, including but not limited to;
food, shelter, clothes, health access, legal assistance, and substance use disorder treatment and
MAT programs.
We have volunteers that go out into the community and talk to people about our services and
make other referrals. We will give out various supplies including, socks, soap shampoo,
conditioner, razors, and Ilterature to people who might otherwise not have access to these items.

00124

Section VI

A. Syringe Dispensing Plan
Tho syringe transactión model will be a needs based/ negotiated distribution, model. The client and voluntcer will determine how many syringes will be distributed based on the number of individuals he or she is supporting with clcan equipment, the number of times per day supplies are needed and the individual's ability to visit any of the syringe access mobile or fixed sites. (once a week, once a month, every two weeks etc.)
All clients are urged to retur used syringes and dispose of them properly with us or the County Health Services Syringe Services Program utilizing sharps containers, kiosks or pharmacy drop offs. Clients are urged to reduce the risk of needle stick to others by not disposing in a garbage can or improperly leaving syringes in bathrooms or other areas where they may inject.
There will not be a limit on the number of syringes provided as the goal is to meet the U.S. Püblic: Health Service recommendation of having a now sterile syringe for cach injection.
We will provide safe injectlon supplies such üs cookers, cotton, water, alcohol wipes, and tourniquets as tecommended to prevent sharing and cross contamination, which can lead to diseáse transmission. Clients will be instructed on the need for proper disposal of the above supplies,
The number of syringes dispensed is a reporting requirement to the California Department of Public Health/Office of AIDS on a biannual basis.

B. Syringe colfection and disposal plan

A. All staff/volunteers are expected to follow the Sharps Waste Management Plan
for the disposal of sharps and other potentially infectious material generated in
the Syringe: Exchange Program.
B. All sharps are to be placed in a sharps container labeled with the word
"Biohazard" and the international biohazard symbol.
C. The sharps container will be arigid puncture-resístant container which when sealed is leak resistant and cannot be reopened without great difficulty.
D. During Syringe Access and Disposal Program transactions, sharps containers
should'be placed between the participant and staff/volunteers. Staff/volunteers
should never hold the sharps container duringan exchange; the container should

00125

beplaced on a secure table, and should be kept level at alltimes.
E. Any injectionequipment that falls putside of the sharps container should be retrievedby the participant and placed in the sbarps container. If this is not
possible, staff/volunteersshouldusetongs to retrieve the injection equipment.
F. Sharps containers should never be filled beyond the manufacturer's fill line; the
container should never be more than 75% full. Staff/volunteers should nöt
insert their hands into the sharps container or forcibly push used injection
equipment down into the container.
G. All needles and syringes shall be kept and transported in puncture proof
containers designed specifically for this purpose.
The Santa Cruz. Public Health Agency has an existingcontract with "Sharps Solutions" to dispose
of sharps waste in a manner that is compliant with existing regulations. Depending on
the amount collected, other contractors may be sought out to reduce the cost of proper
disposal.

C. Service delivery plan
Fixed Site and Mobite. We have determined a need for mobile services in two locations in Santa Cruz and Felton, In addition, we will provide fixed site services at the Salvation Army day services center in Watsonville as well as one mobile site in Watsonville. The Harm Reduction Road Show recognizes that geographic, transportation, physical limitations in mobility, work schedules and other bartiers exist to accessing Harm Reduction supplies.

Description of service loçations:
1.Santa Cruz area bounded by Coral Street and Harvey West Boulevard,
northbound to Limekiln Street, and turning right on Coral Street to River Street.
Sundays:7:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.
2.Felton. -- area bounded by CA-9 and Plateau Drive north to Graham Hill Road, east on Covered Bridge South Road Thursdays 10:30 a.m, to 12:00 p.m.
3.Watsonvllle - Salvation Army, 214 Union Street, Watsonyille, CA 95076. Mondays 9:00 a.m, to 11:00 a;m,

00126.

4.Watsonville - San Juan Road and Porter Road east to Salinas Road, south to Stender Avenue, north to San Juan Road. Mondays 1:30 p.m. to 3:00 p.m.

Staff and Volunteer Training
a) The staff/volunteers.complete core education on the Syringe Access and Disposal Program prior to providing services. Thus far we have 15 volunteers actively available to attend mobile outreach, some of whom have volunteered or worked at the County Syringe Service Program. We can hope to offer pay as we fundraise and grow. Volunteer burnout is something we want to prevent, We have à fiscal sponsor that has volunteered to let us wörk under their non profit. The United Services Association ( Paul Lee and Herb Schmidt)

The basic topics included in the education are as follows:

1. Comprehensive education on the program standard operating procedures; Syringe Dispensing Plan, Syringe Collection and Sharps Waste Disposal Plan, and

Needle exchange has bigger issues

There has been a lot in the news lately about needles. If you have not heard, there.
is a new coalition that has applled to the State Department of Public Health to
distribute needles to support individuals suffering from substance disorders at
three lócations in Santa Cruz County.
The "Harm Reduction Coalition of Santa Cruz Counfy, Harm Reduction
Roadshow" proposes to offer mobile services in Santa Cruz, Felton and
Watsonville, and at a fixed site in Watsonville. I understand that providing clean
needles to these individuals may help them and also reduce the transmission of
diseases. This is a worthwhile goal and I believe the proponents of this program
have good intentions.
However, the story does not stop there.
The coalition had the option of applying to logal governments, but chose to apply
to the state instead. This means that the decilsion to approve or not approve the
unlimited distribution of needles will be made in.Sacramento rather than in Santa
Cruz County, with less Jocal community discussion and outreach.

9/15/2020 Needle exchange has bigger Issues [ Mayor's message - Santa Cruz Sentlinel :
Many Scotts Valley and San Lorenzo Valley residents. are concerned because of
news stories about the unsafe disposal of large numbers of needles, beçause
there has been little community outreach, because of reglonal tourism Impacts,
and because one location has been proposed for the Felton Covered Bridge Park
where childreri play. Communily members have raised safety concerns about
public health impacts and safety Issues for children who may be exposed to
needle use in public restrooms and ta dirty needies littering the grounds of the
park.

In addition, questions have been rajsed by residents about oversight and the level
of qualifed medical and mental health professionals involved in the program.
While a true needle exchange program does have value because it reduces the
spread of disease befween needle users and protects thö public health, this
proposed program would harm the public because it appears that there would be
no requirement or incentive to furn In used needles in exchange for inew needles: |
belleve in helping those who need help in a thoughtful and organized manner, with
the goat of protecting everyone in the community. This proposed program does not
meet that standard. Instead, the proposal threatens the environment and the
safety of community members.

As mentioned, above, the tourism industry is an important part of our local
aconomy. We need to protect our environment, tourism industry and public safety
by nurturing healthy communities.

A We also need to take care of these vulnerable residents in a manner that requires
them to be part of the solution in exohange for the assistance that they receive,
We should have community programs that adhere to common-sense expectations
like safely disposing of dirty needles.
The Scotts Valley City Councll directed our city manager to submit a letter to the
state objacting to this proposed program. I encourage everyone who cares about
public health and safety to submit comments concerning the Harm Reduction
Coalition of Santa Cruz County, Harm Reduction Roadshow to the State at
SEPApplication@cdph.ca.gov or-sign the petition at.http://chng.it/8bL.455BnSc by
May 24. Let's create programs that protect the entire community and Improve our
neighborhoods.

Mayor's message is a Sunday column by Scotts Valley Mayor Jack Dilles,
Watsonville Mayor Francisco Estrada, Santa Cruz Mayor Martine Watkins and
Capitola Mayor Jacques Bertrand.

once-a-week services in Santa Cruz's Harvey West neighborhood, Felton's Covered Bridge
Park, a triangular area south of San Juan Road in -Pajaro and at a fixed site at the Salvation
Army in Watsonville, though the Salvation Army's Capt. Harold Laubach Jr. has denied on
social media his approval of the group's use of his site.

in the latest program denouncement, the City Council voted Wednesday to send a letter tó the
Department of Public Health in opposition of the program's certification and authorized Police
Chief Steve Walpole to do the same. The city joins law enforcement and elected officials from
across the county. Councilman Jim Reed, who requested the item be put on last week's
agenda, said studies show lives are saved "If you've got a well-regulated needte exchange
program where they have access to services, where they can get counseling, hopefully get
treated for their addiction." The proposed mobile program, ho said, was not that.
According to its stata certifioation application, the Harm Reduction. Road Show will provide
sterile syringes In addition to syringe disposal and education on proper disposal practices;
overdose prevention and naloxone distribution; harm reduction and first aid supplies, referrals.
to HIVHGV testing, vaccinations, substance use disorder treatment and services for people
experiencing hometessness.
Vice Mayor Randy Johnson joined his council peers in raising concerns about the program's
naming of the Felton Covered Bridge County Park as à site for needle distribution, saying he
feared that needte giveaways amount to "almost like tacit approval," compared to putting more
funding "into a positive resolution and treatment."
"f you have a problem with alcoho), we don't send around a beverage cart with Jäck Daniels
minis or something like that to help out, because that doesh't benefit them," Johnson said.
Mayor Jäck Dilles said he belleved proponents of the mobile program desired to help those
struggling with drug addiction but critiqued the group's method of moving forward, Scotts Valley
and neighboririg Felton want to "project a wholesome healthy image and grow our tourism and
not shoot ourselves in the foot,* he said.
"I looked at the rules online, and this could be a local decision. This group has the optión of
applying ölther through local jurisdictions, city councils or supervisors or to the state," Dilles said. "And they chose tö go to. the state. And I think this shöuld be more of a local discussion
and decision so we have more local control."

First-hand experience

Scotts Valley resident Sharon de Jong also has been among those vocal in her concerns about
the mobile program's organization. She wrote a letter to council members, asking them to take
a stance on the budding effört,

00134

An addict In recovery who has been clean for more than 2/ years, de Jong saia sne supports
sterile syringe programs with connected health, treatment and counseling services, but is
"terilfied" about a program secondary to the county-run Syringe Services Program, She's
particularly worrled that the grassroots program's efforts to ensure that those receiving the
neédlés are at least 18 years old may not be as stringent as the county's. Ideally, de Jong said,
the public outcry will put a "pause button" on the Harm Röduction Road Show, deralling efforts
to "normalize the drug lifestyle."
"You don't need a prescription to buy syringes, you cari go in - they're 50 cents. If the guy's got enough money and enough wherewithal tó go meet his dope dealer a quarter mile away,
they've got the wherewithal to walk into Walgreens and buy syringes, too," de. Jong said.
"Some peopfo might say, well, that's shameful and stigmatizing. Well, you know, that's part of
addiction. There are shame-producing things that we do, that just comes with the territory."
While many who have spoken but against the program have highlighted their prèference for a
program that, like the county's program, havo a "öne-to-ohö" needle exchange policy, the state,
said Elerick in a previous interview, does not certify new programs that llmit needle exchanges
to one-for-one, as that procedure is no longer considered "best practice" by state health
officials. The county syringe program is regularly under public fire, including in a June 2017
grand.report highlighting increasing needle litter, loss-than-full transparency and limits on public
access to services.

In addition to community members raising alarms on social media and at least one Change.örg
petition's more than 1,400 signätures as of Friday, other public opponents to the program to
date have inoluded Santa Cruz County Sheriff Jim Hart, Santa Cruz Police Chiof Andy Mills,
Watsonville Police Chief Dave Honda and Santa Cruz County Supervisors Bruce McPherson
and Ryan Coonerty,

Officials weigh in

"I cannot support a needle exohange expansion without local oversight and accountability, a
plan to reduce discarded needles and ensuring the effectiyehess of reducing infection rates,"
Santa Cruz Police Chief Mills wrote in his blog last month. "When these standards
are met, I'II gladly support a harm deduction program expansion."
*A new exchange would rob the County's exchange of the opportunity to connect with clients,
counsel them and connect with clients, counsel them and connect them to treatment," County
Supervisors Coonerty and MoPherson wrote to the state. "Santa Cruz County has wotked very
hard to design and implement a Drug.Medi-Cal Organized Delivery System, which has
signficantly expanded treatment capacity and the Gounty's syringe program is in the best
position ta, be able to connect injection drug uisers with treatment,"

"1 am not aware of any outreach by the Harm ReQucuOn COUOI1O FrC pIUpyVUM
they would serve. The Board of Supervisors, the business community, the Parks Department,
the shcools and I were nöt contacted about this proposed program," Sheriff Hart wrote to the
state, "If outreach were done, believe the Harm Reduction Coalition would hear that this
program is not wanted or needed."
"In reviewing the application, I am concerned regarding the following issues," Watsonville
Police Chief Honda wrote to the state. "The applicant refers to a "slgnificant overdose increase"
in the City of Watsonville in 2018. In reviëwing our statistical data there is no is indication of an
increase in overdoses in our City, in fact, there was no change from 2017 to 2018.

The applicant makes nö distinction between overdoses from those involving syringes to those
related to pills or alcohol. Our statistical data indicates the majority of our reported overdoses
werö from the use of pills and alcohol, not syringes!

SANTA CRUZ -A cofounder for long-time Santa Cruz social justice-focused
nonprofit organization is distancing his group from a mobile hypodermic needle
distribution program seeking state certification.

Rev. Herb Schmidt, who helped form United Services Agency Inc. (USA) with
homelëssness issues advocate Paul Lee in 1970, told the Sentinel on Tuesday
that it recently came to his attention that the Harm Reduction Coalition Road Show
applicatlon to the California Department of Public Health, Office of AIDS lists his
group as its nonprofit fiscal sponsor. Schmidt said the misunderstanding appeared
to sfem from communication between. Lee and Harm Reduction Coalition leader
Denise Elerick.

"When Paul brought It to me, said, well, she should go to the county health
department and have them sponsor it, because we don't have any medical.
expertise and I think she really needs someone who has medical expertise to help
them in doing it, to make sure that it's the best thing for the homeless population,"
Schmidt said. "We didn't even it bring it to our board. So, 1 just forgot about it."
Elerick, an Aptos resident and dental hyglenist, has been leading recent efforts to
turn an informal mobile needle exchange effort into an organization with state
standing that would allow the group to seek sterile drug injection supplies directly.

10/18/2020 Sania Cruz noedlé: service's nomproft sponsorship clarifed - Sania Cruz Sontinel
Nonprofit fiscal sponsorship allows an entity to seek grants and solicit tax-
deductible donations. Elerick said by email from out of the country that'fiscal
sponsorship is "not really a required plece of our application but l added in to be
thorough." The group now has sponsorship from Tacoma, Washington-based
North American Syringe Exohange Network, shë said.

"Paul Leo had made the offer," Elerick wrote. "When Herb needed more
information there was. some hesitancy because of 'needing Insurance' and the
likelihood that USA will be closing down most likely."
Schmidt said he found out about the program's certification application from
former Sanfa Cruz Mayor Davld Terrazas, who recently phoned to question
Schmidt on his group's ties to the Harm Reduction Coalition, Schmidt said he was
a "little disturbed" to hear that his group's name was attached to the effort withöut
formal approval, and he has since written letters to the Santa Cruz City Council
and the state clarifying the Issue.

"We have no medical expertise. No idea about what the fiscal llability would be.
We don't have any way of knowing If what she's doing is helpful or not helpful,"
Schmidt said. "I've got my own questions about that. My own feeling is, that as
important as it is to givè needlos that aren't contaminated - that's very important
but more important is. that we get people into ireatment. And that seems to me
the big problem here in our county."

The state's:45-day public comment deadline and opportunity for officials to confer
with the local health officer and local law enforcement officials on the pending
certification ends Friday. Department of Public Health officials then have 30 days.
to decide whether or not to certify the application.

'Exchange' vs. distribution
The volunteer-run needfe service program, which has been operating informally
for years as an unauthorized conduit between the exlsting Sarita Cruz County-run. Syringe Services Program and drug users, has come under fire in recent weeks
:by local law enforcement, community members and elected officials. Concerns •Have rún the gamut from fears of increased needle litter and the "enablement" of
drug addiction to lack of professional training or oversight and sufficient tefetral to
addiction and health services.

One key sticking point for many outspoken on the issue is (hat the Harm
Reductión Road Show would not enforce a one-to-one needle exchange pollicy.
However; the California Department of Pubilo Health, Officé of AIDS in an issue
brief on its wobsite advises syringe exchange programs to adopt "needs-based
disiribution policles" versus one-for-one exchanges and per-person limits on
syringe program participants.
"Poljcymakers have sometimes instituted restrictive syringe access policies in the
belief that such policies would reduce syringe litter or serve as a means of
changing behavior among PWID (peöple who Inject drugs)," according to the state
brief. "These concerns have not been born out in research on syringe distribution
policies:*

Needle exchange programs gained traction and political backing nationally'in the
1980s, in the midst of the AIDS epidemic. Use of dirty needles is cited as putting
people at greater risk of viral and baçterial Infections, Including HIV, viral hepatitis
and skin and soft tissue infections. Santa Cruz County health officials launched its
own needle exchange program in 2013, eventually replacing the existing nonprofit
Street Outreach Supporters.

In rosponse to your letter dated June 12, 2019, the Santa Crüz Counoil, at its meeting on September 24, 2019, directed the Mayor to: wrlte a letter expressing openness to four additional syringe disposal klosks with. locations to be determined by the City Mäuager's Office, and with ull costs and labor for the placement and maintenance of these kiasks to be covered by the County and their contractors in perpetuity, A number of smaller, secure syringe disposal bins may also be appropriate in certain locations, installed and serviced at the County's expensó. In addition, to address the sepurge of necdle litter in our community, the City urgus the County to estabiish a 24/7 needle litter response programn.
As the County revisits its harm reduction programs, conducts community outreach, and gathers data O1l feasibility and effectiveness of its various programs, the City intends to engage with the process before consideration ot safe infection sites, syringe exchange sites, or secondary syringe exchänges are considered; and, in any evont, would expect the County to have prior City approval before such programs and/or services are located within the City of Santa Cruz' jurisdiction.
The City greatly appreciates the County's attention and outreach on this issue and desires to continue an
uctjve partnership.

RE: OPPOSITION TO HARM REDUCTION COALITION OF SANTÁ CRUZ COUNTY
SYRINGE EXCHANGE PROGRAM CERTIFICATION APPLICATION
Dear Administrators of the State-Certifled Syringe Services Program:
Grant Park Neighbors (GPN) is an organized neighborhood group with an active email list with just over 100 members and röughly 30 aclive slakeholders that meet every fwo weeks In Grant Park. Nearly a year ago, GPN collectively wrote this vision statement:
Grant Park Nelghbors works with the Parks & Recreation Department, Santa Cruz City and County to promote a safe and welcoming environment for neighbors and the community to gather for recreational, leisurely and family activitles, and to enjoy the beauty of the park.
Grant Park and the surrounding neighborhood are directly impacted by the programs, services,
and administrative reach of the Emeline County Campus (ECC), including the Syringé
Exchange Program. GPN supports County leadership in their opposition to the Harm Reductlon Coalition (HRC)'s syringe exchange program application to the California Department of Public Heallh (CaPH). Most GPN members believe that any syringe exchänge program administered in the County should be directly adminlstered by the County's Heaith Services Agency. After our regular meeting on January 12, 2020, the GPN members in attendance outlined three principle reasons for opposing the HRC's application to the CaPH:
1) We believe HRC is directly the cause for an oversupply of needles in our community. An oversupply of needles into the local community creates a real and ongoing health hazard to Gränt Park, one that has highly impacted our neighborhoad over the past two years.

1 of 2

00151

This impact has forced the City to close the park at lenglh, and continues to cause regular disruption of park services,
2) HRC's method of providing needle exchange services counteracts any hope for County treätment and hampers the agency's power to directly address the opioid crisis. With the HRC, clients of the syringe exchange program never have an opportunity fo be
exposed to legitimate treatment,
3) GPN is unconvinced the HRC will hold any accountability in regard to the impacts of
their services under the current CaPH application; furthen, we do not believe the HRC
has the professional capacity to provide the treatment services their clients deserye.

Sincerely,
310C

Brad Angell
Director, Grant Park Neighbors

WI. Applicant Örganization. Descriptlon

Please briefly describe the organization's mission and core services:
The Harm Reduction Coalition of Santa Cruz County (HRCSCC) is a volunteer-run community
organization serying people who use drugs in Santa Cruz County and thereby Improving the health of the entire commupity. Our goal ls to support positive changes in the lives of people
who use drugs, slow the spread of preventable blood-borne viruses and other injection related
infections, and to prevent overdoses. Our coalition has been providing services by working in
collaboration with Santa Cruz County's SSP for 18 months.
We follow best practices around HIV & viral hepatitis prevention, care for injection dirug users,
and provide overdose prevention. We provide services and referrals that focus on overall health and wellness. This approach emerges from the philosophy of harm reduction;
acknowledging that a potentially harmful behavlor wiIl take place and then doing all that we can to minimize the harm to the indlvidual and the community.
The services we provide and will continue to provide include education on the topics of safe
injection, Hly and viral hepätitis prevention, overdose prevention, and proper syringe disposal; other services include distribution of naloxone, safe sex supplies and fentanyl test strips,
collection and safe disposal of used syringes, and access to clean syringes and other crucial
injection supplies as needed,
We aiso offer and will cantinue to offer referrals to: substance use disorder treatment services,
food and shelter programs, viral hepätitis and HIV testing and counseling, Hepatitis A and
Hepatitis B vaccinations, and referrals to screenings for sexually transmitted Infections. HRCSCC
will be an integral contact for people who have needs beyond the immediate need for safer injectlon practices. We understand that harm reduction is critical in all facets of one's life, and
so we are always trying to meet a large variety of needs that people may have in order to® improve the health of our entire community.
Above all, we will strive to include Input from people that use drugs and to let our participants
decide how we provide and expand our services. Taking direction from the people who make
use of our services is critical for multiple reasons. It is an evidence-based practice that has been
shown to increase engagement with services and improve health outcomes, and It is also a key
principle in harm reduction because it gives agency to thöse most impacted by the harm we are
addressing,
We are.also committed to lessening the amount of syringe. litter throughout our county, We
follow evidence-based practices that ensure that we are always having a positive impact on this
issue by providing our a participants with a convenient and safe way to dispose of used syringes
along with the proper sharps containers for them to keep their used syringes in. Our volunteers

are regularly spending time collecting used syringes from the ground every single week. Lastly,
our website also provides an easy explanation of how to report a used syringe they have found
SO that it can be cleaned up safely.
In May of 2019 the Harm Reduction Coalition of Santa Cruz initlated the process to become
authorized to operate a supplemental syringe access program. We temporarily withdrew our
application to address mapping details and legitimate concerns in the community. A primary concerh was that HRCSCC would be providing syringe access in county parks, despite services not having èver been provided in a park. However, we want to value the input we have
received by clearly stating that we hereby make a commitment that syringe access sérvices will
not occur in any county park, city park or state park:

Please provide a description of the proposed syringe exchange services and any additional
services that will accompany syringe exchange, such as overdose prevention supplies and
education:
•We will run a volunteer-based mobile syringe service as well as a home delivery service. This will be a needs-based exchange program that will be partly staffed by peers with lived experience with drug use, with the rest of the voluntèers being people with a strong interest in this work because of how harm associated with drug use has impacted their lives. We will
distribute naloxone and provide education on overdose prevention through our exchange, and
we will also do mobile naloxone distribution without a syringe component on a regular basís.
The services we provide and will continue to provide include education on the topics of: safe injection, HIV and vital hepatitis prevention overdose prevention, and proper syringe disposal; other services include distribution of naloxone, safe sex supplies and fentanyl test strips, collectlon and safe disposal of used syringes, and access to clean syringes and other crucial Injection supplies as néeded.
We also offer referrals to: substance use disorder treatment services, food and shelter
programs, viral hepatitis and HIV testing and counseling, Hepatitis A and. Hepatitis B
vaccinations, and referrals to screenings for sexually transmitted infections, HRCSCC will be an
integral contact for people who have needs-beyond the immediate need for safer injection practices. We understand that harm reduction is critical in all facets of one's life, and so we are always trying to meet a large varlety of needs that people may have in order to improve the health of our entire community.
Above all, we will strive to include input from people that use drugs and to let our participants

Short Summary:

HRCSCC.seeks to operate a SEP, this program will largely be a home dellvery service but will also
include regularly occurring mobile outreach In the City of Santa Crüz,

00158

Attachment 1

The location of that mobile outreach is the same location that our coalition häs been providing
secondary exchange services in collaboration with Santa Cruz County's SSP for almost 18 months. This location is a stretch of public property on the part of Coral $t that is between Limekiln St and River St. This outreach occurs on Sundays between the hours of 9 a.m, and 11
p.m., and our outreach site is always staffed by 5 or more well-trajned volunteers.
Our home delivery services will be avallable to people across the entire county, and the services
will be provided where the participants live. We will schedule appointments on request for
participants on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at times of day that are determined based
on need. Volunteers will primarily use cars to travel to meet with participants.
We are proposing to continue to provide the services we currently provide as a secondary síte which includes education on the topics of: safe injection, HIV and viral hepatitis prevention,
overdose prevention, and proper syringe disposal; other services include distribution of naloxone, safe sex supplies and fentanyl test strips, collection and safe disposal of used syringes, and access to clean syringes and other crucial injection supplies as needed.
We also offer referrals to; substance use disorder treatment services, food and shelter
programs, viral hepatitis and HIV testing and counseling, Hepatitis A and Hepatitis
vaccinations, and referrals to screenings for sexually transmitted Infections. HRCSCC will be an

always trying to meet a large variety of needs that people may have in order to Improve the
hea|th of our entire community.

V. Needs Statement:
The history of syringe access in Santa Cruz County is founded in mobile outreach and home
delivery. Many people will not use the county fixed site due to moblity issues, transportation, hours of operation, apprehensions to use a government based medical model program, and
fear of carrying paraphernalia. Our county's program uses a 1:d model, and we plan to use a
needs-based model.
There are isolated people in our county who do not have access to adequate syringe services,
and we would like to increase our outreach to them. Sapta Cruz County has a high rate of
overdose deaths, with the 17th highest rate of opioid overdose deaths among CA's 58 countles.
SÇ's rate (8.2/100k pop) was 48% higher than the statewide rate (5.54/100k). Santa Cruz had
the 12tb highest rate of heroin overdose deaths, and that rate (4.25/100k) was 136% higher than the statewide rate (1.8/100k) [1]. Watsonville experienced a significant overdose increase
in 2018, and the south end of our county receives even less services than the rest of the county;
due to limited hours at the Watsonville campus of the county SSP.

00159

Attächment 1

HCV data for Santa Cruz County (2015) shows a ratè of 108.1 cases per 100,000 people, which was a significant increase since 2011 and was also significantly higher than the statewide rate [2]. Between 2017 and 2018, a Hepatitis A outbreak in the county led to 76 confirmed casès (3].
Betweeh 2013-2017, 16% of all new HIV Infections were people-who inject drugs [4].

Section VI

Section VI Additional Required Information

A. Syringe Dispensing Plan

The syringe transaction model will be a needs-based model. The participant and a volunteer will determine how many syringes will be distributed based on the number of individuals the participant is supporting with clean equipment, the number of times per day supplies are needed and the individual's ability to visit any syringe exchange program.

We will continue to provide syringes in all sizes requested by our participants and volunteers will assist participants in identifying the size of syringe that works best for them.
There will not be a limit on the number of syringes provided to each participant, ás the goal is to meet the U.S. Public Health Service recommendation of having a new sterile syringe for each irijection.

All olients are urged to return ysed syfinges and dispose of them properly with us or the County Health Services Syringe Services Program, or by utilizing publicly accessible sharps
containers, kiosks or pharmacy drop offs. Clients are urged to reduce the risk of reedlestick to others by not disposing in a garbage can or improperly leaving syringes in bathrooms or öther areas where they may inject.

We will continue to provide safe injection supplles such as cookers, cotton, waters,
alcohof wipes, hand wipes, and tourniquets. as recommended to prevent sharing and cross
contamination, which can lead to disease transmission. Clients will be instructed on the naed for
proper disposal of the above supplies.

B. Syringe collection and disposal plan

Collection Procedure:

All sharps are to be placed in a sharps container läbeled with the word "Biohazard" and
the international biohazard symbol.
The sharps container will be rigld puncture-resistant container which when sealed is leak resistant and cannot be reopened without great difficulty. All syringes collected by the SEP shall be kept and transported in such contalners.
During SEP transactions, sharps containers should be placed between the participant
and voluntgers. Voluntéers should never hold the sharps container during an exchange. The contalner should be pläced on a secure table, and should be kept level at all times. Any injection equipment that falls outside of the sharps container should be retrieved by the participant and placed in the sharps container. If this is not possible, volunteers should use tongs to retrieve the injection equipment.

00161

Section VI

Sharps containers should never be filled beyond the manufacturar's fill line; the container should never be more than 75% full. Volunteers should not insert their hands into the sharps container or forcibly push used injection equipment down into the container. The volunteer filling the role of Data Callector shall be responsible for assessing thé estimated number of collected syringes after every exchange session. They will be trained in how to estimate this informatión from the size of various sharps containers.

Compliance:

We will provide volunteers with sharps waste disposal education that ensures they are familiar with state law regulating proper disposal of home-generated sharps waste.as referenced in HSC Section 118286. All volunteers will also receive a follow-up refresher
training on this topic on a yearly basis. This education should also be available and
offered to participants.

Needlestick Injurias:
We will use a set protacol to address accidental nèediestick injuries, and we will traln all volunteers. on this protocol. Ail volunteers will also receive à follow-up refresher training on this topic an a yearly basis. A written copy of this protocol will be kept with any volunteers wha are expecting to collect used syringes. The protocol is as follows: In the event of a needlestick of any participant or volunteer with a used or potentially used syringe, the following protocol shall be used:
1. The site should be immediately washed with soap® and water. 2. The exposure should be assessed (type of fluid, type of needle, amount of blcod on the needle, eto). Notes should be taken of this information.
3. If the person wha used the syringe in question previously is present, they should be asked if they are aware of any viral infections they have. 4. The viclim of the needlestick should be brought immediately to the hospital.

Disposal:

We will apply for funding support to cover disposal contracting costs with the CDPH
syringe supplies clearinghouse.

C. Service delivery plan
HRCSCO seeks to operate a SEP, this program will largely be a home delivery service but will alsö inolude regularly ocourring mobile outreach in the City of Santa Cruz.
The tocation of that mobile outreach is the same location that our coalition has been providing secondary exchange services in collaboration with Santa Cruz County's SSP for almost 18 months. This location is a stretch of public property on the part of Coral St that is between

Limekiln St and River St. This outreach oocurs ori Sundays between the hours of 9 a.m, and 11p.m., and our outreach site is always staffed by 5 or 5 more weil-trained yolunteers.
Our home delivery services will be available fo people across the entiré county, and the services will bie provided where the participants live. We will schedule appointments on request fór participants on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays at times of day that are determined based on need, Volunteers will primarily use cars to travel to. meet with participants.
In May of 201.9 the Harm Reduction Coalition of Santa Cruz initiated the process to become aulhorized to operate a supplemental syringe access program. We temporärily withdrew our application to address mapping details and tegilimate concerns in the community. A primary concern was that HRCSCC would be providing syringe access in county parks, despite services not having ever been provided in a park. However, we want to value the input we have received by clearly stating that we hereby make a commitment that syringe acoess services will not occur in any county park, city park or state park,
The services we provide and will continue to provide include education on the topics of: safe Injection, HIV and viral hepatitis prevention, overdose prevention, and proper syringe dispösal; other services include distribution of natoxone, safe sox supplies and fentanyl test strips, collection and safe disposal of used syringes, and access to dlean syringes and other crucial injection supplies as needed.
We also offer and will continue to offer referrals to: substance use disorder treatment services, food and shelter programs, viral hepatitis and HIV festing and counseling, Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B vaccinations, and referrals to screenings for sexually transmitted infections. HROSCC will be an integral contact for people who have needs beyond the immediate need for eafer injection practices. We understand that harm reduction is critical in all facets of one's life, and 50 we are always trying to meet a large variely of needs that people may have in order to improve the health of our entire community.
Above all, we will strive to include input from people that use drügs and to let our participants deçide how we provide and expand our services. Taking direction from the people who make üse of our services is critical for multiple reasons. It is an evidence-based practice that häs been shown to increase engagement with services and improve health outcomes, and it is also a key principle in harm reduction because it gives agency to those most impacted by the harm we are
addressing.

We are also committed to lessening the amount of syringe litter throughout our couinty. We follow evidence-based practices that ensure that we are always having a positive impact on this issue by providing our partioipants with a convenlent and safe way to dispose of used syringes along with the proper sharps containers for themn to keep their used ayringes in. Our volunteers are regularly spending time collecting used syringes from the ground every single week. Lastly, our website also provides an easy explanation of how to report a used sytinge they have found
so that it can be. cleaned up safely,

00163

Section VI

D. Data colfection and program evaluation plan

We will record the number of participants served, their gender, race, and age, total number of syringes received, total number of syringes dispensed, number of recent naloxone reversals reported by participants and total number of naloxone kits given out. We will also keep a record of the number of syringes we pay to.have disposed through our medical waste dispösal service provider.

Data along with a desoription of program services and accomplishments will be reported on an annnual basis to the CDPH Office of AIDS and the Santa Cruz County Heajth Officer,

In addition, we will participate in the annual survey and/or other data collection efforts conducted through CDPH/OA and the Syringé Supply Clearinghouse.

To evaluäte our program, we will regularly ask participants how we can improve our services and what they feel is missing from our program. Volunteers will also be asked to regularly evaluate our work, but the feedback from participants will be prioritized first and foremost.

Incorporating the feedback of our particlpants into our work is critical to the success of our programs. Our volunteers are constantly in conversation with our participants about our
services, and the peer-based model we use allows for the rejationships between our volunteers
and participants to be honest and generative. We have preated an accessible model of outreach
that allows participants to be easily trained to become regular volunteers. Core volunteers meet twice a month to discuss feedback and make decisións about our programs. We also have larger coalition meetinga several times a year, and participants are frequently a big part of them. In the future we hope to formalize the role of participants in driving our program, with the eventual goal being a formalized board made up entirely of participants that has decision- making power and a significant voice within our coalition,

E. Community relations plan

As a community-based program, we take the work of relating to our entire community very
seriously. We seek to not only do the work of harm reduction but also to help spread the ideas
of harm reduction and bulld support for our program and the rest of the web of care that
supports people who use drugs,

To that end, we are committed to addressing the concerns that have been raised in our County in
about syringe access and overdose prevention. We are committed to adapting our program to fit
our specifia local situation, SO long as we can continue providing evidence-based services to as
many people who need them as possible.
We have already done a buge amount of work to bring thé community along with us as we build out our program. The most relevant of that work is Ilsted in Appendix 1.

00.164

Section Vl

Our plan for continuing to build support and address concerns with our program is as follows:

0 We will record, in a written format, any interactions between local law enforcement and oür volunteers or participants in their role as participants, Whether positive or negative, we will ensure that this information is properly collected and kept.
g We will continue to meet with elected officials, community leaders, community organizations, law enforcement, the media, and individual community members. In these meetings we will directly address concerns and communicate clearly if we plan to make ohanges to our program based on these conderns. We will also use these meetings to build support for our program specifically and harm reduction in general. We will use these meetings to determine what forms of community input will work best för our SEP. We will always leave ourselves open to hearing from people who wish tà spoak about our work, and we are confident that we can find the proper forums for people to address their concerns with us. We-will work with our allies to ensure there is a consistent presence of visible public support our program. We will do public outreach at events, höld trainings, appear in the news in print and on TV, integrate our message into organizations doing regular canvassing of the community, and post flyers and art publicly.

I'm concerned about the repeated interest expressed by some folks in Santa Cruz in marking

I think the 6/21 time works for us, though let's let Caral confirm since she's typically out of the office the

I had some good debriefs yesterday with several people from HRCSC and Savannah

(oncilt@harumeduction.org) and Jenna (haywoodtWhacuinxluction,.org) from HRC, so l think we have a
pretty good sense of how things went, but definitely Interested in your perspective and what we can do to help. I'm especially keen on understanding exactly what the marching orders from the BOS are. Partly
becäuse l'd ike to get moving on the disposal study and related questions we might weave Into it. Partly in
case thère are things.we need to respond to - 1 heard for example that there were suggestions like doing
some variety of syringe tracking and some other things that are effectively not possible/advisable. Any
chance we could have at least a brief chat before 8 days from now?

Hi Matt and Carol,
Hope all is well. We look forward to updating you about our meeting, which had great public support, including wonderful testimony from HRC. However, there was much concern regarding the decline of incividuals accessing our program and the steady rise of secordary exchänge. There were many amendments made to our recommendations, so we are waiting on confirmation of what the board has directed US to do. I believe the proposal för the syringe litter study was approved. Far our follow-up call, let us know which option works best for you:
Friday 6/2L, 3:30-4:30pm
Wednesday 6/26, 9:30-10;30am
Also, I wahted to know if you could share Savannah O'Neil's contact info? She made a powerful
statement at the board meeting - that Santa Cruz County has a high comparative rate for a potential HIV outbreäk. I'd like to hear more about the analysis that led to this conclusion, and possibly
connect her with our new HIV. Surveillance Coordinator.
Thank youf

Hi Jen & Mimi,
Your write-up and associated materials for the report look really solid, thanks for sharing.
Unfortunately I'm not going to.be able to make it down on the 11th the sense at CDPH is that it's
beiter for us to haing back from public events like this because of the Intensity around the HRCSC
application. Sorry about that.
We can of course commit to working with you on the syringe litter evaluation. As we discussed, J think that shouldinclude (a) visual inspection of areas identified as having / at .risk of syrlnge litter,
(b) a short survey offered to anyane using the SSP in a given peried, and (c) at least 2 focus groups,
ideally involving both SCHSA and HRCSC partjcipants and at least one group qutside Santa Cruz city
(Watsonville, etc). i think (a) and (c) can be accomplished in a couple days of work; (b) over the
course of several days or a week depending on what we decide for a target # of responses. think we
should shoot for mid- or late-August to do It, and Inagine It won't take-more than a week to draft a
report. Budget-wise, I would love for oné of your staff to be closely involved in actually doing the
data collection and analysis, and if possible 1-2 recruited, paid/stipènded participants to help with al!
aspects of the projèct. Finally we'll need some money for incentives for focus group participants. It'd
be nice to dö that for survey lespondents too, but we can probably keep it short enough that it

00170

wön't be really necessarÿ. 50 let's talk about that and get the plan and timoline in place let me know whon you'd like to get On the phone,
We also should have a few other things relevant to that soon. HRC will soon have a public version of their needs assessment from last year's "harm reduction listening session" in Santa Cruz, which should be pretty useful and includes lats of feedback from SSP participants. CDPH is finalizing a new briefing document on syringe disposal that shöuld be public in about a month. And Carol and Alessandra are going to send the San Francisco Comptroller's Öffice your way; they've been charged by the mayör with planning around the city's clean streets initiative, which includes work related to syringes; and it sounds like they have some good ideas and also want ta learn from other jurisdictionis.

(831) 454-2200
Subject: Opposition to the Syringe Exchange Program Application from the Harm Reduction Coalition
Meeting Date: January 14, 2020

Recommended Action: Djrect the Chair of the Board to send a leiter to the Callfornia Department of Public Health opposing the syringe exchange program application from the Harm Reduction Coalition (HRC) of Santa Cruz County.
Executive Summary The Harm Reduction Coalition of Santa Cruz County has applied to the State for certification of a new. syringe exchange program that would operate in Santa Cruz County. HRC is proposing a mobile location on Coral Street in the Cily of Santa Cruz and a home delivery service throughout the County as well. The California Department of Public Health is currently accepting public comments on HRC's application and the deadlina for comments is January 20, 2020.
There are numerous serious concerns with this application, including the fact that our community has struggled with a persistent syringe litter problem for many years and a new syringe program that is not a 1 to 1 exchange is likely to exacerbate that problem. Santa Cruz County's Syringe Services Program distributed close to 600,000 syringes. this past year to injection drug users and is already meeting the need for clean syringes for this population as evidenced by years* of relatively stable disease rates. The County's SSP alsò provides enhanced access to troatment and testing that injection drug users will not be able to easily açcess if HRC's application is approved and clients are drawn away from the County's program. In addition, HRC's proposed location, adjacent to the County's only family shelter on Coral Street, is inappropriate and would create further community impacts to our most vulnerable residents.
Santa Cruz County already operates a robust, professionally-run Syringe Services Program. A new volunteer-run syringe program with no local oversight and multiple potential negative impaots to our community is unnecessary, harmful, and should be opposed by our Board.
Background For many years Santa Cruz County has operated a Syringe Services Program (SSP) with the goal of prötecting and promoting residents' health and safety by preventing the sproad of disease associated with injection drug use, and by decreasing the number of improperly disposed syringes in the community, The County's SSP is staffed by

00175

medical professionals, maintains two locations, and is well known and well utilized. Santa Cruz County has worked very hard to design and implement a Drug Medi-Cal Organized Delivery System which has significantly expanded treatment capacily, and the County's syringe program is in the best position to. bé able to connect injectión drug users with treatment.

In May of 2019 the Harm Reduction Coalition submitted an application for a separate, privately-run state-authortzed syringe exchange program to operate in Santa Crüz County. This application raised serious concems throughout the community and drew more than 2,000 signatures on a petition opposed to the application. While that application was ultimately withdrawn amid community opposition, now the same organization häs submitted.a new, substantially similar application to distribute syringes in our community.
Analysis

LITTER
Our community has struggled with a persistent syringe litter problem for multiple years now. The Office of AIDS should avoid authorizing a syringe exchange program that could exacerbate syringe litter problems. In Santa Cruz County, in the span of less than 11 months (7/1/18 to 5/15/19), a community olean-up. organization picked up nearly 6,000 syringes (n public areas. In addition, the City of Santa Cruz Parks and Recreation Department picked up 3,501 syringes in parks änd beaches in 2017 and 4,171 syringes in 2018. Save Our Shores, a local erivironmental non-profit that focuses on clean beaches, has also picked up hundreds of syringes that threaten the health of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. While the County's SSP operates on a 1 to 1 exchange policy, the HRC's proposed program would not be:a to 1 exchange, which is likely to exacerbate the syringe litter problem. The public health impacts and environmental Impacts of syringe litter must be considered.
Santa Cruz County has worked hard to address syringe litter; which we see as a public health issue that needs to be taken seriously. In order to deal with syringe litter, Santa Cruz County has placed sharps kiosks in multiple locations and required local pharmacies to participate in a sharps take-back program. Furthermore, the County's Syringe Services Program provides sharps containers and urges clients to dispose of syringes property. Yet, despite these efforts, the syringe litter problem has persisted. When syringe litter reaches the volumes thät is has in Santa Cruz County (pärticularly in the Clty of Santa Cruz) there are significant, far-reaching public health impacts, as some parents don't feel safe bringing their children to loçal parks and open spaces, using lo.cal public bathrooms, and participating in summer recreational programs oni the beach due to concerns that their children will step on syringes. These concerns are not unfounded as many County residents have reported needle sticks throughout the year's. Residents should not have to live this way.

COUNTY'S SSP
HRC's current volunteer-run syringe distribution effort undermines and draws clients
away from the County's professionally-run locally-authorized syringe exchange program. In Santa Cruz County, while the hours and locations of our SSP have remained constant, the number of unfque IDs (clients) that visit one of our sites has

00176

dropped drastically (387 visits in Sept. 2017, and only 148 visits in Sept. 2019) and the number of syringes dispensed has increased significantly as a number of volunteer secondary-exchangers associated with HRC have become more active. This secondary exchange activity by community volunteers has diverted injection drug users (whö previously visited the County SSP) from the opportunity to see medical professionals who can identify and assist with medical issues, provide testing for diseases, connect clients to treatment and more. In such circumstances, It is a disservice, and potentially even a danger to injection drug users for the state fo authorize a separate syringe exchänge program ta operate, bacause clients will shlft to a syringe source that will not have the critical medical expertise that our SSP offers. Santa Cruz County has worked very hard (and invested heavily) to design and implement a Drug-Medi-Cal Organized Delivery system which has significantly expanded treatment capacity. Therefore our County's syringe program is in the best position to be able to connect injection drug users. with treatment such as the County's Medication Assisted Treatment program.
The County-run SSP is accessible and will be increasing hours to become even more accessible per Board action on December 10, 2019: In addition, the SSP is exploring shifting hours to the most optimal times för utilization. The County's SSP continues to allow secondary exchange and provides a range of services. In our refatively small County of 274,000 residents, our SSP dispensed nearly 600,000 syringes ini the last year, which is per caplta rate greater than Monterey County, Santa Clara County and San Mateo County's per capita rates combined. Santa Cruz County is not a community that lacks syringe access. County disease datà has been relatively level with a downward trend in newly reported HIV cases and significantly fewer new cases of Hepatitis C reported, in 2018. The County's program is already meeting the need for clean syringes and an additional syringe exchange program is not needed.
HRC's application doesn't appear to include oversight and involvement of licensed medical professionals. Santa Cruz County's Syringe Services Program is within the Publio Health Division of the County's Health Services Agency, and the program is run with the oversight of professional health staff. Additionally, the County has formed a new commission to provide advice on improving our County SSP.
PROPOSED LOCATION The HRC describes their proposed location of mobile syringe services as, "a stretch af public property on the part of Coral Street that is between Limekiln Street and River Street. This outreach occurs on Sundays between the hours of 9am and 11pm." This location is completely inappropriate. The described location is in front of the Rebele Family Shelter, which provides emérgency shelter for 28 households with children (approximately 90 individuals). The homeless children staying at the family shelter have been through enough adversity and often traumatic experiences. While their family is stabilizing in the shelter and working toward obtaining permanent housing, these children should not have to endure volunteer-run syringe distribution outside their building every Sunday. These vulnerable. children and families deserve the state's consideration.
In addition to the family shelter, the Housing Matters campus on Coral Street Includes shelter beds for homeless individuals, some of whom have struggled with addiction and are working hard to stay clean. A syringe distribution program that draws substance

00177

abusers (and sometimes their dealers) to that area only makes it harder for the individuals in recovery to resist the temptation to use drugs.
In addition, there have been concerns about syringe distribution volunteers operating at local parks in the past without outreach to the community and without authorization of local jurlsdictions. While the HRC states that they won't operate in local parks, there doesn't appear to be a legal prohibitlon from the state that restricts syringe exchange activities in publio parks and open spaces.
It ls our understanding that when a state-authorized syringe exchange program proposes changing or adding exchange looations, there is no requirement for the Jocal government and the public to be informed and there is no opportunity to provide input. This is a concern because many locations are not appropriate for syringe exchange and it could be problematic for the HRC to start distributing syringes in a new neighborhood without any local consultation or consideration-of impacts.

Conclusion Our goal is to protect and promote all residents' health and safety. Our Board has consistently supported the continuation of the County's SSP even though it has been controversial at times. The County's SSP remains accessible and access to treatment has been increased. If the State approves the Harm Reduction Coalltion's application, it will further polarize our community on this difficult issue and would jeopardize the effectiveness of the County's Syringe Services Program. Our Board should express our opposition tò this application to the State.

Dear Director Angell:
Föllowing a unanimous vote of the Santa Cruz County Board of Superyisors, I am writing to you in oppositioni tö the latest application from the Harm Reduction Coalition of Santa Cruz County (HRCSCC) to operate a Syringe Exchange Program (SEP) in the County of Santa Cruz. There are numerous serious corcerns with this application, Inoluding the exacerbation of the syringe litter problem in our community, the fact that data shows HROSCC draws c|ients away from the County's Syringe Services Program, leaving clients with inferior care and less direct access to treatment, and a completely inappropriate proposed location outside a family homeless shelter. Our Board strongly opposes this application.
For many years Santa Cruz County has had a robüst professionally-run Syringe Services Program (SSP) with the goal of protecting and promoting residents' health and safety by preventing the spread of disease associated with Injection drug use, and by decreasing the number of improperly disposed syringes in the community. The County's SSP [8 staffed by medjcal professionals, maintains two locations, and is well-known and well-utillzed. Santa Cruz County has worked very hard to design and Implement a Drug Medi-Cal Organized Delivery System which has significantly expanded treatment capacity and the County's syringe program is in the best positlon to bè able to connect injection drug users with treatment.
HRCSCC's current volunteer-run sÿrlnge distribution effort undermines and draws eltents away from the County's professionally-run locally-authorized syrlnge exchange
program. In Santa Cruz County, while the hours and locations of our SSP were

00179

Page 2 January 17, 2020
constant, the number of unique IDs (clients) that vislt one of our sites has dropped drastically (387 visits in Sept. 2017, and only 148 visits in Sept. 2019) and the number of syringes dispensed has Increased significantly as a number of volunteer secondary- exchangers associated with HRÇ have become more active. This secondary exchange activity by community volunteers has diverted injection drug users (who previously visited the County SSP) from the opportunity to see medical professionals who can identify and assist with medical issues, provide testing for diseases, connect clients to treatment and more. In such circumstances, it'js a dis-service, and potentially even a danger to injection drug users for the state to authorize a separate syringe exchange program to operate, because clients will shift to a syringe source that will not have the critical medical expertise that our SSP offers. Santa Cruz County has worked very hard (and invested heavily) to design and implement a Drug-Medi-Cal Organ|zed Delivery system whichi has slgnificantly expanded treatment capacity and the County's syringe program is in the bast position to be able to connect injection drug users with treatment such as the County's Medication Assisted Treatment program.
The County-run SSP Is accessible and has recently increased hours to become even more accessible. In addition, the SSP is exploring shifting hours to the most optimal times for utilization. The County's SSP continues to allow secondary exchange and provides a range of services.
In our relatively small County of 274,000 residents, our SSP dispensed nearly 600,000 syringes in the last year, which is a per capita rate greater than Monterey County, Santa Clara County and San Mateo County's per capita rates combined, Santa Oruz County is not a community that lacks syringe access. County disease data has been relatively level with a downward trend in newly reported HIV cases and significantly fewer new cases of Hepatitis C reported in 2018. The County's. program is already meeting the need for clean syringes and an additional syringe excharige program is unnecessary and harmful.
HRCSCC's application doegn't appear to include oversight and involvement of licensed
medical professionals, Santa Cruz County's Syringe Services Program is within the Public Health Division of the County's Health Services Agency, and the program is run with the oversight of professional health staff. Ciients deserve the better care that the County's SSP provides.
Our community has struggled with a persistent syringe litter problem for many years and a new syringe program that is not a 1 to 1 exchange is likely to exacerbate this problem. The Office of AIDS should avoid authorizing a syringe exchange program that could exacerbate syringe litter probleme, In Santa Cruz County, in the span of less than 11 months, a community clean-up organization picked up nearly 6,000 syringes in publio areas. In addition, the City of Santa Cruz Parke Department picked up 3,501 syringes in parks and beaches in 2017 and 4,171 syringes In 2018. Save Our Shores, a local

00180

Page 3
January 17, 2020
environmental non-profit that focuses on clean beachas, has also picked up hundreds of syringes that threaten the health of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary. While the County's SSP operates on a 1 to 1 basis, the HRC's proposed program would not be a 1 to exchange, which is very likely to exacerbate the syringe litter problem, The public health Impacts and environmental impacts of syringe litter must be considered.
Santa Cruz County has worked hard to address syringe litter, which we see as a publio health issue that needs to be taken seriously, In order to deal with syringe litter, Santa Cruz County has placed sharps klosks in multiple locations, required local pharraoies to participate in a sharps take-back program, and the County's Syringe Services Pragram provides sharps containers and urges cilents to dispose of syringes property.
Yet, despite these efforts, the syringe litter problem has persisted. When syringe litter: reaches the volumes that is has in Santa Cruz County (particularly in the City of Santa Cruz) there are significant, far reaching public health impacts, as some parents don't feel safe bringing their children to local packs and open spaces, using local public bathrooms, and particlpating in summer recreational programs on the beach due to concemns that their children will step on syringes. These concerns are not unfounded as many County residents have reported needle sticks throughout the years. Residents should not have to live this way. The public health impacts and environmental impacts of syringe litter must be considered.
Furthermore, HRCSCC's proposed location, adjacent to the County's only family shelter, is completely inappropriate and would create further community impaots to our most vulnerable residents, This shelter provides emergency housing for approximately 90 individuals, Including 28 househotds with children. While families are stabilizing in* the shelter and working toward obtaining permanent housing, chlldren from thèse families should not have to endure volunteer-run syringe distribution outside their building every Sunday, and they deserve your consideration. Additionally, the Housing Matters campus on Coral Street includes shelter beds for homelesa individuals, some öf whom have struggled with addictlon and are working hard to stay clean A syringe
distribution program that draws substance abusers, and potentially drug dealers, to that area only makes It harder for the individuals in recovery to resist the temptation to use
drugs.
The Board's goal is to protect and promote all residents' health and safely, Our Board has consistently: supported the continuation of the County's SSP even though It has been controversjal at times. The County's SSP is more accessible thän ever and access
to treatment has been Increased. HRCSCC's application is opposed by all five members of the Board of Supervisors, local law enforcement leaders, and thousands of Santa Cruz County residents, If the State approves the Harm Reduction Coalition's application, there will likely be worse outcomes for inJection drug users as they are drawn away from the County SSP (as has been documented) and toward an entity that

00181

Page 4 January 17, 2020
doesn't have strong treatment connectlons, and isn't run by professionals. If the application is approved, It will harm our community, will further polarize our community on this difficult issue, and would jeopardize the effectiveness of the County's Syringe Services Program. What would be best for Injection drug users and best for the larger community (not to mention the environment) would be to support the County's professlonally-run SSP which has the abillty to change lives for the better and to deny HRCSCC's application, which would draw clients to an Inferior service, potentially putting them in danger. Injection drug users and our larger community deserve better. Our Board voted unanimously to express our opposition to this application to the State.
Please take our comments into consideration and deny this appilcation.

Sincerely, 1C7 RYAN COONERTY, Chair Board of Supervisors

Dear Ms. Katz,
am writing to you about the Harm Reduction Coalition's application to operate a mobile syringe delivery program in Santa Cruz County. Our county has an existing syringe wasto problem that plagues out cities, purks and beaches. Our county is the sceond smallest in the state geogrüphically and has about 275.000 residents. The County currently operates a robust SSP from two lications thut adequately meuts the needs of our I.V. drug-using population and provides wrap-around services.
A secondary program, with little to no oversight and no services other than handing out syringes. is not needed and will only exasperate, our syringe waste problem. • Approving the H1RU*S
application will negatively impact ublic safety by putting our community members al risk from
exposure to even, more syringe litter.
Recently, there have been concerns ubout HIRC staff using locul parks as a dispersal point. in their application: the HRC stated thoy would not opetate in local parks: however. there does not
appear to be a legal prohibition from the state that restricts services in public porks and open spaces. Additionally, it is my understanding that should the HRE receive state cortification; they can apply to the state to expand serviecs and amend their role without seeking approval from the county health officer. local law enforcement, or the publie.
ThoHIRC's lack of transparency and full disclosure in their first application has croded community confidence and trust in this organization, and concern exists that thc HR( will not operate within the parameters outlined in theirapplication or seck inpot/public comment ahout
chänges to the program should licensing approval occur.

RE: Opposition to Harm Reduction Coalition of Santa Cruz County Application

Dear Ms. Katz:

On behalf of the Scotts Valley City Council, I write to express concerns and opposition to the
Harm Reduction Coalition of Santä Crüz County's application, for a new syringe exchange program in Santa Cruz County,
The City Gouncil approached this determination with care: a Council Member representative met personally with the Harm Reduction Coalition and attended a "Listening Session" to learn about the proposed program; data and informatlon about Santa Cruz County's SSP were teviewed; local public safety staff were consulted; and, communiçations from local residents were considered.
The sum of this work is that while harm reduction practicos have a basis in evídence and a pläce in the public health system, how harm reductión is administered is critically Important. Harm reduction solutións must be considered within a more holistic picture of improving the clients* underlying health and addiction. Moreover, the impacts of harm reduction practices" on the larger community is a vitally impörtant consideration.
The Öity Councli has concerns that the Harm Reduction Coalilion's application doës nöt meet these tests. Specifically, the decoupling of mobile syringe distribution from direct access to medical professionals and addiction treafment that the Santa Cruz County's SSP provides hampers the larger goal of improving underlying health conditions and ending addiction. There are also concerns about public safety and other unintended consequences of an unsupervised, unlimited syringe supply in the greater community, Syringe litter is already a tremendous problem in the county, and strong oversight and controls through a 1:1 exchange is necessary for protection of the community at large.
Accordingly, the Scotts Valley City Council expresses ils concern and opposition to the. Harm Reduction Coalition of Santa Cruz County's application for a new syringe exchange program,
Sincerely, RINEHL Räridy Jöhnson
Mayor

Dear Director Sonia Angell, MD, MPH:
I am writing to you in response to the latest applícation from the Harm Reduction Coalition of Santa Cruz County (HRCSCC) to operate a Syringe Exchange Program (SEP) in the County of Santa Cruz, specifically, in the City of Watsonville. Loppose this application.
in reviewing the application, 1 am concerned regarding the following issues:

• In Section IV - Description and Summary of Proposed SEP - The applicant has indicated that
there are no neighborhood associations afflllated with the proposed SEP sites, However,
the SEP proposes home dellvery services throughout the entire county. In Watsonville there are countless neighborhood associations (Bay Villäge; Pajaro Village, Portola Heights, and Pajaro Vista:to name a few) which should be consulted. The applicant's proposal is
open ended and seeks to operate an all-volunteer mobile exchange program purportedly
anywhere, any place without any support or outreach by local neighborhood assaciations.
In Section V of Attachment 1 - Needs Statement - The applicant indicates that Watsonville experienced a significant overdose Increase in 2018, The application does not reference a specific source for this data. In reviewing our statistical data there is no indication of an
increase in overdoses in our City. In fact, there was a significant reduction in calls for
services related to overdoses from 2017 to 2019: In addition, the applicant makes no distinction from reported overdoses from those involving syringes to those related to prescription drugs, pills, alcohol, or other illegal substances. In a meeting with the HRCSCC they did reference a report published by the Santa Cruz County Coroner's Office. That report is an overview of acute drug related deaths from 2008-2018. The report does not
specify or distinguish between incidents related to syringe usage and those that are not. It
also does not take into consideration all reported overdose cases that did not result in
death.

In Section V of Attachment 1 - Needs Statement • The applicant indicates that the south end of the county receives less services than the rest of the county due to limited hours at the Watsonville campxis of the County Syringe Services Program (SSP). However, in November

Chief of Police David Honda

2019, the County of Board of Supervisors authorized an increase in the hours of operation
of the County SSP Watsonville campus as well as the Santa Cruz campus, There is no evidence presented by the applicant of the need for a State Certified SSP to operate
independent of the County's SSP,

In Section VI (K) - Community Relations Plan - The applicant states that they have completed community work in support of their proposed second application. However, despite a reference to it, they did not include Appendix 1, which lists this work, Presently, it
is unclear wha't outreach, If any, has taken place in Watsonville. Since the submission of the
application, [ have been inundated with messages from community members and leaders
strongly opposing this application.
The scope ofHRCSCC's services are broad and present significant public health and safety concerns. The phrase "where participants live" includes encampments and other places that people without homes "live." It is imperative that trained County Health Professionals continue their management of the County authorized SSP to mitigate public health and safety risks to some of the most vulerable members of the Community,
To reiterate what 1 stated in my previous lettér, beliève in programs that assist our community members, who have addiction issues, help oyercome their addictions, protect them from
infections, and improve thelr Health. Lalso believe we have a responsibility to protect the balance of our community from the hazards of syringe litter and other health and safety issues that arise within our encampments. 1 cannot support a program that will put our families and out children atrisk from exposure to improperly discarded syringes/needles or other health/safety concerns. Please, consider these concerns and deny the application.
Respecfully,

David Hönda, Chief of Police

Dear Ms. Katz,
As the Chief of Police, I am once again asked to weigh-in on needle exchange programs authorized by the County of Santa Cruz and positioned in the City of Santa Cruz.

received many inquiries from community members regarding needle exchange and harm reduction strategies proffered by the Harm Reduction Coalition of Santa Cruz County. Police officers care about this issue because they are exposed daily to dirty needles. Frequently our officers receive needle stioks as people try to hide them in clothing, backpacks, and tents. Accordingly, police officers have a lot at stake in a promulgating thoughtful policy.
Harm Reduction makes sense from a public health, public finance and community safety policy perspective, Reducing the number of HIVIAIDS and Hep C cases in a community of high intravenous drug users is wise. The thought being fewer cases of disease equates to fewer exposures.
Let be honest. Syringe litter is a problem. Any proposal to distribute additional needles must include a method to further reduce needle litter and provide local community oversite. need to see an actual thoughtful procedure, not a simple reference to an evidence based practice. While research indicates that needle exchange, distribution and collection oan reduce needle litter, we frequently experience discarded needles in Santa Cruz. We have colleoted needles out of parks, from beäches and In rivers.
For a needle distribution volunteer program to be acceptable and have the confidence of this community, county oversight and community accounfability is critically important. An oversite group must weigh the risk of increased infection by intravenous drug users with the rjsk of accidental exposure by the graater community. Any needle exchange project must balance the risk of increased infection rates and likely overdoses, with the impact on the greater community. Santa Cruz has reached a tipping point where accidental exposure to dirty needles, and death by enabling overdoes is greater than the efficacy of preventing the use of used needles. Several drug users who get free needles told me personally they continue to share dirty réedles in spite of getting clean ones.

00189

cannot support a needle exchange expansion without local oversight and accountability; a plan to reduce discarded needles, and ensuring the effectiveness of reducing Infection tates and drug overdoses. When these standards are met, I'Il gladly support a harm deduction program expansion, but not at the location (Limekiln and. Coral) identified by HRCSC.

Best,

Harm Reduction Coalition of Santa Cruz County (HRCSCC) has submitted an application to the California Department of Public Health, Office of AIDS (CDPH/OA) for authorization of a syringe access and disposal prögram, HRCSCC has been providing services by working in collaboration with Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency's syringe services program (SSP) for the past 18 months. HRCSCC proposes to provide syringe services along with education on the topics of safer injection, HIV and viral hepatitis prevention, overdose prevention, and proper syringe disposal. Other serviges include distribution of naloxonie, säfer sex supplies, fentanyl test strips, collection and safe disposal of used syringes, and access to other crucial injection supplies as needed. The population HRCSCC propöses to reach is made up of hard-to-reach individuals not currently utilizing or underutilizing the county SSP.
HRÇSCC proposes operating at the following times and locations: Coral Street between Limekiln and River Streets on Sundays between the hours of 9 a.m. and 11.p.m. This iS the same location that HRGSCC has been providing services in collaboration with Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency's SSP for 18 months. The proposal also includes

Explanations:
There is unlikely to be an impact to aesthetics, due to the lact that HRCSCC has alceady been providing services at the Coral Street location for 18 months and the service plan for that localion is unchanged. The plan to add home delivery and pick up in the counly will increase disposal options for people unable to allend the fixed-site programs. Additionaly, CDPH will fund a dedicated litter clean-up team to mitigate any litter problems that currently exist in the county.
The Santa Cruz Health Services Agency Syringe Services Program is unable to go into the community to collect syringes. By contrast, HRCSCC volunteers have returned syringes to the counly from their öutreach aclivities ät the Coral Street location. By being in the community and having a dedicated team focused on syringe litter (collection) there is a likelihood that HRCSCC will collect fär more used syringes then dispensed as they will continue to collect syringes from people who have received their syringes from cther sources, Including the county.

L'ant a Santa Cruz resident who lives with my family within a block of' the Emeline County offices,
The Harm Reduction Coalition application for Santa Cruz.County should be donied. The county program alrcady has had a dramatic increase in the number of necdles distributed, while serving a REDUCED numborof elients. We do not have information on the nuniber of users, the number of people served, the number with: HepC or HIV, nor good counts of the number of neesiles collceted vs slistributed (uslimates vs aciual counts).

The major Naws in the HRC application are (A) it is a "needs based" distributiou model instead of niming for 1:1. This means they will continue to distribute to' clients and their coliçagues without controlling for lhc number of needies which are lost to the environmeot. This hoppens at the Same time that the county is moying to *reduce* their secondary exchange.

1 (B) The HRC will only offer rcferruts, and not offer lçath services which can actunlly improve thè lives of addicts.
(C) HRC will nat have dlata that integrated. into the county's statistics, so our understanding of the magnitude and oature of the problem will not be uniderstood.
(D) Giving out needles to help eurb the spread of HepC and HIV is doing *nothing* to address the rool eause of the pröblem, and ignores the affiction that is ruining these people's livés. Overdoses and discases arc ho symptoros of taddiction, and not the root cause. No number of needles will make these problems go away.
Scconday exchange at the county's own Syringe Services program has skyrocketed from 5% tecciving > 200 necdies in 2014 to 37% in 2018, including up to. 57% of the visits in mid-2018. These increnses are duo in part due to HRC efforts, We necd móre and better in formation, not a second program which increases the flow of untracked needles,

OVER 10,000 contaminated syringes found in less than a year. in our parks and beaches!!!
Thie Santa Cruz Sentinal reported on Decembor I1, 2019, OVER 6,000 syringes were found from July, 2018 through May, 2019. the Parks Department reported an additional 4,171 syringes found litering our parks and beaches in 2018!1! Here's the quote from the paper:
Available data shows the litter is primarily concentrated within the city of Santa Cruz, where more than 6,000-littered syringes were found in the downtown area from July 2018 to May of this year by the Downtown Streets Team, The city's Parks Department
roported collcoting an additional 4, 171 syringos in 2018.
"We have to do better," Santä Cruz resident Paige Concannon told superyisors Tuesday, rattling a plastic svater bottle filled with seven syringes she said she found during a single morning walk in her Seabright neighborhood. *This is insane."
The volunteer group seeks to distribute necdles throughout the county when it is clear the organization cannot be trusted, Major modifications to the program, folloxing the Washington D.C. example, need to be incorporated.
The weighing of retumed used needles for determining a onc-to-one exchange is hopclussly Nlawed. If there is a
ncudte distribution plan, it absolutaly must have a delinitive method to determine whether distributed needies and syringes are returned or exposing innocent people, particularly vulnerable, curious children on.our beaohes and.in
our parks.
The District of Columbia Code for needle distribution requires at § 48-1103.01(0, that all ncedios be: "identifiable through the use of permanent markings or color coding,...:' so that all needles and syringes distributed can be effectively identiffed.
If this ill-concoived program proceeds, such markings should be rcquired so that there is a definitive answer as to
whether the distributed needles are returned or ending up on oue streets, in our parks and on our beaches.
A link to the Distrlet of Columbia plan is found below:

htps:isioh.sle.gow/sitss/dehauluhles/skstsiteskloh/publicalion/nuachmentsido_code_needle_exchange_prpams.pdf
Further, 1he non-professionals advocating for the prögram are UNTRUSTWORTHY. The caslier opplication was
withdrawn when there was a public outcry and now a second sneaky attempt is being made.
If there is to bo a needle exchange, there will need to bo:

https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DQA/CDPH%20Document%2QLibrary/HRC
SCC%20SEP%20Application.pdf
Fixed distribution locations are too vague, and it is not apparent that there will be any significant loçal oversight, if there is any at all. If our community is going to continue to provide needles, I'd like to see inoré stringent control of the process, with residents able to havea say in the locations for distribution.

It seems totally unneeded and a public health hazard. Please stop this unsupervised give away by non- medical or metal health staff. These people need counseling along with a clean needle to get off the needlel Thank you for your consideration of our community.

write to you fo express my opposition to the HRC of SCC Secondary Syringe Exchange Program application, and also to provide direct evidence of the lengths ta which the program's representatives, including and especially Denise Elerick, are willing to go in order to push this program onto our community, despite overwheiming opposition,
I happen to live near Ms. Blerick, and she and I are both members of an online community called Nextdoor. Because we're in the same "neighborhood" she can see and respond to my posts. Recently I started a post urging my neighbors to express to you their opposition fo, the HRC application during this public comment poriod.
As expected based on her past behavior, Denise chimed in on this post, and used it to promulgate a literal raft of lies and. misinformation, including (and most egregiously) that händing out thousands of needles per month in the city and county of Santa Cruz has not contributed to the large and growing needle litter problems we are experiencing. A probiem so bad, that there's a Faccbook group devoted tö the topic https://www.facebook.com/NcedesSolutionsTeam/.
Lam attaching a set of screenshots that I took today which, together, contain the entirety of the thread that I started, including alt of the posts that were made by Denise. I apologize for the number of images, but it was a fairly long thread (thanks mostly to Denise's rambling. commentary) and Nextdoor's site doesn't allow. you to save or print them. The soreenshots are. in order from l-12. Aftor reading Denise's contributions to that thread (highlighted), I'm sure you can sce how the concerns of the community, which have been raised on multiple occasions, are blithely ignored by Denise. This is not the person that should be running this
program.

Many of us recognize the need for a needle exchange program that does not simply enable addicts in their addiction. Santa Cruz County already has one, in fact. I have written on several occasions to my local county supervisor urging that they expand the existing county. rup program so that sve cap halp to ensure thè hcalih of these addicts, while also giving them other options than to continuc to use. If you approve the HRÇ application whatever incentives the board of supervisors imight have to provide additional resources tó their program. Thät will only further damage the futures of the addicts, but also of the community at large. urge you in the strongest terms to deny the application.
Thank you for your consideration.

To Califomia Department of Publio Iéalth,
I aus writing this letter to volee my opposition to the state supporting a needle distribution program by private entity flanm Reduction Coolitfori.
1 am n Santa Criz County resident, and I would like-to report a needle stick injury I recgived at the parking tot at Cowell's Beach on September 29, 2019, I stepped on a slirty noedle, presumably used for heroin, while l was with my two young daughicrs taking a surf lesson with a locil surf school.
Aner the injuiry, l went to an urgent care elinic where l'was tested for hiIV, Hepatilis B, and Ilepatitis C. I was hy-lested after 6 weiks, 3 months, and will ba retested 6 manths, and one year later. Althaugh the risk of contmeting HIV, Hep B, or tep Eis low, it is not non- existeni. Thankfully, all tusts show no infection so far.

I leamed scveral things fom this injury:

1. Sanlo Cruz County does not track necdle stick injuries.

2. Children are the most likely victims of necdle stick injuries. In fact, the urgent care physician recently treated an entire family of young chifdren who passed around a ncedlo that the kids had lound in the sand. i ean understand this. Kids are drawn to shiny pbjects.

3. Sania Cruz County may soon have a necdlc distribution program for drug users, administered by the private entity calfed The Harm Reduction Coalition, without tracking the unintended consequences. This necalle distribution program'is endorsed by retired physician Dr. Amold Leff. Vice Mayor Justin Cummings and Coutcilwoman Sandy Brown.

4, Necdle stick injuries are more common than I'would haye thought in our county. One of my ca-worker'#5 y/o danghter Annalise Dolder also had a needle stick injury at Capitola Beach on' 7/12/17. She did not report it as she felt reporting was futile. Another frichd's son atso had a necdle stick at Mnin.Beach in Santa Cruz during the summer of 2016. His name is Kacl Losick. l'am surc thar diere are many other families affected by this.

We nced to keup our public spaces cléan for our children, our visitors, and our cammunity. Plcaso make positive changes for our community, I wrotg this letter because I do not want another child or family to step on dirty needle at our beaches due lo our county ond state's incompaence in maintaining public safety. Let's.get pur heads out of the sand, Santa Cruz,

Sincerely,

Applicatlon Evaluation Team,
I am wriling to you today to volce my opposilion to the recent "Harm Reduotion" appllcation to distribute syrnges In Santa Cruz County. Santa Cruz County bffers a Syringe Services Program (SSP), where used syrnges can be relurned and nöw clean syringes obtained. In my view additional free whealing organizations offerinig syringe sefvices äre redundant.
The fact that addltional servicea would be redundant is not the only.reason [ oppose a non-medjcal distribulion of syringes. At oür couhly rün SSP, an addici is offered professional services, both medical services and drug dependency i.e. recovery counsellng. This new "Harm Reductlon* proposal offers nelther and would in effect reduce the number of drug dependen individuals recelving medical attenlion and drug counseling thereby causing more harm to the population it purporls to servè.

As it slands our county SSP has oversighl and Is. accountable lo the county residents and board of suporvisors and produces pubiicly avallable reports and statistics, whife the "Harm Reductión" folks offer neither reports or accountability.
Please add my voice to those.opposing the Elérick "Härm Reductlon" application.

The County of Santa Oruz runs a Syringe Services Program that last year handed out 593,174* needles to 578 IV drug users.
l oppose the Harm Reduction Coalition of Santa Cruz County's (HRCSCC)
application dated November 20, 2019, for an expanded Syringe Service Program in
the City of Santa Crüz and for mobile delivery services across the entire county. Our
Cily and County are already overflowing with discarded syringes in parks, on the
streets, and in our neighborhoods. We ask that you allow our locally elected leaders
to continue to manage and operate our locally authorized Syringe Services Program
(SSP) and deny the HRCSCÇ's application. Please deny this application and defer to
lacal authorities to continue their operation of a professionally managed County SSP
with local oversight and accountability.

The Santa Cruz County Health Services Agency currently operates its own SSP that
is subject to substartial community oversight. This proposed application by the
unsupervised volunteer group would create a program with little oversight,
control and accountability for the delivery of Health and Safety Programs within
our community. Santa Cruz County officials have expressed a commitment to
increase SSP program transparency and to increase drug and alcohol treatment
programs. This request for State SSP Certification by an all-volunteer organization
would directly impact the County's ability to professionally manage and serve those in
need. furge you to oppose this request.

Furthermore, this is the seoond HRÇSCC application requesting State Certification to
operate a SSP program independent of the County's. SSP. As you know, the
HRCSCC withdrew their prior application after widespread opposition by Community
Leaders, every Law Enforcement in the County, and Neighborhood Groups, as welf:
as due to numerous inaccuracies in the HRCSCC application itself. Nonetheless,
without any notable communily outreach or coordination with the County, HRCSCC

00213

has submilted a second application for State authorization. Furthermore, this most
recent request seeks to operate a mobile delivery service across the entire County.
Therefore, I also oppose the most recent HRGSCC application because lhis proposed
project in inconsistent with California environmiental qualily regulations.
Please do-not grant this application and instead respect local Santa Cruz County SSP
program management's authority to maintain SSP operations under the oversight of
the Santa Cruz County Board of Superyisors.
Thank you for your time, Rebecca Rubin

To Whom it May Gonçern:
I am writing to express my opposition to the Harm Reduction Coalition of Santa Cruz County (HRC) application for the syringe exchange program for needle distribution. Since the County already administers a needle program, I agree with the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors, which unanimously advised against this program.
More specifically; I am concerned about: 1) the broad scope of needle distribution, 2) lack of local. oversight, and 3) expansion with the state's permission without further
important notice.

Overly Broad Scope of Needle Distribution f understand that HRC withdrew its previous application after neighborhood groups expressed outrage in response to specific locations listed. HRG's new application, however, has carefully crafted the language to Inolude only one specifio location (on Coral Street near the existing homëless services center). However, the rest of their services will be mobile, county-wide, and in any place in the County "where the participants llve." I am concerned that the application could be interpreted so broadly as to include; for example, the Ross Camp. The HRC was giving out up to 600 needles per day to the occupants who lived there. When the Camp was closed, City workers had to cleant up thousands of dirty needles. There are countless other looations where people "live" that could become syringe delivery sites.

No More Local Oversight 1 understand that, under Cal. California Health & Safety Code Section 121349 et seq., syringe sorvice programs (SSP's) can be authorized either by local government or by the State. I'm concerned that if the SSP is authorized by the state as the HRC is requesting, there is NO local oversight. When, however, an SSP is authorized by local government (such as our County-run SSP), it is subject to local ovèrsight, and is required to allow public comment and present a biennial report at an open Board of
Supervisors meeting.
Expansion with State's Permission without Local Notice
Once the state approves an SSP is approved by the Statè, the Stäte can "administratively approve" changes to the SSP' operations, "including; but not limited to, modifications to the time, location, and type of services provided." (Health and

00215

Safety Code Section 121349(h)). The State dœes NOT have ta give notice to law enforcement, the county's public health officer, or the public to make these changes. I'm concerned that, while the HRC left off specific fixed locations at this time, they could simply ask the State for an amendment and those wha might be affected would not even be informed of this potential change to express opposition.
For these reasons, I request the state reject HRC's current application for needle distribution.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,

Elena N. Cohen

Councit Members and California Department of Publio Health,
am a resident of' the city of Santa Gruz and I oppose the ficensing of an unregulated needle distribution to the Hamm Reduction Coalition.

Our community has struggled with 4 persistent syringe lilter problem for many years and a new syringe program that is not a to l exchange is likoly to exacerbate that problem, Santa Cruz County's Syringe Services Program distributed close to 600,000 syringe's this past year to' injection dnig users and is already mecting the need for clean syringos for this population ns evidenced by years of relatively stable diseaso rates. The County's Syringo Services Program also provides-enhanced accoss to ircatment and testing that injection drug users will not be able to easily access it fIRC's application is approyed and elients are drawn away from the County's program. In.addition, HRC's proposed location, adjacent to the County'sonly lamily shelter, is inappropriate and would create, further. community impacts fo our miost vulnerable residents.

Santa Cnuz County alrcady operatcs à robust, professionally-nun Syringe Services Program, A ncw voluntcer-run syringe program with no local oversighränd muttiple potential negative impacts to our community is unnocessary. aud should be opposed by the Soard. You can help by urging other Bonrd mensbers, the State, and the Health Services Agency (HSAj to take the community's concerns setiously.

I am opposed to tho current application of the Harm Reduction Coalition of Santa Cruz Counly to distribute syringes. As Harms Reductión prograin in proventing intectious diseases, primarily II1V, Iep C and flep B, it-can be helpful to provide starile syringes. Howevet there are sevcral very elfective cures for Hepatitis C and mony eficolive treatments for. HIV that can also prevent the spread of these diseases, even among injection drug using persons. The program does nothing to reduce the tise of illegal drugs, whose impact on both the local community as well as the internationgl communities involved in the drug procuryment and distribution is tragio. Likewise it does nol address the rising incidence of drug overdose and increasing fatalities. The Horms Reduction syringe disfribution progmm docs not extend to the many peoples.here and abrond whose lives are forever altered or lost by the illegal drug cartels, including murdcis, environmental destruction, and other barns. Only by combining syringe programs with an intensive effort to orcourage and help peopla stop using drugs with the use of medication assisted therapies, getting tested for infections diseases, and on Ireatment where appropriate, can true liarms reduction be achieved, The simple supplying of syringes does nothing to curtail the deaths and tragedies of the opiod/meth epidemics, and should not be supported absent of a comprchensive program, such as Counties can provide, to deal with ihe on- going crisis.

yould like to state that I rarely have time for involvement in anything remotely related to governmeht as I'm juggling three young children. I think that this is the sentiment of many parents of young children. It's self inflicted underrepresentation.
That said, Iam taking time for THIS. I believe I stand for most of the parents in Santa Cruz County when I say that.I am wholchcartedly against expanding any syringe delivery programs. I, like so many, have found my three ycar old holding a ricedle that she found at the laundry mat. We find them in gardens, along sidewalks, at the beach. We are no longer able to enjoy our community for fcar of blood born illness. These programs äre orcated tò protect individuals who are victims of addiction but they are quite directly affecting children and families of the community in very real ways. That doesn't even include the massive toll on the environment. The risk is families and the environment is not justified by the roward to addicts. would be more than happy to bring my three kiddos and have them talk about the dozens of times they have had to say "momnmy plcaso pick up that needlo so that I.can play here.' As I sald, parents of young children are very underreptesented and are some of the most directly affected by thesc programs, but hopefully that will change!

On Thu, May 23, 2019, 9:34 AM Patrick Mulhearn <Palrick.Mulheam@sanlacruzcounty.us> wrote: Lguess this is moot now, but por your request:

Dear California Department of Public Health:
am writing regarding the application from the Harm Reduction Coalition (Road Show) in Santa Cruz County Iam a Santa Cruz County Supervlsor, representing the 2nd District, which includes parts of the cities of Watsonville and Capitola as well as much of the unincorporated area in the inid and south
county areas,

I write in opposition of the application and also wanted to provide some. additional context to my opposition. As you can imagine, this application has received a lot of attention and has, unfortunately, brought a negative reflection not just upon the proposed program but undeservedly upon the greater County run program as well. Long torm supporters of needle exchange programs have come out strongly against this application and, based on the phone calls, emalls
and comments I recéive while out in the community, many traditional supporters
of public health programs are also questioning why this is being considered.
This is unfortunate because the one thing that seems to be universally agreed upon is the need to have a program that is managed with access to other wraparound services. Such a program would traditionally be run by the County with connections to other health services, transparency and responsibilities for proper disposal and removal of any needle waste. However, in this climate the County is unable to engage in any sort of dialogue regarding ways in which the current program can be improved while this application is being considered for approval. Additionally, should the program be approved, It's clear that the current County program will be difficult to separate from this independent program by the greater community. Any resultant laok of transparency, Inpreaso in heedle waste, public health impacts or other impacts will reflect back upon the County program. 1 have concerns that any atlempts to improve upon the current County program will be nearly impossible to implement in that context - and understandably so.
These programs should be run and managed by County Health where the community can have confidence that all public needs, from reduction of communicable diseases to roducing nèodle waste to reducing the number of those addicted are met. If this application were to be approved, I believe that the overall confidence in the value of the current County needle exchange program wil! be undermined. Given the difficulty that these programs operate in already, having one run by an indopendent group, without the same elected official Översight, public reporting and opportunities for community input will mean à gröater erosion of suppört for this type of public health program moving forward.

Dear SEP Administrator:
I am wondering if you can assist me with a couple of questions about syringe exchange programs
("SEPS").
1 Does the Department of Public Health ("Department") publish comments received during the
public comment period for SEP applications and the Department's responses to chose
comments?
California Department of Public Health does not publish the public comments received. To request copies of public comments an individual must submit a public records request through
the Department's portal - https://cdph.govga.us/WEBAPP/_rs/(S(04dpm.1qt4xm10geapxtaQw//SupportHome.aspx 2. Does the Department publish findings or statements of decision for SEP applications?
Once a decisión has been made, the Department post the letter to the applicant on the Office of AiDS website. In some instances an FAQ is also posted providing additional information.
https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DOA/Pages/OA_pirev_decuapp.aspx
3,j Has the Department evaluated the applicability of CECA to SEP approvals? Does the
Department publish a notice of exemption or à notice of determination under CECA for local
SEPs?
For SEPs approved by the California Department of Public Health since November 2019, the
Department does a prellminary checklist to assess whether CEQA applles and also if any CEQA
exemptions apply. The Department does not publish a notice of exemption or notice of
determination. The checklist is also available through a public records act request.

The respondent has a clear, present, and ministerial duty to act in € particufar way; and Petilioner has a clear, present and beneficial right to performance of that duty. County of San Diego y. State (2008) 164 Cal. App. 4th. 580, 593. In a traditional mandamus proceeding, the question of abuse of discretion tums not on whether the agency's findings are supported by substantial evidence (as with a writ of administrative mandamus), but whether the agency's action wäs arbitrary or capricious. Bright Development.vy. Clty of Tracy (1993) 20 Cal. App. 4th 783, 795.
Pelitioner arques that OCNEP's apolication to oberate the SEP was Insuffelent and defeotive ln mullipte respects such thal. CDPH had a ministerial duty to fefect the application. Generally, mandamus is available to compel. a public agency's performance or to correct an agency's abuse of discretion when the action being compelled or correated ls ministerial. AIDS Healthcare Foundation y. Los Angeles County Dept. of Public Health (2011) 197 Cal, App. 4th 693, 700. "A ministerial act is an act that a public officer s required to perform In a prescribed manner in obediencè to the mandate of legal authority and without regard to his own Judgment or opinion concerning such acl's proprlety or Improprlety, when a given state of facts exists. Discretion, on the other hand, is the power conferted on pubilc functtonarles to act officially according to the dictates of their own judgment." Rodriquez v. Solis (1991) 1 Cal, App, 4th 495, 501, 502. Mandamus does not lle to compél a public agency to exercise discretionary powers In a particular manner, only to compel It to exercise. Its disoretion in some manner. AIDS Heallhoare Foundation v. Los Angeles County Dept of Public Health, supra at 701. Whether a

+ particular statutory scheme impose a ministerial duty, for which mandamus will lle, or a mere obligation to perform a discretionary function is a question of statufory interpretation. Id. The Court must examine the language, funotion and apparent purpose of the statutes. Ld. Although the term "shall" ls defined as mandatory for purposes of the Government Code (§ 14); the term does not. necessarlly create a mandatory duty. Caliorata Pubtlo Records Research. Incrw. County of Yolo (2016) 4 Cal. App. 5th 150, 178 Even ii mandatory language appears in a statute creating a duty, the duty is discretionary if the public entity must exercise significant Iscretlon to perform the duty. 1d. Thus, in addition to examining the statutory language, the Court must examine the entire statutory scheme tò determine whether the public. entity has disoretion to perform a mandatory duty. Ld. "Here, though sactlons 27360 and 27366 require the Board to charge and set copy fees, the Board must exercise significant discretion in deciding how much to charge. Nelther statute requires thè Board tó set feas in any particular amount" Id Mandamus will not lle to control an exercise of discretion, i.e., to compel an officlal to exetoise discretion In à particular manner. Mooney V. Gardla (2012) 207 Cal. App. 4th 229, 232, Generally, mandamus may only be employed to compel the performance of a duty that is purely ministeral In character. Id. at 232-233. Mandate will not lssue if the duty is not plain or is mixed with disoretlonay power or the exerciso of judgment. Id. at 233.
Health and Safety Code sections 121349 et seq. is the statutory scheme that authorizes a SEP in any clty or county for the stated purpose of reducing the spread of HlV Infection and hepatitis among the intravenous drug user population. The State Department of Public Heallh may aulhorize entities "to: apply for authorization under this chapter to provide hypodermlo needle and syringe exchange services conststent with state standards ...' Health & Saf. Code 121349(0).. The authorization to operate a SEP "shall be made after consultation with the local health offlcer and local law enforcement leadership, and after a period of public comment •** lo. making the determinatlon, the department shall balance the concerns of law enforcement with the public health beneflts." Health & Saf. Code 121349(c). The overall process involves consultation and balancing such that CDPH officlals are required to exercise Judgment. Thus, the process is inherently discretionary,
The Department of Public health has promulgated regulations governing the operation of SEPs, See 17 C. C. R. 7000, et seq. An application to operate a SEP must include a "Syringe Collection and Disposal Plan as described in Sectión 7012(b)r 17 C. C. R. 7002(a)(10)(B). A certified SEP must include a "syrnge collection and sharps waste disposal plan." 17 C. C. R. 7012(b). This disposal plan must: (1) be designed to maximize retum áf used syringes without Increasing risk of neediestiok Injury to staff or program participants; (2) track the number of syringes réturned in à manner that eliminatés direct handting of sharps waste and does not interfere with service provision; (3) include a needlestick.

familar with state. law regulating proper disposal of sharps waste as referenced in Heallh and Safety Code Section 118286; and. (5) Include a plan and budget for sharps waste disposal. Id. "Needlestick Injury Protocol means poltoles and procedures, In adherence with the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration protocol as provided (n. Callfornia Code of Regulations, Titte 8, Sectlon 5198, to prevent needlestick injury to SEP staff, Including volunteers, and to SEP participants, and that outline both immedlate and subsequent remedial and prophylactic actions to take in the event of a needlestick InJury.* 17 C. C. R. 7000(a)(16). The applicant/employer müst have a "Exposure Control Plan" with specifled requirements. 8 C. C. R. 5193(c)(1) Also, sharps contalners cannot be opened or accessed. ld. at (d)(3)(B). Health & Safety code section 118286 (referenced within regulatory code saction 7012(b)) sets forth requirements for the proper disposal and transportation of sharps waste.
In contrast to-section 121349(c), a portíon of the applicable. regulation uses language that upon first Impression appears to be mandatory in nature. Section 7004 states as follows:
"The department shall reject an application if any of the following deficiandles exist: "(a) Information submitted in the application is incorrect or Incomplete, "(b). The applicant doas not meet all the requirements Ilsted in Health and Safety Code Section 121349. "(c) Evidence of projected harm to public safety, presented by looal law enforcement officlal(s), is, In the department's judgment, greater than evidence of projected benefits to public health,"
17 C. C. R. 7004.
Clearly, subsection 7004(c) invoives discretionary: judgment. Potentially; subsectlons (a) and (b) describe a mandatory duty to reject an application if it contains incorrect information, is incomplete or does not. "mee" the statutory requirements. Presumably, this minlsterial duly arises upon the Initial submission of the application, before consultations, public comment or balancing takes place. In reality, however, section 7004 does not create a mandatory duty, but simply refers back to the discretlonary duties. outiined within sectión 121349, As. discussed above, the "requirements" set forth within subsection 121849(c) are consultalions and the balancing of harms. Section 121349(d) does not set forth bright line requirements, but instead requires the appilcant to "demonstrate" that It "complles with all of the following minimum standards." A demonstration of compllance necessarily entails the exercise of judgment by CDPH officlals; L.e., a discretionary decision as to the sufficiency of any" such demonstratlon. Specifically, subsection (d)(1) requires the applicant to demonstrate that it, directly ör through referral, provides drug ábuse treatment services, HIV or hepatitis screening, hepatitis vaccinations, screening for sexually transmitted infections, housing services for the homeless, and "services related to provision of eduçation and materials for the reduction of sexual risk behaviors.' Whether the applicant's services in this regard are sufficient involves a discretionary judgment. These Is not simply a "check the box" requirements. The sufficiency of these services is dependent on various extemnal factors, and is determined on a case-by-case basis after thoughtful and discretionary evaluation by publio. officials.
Similarly, subsection (d)(2) sets forth a requirement that the applicant "demonstrate" that it "has the capacity to commence needle and syringe exchange services within three months öf authorization." Subsection (d)(3) entails a linding that the applicant is adequately funded. Both of these entail a discrettoriary decislon: deciding what constitutes adequate capaclty and sufficient funding. Both are subject to the Judgment of CDPH officials. Subsection (d)(4) sets forth a requirement that the applicant demonstrate tthe capacity,: and an established pian, ta collect evaluative data in order to assess program Impact, Agaln, whether the applicant can collect and complle this data is subjeot to the judgment of CDPH officials.
Petitioners cite Regulatory Code section 7002(a)(5)(C), which refers to a description of the proposed syringe exchange services that includes SEP services that "prövide for the safe recovery and disposal of used syringes and sharps waste from all of its participants." Whether the application provides for safe recoyery and disposal is a determination of disoretlonary judgment In which CDPH personnel must make

CASE TITLE; COUNTY OF ORANGE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT VS CASE NUMBER; 37-2018-00039176-CU-MC-CTL OF
a reasoned decislon, In fact, the application (Ex. 4) does contain a statement describing the handling and disposal of used syringës, Also, the subject application specfically states that OCNEP. "staff will be educated as to the sharps requlrements oullined in Health and Safety Code 118286.9 Also, the avallable evidence appears to demonstrate that OCNEP protocol does not permit its volunteers to open sharps contalners or to touch needles, In addition, It is för the CDPH to determine, in its discretion, whether the needlestick Injury protocol ls sufficient to prevent needtestick infury. Finally, it is it disputed whether Séctión Vll of the version. of the application submlitted to CDPH includes the required attestations. Separate Slatement nos. 33 and 34.
In sum, the premise for this cause of action ls flawed such that summary adjudication In favor of Plalntiffs must be denled. "Wher a court revlews a public antides' decision for an abuse of discretion, the court may not subslitute Its judgment for that of the public entity, and If reasonable minds may disagree as to the wisdom of thé publlc entity's discretionary determination, that decision must be upheld." California Public. Records Rasearch, Ino._V. County of Stanislaus (2016) 246 Cal. App, 4th 1432, 1443. Also, greater' deference should be given to an agenoy's interpretalion where the agency has expertise and technical knowledge, especially where the legal text to be interpreted ts technical, obscure, complex, open-ended, or. entwined with issues of fact, pollcy, and discretion. Cllizens for Beach Rights .v. City of San Diedo (2017) 17 Çal. App. 5th 230,.241. In this case, reasonable minds may differ as to the wisdom of CDPH's. decislon to approve the subject appilcation for operation of the moblle SEP, Speoifically, reasonable differences may exist regarding the manner in which OCNEP accounts. for and disposes of used sÿringes, However, tfere ls no evidence that the Department committed an abuse of disaretion In making this discretionary determination, and its dlscretionary decision is entitled to deference.
Plainilffs also argue that CDPH's administrative amendments Were improper such that the application is deficlent. However, Hoaith and Salely Code section 121349(h) appears to permit CDPH to amend the authorization. This subsection provides: "If the department, In its discretion, determines that a state authorized syringe exchange program continues to meet all standards set forth in subdivision (d) and that a public health need exists, it may administratively approve amendments to a program's operations Including, but.not limited to, modifications to the time, location, and type of services provided, Including the designationi as a fixed site of a mobile site. The amendment approval shall not be subject to the noticing requirements of subdivision (e)." In addition, Plaintiff falls to clte authority for the propositión that an unauthorized amendment requires CDPH to deny the application in totah

CEQA establishes a three-ller process to ensure that public agendles informt their decisions with environmental conslderationa. County of Ventura.v. City of Moorpark (2018) 24 Cal.

If the prolect is not exempt and may cause alanioant environmental effents. however; the agency must propare an environmental Impact report (EIR). Id. There is no requtrement that an ágency put Its exemption decision in writing at any time, and the Guidelines expressly provide that nottce of a categorical exemption determination not only need not, but should not be given until after the project is approved. Robinson v. City and County of San Francisco (2012) 208 Cal. App. 4th 950, 961 (clting 14 C. C. R. ("Guldelines") § 15062).

Respondent argues that its operation of the mobile SEP ls "emporary," and analogous to the operation. of a camival. Even assuming it is reasonable tö compare the potentiat for discarded, used syrnges to. the garbage associated with a camival, and thus characterize "sharps waste" as minor, OCNEP's operations are not "temporary" in nature. A camnival comes to town perhaps once per year for a few days or weeks, then packs up and leaves. The authorization issued by the CDPH permitted the needle® exchange to operate in four citles dudrig multiple hours, six days per week for a period of two years.

Conversely, an indirect effeot is not reasonably foreseeable if thore is no causal connection between the proposed activity and the suggested environmental change or if the postulated causal mechanism connecting the activily and the effect is so aftenuated as to be 'speculative..." Id. (Internal citations omittad), In applying this rule, the Supreme Court continued:
"Applying the foregoing test, we concludé the City erred in determining that the adoption of the Ordinance was not a project, Prior to the Ordinance, no medical marluana dispensaries were legally permitted to operate in the City. The Ordinance therefore amended the City's zaning regulations to permit the establishment of a sizable number of retall businesses of an entirely new type. Although inconsistency with prior permissible land uses is not necessary for an activity to constitute a project establishment of these new businesses is capable of causing Indirect physical changes in the environment, At a minimum, such a policy change could foreseeably result In new retall construction to accommodate the businesses. In addition, as UMMP suggests, the establishment of new stores could cause a citywide change in patterns of vehicle traffc from the businesses* customers, employees, and suppliers. The necessary causal connection between the Ordinance and these effects is present because adoption of the Ordinance was 'an essential step culminating in action tthe establishment of new businesses] which may affect the envlronment.* (Fullerton Joint Union High School Dist. y. State Board of Education (1982) 32 Cal. 3d 779, 797.) The theoretical effects mentioned* above are sufficiently plausible to raise the possibility that the Ordinance 'may cause ... a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment' (§ 21065), warranting its consideration as à project.'

This conslitgles a tangible change in the areas surounding operaton Öf the SEP. in addition, the application acknowledges that OCNEP will serve ar estimated 10,000 ciients between four sites in Orange County, operating daily between the hours of 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. This activity is capable of causing environmental Impacts on the basis that the mobile seivice will attract and cause car trips; l.e., transportation and circulation' impacts to the areas where the SEP is operating. Thus, the activity approved through the CDPH.authorization-is a "projeot" subject to CEQA revisw.
