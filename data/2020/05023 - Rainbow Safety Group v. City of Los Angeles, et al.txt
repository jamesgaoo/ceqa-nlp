VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Petitioner, RAINBOW SAFETY GROUP ("Petitioner"), alleges through this Verified
2 Petition for Writ of Mandate and Complaint ("Petition"), as follows:
INTRODUCTION 3

4 1. Petitioner challenges the approval by the City of Los Angeles ("City" or
5 "Respondent") of a Mitigated Negative Declaration ("MND") and the related approvals and

0 permits designed to facilitate a four house development project proposed at 430 West Avenue
7 45, and 437, 441 and 451 West Rainbow Avenue, Los Angeles, CA (together, the "Project").

8 The approvals were granted to Real Party in Interest, Abode Lumber Corporation by and through
9 its Chief Executive Officer, Don S. Kain.

10 2. The consistent failures of the City to provide, in this era of telecommunications

11 and coronavirus, easily provided mailed or emailed actual notice of its actions to persons whose 8 LIZ06 2108 VANS Channel Law Group, LLP 12 constitutionally protected property, health and safety interests might be affected by an
13 extraordinary real estate development project, are troubling. As set forth in more detail below, in
SI!H Beverly 14 1968-1969 the Project site suffered a massive creeping landslide of steeply sloped bedrock that BJIJYSIIM E888 15 destroyed eleven homes and Rainbow Avenue. While the site was graded after the landslide
16 finally stopped, the site is not a competent location to place the weight of new construction until
17 the safety of surrounding properties and Rainbow Avenue are secured. This reality is reflected in
18 the City Council's 1979 downplanning of the General Plan's land use designation from Low

19 Residential to Minimum Residential, and correspondingly downzoning the lots from R1 to RE-

20 40 - effectively requiring not more than one house on this geologically unstable site. Even the
21 City Council recognized the seriously deficient geologic conditions at the site by reducing its
22 authorized density by law from 4 to 1.
23 3. In 2005, a previous speculation developer, Jesus Reyes, proposed a four-house
24 project on this same site. The record here establishes that City Planners upon presentation of the
25 2005 Project by Mr. Reyes were willing to try to process the project with a categorical
26 exemption under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") - no environmental
27

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

review and public comment process at all. Despite objections of constitutionally affected
2 landowners at that time, City Planners approved the project without any environmental review.
3 On appeal to the East Los Angeles Planning Commission, City Planners persisted in their claims
that no environmental review was required - recommending that the appeal of the local Mount
Washington Homeowners Alliance be denied outright. The Planning Commissioners were

6 incensed at the City's callous disregard of the public's right to know the facts and expert analysis
about the landslide, and an ability to test its veracity with CEQA's public review, comment, and

8 participation process.

4. In an unprecedented and rare action for Mount Washington, the Planning

10 Commissioners of that time went to the trouble to draft their own substituted findings that the

11 case file record established the existence of unusual circumstances and cumulative construction 8 d77 5dnoJ5 MET jeuueuo LIZ06 12 and pedestrian children impacts on the substandard roadways surrounding the Project site. Based
13 upon these findings, the Commission found that the City was required to have conducted an 8 euns "pAIa BUIlySIIM €8E8 'SI!H Beverly 14 initial study to determine what level of environmental review other than exemption from CEQA

15 was lawful. Additionally, the Planning Commissioners observed in their substituted findings that
16 the entire project concept of jamming four houses instead of one on the Project site, consistent
17 with the Northeast Community Plan Land Use Designation and applicable RE-40 zoning, was
18 fatally flawed. Mr. Reyes, apparently unwilling to undertake the environmental review the

19 Planning Commission said was required, never further pursued the Project.
20 5. Subsequently, another speculation developer, Abode Lumber, acquired the project
Mr. Reyes left off. City Planners again began processing the case as 21 and picked up where
22 requiring no environmental review under a categorical exemption. In a troubling set of events
23 from the outset, the City Planners in charge of review of this revised Project failed to enforce a
24 critical public noticing requirement of the local specific plan that requires posting of a sign
25 indicating a land use application has been filed at City Hall. Later, although City Planners
26 determined the Project could not be processed under CEQA without any environmental review,
27

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

pursuant to certain patterns and practices of the City Planning Department, they refused to
2 provide any mailed or emailed actual notice of the circulation of a proposed Mitigate Negative
3 Declaration to persons whose constitutionally protected property, health, and safety interests
4 were endangered by the landslide condition of the property. Giving only the barest notice in a
single publication in tiny typeface in the print edition (not the online version) of the Los Angeles

6 Times, the City's failures obtained a result that could be reported later to City officials: No one
7 cared enough to submit comments during CEQA's official public review and comment period.

8 Of course, this was not true. The persons who might care, and who were constitutionally entitled
to notice of the project application under the Specific Plan, and notice of the release of the MND

10 for public review and comment, appear to have been purposely left in the dark until it was too

11 late to participate fully in CEQA's statutory public participation process.
Channel Law Group, d77 0SL OUNS "PAIE eJUSIM €8€8 LLZ06 12 6. Within this problematic context, Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set
13
8 aside, rescind and void all of the permits and approvals ("Project Approvals") adopted by the
Beverly 'SI!H 14 City in order to facilitate the Project. The Project was finally approved by the City of Los
15 Angeles on or about March 17, 2020. Petitioner requests that the Court vacate the Project
16 Approvals because Respondent failed to comply with the provisions set forth under the
17 California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA"),
18| provisions of the California and U.S. Constitution, the State Planning and Zoning Law, and local
19 laws and therefore failed to proceed in a manner required by law.
20 7. Petitioner additionally seeks declaratory and injunctive relief barring Respondent
21 City's pattern and practice of giving notice of the availability of environmental documents such
22 as the MND in this case only in the Los Angeles Times printed newspaper, failing to mail or
23 email actual notice of release of environmental documents for review and comment to those with
24 constitutionally protected rights, and failing to distribute to public agencies and make available
25 on its website all of the supporting technical studies that support the City's decision to consider
26 adoption of an exemption, negative declaration or mitigated negative declaration. Such notice
27

practices of the City, as to persons adjacent to or likely adversely affected by a project, is not a

2 method of notice reasonably calculated to result in actual notice of the availability of

3 environmental documents for review and comment. Additionally, even if somehow a member of

4 the public learns that a proposed negative declaration or a MND is posted on the City's website,
5 the failure of the City to consistently post all supporting technical studies as well, particularly

6 during a time of pandemic where (for the foreseeable future) a visit to City Hall to inspect a

7 physical file places vulnerable members of the public at unnecessary risk to their health and
8 safety, improperly thwarts CEQA's public participation mandate. As a result of these patterns
9 and practices, contrary to minimum notice requirements of the California and U.S. Constitutions
10 and the public's paramount interest in CEQA's public participation process, the City often

8 11 successfully discourages or prevents submission of comments during CEQA's statutorily MET jouueuo 'dnomg d77 -+Z06 12 mandated public comment period. These practices should be barred by the Court in a declaratory

8 euns "paig eJlys|!m €s€8 13 judgment determining the rights of the parties and the interested public.
PARTIES 'SIH Áuereg 14

15 8. Petitioner, RAINBOW SAFETY GROUP, is an unincorporated association
16 dedicated to the protection of both the community and the environment of the Rainbow Canyon
17 area of Los Angeles's Mount Washington neighborhood. Petitioner and its respective members
18 have a direct and substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondent complies with the

19 environmental protection laws of the state, the City's General Plan Northeast Community Plan,
20 the Mount Washington/Glassell Park Specific Plan, the Los Angeles Municipal Code, and the
21 provisions of the California and United States Constitutions. Petitioner and its respective
22 members are adversely affected by Respondent's failure to comply with CEQA in approving the
23 Project. Petitioner has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because Petitioner and

24 its members' property, personal health/safety, and environmental interests are directly and
25 adversely affected by Respondent's actions leading up to and including approval of the Project.

8 acting by and through its Chief Executive Officer, DON S. KAIN, is the applicant and developer is
of the Project. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of additional Real Parties

15 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

16 11. This Court has jurisdiction over the writ action under section 1094.5 of the Code
17 of Civil Procedure, and sections 21168 and 21168.5 of the Public Resources Code.
18 12. This Court also has jurisdiction over the traditional mandamus action under
19 section 1085 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

20 13. This Court also has jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment action under
21 section 1060 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

22 14. Venue for this action properly lies in the Los Angeles Superior Court because
23 Respondent and the Project are located in Los Angeles County pursuant to Code of Civil
24 Procedure § 394. §
25 FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS

26 15. The Project proposes to construct four single-family homes on four contiguous
27

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

lots where the Los Angeles Genera Plan - Northeast Community Plan and the RE-40 zoning
2 classification only a permits a single house. These lots were downplanned by the City in the 1979
3 Northeast Community Plan, and downzoned to match in 1988-1990 as part of the City's General

4 Plan Consistency Program under a consent decree supervised by Department 86 of this Court.
5 16. The Rainbow Canyon area of the Los Angeles neighborhood of Mount

6 Washington, and the area served by a Rainbow Avenue, is a steep, rustic wooded area with a street a
7 access system that operates as the equivalent of a one-lane road as narrow as 11 feet. Due to its

8 steep canyons and slopes, the area is designated as a High Fire Hazard Severity Zone, the state's
most vulnerable official designation of fire risk. In 1968/1969, a land mass containing the four
10 subject lots, which at the time were developed with homes, was involved in a massive creeping

11 landslide after heavy rainfall infiltrated the tilted bedrock underlaying this area. Over the course 8 d71 'dnoJo MET jauueug 41Z06 12 of several weeks, approximately 11 homes were destroyed, and other nearby homes damaged, as
13 the tilted bedrock formation slowly slid toward and fell into the bottom of nearby Rainbow 8 eyins "pAig eJjysiM €scg 'S|IH Áueneg 14 Canyon. Some grading of Rainbow Avenue and this land area, including the four subject lots,
the area when the landslide stopped. However, debris from the destroyed
16 homes and the disturbed soil beds and bedrock stretching from the top of the landslide mass 15 occurred to clean up

(where the four lots are located), downhill to (and beneath) Rainbow Avenue, and further
18 downhill into Rainbow Canyon Park have never been comprehensively mitigated to avoid 17

19 reactivation of the slide mass.

20 17. The toe of the slide mass lies in the bottom of Rainbow Canyon, where an

21 intermittent watercourse, Rainbow Canyon creek, erodes the toe during seasonal rains. Rainbow

22 Canyon is a public open space park whose resources are managed by the Santa Monica

23 Mountains Conservancy - a State of California agency.

24 18. With knowledge of the troubled geologic history and stability of the project site,
25 the 1979 Northeast Community Plan adopted by the City Council downplanned the subject four
26 lots from Low Residential, which is consistent with R1-1 zoning, to Minimum Residential which
27

7 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

is consistent with minimum lot sizes ranging from 9,000 square feet to 40,000 square feet,

2 greater street frontages, and lower housing density. In 1988-1990, when the City made its
3 zoning in the Northeast Community Plan area consistent with the General Plan Land Use

Designations, the subject lots were downzoned to RE-40, meaning that the lots must have

5 minimum street frontage and lot area in order to assure that this extremely sensitive geologic
land mass is not developed again with more dense and unsafe density of former R1-1 zoning on

7 the land.

8 19. In 2005, a prior developer, Jesus Reyes, owned these same lots. He filed
9 applications to develop four single-family homes on these same four lots (*2005 Project"). In

E0 this prior proceeding, the Director of Planning approved the 2005 Project. Upon appeal by the

11 Mount Washington Homeowners Alliance, the East Los Angeles Planning Commission granted ® Channel Law Group, d77 L1Z06 12 the appeal, overturned the use of a Categorical Exemption as the environmental review

S euns "pala eulysI!M €8€8 13 document, overturned the Planning Director's approvals of the four houses, and made factual
"SI!!H Beverly 14 findings. In their July 24, 2006 Letter of Determination for each lot, the East Los Angeles Area
15 Planning Commissioners found that substantial evidence existed in the record showing potential
16 significant impacts on Rainbow Canyon Park owned by the Santa Monica Mountains
17 Conservancy, impacts on the Carlin G. Smith Recreation Center used by the neighborhood's
18 children, traffic impacts on the winding, narrow street infrastructure, and the impact on land use

19 because the lots had been downplanned to Minimum Residential and downzoned from R1-1 to

20 RE-40 zoning to prevent R1-1 development intensity on the unmitigated land slide mass that
21 extends downhill into the open space parkland owned by the Santa Monica Mountains
22 Conservancy. It its decision, the Planning Commissioners observed that "Zoning is restricted to
23 minimum residential density and project as well as site does not meet minimum lot and yard
24 requirements. Subsequently, Jesus Reyes abandoned the 2005 Project.
25 20. In the years leading up to the four house applications filed for this Project, the
26 record shows that project plans were reviewed by the Grading Division of the City's Department
27

of Building and Safety. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that these

2 reviews included the Geology and Soils Report Approval Letter (March 16, 2015), all previous
3 reports for the site, LADBS Grading Division Correction Letters dated June 28, 2006, and July
4 21, 2014. The various geotechnical reports prepared for the 2005 Project version, as well as the

5 2016 Project version challenged herein, contemplated the massive remedial grading of all four of

6 the lots down to competent bedrock, sifting of the soil to remove uncertified fill (debris of
7 previously destroyed houses), movement of the soil back to the pads of the proposed four houses,

8 and the pounding of all this soil to compact it to certain standards. The 2016 Project also
contemplated the use of drilled caissons at various locations on the property lines of the four lots,
10 immediately adjacent to next-door property owners. The project did not propose any remedial
11 work to remediate the soil downhill beneath Rainbow Avenue to stabilize the roadway. Nor did
-1706 OgZ eUNS "pA8 eJjyS|!M E8€8 Channel Law Group, d77 12 it propose remedial work to stabilize/anchor the toe of the landslide mass in Rainbow Canyon
13
8 Park or on any of the lots down hill of Rainbow Avenue on the landslide mass.
SIl!H Beverly 14 21. On or about September 28, 2016, Real Party Abode Lumber Corporation, through
15 its Chief Executive Officer, Don Kain ("Abode"), filed four applications to develop a project
16| substantially similar to the 2005 Project: four single-family homes on four downplanned and
17 downzoned lots contrary to the general plan and applicable zoning as previously found by the
18 East Los Angele Planning Commission. On the application, Abode sought to construct the
19 project under four categorical exemptions without any environmental review. Although the

20 City's application requires disclosure of 500 feet proximity to a sensitive use such as a park or

21 recreation center, Abode on its application for ZA-2016-3715-ZAD-SPP (430 West Avenue 45)
22 failed to disclose the existence of the Carlin G. Smith Recreation Center and its outdoor trail,
23 playgrounds and basketball court across the street from the lot, and failed to disclose the
24 existence of the heavily wooded and brushy Rainbow Canyon Park approximately 150 feet away
25 from the lot. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that similar omissions
26 appear on the other three applications for the other houses in the 2016 Project applied for by
27

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Abode. Additionally, the City's application on page 3 of 8 required disclosure of previous cases
2 or environmental clearances for the project site. On the application for ZA-2016-3715-ZAD-

3 SPP (430 West Avenue 45), Abode affirmatively represented that there were no previous cases,

4 or environmental review. This representation was without factual basis as the 2005 Project case
5 numbers and environmental clearances were readily accessible to Abode online in the City's

6 Zoning Information and Management Access System ("ZIMAS"). Petitioner is informed and
7 believes, and thereon alleges that, as an experienced speculation real estate developer, Abode
8 would have known the prior geologic, land, zoning, and environmental review status of the
properties it purchased.

and 10 22. At the time of project application, the City requires an applicant to prepare

11 submit a radius map of all property owners within 500 feet of the outer boundaries of the Project. 8 d77 'dnois -IZ06 12 Based upon this radius map, the City also required submittal of Property Owners Mailing Labels

13 8 for property owners or tenants within 500 feet, and an Abutting Property Owners Mail Labels.
÷ euns "pAl8 elyS|IM €888 MET leuueyo 14 Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that the Mailing Labels prepared for the
Beverly 15 2016 Project application failed to include labels properly addressed to the Los Angeles
16 Department of Recreation, as owner and operator of the Carlin G. Smith Recreation Center, and
17 the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, as owner and operator of Rainbow Canyon Park.
18 23. Section 8(E)(2) of the Mount Washington/Glassell Park Specific Plan contains a
19| protection of the due process rights of nearby property owners. That section mandates that
20 within five days of filing of a Project application for a Permit Compliance Determination, the
21 applicant is required to post on the subject property a City-Planning-provided "Notice of Intent"
22 sign. The Notice of Intent sign provides the interested public with the planning case number and
23 notification that an application for development has been filed with the City. Pursuant to such
24 notice, members of the public can know that a development affecting their property and safety
25 interests has been filed, and can review the Project file, make copies, review the project proposal,
26 and begin a consultation process with experts, if necessary. Petitioner is informed and believes,
27

10 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 and thereon alleges, that Abode failed to comply with this due-process-noticing protection for
2 each of the four properties proposed on the four contiguous lots, and the City failed to enforce it
3 when it was not performed.

4 24. The Notice of Intent sign requirement of the Mount Washington/Glassell Park

5 Specific Plan is a substantive procedural right of nearby landowners and tenants, granted by the

6 laws of the City, to protect an affected person's "right to know" of the existence of a
7 development proposal likely to impact their property rights, health, and safety. The significance

8 of this "right to know" is heightened given the potential noise, ground vibration, and air quality
dust emissions from the remedial grading of this Project estimated to amount to approximately
10 17,000 cubic yards (according to Abode's own reports).

11 25. As a result of the failure to post the required Notice of Intent signs, no one in the IIYSI!M E888 0gZ ens "pAla d77 'dnois ME7 jeuueuo - LZ06 12 affected area of the proposed 2016 Project was aware of the pending application before the City
13 8 for at a minimum of one year and four months. Meanwhile, Abode and its consultants freely met
'S|IH Áuexeg 14 with City officials to discuss the Project proposal, and its environmental review, without anyone
15 affected by the Project knowing any review was underway.
16 26. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that the City knew of the
17 previous successful appeal of the 2005 Project, and the massive amounts of remedial grading
18 required for the proposed project, and accordingly took this past history into account in planning
19 the release date of the environmental review for CEQA purposes, and the extent of public notice
20 of the release inviting public comment.

21 27. On or about December 8, 2017, a proposed Mitigated Negative Declaration
22 ("MND") was filed in the City Clerk's office and the MND was allegedly made available on the

23 City's website on December 14, 2017. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges,
24 that the placement of the MND buried in multiple subpages of the City Planning Department's
25 website for public review and preparation of comments was timed to overlay the 2017 Christmas
26 and New Year's holidays, with comments of the public due not later than January 3, 2018, the

first business day after the holiday season.

2 28. The City's notice to the public of the availability of the MND for review and
3 public comment was a published notice in the Thursday print edition of the Los Angeles Times.
Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that this was the only notice provided to
the constitutionally affected property owners, as well as the general public.

29. The MND environmental notice for the Project does not appear on the Los
7 Angeles Times website where a significant portion of subscribers now access the content of the
8 Los Angeles Times, instead of the print version.

30. Although Abode was required at the time of filing its application to provide the
10 City Planning Department with mailing labels of Adjoining Property Owners and Property
11
8 Owners and Tenants within 500 feet of the Project boundaries, the City staff did not pick up a set
Channel Law Group, d77 "PAIE BUIJUSIIM E8€8 e}ng -1706 12 of mailing labels and use them to give actual mailed notice.

13
8 31. Although the City Planners know the email and mailing addresses of the Arroyo
'SIIH Áuerea 14 Seco Neighborhood Council, a City Charter-created entity for providing input into City decision
15 making processes, Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the record does

16 not establish that the City Planning staff mailed or emailed the MND notice to the Arroyo Seco
17 Neighborhood Council or any of its officers.

18 32. Although the City Planners know the email and mailing address of the Mount

19 Washington Homeowner Alliance ("MWHA"), the advocacy group in the affected area that
20 prevailed on the appeal of the 2005 Project, the City Planners did not send any copy of the MND
21 notice to the MWHA or its land use committee members who they had to know would have been

22 interested in participating in CEQA's formal review and comment process.

23 33. Even though Abode's radius map for owners within 500 feet depicts the City

24 parkland of the Carlin G. Smith Recreation Center directly across the street from the Project site,
25 the record does not show the City's Recreation Department was engaged at any time during
26 preparation of the MND, or at the time of circulation of the MND notice inviting comment.

34. Even though Abode's radius map of owners within 500 feet depicts nearly the
2 entire Rainbow Canyon Park to be within 500 feet of the boundaries of the Project, the record
3 does not show that the City Planners consulted with the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy
during preparation of the MND, or followed the requirements of CEQA to send to state agencies
5 like the Conservancy a copy of the MND and supporting appendices through the State

6 Clearinghouse to invite review and comment. Additionally, the record does not show that the
7 City Planners mailed or emailed a copy of a the MND or its appendices (including the geological
8 studies and all former approval letters) directly to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy.

9 35. On the City's Planning Department website, as of the time of the filing of this
10| lawsuit, the City only posted the 63-page MND which included only a tree report for each of the

CEQA-provided opportunity for review and public comment. The right of the public to review
7 officially published CEQA documents and to submit comments at the time provided by statute is
8 a substantive procedural right because the ability to submit comments during the official public
comment and consultation period increases the ability of affected property owners, state and

10 local agencies, and the interested public to effectively affect the City's decision making process

11 to change the Project in response to the comments. Petitioner is informed and believes, and 2 d11 'dnoJs ME] |euueyo 4LZ06 13 the deadline for public comment, evidences that the City circulated the MND notice with an 8 O}NS "PAIS BJIYSIM €888 12 thereon alleges, that the use of a form of notice and the timing of the release of that notice, and

15 process. The errors and omissions under this pattern and practice of the City frequently result in
16 no comments during the official CEQA comment period, and in fact did so here, because the
17 public and affected property owners received no actual, timely notice of the initiation of CEQA's
18 statutory public review and comment period, and were unaware that their substantial procedural

19 public participation rights were at risk of denial at the hands of the City's deficient noticing
20 practices.

21 39. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that in February 2018,
22 the City Planners used the mailing labels Abode submitted at the time of its September 2016
23 application to mail notice of a joint Zoning Administrator Hearing and Hearing Officer hearing
24 on the requested discretionary entitlements for the Project. The hearing was scheduled for
25 March 20, 2018. With this mailed notice, the affected property owners and tenants within the
26 area of the Project first learned of the proposed Project. The community had not more than

approximately 25 days to prepare for the public hearing, while the City, in failing to enforce the
2 Notice of Intent sign requirement of the Specific Plan, allowed the developer years to prepare for
3 the hearing.

40. On March 19, 2018, the City prepared a Mitigation Monitoring Program for the
5 MND that was based upon the receipt of no comments on the MND. Thus, the Project was
6 further solidified in the administrative process before the public had any meaningful input
7 opportunity. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges that the Mitigation
8 Monitoring Program was merely shared with Abode and placed in the file. Petitioner is informed
9 and believes, and thereon alleges, that it was not posted on the City website, and no notice of its
10 existence was given to anyone other than Abode.
11 In the days leading up to the March 20, 2018 hearing, community members
d77 Channel Law Group, -LZ06 12 eunS "palg eJlYS|!M €888 provided comments about the project and identified some of the glaring deficiencies described in 41. 8

13 this Petition. 8
42. Although usually a Zoning Administrator issues a determination within a month 'SIH Áuexeg 14

15 or so after a public hearing, that did not occur in this case. The record demonstrates that
16 significant issues had been raised at the public hearing. Six months after the public hearing,
17 Abode submitted an argument letter trying to rebut issues raised concerning the adequacy of the
18 MND. As for the allegations of failures of adequate notice, Abode offered no rebuttal at all. As
19 for allegations of complete failure to comply with procedural mandates of CEQA, Abode offered
20 no rebuttal. Abode also offered a new memo from Earth Systems explaining to the City all of
21 the various geologic reports and approval letters of the City, almost none of which were listed in
22 the MND for the public to review. The Earth Systems memo purported to summarize the
23 grading remediation process proposed in the technical studies. None of this explanation of the
remedial grading process was disclosed in the MND so that the public could understand the
25 magnitude of the grading, and the potential impacts of extended periods of noise, air emissions, 24

26 and greenhouse gas emissions from the Project. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon

series of "regulatory measures." Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that
2 this contention is not correct. The City's approval letter required compliance with a large a list of
3 protective measures, not all of which are required by law or regulation. The grading division's
4 identification of mitigation measures (those not already imposed by law or regulation) were
5 imposed by the City in its grading and soils report approval letters under the authority of CEQA.
6 None of these grading mitigation measures were disclosed to the public in the MND where they
7 were required to be exposed to public review and comment.

8 45. On August 2, 2019, the Zoning Administrator issued a Letter of Determination
adopting the MND for the project, and approved variance from LAMC § 12.21C.10(i)(3) and a

10 Project Permit Compliance approval under LAMC § 11.5.7C for each of four single-family

11 houses under the provisions of the Mount Washington/Glassell Park Specific Plan. In so doing,

17 objection letter regarding the City's failure to mail notice of the MND, or the MND and its 47.

21 parkland. . .. The Conservancy should have been afforded the opportunity to review the MND

22 and its supporting studies in order to recommend mitigation measures. The Conservancy
23 requests an opportunity to review and comment on a re-circulated environmental document to

24 ensure that adequate geological studies have been conducted and that the project design will not
25 result in adverse geological impacts to the resources of Rainbow Canyon Park."
26 48. On November 13, 2019, the East Los Angeles Planning Commission held a

1 hearing on the appeal. In its appeal materials, among other basic flaws already presented, the
2 MWHA pointed out that Abode's Project plans themselves established significant evidence that

3 up to three of the four houses violated the floor-area ratio limits of the Mount
4 Washington/Glassell Park Specific Plan and/or the Baseline Hillside Ordinance. The City
5 Planning Commission denied the appeal, sustained the determination to approve the Project, and

6 adopted the MND.

7 49. Upon issuance of the Planning Commission Letter of Determination, Petitioner
8 filed a timely appeal of the CEQA determination to the Los Angeles City Council pursuant to
Public Resources Code Section 21151(c). The City scheduled a public hearing for the appeal
10 before the Los Angeles City Council Planning and Land Use Management Committee (the

11
jeuueyo Law dnoJo d77 8383 Wilshire "pAI8 0gZ eUns 8 "PLUM") for February 25, 2020. On the Friday prior to this hearing date, the City Planners

15 that the public could have reviewed and commented on them. Calls upon the City to re-circulate
16 the MND were ignored.
17 50. After a continued hearing before the PLUM Committee on March 3, 2020, the
18 PLUM Committee voted to recommend to the City Council that the CEQA appeal be denied, and
19 that the Project be approved.
20 51. On March 17, 2020, the City Council, after commencement of the coronavirus

21 emergency, and without conducting any hearing at all, voted by consent to adopt the PLUM
22 Committee recommendation report marking final project approval.
23 52. Petitioner and others fully exhausted the matters that form the basis of challenge
24 of the Project.

25 53. On or about March 25, 2020, a Notice of Determination ("NOD") was filed with

CEQA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

5 54. The California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), found at Public Resources

6 Code Section 21000, et seq., is based on the principle that "the maintenance of a quality
7 environment for the people of this state now and in the future is a matter of statewide concern."
8 (Pub. Res. Code § 21000(a).)
9 55. In CEQA, the Legislature has established procedures designed to achieve these
10| goals, principally the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR"). These procedures provide both for
11
8 the determination and for full public disclosure of the potential adverse effects on the Channel Law Group, LLP -LZ06 12 environment of discretionary projects that governmental agencies propose to approve, and

8 euins "pAjg eulysI!M €8€8 13 require a description of feasible alternatives to such proposed projects and feasible mitigation
'SII!H Áueneg 14 measures to lessen their environmental harm. (Pub. Res. Code § 21002.)
15 56. CEQA is not merely a procedural statute; it imposes clear and substantive
16 responsibilities on agencies that propose to approve projects, requiring that public agencies not
17 approve projects that harm the environment unless and until all feasible mitigation measures are
18 employed to minimize that harm. (Pub. Res. Code §§ 21002, 21002.1(b).)
19 57. Failure either to comply with the substantive requirements of CEQA or to carry

20 out the full CEQA procedures SO that complete information as to a project's impacts is developed

21 and publicly disclosed constitutes a prejudicial abuse of discretion that requires invalidation of
22 the public agency action regardless of whether full compliance would have produced a different a
23 result. (Pub. Res. Code § 21005.)
24 58. CEQA authorizes and directs the State Office of Planning and Research to adopt
25 guidelines for the implementation of CEQA by public agencies. (Pub. Res. Code § 21083.)
26 These guidelines, which are found at title 14, California Code of Regulations, Section 15000, et
27

19 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 seq. ("Guidelines"), are binding on all state and local agencies, including Respondent City.

2 59. The Guidelines establish procedures for calculating the baseline environmental

3 conditions at a proposed project site, providing that "[a]n EIR must a include a description of the
physical environmental conditions in the vicinity of the project, as they exist at the time the

5 notice of preparation is published, or if no notice of preparation is published, at the time of the

6 environmental analysis is commenced. .. . (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15125(a).)
7 60. Agencies may not undertake actions that could have a significant adverse effect
8 on the environment, or limit the choice of alternatives or mitigation measures, before complying
9 with CEQA. (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15004(b)(2).)

10 61. The Guidelines require "all phases of project planning, implementation, and
11 operation" to be considered in the Initial Study for a project. (14 Cal. Code Regs. §
L1Z06
8 09Z ens "PAIE BJlYSI!M E888 d77 5dnoJg ME7 |auueuo 12 15063(a)(1).) CEQA defines a project as "the whole of an action, which has a potential for
13 resulting in either a direct physical change to the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable
SIl!H ÁueAeg 14 indirect physical change in the environment." (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15378(a).)
15 62. The Guidelines require that a project description containing the "precise location
16 and boundaries of the proposed project" be included in the environmental review. (14 Cal. Code
17

18 63. An EIR must be prepared "[i]f there is substantial evidence, in light of the whole § Regs. § 15124(a).)

19 record before the lead agency, that the project may have a significant effect on the environment. .
20 99 (Pub. Res. Code § 21080(d).) That is, an EIR must be prepared "if a lead agency is
21 presented with a fair argument that the project may have a significant effect on the environment .
even though it may also be presented with other substantial evidence that the project will not 22

23 have a significant effect." (14 Cal. Code Regs. § 15064(f)(1).)
24 64. Under specific and limited circumstances, the public agency evaluating a
25 proposed project may find that an EIR is not required. In such cases, the agency may adopt a
26 negative declaration or a mitigated negative declaration ("MND"). A negative declaration may
27

20 28

1 be prepared and adopted for a proposed project that "will not have a significant effect on the
2 environment and does not require the preparation of an environmental impact report." (Pub. Res.

3 Code § 21064.) An MND may be prepared or adopted when "revisions in the project plans

4 would avoid the effects or mitigate the effects to a point where clearly no significant effect on

5 the environment would occur" and "there is not substantial evidence in light of the whole record

7 environment." (Pub. Res. Code § 21064.5., emphasis added) If either of these conditions does 6 before the public agency that the project, as revised, may have a significant effect on the

17 adoption of the declaration. (Pub. Res. Code § 21081.6(c).)
18 67. Any violation of CEQA procedural requirements that deprives the public of the

19 ability to meaningfully participate is prejudicial and requires setting aside the environmental
20 document and project approvals until such time as the public agency complies with CEQA
21 substantive and procedural requirements.

6 history of the project site so as to permit the public the ability to meaningful participate in the

7 CEQA commenting and mitigation process, all in violation of CEQA.

8 70. The MND is fatally flawed and not even minimally compliant with CEQA. The
MND is internally inconsistent and confusing, characterizing many environmental effects that
10 will be caused by the Project as potentially significant, but allegedly insignificant "with

11 mitigation," without actually setting out and requiring the mitigation upon which those findings
-LZ06 OSZ HHNS "PAIE BIIUSIIM S8€8 d11 'dnoig Channel Law 12 are based. Many determinations in the MND are unsupported by any facts, or are premised on

Studies Supporting the MND Online)
5 74. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
6 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
7 75. The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy is a state agency with control over
8 natural resources in Rainbow Canyon Park that could be impacted by the Project, including
9 further collapse of the bottom of the landslide mass into the state parkland. The Conservancy is
10 a trustee agency as defined in CEQA Guidelines 15386.
11 76. The record shows that the City violated CEQA, including Guidelines §§ 15072 (a)
MET |OUUEuO 'dnoJs d77 L LZ06 12 and 15073(c), because it failed to circulate the notice of intent to adopt the MND and the MND

17 allow the public and agencies the review period provided under Section 15105." Having failed
18 to circulate the MND to trustee agency Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy through the State

19 Clearinghouse (or at all), the City has failed to proceed in accordance with law.
20 77. The City placed its MND in a file in City Hall, and on the City Planning
21 Department website. While the MND attached some tree reports for the four lots, it failed to
22 attach the most critical and public health and safety documentation: all of the soils and geology
23 reports and multiple City letters of approval imposing various project conditions related to the
24 landslide mass and its remediation. None of these project conditions were included as mitigation
25 measures in the published MND. While the City asserted that there would be no significant
26 impact as to placing the health and safety of persons at risk of landslide, the public was deprived

15 79. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in

16 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
17 80. The MND circulated by the City was facially deficient. Despite the City and
18 Abode's knowledge of the existence of the 1968-1969 landslide, the MND failed to describe the

19 current environment conditions of the steep bedrock bedding planes of the slide area that extends

20 from underneath the four subject lots at the top of the slide area, under Rainbow Avenue, across
21 adjacent lots also rendered "vacant" when homes on those lots slid into the canyon, and ending at
22 the toe of the landslide mass in the bottom of Rainbow Canyon Park owned by a state trustee
23 agency.
24 81. The MND also failed to disclose the prior 2005 Project of Jesus Reyes where the
25 East Los Angeles Planning Commission concluded the Project violated the General Plan Land
26 Use Designation of Minimum Residential and applicable RE-40 zoning. This prior effort to

develop the same land that ended in a binding Planning Commission decision was required as

2 minimum information relevant to whether the Project recycled by Abode remained a violation of
3 the General Plan and applicable zoning, and would trigger a negative land use impact because
4 the downplanning was identified in the EIR for the 1979 Northeast Community Plan as a CEQA
mitigation measure implemented by the City. Removal of or ignoring a previously adopted

6 mitigation measure incorporated to planning law is a negative land use impact under CEQA

7 because it would allow that which the lead agency previously said would be barred to reduce or

8 eliminate negative environmental impacts. Indeed, the geology and soils reports and City
approval letters relied upon by the City in concluding there would be no risk of injury or damage
10 from landslide on or off the project site was based in part on studies and approval letters for the

11 prior 2005 Project of Mr. Reyes. 8 Channel Law Group, LLP -LZ06 12 82. The MND also failed to disclose that the Project lies within a Very High Fire

8 ezns "pala eulys|!M €8€g 13 Hazard Severity Zone that places the area at the state's highest risk of death and injury due to
'SII!H Áueneg 14 wildfire. The MND, in reliance on this omission, undertook no analysis of the wildfire risk
15 adjacent to Rainbow Canyon Park, a densely wooded and brushy area, and how the four homes
16 could affect emergency vehicle access during construction if there was wildfire, and further
17 impose inappropriate densification of housing in such a high-risk area where the City Council

18 previously downplanned and downzoned troubled lots in hillside areas of Northeast Los Angeles.
19 83. The MND also failed to disclose the conflict of the density of the Project with the
20 General Plan Land Use Designation of Minimum Residential and RE-40 zoning. None of the
21 lots complied with the Northeast Community Plan Land Use Designation or the RE-40 zoning,
22 yet the MND asserted without any explanation that the general plan and zoning permits "One
23 unit per lot" without any analysis or justification. The 1979 Northeast Community Plan's EIR
24 adopted the downplanning to Minimum Residential as an adopted mitigation measure. In 1988-
25 1990, the City under its consent decree, imposed RE-40 zoning to force owners of contiguous
26 lots to combine them into less dense project sites. In the current 1998 Northeast Community

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 Plan, the City left undisturbed the prior downplanning and downzoning of these lots expressing
2 an intent to leave the 1979 Plan's mitigation measure in place on these lots. The MND discloses
3 none of this zoning history or how the City thinks that the General Plan or the RE-40 zoning
permit "One unit per lot." This statement in the MND appears to have been simply false. The
5 City's failure to alert the reviewing public of this area of conflict with the adopted general plan

6 land use designation and applicable zoning prejudicially deprived the public of its right to
understand the potential significant negative land use impact and to advocate ways to mitigate or

8 avoid it.

84. These are just a handful of the most glaring omissions from the project
10 description, analysis, and mitigation measures proposed by the City in the original MND. When

11
8 all of these deficiencies were raised in the administrative proceedings, along with a demand that
MET |BUueYO 'dnois d77 11Z06 12 the MND's obvious deficiencies be remedied by re-circulating a proper full disclosure document,

8 oInS "PALE BUlYSIIM €8€8 13 the City Planners, like they did in 2005, simply refused to do so.
'SI!!H Beverly 14 85. Even worse, the City allowed Abode and its consultants to propose two Notices of
15 Errata. The First Notice of Errata belatedly purposed changes to the project description, such a
16 providing a new, yet still deficient, disclosure of the 1968-1969 slide, as if that was a mere a
17 technical change, and not a fundamental information failure of the original MND circulated to
18 the public. For the City to claim that omission of any information about the devastating 1968-
19 1969 landslide was merely technical, and not a fundamental information omission, is to deny the

20 very purposes of CEQA to assure that they public has the same information as decision makers.
21 As a document of governmental accountability and reasoned decision making, the omission of

22 any information about the prior landslide was a gaping hole that could not be papered over by
23 Abode with a mere Notice of Errata.

24 86. Finally, just 13 days prior to the City Council's PLUM hearing, the City issued
25 the Second Notice of Errata. Attached thereto, the City dumped into the administrative record 86
26 pages of technical noise, air emissions, and greenhouse gas analysis for the Project. These were

1 not, as the City claimed, "supplements" to the studies and analysis in the original MND. They
were studies that were required to be circulated as part of the MND in the first place so that the

mitigation. By holding these significant technical studies until the final days before Project

5 approval after a more than three year administrative process, the City's actions completely
derailed the public participation rights of the public, and telegraphed an intent by City Planners
7 to deprive Petitioner and the public of their right to consult with technical experts and, if

8 necessary, prepare countervailing expert analysis and evidence.

87. For all of these reasons, the refusals of the City from March 2018 through March
10 2020, a two-year period, to simply correct the informational deficiencies of the MND by
11 recirculation of a proper document, was a failure to a proceed in accordance with law. 8 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION d77 'dnoJg ME7 jeuueuo -1Z06 eyns "PALE eJUSIIM £888 12

16 89. The Northeast Community Plan requires that a City decision maker make written
17 findings that the proposed project is consistent with the General Plan as expressed in the
18 Northeast Community Plan and the plan map showing land use designations. Land use
19 designations are directly linked to the planning process where over the life of a community plan,
20 the City estimates the amount of population that must be accommodated, and then density is
21 allocated over the plan area through the use of land use designations.
22 90. The Northeast Community Plan designates the subject lots as Minimum
23 Residential that is less dense designation than the former Low Residential designation on the
24 lot. At no time during the 1979 or 1998 Northeast Community Planning processes, or in the Plan
25 itself, did the City give notice that the zoning provision enacted in the 1960s might somehow be
26 later used to override the Minimum Residential land use designation assigned to these four lots.
27

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

Our Supreme Court has recently ruled that a city's general planning process must disclose such

2 significant information because the land use designation is the fundamental tool for allocating
3 the density of people and structures over the general plan area.
91. Despite this binding caselaw, the City in this case purported to apply an obsolete

7 consistent with the applicable (and supreme) Minimum Residential Land Use Designation.

8 92. None of the four lots individually or collective contain the minimum required
street frontage or the required minimum lot size of 40,000 square feet. These lots were

10 downplanned and downzoned in 1979 and 1988-1990, and no previous owner of these lots sued

1 94. The City's failure to make a finding of consistency with the lawfully imposed

was a failure to proceed in accordance with law.

FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION 6

7 (Violation of the Floor Area Limits of the Mount Washington/Glassell Park Specific
Plan or Baseline Hillside Ordinance) 8

95. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
10 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
11 96. The Mount Washington/Glassell Park Specific Plan imposes a floor area ratio 8 d77 Channel Law Group, •+Z06 12 ("FAR") limit in order to protect the sensitive, steep, fire prone hillside areas. Under the City
13
8 e}ns "palg eu!us|!M €888 laws and the Specific Plan, covered parking areas are within the definition of a building, and the
'SIlH uereg 14 square footage of garages and carports are included in the calculation of a buildings FAR
15 compliance.
16 97. Section 2 of the Specific Plan provides that the provisions of the Los Angeles
17 Municipal Code apply to a project, unless the Specific Plan on a particular project issue is
18 generally more restrictive. This is the case as to calculating the FAR limit.
19 98. Subsequent to the enactment of the Specific Plan, the City adopted the Baseline
20 Hillside Ordinance. It calculates the permitted FAR based upon the slope of the lot. The more
21 sloped the lot, the less FAR permitted.
22 99. In this case, although the two methods of calculating FAR are similar, the City
23 Planners refused to apply the Baseline Hillside Ordinance requirement of a submission of a
24 certified survey of topography in order to apply the calculation under this ordinance. Thus, the
25 record is devoid of substantial evidence that the City Planners calculated the FAR of each house
26 project under both the Specific Plan and the Baseline Hillside Ordinance to determine which is
27

29 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 the most restrictive. City Planners only applied the Specific Plan, but then in the case of some of
2 the four houses, refused to count the square footage of the garage or carport in the calculation.
3 100. In 2006, in another appeal of an unlawful project at 315 Mavis Drive, the East

4 Los Angeles Planning Commission overturned the City Planning Director's approval of a house
5 project in which the City Planners failed to include the carport's square footage in the FAR

6 calculation under the Specific Plan. Not only did the East Los Angeles Planning Commission
7 overturn the 315 Mavis Avenue Project approval, it directed the City Planning Department to
8 apply the interpretation that all covered parking whether within a garage or within the building
structure of a carport shall be included in the FAR calculation under the Specific Plan. A copy
10 of this prior Planning Commission decision was submitted to the City in this case.

11
Channel Law Group, d77 euluSI!M €8€8 Blvd., Suite 750 101. Despite this binding interpretation of carport FAR under the Specific Plan,
- +706 12 Abode's own conceptual project plans and square footage calculations establish that up to three
13
8 of the houses approved by the City exceed the FAR authorized by law. Despite detailed
'SIIH Aueneg 14 objections submitted by community members, the City ignored these objections and approved
15 house projects that violate the FAR limit of the Specific Plan.
16 102. Furthermore, because the City refused to require Abode to produce slope analysis
17 for each lot to calculate what the FAR limit would have been under the Baseline Hillside

18 Ordinance, the City has no evidence before it to properly apply Section 2 of the Specific Plan

19 that directs the City to use the most restrictive FAR calculation.

20 103. The City's failure to calculate the Baseline Hillside Ordinance FAR, and the

21 City's approval of multiple houses without including carport square footages in the FAR
22 calculation was a failure to proceed in accordance with law, and the approvals for such oversized
23 houses must be set aside until Abode fully complies with law.

SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION
2 (Violation of the Notice of Intent Sign Mandate of Section 8(E)(3) of the Mount
3 Washington/Glassell Park Specific Plan)
104. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
5 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
6 105. Section 8(E)(3) of the Mount Washington/ Glassell Park Specific Plan mandates
7 that the applicant for a Specific Plan Permit Compliance determination post a Notice of Intent
8 sign on the subject property within five days of the filing of the Project application. One of the
purposes of the Notice of Intent sign is to alert the surrounding property owners and interested
10 public that a Project application has been filed with the City. In response to this Notice on the

11
8 lot, persons interested in the environmental review can, under Pub. Res. Code Section
Channel Law Group, LLP 8383 Wilshire Blvd., Suite -IZ06 12 21092(b)(3) request placement on the mailing list for the environmental review.
13
8 106. Section 2 of the Specific Plan expressly states that the requirements of the
SIl!H Beverly 14 Specific Plan overrule the provisions of the Los Angeles Municipal Code if the Specific Plan
15 requirement is more restrictive. The Specific Plan's Section 8(E)(3) mandate to post a Notice of
16 Intent sign on the lot is more restrictive and affords greater rights of due process notice than
17| otherwise afforded by the municipal code. Accordingly, the City has a mandatory duty in this
18 case, as in every case filed under the Specific Plan, to require the applicant to post a Notice of
19 Intent sign within five days of the application, and to provide photographic proof of the sign
20 posting for the case file.
21 107. The City failed to do so in this case. The record is devoid of any evidence the
22 City required proof of posting within 5 days, or even substantial compliance, by requiring the
23 error to be corrected as soon as it came to the attention of the City Planner.
24 108. The City's failure to proceed in accordance with law in this case was highly
25 prejudicial to Petitioner's members and other individual property owners and tenants with
26 constitutionally protected interests concerning the impacts of the Project. Persons whose house
27

foundations lie within a few feet of where Abode proposes to excavate deep into the soil
2 supporting their homes or drill caissons deep into the bedrock, had a constitutional right of notice

3 of the City's circulation and invitation for comment on the MND. Had the City enforced the
Specific Plan's Section 8(E)(3) sign posting requirement, persons with such protected property,

5 health and safety interests could have sought to be added to the list of "interested persons" under

6 Pub. Res. Code § 21092.2(a), in an effort to assure they received a copy of the required mailed
7 notice of the release of an environmental document for public review and comment under Pub.
8 Res. Code §21092(b)(1) & (3). The City's failure to require posting of the Notice of Intent sign,
even if it was more than 5 days after the filing of the application, and for more than one year

10 between the September 28, 2016 date of the filing of the applications until the December 14,

11
LIZ06 OS BIAS VPANE RIUSIMA BOS 'SI!H Beverly 2017 release of the Notice of Intent to Adopt Proposed MND, prejudicially deprived Petitioner's
MEl jeuueyo Group, d77 12 members and other constitutionally protected landowners and tenants from protecting their
13 interests in getting on the interested persons list to receive and comment upon an environmental
14 document that should have disclosed and analyzed in detail how the foundations of their homes
15 would not be affected by Abode's massive excavation of at least 17,000 cubic yards of a former
16 slope failure next to their homes.
17 109. And furthermore, the failure of the City to enforce the Section 8(E)(3) Notice of
18 Intent sign requirement foreclosed significant amounts of time constitutionally affected persons
19 could themselves investigate the Project files at City Hall, gather documents about the prior
20 events surrounding the landslide, consult with experts to advise them regarding their property
21 rights, request a meeting with the City Planners or their elected City officials, or other efforts to
22 protect their constitutionally protected interests in conduct of an appropriately sized and safe
23 I project a few feet away from their own homes. None of that was permitted when the City failed

24 to comply with its legal duty to enforce Abode's obligation under Section 8(E)(3) to give posted
25 notice of the Project to the surrounding community through the simple act of posting a Notice of
26 Intent to a seek a permit under the Mount Washington/Glassell Park Specific Plan.
27

28 32

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

1 110. The facts in the record on this point alone raise the disturbing possibility that the
2 failure to enforce Section 8(E)(3) was intentional on the part of the City Planners assigned to the
3 case.

111. On this basis alone, the prejudicial failure to afford the basic notice of the filing of
5 the project application was a failure to proceed in accordance with an important notice law

6 particularly intended to protect due process rights of affected persons within the Specific Plan
7 area.

8 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

(Violation of the California and U.S. Constitutions As To Failure To Give Notice

10 Reasonably Calculated To Give Actual Notice Of The Release Of The MND For

8 Channel Law Group, d77 LLZ06 12 112. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
13 8 euNS "pALE BJLySIIM €8E8 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
SIlH Áueneg 14 113. The detailed factual statement presented herein documents how the City failed to
15 enforce the Specific Plan's Notice of Intent sign posting requirement, and refused to invite
16 constitutionally protected landowners and tenants from actual mailed or emailed notice. The
17 City's only notice on that issue was the publication once in the Los Angeles Times.
18 114. The City's decision to follow only Pub. Res. Code § 21092(b)(3)(A) is not
19 sufficient as a matter of law to protect the due process interests of landowners and tenants
20 immediately adjacent to a real estate development project that may adversely impact their
21 property, health, safcty and similar interests. Such persons with constitutionally protected
22 interests fall within the protections of the due process clause of the California and U.S.
23 Constitutions.

24 115. This constitutional issue was raised in objection letters:
25 "Of course, the City will claim that published notice in tiny print once in the Los Angeles
26 Times is sufficient because Pub. Res. Code Section 21092 alone does not require more.

7 118. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in

8 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
119. An actual and present controversy has arisen and now exists between Petitioner
10 and its members, on the one hand, and the City, on the other, in that the City has demonstrated a
11 pattern and practice that constitutes an overarching, quasi-legislative policy of City officials to 0948 12 (1) fail to use a method of notice of the initiation of CEQA's public review and comment period

19| declaration, along with every technical study the City relied upon in making its conclusions
20 about potential significant environmental impacts of projects, and the proper type of

21 environmental review.

22 120. Petitioner in this litigation was prejudicially denied CEQA's right of timely notice
process on the MND, and unless its rights are 23 of the initiation of the CEQA review and comment
24 declared, the City will persist in its pattern and practice of using only published notice as its only
25  notice to persons with constitutionally protected rights to timely and actual notice of the
26 commencement of CEQA's review and comment process.

35 28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE AND COMPLAINT

121. Petitioner and all reviewing public agencies and members of the public,

4 at a public place including the City's website. Guidelines § 15150(b) requires: "Where part of

5 another document is incorporated by reference, such other document shall be made available for

6 public inspection at public place or public building." The City's website is a "public place"
7 where the potential CEQA commenters are routinely invited to review an EIR, mitigated
8 negative declaration, or negative declaration. Particularly during this time of health crisis, no
member of the public should be required to risk infection from COVID-19 to assess, copy, and
10 review a full environmental document and supporting technical reports at only City Hall.

15 such impacts.

20 124. Petitioner has no plain, speedy or adequate remedy available to it in the

To Whom It May Concern:
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under California Public Resources Code section 21167.5, that Petitioner, Rainbow Safety Group, intends to immediately file a Petition for Writ of Mandate (*Petition") under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), inter alia, against the City of Los Angeles ("City"). The Petition will be filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court and will allege, inter alia, that the City did not comply with the California Environmental
Quality Act when it approved a four-home development project on Rainbow Avenue and Avenue 45
("Project"). Namely, the City improperly concluded that the Project would not have a significant effect on the environment and adopted Mitigated Negative Declaration. Further, the Petition will allege that the City abused its discretion when it approved the Project because the Project does not conform to all applicable zoning and municipal code regulations. A copy of the Notice of
Determination filed by the City of Los Angeles for the Project is attached hereto as Exhibit A.
