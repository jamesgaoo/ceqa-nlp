24 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

25 1. Venue is proper in this Court because the real property and proposed development in
26 question is located in San Diego, California.

27 2. Petitioners/Plaintiffs Andrew Midler and Monica Midler are individuals who at all
28 times alleged herein resided at the real property located at 6350 Camino De La Costa, La Jolla,

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/ INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

¡:

California 92037 (the "Midler Property'). Petitioner/Plaintiff Moses Property, LLC ("Moses") is, and

2 at all times herein mentioned was, a limited liability company organized and existing under the laws

3 of the State of California, with its principal place of business in San Diego, California. Moses is the

4 record owner of the Midler Property. Andrew Midler, Monica Midler and Moses shall hereinafter

5 collectively be referred to as the "Midlers" or "Petitioners."

6 3. Respondent/Defendant City of San Diego ("City") is and at all times herein mentioned

7 was a municipal corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of California, located

8 in the County of San Diego, State of California, and is the entity which grants final approval for

9 projects and ensures California Environmental Quality Act compliance before approving projects.

10 4. Real Parties in Interest Roger B. Abbott and Rosalind M. Abbott are, and at all times

11 mentioned in this complaint were, residents of San Diego County, California. Roger B. Abbott and

12 Rosalind M. Abbott as Co-Trustees of the Abbott Family Trust are record owners of the real property

13 located at 6340 Camino De La Costa, La Jolla, California 92037 (the "Abbott Property"). Roger B.

14 Abbott and Rosalind M. Abbott shall hereinafter collectively be referred to both individually and in
15 their capacity as Co-Trustees as the "Abbotts".

16 5. The Midlers do not know the true names and capacities of the Respondents/Defendants

17 sued 1 as DOES 1 through 40, inclusive, and therefore sues them by fictitious names. The Midlers
18 allege that Respondents/Defendants DOES 1 through 40, inclusive, are jointly, severally and/or
19 concurrently liable and responsible for the causes of action set forth herein, acting on their own or as
20 the agents of named Respondents/Defendants. The Midlers will request leave to insert the true names

21 of the fictitiously named Respondents/Defendants when the information has been ascertained.

22 6. In late 2017, the Abbotts proposed a rehabilitation and remodel of the Abbott Property
23 which proposed to construct a 214 square foot addition to the main level and a 3,488 square foot
24 addition to the second story of the existing single family residence on the Abbott Property. The

25 Abbotts further proposed remodeling their existing northern garage to include a 359 square foot office

26 in addition to adding 309 square feet to the existing southern garage. In total, the proposed
27 development on the Abbott Property identified as Coastal Development Permit/Site Development
28 Permit 538814 ("CDP/SDP 538814") would constitute 4,370 square feet of new development for a

2
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE: COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/ INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

total of 11,731 square feet of development (collectively, the "Project").

2 7. On or about September 18, 2017, Les Reed (Reed"), an experienced geotechnical
3 engineer with Geotechnical Exploration, Inc. filed with the La Jolla Development Permit Review
Committee a letter identifying bluff stability issues associated with the Project and the proposed

5 CDP/SDP 538814.

6 8. On or about September 19, 2017, the Midlers, through counsel, filed with the La Jolla

7 Development Permit Review Committee a letter identifying certain issues with the Project and the

•8 proposed CDP/SDP 538814. Specifically, the letter identified issues with: (a) geotechnical and bluff

9 stability and recession issues concerning the sensitive coastal bluff the Project is situated on, (b)
10 general inconsistency with the community and neighborhood character, and (c) the Project's

11 compliance with the City's Previously Conforming Use Requirements.

12 9. On or about November 8, 2017, the Midlers filed with the City Code Enforcement

13 Request for violations of: (a) Coastal Development Permit 41-0068, which required that all fences and
14 retaining walls shall comply with San Diego Municipal Code Section 142.0301, (b) San Diego
15 Municipal Code Section 126.0704(a)(4), which required a coastal development permit prior to the

16 Abbotts' removal of vegetation throughout the coastal bluff area including their removal of a mature

17 palm tree situated on the boundary between the Abbott Property and the Midler Property, and (c) San
18 Diego Municipal Code Section 132.0403 regarding preservation of existing or potential public views.

19 10. Within the 60-day window in which response to the Code Enforcement Request was
20 due, staff at the City contacted the Midlers' counsel via telephone to inform the Midlers that their

21 request for inspection of the violations of Coastal Development Permit 41-0068 and the San Diego
22| Municipal Code would be evaluated and resolved as part of CDP/SDP 538814.

23 11. On or about March 30, 2018, the Midlers, through counsel, filed with the City a letter

24 identifying issues with the Project, including: (a) failure to map a visible sea cave that appeared to be
25 expanding on the sensitive coastal bluff, (b) failure to account for the status of the existing retaining

26 wall on the property as a protective device requiring a full 40-foot bluff top setback, and (c) failure to
27 account for new development in relying on previously conforming uses on the Abbott Property.

28 12. On or about August 17, 2018, the Midlers, through counsel, filed with the City a letter

3
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/ INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1| putting the City on notice that staff had forwarded the Code Enforcement Request to the City's

2 Development Services department for review as part of CDP/SDP 538814. While some conditions

3 had been addressed, the letter made clear that the unpermitted removal of a mature palm tree and other

4 vegetation from the sensitive coastal bluff had never been addressed or referenced in any review cycle

5 comments, and needed to be reviewed as part of the overall permit and environmental review process.

6 13. On or about August 28, 2018, Reed filed with the City a letter updating his analysis on
7 bluff stability issues associated with the Project and the proposed CDP/SDP 538814 in light of
8 comments received from the City and from the Coastal Commission, concluding that there were still

9 potential impacts associated with Project's proposed development.

10 14. On or about November 30, 2018, the City distributed for 30 day public review Negative

11 Declaration No. 538814 (the "Negative Declaration"), concluding that the Project would not have a
12 significant impact on the environment.

13 15. On or about December 19, 2018, within the 30 day public review window for the
14 Negative Declaration, the Midlers, through counsel, filed with the City a letter identifying impacts a

15 from the Project on the environment requiring environmental review above and beyond the Negative
16 Declaration, including: (a) critical expert commentary from geotechnical engineer Les Reed sufficient

17 to invalidate the negative declaration, (b) failure to address soil strength, safety, subsidence, managed
18 retreat, and the nature (as a "bluff protection device") and role of the seawall, (c) failure to address the

19 removal of the mature palm tree and other vegetation from the sensitive coastal bluff, and (d) failure
20 to protect the City's view requirements through an express easement.

21 16. On or about August 5, 2019, Reed filed with the City an additional letter updating his

22 analysis on bluff stability issues associated with the Project and the proposed CDP/SDP 538814 in

23 light of the City's analysis associated with sea level rise and potential impacts of the Project,

24 concluding that there were still potential impacts associated with Project's proposed development.

25 17. On or about August 7, 2019, the Project was before the City's Hearing Officer. Counsel
26 for the Midlers presented the summary of their arguments as to the Project's impacts on the

27 environment and the failures of CDP/SDP 538814 to account for development impacts to the Hearing

28 Officer. The City's Hearing Officer nevertheless approved the Project and adopted the Negative

4
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/ INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Declaration.

2 18. On or about August 16, 2019, the Midlers, though counsel, appealed the City Hearing

3 Officer's approval of CDP/SDP 538814 to the Planning Commission on the basis that: (a) the Hearing

4 Officer erred in concluding that the Code Enforcement issues had been addressed separately rather
than incorporated into the new coastal development permit process, and the Project requires separate
6 mitigation and restoration efforts prior to any approval, (b) the proposed 25 foot setback was

7 unsupported by previously conforming uses in light of potential environmental harm, and (c) no

8 easement language existed to ensure opaque items like trash barrels did not obstruct the view corridor

9 required under the San Diego Municipal Code.

10 19. On or about August 16, 2019, the Midlers, though counsel, appealed the City Hearing

11 Officer's approval of the Negative Declaration to the City Council on that basis that: (a) the Hearing

12 Officer failed to evaluate the evidence proffered by a geotechnical engineering expert that the project

13 could cause environmental harm, (b) the proposed 25 foot setback was unsupported by previously

14 conforming uses in light of potential environmental harm, and (c) the findings on the seawall

15 constituted factual error in assuming that the historical conditions concerning the protective device

16 will continue to be the conditions moving forward in light of sea level rise and climate change.

17 20. On or about November 15, 2019, the Midlers, through counsel, circulated a letter to the

18 City Clerk and City Councilmembers laying out the legal and factual basis for the appeal of the

19 Negative Declaration.

20 21. The City made a final decision approving the Negative Declaration for the Project on

21 November 18, 2019 via a unanimous vote of the City Council.

22 22. The Midlers fully exhausted any and all administrative remedies available to them
23 related to the appeal of the Negative Declaration by the above correspondence and by their

24 presentation before the City Council.

25 23. Under the City's procedures, the Midlers' appeal of CDP/SDP 538814 is still pending
26 before the Planning Commission. Petitioners will request leave to amend and supplement this pleading

27 once the adjudication of its administrative rights and remedies relating to CDP/SDP 538814 concludes.

28 24. The Midlers have complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code Section

5
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE: COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/ INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

i:

1 21167.5 by mailing a written notice of commencement of this action to the City. A true and correct

2 copy of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.

3 25. The Midlers have requested that the City prepare the record of proceedings relevant to

4 approval of the Project, pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21167.6. A true and correct copy

5 of that notice is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.

6 26. The Midlers have complied with Public Resources Code Section 21167.7 by filing a
7 copy of the original petition with the California Attorney General. A true and correct copy of the

8 notification is attached hereto as Exhibit 3.

9 27. If successful, this action will result in the enforcement of important rights affecting the
10 public interest in that:

11 a. This action involves significant statutory and constitutional rights of the public

12 to sensitive coastal areas, the public beach directly below the Project, and the sea cave underneath he

13 Project, all of which are not appropriately accounted for by the Negative Declaration;

14 b. Petitioners' success in this action will confer a significant benefit on a large

15 class of persons in that preservation of the sensitive coastal bluff and the beach directly below the
16 Abbott Property and the Project will be protected and preserved;

17 C. The necessity and financial burden of private enforcement make an award of
18 attorney's fees appropriate because barring the filing of this action, the Project will proceed and the

19 impacts on the sensitive coastal bluff, the beach below the Abbott Property, and the public uses of that

20 beach will all be at risk of impact from the Project; and

21 d. Such fees should not, in the interest of justice, be paid out of the recovery
22 because Petitioners are acting to preserve a public good, public access to a the beach below, and the

23 overall safety of the public from debris or damage to the adjoining coastal bluff.

24 28. Respondent acted arbitrarily and capriciously in taking the actions described below,

25 pursuant to Government Code §800.

26 29. Petitioners have necessarily retained the law firm of Hecht Solberg Robinson Goldberg

27 & Bagley LLP to represent them in this action, and have incurred and will continue to incur reasonable

28 attorney's fees herein which they are obligated to pay.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

W (Petition for Writ Of Mandate: C.C.P. §1094.5 and/or §1085)
(California Environmental Quality Act)
(Against Respondent and Real Parties in Interest)

30.

6 Petitioners incorporate by this reference the allegations of paragraphs 1 through 1 29,
inclusive, as though fully set forth herein.

7 31.

8 Petitioners and others presented substantial evidence to support a fair argument that the

9 Project may have a significant effect on the environment in the following ways, among others:

a. Expert geotechnical opinion that the Project risked the overall stability of the
10 sensitive coastal bluff on which the Abbott Property is situated.

11 b. Evidence that the Project fails to address soil strength, safety, subsidence,
12 managed retreat, and the nature (as a "bluff protection device") and role of the seawall.

13 C. Evidence that the City failed to address, through mitigation or otherwise, the
14 Abbotts' removal of a mature palm tree and other vegetation from a sensitive coastal bluff.

15 d. Evidence that the City erred in justifying its standard of environmental review
16 by relying on the setbacks established in the Municipal Code, while approving a Negative Declaration
17 of the Project with reduced setbacks from the sensitive coastal bluff.

18 32. Respondent prejudicially abused its discretion under CEQA by failing to proceed in the
19 manner required by law, by coming to a decision not supported by the findings, and by relying on
20 findings not supported by the evidence, in the following ways, among others:

21 a,

22 Respondent failed to give appropriate deference to the expert opinion offered

23 by Reed in ratifying the Negative Declaration instead of requiring an Environmental Impact Report.
b.

24 Respondent failed to provide evidence supporting its findings that the Project
would have no impact on soil strength, safety, subsidence, managed retreat and the nature and role of
25 the seawall.

26 C.

27 Respondent determined that the Code Enforcement issues with the Project,

28 specifically the unpermitted destruction of a mature palm tree and other vegetation, had been addressed
separately when they in fact were rolled into the broader review of the Project.

7
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY/ INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

d. a Respondent came to a decision not supported by the findings by relying on its

2 setbacks to justify the Negative Declaration when in fact the Project relies on reduced setbacks from

3 the standard required a for a sensitive coastal bluff.

4 e. Respondent failed to address sea level rise and climate change as factors in its

5 determination that additional development would pose no environmental impact - reliance on previous

6 benchmark environmental standards is inadequate in light of changing environmental conditions.

7 33. Petitioners will suffer irreparable harm if the Project is allowed to continue because the

8 Abbott Property and the Midler Property are both situated on the same sensitive coastal bluff and

9 overlook the same beach below. The Project, if allowed to continue without proper environmental

10 review and approval prior to construction, is likely to cause irrevocable damage to the underlying

11 foundation of the Midler Property, the sensitive coastal bluff as a whole, and the neighboring beach

12 below the Project.

13 WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray as follows:

14 34. For peremptory writ of mandate commanding Respondent to (i) void the decision
15 approving Negative Declaration No. 538814; and (ii) suspend all activity that could result in any
16 change or alteration to the physical environment until and unless they take such actions as are

17 necessary to comply with CEQA;

18 35. For a preliminary injunction prohibiting the development and operation of the Project,

19 or any further work on or review of the Project, pending resolution of this action; and

20 36. For a permanent injunction prohibiting the development and operation of the Project,

21 or any further work on or review of the Project, until and unless Real Party and Respondents take such

22 actions as are necessary to comply with the laws governing the issuance of all approvals associated
23 with the Project; and

24 37. For costs of suit incurred herein; and

25 38. For reasonable attorney's fees incurred in prosecuting this action; and

26///

3 approve CDP/SDP 538814 .
