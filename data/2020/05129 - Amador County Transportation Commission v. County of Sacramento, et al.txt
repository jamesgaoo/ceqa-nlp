[PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE SECTION 21167.6.5]

TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE:

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5, that on
3 November 5, 2020, Petitioner and Plaintiff Amador County Transportation Commission filed the

4 attached petition for writ of mandate against the County of Sacramento, the Board of Supervisors
5 of the County of Sacramento, and the State of California, California Department of Transportation
6 aka Caltrans, (collectively, "Respondents") in the Sacramento County Superior Court. The petition
7 alleges that Respondents violated the California Environmental Quality Act, codified at Public
8 Resources Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"). The petition further alleges that by certifying a

9 legally-inadequate Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") that failed to comply with CEQA's
10 substantive and procedural mandates, the approval of the NewBridge Specific Plan project (the
11 | "Project") should also be overturned because it is based on the defective EIR. The Project will
12 facilitate the development of nearly 1,100 acres in unincorporated, predominantly-undeveloped
13 County area, into a mixed-use development including residential, commercial, recreational, and
14  other uses. A copy of the petition is attached to this notice as Attachment 1.

15 You are receiving this Notice because Respondent County of Sacramento identified your
16 agency as a CEQA "responsible agency" that has jurisdiction over a natural resource affected by
17 the NewBridge Specific Plan project that is the subject of this challenge. Your agency has not
18 been named in the action. A copy of the November 20, 2020, correspondence of the County of :
19 Sacramento containing the list of responsible agencies is attached to this notice as Attachment 2.

24 INTRODUCTION

25 1. Petitioner and Plaintiff Amador County Transportation Commission ("Petitioner"
26 or "ACTC") brings this Petition for WFit of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive
27 Relief ("Petition") against Respondents and Defendants the County of Sacramento ("County"), the
28 Board of Supervisors of the County of Sacramento ("Board"), the California Department of
2007326.8 14465-004
7 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

I Transportation ("Caltrans"), and Does 1 through 50, inclusive (collectively, "Respondents") to
2 compel Respondents to rescind their certification of the NewBridge environmental impact report
("EIR") and related approvals ("Project approvals") for failure to follow the mandates of the
California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code sections 21000 et seq. ("CEQA")
and the CEQA Guidelines, California Code of Regulations, Title 14, sections 15000 et seq.
("CEQA Guidelines").

2. The Petition relates to Respondent Board's October 6, 2020 approval of the
NewBridge Specific Plan, which will facilitate the development of nearly 1,100 acres in
9 unincorporated, predominantly undeveloped County area into a mixed-use development including
10 residential, commercial, recreational, and other uses ("Project"), and certification of the Project
11 EIR.

12 3, The NewBridge Specific Plan is a "project" under CEQA. CEQA requires that A
13 publio agency undertaking project with the potential to impact the environment must prepare an
14 EIR that uncovers, aualyzes, and adopts all feasible measures to mitigate those effects.

15 4. In approving the Project, Respondents prepared, relied on, and certified an EIR that
16 falls well below CEQA's minimum standards. Construction and operation of the Project would
17 generate significant environmental impacts that are not adequately analyzed in the'EIR and will
18| not be adequately mitigated by Project obligations and thus in violation of CEQA. Rospondents
19 failed to fully evaluate and disclose the reasonably foresecable environmental effects of the
20 Project, failed to support their findings with substantial evidence, failed to recirculate the EIR in
21 light of significant new information, and otherwise failed to comply with CEQA in preparation

22 and certification of the EIR, as alleged below.

23 5. In response to Petitioner's and other community members' multiple comment letters

24 and comments lodged during public hearings regarding the issues identified below, all part of the
25 administrative record in this matter, Respondents cite to the length of the planning process, EIR•
26 page count, and 20 plus appendices to support they have met the mandates of CEQA. However,
27 these factors are not dispositive of the EIR's legal sufficiency.

28
2007326.8 14465-004 2
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE: COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

6. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the Project will result
2 in significant and adverse impacts to transportation, greenhouse gas emissions, access to
emergency services, air quality, and create new safety risks associated with each. As such, the
4 Project will create significant environmental impacts.

5 7. Given the violations of CEQA, described in greater detail below, Respondents'
6 approval of the Project and certification of the EIR were done in violation of CEQA. (See Pub.
Resources Code, $8 21168 and 21168.5 and Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5.) For these reasons,
8 Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate commanding

9 Respondente to rescind, set aside, and void any arid all resplutions or documents related to the
10. Project approval and certification of the EIR, as well as any other legislative, quasi-adjudicatory,

11 or other discretionary or ministerial approvals of the Project or any portion thereof, and grant
12 Petitioners injunctive relief unless and until Respondents comply with CEQA's mandates.

13 PARTIES

14 8. Petitioner Amador County Transportation Commission is, and at all times relevant
15 herein, a State-designated regional transportation planning agency, formed pursuant to
16 Govemment Code sections 14522, et seq., and the local transportation commission to the County
17 of Amador. Petitioner's service area is all of Amador County, which neighbors Sacramento County

18 to the west, connected by State Route 16/Jackson Highway ("State Route 16"). Petitioner's mission
19 includes the protection and advancement of local, regional, and intrastate travel for the benefit of
20 Amador County residents, workers, business people, and visitors.

21 9; Respondent County of Sacramento is, and at all times relevant herein was, a
22 political subdivision of the State of Califomnia, and is a "local agency" as defined in section 54951
23 of the Government Code. The County also functions as a lead agency under CEQA. In this
24 capacity, the County is charged with evaluating the potential environmental impacts of the Project,
25 identifying Project alternatives and mitigation measures, and otherwise complying with the
26 substantive and procedural requirements of CEQA. Respondent Board of Supervisors of the
27 County of Sacramento is, and at all times releyant herein was, the decision-making body for
28 Respondent County,
2007326.8 14465-004 3
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE: COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 10. Respondent Caltrans is an executive department of the State of California,
2 headquartered in Sacramento, California, and manages the State's highway system; Caltrans is the
3 owner-operator of State Route 16, State Route 16 forms the southern border of the Project and any

4 development activity on or near the highway requixes Caltrans' discretionary approval. Approvals
5 from Caltrans required by the Project will inolude, but not be limited to, easement rights and
6 development permits on and around State Route 16. Caitrans is therefore a "responsible'agency"
7 for the Project under CEQA and required to comply with CEQA's substantive and procedural
8 requirements prior to approving the Project, or any portion thereof. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15381.)
11. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities, whether individual,
10 corporate; assoclate or otherwise, of Respondents Does 1 through 50, inclusive, and therefore sue
11 said Respondents under fiotitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition to reflect their true
12 names and capacities at such time that they become known.

13 12. Real Party in Interest East Sacramento Ranch, LLC is listed as the applicant for the
14 Project on filings with the State Clearinghouse and represented itself as the Project applicant
15 during public hearings and through communications during the pendency of the Project.
16 13. Petitioner is currently unaware of the true names or capacities, whether individual,
17 corporate, associate or otherwise, of Real Parties in Interest Roes 1 through 50, inclusive, and
18 therefore sue said Real Parties in Interest under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this
19 Petition to reflect their true names and capacities at such time that they become known.
20 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

21 14. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged herein pursuant to Code of
22 Civil Procedure sections 394, 395, 401, 1085, 1087, and 1094.5 and Public Resources Code
23 sections 21168 and 21168.5.

24 15. Venue is proper in Sacramento County pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
25 394(a) as Respondent County is within Sacramento County and pursuant to section 395 as
26 Respondent Caltrans is headquartered and operates in Sacramento County.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

STANDING AND EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

2 16. Petitioner has standing in this action where Petitioner seeks the enforcement of a

3 public duty by Respondents County and Board. Respondents County and Board are public entities
4 with a mandatory duty to comply with CEQA and all other applicable laws when approving the
5 Project. Petitioner alleges that Respondents County and Board failed to satisfy this duty by
6 certifying a legally-inadequate EIR that, as explained in more detail below, lacks requisite analysis
and mitigation when approving the Project in reliance on that EIR and is unsupported by
8 substantial evidence in the record.

9 17. Petitioner has standing in this action where Petitioner seeks the enforcement of a
10 publie duty by Respondent Caltrans. Respondent Caltrans is a public entity with a mandatory duty

11 to comply with CEQA and all other applicable laws. As described in further detail below,
12 Respondent Caltrans is a responsible agency to the Project and, in that role, has a duty to meet
13 certain procedural and substantive requirements of CEQA prior to approval of the Project.
14 Petitioner alleges that Respondent Caltrans failed to satisfy this duty by not complying with
15 CEQA's requirements prior to Respondent County and Board's certification of a legally-inadequate

16 EIR,

17 18. Petitioner has a direct and substantial beneficial interest in Respondents'
18 complianice with their statutory duties under CEQA because Petitioner is the regional
19 transportation planning agency to Amador County, which adjoins Sacramento County via State
20 Route 16, which will be significantly impacted by the Project as approved.

21 19. Petitioner took advantage of numerous opportunities where Petitioner knew
22 Respondents may be present to bring these issues to the attention of Respondents prior to approval
23 of the Project. Petitioner's counsel submitted comment letters each to Respondent County and
24 Respondent Caltrans. Petitioner's counsel also spoke on behalf of Petitioner at Respondent Board's
25 meetings discussing the Project and EIR on September 1, 2020 and October 6, 2020.

26 20. CEQA further allows a petitioner who objected to a project to allege in a writ
27 petition all deficiencies asserted by others. (Citizens for Clean Energy v. City of Woodland (2014)
28 225 Cal.App.4th 173, 191.) Petitioner, other agencies, interested groups, and individuals submitted
2007326.8 14465-004 5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 oral and written comments on the EIR and Project to Respondents, and raised each of the legal
2 deficiencies asserted in this Petition.

3 21. Respondents approved the project and certified the Project EIR on October 6, 2020.

4 This is final agency action.
22. Petitioner performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition, including
6 serving notice upon Respondents indicating its intent to commence this action, and fully exhausted
7 any available administrative remedies. In addition to claims raised by Petitioner, various other
8 parties have raised concerns regarding impacts of the Project. Petitioner incorporates ench of these
9 claims, objections, and comments herein. Petitioner does not have a plain, speedy, or adequate
10 remedy in the ordinary course of law. Petitioner authorized its attomey to file this lawsuit on its
11  behalf to assert its substantial beneficial interest in securing Respondents' compliance with the
12 law,

13 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

14 23. On October 6, 2020, Respondent Board voted to certify the EIR and approve the
15 Project. On October 7, 2020, or soon thereafter, Respondent County posted a Notice of
16 Determination for the certification of the BIR and approval of the Project.

17. 24. The statute of limitations for a CEQA challenge to Respondents' decision to certify
18 the BIR expires 30 days from the filing and posting of the Notice of Determination. (CEQA

19 Guidelinés, 69 15094(g) and 15112(c)(1).) This Petition is timely filed within the statute of
20 limitations.

21 NOTICE OF CEQA ACTION

22 25, On October 28, 2020, Petitioner sent a Notice of Commencement of Action
23 | pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5 via U.S. mail and electronic mail to
24 Respondents thereby notifying Respondents of Petitioner's intent to file this lawsuit, which seeks
25 to set aside Respondents' approval of the Project and certification of the Project EIR. A copy of
26 the Notice of Commencement of Action is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

27 26. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
28 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by mailing a copy of the Petition to the State

20D7326.8 14465-004 6
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Attorney General. A true and correct copy of the Service of Pleadings on the Attorney General is
2 attached hereto as Exhibit B and incorporated herein by reference.

3 PREPARATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

27. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6(a), Petitioner requests that
5 Respondent County prepare the record of administrative proceedings related to this action. A copy

6 of the Notice of Request to Prepare the Administrative Record of Proceedings is attached hereto as

7 Exhibit C.
CEOA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

28. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public
10 agency decision makers, such as Respondents, to document and consider the environmental

11 implications of their actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the
12 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
13 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires
14 govermental authorities, such as Respondents, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects of
15 projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
16 otherwise 'could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with
17 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts,
18 29. Where substantial evidence in the record of proceedings before the lead agency
19 supports a "fair argument" that one or more significant environmental effects could occur as a
20 result of approval and implementation of a project, CEQA requires preparation of an EIR. The
21| primary function of the EIR is to discuss the important environmental consequences of the project,
22 including cumulative effects, and to provide the agency and the generäl public with mitigation
23 measures and alternatives to the project that would have less serious environmental consequences.
24 A lead agency is required to consult with responsible agencies in determining whether an EIR
25 shall be prepared.
26 30. It is a prejudiciai abuse of discretion for public agency not to proceed in the
27 mapner required by CEQA, to fail to support its decision with adequate findings, or to fail to
28 support its findings with substantial evidence in the administrative record, (Code of Civ. Proc., §
2007326.8 14465-004 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1094.5; Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.) Substantial evidence includes "facts, reasonable
assumptions predicated upon facts, and expert opinion supported by facts." (Pub. Resources Code,
§§ 21080(e)(1) and 21082.2.) Abuse of discretion in certifying an EIR may be found if the content
of the EIR does not meet the statutory and regulatory requirements or if the EIR's conclusions are
not supported by substantial evidence. (Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach
(2017) 2 Cal.5th 918.)
31.' Under CEQA, lead agencies, such as Respondents County and Board, are required
to prepare a complete and legally adequate EIR prior to approving any discretionary pröject that
9 may have a significant adverse effect on the environment. The EIR must fully disclose and
10 adequately analyze the project's potentially significant environmental effects. CEQA also requires
11 lead agencies, such as Respondents County and Board, to consider mitigation measures and
12 alternatives to the project, adopt all feasible mitigation measures and/or alternatives, determine
13 whether proposed mitigation measures will be effective in avoiding or substantially lessening the
14 project's significant environmental impacts, and to make adequate findings, including an adequate
15 statement of overriding consideration for those significant environmental impacts deemed
16  unavoidable. L'ead agencies, such as Respondents, may not avoid the duty to prepare an EIR by
17 segmenting a project into several smaller projects.
18 32. Responsible agencies, such as Respondent Caltrans, are public agencies which
19 propose to carry out or approve a project, for which the lead agency is preparing or has prepared
20 an EIR or negative declaration. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15381.) A responsible agency is to engage
21 in and respond in writing to consultation with the lead agency, comment in writing on the EIR,
22 and independently consider the EIR prepared by the lead agency to the project and "reach[] its
23  own conclusions on whether and how to approve the project involved." (Id. at § 15096(a).)
24 33. When a government agency certifies an EIR, it must exercise its independent
25 judgment and analysis.

26 STATEMENT OF FACTS

27 34. The Project is to build a mixed-use development, including residential, commercial,
28 recreational and other uses, on 1,095 acres of unincorporated and predominantly undeveloped
2007326.8 14465-004 8
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

County land along State Route 16, also known as Jackson Highway. The Project includes about
3,000 residential dwelling units of varying density, about 500,000 square feet of
commercial/office use space, and over 500 acres of open space and park uses. The EIR concludes

4 the Project will create significant and unavoidable impacts to aesthetics, agricultural resources, air
quality, biological resources, climate change, hydrology, noise, and traffic and circulation.

6 35. Real Parties in Interest initiated the Project in February 7, 2012, by filing a project
application with the County.
g 36. On January 8, 2013, the County filed a Notice of Preparation of a Draft
Environmental Impact Report for the Project.

10 37. On July 27, 2018, the County published the Draft Environmental Impact Report

11 ("draft EIR") and opened public comment for a 45-day review period.

12 38. On August 7, 2018, the Vineyard Community Planning Advisory Council

13 ("Vineyard CPAC") held a publie hearing for the Project. After receiving public comments, the
14 Vineyard CPAC voted to recommend denial of the Project due to transportation and traffic
15 concerns,

16 39, On August 16, 2018, Cordova Community Planning Advisory Commission
17 ("Cordova CPAC") held a publio hearing for the Project. After receiving publio comments, the
18 Cordova CPAC voted to recommend approval of the Project.

19 40. On September 10, 2018, the Sacramento County Planning Commission held a
20 public hearing on the Project to receive further public comments on the draft EIR. After receiving
21 public comments, the County Planning Commission closed the comment period on the draft EIR
22 and directed staff to prepare the final EIR.
23 41. On December 9, 2019, the County Planning Commission held a public hearing on
24 the Project and voted to recommend approval of the Project.
25 42. In early August 2020, the County revealed to the public that it would no longer
26 pursue relinquishment of the portion of State Route 16 bordering the Project as previously
27 anticipated in the Project design. The County had sent notice of this decision to Caltrans on
28 November 5, 2019.
20073268 14465-004 PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 43. On August 21, 2020, the County published the final EIR on the County website.

2 44. The fina BIR contains numerous, significant changes as compared to the draft EIR,
3 including, but not limited to, addition of considerable analysis and explanation regarding impacts

4 to air quality and climate change, and an additional sectioni more than four pages in length to
5 analyze energy consumption. The EIR also includes reference to a new traffic analysis in response
to comments, but fails to incorporate the new traffic analysis into review of Project impacts. The
7 BIR contains an entirely new appendix evaluating transportation impacts as a measure of Vehicle
8 Miles Traveled ("VMT"). The EIR fails to consider changes in the Project setting since.the traffic
g and transportation data was collected in 2015. Further, the EIR fails to account for the County's
10 decision to abandon relinquishment of a portion of State Route 16 along the Project border,
11 originally contemplated in conjunction with the Project. Despite this significant new information
12 and changes to the Project, the County did not recirculate the BIR.
13 45. On August 27, 2020, the County published the Board agenda to its Septémber 1,
14 2020 meeting and listed the Project as an agenda item.

15 46. In the days between the date it published the final EIR, August 21, 2020, and the
16 Board's September 1, 2020 meeting, the County received 14 additional comment letters, including
17 letters from counsel for Real Parties in Interest. Petitioner's counsel submitted a comment letter on
18 August 28, 2020, outlining Petitioner's concemns regarding unanalyzed, unmitigated significant
19 traffic impacts, and other violations of CEQA.
20 47. On September 1, 2020, the Board held a public hearing on the Project. Staff
21 presented that, among otber things, the Project would include 3,075 residential units of varying
22 density and be consistent with the County of Sacramento General Plan. The number of residential
23 units to be included in the Project is inconsistent throughout the EIR. During the public comment
24 period, Petitioner's counsel spoke on bebalf of Petitioner reiterating the points in the August 28,
25 2020 letter and highlighting further deficiencies in the EIR. The Board considered the Project and
26 continued the discussion until its October 6, 2020 meeting,

27 48, On September 22, 2020, Petitioner's counsel submitted an additional comment
28 letter on behalf of Petitioner to the Board, elaborating on points and questions from the September
2007326.8 14465-004 10
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1, 2020 publio hearing and listing additional deficiencies in the BIR traffic analysis and mitigation

2 measures.

49. On October 6, 2020, Petitioner's counsel spoke again at the Board's meeting during
public comment on the Project, reiterating Petitioner's points in the September 22, 2020 letter and
5 highlighting further deficiencies in the EIR. County staff responded to Petitioner's comments that
6 "EIRs are not meant to be perfect" and that the public comment on the Project had closed. The
7 Board certified the EIR and approved the Project.

8 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE/PUBLIC BENEFIT

9 50. Petitioner brings this action pursuant to Code of Civil Provedure section 1021.5, the
10 private attorney general doctrine, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights
11  affecting the public interest.

12 51. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a clear and significant
13 benefit on the citizens of Sacramento and Amador Counties, by requiring Respondents to carry out
14 their duties under CEQA and other applicable laws before approving the Project.
15 52. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a clear and significant
16| benefit on the general public by requiring Respondents to adequately consider, analyze, and
17| mitigate significant impacts to the environment prior to approving the Project, protecting residents
18 and guests to not only the immediate Project vicinity, but also a larger region secondarily
19 impacted by on-site significant Project impacts.

20 53. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will also result in the enforcement of
21  important rights affecting the public interest by compelling Respondents to engage in a legally
22 adequate analysis of the Project, and to ensure that the public has a meaningful opportunity to
23 review and comment on the impacts and mitigation measures for the Project.

24 54. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement make an award of attorneys'
25 fees appropriate in this case. Without this Petition, Respondents and Real Party in Interest will
26 proceed with a plan and development that will cause significant, unmitigated environmental
27 | impacts that might otherwise have been reduced or avoided through legally adequate
28 environmental review and the adoption of feasible mitigation measures. Granting the relief

1 requested by Petitioner would confer a significant benefit on a large class of people, in that
2 fundamental rules of law would be affected. The cost of pursuing this litigation transcends
3 Petitionet's personal stake in the matter.
IRREPARABLE HARM

5 55. Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA, as set forth in this Petition, constitutes
a prejudicial abuse of discretion within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure and CEQA. (See
7 Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5; Pub. Resources Code, $8 21168, 21168.5.)
8 56. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the
9  law within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 1086. Unless this Court issues a writ of
10 mandate setting aside Respondents' approval of the Project for fallure to conduct adequate
11  environmental review and orders Respondents to comply with the law, the environmental interests
12 of Petitioner and the public that are protected by those laws will be substantially and irreparably
13 harmed. No other legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioner for the harm to its
14 beneficial interests, and to the environment, occasioned by Respondents' unlawful conduct.

15 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

16 57. Petitioner is entitled to declaratory relief under Code of Civil Procedure section
17 1060 because an actual controversy exists between Petitioner and Respondents, Petitioner
18 contends that Respondents have acted in violation of applicable laws and must therefore vacate
19 and set aside the Project approval. Petitioner is informed and believes that Respondents dispute
20 this contention. A judicial resolution of this controversy is therefore appropriate and necessary.
21 58. Petitioner is entitled to injunctive relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 526
22 because approval of the Project threatens irreparable environmental harm. Unless enjoined,
23 Respondents will implement the Project despite their lack of compliance with CEQA and other
24 applicable laws, causing undue and unnecessary environmental degradation. Petitioner would
25 thereby suffer irreparable harm due to Respondents' failures to take the required steps to evaluate
26 environmental impacts to, among other things, transportation, greenhouse gas emissions, access to
27 emergency services, air quality, and safety risks associated with each, Injunctive relief is thus

warranted under Code of Civil Procedure section 525, et sèq. and Public Resources Code section
2 21168.9 to prevent irreparable harm to the environment.
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

Violation of CEQA - Fatlure to Adequately Describe the Project and Project Impacts

59. (Against Respondents County and Board)
CEQA requires an BIR disclose any potentially significant environmental impacts
of the project and inform decision-makers and the general public of mitigation measures and
8 alternatives to the project that would avoid or substantially lesson those impacis.

60. The EIR fails to provide a clear timeline for Project buildout. The EIR states "full
10 buildout of the Project will ocour over a span of decades and will be driven by prevailing market.
11 conditions in any given year." This statement lacks any description of the market conditions that
12 may affect the Project or to what degree those conditions may affect the Project. To this point, the
13 EIR fails as an informative document for decision-makers and the public.

14 61. The EIR is inconsistent, and thus inaccurate, in describing the Project and its
15 impacts. For example, the Project description in the EIR provides that the Project will develop
16 2,915 residential units, but elsewhere the EIR. states that the Project will develop 3,075 residential
17| units, a 160 residential unit discrepancy not analyzed.

18 62. +

Respondents failed to act in a manner required by CEQA with respect to the Project
19 because they failed to adequately address, analyze, or otherwise consider the environmental
20 | impacts of the Project. The EIR is conclusory and imprecise by relying on statements including,
21 but not limited to, "the Project is consistent with the General Plan." Respondents are required to
22 support assertions with information and analysis to inform the public. These baseless statements
23| fall below that requirement; accordingly, the EIR is not a sufficient, informative document and
24 Respondents' decisions are unsupported by substantial evidence.

25 63. The EIR fails to adequately consider impacts to transportation and traffic. For
26| instance, the EIR relies on "policies that discourage automobile use" to conclude the "increased
27| use of active transportation modes…as well as increased public transit would result in reductions
28 in [Vehicle Miles Traveled] and energy use." The policies articulated in the EIR, however, do not
2007326.8 13
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE: COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

support this conclusion. The timing and implementation for the Project's transit system is
2 undefined in the EIR, except that it will be complete at full Project buildout, which will be "over a
span of decade's." Thus, by the time the transit system is built, impacts from preconstruction,
construction, early residents, arid other community members will have already occutred. These
impacts are not adequately analyzed or otherwise addressed in the BIR. Any mitigation to be
provided by the transit system laoks reasonable definition and certainty, Respondents' conclusion
7 that policies in the EIR that discourage automobile use will in fact reduce transportation and
8 energy impacts from the Project is unsupported by informnation and proper analysis.

9 64. Respondents failed to apply the proper metric to analyze traffic impacts. A segment
10 of State Route 16 borders the Project site and is the responsibility of Respondent Caltrans. As a

11 State highway, the segment is required to be evaluated under the Caltrans performance thresholds
12 for State highways. Respondents failed to apply and analyze Project impacts using this metrio in
13 | the EIR.

14 65. The EIR fails to adequately measure and inform the public on impacts to
15 transportation by providing an unclear position on if the proper metric is Level of Service ("LOS")
16 or Vchicle Miles Traveled ("VMT"). The draft EIR measures impacts to traffic in changes to LOS.
17 Then, the EIR includes as an appendix "NewBridge Specific Plan Revised VMT analysis" which
18  analyzes transportation impacts as a measure of VMT. Further, there is a comment letter from
19 Real Party in Interest's counsel stating that the EIR was not required to use LOS or VMT. The BIR.
20 fails to be an internally-consistent, educational document that adequately informs decision-makers
21 and the public on the Projeot's environmental impacts.

22 66. The EIR fails to analyze secondary impacts from significant impacts to
23 transportation. Secondary impacts include, but are not limited to, increased first responder
24 response times and decreased fire department access. While the EIR includes some discussion of
25 public services within the Project vicinity, it fails to account for the increased traffic and
26 transportation impacts to public services passing through the Project area to reach. the foothills
27 community. After the numerous devastations to entire communities from wildfires and lack of
28 sufficient access to and from them, this EIR ignores that placing thousands of new commuters in
2007326.8 14465-004 14
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 the area without widening roads, State Route 16, and/or adding additional streets, existing streets
2 and highways will be so congested as to create additional secondary risks to the public's safety and
3 welfare. The EIR fails to include relevant, updated, and complete information related to traffic and
4 secondary impacts from increased traffic.

5 67. The EIR fails to analyze and nitigate increased VMT from commuters who will

6 choose to take routes that are longer but less congested, which is a reasonably anticipated result
and potentially significant impact from the Project.
8 68. The EIR fails to adequately evaluate cumulative impacts of the Project or address

9 the Projeot's incremental effects when combined with the effects of past, current; and future
10 projects in the vicinity. (CEQA Guidelines, $8 15064(h)(1), 15130(a), and 15355.)

11 69. As a result 6f the foregoing defects, Respondents did not proceed in the manner
12 required by law to prepare an adequate EIR that informed decision-makers and the public of the
13 Project's environmental impacts. Accordingly, the approval of the Project and certification of the
14 EIR must be set aside. :

15 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

16 Violation of CEQA - Failure to Support Findings with Substantial Evidence
17 (Against Respondents County and Board)

18 70. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every paragraph of this

19 Petition as though set forth in full herein.

20 71, CEQA requires that a public agency make findings supported by substantial
21 evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21002; CBQA Guidelines, § 15091.)

22 72. Respondents adopted a statement of overriding considerations that stated the
23 Project "will result in significant adverse environmental effects on aesthetics, air quality,
24 biological resources, hydrology and water quality, noise, public utilities, and traffic and circulation
25 that cannot be avoided even with the adoption of all feasible mitigation measures." Respondents
26 failed to support this with substantial evidence, including in the following ways,

27 73. Respondents' finding that the County adopted all feasible mitigation measures to
28  lessen the significant impact to traffic and circulation is not supported by substantial evidence in
2007326.8 14465-004 15
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

the record. The EIR rejects mitigation measures to transportationi impacts "because improvements
necessary to improve the LOS to E are not feasible due to environmental, right-of-way, financial

3 and other constrains." There is no explanation why the proposed mitigation measure is in fact
infeasible, and this conclusory statement does not meet the requirement that findings of
infeasibility be justified with substantial evidence. :

74. Respondents' finding that the Project is consistent with the County of Sacramento
General Plan ("General Plan") is not supported by substantial evidence. CEQA requires an EIR
discuss any inconsistencies between a project and the applicable general plan. (CEQA Guidelines,

9 § 15125(d).) The EIR states that the Project is consistent with the General Plan but fails to provide
10 substantial evidence, or any evidence, to support the statement. The General Plan Transportation
11 Polioy Plan goals include to "promote a balanced and integrated system to maximize mobility in a
12  safe and efficient manner" and "manage travel ou the roadway system and meximize the operating
13 efficiency of transportation facilities in order to teduce impacts on air quality and to minimize the
14 need for new or expanded facilities." However, the EIR contains no ind ependent analysis; rather,
15 in a purely conclusory fashion, it simply states that the Project is consistent with General Plan
16 Policies. This is particularly egregious given the information in the EIR that directly contradicts
17| this conclusion. Furthermore, the Project is inconsistent with these goals because it will create
18 unanalyzed, unmitigated impacts to traftic and transportation.

19 75, The Project is further inconsistent with General Plan policies and programs,
20 including, but not limited to, programs and policies directed at circulation and transportation
21 planning in the following ways:
22 a. The Project fails to incorporate capital costs for transit, as required by Cl-
23 27.

24 b. The Project fails to collaborate with transit service providers on phased
25 implementation of trausit services, as required by CI-30.

26 , The Project has no plan or analysis for "intelligent transportation system
27 strategies (ITS) within the County's high-demand travel corridors and support efforts to deploy
28 ITS strategies.on a regional level," as required by CI-39.
2007326.8 14465-004 16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

d. • The Project fails to include any transportation systems management
2 program to manage travel demand associated with the Project, as required by CI-40.

e. Respondents failed to "collaborate with other agencies to develop measures .
to provide for more efficient traffic flow, reduce vehicular travel demand, and meet air quality
5 goals," as required by CI-42.

6 76. Respondents were made aware of these deficiencies and failed to provide analysis
and explanation on why the findings were sufficient and supported by substantial evidence in the
8 record. In fact, staff's reassurances to the Board of Supervisors was not that the EIR achieved these
objectives, but that the EIR need not be perfect. By doing so, Respondents failed to proceed in the
10 manner required by law.
11 77. Respondents failed to adequately respond to comments regarding the sufficiency of
12 the EIR and feasible mitigation measures submitted by Petitioner, other members of the public,
13 and other agencies. Instead, the few responses given to numerous comments regarding the
14 Project's impaots to, among other things, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, biological
'15 resources, and traffic and circulation are conclusory, evasive, confusing, or otherwise non-
16 responsive; contrary to the requirements of CEQA. Comment letters are part of the administrative
17 record and constitute substantial evidence. Respondent County failed to consider or respond to the
18 letters and failed to comply with CEQA.

19 78. Counsel representing Real Party in Interest submitted gubstantive responses to the
20 Board for consideration prior to certification of the EIR. The responsibility to respond to public
21 comments lies with the lead agency. Indeed, any reliance Respondents placed on Real Party in
22 Interest's letters would be misplaced first because the letters include misstatements of law,
23 particularly that the EIR is not required to use VMT or LOS as the metric for impacts to traffic and
24| circulation. Second, the letters include flat, conclusory denials of Petitioner's and other
25 commenters' concerns and provide no clarification on the issues identified and therefore do not
26 raise to the level of "substantial evidence" and do not demonstrate that the government agenoy
27 exercised independent judgement.

• .

79. Respondents' actions in certifying the EIR and approving the Project, with
unsubstantiated and incomplete findings, are arbitrary and capricious, without sufficient
3 evidentiary support, a prejudicial abuse of discretion, and are not in accordance with law.
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
Violation of CEQA - Failure to Mitigate Significant Project Impacts
(Against Respondents County and Board)

80. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every paragraph of this
8 Petition as though set forth in full herein.

81. CEQA requires a lead agency to impose all feasible mitigation measures that will
10 be effective in avoiding or substantially lessening a project's significant environmental impacts.
11 (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15370, 15126.4, and 15041.) Mitigation measures must be formulated prior
12 to certification of the' EIR and approval of the project; exceptions to this nule are narrow and few.
13 Mitigation measures must be enforceable and contain specific enforcement standards. If a
14 mitigation measure is deemed infeasible, the lead agency must explain why and support that
15 determination with substantial evidence, presented in their findings and a statement of overriding
16 considerations. (CHQA Guidelines, §§ 15091 and 15093.)
17 82. Mitigation measures that are rejected as infcasible for financial considerations
18 require a higher level.of analysis and scrutiny. The fact that an alternative may be more expensive
19 or less profitable is not sufficient to show that the alternative is financially infeasible. What is
20 required is evidence that the additional costs or lost profitability are "suffciently severe as to
21 render it impractical to proceed with the project." (See Center for Biological Diversity v. County of
22 San Bernardino (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1342.)

23 83. Respondents rejeoted mitigation measures that would reduce significant impacts to
24 traffic "because improvements necessary to improve the LOS to E [level] are not feasible due to
25 environmental, right-of-way, financial, and other constraints." Respondents failed to justify
26 rejecting the mitigation measure to a level of specificity required by CEQA.
27 84. Those mitigation measures that were adopted fail for lack of enforcement
28 mochanism and cortainty; for example:
2007326.8 14465-004 18
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE: COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

a. Mitigation measure TC-1 is inadequate for failing to include an
2 enforcement mechanism, failing to identify the party responsible for the implementation, and
3 failing to commit Respondents to an identified course of action.
b. TC-5 exprossly admits that the implementation of the mitigation measure is
not guaranteed and is also inadequate for failing to include an enforcement mechanism and failing

6 to identify the party responsible for the implementation.

85. Respondent County also committed to mitigating impacts to traffic and
8 transportation by enacting mitigation measures in the Jackson Corridor Transportation Mitigation
9 Strategy on the segment of State Route 16 that borders the Project site. Recently, the County

10 admitted that it will no longer seek relinquishment, and therefore control, of the segment. The.
11 County failed to respond and explain how it intends to implement the Jackson Corridor,
12 Transportation Mitigation Strategy without having any control of the State Route 16 segment.
13 Thus, Respondents failed to justify their findings with substantial evidence.

14 86. Respondents' actions in certifying the EIR and approving the Project premised on
15 inadequate mitigation measures and without adopting all feasible mitigation measures are in
16 violation of CEQA. Accordingly, the Project approval should be set aside and Respondents should
17 be ordered to recirculate the EIR before proceeding, if at all.
18 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

19 Violation of CEQA - Failure to Recirculate EIR

20 (Against Respondents County and Board)

21 87. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every paragraph of this
22 Petition as though set forth in full herein.

23 88. CEQA requires the recirculation of an BIR when "significant new information" is
24 added to the EIR after public notice is given of the draft EIR and before certification. (Pub.
25 Resources Code, § 21092.1; CEQA Guidelines, § 15088.5.) "'Information' can include changes in
26 the project or environmental setting as well as additional data or other-information." (Id. at §
27 15088.5(a).)

28

2007326.8 14465-004 19
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 89. The draft EIR relied on data collected from September 2015. In the half-decade
2 since that time, the Project site and vicinity have evolved significantly in natural ways, including
3 but not limited to, climate change, wildfires, and drought, and in unnatural ways, including from
development as the Sacramento region's population grows and traffic, housing demands, and
commercial development grow in consequence. The environmental setting for the Project has
6 significantly changed and the EIR should be recirculated prior to certification.

90. When public notice of the draft EIR was published, the County was pursuing the
relinquishment of a portion of State Route 16 in conjunction with its long-term planning for the
9 area; improvements to the segment are proposed through the Jackson Corridor Transportation
10 Mitlgation Strategy, incorporated in the EIR, and required in the Transportation Impact Report for
11 the Project. These improvements were premised on relinquishment of State Route 16.
12 Approximately one month before the County's meeting to discuss the Project and EIR, County
13 staff announced that the County would not proceed with relinquishment of the segment of State
14 Route 16, therefore it would remain a Caltrans facility for the foresecable future and subject to
15 Caltrans' control, rather than the County's control. This is à significant change in the Project and
16 merits recirculation.

17 91. The traffic analysis in the EIR is based on 2015 data. Respondents, however, relied
18. on a 2018 traffic analysis in order to respond to public comments. Submitted comments asked
19 Respondents to incorporate cumulative traffic analyses that were available in 2018 at the time that
20 the draft EIR was published and were actually incorporated into the Mather South Project and the
21 West Jackson Project. In fact, Respondents acknowledged that the 2018 data was available at the
22 time the draft EIR was published and referenced and relied on it in order to respond to comments.
23 At'the samé time, Respondents improperly refused to provide adequate and appropriate updates to
24 the BIR and recirculate it for review. The inclusion and reliance on the 2018 traffic analysis is
25 significant additional data and analysis meriting an appropriate update and recirculation of the
26 EIR.

27 92. Respondents added substantial new information to the EIR by incorporating a new
28 appendix titled "NewBridge Specific Plan Revised VMT Analysis," which included eight pages of
2007326.8 14465-004 20
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 novel analysis and conclusions on the Project's potential impacts to transportation. Specifically,
2 the appendix applied the novel metric "Vehicle Miles Traveled" to residential, office, and retail

3 components of the Project. The memorandum also includes a new table of analysis. The volume of
highly-technical information, even regardless of the appendix's conclusions, raises to the level of
5 significant new information that merits recirculation. Notably, the appendix is dated August 4,
2020, less than a month before Respondent Board's hearing on the Project and EIR. Indeed, it is
7 unlikely that the Board had time to adequately consider the new information, much less the public
8 had time to adequately read and comment on it.

9 93, Respondents substantially revised the Air Quality and Climate Change sections to
10 the EIR, adding considerable analysis and explanation. While Petitioner has issue with the
11 inconsistencies and deficiencies in the new information, Petitioner also posits that this is
12 significant new data and analysis meriting recirculation"

13 94. Respondents added a new analysis section in the HIR that is more than four pages
14 in length in order to analyze energy consumption associated with the Project. This is significant
15 new information meriting recirculation.
16 95. Respondents have added significant new information to the EIR and changed the
17 Project, and failed to recirculate the EIR. Respondents have failed to proceed in' a manner required
18 by CEQA and applicable law. Accordingly, the Project approval should be set aside and
19 Respondents should be ordered to recirculate the EIR before proceeding, if at all..
20 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

21 Violation of CEQA - Procedural Violations of CEQA

22 (Against Respondents County and Board)

23 96. Petitioner 1 alleges and incorporates by reference each and every paragraph of this
24 Petition as though set forth in full herein.

25 97. CEQA requires a lead agency to consult with affected transportation agencies. (See
26 CEQA Guidelines 15086(a)(5).)

27 98. ACTC is a transportation agency to the County directly neighboring the Project site
28 and will be affected by the Project. Respondents failed to consult with ACTC, even after being
2007326,8 14465-004 21
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

madé aware of ACTC's concerns with the Project and the Project's impacts on ACTC's interests.
2 Respondents also failed to provide ACTC any notice of the Project at any time during the review
3 process. Respondents' failure to consult with ACTC, or provide any notice to the transportation
4 agency at all, prevented informed decision-making as it left Respondents without the benefit of
5 hearing from informed parties on the potentially significant impacts of the Project. Further,
6 Respondents failed to comply with the procedural requirements of CEQA.
99. CEQA requires that the publio be allowed to participate in the review and
consideration of proposed projects in an effort to ensure that environmental considerations play a
9 significant role in government decision-making.

10 100. Respondents failed, to provide adequate opportunity for the public to provide
11 comments on the Project and EIR. Public meetings regarding the Board's certification of the BIR
12 and approval of the Project have taken place exclusively during the COVID-19 global pandemic
13  and been restricted, in part, by the Board's COVID-19 procedures. Under these procedures, in
14 order to give an oral comment, commenters were required to stop listening to portions of the
15 meeting, including the Board's deliberations on the Project and EIR, and wait on a phone line until
16 "admitted" to the meeting by the Board clerk. Comments that were able to be given at Board
17 meetings lagged. Further, comments were interrupted or wholly out off. Respondents were
18 deprived of the entirety of the public. comments on the Project and the opportunity to make an
19 informed, and therefore legally-adequate, decision. Instead, Respondents' actions demonstrate a
20  focus on concluding public comment posthaste to streamline the Project's approval.

21 101. Respondents fuurther failed to provide sufficient apportunities for the public to
22 comment on the Project and BIR by neglecting to follow their own procedures related to timed
23 agenda items. The Project and EIR were timed agenda items for both Board meetings, Despite
24 this, the Board did not hear the matter until multiple hours after the assigned start time. Interested
25 members of the public, including ACTC Board members, were deprived of the opportunity to
26 comment because the County Board did not offer the opportunity to give public comment within
27 | any reasonable time of the timed agenda item.

28

20073268 14465-004 22
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR,
DECLARATORY AND-INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

102. For legally adequate public participation to ocour, the public must also be afforded
2 notice prior to decisions being made. Respondents failed to provide notice adequate to ensure the

3 public is informed of their consideration of the Project. During a global pandemic limiting the
4public's access to in-person meetings, planning sessions, County resources, and other opportunities

5 to engage with the Board and County staff, Respondents feiled to provide notice sufficient to
6 inform the public of their consideration of the Project. The County published the BIR, over 1,000
7 pages and over 20 exhibits, only ten (10) days prior to their public hearing and only on its website.

8 This is insufficient notice to allow meaningful review of the document and public participation.
The truncated public notice prevented informed decision-making and left Respondents without the
10 benefit of hearing from the public.
11 103. The County also failed to adequately provide or disclose the draft EIR on its
12 website, impeding public review and consideration of the Project. (Pub. Resources Code, §
13 21152.)

14 104. Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA's noticing requirements represents a
15 failure to proceed in a manner according to law. Accordingly, the Project approval should be set
16 aside.

17 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

18 Violation of CEQA - Failure to Meet Responsible Agency Requirements
19 (Against Respondent Caltrans)
20 105, Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every paragraph of this
21 Petition as though set forth in full herein.

22 106. CEQA requires a lead agency to consult with each responsible agency to a project
23 and include the responsible agency's written response in the EIR. (CEQA Guidelines, $§ 15096(b)
24 and 15381,) CEQA requires a responsible agency to independently determine if the EIR meets the
25 requirements of CBQA. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15096(a).)
26 107, Respondent Caltrans manages the State's highway system; any development

• 27 activity on or near the highway requires Caltrans' discretionary approval. The Project borders State
28 Route 16, a highway managed by Caltrans. The Project requires Caltrans' discretionary approval
2007326,8 14465-004 23
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 for development along State Route 16 including, but not limited to, easement rights and
2 development permits. Because Caltrans will exercise discretionary approval over the Project, or
: U) any portion thereof, Caltrans is a "responsible agency" pursuant to CEQA for the Project and
required to comply with CEQA's substantive and procedural requirements prior to approving the
5 Project, or any portion thereof.

6 108. The EIR fails to include a written response to the EIR from Respondent Caltrans.
109. The EIR fails to include information showing that Respondent County adequately
8 consulted with Respondent Caltrans, if at all.
110. Respondent Caltrans failed to make an independent determination, or any
10 determination at all, that the Project and EIR meet the requirements of CEQA.

11 111. Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA's mandates applicable to responsible
12 agencies and their participation in the review process represents a failure to proceed in a manner
13 according to law. Accordingly, the Projeot approval should be set aside.
14

15 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

16 For Infunctive Relief

17 (Agaiust All Respondents)
112. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every paragraph of this
18 Petition as though set forth in full herein.

19 113. The Project permitted by Respondent Board's October 6, 2020 approval adversely
20 and significantly affects, and will continue to affect, the environment and interfere with the public,
21 including Petitioner's, use and enjoyment of an environment free of the significant environmental
22 impacts from the Project.

23 114. The initiation of and development of the Project is an unpermitted and
24 impermissible project, which adversely impacts Petitioner and the community.
25 115. For each of thesè reasons, Petitioner lacks an adequate remedy if Respondents are
26 allowed to proceed with the Project prior to such time as this Court determines whether the
27 Respondent Board's actions to certify the BIR and approve the Project were lawful.

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5, that on

4 November 5, 2020, Petitioner and Plaintiff Amador County Transportation Commission filed the
attached petition for writ of mandate against the County of Sacramento, the Board of Supervisors
6 of the County of Sacramento, and the State of California, California Department of Transportation

7 aka Caltrans, (collectively, "Respondents") in the Sacramento County Superior Court. The petition
8 alleges that Respondents violated the California Environmental Quality Act, codified at Public
Resources Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"). The petition further alleges that by certifying a
10| legally-inadequate Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") that failed to comply with CEQA's
11 substantive and procedural mandates, the approval of the NewBridge Specific Plan project (the
12 "Project") should also be overturned because it is based on the defective EIR. The Project will
13 facilitate the development of nearly 1,100 acres in unincorporated, predominantly-undeveloped
14 County area, into a mixed-use development including residential, commercial, recreational, and
15 other uses. A copy of the petition is attached to this notice as Attachment 1.

16 You are receiving this Notice because Respondent County of Sacramento identified your
17 agency a as a CEQA "responsible agency" that has jurisdiction over a natural resource affected by
18 the NewBridge Specific Plan project that is the subject of this challenge. Your agency has not
19 been named in the action. A copy of the November 20, 2020, correspondence of the County of
20 Sacramento containing the list of responsible agencies is attached to this notice as Attachment 2.

1 Transportation ("Caltrans"), and Does 1 through 50, inclusive (collectively, "Respondents") to
2 compel Respondents to rescind their certification of the NewBridge environmental impact repoxt
3 ("EIR") and related approvals ("Project approvals") for failure to follow the mandates of the
California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code sections 21000 et seq. ("CEQA")
5 and the CEQA Guidelines, California Code of Regulations, Title 14, sections 15000 et seq.
("CEQA Guidelines"),

2. The Petition relates to Respondent Board's October 6, 2020 approval of the
8 NewBridge Specific Plan, which will facilitate the development of nearly 1,100 acres in
9 unincorporated, predominantly undeveloped County area into a mixed-use development including
10 residential, commercial, recreational, and other uses ("Project"), and certification of the Project
11 EIR.

12 3. The NewBridge Specific Plan is a "project" under CEQA. CEQA requires that a
13 public agency undertaking project with the potential to impact the environment must prepare an
14 EIR that uncovers, analyzes, and adopts all feasible measures to mitigate those effects.
15 In approving the Project, Respondents prepared, relied on, and certified an EIR that
16 falls well below CEQA's minimum standards. Construction and operation of the Project would
17 generate significant environmental impacts that are not adequately analyzed in the EIR and will
18 not be adequately mitigated by Project obligations and thus in violation of CEQA. Respondents
19 failed to fully evaluate and disclose the reasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the
20 Project, failed to support their findings with substantial evidence, failed to recirculate the EIR in
21 light of significant new information, and otherwise failed to comply with CEQA in preparation
22 and certification of the EIR, as alleged below.
23 5. In response to Petitioner's and other community members' multiple comment letters
24 and comments lodged during publie hearings regarding the issues identified below, all part of the
25  administrative record in this matter, Respondents cite to the length of the planning process, EIR-
26 page count, and 20 plus appendices to support they have met the mandates of CEQA. However,
27| these factors are not dispositive of the EIR's legal sufficiency,
28
2007326.8 14465-004 2
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

6. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the Project will result
2 in significant and adverse impacts to transportation, greenhouse gas emissions, access to
3 emergency services, air quality, and create new safety risks associated with each. As such, the

4 Project will create significant environmental impacts.

5 7. Given the violations of CEQA, described in greater detail below, Respondents'
6 approval of the Project and certification of the EIR weie done in violation of CEQA. (See Pub.
Resources Code, $§ 21168 and 21168.5 and Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5.) For these reasons,
8 Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court isgue a peremptory writ of mandate commanding
•9 Respondents to rescind, set aside, and void any arid all resolutions or documents related to the
10. Project approval and certification of the EIR, as well as any other legislative, quasi-adjudicatory,
11 or other discretionary or ministerial approvals of the Project or any portion thereof, and grant
12 Petitioners injunctive relief unless and until Respondents comply with CEQA's mandates.
13 PARTIES

14 8, Petitioner Amador County Transportation Commission is, and at all times relevant
15 herein, a State-designated regional transportation planning agency, formed pursuant to
16 Government Code sections 14522, et seq., and the local transportation commission to the County
17 of Amador. Petitioner's service areà is all of Amador County, which neighbors Sacramento County
18 to the west, connected by State Route 16/Jackson Highway ("State Route 16"). Petitioner's mission
19 includes the protection and advancement of local, regional, and intrastate travel for the benefit of
20 Amador County residents, workers, business people, and visitors.
21 9. Respondent County of Sacramento is, and at all times relevant herein was, a
22 political subdivision of the State of Califoria, and is a "local agency" as defined in section 54951
23 of the Government Code, The County also functions as a lead agency under CEQA. In this
24 capacity, the County is charged with evaluating the potential environmental impacts of the Project,
25 identifying Project alternatives and mitigation measures, and otherwise complying with the
26 substantive and procedural requirements of CEQA. Respondent Board of Supervisors of the
27 County of Sacramento is, and at all times relevant herein was, the decision-making body for
28 Respondent County,
2007326.8 14465-004 3
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

10. Respondent Caltrans is an executive department of the State of California,
2 headquartered in Sacramento, California, and manages the State's highway system; Caltrans is the
owner-operator of State Route 16. State Route 16 forms the southemn border of the Project and any

4 development activity on or near the highway requires Caltrans' discretionary approval. Approvals
from Caltrans required by the Project will include, but not be limited to, easement rights and
6 development permits on and around State Route 16. Caltrans is therefore a "responsible agency"
for the Project under CEQA and required to comply with CEQA's substantive and procedural
8 requirements prior to approving the Project, or any portion thereof. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15381.)

11. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities, whether individual,
10 corporate; associate or otherwise, of Respondents Does through 50, inclusive, and therefore sue
11 said Respondents under fiotitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition to reflect their true
12 names and capacities at such time that they become known.
13 12. Real Party in Interest East Sacramento Ranch, LLC is listed as the applicant for the
14 Project on filings with the State Clearinghouse and represented itself as the Projeot applicant
15 during public hearings and through communications during the pendency of the Project.

16 13. Petitioner is currently unaware of the true names or capacities, whether individual,
17 corporate, associate or otherwise, of Real Parties in Interest Roes 1 through 50, inclusive, and
18 therefore sue said Real Parties in Interest under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this
19 Petition to reflect their true names and capacities at such time that they become known.
20 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

21 14. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged herein puisuant to Code of
22 Civil Procedure sections 394, 395, 401, 1085, 1087, and 1094.5 and Public Resources Code
23 sections 21168 and 21168.5.

24 15. Venue is proper in Sacramento County pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
25 394(a) as Respondent County is within Sacramento County and pursuant to section 395 as
26 Respondent Caltrans is headquartered and operates in Sacramento County.

STANDING AND EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

16. Petitioner has standing in this aotion where Petitioner seeks the enforcement of a
public duty by Respondents County and Board. Respondents County and Board are public entities
4 with a mandatory duty to comply with CEQA and all othèr applicable laws when approving the
Project. Petitioner alleges that Respondents County and Board failed to satisfy this duty by

6 certifying a legally-inadequate EIR that, as explained in more detail below, lacks requisite analysis
7 and mitigation when approving the Project in reliance on that EIR and is unsupported by
substantial evidence in the record.

17. Petitioner has standing in this action where Petitioner seeks the enforcement of a
10 public duty by Respondent Caltrans. Respondent Caltrans is a public entity with a mandatory duty
11 to comply with CEQA and all other applicable laws. As described in further detail below,
12 Respondent Caltrans is a responsible agency to the Project and, in that role, has a duty to meet
13 certain procedural and substantive requirements of CEQA prior to approval of the Project.
14 Petitioner alleges that Respondent Caltrans failed to satisfy this duty by not complying with
15 CEQA's requirements prior to Respondent County and Board's certification of a legally-inadequate
16 EIR.

17 18. Petitioner has a direct and substantial beneficial interest in Respondents'*
18 compliance with their statutory duties under CEQA because Petitioner is the regional
19 transportation planning agency to Amador County, which adjoins Sacramento County via State
20  Route 16, which will be significantly impacted by the Project as approved.
21 19, Petitioner took advantage of numerous opportunities where Petitioner knew
22 Respondents may be present to bring these issues to the attention of Respondents prior to approval
23 of the Project. Petitioner's counsel submitted comment letters each to Respondent County and
24 Respondent Caltrans. Petitioner's counsel also spoke on behalf of Petitioner at Respondent Board's
25 meetings discussing the Project and EIR on September 1, 2020 and October 6, 2020.
26 20. CEQA further allows a petitioner who objected to a project to allege in a writ
27 petition all deficiencies asserted by others. (Citizens for Clean Energy v, City of Woodland (2014)
28 225 Cal.App.4th 173, 191.) Petitioner, other agencies, interested groups, and individuals submitted
2007326.8 14465-004 5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE: COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

oral and written comments on the EIR and Project to Respondents, and raised each of the legal
deficiencies asserted in this Petition.

21. Respondents approved the project and certified the Project EIR on October 6, 2020.
4 This is final agency action.

22. Petitioner performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition, including
serving notice upon Respondents indicating its intent to commence this action, and fully exhausted
7 any available administrative remedies. In addition to claims raised by Petitioner, various other
8 parties have raised concerns regarding impacts of the Project. Petitioner incorporates each of these

9 claims, objections, and comments herein. Petitioner does not have a plain, speedy, or adequate
10 remedy in the ordinary course of law. Petitioner authorized its attorney to file this lawsuit on its
11 behalf to assert its substantial beneficiel interest in securing Respondents' compliance with the
12 law.

13 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

14 23. On October 6, 2020, Respondent Board voted to certify the EIR. and approve the
15 Project. On October 7, 2020, or soon thereafter, Respondent County posted a Notice of
16 Determination for the certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.
17- 24. The statute of limitations for a CEQA. challenge to Respondents' decision to certify
18 the EIR expires 30 days from the filing and posting of the Notice of Determination. (CEQA
19 Guidelinés, $9 15094(g) and 15112(c)(1).) This Petition is timely filed within the statute of
20 limitations.

21 NOTICE OF CEQA ACTION

22 25. On October 28, 2020, Petitioner sent a Notice of Commencement of Action
23 pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5 via U.S. mail and electronic mail to
24 Respondents thereby notifying Respondents of Petitioner's intent to file this lawsuit, which seeks
25 to set aside Respondents' approval of the Project and certification of the Project EIR. A copy of
26 the Notice of Commencement of Action is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

27 26. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
28 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by mailing a copy of the Petition to the State

Attorney General, A true and correct copy of the Service of Pleadings on the Attorney General is
attached hereto as Exhibit B and incorporated herein by reference.
PREPARATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

27. Pursuant to Public Rosources Code section 21167.6(a), Petitioner requests that
Respondent County prepare the record of administrative proceedings related to this action. A copy
of the Notice of Request to Prepare the Administrative Record of Proceedings is attached hereto as
Exhibit C.

CEOA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

28. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public
10 agency decision makers, such as Respondents, to document and consider the environmental
11 implications of their actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the
12 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
13 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires
14| governmental authorities, such as Respondents, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects of
15 projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
16 otherwise could result from, their actions. CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with
17 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.

18 29. Where substantial evidence in the record of proceedings before the lead agency
19 supports a "fair argument" that one or more significant environmental effects could occur as a
20 result of approval and implementation of a project, CHQA requires preparation of an EIR. The
21 l primary function of the EIR is to discuss the important environmental consequences of the project,
22 including cumulative effects, and to provide the agency and the generäl public with mitigation
23 measures and alternatives to the project that would have less serious environmental consequences.
24 A lead agency is required to consult with responsible agencies in determining whether an EIR
25 shall be prepared.
26 30. It is a prejudicia abuse of discretion for a public agency not to proceed in the
27 mapner required by CEQA, to fail to support its decision with adequate findings, or to fail to
28 support its findings with substantial evidence in the administrative record, (Code of Civ. Proc., §
2007326.8 14465-004 7
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 1094.5; Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.) Substantial evidence includes "facts, reasonable
assumptions predicated upon facts, and expert opinion supported by facts." (Pub. Resources Code,
3 §§ 21080(e)(1) and 21082.2.) Abuse of discretion in certifying an EIR may be found if the content

4 of the EIR does not meet the statutory and regulatory requirements or if the EIR's conclusions are
5 not supported by substantial evidence. (Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach
6 (2017) 2 Cal.5th 918.)

7 31.' Under CEQA, lead agencies, such as Respondents County and Board, are required
8 to prepare a complete and legally adequate EIR. prior to approving any discretionary project that
9 may have a significant adverse effect on the environment. The EIR must fully disclose and
10 adequately analyze the project's potentially significant environmental effects. CEQA also requires
11 lead agencies, such as Respondents County and Board, to consider mitigation measures and
12 alternatives to the project, adopt all feasible mitigation measures and/or alternatives, determine
13 whether proposed mitigation measures will be effective in avoiding or substantially lessening the
14 project's significant environmental impacts, and to make adequate findings, including an adequate
15 statement of overriding consideration for those significant environmental impacts deemed
16 unavoidable. L'ead agencies, such as Respondents, may not avoid the duty to prepare an EIR by
17 segmenting : project into several smaller projects.
18 32. Responsible agencies, such as Respondent Caltrans, are public agencies which
19 propose to carry out or approve project, for which the lead agency is preparing or has prepared
20 an EIR or negative declaration. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15381.) A responsible agency is to engage
21  in and respond in writing to consultation with the lead agency, comment in writing on the EIR,
22 and independently consider the EIR prepared by the lead agency to the project and "reach[ its
23 | own conclasions on whether and how to approve the project involved," (Id. at § 15096(a).)
24 33. When a govemnment agency certifies an EIR, it must exercise its independent
25 judgment and analysis.
26 STATEMENT OF FACTS
27 34. The Project is to build a mixed-use development, including residential, commercial,
28 recreational and other uses, on 1,095 acres of unincorporated and predominantly undeveloped
2007326.8 14465-004 8
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 County land along State Route 16, also known as Jackson Highway. The Project includes about
2 3,000 residential dwelling units of varying density, about 500,000 square feet of
3  commercial/office use space, and over 500 acres of open space and park uses. The EIR concludes
4| the Project will create significant and unavoidable impacts to aesthetics, agricultural resources, air
5 quality, biological resources, climate change, hydrology, noise, and traffic and circulation.

35. Real Parties in Interest initiated the Project in February 7, 2012, by filing a project
7 application with the County.
8 36. On January 8, 2013, the County filed a Notice of Preparation of a Draft
Environmental Impact Report for the Project,

10 37. On July 27, 2018, the County published the Draft Environmental Impact Report
11 ("draft EIR") and opened public comment for a 45-day review period.
12 38. On August 7, 2018, the Vineyard Community Planning Advisory Council
13  ("Vineyard CPAC") held a public hearing for the Projeot. After receiving public comments, the
14 Vineyard CPAC voted to recommend denial of the Project due to transportation and traffio
15 concerns.

16 39. On August 16, 2018, Cordova Community Planning Advisory Commission
17 ("Cordova CPAC") held a public hearing for the Project. After receiving public comments, the
18 Cordova CPAC voted to recommend approval of the Project.

19 40. On September 10, 2018, the Sacramento County Planning Commission held a
20 public hearing on the Project to receive further public comments on the draft EIR. After receiving
21 public comments, the County Planning Commission closed the comment period on the draft EIR
22 and directed staff to prepare the final EIR.
23 41. On December 9, 2019, the County Planning Commission held a public hearing on
24 the Project and voted to recommend approval of the Project,
25 42. In early August 2020, the County revealed to the public that it would no longer
26 pursue relinquishment of the portion of State Route 16 bordering the Project as previously
27 anticipated in the Project design. The County had sent notice of this decision to Caltrans on
28 November 5, 2019.
2007326.8 14465-004 9
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

43, On August 21, 2020, the County published the final EIR on the County website.

2 44. The final EIR contains numerous, significant changes as compared to the draft EIR,
3 including, but not limited to, addition of considerable analysis and explanation regarding impacts

4 to air quality and climate change, and an additional section more than four pages in length to
5 analyze energy consumption. The BIR also includes reference to a new traffic analysis in response

6 to comments, but fails to incorporate the new traffic analysis into review of Project impacts. The
7 EIR contains an entirely new appendix evaluating transportation impacts as a measure of Vehicle
8 Miles Traveled ("VMT"). The EIR fails to consider changes in the Project setting since.the traffic

9 and transportation data was collected in 2015. Further, the EIR fails to account for the County's
10 decision to abandon relinquishment of a portion of State Route 16 along the Project border,
11 originally contemplated in conjunction with the Project. Despite this significant new information

•12 and changes to the Project, the County did not recirculate the EIR.
13 45. On August 27, 2020, the County published the Board agenda to its Septémber 1,
14 2020 meeting and listed the Froject as an agenda item.

15 46. In the days between the date it published the final EIR, August 21, 2020, and the
16 Board's September 1, 2020 meeting, the County received 14 additional comment letters, including
17 / letters from counsel for Real Parties in Interest. Petitioner's counsel submitted a comment letter On
18  August 28, 2020, outlining Petitioner's concerns regarding unanalyzed, unmitigated significant
19 traffic impacts, and other violations of CEQA.
20 47. On September 1, 2020, the Board held a public hearing on the Project. Staff
21 presented that, among other things, the Project would include 3,075 residential units of varying
22 density and be consistent with the County of Sacramento General Plan. The number of residential
23 units to be included in the Project is inconsistent throughout the EIR. During the public comment
24 period, Petitioner's counsel spoke on behalf of Petitioner reiterating the points in the August 28,
25 2020 letter and highlighting further deficiencies in the EIR. The Board considered the Project and
26 continued the discussion until its October 6, 2020 meeting,

27 48, On September 22, 2020, Petitioner's counsel submitted an additional comment
28 letter on behalf of Petitioner to the Board, elaborating on points and questions from the September
2007326.8 14465-004 10
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1, 2020 public hearing and listing additional deficiencies in the BIR traffic analysis and mitigation
2 measures.

49. On October 6, 2020, Petitioner's counsel spoke again at the Board's meeting during
public comment on the Project, reiterating Petitioner's points in the September 22, 2020 letter and
5 highlighting further deficiencies in the EIR. County staff responded to Petitioner's comments that

6 "EIRs are not meant to be perfect" and that the public comment on the Project had closed. The

7 Board certified the EIR and approved the Project.
8 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE/FUBLIC BENEFIT

50. Petitioner brings this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, the
10 private attorney general doctrine, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights
11 affecting the public interest.

12 51. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a clear and significant
13 benefit on the citizens of Sacramento and Amador Counties, by requiring Respondents to carry out
14 their duties under CEQA and other applicable laws before approving the Project.
15 52. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a clear and significant
16 benefit on the general public by requiring Respondents to adequately consider, analyze, and
17 mitigate significant impacts to the environment prior to approving the Project, protecting residents
18 and guests to not only the immediate Project vicinity, but also a larger region secondarily
19 impacted by on-site significant Project impacts.
20 53. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will also result in the enforcement of
21 important rights affecting the public interest by compelling Respondents to engage in a legally
22 adequate analysis of the Projeot, and to ensure that the public has a meaningful opportunity to
23 review and comment on the impacts and mitigation measures for the Project.
24 54. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement make an award of attorneys'
25 fees appropriate in this case. Without this Petition, Respondents and Real Party in Interest will
26 proceed with a plan and development that will cause significant, unmitigated environmental
27 impacts that might otherwise have been reduced or avoided through legally adequate
28 environmentäl review and the adoption of feasible mitigation measures. Granting the relief
2007326.8 14465-004 11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

requested by Petitioner would confer a significant benefit on a large class of people, in that

2 fundamental rules of law would be affected. The cost of pursuing this litigation transcends
3 Petitioner's personal stake in the matter.
IRREPARABLE HARM

55. Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA, as set forth in this Petition, constitutes

6 a prejudicial abuse of discretion within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure and CEQA. (See
Code of Civ. Proo., $§ 1085, 1094.5; Pub. Resources Code, §§ 21168, 21168.5.)

56. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the
law within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 1086. Unless this Court issues writ of
10 mandate setting aside Respondents' approval of the Project for failure to conduct adequate
11 environmental review and orders Respondents to comply with the law, the environmental interests
12 of Petitioner and the public that are protected by those laws will be substantially and irreparably
13 harmed. No other legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioner for the harm to its
14 beneficial interests, and to the environment, occasioned by Respondents' unlawful conduct.

• 15 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

16 57. Petitioner is entitled to declaratory relief under Code of Civil Procedure section
17 1060 because an actual controversy exists between Petitioner and Respondents. Petitioner
18 contends that Respondents have acted in violation of applicable laws and must therefore vacate
19 and set aside the Project approval. Petitioner is informed and believes that Respondents dispute
20 this contention. A judicial resolution of this controversy is therefore appropriate and necessary.
21 58. Petitioner is entitled to injunctive relief under Code of Civil Procedure section 526
22 because approval of the Project threatens irreparable environmental harm. Unless enjoined,
23 Respondents will implement the Project despite their lack of compliance with CEQA and other
24 applicable laws, causing undue and unnecessary environmental degradation. Petitioner would
25 thereby suffer irreparable harm due to Respondents' failures to take the required steps to evaluate
26 environmental impacts to, among other things, transportation, greenhouse gas emissions, access to
27 emergency services, air quality, and safety risks associated with each. Injunctive relief is thus
28

2007326,8 £4465-004 12
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 warranted under Code of Civil Procedure section 525, et seq, and Public Resources Code section
2 21168.9 to prevent inreparable harm to the environment.
3 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
Violation of CEQA Failure to Adequately Describe the Project and Project Impacts

59. (Against Respondents County and Board)
CEQA requires an EIR disclose any potentially significant environmental impäaëts
of the project and inform decision-makers and the general public of mitigation measures and
8 alternatives to the project that would avoid or substantially lessen those impacts. •.

60.

10 The EIR fails to provide clear timeline for Project buildout. The EIR states "full
buildout of the Project will occur over a span of decades and will be driven by prevailing market
11 conditions in any given year." This statement lacks any description of the market conditions that
12 may affect the Project or to what degree those conditions may affect the Project. To this point, the
13 EIR fails as an informative document for decision-makers and the public.
14 61. The EIR is inconsistent, and thus inaccurate, in describing the Project and its
15 impacts. For example, the Project description in the EIR. provides that the Project will develop
16 2,915 residential units, but elsewhere the EIR states that the Project will develop 3,075 residential
17 units, a 160 residential unit discrepancy not analyzed.
18 62. Respondents failed to act in a manner required by CEQA with respect to the Project
19 because they failed tö adequately address, analyze, or otherwise consider the environmental
20  impacts of the Project. The EIR is conclusory and imprecise by relying on statements including,
21 but not limited to, "the Project is consistent with the General Plan." Respondents are required to
22 support assertions with information and analysis to inform the public. These baseless statements
23 fall below that requirement; accordingly, the EIR is not a sufficient, informative document and
24 Respondents' decisions are unsupported by substantial evidence.

25 63. The EIR fails to adequately consider impacts to transportation and traffic. For
26 instance, the EIR relies on "policies that discourage automobile use" to conclude the "increased
27 use of active transportation modes..as well as increased public transit would result in reductions
28 in [Vehicle Miles Traveled] and energy use.' The policies articulated in the EIR, however, do not
2007326.8 14465-004 13
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

support this conclusion. The timing and implementation for the Project's transit system is
2 undefined in the EIR, except that it will be complete at full Project buildout, which will be "over a
3 span of decades." Thus, by the time the transit system is built, impacts from preconstruction,
construction, early residents, arid other community members will have already occurred. These
5 impacts are not adequately analyzed or otherwise addressed in the EIR. Any mitigation to be
6 provided by the transit system lacks reasonable definition and certainty. Respondents' conclusion
that policies in the EIR that discourage automobile use will in fact reduce transportation and
energy impacts from the Project is unsupported by information and proper analysis.

64. Respondents failed to apply the proper metric to analyze traffic impacts. A segment
10 | of State Route 16 borders the Project site and is the responsibility of Respondent Caltrans. As a
11 State highway, the segment is required to be evaluated under the Caltrans performance thresholds
12 for State highways. Respondents failed to apply and analyze Project impacts using this metric in
13 the EIR.

14 65. The EIR fails to adequately measure and inform the public on impacts to
15 transportation by providing an unclear position on if the proper metric is Level of Service ("LOS")
16 or Vehicle Miles Traveled ("VMT"). The draft EIR measures impacts to traffic in changes to LOS.
17 Then, the EIR includes as an appendix "NewBridge Specific Plan Revised VMT analysis" which
18 analyzes transportation impacts as a measure of VMT. Further, there is a comment letter from
19 Real Party in Interest's counsel stating that the EIR was not required to use LOS or VMT. The BIR
20 fails to be an internally-consistent, educational document that adequately informs decision-makers
21 and the public on the Project's environmental impacts.

22 66, The EIR fails to analyze secondary impacts from significant impacts to
23 |l transportation. Secondary impacts include, but are not limited to, increased first responder
24 response times and decreased fire department access. While the EIR includes some discussion of
25  public services within the Project vicinity, it fails to account for the increased traffic and
26 transportation impacts to public services passing through the Project area to reach the foothills
27 community. After the numerous devastations to entire communities from wildfires and lack-of
28 sufficient access to and from them, this EIR ignores that placing thousands of new commuters in
2007326.8 14465-004 14
PETITION FOR T OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

the area without widening roads, State Route 16, and/or adding additional streets, existing streets
and highways will be So congested as to create additional secondary risks to the public's safety and
welfare. The EIR fails to include relevant, updated, and complete information related to traffic and
secondary impacts from increased traffic.

67. The EIR fails to analyze and mitigate increased VMT from commuters who will

6 choose to take routes that are longer but less congested, which is a reasonably anticipated regult
and potentially significant impact from the Project,
68. The EIR fails to adequately evaluate cumulative impacts of the Project or address

9 the Project's incremental effects when combined with the effects of past, current, and future
10 projects in the vicinity. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15064(h)(1), 15130(a), and 15355.)

11 69. As a result óf the foregoing defects, Respondents did not proceed in the manner
12 required by law to prepare an adequate EIR that informed decision-makers and the public of the
13 Project's environmental impacts. Accordingly, the approval of the Project and certification of the
14 EIR must be set aside.

15 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

16 Violation of CEQA - Failure to Support Findings with Substantial Evidence
17 (Against Respondents County and Board)

18 70. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference cach and every paragraph of this
19 Petition as though set forth in full herein.
20 71. CEQA requires that a public agency make findings supported by substantial
21 ( evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, § 21002; CEQA Guidelines, § 15091.)

22 72. Respondents adopted a statement of overriding considerations that stated the
23 Project "will result in significant adverse environmental effects on aesthetics, air quality,
24 biological resources, hydrology and water quality, noise, public utilities, and traffic and circulation
25 that cannot be avoided even with the adoption of all feasible mitigation measures." Respondents
26 failed to support this with substantial evidence, including in the following ways.
27 73. Respondents' finding that the County adopted all feasible mitigation measures to

28 lessen the significant impact to traffic and circulation is not supported by substantial evidence in
2007326.8 14465-004 15
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 the record. The EIR rejects mitigation measures to transportationi impacts "because improvements
2 necessary to improve the LOS to E are not feasible due to environmental, right-of-way, financial
3 and other constrains." There is no explanation why the proposed mitigation measure is in fact
4 infeasible, and this conclusory statement does not meet the requirement that findings of
5 infeasibility be justified with substantial evidence. 2

6 74. Respondents' finding that the Project is consistent with the County of Sacramento
7 General Plan ("General Plan") is not supported by substantial evidence. CEQA requires an EIR
8 discuss any inconsistencies between a project and the applicable general plan. (CEQA Guidelines,
15125(d).) The EIR states that the Project is consistent with the General Plan but fails to provide
10 substantial evidence, or any evidence, to support the statement. The General Plan Transportation
11 Policy Plan goals include to "promote a balanced and integrated system to maximize mobility in a
12 safe and efficient manner" and "manage travel on the roadway system and maximize the operating
13 efficiency of transportation facilities in order to teduce impacts on air quality and to minimize the
14 need for new or expanded facilities." However, the EIR contains no independent analysis; rather,
15 in a purely conclusory fashion, it simply states that the Project is consistent with General Plan
16 is Policies. This is particularly egregious given the information in the EIR thet directly contradicts
17 this conclusion. Furthermore, the Project is inconsistent with these goals because it will create
18 unanalyzed, unmitigated impacts to traffic and transportation.

19 75. The Project is further inconsistent with General Plan policies and programs,
20 including, but not limited to, programs and policies directed at circulation and transportation
21 planning in the following ways:
22 8. The Project fails to incorporate capital costs for transit, as required by Cl-
23 27.

24 b. The Project fails to collaborate with transit service providers on phased
25 implementation of transit services, as required by CI-30.

26 C. The Project has no plan or analysis for "intelligent transportation system
27 strategies (ITS) within the County's high-demand travel corridors and support efforts to deploy
28 UITS strategies on a regional level," as required by CI-39.
2007326.8 14465-004 16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE: COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

d. ' The Project fails to include any transportation systems management
2 program to manage travel demand associated with the Project, as required by CI-40.

C. Respondents failed to "collaborate with other agencies to develop measures
to provide for more efficient traffic flow, reduce vehicular travel demand, and meet air quality
goals," as required by CI-42.
76. Respondents were made aware of these deficiencies and failed to provide analysis
and explanation on why the findings were sufficient and supported by substantial evidence in the
record. In fact, staff's reassurances to the Board of Supervisors was not that the EIR achieved these
9 objectives, but that the EIR need not be perfect. By doing so, Respondents failed to proceed in the
10 manner required by law.

11 77. Respondents failed to adequately respond to comments regarding the sufficiency of
12 the EIR and feasible mitigation measures submitted by Petitioner, other members of the public,
13 and other agencies. Instead, the few responses given to numerous comments regarding the
14 Project's impacts to, among other things, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, biological
'15 resources, and traffic and circulation are conclusory, evasive, confusing, or otherwise non-
16 responsive; contrary to the requirements of CEQA. Comment letters are part of the administrative
17 record and constitute substantial evidence. Respondent County failed to consider or respond to the
18 letters and failed to comply with CEQA.
19 78. Counsel representing Real Party in Interest submitted substantive responses to the
20 Board for consideration prior to certification of the EIR. The responsibility to respond to public
21 comments lies with the lead agency. Indeed, any reliance Respondents placed on Real Party in
22 Interest's letters would be misplaced first because the letters inolude misstatements of law,
23 particularly that the EIR is not required to use VMT or LOS as the metric for impacts to traffic and
24 circulation. Second, the letters include flat, conclusory denials of Petitioner's and other
25 commenters' concerns and provide no clarification on the issues identified and therefore do not
26 raise to the level of "substantial evidence" and do not demonstrate that the government agency
27 exercised independent judgement.

79. Respondents' actions in certifying the EIR and approving the Project, with
2 unsubstantiated and incomplete findings, are arbitrary and capricious, without sufficient

3 evidentiary support, a prejudicial abuse of discretion, and are not in accordance with law,
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
Violation of CEQA - Failure to Mitigate Significant Project Impacts
(Against Respondents County and Board)

80. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every paragraph of this
8 Petition as though set forth in full herein.

81. CEQA requires a lead agency to impose all feasible mitigation measures that will
10 be effective in avoiding or substantially lessening a project's significant environmental impacts.
11 (CEQA Guidelines, $8 15370, 15126.4, and 15041.) Mitigation measures must be formulated prior
12 to certification of the EIR and approval of the project; exceptions to this rule are narrow and few.
13 Mitigation measures must be enforceable and contain specific enforcement standards. If a
14 mitigation measure is deemed infeasible, the lead agency must explain why and support that
15 determination with substantial evidence, presented in their findings and a statement of overriding
16 considerations. (CEQA Guidelines, $§ 15091 and 15093.)
17 82. Mitigation measures that are rejected as infeasible for financial considerations
18 require a higher level.of analysis and scrutiny. The fact that an alternative may be more expensive
19 or less profitable is not sufficient to show that the alternative is financially infeasible. What is
20 required is evidence that the additional costs or lost profitability are "sufficiently severe as to
21 render it impractical to proceed with the project." (See Center for Biological Diversity v. County of
22 San Bernardino (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1342.)

23 83. Respondents rejected mitigation measures that would reduce significant impacts to
24 traffio "because improvements necessary to improve the LOS to E [level] are not feasible due to
25 environmental, right-of-way, financial, and other constraints." Respondents failed to justify
26 rejecting the mitigation measure to a level of specificity required by CEQA.

27 84. Those mitigation measures that were adopted fail for lack of enforcement
28 mechanism and certainty; for example:
2007326.8 14465-004 18
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

a. Mitigation measure TC-1 is inadequate for failing to include an
enforcement mechanism, failing to identify the party responsible for the implementation, and
3 failing to commit Respondents to an identified course of action.
b, TC-5 expressly admits that the implementation of the mitigation measure is
5 not guaranteed and is also inadequate for failing to include an enforcement mechanism and failing
6 to identify the party responsible for the implementation.

85. Respondent County also committed to mitigating impacts to traffic and
transportation by enacting mitigation measures in the Jackson Corridor Transportation Mitigation
Strategy on the segment of State Route 16 that borders the Project site. Recently, the County
10 admitted that it will no longer seek relinquishment, and therefore control, of the segment. The.

11 County failed to respond and explain how it intends to implement the Jackson Corridor.
12 Transportation Mitigation Strategy without having any control of the State Route 16 segment.
13 Thus, Respondents failed to justify their findings with substantial evidence.

14 86. Respondents' actions in certifying the EIR and approving the Project premised on
15 inadequate mitigation measures and without adopting all feasible mitigation measures are in
16 violation of CEQA. Accordingly, the Project approval should be set aside and Respondents should
17| be ordered to recirculate the EIR before proceeding, if at all.

18 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

19 Violation of CEQA - Failure to Recirculate EIR

20 (Against Respondents County and Board)

21 87. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every paragraph of this
22 Petition as though set forth in full herein.

23 88. CEQA requires the recirculation of an EIR when "significant new information" is
24 added to the EIR after public notice is given of the draft EIR and before certification. (Pub.
25 Resources Code, § 21092.1; CEQA Guidelines, § 15088.5.) *Information' can include changes in
26 the project or environmental setting as well as additional data or other-information." (Id. at §
27 15088.5(a).)

28

2007326.8 14465-004 19
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE: COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

89. The draft EIR, relied on data collected from September 2015. In the half-decade
since that time, the Project site and vicinity have evolved significantly in naturel ways, including
but not limited to, climate change, wildfires, and drought, and in unnatural ways, including from
development as the Sacramento region's population grows and traffic, housing demands, and
commercial development grow in consequence. The environmental setting for the Project has
significantly changed and the EIR. should be recirculated prior to certification.

90. When public notice of the draft BIR was published, the County was pursuing the
8 relinquishment of a portion of State Route 16 in conjunction with its long-term planning for the
area; improvements to the segment are proposed through the Jackson Corridor Transportation
10 Mitigation Strategy, incorporated in the EIR, and required in the Transportation Impact Report for
11 the Project. These improvements were premised on relinquishment of State Route 16.
12 Approximately one month before the County's meeting to discuss the Project and EIR, County
13 staff announced that the County would not proceed with relinquishment of the segment of State
14 Route 16, therefore it would remain a Caltrans facility for the foresecable future and subject to
15 Caltrans' control, rather than the County's control. This is a significant change in the Project and
16 merits recirculation.

17 91. The traffic analysis in the EIR is based on 2015 data. Respondents, however, relied
18 on a 2018 traffic analysis in order to respond to public comments. Submitted comments asked
19 Respondents to incorporate cumulative traffic analyses that were available in 2018 at the time that
20 the draft EIR was published and were actually incorporated into the Mather South Project and the
21 | West Jackson Project. In fact, Respondents acknowledged that the 2018 data was available at the
22 time the draft EIR was published and referenced and relied on it in order to respond to comments.
23 At'the same time, Respondents improperly refused to provide adequate and appropriate updates to
24 the EIR and recirculate it for review. The inclusion and reliance on the 2018 traffic analysis is
25 significant additional data and analysis meriting an appropriate update and recirculation of the
26 EIR.

27 92. Respondents added substantial new information to the EIR by incorporating a new
28 appendix titled "NewBridge Specific Plan Revised VMT Analysis," which included eight pages of
2007326.8 14465-004 20
• PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

novel analysis and conclusions on the Project's potential impacts to transportation. Specifically,
2 the appendix applied the novel metric "Vehicle Miles Traveled" to residential, office, and retail
components of the Project. The memorandum also includes a new table of analysis. The volume of
highly-technical information, even regardless of the appendix's conclusions, raises to the level of
significant new information that merits recirculation. Notably, the appendix is dated August 4,
6 2020, less than a month before Respondent Board's hearing on the Project and EIR. Indeed, it is
unlikely that the Board had time to adequately consider the new information, much less the public
8 | had time to adequately read and comment on it.
93, Respondents substantially revised the Air Quality and Climate Change sections to
10 the EIR, adding considerable analysis and explanation. While Petitioner has issue with the
11 inconsistencies and deficiencies in the new information, Petitioner also posits that this is
12 significant new data and analysis meriting recirculation:

13 94. Respondents added a new analysis section in the EIR that is more than four pages
14 in length in order to analyze energy consumption associated with the Project. This is significant
15 new information meriting recirculation.
16 95. Respondents have added significant new information to the EIR and changed the
17 Project, and failed to recirculate the EIR. Respondents have failed to proceed in' a manner required
18 by CEQA and applicable law. Accordingly, the Project approval should be set aside and
19 Respondents should be ordered to recirculate the EIR before proceeding, if at all.
20 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

21 Violation of CEQA - Procedural Violations of CEQA

22 (Against Respondents County and Board)

23 96. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every paragraph of this
24 Petition as though set forth in full herein.

25 97. CEQA requires lead agency to consult with affected transportation agencies. (See
26 CEQA Guidelines 15086(a)(5).)

• 27 98. ACTC is a transportation agency to the County directly neighboring the Project site
28 and will be affected by the Project. Respondents failed to consult with ACTC, even after being
2007326.8 14465-004 21
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 made aware of ACTC's concerns with the Project and the Project's impacts on ACTC's interests.

2 Respondents also failed to provide ACTC any notice of the Project at any time during the review
3 process. Respondents' failure to consult with ACTC, or provide any notice to the transportation
4 agency at all, prevented informed decision-making as it left Respondents without the benefit of
5 hearing from informed parties on the potentially significant impacts of the Project. Further,
6 Respondents failed to comply with the procedural requirements of CEQA.

99. CEQA requires that the public be allowed to participate in the review and
8 consideration of proposed projects in an effort to ensure that environmental considerations play a
9 significant role in government decision-making.

10 100. Respondents failed to provide adequate opportunity for the public to provide
11 comments on the Project and EIR. Public meetings regarding the Board's certification of the EIR
12 and approval of the Project have taken place exclusively during the COVID-19 global pandemic
13 and been restricted, in part, by the Board's COVID-19 procedures. Under these procedures, in
14 order to give an oral comment, commenters were required to stop listening to portions of the
15 meeting, including the Board's deliberations on the Project and EIR, and wait on a phone line until
16 "admitted" to the meeting by the Board clerk. Comments that were able to be given at Board
17 meetings lagged. Further, comments were interrupted or wholly cut off. Respondents were
18 deprived of the entirety of the public. comments on the Project and the opportunity to make an
19 informed, and therefore legally-adequate, decision. Instead, Respondents' actions demonstrate a
20 focus on concluding public comment posthaste to streamline the Project's approval.

21 101. Respondents further failed to provide sufficient opportunities for the public to
22 | comment on the Project and EIR by neglecting to follow their own procedures related to timed
23 agenda items. The Project and EIR were timed agenda items for both Board meetings. Despite
24 this, the Board did not hear the matter until multiple hours after the assigned start time. Interested
25 members of the public, including ACTC Board members, were deprived of the opportunity to
26 | comment because the County Board did not offer the opportunity to give public comment within
27  any reasonable time of the timed agenda item.

28

2007326.8 14465-004 22
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE: COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND•INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

102. For legally adequate public participation to occur, the public must also be afforded
2 notice prior to decisions being made. Respondents failed to provide notice adequate to ensure the
public is informed of their consideration of the Project. During a global pandemic limiting the

4 public's access to in-person meetings, planning sessions, County resources, and other opportunities
S to engage with the Board and County staff, Respondents failed to provide notice sufficient to
6 inforn the public of their consideration of the Project. The County published the BIR, over 1,000
pages and over 20 exhibits, only ten (10) days prior to their public hearing and only on its website.
This is insufficient notice to allow meaningful review of the document and public participation,
The truncated public notice prevented informed decision-making and left Respondents without the
10 benefit of hearing from the public.
11 103. The County also failed to adequately provide or disclose the draft EIR on its
12  website, impeding public review and consideration of the Project. (Pub. Resources Code, §
13 21152.)

14 104. Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA's noticing requirements represents a
15 failure to proceed in a manner according to law. Accordingly, the Project approval should be set
16 aside.

17 SIXTH CAUSE OF ACTION

18 Violation of CEQA - Failure to Meet Responsible Agency Requirements
19 (Against Respondent Caltrans)
20 105, Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every paragraph of this
21 Petition as though set forth in full herein.
22 106. CEQA requires lead agency to consult with each responsible agency to a project
23  and include the responsible agency's written response in the EIR. (CEQA Guidelines, $§ 15096(b)
24 and 15381.) CEQA requires a responsible agency to independently determine if the EIR meets the
25 requirements of CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15096(a).)

26 107. Respondent Caltrans manages the State's highway system; any development
27 activity on or near the highway requires Caltrans' discretionary approval. The Project borders State
28 Route 16, a highway managed by Caltrans. 'The Project requires Caltrans' discretionary approval
2007326.8 14465-004 23
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 for development along State Route 16 including, but not limited to, easement rights and
2 development permits. Because Caltrans will exercise discretionary approval over the Project, or
any portion thereof, Caltrans is a "responsible agency" pursuant to CBQA for the Project and
required to comply with CEQA's substantive and procedural requirements prior to approving the
Project, or any portion thereof.

108. The EIR fails to' include a written response to the EIR from Respondent Caltrans.
109. The EIR fails to include information showing that Respondent County adequately
8 consulted with Respondent Caltrans, if at all.

110. Respondent Caltrans failed to make an independent determination, or any
10 determination at all, that the Project and EIR meet the requirements of CEQA.

11 111. Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA's mandates applicable to responsible
12 agencies and their participation in the review process represents a failure to proceed in a manner
13  according to law. Accordingly, the Project approval should be set aside.
14 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION

15 For Injunctive Relief
16 (Against All Respondents)

17 112. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every paragraph of this
18 Petition as though set forth in full herein.

19 113. The Project permitted by Respondent Board's Ootober 6, 2020 approval adversely
20 and significantly affects, and will continue to affect, the environment and interfere with the public,
21  including Petitioner's, use and enjoyment of an environment free of the significant environmental
22 impacts from the Project.

23 114. The initiation of and development of the Project is an unpermitted and
24 impermissible project, which adversely impacts Petitioner and the community.
25 115. For each of these reasons, Petitioner lacks an adequate remedy if Respondents are
26 allowed to proceed with the Project prior to such time as this Court determines whether the
27 Respondent Board's actions to certify the EIR and approve the Project were lawful.
28

2007326.8 14465-004 24
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

116. Petitioner seeks an injunction prohibiting Respondents and Real Party in Interest
from proceeding with any aspect of the Project pending determination on the merits of this case.

3 PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, Petitioner Amador County Transportation Commission respectfully
5 requests the following relief and entry of judgment as follows:
1. A peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to vacate and set aside the
approval of the Project and certification of the EIR, and to suspend any and all Project-related
8 activity or activities that could result in a changé or alteration to the physical environment unless
and until Respondents have taken any and all actions that may be necessary to bring Respondents'
10 determinations, findings, and decisions concerning the Project into compliance with CEQA;
11 2. A temporary restraining order and preliminaty and permanent injunction staying or
12 enjoining Respondents and Real Party in Interest from pursuing any actions or activities in
13 furtherance of the Project, pending final adjudiçatión on the merits;
14 3. For actual damages in an amount to be proven at trial;
15 4. An order that Petitioner be awarded the costs incurred in bringing this action, and
16 its attorneys* fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, the "common benefit"
17 theory, Government Code section 800, and as otherwise provided by law or equity; and,
18 5. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.

PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code section 21167.6.5, that on

attached petition for writ of mandate against the County of Sacramento, the Board of Supervisors
of the County of Sacramento, and the State of California, California Department of Transportation
aka Caltrans, (collectively, "Respondents") in the Sacramento County Superior Court. The petition
8 alleges that Respondents violated the California Environmental Quality Act, codified at Public
Resources Code section 21000 et seq. ("CEQA"). The petition further alleges that by certifying a
10 legally-inadequate Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") that failed to comply with CEQA's
11 substantive and procedural mandates, the approval of the NewBridge Specific Plan project (the
12 "Project") should also be overturned because it is based on the defective EIR. The Project will
13 facilitate the development of nearly 1,100 acres in unincorporated, predominantly-undeveloped
14 County area, into a mixed-use development including residential, commercial, recreational, and
15 other uses. A copy of the petition is attached to this notice as Attachment 1.

16 You are receiving this Notice because Respondent County of Sacramento identified your
17 agency as a CEQA "responsible agency" that has jurisdiction over a natural resource affected by
18 the NewBridge Specific Plan project that is the subject of this challenge. A copy of the November
19 20, 2020, correspondence of the County of Sacramento containing the list of responsible agencies

24 INTRODUCTION

25 1. Petitioner and Plaintiff Amador County Transportation Commission ("Petitioner"
26 or "ACTC") brings this Petition for Wiit of Mandate and Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive
27 Relief ("Petition") against Respondents and Defendants the County of Sacramento ("County"), the
28 Board of Supervisors of the County of Sacramento ("Board"), the California Department of
2007326.8 14465-004
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

Transportation ("Caltrans"), and Does 1 through 50, inclusive (collectively, "Respondents") to
2 compel Respondents to rescind their certification of the NewBridge environmental impact report
("EIR") and related approvais ("Project approvals") for failure to follow the mandates of the
California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code sections 21000 et seq. ("CEQA")
and the CEQA Guidelines, California Code of Regulations, Title 14, sections 15000 et seq.
6 ("CEQA Guidelines").

2. The Petition relates to Respondent Board's October 6, 2020 approval of the
8 NewBridge Specific Plan, which will facilitate the development of nearly 1,100 acres in
9 unincorporated, predominantly undeveloped County area into a mixed-use development including
10 residential, commercial, recreational, and other uses ("Project"), and certification of the Project
11 EIR.

12 3. The NewBridge Specific Plan is a "projeot" under CEQA. CEQA requires that a
13 publio agency undertaking a project with the potential to impact the environment must prepare an

14 EIR that uncovers, analyzes, and adopts all feasible measures to mitigate those effects.

15 In approving the Project, Respondents prepared, relied on, and certified an EIR that
16 fails well below CEQA's minimum standards. Construction and operation of the Project would
17 generate significant environmental impacts that are not adequately analyzed in the'EIR and will
18 not be adequately mitigated by Project obligations and thus in violation of CEQA. Respondents
19 failed to fully evaluate and disclose the reasonably foreseeable environmental effects of the
20 Project, failed to support their findings with substantial evidence, failed to recirculate the EIR in
21| light of significant new information, and otherwise failed to comply with CEQA in preparation
22 and certification of the EIR, as alleged below.

23 5. In response to Petitioner's and other community members' multiple comment letters
24 and comments lodged during public hearings regarding the issues identified below, all part of the
25 administrative record in this matter, Respondents cite to the length of the planning process, EIR

26 page count, and 20 plus appendices to support they have met the mandates of CEQA. However,
27| these factors are not dispositive of the EIR's legal sufficiency.

28
2007326,8 14465-004
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

6. Petitioner is informed and believes, and thereon alleges, that the Project will result
2 in significant and adverse impacts to transportation, greenhouse gas emissions, access to

3 emergency services, air quality, and create new safety risks associated with cach. As such, the
4 Project will create significant environmental impacts.

5 7. Given the violations of CEQA, described in greater detail below, Respondents'
6 approval of the Project and certification of the EIR wete done in violation of CEQA. (See Pub.
Resources Code, $§ 21168 and 21168.5 and Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5.) For these reasons,
8 Petitioner respectfully requests that this Court issue a peremptory writ of mandate commanding
9 Respondents to rescind, set aside, and void any and all resplutions or documents related to the
10. Project approval and certification of the EIR, as well as any other legislative, quasi-adjudicatory,
11 or other discretionary or ministerial approvals of the Project or any portion thereof, and grant
12 Petitioners injunctive relief unless and until Respondents comply with CEQA's mandates.
13 PARTIES

14 8. Petitioner Amador County Transportation Commission is, and at all times relevant
15 herein, a State-designated regional transportation planning agency, formed pursuant to
16 Government Code sections 14522, et seq., and the local transportation commission to the County
17 of Amador. Petitioner's service ared is all of Amador County, which neighbors Sacramento County
18 to the west, connected by State Route 16/Jackson Highway ("State Route 16"). Petitioner's mission
19 includes the protection and advancement of local, regional, and intrastate travel for the benefit of
20 Amador County residents, workers, business people, and visitors.

21 9. Respondent County of Sacramento is, and at all times relevant herein was, a
22 political subdivision of the State of California, and is a "local agency" as defined in section 54951
23 of the Government Code. The County also functions as a lead agency under CEQA. In this
24 capacity, the County is charged with evaluating the potential environmental impacts of the Project,
25 identifying Project alternatives and mitigation measures, and otherwise complying with the
26 substantive and procedural requirements of CBQA. Respondent Board of Supervisors of the
27 County of Sacramento is, and at all times releyant hcrein was, the decision-making body for
28 Respondent County,
2007326.8 14465-004 3
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

10. Respondent Caltrans is an executive department of the State of California,
headquartered in Sacramento, California, and manages the State's highway system; Caltrans is the

3 owner-operator of State Route 16. State Route 16 forms the southern border of the Project and any
development activity on or near the highway requires Caltrans' discretionary approval. Approvals
5 from Caltrans required by the Project will include, but not be limited to, easement rights and
6 development permits on and around State Route 16. Caltrans is therefore a "responsible'agency"
for the Project under CEQA and required to comply with CEQA's substantive and procedural
8 requirements prior to approving the Project, or any portion thereof. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15381.)
11. Petitioner does not know the true names or capacities, whether individual,
10 corporate; associate or otherwise, of Respondents Does 1 through 50, inclusive, and therefore sue

... ...- 11 said Respondents under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this Petition to reflect their true
12 namnes and capacities at such time that they become known.
13 12. Real Party in Interest East Sacramento Ranch, LLC is listed as the applicant for the
14 Project on filings with the State Clearinghouse and represented itself as the Project applicant
15 during public hearings and through communications during the pendency of the Project.

16 13. Petitioner is currently unaware of the true names or capacities, whether individual,
17 corporate, associate or otherwise, of Real Parties in Interest Roes 1 through 50, inclusive, and
18 therefore sue said Real Parties in Interest under fictitious names. Petitioner will amend this
19 Petition to reflect their true names and capacities at such time that they become known.
20 JURISDICTION AND VENUE

21 14. This Court has jurisdiction over the matters alleged herein pursuant to Code of
22 Civil Procedure sections 394, 395, 401, 1085, 1087, and 1094.5 and Public Resources Code
23 sections 21168 and 21168.5.

24 15, Venue is proper in Sacramento County pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section
25 394(a) as Respondent County is within Sacramento County and pursuant to section 395 as
26 Respondent Caltrans is headquartered and operates in Sacramento County.

PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

STANDING AND EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES
16, Petitioner has standing in this action where Petitioner seeks the enforcement of a
public duty by Respondents County and Board. Respondents County and Board are public entities
with a mandatory duty to comply with CEQA and all other applicable laws when approving the
Project. Petitioner alleges that Respondents County and Board failed to satisfy this duty by
certifying a legally-inadequate EIR that, as explained in more detail below, lacks requisite analysis
and mitigation when approving the Project in reliance on that EIR and is unsupported by
8 substantial evidence in the record.

17. Petitioner has standing in this action where Petitioner seeks the enforcement of a
10 public duty by Respondent Caltrans. Respondent Caltrans is public entity with a mandatory duty
11 to comply with CEQA and all other applicable laws. As described in further detail below,
12 Respondent Caltrans is a responsible agency to the Project and, in that role, has a duty to meet
13 certain procedural and substantive requirements of CEQA prior to approval of the Project.
14 Petitioner alleges that Respondent Caltrans failed to satisfy this duty by not complying with
15 CEQA's requirements prior to Respondent County and Board's certification of a legally-inadequate
16 EIR,

17 18. Petitioner has direct and substantial beneficial interest in Respondents'
18 compliance with their statutory duties under CEQA because Petitioner is the regional
19 transportation planning agency to Amador County, which adjoins Sacramento County via State
20 Route 16, which will be significantly impacted by the Project as approved.
21 19. Petitioner took advantage of numerous opportunities where Petitioner knew
22 Respondents may be present to bring these issues to the attention of Respondents prior to approval
23 of the Project. Petitioner's counsel submitted comment letters each to Respondent County and
24 Respondent Caltrans. Petitioner's counsel also spoke on behalf of Petitioner at Respondent Board's
25 meetings discussing the Project and EIR. on September 1, 2020 and October 6, 2020.

26 20. CEQA further allows a petitioner who objected to a project to allege in a writ
27 petition all deficiencies asserted by others. (Citizens for Clean Energy v. City of Woodland (2014)
28 225 Cal.App.4th 173, 191.) Petitioner, other agencies, interested groups, and individuals submitted
2007326,8 14465-004 5
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE: COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

oral and written comments on the EIR and Project to Respondents, and raised each of the legal
deficiencies asserted in this Petition.

21. Respondents approved the project and certified the Project EIR on October 6, 2020.
This is final agency action.
22. Petitioner performed all conditions precedent to the filing of this Petition, including
serving notice upon Respondents indicating its intent to commence this action, and fully exhausted
any available administrative remedies. In addition to claims raised by Petitioner, various other
parties have raised concerns regarding impacts of the Project. Petitioner incorporates each of these
9 claims, objections, and comments herein. Petitioner does not have a plain, speedy, or adequate
10 remedy in the ordinary course of law. Petitioner authorized its attorney to file this lawsuit on its
11 behalf to assert its substantial beneficial interest in securing Respondents' compliance with the
12 law.

13 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS

14 23, On October 6, 2020, Respondent Board voted to certify the EIR and approve the
15 Project. On October 7, 2020, or soon thereafter, Respondent County posted a Notice of
16 Determination for the certification of the EIR and approval of the Project.

17. 24. The statute of limitations for a CEQA challenge to Respondents' decision to certify
18 the EIR expires 30 days from the filing and posting of the Notice of Determination. (CEQA
19 Guidelines, $§ 15094(g) and 15112(c)(1).) This Petition is timely filed within the statute of
20 limitations.

21 NOTICE OF CEQA ACTION

22 25. On October 28, 2020, Petitioner sent a Notice of Commencement of Action
23 pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.5 via U.S. mail and electronic mail to
24 Respondents thereby notifying Respondents of Petitioner's intent to file this lawsuit, which seeks
25 to set aside Respondents' approval of the Project and certification of the Project EIR. A copy of
26 the Notice of Commencement of Action is attached hereto as Exhibit A.

27 26. Petitioner has complied with the requirements of Public Resources Code section
28 21167.7 and Code of Civil Procedure section 388 by mailing a copy of the Petition to the State

PREPARATION OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

27. Pursuant to Public Resources Code section 21167.6(a), Petitioner requests that
Respondent County prepare the record of administrative proceedings related to this action. A copy
of the Notice of Request to Prepare the Administrative Record of Proceedings is attached hereto as

Exhibit C.

8 CEOA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

28. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public
10 agency decision makers, such as Respondents, to document and consider the environmental
11 implications of their actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the
12 | decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
13 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires
14 governmental authorities, such as Respondents, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects of
15 projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
16 otherwise could result from their actions. CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with
17 significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.

18 29. Where substantial evidence in the record of proceedings before the lead agency
19 supports "fair argument" that one or more significant environmental effects could occur as a
20 result of approval and implementation of a project, CEQA requires preparation of an EIR. The
21 primary function of the EIR is to discuss the important environmental consequences of the project,
22 including cumulative effects, and to provide the agency and the general public with mitigation
23 measures and alternatives to the project that would have less serious environmental consequences.
24 A lead agency is required to consult with responsible agencies in determining whether an EIR
25 shall be prepared.
26 30. It is a prejudicial abuse of discretion for a public agency not to proceed in the
27 mapner required by CEQA, to fail to support its decision with adequate findings, or to fail to
28 support its findings with substantial evidence in the administrative record, (Code of Civ. Proc., L09
2007326.8 14465-004 7
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1094.5; Pub. Resources Code, § 21168.) Substantial evidence includes "facts, reasonable
assumptions predicated upon facts, and expert opinion supported by facts." (Pub. Resources Code,
3 §8 21080(e)(1) and 21082.2.) Abuse of discretion in certifying an EIR may be found if the content
of the EIR does not meet the statutory and regulatory requirements or if the EIR's conclusions are
5 not supported by substantial evidence. (Banning Ranch Conservancy v. City of Newport Beach
6 (2017) 2 Cal.5th 918.)

31.' Under CEQA, lead agencies, such as Respondents County and Board, are required
to prepare a complete and legally adequate EIR prior to approving any discretionary próject that
may have a significant adverse effect on the environment. The EIR must fully disclose and
10 adequately analyzo the project's potentially significant environmental effects. CEQA also requires
11 lead agencies, such as Respondents County and Board, to consider mitigation measures and
12 alternatives to the project, adopt all feasible mitigation measures and/or alternatives, determine
13 whether proposed mitigation measures will be effective in avoiding or substantially lessening the
14 project's significant environmental impacts, and to make adequate findings, including an adequate
15 statement of overriding consideration for those significant environmental impacts deemed
16 unavoidabie. L'ead agencies, such as Respondents, may not avoid the duty to prepare an EIR by
17 segmenting a project into several smaller projects.
18 32. Responsible agencies, such as Respondent Caltrans, are public agencies which
19| propose to carry out or approve a project, for which the lead agency is preparing or has prepared
20| an EIR or negative declaration, (CEQA Guidelines, § 15381.) A responsible agency is to engage
21 in and respond in writing to consultation with the lead agency, comment in writing on the EIR,
22 and independently consider the EIR prepared by the lead agency to the project and "reachf] its
23 own conclusions on whether and how to approve the project involved." (Id. at § 15096(a).)
24 33. When a govemment agency certifies an EIR, it must exercise its independent
25  judgment and analysis.

26 STATEMENT OF FACTS

27 34. The Project is to build a mixed-use development, including residential, commercial,
28 recreational and other uses, on 1,095 acres of unincorporated and predominantly undeveloped
2007326.8 14465-004 8
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 County land along State Route 16, also known as Jackson Highway. The Project includes about
2 3,000 residential dwelling units of varying density, about 500,000 gquare feet of
3 commercial/office use space, and over 500 acres of open space and park uses. The EIR concludes
4 the Project will create significant and unavoidable impacts to aesthetics, agricultural resources, air
5 quality, biological resources, climate change, hydrology, noise, and traffic and circulation.
35. Real Parties in Interest initiated the Project in February 7, 2012, by filing a project
application withi the County,

36. On January 8, 2013, the County filed a Notice of Preparation of a Draft
9 Environmental Impact Report for the Project.

10 37. On July 27, 2018, the County published the Draft Environmental Impact Report
11 ("draft EIR") and opened public comment for a 45-day review period.

12 38. On August 7, 2018, the Vineyard Community Planning Advisory Council
13 ("Vineyard CPAC") held a public hearing for the Project, After receiving public comments, the
14 Vineyard CPAC voted to recommend denial of the Project due to transportation and traffic
15 'concerns.

16 39, On August 16, 2018, Cordova Community Planning Advisory Commission

17 ("Cordova CPAC") held a public hearing for the Project. After receiving public comments, the
18 Cordova CPAC voted to recommend approval of the Project.

19 40. On September 10, 2018, the Sacramento County Planning Commission held a
20 public hearing on the Project to receive further public comments on the draft EIR. After receiving
21 public comments, the County Planning Commission closed the comment period on the draft EIR

22 and directed staff to prepare the final EIR.
23 41. On December 9, 2019, the County Planning Commission held a public hearing on
24| the Project and voted to recommend approval of the Project,

25 42. In carly August 2020, the County revealed to the public that it would no longer
26 pursue relinquishment of the portion of State Route 16 bordering the Project as previously
27 anticipated in the Project design. The County had sent notice of this decision to Caltrans on
28 November 5, 2019.
2007326.8 14465-004 9
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

43. On August 21, 2020, the County published the final EIR on the County website.
2 44. The final EIR contains numerous, significant changes as compared to the draft EIR,
3 including, but not limited to, addition of considerable analysis and explanation regarding impacts

4 to air quality and climate change, and an additional section more than four pages in length to
5 analyze energy consumption. The EIR also includes reference to a new traffic analysis in response

6 to comments, but fails to incorporate the new traffic analysis into review of Project impacts. The
EIR contains an entirely new appendix evaluating transportation impacts as a measure of Vehicle
Miles Traveled ("VMT). The EIR fails to consider changes in the Project setting since.the traffic

9 and transportation data was collected in 2015. Further, the EIR fails to account for the County's
10 decision to abandon relinquishment of a portion of State Route 16 along the Project border,

11 originally contemplated in conjunction with the Project. Despite this significant new information
•12 and changes to the Project, the County did not recirculate the EIR.

13 45. On August 27, 2020, the County published the Board agenda to its Septémber 1,
14 2020 meeting and listed the Project as an agenda item.

15 46. In the days between the date it published the final EIR, August 21, 2020, and the
16 Board's September 1, 2020 meeting, the County received 14 additional comment letters, including
17  letters from counsel for Real Parties in Intèrest. Petitioner's counsel submitted a comment letter on
18 August 28, 2020, outlining Petitioner's concerns regarding unanalyzed, unmitigated significant
19 traffic impacts, and other violations of CEQA,
20 47. On September 1, 2020, the Board held a public hearing on the Project. Staff
21 presented that, among other things, the Project would include 3,075 residential units of varying
22 density and be consistent with the County of Sacramento General Plan. The number of residential
23 units to be included in the Project is inconsistent throughout the EIR. During the public comment
24 period, Petitioner's counsel spoke on behalf of Petitioner reiterating the points in the August 28,
25 2020 letter and highlighting further deficiencies in the EIR. The Board considered the Project and
26 continued the discussion until its October 6, 2020 meeting.

27 48. On September 22, 2020, Petitioner's counsel submitted an additional comment
28 letter on behalf of Petitioner to the Board, elaborating on points and questions from the September
2007326.8 14465-004 10
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE: COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1, 2020 publie hearing and listing additional deficiencies in the EIR traffic analysis and mitigation

2l measures.

3 49. On October 6, 2020, Petitioner's counsel spoke again at the Board's meeting during
4 public comment on the Project, reiterating Petitioner's points in the September 22, 2020 letter and
5 highlighting further deficiencies in the BIR. County staff responded to Petitioner's comments that
6 "EIRs are not meant to be perfect" and that the public comment on the Project had closed. The
7 Board certified the EIR and approved the Project.
PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE/PUBLIC BENEFIT

50. Petitioner brings this action pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, the
10 private attorney general doctrine, and any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights
11 affecting the public interest.

12 51. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a clear and significant
13| benefit on the citizens of Sacramento and Amador Counties, by requiring Respondents to carry out
14 their duties under CEQA and other applicable laws before approving the Project.

15 52. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a clear and significant
16 benefit on the general public by requiring Respondents to adequately consider, analyze, and
17 mitigate significant impacts to the environment prior to approving the Project, protecting residents
18 and guests to not only the immediate Project vicinity, but also a larger region secondarily
19 tipacted by on-site significant Project impacts.

20 53. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will also result in the enforcement of
21  important rights affecting the public interest by compelling Respondents to engage in a legally
22 adequate analysis of the Project, and to ensure that the public has a meaningful opportunity to

23 review and comment on the impacts and mitigation measures for the Project,
24 54. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement make an award of attorneys'
25 fees appropriate in this case. Without this Petition, Respondents and Real Party in Interest will
26 proceed with a plan and development that will cause significant, unmitigated environmental
27 impacts that might otherwise have been reduced or avoided through legally adequate
28  environmental review and the adoption of feasible mitigation measures. Granting the relief
2007326.8 14465-004 11
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

requested by Petitioner would confer a significant benefit on a large class of people, in that
2 fundamental rules of law would be affected. The cost of pursuing this litigation transcends
Petitioner's personal stake in the matter.
IRREPARABLE HARM

55. Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA, as set forth in this Petition, constitutes
a prejudicial abuse of discretion within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure and CEQA. (See
Code of Civ. Proc., §§ 1085, 1094.5; Pub. Resources Code, $8 21168, 21168.5.)

8 56. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of the
law within the meaning of Code of Civil Procedure section 1086. Unless this Court issues a writ of
10 mandate setting aside Respondents' approval of the Project for failure to conduct adequate
11 environmental review and orders Respondents to comply with the law, the environmental interests
12 of Petitioner and the public that are protected by those laws will be substantially and irreparably
13 harmed. No other legal remedy could adequately compensate Petitioner for the harm to its
14 beneficial interests, and to the environment, occasioned by Respondents' unlawful conduot.
15 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS

16 57. Petitioner is entitled to declaratory relief under Code of Civil Procedure section
17 1060 because an actual controversy exists between Petitioner and Respondents. Petitioner
18 contends that Respondents have acted in violation of applicable laws and must therefore vacate
19 and set aside the Project approval. Petitioner is informed and believes that Respondents dispute
20 this contention. A judicial resolution of this controversy is therefore appropriate and necessary.
21 58. Petitioner is entitled to injunctive relief uhder Code of Civil Procedure section 526
22 because approval of the Project threatens irreparable environmental harm. Unless enjoined,
23 Respondents will implement the Project despite their lack of compliance with CEQA and other
24 applicable laws, causing undue and unnecessary environmental degradation. Petitioner would
25 thereby suffer irreparable harm due to Respondents' failures to take the required steps to evaluate
26 environmental impacts to, among other things, transportation, greenhouse gas emissions, access to
27 emergency services, air quality, and safety risks associated with each. Injunctive relief is thus

28
2007326,8 14465-004 12
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 warranted under Code of Civil Procedure section 525, et seq, and Public Resources Code section
2 21168.9 to prevent irreparable harm to the environment.

3 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

Violation of CEQA -- Failure to Adequately Describe the Project and Project Impacts
(Against Respondents County and Board)
59. CEQA requires an EIR disclose any potentially significant environmental impacts
of the project and inform decision-makers and the general public of mitigation measures and

8 alternatives to the project that would avoid or substantially lessen those impacts.

9 60. The EIR. fails to provide a clear timeline for Project buildout. The EIR states "full
10 buildout of the Project will occur over a span of decades and will be driven by prevailing market
11 conditions in any given year.' This statement lacks any description of the market conditions that
12 may affect the Project or to what degree those conditions may affect the Project. To this point, the
13 EIR fails as an informative document for decision-makers and the public.

14 61. The EIR is inconsistent, and thus inaccurate, in describing the Project and its
15 impacts. For example, the Project description in the EIR provides that the Project will develop
16 2,915 residential units, but elsewhere the EIR. states that the Project will develop 3,075 residential
17 units, a 160 residential unit discrepancy not analyzed.

18 62. Respondents failed to act in a manner required by CEQA with respect to the Project
19 because they failed to adequately address, analyze, or otherwise consider the environmental
20 impacts of the Project. The EIR is conclusory and imprecise by relying on statements including,
21 but not limited to, "the Project is consistent with the General Plan." Respondents are required to
22 support assertions with information and analysis to inform the public. These baseless statements
23 fall below that requirement; accordingly, the EIR is not a sufficient, informative document and
24  Respondents' decisions are unsupported by substantial evidence.

25 63. The EIR fails to adequately consider impacts to transportation and traffic. For
26| instance, the EIR relies on "policies that discourage automobile use" to conclude the "increased
27 use of active transportation modes.as well as increased public transit would result in reductions
28 in [Vehicle Miles Traveled] and energy use." The policies articulated in the EIR, however, do not
2007326.8 14465-004 13
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

support this conclusion. The timing and implementation for the Project's transit system is
2 Il undefined in the EIR, except that it will be complete at full Project buildout, which will be "over a
span of decades." Thus, by the time the transit system is built, impacts from preconstruction,
construction, early residents, and other community members will have already occurred. These
5 impacts are not adequately analyzed or otherwise addressed in the EIR. Any mitigation to be
6 provided by the transit system laoks reasonable definition and certainty. Respondents' conclusion
that policies in the EIR that discourage automobile use will in fact reduce transportation and
energy impacts from the Project is unsupported by information and proper analysis.

64, Respondents failed to apply the proper metric to analyze traffic impacts. A segment
10 |l of State Route 16 borders the Project site and is the responsibility of Respondent Caltrans. As a
11 State highway, the segment is required to be evaluated under the Caltrans performance thresholds
12 for State highways. Respondents failed to apply and analyze Project impacts using this metric in
13 the EIR.

14 65. The EIR fails to adequately measure and inforrh the public on impacts to
15 transportation by providing an unclear position on if the proper metric is Level of Service ("LOS")
16 or Vehicle Miles Traveled ("VMT"). The draft EiR measures impacts to traffic in changes to LOS.
17 Then, the EIR includes as an appendix "NewBridge Specific Plan Revised VMT analysis" which
18 analyzes transportation impacts as a measure of VMT. Further, there is a comment letter from
19 Real Party in Interest's counsel stating that the EIR was not required to use LOS or VMT. The EIR
20 fails to be an internally-consistent, educational document that adequately informs decision-makers
21 and the public on the Project's environmental impacts.

22 66. The EIR fails to analyze secondary impacts from significant impaots to
23 transportation. Secondary impacts include, but are not limited to, increesed first responder
24 response times and decreased fire department access. While the EIR includes some discussion of
25 public services within the Project vicinity, it fails to account for the increased traffic and
26 transportation impacts to public services passing through the Project area to reach the foothills
27 community. After the numerous devastations to entire communities from wildfires and lackof
28 | sufficient access to and from them, this EIR ignores that placing thousands of new commuters in
2007326.B 14465-004 14
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE: COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 the area without widening roads, State Route 16, and/or adding additional streets, existing streets
and highways will be so congested as tó create additional secondary risks to the public's safety and
3 welfare. The EIR fails to include relevant, updated, and complete information related to traffic and
secondary impacts from increased traffic.

67. The EIR fails to analyze and mitigate increased VMT from commuters who will
6 choose to take routes that are longer but less congested, which is a reasonably anticipated result
7 and potentially significant impact from the Project.
8 68. The EIR fails to adequately evaluate cumulative impacts of the Project or address
9 the Project's incremental effects when combined with the effects of past, current, and future
10 projects in the vicinity. (CEQA Guidelines, §§ 15064(h)(1), 15130(a), and 15355.)
11 69. As a result of the foregoing defects, Respondents did not proceed in the manner
12 required by law to prepare an adequate EIR that informed decision-makers and the public of the
13 Project's environmental impacts. Accordingly, the approval of the Project and certification of the
14 EIR must be set aside.

15 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

16 Violation of CEQA - Fallure to Support Findings with Substantial Evidence
17 (Against Respondents Couuty and Board)
18 70. Fetitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every paragraph of this
19 Petition as though set forth in full herein.
20 71. CEQA requires that a public agency make findings supported by substantial
21 evidence. (Pub. Resources Code, $ 21002; CEQA Guidelines, § 15091.)
22 72. Respondents adopted a statement of overriding considerations that stated the
23 Project "will result in significant adverse environmental effects on aesthetics, air quality,
24 biological resources, hydrology and water quality, noise, public utilities, and traffic and circulation
25 that cannot be avoided even with the adoption of all feasible mitigation measures." Respondents
26 failed to support this with substantial evidence, including in the following ways.
27 73. Respondents' finding that the County adopted all feusible mitigation measures to
28 lessen the significant impact to traffic and circulation is not supported by substantial evidence in
2007326.8 14465-004 15
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1  the record. The EIR rejects mitigation measures to transportation impacts "because improvements

2 necessary to improve the LOS to E are not feasible due to environmental, right-of-way, financial
3 and other constrains." There is explanation why the proposed mitigation measure is in fact
4 infonsible, and this conclusory statement does not meet the requirement that findings of 5 infeasibility be justified with substantial evidence.

74. Respondents' finding that the Project is consistent with the County of Sacramento

7 General Plan ("General Plan") is not supported by substantial evidence. CEQA requires an EIR
8 discuss any inconsistencies between a project and the applicable general plan. (CEQA Guidelines,

9 § 15125(d).) The EIR states that the Project is consistent with the General Plan but fails to provide

10 substantial evidence, or any evidence, to support the statement. The General Plan Transportation

11 Policy Plan goals include to "promote a balanced and integrated system to maximize mobility in a
12 safe and efficient manner" and "manage travel on the roadway system and maximize the operating
13 efficiency of transportation facilities in order to reduce impacts on air quality and to minimize the
14 need for new or expanded facilities." However, the EIR contains no independent analysis; rather,
15 in a purely conclusory fashion, it simply states that the Project is consistent with General Plan
16 Policies. This is particularly egregious given the information in the EIR that directly contradicts
17 this conclusion. Furthermore, the Project is inconsistent with these goals because it will create
18 unanalyzed, unmitigated impacts to traffic and transportation.

19 75. The Project is further inconsistent with General Plan policies and programs,
20 including, but not limited to, programs and policies directed at circulation and transportation
21 planning in the following ways;

22 a. The Project fails to incorporate capital costs for transit, as required by CI-
23  27.

24 b. The Project fails to collaborate with transit service providers on phased
25 implementation of transit services, as required by CI-30,

26 C. The Project has no plan or analysis for "intelligent transportation system
27 strategies (ITS) within the County's high-demand travel corridors and support efforts to deploy
28 ITS strategies on a regional level," as required by CI-39.
2007326.8 14465-004 16
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

d. ' The Projéot fails to include any transportation systems management
2 program to manage travel demand associated with the Project, as required by CI-40.

3 e. Respondents failed to "collaborate with other agencies to develop measures .

4 to provide for more efficient traffic flow, reduce vehicular travel demand, and meet air quality
5 goals," as required by CI-42.
76. Respondents were made aware of these deficiencies and failed to provide analysis
7 and explanation on why the findings were sufficient and supported by substantial evidence in the
8 record. In fact, staff's reassurances to the Board of Supervisors was not that the EIR achieved these
9 objectives, but that the EIR need not be perfect. By doing so, Respondents failed to proceed in the
10 manner required by law.

11 77. Respondents failed to adequately respond to comments regarding the sufficiency of
12 the EIR and feasible mitigation measures submitted by Petitioner, other members of the public,
13 and other agencies. Instead, the few responses given to numerous comments regarding the
14 Project's impaots to, among other things, air quality, greenhouse gas emissions, biological
'15 resouirces, and traffic and circulation are conclusory, evasive, confusing, or otherwise non-
16 responsive; contrary to the requirements of CEQA. Comment letters are part of the administrative
17 record and constitute substantial evidence. Respondent County failed to consider or respond to the
18 letters and failed to comply with CEQA.

19 78. Counsel representing Real Party in Interest submitted substantive responses to the
20 Board for consideration prior to certification of the EIR. The responsibility to respond to public
• 21 comments lies with the lead agency. Indeed, any reliance Respondents placed on Real Party in
22 Interest's letters would be misplaced first because the letters include misstatements of law,
23 particularly that the EIR is not required to use VMT or LOS as the metric for impacts to traffic and
24 circulation. Second, the letters include flat, conclusory denials of Petitioner's and other
25 commenters' concerns and provide no clarification on the issues identified and therefore do not
26 raise to the level of "substantial evidence" and do not demonstrate that the government agency
27 exercised independent judgement.

79. Respondents' actions in certifying the EIR and approving the Project, with

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
Violntion of CEQA - Failure to Mitigate Significant Project Impacts
(Against Respondents County and Board)
80. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every paragraph of this
8 Petition as though set forth in full herein.

9 81. CEQA requires a lead agency to impose all feasible mitigation measures that will
10 be effective in avoiding or substantially lessening a project's significant environmental impacts. U

11 (CEQA Guidelines, §8 15370, 15126.4, and 15041.) Mitigation measures must be formulated prior
12 to certification of the EIR and approval of the project; exceptions to this rule are narrow and few.
13| Mitigation measures must be enforceable and contain specific enforcement standards. If a
14 mitigation measure is deemed infeasible, the lead agency must explain why and support that
15 determination with substantial evidence, presented in their findings and a statement of overriding
16 considerations, (CEQA Guidelines, 88 15091 and 15093.)
17 82. Mitigation measures that are rejected as infeasible for financial considerations
18 require a higher level.of analysis and scrutiny. The fact that an altemnative may be more expensive
19 or less profitable is not sufficient to show that the alternative is financially infeasible. What is
20 required is evidence that the additional costs or lost profitability are "sufficiently severe as to
21 render it impractical to proceed with the project." (See Center for Biological Diversity v. County of
22 San Bernardino (2010) 184 Cal.App.4th 1342.)

23 83. Respondents rejected mitigation measures that would reduce significant impacts to
24 traffic "because improvements necessary to improve the LOS to E [level] are not feasible due to
25 environmental, right-of-way, financial, and other constraints." Respondents failed to justify
26 rejecting the mitigation measure to a level of specificity required by CEQA,

27 84. Those mitigation measures that were adopted fail for lack of enforcement
28 mechanism and certainty; for example:
2007326.8 14465-004 18
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

a. Mitigation measure TC-1 is inadequate for failing to include an
enforcement mechanism, failing to identify the party responsible for the implementation, and

3 failing to commit Respondents to an identified course of action.
b. TC-5 expressly admits that the implementation of the mitigation measure is
5 not guaranteed and is also inadequate for failing to include an enforcement mechanism and failing

6 to identify the party responsible for the implementation.

85. Respondent County also committed to mitigating impacts to traffio and
transportation by enacting mitigation measures in the Jackson Cortidor Transportation Mitigation
Strategy on the segment of State Route 16 that borders the Project site. Recently, the County
10  admitted that it will no longer seek relinquishment, and therefore control, of the segment. The.
11 County failed to respond and explain how it intends to implement the Jackson Corridor.
12 Transportation Mitigation Strategy without having any control of the State Route 16 segment.
13 Thus, Respondents failed to justify their findings with substantial evidence.

14 86. Respondents' actions in certifying the EIR and approving the Project premised on
15 inadequate mitigation measures and without adopting all feasible mitigation measures are in
16 violation of CEQA. Accordingly, the Project approval should be set aside and Respondènts should
17 be ordered to recirculate the EIR before proceeding, if at all.

18 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION
19 Violation of CEQA - Failure to Recirculate EIR

20 (Against Respondents County and Board)
21 87. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference cach and every paragraph of this
22 Petition as though set forth in full herein.

23 88. CEQA requires the recirculation of an EIR when "significant new information" is
24  added to the EIR after public notice is given of the draft EIR, and before certification. (Pub,
25 Resources Code, § 21092.1; CEQA Guidelines, § 15088.5.) "'Information' can include changes in
26 the project or environmental setting as well as additional data or other-information." (Id, at §
27 15088.5(a).)

28
2007326.8 14465-004 19
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE: COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 89. The draft EIR relied on data collected from September 2015. In the half-decade
2 since that time, the Project site and vicinity have evolved significantly in natural ways, including
3  but not limited to, climate change, wildfires, and drought, and in unnatural ways, including from
development as the Sacramento region's population grows and traffio, housing demands, and
5 commercial development grow in consequence. The environmental setting for the Project has
6 significantly changed and the EIR. should be recirculated prior to certification.

90. When public notice of the draft EIR was published, the County was pursuing the
8 relinquishment of a portion of State Route 16 in conjunction with its long-term planning for the
9 area; improvements to the segment are proposed through the Jackson Corridor Transportation
10 Mitigation Strategy, incorporated in the EIR, and required in the Transportation Impact Report for
11 the Project. These improvements were premised on relinquishment of State Route 16.
*
12 Approximately one month before the County's mecting to discuss the Project and EIR, County
13 staff announced that the County would not proceed with relinquishment of the segment of State
14 Route 16, therefore it would remain a Caltrans facility for the foresecable future and subject to
15 Caltrans' control, rather than the County's control. This is a significant change in the Project and
16 merits recirculation.

17 91. The traffic analysis in the EIR is based on 2015 data. Respondents, however, relied
18 on a 2018 traffic analysis in order to respond to public comments. Submitted comments asked
19  Respondents to incorporate cumulative traffic analyses that were available in 2018 at the time that
20 the draft EIR was published and were actually incorporated into the Mather South Project and the
21| West Jackson Project. In fact, Respondents acknowledged that the 2018 data was available at the
22 time the draft EIR was published and referenced and relied on it in order to respond to comments.
23 | At'the same time, Respondents improperly refused to provide adequate and appropriate updates to
24 the EIR and recirculate it for review. The inclusion and reliance on the 2018 traffic analysis is
25 significant additional data and analysis meriting an appropriate update and recirculation of the
26 EIR.

27 92. Respondents added substantial new information to the EIR by incorporating a new
28 appendix titled "'NewBridge Specific Plan Revised VMT Analysis," which included eight pages of
2007326.8 14465-004 20
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE: COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

novel analysis and conclusions on the Project's potential impacts to transportation. Specifically,
2 the appendix applied the novel metric "Vehicle Miles Traveled" to residential, office, and retail
3 components of the Project. The memorandum also includes a new table of analysis. The volume of
4 highly-technical information, even regardless of the appendix's conclusions, raises to the level of
5 significant new information that merits recirculation. Notably, the appendix is dated August 4,
6 2020, less than a month before Respondent Board's hearing on the Project and EIR. Indeed, it is
7 unlikely that the Board had time to adequately consider the new information, much less the public
8 had time to adequately read and comment on it.
93. Respondents substantially revised the Air Quality and Climate Change sections to
10 the EIR, adding considerable analysis and explanation. While Petitioner has issue with the
11 inconsistencies and deficiencies in the new information, Petitioner also posits that this is
12 significant new data and analysis meriting recirculation:
13 94. Respondents added a new analysis section in the EIR that is more than four pages
14 in length in order to analyze energy consumption associated with the Project. This is significant
15 new information meriting recirculation.
16 95. Respondents have added significant new information to the EIR and changed the
17 Project, and failed to recirculate the EIR. Respondents have failed to proceed in' a manner required
18 by CEQA and applicable law. Accordingly, the Project approval should be set aside and
19 Respondents should be ordered to recirculate the EIR before proceeding, if at all.
20 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

21 Violation of CEQA - Procedural Violations of CEQA

22 (Against Respondents County and Board)

23 96. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every paragraph of this
24 Petition as though set forth in full herein.

25 97. CEQA requires a lead agency to consult with affected transportation agencies. (See
26 CEQA Guidelines 15086(a)(5).)

27 98. ACTC is a transportation agency to the County directly neighboring the Project site
28 and will be affected by the Project. Respondents failed to consult with ACTC, even after being
2007326.8 14465-004 21
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

made aware of ACTC's concerns with the Project and the Project's impacts on ACTC's interests.

2 Respondents also failed to provide ACTC any notice of the Project at any time during the review
3 process. Respondents' failure to consult with ACTC, or provide any notice to the transportation
agency at all, prevented informed decision-making as it left Respondents without the benefit of
5 hearing from informed parties on the potentially significant impacts of the Project. Further,
6 Respondents failed to comply with the procedural requirements of CEQA.
7 99, CEQA requires that the public be allowed to participate in the review and
8 consideration of proposed projects in an effort to ensure that environmental considerations play a
significant role in government decision-making.

10 100. Respondents failed, to provide adequate opportunity for the public to provide
11| comments on the Project and EIR. Public meetings regarding the Board's certification of the EIR
12 and approval of the Project have taken place exclusively during the COVID-19 global pandemic
13 and been restricted, in part, by the Board's COVID-19 procedures. Under these procedures, in
14 order to give an oral comment, commenters were required to stop listening to portions of the
15 meeting, including the Board's deliberations on the Project and EIR, and wait on a phone line until
16 "admitted" to the meeting by the Board clerk. Comments that were able to be given at Board
17 meetings lagged. Further, comments were interrupted or wholly cut off. Respondents were
18 deprived of the entirety of the public. comments on the Project and the opportunity to make an
19 informed, and therefore legally-adequate, decision, Instead, Respondents' actions demonstrate a
20 focus on concluding public comment posthaste to streamline the Project's approval.
21 101. Respondents further failed to provide sufficient opportunities for the public to
22 comment on the Project and EIR by neglecting to follow their own procedures related to timed
23 agenda items. The Project and EIR were timed agenda items for both Board meetings. Despite
24 this, the Board did not hear the matter until multiple hours after the assigned start time. Interested
25 members of the public, including ACTC Board members, were deprived of the opportunity to
26 comment because the County Board did not offer the opportunity to give public comment within
27 any reasonable time of the timed agenda item..
28

2007326,8 14465-004 22
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

102. For legally adequate public participation to occur, the public must also be afforded
2 notice prior to decisions being made. Respondents failed to provide notice adequate to ensure the
3 public is informed of their consideration of the Project. During a global pandemic limiting the
public's access to in-person meetings, planning sessions, County resources, and other opportunities

5 to engage with the Board and County staff, Respondents failed to provide notice sufficient to
6 inform the public of their consideration of the Project. The County published the EIR, over 1,000
7 pages and over 20 exhibits, only ten (10) days prior to their public hearing and only on its website.
8 This is insufficient notice to allow meaningful review of the document and public participation.
The truncated public notice prevented informed decision-making and left Respondents without the
10 benefit of hearing from the public.

11 103, The County also failed to adequately provide or disclose the draft EIR on its
12 website, impeding public review and consideration of the Project. (Pub. Resources Code, §
13 21152.)

14 104.. Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA's noticing requirements represents a
15 failure to proceed in a manner according to law. Accordingly, the Project approval should be set
16 aside.

17 SIXTE CAUSE OF ACTION

18 Violation of CEQA - Failure to Meet Responsible Agency Requirements
19 (Against Respondent Caltrans)
20 105, Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every paragraph of this
21 Petition as though set forth in full herein,
22 106. CEQA requires lead agency to consult with each responsible agency to a project
23 and include the responsible agency's written response in the EIR. (CEQA Guidelines, $§ 15096(b)
24| and 15381.) CEQA requires a responsible agency to independently determine if the EIR meets the
25 requirements of CEQA. (CEQA Guidelines, § 15096(a).)

26 107. Respondent Caltrans manages the State's highway system; any development
27 activity on or near the highway requires Caltrans' discretionary approval. The Project borders State
28 Route 16, a highway managed by Caltrans. The Project requires Caltrans' discretionary approval
2007326.8 14465-004 23
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR
DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

1 for development along State Route 16-including, but not limited to, easement rights and
2 development permits. Because Caltrans will exercise discretionary approval over the Project, or
3 any portion thereof, Caltrans is a "responsible agency" pursuant to CEQA for the Project and
A required to comply with CEQA's substantive and procedural requirements prior to approving the
5 Project, or any portion thereof.
108. The EIR fails to include a written response to the EIR from Respondent Caltrans.
109. The EIR fails to include information showing that Respondent County adequately
8 consulted with Respondent Caltrans, if at all.
110. Respondent Caltrans failed to make an independent determination, or any
10 determination at all, that the Project and EIR meet the requirements of CEQA.

11 111. Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA's mandates applicable to responsible
12 agencies and their participation in the review process represents a failure to proceed in a manner
13 according to law. Accordingly, the Project approval should be set aside.
14 SEVENTH CAUSE OF ACTION
15 For Injunctive Relief
16 (Against All Respondents)
17 112. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every paragraph of this ..-
18 Petition as though set forth in full herein.

19 113. The Project permitted by Respondent Board's October 6, 2020 approval adversely
20 and significantly affects, and will continue to affect, the environment and interfere with the public,
21 including Petitioner's, use and enjoyment of an environment free of the significant environmental
22 impacts from the Project.

23 114. The initiation of and development of the Project is an unpermitted and
24 impermissible project, which adversely impacts Petitioner and the community.
25 115. For each of these reasons, Petitioner lacks an adequate remedy if Respondents are
26 allowed to proceed with the Project prior to such time as this Court determines whether the
27 Respondent Board's actions to certify the EIR and approve the Project were lawful.
28

2007326.8 14465-004 24
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

116. Petitioner seeks an injunction prohibiting Respondents and Real Party in Interest
•2 from proceeding with any aspect of the Project pending determination on the merits of this case.

3 PRAYER FOR RELIEE
WHEREFORE, Petitioner Amador County Transportation Commission respectfully
5 requests the following relief and entry of judgment as föllows:

1. A peremptory writ of mandate directing Respondents to vacate and set aside the
approval of the Project and certification of the EIR, and to suspend any and all Project-related
8 activity or activities that could result in a change or alteration to the physical environment unless
9 and until Respondents have taken any and all actions that may be necessary to bring Respondents'
10 determinations, findings, and decisions concerning the Project into compliance with CEQA;
11 2. A temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunction staying or
12 enjoining Respondents and Real Party in Interest from pursuing any actions or activities in
13 furtherance of the Froject, pending final adjudiçation on the merits;
For actual damages in an amount to be proven at trial; $ 14 3.

15 4. An order that Petitioner be awarded the costs incurred in bringing this action, and
16 its attorneys* fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, the "common benefit"
17 theory, Government Code section 800, and as otherwise provided by law or equity; and,
18 5. Such other and further relief as the Court deems just and equitable.
