Re: City of Hesperia v Lake Arrowhead Community Services District, et al

To Whom it May Concern:
Our office filed the attached documents on September 1, 2020, in San Bernardino Superior Court as counsel for the City of Hesperia. As you know, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused delays throughout California's court system. As a result, we do not have a case number, and a court clerk told our office the clerks are still processing filings from early August. Because the pleading includes a CEQA cause of action, we are doing our best to comply with the requirement of Public Resource Code section 21167.6 to serve the pleadings within 10 days of filing. Once we have received the conformed documents from the court, a conformed set of all documents will be
served.

Sincerely,

ALESHIRE & WYNDER, LLP

generation project to be located on land outside the District's service area, and within the
2 Petitioner/Plaintiff, City of Hesperia's ("City") jurisdiction, from the City's land use regulations. This
3 Petition/Complaint also challenges the District's reliance on the Renewable Energy Self Generation
Bill Credit Transfer ("RES-BCT") program (Public Utilities Code section 2830) for the project,

5 because the solar power project would be located outside the District's geographic boundaries.
6 | Further, this Petition/Complaint seeks to compel the District and its Board of Directors to fully
7 analyze alternatives to siting their solar power project within the City and further analyze the
environmental impacts of the proposed project, because it would be located in a flood inundation

zone,

10 2. The District owns a 350-acre parcel of land in the City and uses this property to support

11 its wastewater operations. Specifically, the property is used for the recharge of treated effluent back
2 THIHSITY ITIHAONAA 12 into the Mojave River groundwater basin. The property is 13 miles from the District's service area,
BNEYS 13 approximately two miles downstream of the Mojave Forks Dam, and is located adjacent to the west
14 bank of the Mojave River.

15 3. On the southern portion of this property, 660 feet north of the southern property line,
16 the District intends to install solar panels for the generation of up to 0.96 megawatt (MW) of
17  electricity on this property (the "Solar Farm Project").

18 4. District's Board of Directors (*Board") adopted a resolution making findings pursuant
19 to Government Code Section 53096 that there is no feasible alternative to the Project location and, on
20 that basis, purporting to exempt the Solar Farm Project from the City's land use regulations, but these
21  findings are not supported by substantial evidence.

22 PARTIES

23 5. Petitioner/Plaintiff, CITY OF HESPERIA ("City" or "Petitioner"), is a municipal
24 corporation duly organized and validly existing under the laws of the State of California.

FACTS 23

24 Hesperia Zoning Ordinance Provisions Regarding Solar Farms and Solar Systems

25 12. In 2010, the City adopted an ordinance regulating the use of wind and solar technology
26 in homes, businesses and industry.

27 13. With respect to solar farms, Hesperia Municipal Code § 16.16.063 - Alternative energy
28 technology standards subsection B, in relevant part states:
-3-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE: COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
010710003/660544 4 NPI

- B.... Solar farms shall only be allowed on nonresidential and nonagricultural designated

2 properties with approval of a conditional use permit by the planning commission. Solar farms shall not be permitied within six hundred sixty (660) feet of a railway spur, any intersiale,
4a highway, or major arterial, arterial, or secondary arterial roadway; or any agricultural or residentially designaled properly.
4 1. In addition to those items required to be submilted with an application for a conditional use
5 permit as provided in the code, the applicant shall submit the following with its application:

a. A proposed service plan for the city and sphere area to justify the location, design and 6 height of any proposed facility;

7 b. Prior to issuance of a building permit, the applicant shall obtain all necessary approvals for the facility from Southern California Edison, the California Public Utilities
8 Commission, or other governmental agency having jurisdiction over the facility and that
9 the proposal is consistent with such approvals;

C. A statement of the term during which the facility will be put to use and a bond or
10 irrevocable letter of credit in an amount to cover the reasonable cost of removing the

14 2. In the event a facility is abandoned, the holder of the conditional use permit for the facility
15 shall remove the facility at its sole cost and expense. A facility shall be considered abandoned if it ceases to be used as allowed in the conditional use permit for more than one
16 hundred eighty (180) consecutive days." (emphasis added.)

17 A copy of Hesperia Municipal Code § 16.16.063 is attached as Exbibit A.

18 District's Solar Farm Project

19 14. The District's property is 350 acres within the City of Hesperia located at 6727
20 Arrowhead Lake Road. The District's land is designated Rural Residential 0-0.4 units per acre under

21 the land use element of the City's General Plan and is zoned Rural Residential. Uses permitted in
22 Rural Residential include one single family dwelling unit per 2.5 acre lot as well as accessory
23 | buildings and structures, equestrian and large animal uses. And under Rural Residential Special
24 Development a comprehensive plan in the Summit Valley sphere of influence is required.

25 15. On June 10, 2014, the District's Board of Directors created a Solar Power Alternatives
26 Ad Hoc Committee ("Committee"), and on June 16, 2014, the Committee considered presentations
27 from three solar vendors - HelioPower, Martifer Solar, and SunPower.
28 |///

-4-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE: COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
01071.0003/660544.4 NPD

f 16. During the Committee's discussions it was noted the six-acre project was just the
2 beginning. SunPower stated it could build "a project three, four or five times as large, at least 35 to 40

3 acres", and was "looking at kind of the bigger picture. They normally wouldn't even consider [the

4 District]. But because of the Hesperia site, they're considering what could be put down there on behalf

5 of other entities on that site. So we are aware that they would like to use that site for other projects we

6 benefit."

7 17. The District circulated an Initial udy/ Mitigated Negative Declaration (IS/MND) for
8 public review between April 22, 2015 and May 22, 2015.

18. On July 28, 2015, the District received approval from the US Department of the

10 Treasury to issue New Clean Renewable Energy Bonds in connection with the funding of the project.

11 19. On August 27, 2015, the District entered into a Generator Interconnection Agreement
ITIHAINAA Y adIHsaT* 12 for the project with Edison.

13 20. On October 27, 2015, the District's Board approved the award of an Energy Services
14  Agreement to SunPower. Pursuant to that agreement, SunPower would design, construct, and install a
15 |939.6 kV-dc Single-axis tracking solar photovoltaic generation system at the project site.

16 21. On December 15, 2015, the Board adopted Resolution No. 2015-14 in which the Board
17 approved the IS/MND and made the following findings related to the project being exempt from
18 Hesperia zoning ordinances:

19 2. The Board finds and determines that the Project constitutes facilities for the
generation of electrical energy, and therefore meets the criteria for exemption from (1) 20 City of Hesperia building ordinances under Government Code section 53091,
21 subdivision (d), and (2) City of Hesperia zoning ordinances under Government Code section 53091, subdivision (e).
22
3. The Board finds and determines that for over a year the District's Solar Power
23 Alternatives Ad Hoc Committee and SunPower met on numerous occasions and, with District staff, thoroughly reviewed and analyzed all potential locations for the Project. 24 The District does not own any other property that has the acreage and necessary
25 components for a successful solar project due to terrain, trees, and weather conditions. Further, in order to comply with the City's solar ordinance, the District would have to
26 redesign and relocate the Project away from the nearest residentially designated property, which would include the installation of additional AC conductor between the 27 solar array and the Point of Interconnection. This would result in a significant cost

28 increase, measurable power loss, and project delay.

-5-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
01071.0003/660544 4 NPD

4. Thus, the Board finds it is not feasible to install the solar photovoltaic system at any other locations other than the proposed location identified in Exhibit"A", attached 2 hereto and incorporated herein.
3 Based on the above-findings, the Board finds and determines that pursuant to
4 Government Code section 53096, there is no feasible alternative to the location of the 5.

Project at the Hesperia Farms site, by four-fifths vote of the Board, City of Hesperia
5 zoning ordinances, including but not limited to, City of Hesperia Ordinance No. 2012- 07, are rendered inapplicable to the Project. 6

7 22. The City is informed and believes that, in January 2016 the District entered into an
8 agreement with Stifel for placement agent services in connection with the District's anticipated $3.4

9 million New Clean Renewable Energy Bonds. Based on the terms of the agreement it expired on
10 December 31, 2016, and City is uncertain as to whether the agreement was extended.

I 1 Petitioner's 2016 Challenge to District's Solar Farm Project
HIONA 12 23. On February 10, 2016, the City filed its Petition for Writ of Mandate; Complaint for HUIHSIT 13 Declaratory and Injunctive Relief, challenging the District's authority to undertake the project, or in
14 the alternative, requiring the District to comply with the City's general plan and zoning code. City of
15 Hesperia v. Lake Arrowhead Community Services District, San Bernardino Superior Court Case No.
16 CIVDS1602107. The first cause of action challenged the District's authority to undertake the project,
17| because the District is only authorized to provide water and wastewater services within its jurisdiction,
18 and providing electricity gocs beyond the scope of services LAFCO authorized the District to provide.
19 The second cause of action challenged the District's assertion that it was exempt from the City's
20 Il zoning ordinance based on the exceptions in Government Code sections 53091(e) and 53096. The
21 third cause of action was for declaratory relief, relating to the above controversy.

22 24. Government Code section 53096 provides:

23 (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, the governing board of a local
agency, by vote of four-fifths of its members, may render a city or county zoning 24 a ordinance inapplicable to a proposed use of property if the local agency at a noticed

25 public hearing determines by resolution that there is no fcasible alternative to its proposal. The governing board may not render a zoning ordinance inapplicable to a proposed use of property when the proposed use of the property by the local agency is for facilities not related to storage or transmission of water or electrical energy, 26

27 including, but not limited to, warehouses, administrative buildings or automotive storage and repair buildings. The governing board of a local agency may 28 make these determinations at the time it approves an environmental impact report on

2 its proposal required by Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the Public Resources Code. Mailed notice of the public hearing shall be provided at least 10 days

3 prior to the hearing, to the owners of all property within 300 feet of the location of the proposed facility a and a notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place at the proposed

4 site of the facility. If mailed notice as required above would result in notice to more

5 than 250 persons, as an alternative to mailed notice, notice may be given by placing a display advertisement of at least one-fourth page in a newspaper of general circulation

6 within the area affected by the proposed facility and by posting the notice in a conspicuous place at the proposed site of the facility.

7 (b) The board shall, within 10 days, notify the city or county, whose zoning ordinance has been rendered inapplicable under subdivision (a), of its action. If the governing board has taken this action, the city or county may commence an action in the superior court of the county whose zoning ordinance is involved or in which is situated the city

10 whose zoning ordinance is involved, seeking a review of the action of the governing board to determine whether it was supported by substantial evidence. The evidence

11 before the court shall include the record of the procecdings before the city, county, and

WYNDERLP Y TIIHSATY district. The city or county a shall cause a copy of the complaint to be served on the

12 board. If the court determines that the action was not supported by substantial evidence, it shall declare it to be of no force and effect, and the zoning ordinance in
TORNSYS 13 question shall be applicable to the use of the property by the local agency.

14 (c) "Feasible" as used in this section means capable of being accomplished in a

15 successful manner within a reasonable period of time, taking into account economic,
environmental, social, and technological factors.

16 25. The trial court denied the petition for writ of mandate on the first cause of action
17 alleging the project was outside the scope of the District's authority and dismissed the third cause of
18 action for declaratory relief. However, the trial court granted the writ with respect to the second cause
19 of action, finding "it is not demonstrated the exceptions of Government Code sections 53091,
20 subdivision (e), and 53096 apply. In addition, even if section 53096 applied, substantial evidence does
21 not support the District's finding that compliance with the zoning ordinance is not feasible. Therefore,
22 the zoning ordinances applicable to solar farms apply to this project."
23

24 2017 District's Application for a General Plan Amendment and CUP Submitted to the City.

25 26. District appealed from the trial court judgment in favor of the City. After the District

26 filed its appeal, the parties agreed to stay the proceedings while the District sought approval from the

27 City for its Solar Farm Project.

28

-7-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
01071.0003/660544 4 NPD

27. District applied for: Gencral Plan Amendment GPAI7-00001 to change the land use
2 designation of its 350-acre property from Rural Residential with a minimum lot size of 2.5 acres (RR-
3 2 1/2) to Public (P-GOVT) in conjunction with Conditional Use Permit CUP17-00008 to construct a

4 solar farm on 4.7 gross acres located on the east side of Arrowhead Lake Road, south of Hesperia

5 Lake Park.

28. To comply with City zoning requirements, the project was moved 660 feet to the north

7 relative to its originally planned location analyzed in the IS/MND. Because the District believed the
8 impacts at the new location were similar, the District prepared an Addendum to the IS/MND and
submitted it to the City in support of the District's applications.

10 29. On January 16, 2018, City Council denied the District's applications. On March 20,

11 2018, the City Council adopted Resolution No. 2018-09, denying the general plan amendment V mHsaT nHaaNAN 12 application. The City Council made the following findings:

13 (a) The proposed land use within the proposed General Plan Amendment is inconsistent with the goals and policies of the General Plan. The amendment would change a large 14 parcel of land from Rural Residential (RR-2 ½) to Public Government (P-GOVT) in
15 order to allow a public agency a project that does not serve the community of Hesperia.

16 (b) The proposed use, and the uses allowed in the P-GOVT zone in general, would have a substantial adverse effect on abutting property. The relationship to and impact on 17 adjacent property is as follows: (I) To the north the property is designated P-

18 PARK/REC, the Public land use designation that supports Hesperia Lake Park. The character of a solar farm, and the uses allowed in the P-GOVT zone in general, conflict
19 with the use of the Park property by diminishing the rural recreational character; (2) To the east, the property is classified for RR (SD) use, which generally provides for 2.5 acre
20 or larger residential lots. The SD (Special Development) designation is intended to ensure that utility/public service, topographic, environmental sensitivity and other 21 developmental constraints are prudently considered. P-GOVT use in general and a solar farm in particular are incongruent with the nature and purpose of RR (SD) land use. (3) 22 To the south, the property is designated for A2 or General Agricultural use. This land use
23 provides areas for commercial agricultural operations, agricultural support services, livestock keeping, rural residential uses, and similar uses. 350 acres of P-GOVT use(s)
24 and a 4.7- acre solar farm in particular are not compatible with the nature of A2 uses.
The property to the east is not within Hesperia.
25

26 (c) The proposed use is not consistent with City policy regarding solar farms, the Géneral Plan and the Development Code. Solar farms are specifically prohibited in Residential
27 and Agricultural zones. The subject property's current RR-2 1/2 land use designation properly reflects the rural/residential/agricultural character of the area. The P-
28 PARK/REC designation to the north complements the existing RR-2 1/2 land use with
-8-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
01071.0003/660544.4 NPD

the park and recreation use limitations. Hence, the P-GOVT designation here would be incompatible with the character of the area and is pursued to place a solar farm use in an in 2 area that specifically violates the prohibition in residential and agricultural areas.
3 (d) The proposed General Plan Amendment is overly broad for the proposed land uses
4 permitted within the proposed Land Use designation. The proposed P-GOVT designation is inappropriate for the entirety of the 350 acre site, because the solar farm, as presently
5 proposed, will occupy only 4.7 acres of the site.

6 (c) The proposed General Plan Amendment is inconsistent with the goals, policies,
7 standards and maps of the adopted General Plan and Zoning Development Code, and all applicable codes and ordinances adopted by the City of Hesperia, including but not
8 limited to General Plan Goal LU-5, because the proposed amendment seeks to designate
land as P-GOVT when the intended use on the land will not serve the needs of the
community for schools, parks, community facilities, open space, utilities, or
infrastructure. 10

11 (f) Even if the P-GOVT designation was proper for the subject property, a solar farm is a
AYT LY S B IHAONAÁ not a permitted use in P-GOVT. YEHIHSITY 12 (g) The property that is the subject of the application is more appropriate, in the City 13 Council's legislative judgment, for the uses permitted in the current RR-2 ½/ designation rather than the uses permitted in the proposed P-GOVT designation. 14

15 A copy of Hesperia Resolution No. 2018-9 is atlached as Exhibit B.

16 30. On March 20, 2018, the City Council adopted Resolution No. 2018-10, denying the
17 conditional use permit application for the District's Solar Farm Project. The City Council made the
18 following findings:

19 (a) The proposed use will have a substantial adverse effect on abutting property for the following reasons: (1) the proposed use is inconsistent with the surrounding uses of 20 public recreational/park and rural residential; (2) the proposed site lacks onsite water or a

21 fire control plan, increasing fire risk for the surrounding neighbors and community; (3) the proposed project lacks street improvements; and (4) the proposed solar farm is
22 unattractive and will blemish the surrounding high desert landscape, and sightlines for the surrounding residential properties, and the nearby recreational facilities.
23
(b) The proposed use is inconsistent with the objectives, policies, general land uses and 24 programs of the General Plan and Development Code. A solar farm is not allowed in a
25 RR-2 ½ designated area. The applicant concurrently sought with its application a General Plan Amendment to change the RR-2 ½ designation to Public Government (P-GOVT).
26 Even if that General Plan Amendment were approved, a 4.7 acre solar farm is not an appropriate use on P-GOVT designated property. Within the General Plan "[t]ables LU-
27 27 through LU-29 detail intensity, intent and allowable uses on property with these public properties and uses, as follows "P-GOVT designation includes city, county, state, 28 and federal properties and uses such as City Hall, ' county, state, and federal
-9-

01071 0003/660544.4 NPD

administrative offices and other facilities, fire stations, police stations, and animal control

2 offices." (Hesperia General Plan, Table LU-28.) A 4.7 acre solar farm is not within the scope of the intended use of P-GOVT designated property.
3 (c) The Proposed use is not a permitted use within a Public designation, because a solar
4 farm is not listed use under Development Code section 16.16.430 (D)(I). Electrical, gas, water and sewage transmission facilities are permitted, but solar farm are not a
5 permitted use on a parcel of land designated for public use.

6 A copy of Hesperia Resolution No. 2018-10 is attached as Exhibit C.
7 31. District did not file a petition for writ of mandate challenging the City's denial of the
General Plan amendment and the denial of the conditional use permit.
9 District's Appeal from the Judgment Results in Affirmance of the Judgment in
10 Favor of the City

11 32. Following the denial of the District's permit applications by the City, the stay of the
3 AHIHSITV VYNDERuP 12 appeal was lifted. On July 19, 2019, the Court of Appeal for the Fourth Appellate District, Division
13 One, affirmed the judgment, holding "District's proposed project includes the transmission of
14 clectrical energy, the exemption contained in section 53091(e) does not apply to the project; and
15 because the administrative record does not contain substantial evidence to support the District's
16 board's finding that there is no feasible alternative to the proposed location of the project, the District
17 prejudicially abused its discretion in determining that the exemption contained in section 53096(a)
18 applied to the project." (Cily of Hesperia V. Lake Arrowhead Community Services Dist. (2019) 37

19 Cal.App.5th 734, 740.)
20 33. The Court of Appeal found there was no substantial evidence in the administrative
21 record demonstrating "there is no feasible alternative" to the solar project, as required under the
22 qualified exemption in Government Code section 53096, subdivision (a).

23 November 2019 The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Changed Mojave River Dam's

24 Risk Characterization From Low to High Urgency of Action.

25 34. On November 1, 2019, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published a news release,
26 stating a recent risk assessment it had conducted found that during an extreme flood event, water
27 could exceed the design capacity of the Mojave River Dam and overtop the dam. This could
28  potentially result in dam failure, flooding the communities of Hesperia, Apple Valley, Victorville and
-}0-

01071.0003/660544 4 NPD

1 Barstow, located adjacent to the Mojave River. Flood waters also could reach Baker, more than 140

2 miles downstream of the dam.

3 35. As sited, the District's Solar Farm is adjacent to the Mojave River and within the flood
4  inundation zone. (See Flood Inundation Map, attached hereto as Exhibit D.)

5 District's 2020 Resolution Finding Other Project Locations Infeasible Pursuant to Government Code Section 53096.
6

7 36. On June 23, 2020, the District's Board held another public hearing regarding the

8 approval of the solar project, sited at the location identified in its applications for the General Plan
9 Amendment and conditional use permit.

10 37. At the conclusion of the public hearing, the District's Board adopted Resolution 2020-

11 04, which provided in relevant part:
D MY1 MHAUNLA AHIHSIT 12 The District, by four-fifths vote of the Board, determines there is no feasible alternative is 13 to the Proposal under Government Code section 53096. The District's determination is
14 based on Alternatives Report, including but not limited to the Tidewater Memorandum
and the Sage Report, and the remaining administrative record for such determination, the
15 District's approval of the Original Site, and the District's approval of the Alternative Site (the Proposal). The District's determination renders inapplicable all City of Hesperia
16 zoning ordinances, including but not limited to, City of Hesperia Ordinance No. 2012-07,
to the Proposal. 17

18 A copy of District's Resolution No. 2020-04 is attached as Exhibit E.

19 38. On July 2, 2020, the District posted its Notice of Determination for the Project.

20 Notice, Jurisdiction, and Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies

21 39. Petitioner has caused a Notice of its intent to file this Petition to be served upon the
22 Respondents as required by Public Resources Code section 21167.5. A true and correct copy of the
23 Notice and proof of service is attached to this Petition as Exhibit F.

24 40. Petitioner seeks review and relief from this Court under Public Resources Code
25 sections 21167, 21168, and/or 21168.5, as applicable; and Code of Civil Procedure sections 1060 et
26 seq., 1084 et seq., and 526a, among other provisions of law. Respondents are threatening to proceed
27 with construction of the Solar Farm Project immediately, as they have made findings there is no
28  feasible alternative to the location of their project and have purported to render the City's land use
-11-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
01071 0003/6605444 NPD

1 regulations inapplicable.

2 41. Petitioner exhausted all administrative remedies as required by law by submitting

3 timely written objections prior to the District Board's June 23, 2020 meeting where the Board
4  determined there is no feasible alternative to the location of their project and purported to render the

5 City's land use regulations inapplicable.

6 42. Respondents' adoption of Resolution No. 2020-04 constitutes a prejudicial abuse of

7 discretion, because Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law and made findings
8 not supported by substantial evidence.

9 43. Petitioner has no plain, speedy, and adequate remedy at law, because the Petitioner will
10 suffer irreparable harm as a result of violations of CEQA and other laws by Respondents, and each of
11 them, the inadequacy of the Addendum No. to the IS/MND, and the absence of substantial evidence
SIHAONAM aasaTY 12 to support the District's decision to exempt the Project from the City's land use regulations.

13 44. Petitioner has a right and interest in Respondents' fulfillment of all of their legal duties
14 and responsibilities, and in enforcing the prohibition of acts that violate the law as alleged in the
15 Petition. Petitioner and the public will be irreparably harmed by the ensuing environmental damage

16 and by the violations of CEQA and state planning and zoning laws by Respondents.
FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 17

18 [Petition for Writ of Mandate - Code of Civil Procedure § 1085]

19 45. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates herein by this reference the allegations of
20 I paragraphs I through 44 above.

21 46. The RES-BCT program, created by Public Utilities Code section 2830, allows local
22 governments and college campuses to generate energy for their own use. Energy that is not used can
23 be exported to an electricity provider's grid. All generation exported to the electricity provider's grid
24 is converted into "generation credits" and is applied to the accounts designated by the local
25 government.

26 47. For purposes of Public Utilities Code section 2830 an "eligible renewable generating
27 facility" must meet all the following requirements:

28 (A) Has a generating capacity of no more than five megawatts.
-12-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE; COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
01071 0003/660544.4 NPD

1

2 (B) 1s an eligible renewable energy resource, as defined in Article 16 (commencing with Section 399.11) of Part 1.

3 (C) Is located within the geographical boundary of the local government or. for a
4 campus, within the geographical boundary of the city or city and county, if the campus is located in an incorporated area, or county, if the campus is located in an
5 unincorporated area.

6 (D) Is owned by, operated by, or on property under the control of the local government
7 or campus.

8 (E) Is sized to offset all or pait of the electrical load of the benefiting account. For these purposes, premises that are leased by a local government or campus are under the control of the local government or campus.

10 48. The Hesperia Farms property is owned and controlled by the District. However, it is
11
IHIANAA Y TamHsaT not located within the geographical boundaries of the District, and the District's generating facility
12 does not meet the requirements of Public Utilities Code section 2830.
13 49. The City challenges the District's use of the RES-BCT program for its Solar Farm
14 Project because it is not located within the "geographical boundary of the local government" for
15 purposes of the requirements of Public Utilities Code section 2830.
16 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION
17 [Petition for Writ of Mandate - Code of Civil Procedure §§1085 and 1094.5]
18 50. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates herein by this reference the allegations of
19 paragraphs 1 through 44 above.
20 51. State CEQA Guidelines section 15162 states in relevant part:
21 (a) When an EIR has been certified or a negative declaration adopted for a project, no
22 subsequent EIR shall be prepared for that project unless the lead agency determines, on the basis of substantial evidence in the light of the whole record, one or more of the
23 following:

24 (3) New information of substantial importance, which was not known and could not
25 have been known with the exercise of reasonable diligence at the time the previous EIR
was certified as complete or the negative declaration was adopted, shows any of the • 1
26 following:
(A) The project will have one or more significant effects not discussed in the
27 previous EIR or negative declaration;
(B) Significant effects previously examined will be substantially more severe 28 than shown in the previous EIR;
-13-
PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE: COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
01071 0003/660544 4 NPD

I (C) Mitigation measures or alternatives previously found not to be feasible would in fact be feasible and would substantially reduce one or more 2 significant effects of the project, but the project proponents decline to adopt the mitigation measure or alternative; or 3 (D) Mitigation measures or alternatives which are considerably different from
4 those analyzed in the previous EIR would substantially reduce one Or more significant effects on the environment, but the project proponents decline to
5 adopt the mitigation measure or alternative.

6

7 52. Allegedly, Respondents analyzed alternative projects to the Solar Farm Project, using
technical, economic, social and environmental factors for comparison purposes. During this time when

9 alternatives were allegedly being analyzed, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released new

10 information of significant importance relating to the increased risk of the Mojave River Dam failing.

11 53. The record does not show the District analyzed this new information or conducted any
S SaNIHSaTY 12 further study of the environmental effects of the Solar Farm Project, even though it is sited next to the

13 Mojave River and within the flood inundation zone.

14 54. Petitioner submitted comments questioning the depth of the District's analysis of

15 alternatives and compliance with CEQA.

16 55. Respondents reliance on an IS/MND from 2015 and an updated addendum originally
17 prepared in 2017 is not sufficient when new information of significant importance to the potential

18 environmental effects of their proposed project has not been analyzed.

19 56. Respondents violated their duties to adequately analyze environmental impacts and

20 mitigate environmental impacts to lessen or eliminate such impacts of the Solar Farm Project to

21 conform to the requirements of CEQA and the CEQA Guidelines. Accordingly, the Board's adoption

22 of Addendum No. to the IS/MND, the Board's determination of no feasible alternative to the Solar

23 Farm Project, and the Board's approval of the Solar Farm Project should be set aside.

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION

2 [Petition for Writ of Mandate - Civil Procedure §51085 and 1094.5]

3 57. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates herein by this reference the allegations of
paragraphs 1 through 44 above.

58. § Government Code § 53091 provides generally that "[e]ach local agency shall comply

6 with all applicable building ordinances and zoning ordinances of the county or city in which the

7 territory of the local agency is situated.3 As used in Government Code § 53091, "local agency" means
8 "an agency of the state for the performance of governmental or proprietary function within limited
9 boundaries." Government Code 53090(a). The District is a local agency within this definition.

10 59. Hesperia's zoning ordinance "make[s] provision" for facilities like District's Solar
11 Farm Project, because Hesperia Municipal Code ("HMC") allows a "solar farm" in nonresidential and
AY1 LY 5 MHAONA ALESHIRE & 12 nonagricultural zones with a Conditional Use Permit ("CUP"). (HMC 16.16.063(B); City of Sania
13 Clara v. Santa Clara Unified School Dist. (1971) 22 Cal. App. 3d 152, 162-163 [under a prior version
14 of Gov. Code § 53091, holding zoning ordinance "make provision" for a use if it provides for location
15 for the use, even if a CUP is required].)

16 60. Government Code § 53096 provides, with regard to storage or transmission facilities
17 for water or electrical energy, a local agency, "by vote of four-fifths of its members, may render a city
18 or county zoning ordinance inapplicable to a proposed use of property if the local agency at a noticed
19 public hearing determines by resolution that there is no feasible alternative to its proposal."

20 61. District made a finding that it was infeasible to site the Solar Farm Project anywhere

21 else. That finding is not supported by substantial evidence.

22 62. The absence of substantial evidence to support the District's findings of infeasibility
23 renders its findings arbitrary and capricious.

24 63. The District has plain, clear and ministerial duty to comply with the City's land use
25 regulations and its decision to exempt itself from compliance with the City's land use regulations is
26 arbitrary and capricious. The City has no plain, speedy and adequate legal remedy. Therefore, the City
27 is entitled to a writ of mandate compelling the District to comply with City's land use regulations.

64. a Further, a temporary restraining order and preliminary and permanent injunctions
2 should issue restraining the District, Edison, SunPower, and Stifel from proceeding with the project
3 unless and until the District complies with the City's zoning ordinances.
FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION 4

[Declaratory Relief] 5

6 65. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates herein by this reference the allegations of
7 paragraphs 1 through 44 above.

8 66. An actual controversy has arisen and exists between the City and Respondents in that
9 the City contends that the Solar Farm Project is not an eligible generating facility under Public
10 Utilities Code section 2830, and substantial evidence does not support the District's infeasibility
11 finding, pursuant to Government Code section 53096, rendering the City's zoning ordinance IHAONAA ANIHSAT 12 inapplicable.

13 67. The City is informed and believes that Respondents contend that the Solar Farm Project
14 is an eligible generating facility, and substantial evidence does support District's infeasibility finding,
15 pursuant to Government Code section 53096.

16 68. The parties at this time desire a judicial declaration of their respective rights and

17 obligations with respect to whether the Solar Farm Project is an eligible generating facility and, if the
18 District's infeasibility finding is supported by substantial evidence.

PRAYER 19

20 WHEREFORE, the City prays for judgment as follows:

and rear property lines. Guy wires may encroach into the minimum setbacks, but shall not encroach over property lines.

a. Windmill(s) may be located up to twenty-five (25) percent closer to the front property line than the primary building
when the primary building is located within the rear twenty-five (25) percent of the lot if approved under a minor
exception application pursuant to Article VI of Chapter 16.12.
b. To allow the setback reduction above, it shall be demonstrated that the windmill(s) meet the minimum noise
requirements within Section 16.16.063(A)(3) and under no circumstances shall a windmill be located within the
minimum front yard setback or a recorded building setback line.
2. The structure may need to be farther from the property lines based upon the required specifications regarding noise
identified in Section 16.16.063(A)(3).
3. Specifications on the noise produced by the windmill shall be submitted for windmills within all zone districts, identifying the
distance from the structure to the property line to meet the city's noise ordinance. The setback shall be increased should the
manufacturers' specifications evidence that the windmill would exceed the evening noise standard at any property line.

4. Tower-mounted windmills shall not exceed the height limitation of the zone district in conjunction with the special height
increases of Section 16.20.060 except for developed properties in residential and agricultural designations as defined below.
The height shall be measured to the top of the blades or rotors or any other portion of the windmill, which extends farthest above ground level. The blades and rotors of the windmill shall be a minimum of fifteen (15) feet above ground level at the
lowest point to ensure the safety of persons and property beneath.
a. The height of windmills on lots less than ninety thousand (90,000) square feet in net area may be equivalent to one-
half the lot width.

d. Windmills on lots five gross acres or larger in area may be up to one hundred twenty (120) feet in height.
e. Approval of additional height beyond the limits described in Section 16.063(A)(4) shall require approval of a variance.
5. Multiple tower-mounted windmills are allowed subject to compliance with the minimum setback and accessory structure lot
coverage limitations as well as in conformance with the noise ordinance. The area of a windmill is defined as the is circular
area measured horizontally at the farthest spread of the rotors/blades of the windmill from the pole in determining
accessory structure lot coverage.
6. Roof-mounted windmills shall not exceed fifty (50) feet or the height regulation of the zone district, whichever is greater.
Approval of a minor exception is needed to exceed the height restriction by up to ten percent and approval of a variance
shall be required to exceed the allowed height beyond ten percent. Roof-mounted windmills do not qualify for the special
height increases of Section 16.20.060. The height shall be measured from the ground to the top of the blade/rotor or any
other portion of the windmill.
7. Specifications on the noise produced by the windmill shall be submitted pursuant to Section 16.16.063(A)(3), identifying the
distance from the structure to the property line necessary to meet the city's noise ordinance. The windmill shall be located
so that it does not exceed the evening noise standard at any property line.
8. All windmills shall be a light gray, white, or other city-approved non-reflective color to minimize visual disruption of the area.
Use of conspicuous colors is prohibited. Windmills shall not contain signs or be illuminated, unless required by state or
federal law.

9. Nothing in this development code amendment shall be construed to affect the structural requirements for any windmill, as
enforced by the building and safety division. All windmills shall require issuance of a building permit prior to installation.
10. All mechanical equipment associated with the windmill located outdoors shall be secured by a minimum five-foot high fence
to prevent unauthorized access. Ladders or step bolts on the side of towers shall be a minimum of nine feet above ground
level or shall be equipped with an approved method to prevent unauthorized access.
11. Windmills shall be equipped with manual and automatic controls to limit the operational speed of the blades/rotor to the
design limits of the windmill. An automatic braking, governing or feathering system shall also be provided to prevent
uncontrolled rotation.
12. No windmili shall cause any electromagnetic interference.
13. Windmills shall be kept in good working order and shall be maintained in an aesthetic state. All windmills which are in a
nonoperational state for one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days or more shall be considered abandoned and shall be

A RESOLUTION OF THE CITY COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF HESPERIA, CALIFORNIA, DENYING GENERAL PLAN AMENDMENT APPLICATION TO
AMEND THE OFFICIAL GENERAL PLAN LAND USE MAP BY
RECLASSIFYING CERTAIN REAL PROPERTY FROM RURAL RESIDENTIAL WITH A MINIMUM LOT SIZE OF 2.5 ACRES (RR-2 1/2) TO PUBLIC (P-GOVT) ON 350 ACRES LOCATED ON THE EAST SIDE OF ARROWHEAD LAKE ROAD, SOUTH OF HESPERIA LAKE PARK (GPA17-00001)
WHEREAS, on May 15, 1991, the City Council of the City of Hesperla adopted the City's General Plan, currently applicable in regards to development within the City; and
WHEREAS, Lake Arrowhead Community Services District (District) filed an application requesting approval of GPA17-00001 described herein (hereinafter referred to as "Application");
and

WHEREAS, the property that is the subject of the Appilcation consists of 350 acres within the General Plan Land Use Designation of Rural Residential with a minimum lot size of 2.5 acres (RR-2 1/2) located on the east side of Arrowhead Lake Road, approximately 4,000 feet south of Hesperia Lake Park, Assessor's Parcel Numbers 0397-013-04, 05, 17 thru 22; and
WHEREAS, the Application, as contemplated, proposes to change the General Plan Land Use designation of the subject property from RR-2 ½/ to Public (P-GOVT); and
WHEREAS, the District also filed an application requesting approval of Conditional Use Permit CUP17-00008 to construct a solar a farm on approximately 4.7 gross acres on the east side of Lake Arrowhead Road, approximately 4,000 feet south of Hesperia Lake Park (APN: 0397-013- 22); and
WHEREAS, the subject site Is vacant and used by the District to percolate effluent treated at its water reclamation facilities in Lake Arrowhead. Hesperia Lake Park is located to the north. Residences and open space uses exist to the south and west of the property which Is currently designated RR-2 ½, and proposed to be changed to P-GOVT. The Mojave River is located to
the east; and
WHEREAS, the land to the south is within the City's Sphere of Influence and is designated General Agricultural (A2) by the Hesperia General Plan. The land to the west is designated Rural Residential (Special Development) [RR(SD)]. The land to the east is outside City limits;
and

WHEREAS, the District performed an initial study and prepared a mitigated negative deciaration (IS & MND) in December 2015 for a solar farm project on the site. To comply with City zoning requirements, the project was moved 660 feet to the north from the location analyzed in the prior IS & MND. Because the impacts of the new location are simllar, an Addendum was prepared and was adopted by the District on August 9, 2017. The City Council has considered the environmental effects of the project as shown in the IS & MND and the Addendum; and
WHEREAS, on November 9, 2017, the Planning Commission of the City of Hesperia conducted a duly noticed public hearing pertaining to the proposed Application, and concluded said hearing

Resolution No. 2018-09
Page on that date. The Planning Commission recommended approval of the General Plan Amendment and Conditional Use Permit; and

WHEREAS, on January 16, 2018, the City Council of the City of Hesperia conducted a duly a noticed public hearing pertaining to the proposed Application, and concluded said hearing on that date; and
WHEREAS, at the January 16, 2018, hearing the City Council voted to deny GPA17-00001.
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CITY OF HESPERIA CITY COUNCIL AS
FOLLOWS:

Section 1. The City Council hereby specifically finds that all of the facts set forth in this in Resolution are true and correct.

Section 2. Based upon substantial evidence presented to the City Councll during the above-referenced January 16, 2018 hearing, Including public testimony and written and oral staff reports, this Council specifically finds as follows:
(a) The proposed land use within the proposed General Plan Amendment is inconsistent with the goals and policies of the General Plan. The amendment would change a large parcel of land
from Rural Residential (RR-2 ½) to Public Government (P-GOVT) in order to allow a public agency a project that does not serve the community of Hesperia.
(b) The proposed use, and the uses allowed in the P-GOVT zone in general, would have a substantial adverse effect on abutting property. The relationship to and impact on adjacent property is as follows: (1) To the north the property is designated P- PARK/REC, the Public land use designation that supports
Hesperia Lake Park. The character a of a solar farm, and the uses allowed in the P-GOVT zone in general, conflict with the use of the Park property by diminishing the rural recreational character; (2) To the east, the property is classified for RR (SD) use, which generatly provides for 2.5 acre or larger residential lots. The SD (Special Development) designation is intended to ensure that utility/public service, topographic, environmental sensitivity and other developmental constraints are prudently considered. P-GOVT use
in general and a solar farm in particular are incongruent with the nature and purpose of RR (SD) land use, (3) To the south, the property is designated for A2 or General Agricultural use. This land use provides areas for commercial agricultural operations, agricultural support services, livestock keeping, rural residential uses, and similar uses. 350 acres of P-GOVT use(s) and a 4.7- acre solar farm in particular are not compatible with the nature of A2 uses. The property to the east is not within Hesperia.
(c) The proposed use is not consistent with City policy regarding solar farms, the General Plan and the Development Code. Solar farms

01071.0005/443838.7

15

Resolution No. 2018-09
Page 3
are specifically prohibited in Residentlal and Agricultural zones, The subject property's current RR-2 1/2 land use designation properly reflects the rural/residential/agricultural character of the area. The P-PARK/REC designation to the north complements the existing RR-2 1/2 land use with the park and recreation use limitations. Hence, the P-GOVT designation here would be incompatible with the character of the area and is pursued to place a solar farm use in an area that specifically violates the prohibition in residential and agricultural areas.
(d) The proposed General Plan Amendment is overly broad for the -*a proposed land uses permitted within the proposed Land Use designation. The proposed P-GOVT designation is inappropriate for the entirety of the 350 acre site, because the solar farm, as
presently proposed, will occupy only 4.7 acres of the site.
(e) The proposed General Plan Amendment is inconsistent with the goals, policies, standards and maps of the adopted General Plan and Zoning Development Code, and all applicable codes and
ordinances adopted by the City of Hesperia, including but not limited to General Plan Goal LU-5, because the proposed
amendment seeks to designate land as P-GOVT when the intended use on the land will not serve the needs of the
community for schools, parks, community facilitles, open space,
utilities, or infrastructure.
(f) Even if the P-GOVT designation was proper for the subject property, a solar farm is not a permitted use in P-GOVT.
(g) The property that is the subject of the application is more appropriate, In the City Council's legislative judgment, for the uses permitted in the current RR-2 ½ designation rather than the uses
permitted in the proposed P-GOVT designation.

Section 3. Based on the findings and conclusions set forth In this Resolution, the City Council hereby DENIES General Plan Amendment GPA17-00001.
Section 4. City Clerk shall certify to the passage and adoption of this Resolution and enter it into the book of original resolutions.
Section 5, The documents and materials that constitute the record of proceedings on which these findings and conclusions are based are located with the City Clerk at the City of Hesperia City Clerk's office at 9700 Seventh Avenue, Hesperia, CA, unless otherwise located within the custody of the General Manager of the Lake Arrowhead
Community Services District, 27307 State Highway 189, Blue Jay, California 92317, related to the District's approval of the project.
Section 6, Any challenge to this Resolution, and the findings set forth therein, must be filed within the 90 day statute of limitations set forth in Code of Civil Procedure Section
1094.6.

WHEREAS, at the conclusion of the public hearing, having considered public testimony, written, and oral staff reports, the City Council voted to deny the proposed application, CUP17-00008.
NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED BY THE CITY OF HESPERIA CITY COUNCIL AS
FOLLOWS:

Section 1. The City Council hereby specifically finds that all of the facts set forth in this
Resolution are true and correct.

Sectlon 2, Based upon substantial evidence presented to the City Council during the above-referenced January 16, 2018 hearing, including publlc testimony and written and oral staff reports, this Council specifically finds as follows:
(a) The proposed use will have a substantial adverse effect on abutting property for the following reasons: (1) the proposed use is inconsistent with the surrounding uses of public recreational/park and rural residential; (2) the proposed site lacks onsite water or a fire control plan, increasing fire risks for the surrounding neighbors and community; (3) the proposed project lacks street improvements; and (4) the proposed solar farm is unattractive and will blemish the surrounding high desert landscape, and sightlines for the surrounding residential properties, and the nearby
recreational facilities.

(b) The proposed use is inconsIstent with the objectives, policies, general land uses and programs of the General Plan and Development Code. A solar farm is not allowed in a RR-2 ½
designated area. The applicant concurrently sought with its application a General Plan Amendment to change the RR-2 ½ designation to Public Government (P-GOVT). Even if that General Plan Amendment were approved, a 4.7 acre solar farm is not an appropriate use on P-GOVT designated property. Within the General Plan "It]ables LU-27 through LU-29 detail intensity, intent, and allowable uses on property with these public designations." Table LU-28 defines public properties and uses, as follows: "P-GOVT designation includes city, county, state, and federal properties and uses such as City Hall, county, state, and federal administrative offices and other facilities, fire stations, police stations, and animal control offices." (Hesperia General Plan, Table LU-28.) A 4.7 acre solar farm is not within the scope of the intended use of P-GOVT designated property.

(c) The proposed use is not a permitted use within a Public designation, because a solar farm is not a listed use under Development Code section 16.16.430 (D)(1). Electrical, gas, water and sewage transmission facilities are permitted, but solar farms are not a permitted use on a parcel of land designated for public
use.
