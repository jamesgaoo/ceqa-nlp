Re: Challenge to Approval of Single Family Home and Tree Removal Permit Issued for 10034 Westwanda Drive, Los Angeles, CA; Environmental Log Reference 1-7459554991; Friends of Westwanda Drive v. City of Los Angeles et al.

Honorable Attorney General Becerra:
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under Public Resources Code 8211677 and Code of Civil Procedure Section §388, that on November 22, 2019, Friends of Westwanda Drive, filed a Verified Second Amended Petition Writ of Mandate against the City of Los Angeles ("Respondent" or "City"). You were previously notified of the initial filing of the petition for writ of mandate on September 23, 2019,

The lawsuit is pending in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The amended petition alleges, among other things, that the City incorrectly determined that the proposed single family home to be located at 10034 Westwanda Drive, Los Angeles, CA (which required a tree removal permit) ("Project") was exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"). Please call if you have any questions.

Sincerely, qieop

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

Petitioner, FRIENDS OF WESTWANDA DRIVE (*Petitioner"), alleges:

2 1. The project is proposed single-family dwelling on an undeveloped property
3 located at 10034 Westwanda Drive, Los Angeles, CA (*Project"). The Project contemplates the
removal of 954 cubic yards of soil for the construction of a 3,238 single-family dwelling on
approximately 4,009 square foot never-before developed steep hillside site. The Project is

6 located on a hillside parcel at 10034 Westwanda Drive in Benedict Canyon (which is within the
Santa Monica Mountains). Westwanda Drive is less than 20 feet in width in at least four separate

8 locations (otherwise known as a "substandard" street). The vacant site is a beautiful, hillside
9 untouched adjacent to a large habitat block officially mapped by the Santa Monica Mountain
10 Conservancy ("SMMC"). Among other things, the Project requires the removal of protected trees
11 and the issuance of a Tree Removal Permit from the City of Los Angeles. 8 d77 'dnoJs Law Channe 12 Petitioner, Friends of Westwanda ("Petitioner"), is an unincorporated association 41Z06 BUNS "PALE BJJUSIM E888 13 8 whose purpose is to promote the social welfare and environment in Benedict Canyon and in the 2.

SII!H Beverly area of Westwanda Drive in particular. Petitioner and its respective members have a direct and
15 | substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondent complies with laws relating to 14

16 environmental protection. Petitioner and its respective members are adversely affected by
17 Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA in approving the Project. Petitioner has standing to
18 assert the claims raised in this Petition because Petitioner and its members' aesthetic and

19 environmental interests are directly and adverscly affected by Respondent's' approval of the
20 Project.
21 3. Respondent, City of Los Angeles (*Respondent"), is a charter city incorporated
22 under the laws of the State of California. The City is the lead agency under the California
23 Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA").
24 4. Real Party in Interest, Karla Shahin is an owner of the property located at 10034

26  testified as to his interest in the project. At the public hearing before the Board of Public Works 25 Westwanda Drive. Mr. Melkonians appeared at all of the public hearings for the Project and

27 on March 7, 2018 Mr. Melkonians testificd as follows: "I'm the civil enginecr for the project.
28

2

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

I'm also the husband of the owner, so play a special role here today." Further, at the public
hearing before the Public Works and Gang Reduction Committee on August 7, 2019 Mr.
Melkonians testified as follows: "All right. I just wanted to introduce myself. Armen
4 Melkonians. I'm the owner." Finally, at the public hearing before the City Council on August 20,
2019 Mr. Melkonians testified as follows: "Good morning. Armen Melkonians, the property
owner." In written correspondence to the City Mr. Melkonians also stated that he was one of the
owners of the property. Mr. Melkonians also stated to various city officials and employecs his

8 intent to live at the proposed home with Ms. Shahin. At the Board of Public Works hearing Mr.

9 Melkonians testified as follows: "We plan on living there. We have a newborn. We just designed
10 this house for ourselves. She's done the design, my wife. We're going to build it. We're going to
11 live there. We're going to have a family." Based on these facts, Petitioner alleges that Real Party Channel Law Group, d71 LLZ06 09L GUNS "pAlg eJlySI!M €8E8 12 1n Interest Armen Melkonians has a direct interest in the development of the property in question
13
8 and is a real party in interest. Furthermore, based on the foregoing, Petitioner is informed and
SIl!H Auereg 14 believes that Armen Melkonians is an owner of the Project. Both Karla Shahin and Armen
15 Melkonians are hereinafter referred to collectively as "Real Party in Interest" or "Developer."
16 5. Real Party in Interest Armen Melkonians has threatened to institute litigation
17 against at least one member of Petitioner for opposing the Project. Failure to join Armen
18 Melkonians in the instant litigation would therefore "leave .. . persons already parties subject to
19 a substantial risk of incurring . . . inconsistent obligations by reason of his claimed interest."
20 Code Civ. Proc., § 389(a)(2)(ii). Accordingly, under such section, Mr. Melkonians is required to
21 be joined as a necessary party.
22 6. Petitioner is ignorant of the true names and capacities of Real Parties sued herein
23 as ROES 1-25, inclusive, and therefore sues these Real Parties by such fictitious names.
24 Petitioner will amend this Petition to allege the true names and capacitics of fictitiously named
25 Real Parties in Interest. Petitioner is informed and believes and thereon alleges that each
26 Respondent designated herein as a ROE has some responsibility for the events and happenings
27 alleged in this Petition.

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 7. On March 14, 2018, the City of Los Angeles Urban Forestry Division approved a
2 Tree Removal Permit in order to facilitate the Project. The City erroncously determined that the
Project was exempt from CEQA and issued a Notice of Exemption for the Project. The permit
4  authorized the removal of three Coast Live Oak Trees and six Southern California Black Walnut
Trees, which are both protected tree species pursuant to Ordinance No. 177404 which cannot be
removed without a determination by the Board of Public Works that removal is necessary in
order to allow for "reasonable development."

8. Petitioner filed an appeal of the environmental determination ("CEQA Appcal")
with the City Clerk on August 31, 2018 pursuant to Public Resources Code Section 21151(c).
10 This section of the Public Resources Code states as follows: "If a nonelected decisionmaking
11 body of a local lead agency certifies an environmental impact report, approves a negative Channel Law Group, d17 +LZ06 12

13 division, that certification, approval, or determination may be appealed to the agency's elected
SIlIH Aueneg 14 decisionmaking body, if any. A hearing was then conducted before the Public Works and Gang
15 Reduction Committee. Thereafter, the City Council denied Petitioner's appcal on August 20,
16 2019.

17 9. The developer filed a Notice of Exemption with the County Recorder on August
18 20, 2019. This action has been brought within 35 days of the filing of the aforementioned Noticc
19 of Exemption with the County Recorder.
20 10. This action arises under CEQA and its implementing regulations, which are
21 prescribed by the Secretary of the California Resources Agency to be followed by all state and
22 local agencies when undertaking projects subject to CEQA. (Pub. Resources Code§ 21000 et
23 seq.; Cal. Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 et seq.) This Court has jurisdiction over the matters
24 alleged in this Petition pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1085, and Public Resources
25 Code section 21168.5. In the alternative, this Court has jurisdiction pursuant to Code of Civil
26 Procedure section 1094.5 and Public Resources Code section 21168.

11. Pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 394(a) venue is proper in "the county
2 in which the city or local agency is situated." Venue is proper in this Court because Respondent 1

3 is located in the County of Los Angeles.

4 12. Members of Petitioner and other interested persons made oral and written
5 comments on the Project and raised each of the legal deficiencies asserted in this petition.

7 CEOA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

8 California Environmental Quality Act is California's broadest environmental
9 law. CEQA helps to guide public agencies such as the City during issuance of permits and 13.

10 approval of projects. Courts have interpreted CEQA to afford the fullest protection of the
11 environment within the reasonable scope of the statutes. CEQA applies to all discretionary 0949
discretionary government approval. See California Public Resources Code, sections 21000 - 8 euns "PAjE JjUS|IM €888 12 | projects proposed to be conducted or approved by a City, including private projects requiring 'dnoJo Mel |euueuo LIZOE

SI!!H Beverly 14 21178, and Title 14 Cal. Code Regs., section 753, and Chapter 3, sections 15000 - 15387. 13

15 14. "CEQA broadly defines a 'project' as 'an activity which may cause either a direct
16 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the
17 environment, and ... that involves the issuance to a person of a lease, permit, license, certificate,
18 or other entitlement for use by one or more public agencies.' [Citation.] The statutory definition
19 is augmented by the [CEQA] Guidelines [Cal.Code Regs., tit. 14, § 15000 ct scq.], which define
20 a 'project' as 'the whole of an action, which has potential for resulting in cither a direct
21 physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the
environment....""* Tuolumne County Citizens for Responsible Growth, Inc. V. City of Sonora
23 (2007) 155 Cal.App.4th 1214, 1222, 66 Cal.Rptr.3d 645 (Tuolumne County). This includes all 22

24 phases of a project that are reasonably foreseeable, and all related projects that are directly linked
25 to the project. (CEQA Guidelines section 15378).
26 15. A strong presumption in favor of requiring preparation of an Environmental
27 Impact Report ("EIR") is built into CEQA which is reflected in what is known as the "fair

5 16. "The EIR is the primary means of achieving the Legislature's considered

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION 24 (Violation of the California Environmental Quality Act)
25 18. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporate by reference the preceding paragraphs of this
26 Petition.
27 19. The City determined that the Project was exempt from CEQA as a Class 3 project.
28

6

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 The Class 3 exemption is reserved for new construction or conversion of small structures (which

2 include the construction of one single family dwelling). However, according to the State CEQA
3 Guidelines, the following exceptions are applicable to the use of this exemption:
4 (a) Location. Classes 3,4, 5, 6, and 11 are qualified by consideration of where the

5 project is to be located a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its impact on the

0 environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant. Therefore, these
7 classes are considered to apply all instances, except where the project may impact on an

8 environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely
mapped, and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.
10 (b) Cumulative Impact. All exemptions for these classes are inapplicable when the
11
8 cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is
Channei Law Group, d77 8383 Wilshire Blvd., Suite LLZ06 12 significant.

8 13 (c) Significant Effect. A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity
SI!H Áuereg 14 where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on
15 the environment due to unusual circumstances.

16 (d) Scenic Highways. A categorical exemption shall not be used for project
17 which may result in damage to scenic resources, including but not limited to, trees,
18 historic buildings, rock outcroppings, or similar resources, within a highway officially
19 designated as a state scenic highway. This does not apply to improvements which are
20 required as mitigation by an adopted negative declaration or certified EIR.
21 (e) Hazardous Waste Sites. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project
22 located on a site which is included on any list compiled pursuant to Section 65962.5 of
23 the Government Code.

24 (f) Historical Resources. A categorical exemption shall not be used for a project
25 which may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.
26 20. The City also determined that the Project was exempt from CEQA as a Class 3 2 a
27 urban infill project. However, this exemption is not available when there arc "unusual
28

circumstances" associated with the Project.

21. As explained below, the City erroncously concluded that the Project was eligible
for the Class 3 and Class 32 categorical exemptions.

Exemption.As explained in the CEQA Guidelines, "a project that is ordinarily insignificant in its 22. The Project's Location and Impacts Prevents the City from Utilizing the Class 3

impact on the environment may in a particularly sensitive environment be significant." CEQA
Guidelines Section 15300.2(a). An exemption does not apply where the project may impact on
8 an environmental resource of hazardous or critical concern where designated, precisely mapped,
9  and officially adopted pursuant to law by federal, state, or local agencies.
10 23. The Santa Monica Mountains Comprehensive Plan was adopted in 1979. The
11 property is subject to the Plan because it is located within the Santa Monica Mountains Zone. 8 d77 Group, MET jeuueyo L1Z06 The Zone was established by the Legislature via the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy Act,

5 e}ns "paja eUjys!!M €8cg 13 which is codified at Section 33001 of the Public Resources Code. The Act states as follows: 12

'SII!H AueAg 14
The Legislature hereby finds and declares that the Santa Monica Mountains Zone, as 15 defined in Section 33105, is a unique and
16 valuable cconomic, environmental, agricultural, scientific, educational, and recreational resource that should be held in trust for present and future gencrations; that, 17 as the last large undeveloped area contiguous to the shoreline within the greater Los Angeles metropolitan region, comprised of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties, it 18 provides essential relief from the urban environment; that it exists as a single
19 ccosystem in which changes that affect one part may also affect all other parts; and that
the preservation and protection of this resource is in the public interest."
20

24. The Legislature itsclf declared that the Santa Monica Mountains Zone is
22 a unique and valuable environmental resource that provided essential relief from the urban 21

23 environment. The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy Act goes on to say the following:

24
"in the absence of a governmental mechanism to perform such evaluations, piecemeal 25 development projects were occurring within the zone which resulted in
the irreplaceable loss of open space and recreational resources, in the physical and 26 biological deterioration of air, land, and water systems within the zone, and adversely
27 affected regional life-support systems, including fish and wildlife, therefore being harmful to the needs of the present and future population of the region." 28

8

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 25. The Legislature further declared at PRC Section 33008 that:

"there are existing problems of substandard lots, incompatible land uses, conflicts with recreational use, and inadequate resource protection which, in some cases, cannot be addressed in a feasible manner by local government exercise of the police power or federal land acquisition as part of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Arca, 5 and that it is necessary to enact the provisions of this division as a complement to the full

6 exercise of the police power by local governments . .'

7
26. The Legislature also stated that "the people of the State of California have an 8

9 interest in the protection of resources and the use of lands acquired or managed by the

10 conservancy pursuant to this division, and that the conservancy in carrying out its duties pursuant
to this division acts on behalf of the State of California." 11
27. The City of Los Angeles adopted a formal resolution in 1979 undertaking its 12
Channel Law Group, LIZ06 13 intent to implement the Plan as the local agency with planning and land use jurisdiction. The
8 0549 L BINS "PALE BJLUSIIM E888 14 Plan was mandated by the Legislature and is a planning tool designed to help conserve and
SIl!H Áueseg 15 preserve the Santa Monica Mountains. Policy No. 21 specifically deals with Wildlife Protection.
28. The property's value as habitat for flora and fauna cannot be disputed. The entire 16

17 area serves as a refuge for area wildlife. Refuges such as this are important elements of the urban

18 landscape and their value cannot be dismissed. Developments like the proposed Project displace

19 'urban wildlife' into residential backyards and city streets, and habitat disruption can result in an

20 imbalance on food chain populations and lead wildlifc to seek both food and shelter in residential

21 arcas and to stray into city strects and public areas.

29. The future viability of hundreds of California's wildlife species are dependent on 22

23 the maintenance of biologically functional and contiguous oak and walnut woodland ecosystems

24 at local and bioregional scales. Oak/walnut woodlands are incredibly important the local wildlife.

30. Under these circumstances (where a project may impact on an environmental 25

26 resource of critical concern) a party need only demonstrate a "fair argument" that a project may

27 have significant effect on the environment. This standard of review was recently outlined in

28 Berkeley Hills Watershed Coalition v. City of Berkeley (2019) 31 Cal.App.5th 880. There should

9

SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

no doubt that the Santa Monica Mountains Zone comprises an environmental resource of
2 critical concern. As noted in Berkeley Hills Watershed Coalition, a "resource" is a "natural 1 be

source of wealth or revenue," or a "natural feature or phenomenon that enhances the quality of
4l human life." Legislature's explicit findings regarding the characteristics of the Zone in the Santa 3

Monica Mountains Conservancy Act more than meets this definitional requirement. Further,
6 Petitioner demonstrated during the administrative process that the Project will have a potentially 5

7 significant environmental impact even after replacement trees are planted. Petitioner

8 commissioned an expert report and the author concluded that the loss of habitat of a sensitive
natural community constitutes a significant impact that is not mitigated by application of the

10

11 In sum, the use of the Class 3 single-family home exemption cannot be used City's Protected Tree Ordinance.

31. 8 d77 dnoJ5 Mel |euueuo LLZO6 12 BUNS "PA¡S BJJUSIIM E888 because of the project's location and the potential for significant impacts on the environment.

8 13 The Santa Monica Mountains are an environmental resource of critical concern that have been
SIl!H Auenag 14 designed and precisely mapped pursuant to state law, and the Project will have potentially
15 significant impact on the environment.
16 32. Unusual Circumstances Pertaining to Biological Resources Renders Both Class 3

18 unavailable due to "unusual circumstances." Application of both exemptions is limited by the 17 and Class 32 Exemption Unavailable. Both of the exemptions utilized by the City are

20 listed in section 15300.2 of the Guidelines applies. Section 15300.2, subdivision (c), of the 19 factors described in section 15300.2.3 An exemption should be denied if one of the exceptions

21 Guidelines provides for one such exception and states that if there is a "reasonable possibility"
22 of "significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances," then the categorical
exception cannot apply. A "circumstance is 'unusual' ... judged relative to the typical
24 | circumstances related to an otherwise typically exempt project." Voices for Rural Living V. El
25 Dorado Irr. Dist. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 1096, 1108-09. Petitioner commissioned an cxpert 23

26 report from Land Protection Partners to demonstrate that mere replacement of trees would not
27 reduce the impacts of the Project on biological resources. Notably, the expert concluded that

Measures in the Form of Specialized Conditions of Approval for the Project. Significantly, in 33. The Project is Not Exempt from CEQA Because the City Has Proposed Mitigation

5 evaluating whether a categorical exemption may apply, the City may not rely on mitigation

6 measures as a basis for concluding that a project is categorically exempt, or as a basis for
7 determining that one of the significant effects exceptions does not apply. Salmon Protection &

8 Watershed Network v. County of Marin (2004) 125 Cal.App.4th 1098.

34. The City has sought to deem this project "exempt" from City by way of an

10 environmental mitigation measure namely, the planting of replacement trees on the property.
11 However, the general requirement to plant replacement trees is not a regulatory compliance 0948 8383 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 12 measure at all. Rather, it is a discretionary environmental mitigation measure. The City's Group, MET jeuueuo L1Z06
8 13 Protected Tree Ordinance states as follows:
14 "The Board of Public Works or its authorized officer or employee may [r]equire as a SI!H Beverly 15 condition of a grant of permit for the relocation or removal of a protected tree, that the
16 permittee replace the tree within the same property boundaries by at least two trees of a
17 protected varicty included within the definition set forth in Section 46.01 of this Code, in
18 a manner acceptable to the Board."
19

The Ordinance uses the word "may" -- not "shall." This is significant. The tree LAMC Section 46.02(c).
20 35.

21 replacements that are traditionally mandated by the Board of Public Works are discretionary
environmental mitigation measures. They are not mandatory "regulatory compliance measures."
23 The City cannot use a mitigation measure to reach a determination that a project is cxempt from 22

24 CEQA. This is fundamental black letter CEQA law.
25 36. Further, the Grading Division has issued a Geology and Soils Report Approval
26 Letter for the Project. This letter contains numerous conditions of approval. Many of these
27 conditions are not simply applications of the California Building Code or existing City of Los
28

11

Angeles regulations. The fact that the Geology Report contains specialized mitigation measures
renders the application of a categorical exemption in appropriate and unlawful.

Application of Mitigation Measures to Another Date. Additionally, many of the conditions of 37. The Project is Also Not Exempt from CEQA Because the City Seeks to Defer

approval in the Geology and Soils Report Approval Letter simply "kick the can" down the road
and defer required environmental analysis to another date. This does not comply with CEQA.
38. Conditioning a project on another agency's future review of environmental
8 impacts, without evidence of the likelihood of effective mitigation by the other agency, is
9

mitigated. Sundstrom v. Cnty. of Mendocino (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 296. Further, requiring insufficient to support determination by the lead agency that potentially significant impacts will
