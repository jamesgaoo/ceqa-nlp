3 Community Environmental Advocates Foundation, Protect Grass Valley and Ralph A.

4 Silberstein (collectively, the "Petitioners") filed a Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate

5 (*Petition") against the City of Grass Valley and the R. Jeter Family Trust, and DOES 1-20 as

6 Real Party(ies) in Interest (cach a "Respondent," and, collectively, the "Respondents") in Nevada
County Superior Court. The Petition alleges that the Respondents violated the California
Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA") by approving a project in such a manner to allow a changes
8 to the land use and zoning designations without first conducting a reasonable and legally
adequate environmental review of the project, in that Respondents prepared and relied on an
10 environmental impact report ("EIR") that fall well below CEQA's minimum standards. The City
11 Council's approval operates in stark contravention of CEQA, Public Resources Code § 21000 et

12 seq., the CEQA Guidelines, Title 14 California Code of Regulations, § 15000 et seq., and the

13 State Planning and Zoning Law, Government Code § 65300 et seq. §

hereof.

27 ENVIRONMENTAL ADVOCATES FOUNDATION and PROTECT GRASS VALLEY
("Petitioners"), allege as follows:
28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

INTRODUCTION

2 1. This Verified Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition") challenges the decision of the
3 City of Grass Valley ("City" or "Respondent"), on April 28, 2020, to approve the Dorsey Marketplace

4 Project ("Project" or "Dorsey Marketplace"), a General Plan Amendment, a Zone Change, a a

5 Development Review Permit and a Use Permit for drive-through facilities and a Lot Line Adjustment
6 (*Approvals"), as well as the certification of the Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") in connection
7 with a proposed mixed-use development on the site of the now-abandoned Spring Hill Mine along State
8 Route 49 ("SR 49"), between the SR 49 off-ramps for Dorsey Drive and Idaho-Maryland Road, bounded
9 by SR 49 to the west, Dorsey Drive to the north, commercial property to the south, and residential
10 property to the east ("Project").

11 2. The City's approach to environmental review of the Project's impacts has been
12 fundamentally flawed under the California Environmental Quality Act ("CEQA"), embodied in Public
13 Resources Code ("PRC") §§ 21000, et seq. The City has failed to conduct an informationally adequate
14 environmental review that provides to the public an accurate Project Description, or that sufficiently
15 analyzes the Project's Impacts on the environment and on human health.
16 3. Members of Petitioners participated extensively in the public review process for the
17 Project, providing detailed Comments on the sufficiency of the EIR's analysis, identifying unanalyzed
18 Impacts, and introducing substantial evidence relevant to those Impacts. The City, in turn, failed to take
19 the issues raised by Petitioners seriously. Rather than address the significant gaps in the EIR's analysis,
20 the City took multiple opportunities to dismiss Petitioners' concerns regarding the Project's Impacts to
21 the environment and human health. The City time and again demonstrated it approached this Project
22 with tunnel vision. Immense public concern was not enough for the City to entertain modifications to
23 the Project, or Mitigation of, its Significant Environmental Impacts.
24 4. Accordingly, Petitioners seek a Writ of Mandamus ordering the City to set aside Project
25 Approvals and certification of the EIR, and to conduct a reasonable and adequate environmental review
26 of the Project.

P PARTIES

2 5. Petitioners, COMMUNITY ENVIRONMENTAL ADVOCATES and COMMUNITY
3 ENVIRONMENTAL ADVOCATES FOUNDATION (collectively, "CEA"), are related but distinct
4 California non-profit advocacy groups with the mission to perform research, educate, and promote
5 public policies that result in responsible land use and environmental protection in Nevada County and

6 the greater Sierra Nevada region. CEA supports efforts to preserve natural landscapes in rural
7 communities, control urban sprawl, and empower the public in land use decisions.

8 6. Petitioner, PROTECT GRASS VALLEY ("PGV"), is an unincorporated association of

9 I people who live and/or work in Grass Valley. PGV was formed after, and in response to, the City's
10 approval of the Project by individuals who are concerned about the Project's Significant Environmental
11 and human health Impacts. PGV's membership includes individuals who commented on, and/or

12 objected to, the Project.
13 7. Respondent, THE CITY OF GRASS VALLEY, is a municipal corporation, organized
14 under the laws of the State of California, that exercises local government power, including land use
15 authority. As the CEQA "Lead Agency" for the Project, the City is responsible for preparation of an
16 environmental review document that describes the Project and its Impacts and, if necessary, evaluates
17 Mitigation Measures and/or Alternatives to lessen or avoid any Significant Environmental Impacts.
18 8. Real Party in Interest, R JETER FAMILY TRUST (*Applicant" or "RPI", and,
19 collectively, with the City "Respondents"), is the applicant seeking the Approvals for the Project.
20 9. Petitioners are unaware of the true names and capacities of RPI DOES 1 through 20, and,
21 therefore, names such RPIs by such fictitious names. Petitioners are informed and believe, and based on

22 such information and belief, allege that the fictitiously named RPIs are also responsible for the actions

23 described in this Petition. When the true identities and capacities of DOES 1 through 20 have been
24 determined, Petitioners will seek leave from the Court to amend this Petition to insert such identities and

25 capacities.

STATEMENT OF EACTS

2 1. Project Background

3 10. The Project Site is the former location of the Spring Hill Mine, and includes excavations,

4 pits, building foundation remnants, waste rock, and dry tailing ponds. The Project Site is currently

5 characterized by its Chaparral and Coniferous Woodland.
11. The Project Site has been classified as a "Brownfield Site" as defined by the Brownfields
Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act of 2001, indicating that reuse of the location "may be
7 complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant."
8 42 U.S.C. 9601 § 39(A) The Project Site contains arsenic, lead, and mercury associated with mining
9 activity.

10 12. The EIR for the Project includes two Project Alternatives, A and B, and purports to

11 evaluate each equally. Both Alternatives A and B contemplate mixed-use developments that include

12 residential and retail uses. Alternative A would include 178,960 square feet of commercial land use, and
90 residential units. Alternative B would include 104,350 square feet of commercial use and 172
13 residential units. Both alternatives would require a General Plan Amendment and Zone Change from
14 Commercial Business Park to the C-2 Central Business District and R-3 Multifamily Residential, and
15 Residential Urban High Density.

16 13. The Project represents a unique risk in that it would endanger existing nearby residents,

17 future occupants, and the environment by virtue of its location alone. As a Brownfield Site, construction

18 of the Project would unnecessarily expose adjacent Grass Valley residents to hazardous substances and
deleterious construction noise. The Project is also bordered in part by SR 49, a source of toxic air
19 contaminant ("TAC") and ultrafine particulate ("UFP") emissions.
20 14. TAC and UFP emissions, primarily from diesel fuel or from idled cars, can cause severe
21 health impacts to residents who live near freeways and road segments with high traffic delays. UFP

22 emissions have been linked to increased rates of ischemic heart disease a and a myriad of prenatal health

23 issues. By adding additional residents to the area, the Project will add additional vehicles to SR 49,

24 thereby exacerbating the existing emissions problem and the corresponding health impacts, which the
City has failed to disclose. Without the full analysis required by CEQA, the public is left in the dark as 25 to the full Health Impacts of the Project.
26 15. Adding additional residents and vehicles to Grass Valley would also exacerbate Traffic
27 delays and greenhouse gas emissions ("GHG(s)"). The City has been unwilling to analyze these Impacts

28
VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 4-

P adequately. The California State Legislature recently required a shift from measuring Traffic Impacts

2 by level of service ("LOS") delays to measuring vehicle miles traveled ("VMT(s)). The City was
expressly advised about the change, which became effective on July 1, 2020 and will apply to any
3 judgment in this proceeding, yet refused to engage in the required analysis. Public Comments on the
4 Project noted that the commercial element of the Project is likely to bring in workers from outside of
5 Grass Valley, thereby increasing VMTs. In turn, a significant increase in VMTs can have significant

6 GHG impacts. Members of Petitioners, who are residents of Grass Valley, may also work on the

7 Project, will be directly Impacted by any hazardous materials that may be found at the Site. The City's

8 refusal to analyze VMTs and GHGs, and other potential environmental harms, has resulted in the public
a being denied a full understanding of the Project's Environmental and Health Impacts. 9 16. Rather than Mitigate the Impacts, the City ignored the concerns voiced by local residents.
10 For instance, the Project does not include enforceable Mitigation Measures for the necessary road
11 improvements required by virtue of the increased VMTs. The City also missed numerous opportunities
12 to limit the Project's GHG footprint, whether by requiring a Solar Power Construction Element and

13 Energy Efficient Building Design (indeed, the City Council has recently removed the condition

14 requiring all-electric heating and solar building design from the residential portion of the Project), or by

15 increasing the Project's Walkability. Moreover, the City refused to Mitigate GHG-related Impacts, and
the residents of Grass Valley, including future residents of the Project, will suffer for it.
16 17. In addition, the City has ignored the Project's Impacts to Biological Resources and
17 Special-Status Species. Despite being a Brownfield Site, Special-Status Species can occur at the Project
18 Site. The City only conducted a database survey to conclude that such species are not present, despite

19 regulatory guidance that field observations are the appropriate method of determining a species'

20 a presence at a location. The failure to make the appropriate field observations affords further evidence

21 of a self-serving and predetermined approach by the City.

22 2. The Environmental Review and Approval Process
23
18. RPI first submitted an application for the Approvals on the Project Site in December 24

25 2015. The City prepared a draft EIR ("DEIR") for the Project in 2016. RPI then revised the Project to
include an Alternative Site Plan, known as Alternative B, in 2017. 26

27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 5 -

- 19. The DEIR was made available from March 22 to May 6, 2019. Petitioner, CEA,
2 provided Comments on the Project and the DEIR, describing the legal inadequacies of the DEIR and the

3 City's analysis of the Project's Impacts on the Environment,
4 20. On April 16, 2019, the Grass Valley Planning Commission held a hearing on the DEIR.
5 Thereafter, on May 28th, and on August 27, 2019, the Grass Valley Development Review Committee

6

7 ("DRC"), which reviews and acts on minor development proposals and advises the Planning

8 Commission on larger projects, held public meetings on the matter. Thereafter, the DRC recommended

9 to the Planning Commission that the City support Alternative B.
21.

10 The City released the Final EIR in October 2019. Virtually none of the issues raised by

11 Petitioners' Comments on the DEIR had been addressed in the Final EIR. Petitioner CEA, and others,

12 provided additional Public Comments on the Final EIR that reiterated the previously identified issues
and detailed further concerns specific to the Final EIR.

13 22.

14 On December 3, 2019, the Planning Commission reviewed the Final EIR and

15 recommended that the City Council certify the EIR, and approve Alternative B.

23. On April 14, 2020, the City prepared a memorandum in response to Public Comments on
16 the Final EIR (*Memorandum"). The Memorandum was attached to the City's Staff Report for the
17 April 28, 2020 City Council meeting ("City Staff Report").

18 24. The Public provided further Comments on the City Staff Report, detailing analytical
19 flaws in the Memorandum in response to Comments on the Final EIR.

20 25.

21 The City Council held a hearing on April 28, 2020 to consider the Project and the

22 Approvals. Afterwards, the City Council approved Alternative B and granted the Approvals, certified
the EIR, and adopted a Statement of Overriding Considerations.

23 26.

24 The City filed its Notice of Determination ("NOD") for the Project on April 29, 2020.

29, This Petition is timely filed in accordance with PRC § 21167(b), as the same was
2 amended by Emergency Rule 9 and Amended Emergency Rule 9. The City filed its NOD for the
3 Project on April 29, 2020 as required by CEQA Guidelines § 21167(b).
4 30. On March 17, 2020 California's Governor Gavin Newsom issued Stay-at-Home Orders
5 for all California citizens in response to the rising COVID-19 pandemic. This Court immediately closed
6 its doors to the public. On April 16, 2020 the California Supreme Court issued Emergency Rule 9, which
7 stated:

8 Notwithstanding any other law, the statutes of limitation for civil causes of action are tolled from April 6, 2020, until 90 days after
9 the Governor declares that the state of emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic is lifted.
10

11 31. Emergency Rule 9 was subsequently amended, effective as of May 29, 2020 ("Amended

12 Emergency Rule 9").' Amended Emergency Rule 9(b) tolls the time within which the instant Petition

13 must be filed. Petitioners have until August 3, 2020 within which to file this Petition.

14

15 EXHAUSTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES

16 32. Petitioners have exhausted administrative remedies to the extent required by law.

17 Petitioners have performed all conditions precedent to this filing and participated in the administrative

18 process. Petitioners, either directly or through their members, actively participated in the administrative

19 process leading up to the City's granting of the Approvals for the Project and certification of the EIR

20 and repeatedly stated their objections to the City's actions.

21 33. Respondents have taken final Lead Agency actions with respect to granting the

22 Approvals for the Project and certifying the EIR in connection therewith. The City has a mandatory

4 STANDING

5 34. Petitioner, CEA, has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because its

6 members include residents of the City of Grass Valley, who have personal, health, safety, community
7 and environmental interests that are directly and adversely affected by the City's Approval of the Project
and certification of the EIR. As an organization partially composed of people who live and work within
9 the City, Petitioner CEA is within the class of persons beneficially interested in, and aggrieved by, the
10 acts of Respondents as alleged hereinbelow.

11 35. Petitioner, PGV, has standing to assert the claims raised in this Petition because its
12 members include individuals who reside and/or work in the City of Grass Valley, who have personal,
13 health, safety, community and environmental interests that are directly and adversely affected by the
14 City's Approval of the Project and certification of the EIR. As an association partially composed of
15 people who live and work within the City, Petitioner, PGV, is within the class of persons beneficially
16 interested in, and aggrieved by, the acts of Respondents as alleged hereinbelow.
17 36. Petitioners have a substantial interest in ensuring the Project's Environmental Impacts are
18 adequately Mitigated. Unless the relief requested herein is granted, Petitioners' members' health and

19 safety, environmental and community interests will be adversely affected and injured by Respondent's
20 failure to comply with CEQA in granting the Approvals for the Project and certifying the EIR. The
21 City's Approval of the Project is also a matter of public interest.
22

23 IRREPARABLE HARM

24 37. The City's failures, enumerated in this Petition, constitute a Prejudicial Abuse of
25 Discretion within the meaning of the Code of Civil Procedure and CEQA.

26 38. Petitioners possesses no remaining remedy to challenge the City's abuse of discretion,
27 other than by means of this lawsuit. If the City's actions concerning the Project are effectuated,
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 Petitioners, their members and their health, the residents of Grass Valley, and the Environment will be
2 irreparably harmed. No money damages could adequately compensate for that harm.

4 PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL DOCTRINE

5 36. Petitioners bring this action as a private attorney general pursuant to 8 CCP § 1021.5, and

6 any other applicable legal theory, to enforce important rights affecting the public interest.

7 37. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will confer a significant benefit on the

8 Public by requiring Respondents to carry out their duties under CEQA before granting the Approvals, or
9 certifying an EIR, for the Project.

10 38. Issuance of the relief requested in this Petition will also result in the enforcement of

11 important rights affecting the public interest by compelling Respondents to engage in a fair, objective,
12 and legally adequate analysis of the Project's Environmental Impacts, and to ensure that the Public has a
13 meaningful opportunity to review and comment on the Impacts and on Mitigation Measures for the
14 Project.

15 39. The necessity and financial burden of enforcement are such as to make an award of
16 attorneys' fees and costs appropriate in this case. Absent enforcement by Petitioners, Respondent, City,
17 and RPI, will proceed with a Project that will cause significant, unmitigated human health and
18 Environmental Impacts that might, otherwise, have been reduced, or avoided, through legally adequate
19 environmental review and the adoption of feasible Mitigation Measures.

1 REQUEST TO PREPARE ADMINISTRATIVE RECORD

2 41. Petitioners hereby request that Respondents prepare the Record of Proceedings in this
3 action pursuant to PRC § 21167.6(b)(2). A true and correct copy of the Notice of Request for
4 Administrative Record is attached hereto as Exhibit B and is made a part hereof.
5

6 FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION
7 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: EIR Does Not Comply With CEQA) 8
42.
9 Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate the allegations contained in Paragraphs |
through 41, above, inclusive, as though each were fully set forth herein.
10
43.
11 CEQA has two basic purposes, neither of which has been satisfied by the EIR. Firstly,
CEQA is designed to inform decisionmakers, and the public about the potential Significant
12 Environmental Effects of a project. CEQA Guidelines $15002(a)(1). CEQA requires that an agency
13 analyze potentially significant Environmental Impacts in an EIR. PRC §21000; CEQA Guidelines
14 §15002. Specifically, an EIR should result from "extensive research and information gathering,'
15 including consultation with state and federal agencies, local officials, and the interested public.

16 (emphasis added.) Berkeley Keep Jets Over the Bay Comm. v. Board of Port Comm. (2001) 91

17 Cal.App.4t h 1344, 1367.
44. To be adequate, the EIR should evidence the Lead Agency's good faith effort at full 18 disclosure. CEQA Guidelines §15151. The environmental review has been described as "an
19 environmental 'alarm bell' whose purpose it is to alert the public and its responsible officials to
20 environmental changes before they have reached ecological points of no return." County of Inyo v. Yorty
21 (1973) 32 Cal.App.3d 795, 810. Thus, the environmental review protects not only the environment but

22 also informed self-government." Citizens of Goleta Valley v. Bd. of Supervisors (1990) 52 Cal.3d 553,

23 564.

45. Secondly, CEQA directs public agencies to avoid, or reduce, environmental damage 24 when possible by requiring alternatives, or mitigation measures. CEQA Guidelines §15002(a)(2)-(3).
25 The environmental review serves to provide public agencies and the public in general with information
26 about the effect that a proposed project is likely to have on the environment and to "identify ways that
27 environmental damage can be avoided or significantly reduced." CEQA Guidelines §15002(a)(2). If a

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 10 -

project has a significant effect on the environment, the agency may approve the project only upon a

2 finding that it has "eliminated or substantially lessened all significant effects on the environment where
feasible," and that any unavoidable significant effects on the environment are "acceptable due to
3 overriding concerns" specified in CEQA §21081. CEQA Guidelines §§ 15092(b)(2)(A)-(B).
4
46.
5 Under CEQA Guidelines § 15088.5, recirculation of an EIR is required when "significant
new information" is added to the EIR after public review, but prior to certification of a final EIR. The 6

7 term "information" can include changes in the project or environmental setting, as well as additional
data or other information. "Significant new information" requiring recirculation may include a

9 disclosure showing that new or more severe Significant Impacts would result, that feasible Mitigation

10 Measures would address Impacts is not being adopted, or that the EIR was so fundamentally and

11 basically inadequate and conclusory in nature that meaningful Public review and Comment were
precluded.
12

13 1. Impacts From Zone Change and General Plan Amendment

14 47. The Project Approvals include General Plan Amendment and a Zone Change that will

15 greatly impact the entire area surrounding the Project. Specifically, the zoning for the area of the Project

16 is proposed to be changed from Zone Change from Commercial Business Park to the C-2 Central
Business District and R-3 Multifamily Residential, and Residential Urban High Density. This is a
17 significant change that sets a precedent for development in the area that may involve Significant Impacts
18 to Traffic Patterns, VMT, Noise, and public and worker health and safety, both during, and after,
19 construction.

20 48. The EIR did not fully consider the Impacts of the requested Amendment to the General

21 Plan and the Zone Change, inasmuch as they would, in turn, Impact Water Usage, Air Quality, Traffic,

22 Noise, Health and Safety, and other environmental issues in the area, both during construction, and after
this Project is built. These Water, Traffic, Noisc, Health, Safety and other Impacts are Significant, 23 deleterious, and Unavoidable. The failure to consider these issues renders the EIR ineffective as an
24 environmental review document. As a result, the EIR lacks substantial evidence to support its
25 conclusions and fails to mitigate reasonably and/or adequately the Project's Significant Environmental
26 Impacts.

27 49. For the reasons stated herein, the Project Approvals must be set aside and an

28 environmental review must be conducted to address the errors and deficiencies that exist in the areas of

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

• 11 -

Traffic, VMTs, Air Quality and GHGs, soil contamination, water contamination and usage, Noise, Land

2 Use, Health and Safety in Grass Valley.
50.
3 As a result therefrom, Respondents prejudicially abused their discretion by certifying an
EIR that does not comply with CEQA and by approving the Project in reliance thereon. As the City did
4 not proceed in the manner required by law, its decisions in granting the Approvals for the Project and
5 certifying the EIR are not supported by substantial evidence Respondents' certification of the EIR and

6 approval of the Project must be set aside. PRC § 21168.5

7
2.
8 The Project Description is Vague, Incomplete, and Unstable

9 51. CEQA requires that an EIR include an accurate Project Description, and that the nature

10 and objective of project be fully disclosed and fairly evaluated in an EIR. An EIR should contain a

11 "sufficient degree of analysis to provide decision-makers with information which enables them to make

a decision which intelligently takes account of environmental consequences." CEQA Guidelines § 12 15151. "An accurate, stable and finite project description is the sine qua non of an informative and
13 legally sufficient EIR." County of Inyo v. City of Los Angeles (1977) 71 Cal. App. 3d 185, 193. "Only
14 through an accurate view of the project may affected outsiders and public decision makers balance the
15 proposal's benefit against its environmental cost, consider mitigation measures, assess the advantage of
16 terminating the proposal . .. and weigh other alternatives in the balance." Id. at 192-93. A project
17 description may not provide conflicting signals to decision makers and the public about the nature and

18 scope of the project as such a description is fundamentally inadequate and misleading.

19 52. The Project Description in the EIR. is deficient because it lacks adequate specificity

20 required to analyze the Project's Impacts, is shifting and unstable, and fails to include the whole of the

21 Project.

22 53. As just one example, the EIR fails to disclose Project activities such as site remediation

23 and other actions required due to the Project site being an abandoned mine.

24

25 SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION

26 (VIOLATIONS OF CEQA: Inadequate Findings in the EIR)
27

28 54. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

12 -

through 41, above, inclusive, as though each were fully set forth herein.
55.
2 CEQA requires that a Lead Agency's Findings for the approval of a project be supported
by substantial evidence in the administrative record. CEQA Guidelines § 15091(b). CEQA further 3 requires that a Lead Agency provide an explanation of how evidence in the record supports the
4 conclusions it has reached. CEQA Guidelines Id., at subd. (a).
5 Sfr. Respondents violated CEQA by adopting Findings that are inadequate as a matter of law

6 in that they are not supported by substantial evidence in the Record, including, but not limited to, the

7 following:

8 1. The EIR Fails to Analyze Reasonably or Adequately the Project's Significant Environmental Impacts
9 57. CEQA requires that an EIR describe the proposed Project's Significant Environmental
10 Impacts. Each Significant Impact must be revealed and fully analyzed in the EIR. PRC § 21100(b);
11 CEQA Guidelines 15126.2(a)
12 58. The EIR fails reasonably and/or adequately to disclose, analyze, mitigate, and avoid
13 potentially Significant Impacts, including, but not limited to:

14 a. Transportation and VMTs;

15 b. Construction GHGs;

16 C. Operations GHGs and toxic air contaminants and resulting Human Health Impacts;

17 d. Soil contaminants;

18 e. Danger to biological resources and special-status species;
f
19 Adequacy of public services;

20 g. Noise and associated Human Health Impacts;

21 h. Water Supply Assessment;
i. Land Use; and
22 j. Urban Decay.
23
2.
24 The EIR Fails to Analyze Reasonably and/or Adequately the Project's Cumulative
Impacts

25 59. An EIR must discuss Cumulative Impact if the project's incremental effect combined

26 with the effects of other projects is cumulatively Significant. CEQA Guidelines § 15130 (a). In

27 performing a Cumulative Impact Analysis, the Lead Agency must evaluate project's Incremental

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

13 •

Effects in connection with the effects of past projects, other current projects, and probable future

2 projects. CEQA Guidelines § 15065 (a)(3) An EIR must make a reasonable, good faith effort to

3 disclose Cumulative Impacts.

4 60. The EIR fails to adequately disclose, analyze, mitigate and avoid potentially Significant

5 Cumulative Impacts including, but not limited to:

a.
6 Traffic;

7 b. Air quality and GHGs;

C. Water Supply;
8 d. Danger to biological resources and special-status species;
9
e. Noise and the associated Human Health Impacts; and
10 f. Adequacy of public services.
11

12 61. The EIR fails to rely on an accurate geographic scope of cumulative projects and fails to

13 include all past, current, and future projects in its Cumulative Impact Analysis.

14
THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION
15 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: The EIR Fails to Implement All Feasible Mitigation Measures)
16
62.
17 Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate the allegations contained in Paragraphs :
through 41, above, inclusive, as though each were fully set forth herein. 18 63. Under CEQA, Respondent may not approve the Project as proposed when there are
19 feasible Mitigation Measures available which would substantially lessen one of the Project's Significant
20 Environmental Impacts. PRC, § 21002.

21 64. A Lead Agency may not approve a project that will have Significant Environmental
22 Impacts if there are feasible Mitigation Measures that would substantially lessen those Impacts. PRC §§
23 21002; CEQA Guidelines §§ 15002(a)(3) and 15021(a)(2)
24 65. A Lead Agency must provide that Mitigation Measures are fully enforceable through
25 permit conditions, agreements, or other measures. PRC § 21081.6(b)
26

27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

14 -

1 66. An EIR must contain facts and analysis disclosing to the Lead Agency the analytical
2 route traveled from evidence to action, not just the agency's bare conclusions and opinions. An EIR

3 must then describe Mitigation Measures and explain why they will work.
4 67. The EIR fails to include such facts and analysis for any Mitigation Measure relied upon
5 to limit the Project's Significant Environmental Impacts.
6 68. Mitigation Measures are also incorporated into the Project Description. An EIR cannot
7 incorporate proposed Mitigation Measures into its Project Description as a means to then conclude that

8 potential Impacts would be Less Than Significant. Doing so prevents an accurate determination of a
9 Mitigation Measure's effectiveness.

10 69. Mitigation Measures in the EIR are unenforceable, impermissibly vague, and inadequate.
11 This includes, but is not limited to, Mitigation Measures for:
12 a. Dangers posed to biological resources and special-status species;
13 b. Noise Impacts during construction and during operations;
14 C. Aesthetics;

15 d. Traffic and VMTs;

16 e. GHGs;

17 f. Energy usage;

18 g. Hazardous materials in the Soil;

19 h. Adequacy of public services;
20 i. and Cumulative Impacts caused by the Project together with other current and future
21 projects in the area.

22 70. The EIR. also impermissibly defers formulation of Mitigation Measures, including, but
23 not limited to, Mitigation Measures for:

24 a. Danger to biological resources and Special-Status Species;
25 b. and Noise Impacts during construction and during operations.
26

27

28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

15 -

71. The City of Grass Valley must consider Mitigation Measures to alleviate these dangers

2 and concerns and propose feasible Mitigation Measures. CEQA Guidelines §15088.5(a)(3).

3

4 FOURTH CAUSE OF ACTION

5 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: Inadequate Responses to Comments)

6 72. Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1

7 through 41, above, inclusive, as though each were fully set forth herein.
73. Respondent failed to respond reasonably and/or adequately to Comments submitted by
Petitioners, and by other members of the Public. Petitioners' Public Comments regarding the Project's
9 Impacts to, air quality, traffic, as well as Cumulative and Growth Inducing Impacts, impacts to the local
10 lifestyle, public services, transportation and traffic, population and housing, and regarding the adequacy
11 of the EIR's treatment of Mitigation Measures and Alternatives are conclusory, dismissive, evasive,

12 confusing, or otherwise non-responsive and contrary to the requirements of CEQA.

13 74. By failing to provide adequate Responses to Public Comments and proposed Alternatives,

14 Respondents failed to proceed in the manner required by law. Moreover, Respondents' Finding that
adequate Responses to Comments were provided is not supported by substantial evidence in the
15 administrative record.
16

17 FIFTH CAUSE OF ACTION

18 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: Respondent's Adoption of the Statement of Overriding Considerations

19 is Not Supported by Substantial Evidence in the Record)
75.
20 Petitioners hereby reallege and incorporate the allegations contained in Paragraphs 1

21 through 41, above, inclusive, as though each were fully set forth herein.
76. A Statement of Overriding Considerations is reasonably adequate if the Lead Agency
22 finds that "the specific economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits of a proposed project
23 outweigh the unavoidable adverse environmental effects." CEQA Guidelines, § 15093(a) This
24 determination must be supported by substantial evidence in the record. Id. at § 15093(b).

25 77. Respondent failed to proceed in a manner required by law when it adopted the Statement

26 of Overriding Considerations. Its decision to do so was not supported by Substantial Evidence in the

27 Record because Respondent failed to prepare a legally adequate EIR that: (i) contained an adequate
Project Description; (ii) detailed the specific Impacts caused by construction and operation of the Project
28

VERIFIED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

- 16 -

- on the environment and on human health; or (iii) contained reasonable or adequate Findings.

2 Respondent further failed to consider all feasible Mitigation Measures, or Alternatives, to avoid, or
reduce, Significant Impacts caused by the Project.
3 78. Respondent's actions in adopting the Statement of Overriding Considerations and the
4 Findings underlying the EIR, the subsequent Certification of the EIR and granting of the Approvals, and
5 the approval of the Project, constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion in violation of CEQA.

6

PRAYER FOR RELIEF 7

WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray for judgment and relief as follows:
9 1. This Court issue a Peremptory Writ of Mandate directing the City to:
10 a. Vacate and set aside the Certification of the EIR;

12 C. Comply with CEQA by preparing legally adequate environmental review for the
13 Project;

14 d. Refrain from issuing or approving any further permits or entitlements for the
15 Project until the City has prepared and certified a legally adequate environmental review for the Project
16 and complied with all other requirements of CEQA, as directed by this Court pursuant to PRC §
17 21168.9;

18 2. This a Court issue a Writ of Mandate directing Respondent and RPI to suspend all
19 necessary steps and all activity in furtherance of the Project until the City takes all necessary steps to
20 bring its actions into compliance with CEQA;

22 4. Petitioners be awarded reasonable attorneys' fees for this action pursuant to CCP §
23 1021.5, and any other applicable provisions of law; and
