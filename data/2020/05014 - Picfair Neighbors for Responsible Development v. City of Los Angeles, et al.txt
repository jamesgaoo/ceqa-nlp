1 Petitioner, PICFAIR NEIGHBORS FOR RESPONSIBLE DEVELPOMENT
2 ("Petitioner"), alleges through this Verified Second Amended Petition for Writ of Mandate

3 (*Petition"), as follows:

INTRODUCTION 4

5 1. Petitioner challenges the approval by the City of Los Angeles ("City" or
6 l "Respondent") of an environmental exemption determination ("Exemption") and the related
approvals and permits designed to facilitate a development project proposed at 1546-1550 S.
8 Orange Grove Avenue, Los Angeles, CA (together, the "Project"). The approval of the Project
was contrary to state and local laws and was premised on incentives improperly awarded
10 pursuant to an improperly approved set of guidelines.

11 2. Petitioner also brings an as applied challenge to the Transit Oriented R Channel 'dnoJg Mey d77 LIZ06 12 Communities Affordable Housing Incentive Program Guidelines (the "TOC Guidelines"). By

8 eyns "paig aulys!!m €:eg 13 adopting the TOC Guidelines outside the voter-approved process and the City charter,
'SI!H Auesag 14 Respondent exceeded the authority granted to it by the voters and its own laws.

15 3. Petitioner requests that this Court vacate, set aside, rescind and void all of the
16 permits and approvals ("Project Approvals") adopted by the City in order to facilitate the Project.
17 The Project was approved by the City of Los Angeles on or about October 25, 2018. Petitioner
18 requests that the Court vacate the Project Approvals because Respondent failed to comply with
19 the provisions set forth under the California Environmental Quality Act, Public Resources Code
20 section 21000, et seq. ("CEQA"), the State Planning and Zoning Law, and local laws and
21 therefore failed to proceed in manner required by law.

22 4. Petitioner seeks a Peremptory Writ of Mandate under California Code of Civil
23 Procedure section 1094.5, directing Respondent to vacate, rescind and set aside all Project
24 Approvals and the determination that the Project is exempt because Respondent failed to comply
25 with CEQA and applicable state and local laws.

2 5. Petitioner, PICFAIR NEIGHBORS FOR RESPONSIBLE DEVELOPMENT, is

3 an unincorporated association dedicated to the protection of both the community and the
environment of the Picfair neighborhood of Los Angeles. Petitioner and its respective members
5 have a direct and substantial beneficial interest in ensuring that Respondent complies with laws
relating to environmental protection. Petitioner and its respective members are adversely affected
7 by Respondents' failure to comply with CEQA in approving the Project. Petitioner has standing 6

8 to assert the claims raised in this Petition because Petitioner and its members' aesthetic and

9 environmental interests are directly and adversely affected by Respondent's' approval of the
10 Project. Petitioner's members participated in the approval process for the Project, appealing the

11 decision of the Director of Planning and submitting written comments to the Planning 8 d11 'dnoJg Mel ¡euueyo +Z06 6. Respondent and Defendant, CITY OF LOS ANGELES (the "City"), is charter 12 Commission during the appeal.

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS 5

Project 6

7 11. The Project consists of the demolition of an existing three-unit multi-family

8 dwelling and the construction, use, and maintenance of a five-story, 28-unit multi-family

9 dwelling with three (3) units set aside for Extremely Low-Income Households. The Project will

10 provide 34 residential automobile parking spaces within two (2) subterranean levels, and 28
11 long-term and three (3) short-term bicycle parking spaces.
LLZ06 euns "pajg A F SEM G E 8383 Wilshi 12 12. As proposed, the Project would, with a maximum height of 53 feet and 2 inches,
13 be the tallest structure in Picfair Village, despite being located on a residential a street in the 8
'SIl!H Auereg 14 village, as opposed to a major thoroughfare such as Venice Boulevard or Pico Boulevard.
15 13. While the subject property is zoned R3 (Multiple Dwelling), the parcels to the
16 east adjacent to the subject property are zoned R2 (Two-Family). Department of City Planning
17 staff found that the properties to the east are "developed with duplexes," but the properties to the
18 east adjacent to the Project are, in fact, single family houses.
19 14. On July 18, 2018, the Director of Planning adopted a determination of the
20 applicability of the Transit Oriented Communities Affordable Housing Incentive Program (the
21 "Letter of Determination") and found that the Project qualified for a categorical exemption from
22 CEQA.

23 15. In the Letter of Determination, Department of City Planning staff approved a
24 building height for the Project of 53 feet and two inches, instead of the 33 feet required by the
25 applicable [Q] Condition, as Tier 3 project under the Transit Oriented Communities ("TOC")
26 Affordable Housing Incentive Program.

16. In the Letter of Determination, Department of City Planning staff found:
The project site is approximately 1,584 feet from the intersection of Metro
Rapid 780 and Big Blue Bus Rapid 7 which intersect at Pico Boulevard
and Fairfax Avenue and operate with average frequencies of service
intervals of less than 15 minutes. As such, the project meets the eligibility
requirement for a TOC Housing Development to be located within 1,500
feet of a Major Transit Stop consisting of two (2) rapid bus routes.
8 17. Department of City Planning staff reasoned that "the subject property is Jocated
within a Tier 3 TOC Affordable Housing Incentive Area, qualified by its proximity to the
10| intersection of a Major Transit Stop. The subject property is approximately 1,500 feet of a Major
11 Transit Stop . . . As such, the project meets the eligibility requirements for proximity to a Major

15 19. On or about July 31, 2018, members of Petitioner, owners and residents in Picfair
16 Village living adjacent to the Project, appealed the approval and environmental determination to
17 the city Planning Commission as provided for by the Los Angeles Municipal Code. Petitioner
18 argued that the Project did not comply with the TOC Affordable Housing Initiative Program,
19 with the [Q] Conditions under Ordinance No. 179,884, and that Department of City Planning
20 staff erroneously determined that the Project was exempt from CEQA pursuant to CEQA
21 Guidelines, Section 15332, Article 19 (Class 32).
22 20. On October 25, 2018 the City Planning Commission held a hearing on the appeal.
23| The City Planning Commission denied the appeal, sustained the determination to approve the
24 Project as a Tier 3 TOC Affordable Housing Incentive Area, and reaffirmed that the Project was
25 exempt from CEQA.
26 21. The City Planning Commission concluded "based on the whole of the

near major transit stops; and 4) making other changes; be adopted? 17

18 24. The Chief Legislative Analyst for the City prepared an impartial analysis of
19 Measure JJJ, which explained that Measure JJJ "creates an affordable housing incentive program
20 with increased density and reduced parking requirements in areas within a one-half mile radius

21

25. Section 6 (Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC) § 12.22(A)(31)(b) provides that around a major transit stop."

24| Housing Incentive Program Guidelines (the "TOC Guidelines") that provide the eligibility
25 standards, incentives, and other necessary components of this TOC incentive program described

VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 purposes of this Subdivision and [that the TOC Guidelines] shall include [I" standards regarding
2 eligibility and incentives.

3 26. As adopted by the City Planning Commission, the TOC Guidelines depart from
the parameters and requirements of Measure JJJ in multiple respects.

27. Measure JJJ provides that the TOC Guidelines may allow different levels of

6 density increases based upon base zone and density, but the TOC Guidelines utilize system of
7 Tiers based on the distance from . Major Transit Stop. Under the TOC Guidelines, the Tiers

8 allow for different levels of density increases, regardless of the base zone or density of a specific
9 piece of property.
10 28. Measure JJJ also provides that TOC Guidelines must contain incentives
11 "consistent with the following" which include a residential density increase, adjustments to
LZ06 12 minimum square feet per dwelling unit, floor area ration, or both, as well as parking reductions.

18 CEOA'S SUBSTANTIVE AND PROCEDURAL REQUIREMENTS

19 29. In 1970, the California Legislature enacted CEQA, as a means of forcing public
20 agency decision makers, such as Respondent, to document and consider the environmental
21 implications of its actions. CEQA's fundamental goal is to fully inform the public and the
22 decision makers as to the environmental consequences of proposed projects and to assure
23 members of the public that their elected officials are making informed decisions. CEQA requires
24 governmental authorities, such as Respondent, to fully evaluate potential environmental effects
25 of projects, and to seek feasible means to reduce or avoid significant environmental damage that
26 otherwise could result from their actions, CEQA limits agencies from approving projects with
27

significant adverse impacts when feasible alternatives can substantially lessen such impacts.

30. The primary function of an Environmental Impact Report ("EIR") is to discuss the
3 important environmental consequences of the project, including cumulative effects, and to 2

provide the agency and the general public with mitigation measures and alternatives to the
5 project that would have Jess serious environmental consequences. Under CEQA lead agencies,

6 such as Respondent, are required to prepare a complete and legally adequate EIR prior to
approving any discretionary project that may have a significant adverse effect on the
environment. The EIR must fully disclose and adequately analyze the project's potentially

measures 9  significant environmental effects. CEQA also requires lead agencies, such as Respondent, to
10  consider mitigation measures and alternatives to a project, adopt all feasible mitigation
11 and/or alternatives, determine whether proposed mitigation measures will be effective in 8 d71'dnoJg MET |euueud LLZ06 alNS "pAja BJlYSIIM E8E8 12 avoiding or substantially lessening the project's significant environmental impacts, and to make

18 31. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
19 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
20 32. As applied to the Project, the TOC Guidelines are unlawful because they grant
21 incentives that are contrary to Measure JJJ and the requirements of the Los Angeles Municipal
22 Code.
23 33. Measure JJJ authorizes incentives for density increases and parking, but does not
24 authorize incentives for increased height, reduced open space, or reduced side or front yards.
25 Voters adopted Measure JJJ with the understanding that projects under the TOC Affordable
26 Housing Incentive Program would provide density increases and reduced parking requirements.

VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

34. The TOC Guidelines depart from the framework approved by voters and overturn
2 the development standards adopted by the Los Angeles City Council through "tiers." By
3 allowing increasing density with proximity to transit, the TOC Guidelines effectively create new
4 zones, which are not authorized by the general plan or Measure JJJ.

5 35. The TOC Guidelines are so wide reaching for land use in the City of Los Angeles

6 that they effectively constitute an amendment of the general plan, but the TOC Guidelines were
7 not adopted consistent with a general plan amendment, or even by the City Council. By allowing
8 for increased height and other incentives not provided for in Measure JJJ, Respondent has
9 effectively rendered the general plan amendment moot, creating inconsistencies within the
10 general plan in violation of state law. (Gov. Code, sec. 65300.5.)
11 36. In approving this Project, Respondent has violated its own laws by application of 0344
'dnoJp MET 90211 LAIS PN S UHL SLIPA SOCE S|lH Auerea 12 the TOC. Guidelines.
13 37. In adopting TOC Guidelines inconsistent with Measure JJJ, the City Planning
14 Department and City Planning Commission abused their discretion and adopted TOC Guidelines
jauueuo 15 in an arbitrary and capricious manner. As applied to this project, the TOC Guidelines are void.
16 For this reason, the general plan, Wilshire Community Plan, and [Q] conditions applicable to the
17 Project are not overridden by the TOC Guidelines.
SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION 18

19 (VIOLATION OF LOCAL ZONING LAW: Project Inconsistent with TOC Guidelines)
20 (Code of Civ. Proc., § 1085)
21 38. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
22 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
23 39. The Project is not consistent with the TOC Affordable Housing Incentive
24 Program, as adopted, and is not consistent with the applicable zoning, adopted to ensure
25 consistency with the General Plan and the Wilshire Community Plan.
26 40. Judicial review in actions brought for violation of CEQA is generally limited to

6 makes its decision in the record, judicial review should be confined to the record.

8 floor area ratio ("FAR") by 50%, while permitting eligible projects within Tier 2 to increase 7 41. The TOC Guidelines, as adopted, permit eligible projects within Tier 3 to increase

9 FAR by 45%. In order to award a project with Tier 3 status under the TOC Guidelines, the
10 Director of City Planning must find that the project is "within 1,500 feet of a major Transit stop

16| "project site is approximately 1,500 feet of a major Transit Stop" (emphasis added). Neither
17 adequately supports the finding that the Project qualified for Tier 3 status. Chart 1 in the TOC
18 Guidelines clearly shows that development needs to be less than 1,500 feet to a major transit stop
19 to qualify for Tier 3 (<1,500), not less than or equal to, and not approximately equal to.
The staff report to the Planning Commission on appeal of the Letter of
21 Determination acknowledged that the Director of City Planning had mistakenty identified the 20 43.

22 distance as 1,582 feet (not 1,584 feet as stated in the Letter of Determination), and explained that
23 the Project is "actually located 1,191 feet from the intersection, with the Deputy City Attorney
24 explaining that that the measure is a half-mile radius from a major transit stop. This measure of
25 distance remains flawed. The purpose of distinguishing between the Tiers in the TOC Guidelines

26 is accessibility to major transit stops, and riders of public transit cannot walk through buildings

1 or backyards.

44. Even if the Project was located in a Tier 3 incentive area, the project is still not
3 consistent with the TOC requirements. Section V.4 of the TOC Guidelines provide:

4 Design Conformance. Projects seeking to obtain Additional Incentives
5 shall be subject to any applicable design guidelines, including any

6 Community design guidelines, Specific Plan design guidelines and/or
7 Citywide Plan design guidelines and may be subject to conditions to meet
8 design performance. The conditions shall not preclude the ability to
construct the building with the residential density permitted by Section VI
10 [i.e. base incentives] (emphasis added).

13 and landscaping requirements. No conditions were adopted to meet design performance of the 8
SIIIH Ápaneg 14 | requirements of the applicable [Q] condition.
15 46. For these reasons, even if the TOC Guidelines can be lawfully applied to the

16 Project in question, Respondent acted arbitrarily and capriciously by granting Tier 3 incentives,
17 and additional incentives for height and open space in conflict with the applicable [Q] condition.

THIRD CAUSE OF ACTION 18

19 (VIOLATION OF CEQA: Improper Adoption of Exemption)

(Code of Civ. Proc., § 1094.5) 20

21 47. Petitioner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the preceding paragraphs in
22 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
23 48. Respondent improperly concluded that the Project qualified for a Class 32
24 categorical exemption under CEQA. Respondent abused its discretion and failed to act in a
25 manner required by law.
26 49. The Class 32 categorical exemption is subject to five exceptions relating to plan

VERIFIED SECOND AMENDED PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDATE

1 and zoning consistency (14 Cal Code Regs § 15332(a)), size and location of the site (14 Cal

3 Cal Code Regs § 15332(d)), and utilities and public services (14 Cal Code Regs § 15332(e)).

4 50. To qualify for a Class 32 categorical exemption, a project must be consistent with
the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies, in addition to any
applicable zoning designations and regulations. 14 Cal Code Regs 15332(a).
51. As explained above, the TOC Guidelines are void ultra vires as applied to the
Project, and even if the TOC Guidelines were not, the Project is not eligible for Tier 3 incentives

4 for density, or the additional incentives for height or open space. Accordingly, Wollmer v. City of

10 Berkeley (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 1329 is not applicable in determining whether the Project is
11 consistent with the applicable general plan and zoning for the purposes of a Class 32 categorical 2 d17 'dnoJo MET jauueyo 4LZ06 12 exemption (holding it proper to apply the provisions of state density bonus law (DBL) when

17 | including any Community Plan design guidelines, Specific Plan design guidelines, and/or City-
18 wide Design Guidelines and may be subject to conditions to meet design performance."
19 53. The Project is not consistent with the development standards specified in the [Q]
20 conditions, Wilshire Community Plan, or General Plan Framework.

21 54. To qualify for a Class 32 categorical exemption, a project must not result in any

23 15332(d). The acoustical engineer's report prepared on behalf of the Real Party in Interest 22 significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality. 14 Cal Code Regs

2 Community Plan takes notice that "[d]ue to the existing level of traffic congestion, the impact of 1

3 new large projects on traffic circulation will continue to be a major concern in the community."

4 55. To qualify for a Class 32 categorical exemption, a project must be adequately

5 served by required utilities and public services, 14 Cal Code Regs § 15332(e). The neighborhood

6 is served by aging infrastructure, including a sewer line on the block of the Project that was

7 installed in 1927. The neighborhood already experiences a high number of water leaks, as many
8 of the water lines in the area are between 75 and 100 years old.

56. With multiple exceptions applicable, Respondent abused its discretion and failed
10 to proceed in a manner required by law when it adopted the Class 32 categorical exemption.

15 their entirety, as though fully set forth herein.
16 58. Referral of the appeal hearing to the Los Angeles City Council Planning and Land
17 Use Management Committee (the "PLUM Committee") violated CEQA.
18 59. Public Resources Code § 21151(c) provides that if a nonelected body of the lead
19 agency determines that a project is exempt from CEQA, the determination may be appealed to
20 "the agency's elected decisionmaking body, if any."
21 60. After Respondent submitted an appeal pursuant to Public Resources Code §
22 21151(c), the City scheduled a public hearing for the appeal before the PLUM Committee.
23 61. Neither the Los Angeles Municipal Code or CEQA authorize the City Council to
24 delegate any portion of an appeal under Public Resources Code § 21151(c) to a subordinate
25 hearing officer or committee. Only five of the fifteen city council members serve on the PLUM

1 members of PLUM committee are elected to the City Council, but the City Council, not the
2 PLUM committee is the elected decisionmaking body for the City of Los Angeles.

3 62. The referral to the PLUM Committee is also inconsistent with City Council Rule

4 Nos. 8 and 16. Rule No. 16 provides, in relevant part:

5 The Presiding Officer shall cause all matters filed with, or presented to the

6 Council to be referred to the appropriate Council Committee except, as

7 otherwise provided by the Rules or where required by law to be first

8 presented to the Council.

9 63. Rule No. 8 provides, in relevant part:

10 Public hearing items scheduled for regular meetings are afforded special

13 applicants, appellants and property owners) shall be given a reasonable 8 14 opportunity to present oral arguments for or against any proposed action. 'SIllH AueAeg 15 64. Under Public Resources Code § 21151(c), the legislature authorized CEQA

16 appeals to elected decisionmaking bodies. The City's actions as described above therefore
17 violate Public Resources Code § 21151(c).

Re: Notice of Intent to Commence CEQA Action and Proceeding; 1546-1550 S. Orange Grove Avenue, DIR-2018-894-TOC; ENV-2018-895-CE

To Whom It May Concern:
PLEASE TAKE NOTICE, under California Public Resources Code section 21167.5, that Petitioner, Picfair Neighbors for Responsible Development, intends to immediately file a Petition for Writ of Mandate ("Petition") under the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (*CEQA"), inter alia, against the City of Los Angeles ("City"). The Petition will be filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court and will allege, inter alia, that the City did not comply with the California Environmental Quality Act when it approved the development project proposed at 1546- 1550 S. Orange Grove Avenue ("Project"). Namely, the City improperly concluded that the Project was exempt from CEQA. Further, the Petition will allege that the City abused its discretion when it approved the Project because the Project does not conform to all applicable zoning and municipal code regulations (as well as the City's TOC Guidelines).
